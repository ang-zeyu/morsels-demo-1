Galloping among them suddenly  he shouted, \"Throw down your arms or you are all dead men!\" Whereupon  they all threw down their arms; and his troopers led them off.  Patterson, badly served by his very raw staff, reported Jackson's  little vanguard as being precisely ten times stronger than it was.  He pushed out cautiously to right and left; and when he tried to  engage again he found that Jackson had withdrawn. Falling Waters was  microscopically small as a fight. But it served to raise Confederate  morale and depress the Federals correspondingly.    Patterson occupied Martinsburg, while Johnston, drawn up in line  of battle, awaited his further advance four days before retiring.  Then, with his fourteen thousand, Patterson advanced again, stood  irresolute under distracting orders from the Government in Washington,  and finally went to Charlestown on the seventeenth of July--almost  back to Harper's Ferry. Johnston, with his eleven thousand, now  stood fast at Winchester, fifteen miles southwest, while Stuart,  like a living screen, moved to and fro between them.    Meanwhile McDowell's thirty-six thousand had marched past the President  with bands playing and colors flying amid a scene of great enthusiasm.  The press campaign was at its height; so was the speechifying;  and ninety-nine people out of every hundred thought Beauregard's  twenty-two thousand at Bull Run would be defeated in a way that  would be sure to make the South give in. McDowell had between two  and three thousand regulars: viz., seven troops of cavalry, nine  batteries of artillery, eight companies of infantry, and a little  battalion of marines. Then there was the immense paper army voted  on the Glorious Fourth. And here, for the general public to admire,  was a collection of armed and uniformed men that members of Congress  and writers in the press united in calling one of the best armies  the world had ever seen. Moreover, the publicity campaign was kept  up unflaggingly till the very clash of arms began. Reporters marched  along and sent off reams of copy. Congressmen, and even ladies,  graced the occasion in every way they could. \"The various regiments  were brilliantly uniformed according to the Ã¦sthetic taste of peace,\"  wrote General Fry, then an officer on McDowell's staff, and \"during  the nineteenth and twentieth the bivouacs at Centreville, almost  within cannon range of the enemy, were thronged with visitors,  official and unofficial, who came in carriages from Washington,  were under no military restraint, and passed to and fro among the  troops as they pleased, giving the scene the appearance of a monster  military picnic.\"    Had McDowell been able to attack on either of these two days he  must have won. But previous Governments had never given the army  the means of making proper surveys; so here, within a day's march  of the Federal capital, the maps were worthless for military use.  Information had to be gleaned by reconnaissance; and reconnaissance  takes time, especially without trustworthy guides, sufficient cavalry,  and a proper staff. Moreover, the army was all parts and no whole,  through no fault of McDowell's or of his military chiefs. The  three-month volunteers, whose term of service was nearly over,  had not learned their drill as individuals before being herded  into companies, battalions, and brigades, of course becoming more  and more inefficient as the units grew more and more complex. Of  the still more essential discipline they naturally knew still less.  There was no lack of courage; for these were the same breed of  men as those with whom Washington had won immortal fame, the same  as those with whom both Grant and Lee were yet to win it. But,  as Napoleon used to say, mere men are not the same as soldiers.  Nor are armed mobs the same as armies.    The short march to the front was both confused and demoralizing.  No American officer had ever had the chance even of seeing, much  less handling, thirty-six thousand men under arms. This force was  followed by an immense and unwieldy train of supplies, manned by  wholly undisciplined civilian drivers; while other, and quite  superfluous, civilians clogged every movement and made confusion  worse confounded. \"The march,\" says Sherman, who commanded a brigade,  \"demonstrated little save the general laxity of discipline; for,  with all my personal efforts, I could not prevent the men from  straggling for water, blackberries, or anything on the way they  fancied.\" In the whole of the first long summer's day, the sixteenth  of July, the army only marched six miles; and it took the better  part of the seventeenth to herd its stragglers back again. \"I wished  them,\" says McDowell, \"to go to Centreville the second day [only  another six miles out] but the men were foot-weary, not so much  by the distance marched as by the time they had been on foot.\"  That observant private, Warren Lee Goss, has told us how hard it  is to soldier suddenly. \"My canteen banged against my bayonet; both  tin cup and bayonet badly interfered with the butt of my musket,  while my cartridge-box and haversack were constantly flopping up  and down--the whole jangling like loose harness and chains on a  runaway horse.\" The weather was hot. The roads were dusty. And  many a man threw away parts of his kit for which he suffered later  on. There was food in superabundance. But, with that unwieldy and  grossly undisciplined supply-and-transport service, the men and  their food never came together at the proper time.    Early on the eighteenth McDowell, whose own work was excellent  all through, pushed forward a brigade against Blackburn's Ford,  toward the Confederate right, in order to distract attention from  the real objective, which was to be the turning of the left. The  Confederate outposts fell back beyond the ford. The Federal brigade  followed on; when suddenly sharp volleys took it in front and flank.  The opposing brigade, under Longstreet (of whom we shall often  hear again), had lain concealed and sprung its trap quite neatly.  Most of the Federals behaved extremely well under these untoward  circumstances. But one whole battery and another whole battalion,  whose term of service expired that afternoon, were officially reported  as having \"moved to the rear to the sound of the enemy's cannon.\"  Thereafter, as military units, they simply ceased to exist.    At one o'clock in the morning of this same day Johnston received  a telegram at Winchester, from Richmond, warning him that McDowell  was advancing on Bull Run, with the evident intention of seizing  Manassas Junction, which would cut the Confederate rail communication  with the Shenandoah Valley and so prevent all chance of immediate  concentration at Bull Run. Johnston saw that the hour had come.  It could not have come before, as Lee and the rest had foreseen;  because an earlier concentration at Bull Run would have drawn the  two superior Federal forces together on the selfsame spot. There  was still some risk about giving Patterson the slip. True, his  three-month special-constable array was semi-mutinous already; and  its term of service had only a few more days to run. True, also,  that the men had cause for grievance. They were all without pay,  and some of them were reported as being still \"without pants.\" But,  despite such drawbacks, a resolute attack by Patterson's fourteen  thousand could have at least held fast Johnston's eleven thousand,  who were mostly little better off in military ways. Patterson,  however, suffered from distracting orders, and that was his undoing.  Johnston, admirably screened by Stuart, drew quietly away, leaving  his sick at Winchester and raising the spirits of his whole command  by telling them that Beauregard was in danger and that they were  to \"make a forced march to save the country.\"    Straining every nerve they stepped out gallantly and covered mile  after mile till they reached the Shenandoah, forded it, and crossed  the Blue Ridge at Ashby's Gap. But lack of training and march discipline  told increasingly against them. \"The discouragement of that day's  march,\" said Johnston, \"is indescribable. Frequent and unreasonable  delays caused so slow a rate of marching as to make me despair of  joining General Beauregard in time to aid him.\" Even the First  Brigade, with all the advantages of leading the march and of having  learnt the rudiments of drill and discipline, was exhausted by a  day's work that it could have romped through later on. Jackson  himself stood guard alone till dawn while all his soldiers slept.    As Jackson's men marched down to take the train at Piedmont, Stuart  gayly trotted past, having left Patterson still in ignorance that  Johnston's force had gone. By four in the afternoon of the nineteenth  Jackson was detraining at Manassas. But, as we shall presently  see, it was nearly two whole days before the last of Johnston's  brigades arrived, just in time for the crisis of the battle. When  Johnston had joined Beauregard their united effective total was  thirty thousand men. There had been a wastage of three thousand.  McDowell also had no more than thirty thousand effectives present  on the twenty-first; for he left one division at Centreville and  lost the rest by straggling and by the way in which the battery  and battalion already mentioned had \"claimed their discharge\" at  Blackburn's Ford. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth, while,  sorely against his will, the Federals were having their \"monster  military picnic\" at Centreville, he was reconnoitering his constantly  increasing enemy under the greatest difficulties, with his ill-trained  staff, bad maps, and lack of proper guides.    Lee had chosen six miles of Bull Run as a good defensive position.  But Beauregard intended to attack, hoping to profit by the Federal  disjointedness. Consequently none of the eight fords were strongly  defended except at Union Mills on the extreme right and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#6)"],[1,"Boers, dominated and led by better       educated foreign adventurers--Germans, Hollanders, Irish Home       Rulers, and other European Republicans and Socialists--will       become a pest to the whole of South Africa, and a most dangerous       fulcrum to any European Power bent on contesting our naval       supremacy, or injuring us in our colonies.         \"There is no escaping from the responsibility which has already       been incurred, ever since the British flag was planted on the       Castle here. All our real difficulties have arisen, and still       arise, from attempting to evade or shift this responsibility....       If you abdicate the sovereign position, the abdication has always       to be heavily paid for in both blood and treasure.... Your object       is not conquest, but simply supremacy up to Delagoa Bay. This       will have to be asserted some day, and the assertion will not       become easier by delay. The trial of strength will be forced on       you, and neither justice nor humanity will be served by       postponing the trial if we start with a good cause.\"    Could not the man who foresaw these dangers have prevented them? It is  impossible to resist the momentum of this thought.    [Sidenote: The retrocession.]    The events by which this forecast was so closely realised are not  likely to be effaced from the memory of this generation. Frere had  scarcely left the Colony from which he had been recalled by the joint  efforts of Mr. Krueger and Lord (then Mr.) Courtney before the former,  with his fellow triumvirs, had raised the Vier-kleur upon the still  desolate uplands of the Witwatersrand. The attempt to put down by  force the Boer revolt of 1880-81 failed. Mr. Gladstone's cabinet  recoiled before the prospect of a war in which the Boers might have  been supported by their kinsmen in the Free State and the Cape Colony.  The retrocession of the Transvaal under the terms of the Pretoria  Convention (1881) was followed by further concessions embodied in the  London Convention of 1884. It is absolutely established as fact that  Mr. Gladstone's Government intended, by certain articles contained in  both conventions, to secure to all actual and potential British  residents in the Transvaal the enjoyment of all the political rights  of citizenship possessed by the Boers. But it is equally certain that  the immediate contravention of Article XVI. of the Pretoria  Convention, when in 1882 the period of residence necessary to qualify  for the franchise was raised from two to five years, was allowed to  pass without protest from the Imperial Government. And thus a breach  of the Convention, which the discovery of the Witwatersrand  gold-fields (1886) and the subsequent establishment of a great British  industrial community made a matter of vital importance, was condoned.  A few years more and the country which prided itself upon being the  home of liberty and of free institutions was confounded by the  spectacle of a South Africa of its own making, in which a British  majority denied the franchise in a Dutch Republic, contrasted with a  Dutch minority dominating and controlling the machinery of responsible  government in a British colony.    This situation brings us (to use a military phrase) within striking  distance of the objective of the present work--the personality and  efforts of the man who administered South Africa in the momentous  years of the struggle for equal rights for all white men from the  Zambesi to Capetown.    If the records set out in the preceding pages leave any impression  upon the mind, it is one that must produce a sense of amazement,  almost exasperation, at the thought of the many mistakes and disasters  that might have been avoided, if only greater weight had been attached  to the advice tendered to the British Government by its local  representative in South Africa. And with this sense of amazement a  generous mind will associate inevitably a feeling of regret for the  injustice unwittingly, but none the less irreparably, inflicted upon  loyal and capable servants of the Crown--an injustice so notorious  that it has made South Africa the \"grave of reputations.\" Apart from  the pre-eminence with which the period of Lord Milner's administration  is invested by the occurrence within it of a military conflict of  unparalleled magnitude, Lord Milner stands out in the annals of South  Africa as the first High Commissioner whose knowledge of South African  conditions was allowed to inspire the policy of the Home Government,  and who himself was recognised by the Government and people of Great  Britain as voicing the convictions and aspirations of all loyal  subjects of the Crown in that province of the empire.    The state of affairs with which Lord Milner was called upon to deal  was in its essence the situation sketched by Frere twenty years before  in the memorable forecast to which reference has been made. But the  working of the forces indicated by Frere as destined, if unchecked, to  drive England one day to a life-and-death struggle for her supremacy  in South Africa, had been complicated by an event which cannot be  omitted altogether from a chapter intended, like a Euripidean  prologue, to prepare the mind of the spectator for the proper  understanding of the characters and action of the drama. This event is  the Jameson Raid.    [Sidenote: The Jameson raid.]    [Sidenote: Rhodes.]    In order to see the Jameson Raid in its true perspective, it is not  sufficient to place it in relationship to those familiar and notorious  events by which it was followed. It must also be placed in relationship  to the no less clearly defined events by which it was preceded. Thus  placed it becomes the direct outcome of the refusal of the Imperial  Government to use the advice of its local representative--or, more  precisely, of the refusal to base its policy on South African instead  of British conditions: and, as such, it convinced the Imperial  Government of the need of reviving the power of its local  representative. In other words, it is a connecting link between the High  Commissionerships of Frere and Milner. The events which followed the  recall of Frere were accepted by the British inhabitants of South Africa  as a practical demonstration of the inherent viciousness of the system  under which the decision of cardinal questions of South African  administration was left in the hands of the House of Commons, a body in  which they were not represented; which met 6,000 miles away; whose  judgment was liable to be warped by irrelevant considerations of English  party politics; and one which was admittedly unfamiliar with the country  and peoples whose interests were vitally affected by the manner in which  these questions were decided. The lesson of the retrocession was taken  to heart so earnestly that, fifteen years later, the majority of the  British residents in the Transvaal refused to support a movement for  reform which involved the re-establishment of Imperial authority, while  among those who were loyal to the British connection throughout South  Africa its effect was to make them think, as did Rhodes, that the  machinery of the various local British governments must be dissociated  as much as possible from the principles and methods of the Home  Government. Hence the necessity for what Rhodes called the \"elimination  of the Imperial factor.\" The expression, as he afterwards explained,  was in no way inconsistent with attachment to the British connection. As  read in the context in which it was originally used, it meant merely  that the European population of Bechuanaland,[9] being mainly Boer  immigrants, could be administered more successfully by officers  responsible to a government which, like that of the Cape Colony, was  well versed in South African conditions, than by officers directly  responsible to the Imperial Government. The phrase was a criticism of  Downing Street, and still more of English party government. In short,  Rhodes was convinced that if a system of British administration, based  on South African conditions, was ever to be carried on successfully, the  local British authority, and not the Home Government, must be the  machine employed; and in order to allow it to work freely, its action  must be made as independent as possible of Downing Street. For Downing  Street was an authority which blew hot or cold, in accordance with the  views of the party for the time being in power.[10]             [Footnote 9: The Crown Colony--not the Protectorate--annexed           by the Cape Colony in 1895.]             [Footnote 10: Rhodes's words were: \"If we do not settle this           [_i.e._ the question of Bechuanaland] ourselves, we shall see           it taken up in the House of Commons on one side or the other,           not from any real interest in the question, but simply           because of its consequences to those occupying the           Ministerial benches. We want to get rid of Downing Street in           this question, and to deal with it ourselves, as a           self-governing colony.\"]    [Sidenote: New forces.]    And, in point of fact, both parties in England acquiesced in this  judgment of the South African British. During the years between  Frere's recall and the appointment of Lord Milner (1880-1897) the High  Commissioner was a decreasing force. Both Lord Rosmead and Lord Loch  did little to mould the destiny of South Africa: not because they  lacked capacity, but because it was the determination of the Home  Government to leave the difficult problem of South African unity to  local initiative. On the other hand, the progress which was made in  this direction by local initiative, aided as it was by the fortuitous  discovery of the Witwatersrand gold-fields, was considerable. The  highlands of South Central Africa were acquired for the British race,  and the Boer was effectively prevented from carrying the Vier-kleur"]]]
