[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#6)"],[1," catch nearly  every mink that comes along. They very seldom miss the chance to  explore a hole of that kind. The old trapper that told me about this  set said that he caught twelve mink in one season at a place of this  kind, and all in the same trap, a No. 1 Newhouse. It had been a wet  season this year I speak of, and I will tell you how I trapped mink  in January and with six inches of snow on the ground.    The ditches and creeks all had water in them and were either frozen  over or covered with drifted snow. My best set was to set a couple of  traps in the warm water that came out of the tiles. A mink is a great  lover of water and will play in a place of this kind for half an hour  at a time, and two traps will almost catch him. Whenever there is a  small air hole in the ice he will investigate, and if you place the  trap directly under this hole he cannot very well miss getting  caught. For this set the water should not be over four inches deep.    After the mink makes a hole through the snow drift he will always  follow the same hole, will come into and go out of the water at  certain places, and a trap set at any of these places is almost sure  to catch.    As a scent bait, I use the matrix of the female mink taken in the  running season, and for fresh meat bait I use rat, but I prefer the  blind and water sets, and do not use the others until these two have  failed only in the latter part of February and March. With slight  changes I believe these sets can be used in most localities.    My experience in trapping is limited to one season, the last, during  which I trapped 39 mink, besides the five that left their legs in  traps and four taken by thieves and dogs. But my success has been so  much above that of others who have tried to duplicate my luck, that I  want to give some pointers to some who have not had satisfactory  results in trapping mink, says a South Dakota party.    This is a well settled prairie country, with one small creek running  through it, and an occasional slough. Game of all kind is pretty well  cleaned out. In fact, it was not generally known that any number of  mink existed here. Being quite a hunter with nothing to hunt, I  conceived the idea to trap a mink, and before I got through I found  the sport more enjoyable and profitable than hunting. I had no  trappers guide to help me, and it took me three weeks and more than a  dozen trips to my traps to catch the first mink. But during that time  my experience and observations were teaching me fast. And later when  I saw a trap at about every hole in the country with seldom a catch,  it amused me.    My receipt to a beginner is--get three sizes of traps, No. 0 to set  at holes, No. 1 to set in water or path, and Stop Thief to set over  holes that the others cannot be used at, or for sure catch when you  know mink to be in. See that your traps have strong springs, and that  when set fine the pan is on a level with jaws. All traps should be  alike in this respect. Now to prevent them from rusting as well as to  take the scent off, heat them enough to run some wax over them.    As to where to set them, you must find some signs of mink near water,  tracks in sand, droppings, or best of all, used holes. Now remember  you have to deal with some of the most intelligent but superstitious  and shy of animals. I kept one at my house for a while and found him  more intelligent than a cat or dog. They get bold and careless some  times, but not very often. Their holes are frequently shallow, and  they are suspicious of one's presence. The less you frequent the  place and tramp about his paths, the better. Avoid the hole if  possible.    First choice is to set the trap in shallow water on his runways,  sticking up weeds if necessary to make him go over the traps. The  next choice is where he goes in and out of the water. Next in dry  path and last at his hole where he is the most suspicious of  disturbance. Water set is the best and easiest, but even then the  trap should be covered with light mud.    On dry land you should leave the place looking as natural as before.  At the hole use a small trap, Blake & Lamb is the easiest and  quickest set. Remove enough dirt to sink the trap to a level. Set  trap with jaws never crossways to the hole. Have jaws rest so that  jaws will not tilt if stepped on. Now see that pan is set just about  right, not too easy, and now you are ready for the most important  part--to cover--so it will stay covered and spring regardless of  freezing, thawing, snowing, or blowing, and not to clog the jaws with  rubbish. It is too tedious to get the mink over the trap to have  something go wrong at the critical moment. I use brown tissue paper  or the fuzz from cattails, which I sprinkle with a little fine dirt  or rubbish at hand, the chain having been previously staked and hid.  All should now be left looking as natural as before, and one's tracks  obliterated.    A well set trap will not reveal itself to the game or to any other  trapper. A hole set trap should not be approached unnecessarily. Mink  will seldom get in the first night, and it takes too long to reset  them.    Mink will stay in holes several days if they fear danger. I had one  stay twelve days because there was a Stop Thief trap over the hole,  but I kept it there because there was a steam visible at the mouth of  the hole, and I got her. I have used scent to some advantage, not to  draw but to detract the mink's attention, but as to baits I have  faithfully tried them all from muskrat to a frog, and I have never  known a mink to approach any of them no matter where, when, or how  left, except if left by themselves.    In the fore part of the winter I caught about all the males, perhaps  because they were bolder. Later I got the females. The largest mink I  got stretched 42 inches from tip to tip, and his hide on a five inch  board was 24 inches. He was light brown. No. 0 held him by two toes.  In fact, I never lost a mink from that sized trap. Those that chewed  out were caught up too high.    My experience in trapping is altogether in mink and in a prairie  country, and it has always been a great pleasure and very profitable  for me, says an Iowa trapper. As I have said, trapping mink is a  science which few trappers understand, and can learn only by long  experience and close study. Any one taking two or three dozen traps  and stringing them out, setting in holes and ditches, can catch a few  mink. I know men who have trapped for years and claim to catch lots  of fur, but it makes me smile to see how they set them; they simply  don't know their A B C's about trapping mink.      [Illustration: MOSES BONE.]    The time that I have put in trapping mink for the last 37 years has  paid me bigger money than anything I ever tried; of course I mean  buying and shipping at the same time of trapping. Counting ten hours  as a day's work, I have cleared from five to twenty dollars per day.  Now as I said several years ago, I have no secret or I would let  brother trappers have it; I use no scent whatever but fresh bait,  which is all that is necessary.    You must learn by experience where and how to set your trap. That is  all the secret any mink trapper has. The method for setting for mink,  rats or coon are all the same, can catch either in the same trap.  Water set is my way of setting and far better than any other I think.  In ditches or streams where the water is shallow enough to set your  traps in where the current runs against the bank; then scoop out a  hole 8 inches into the bank. I have used a butcher knife to dig the  mud out with; the water must flow into the hole, which should be two  inches deep. Cut a forked stick, one prong one inch long, the other 6  or 8 inches long; sharpen it, run your bait on this, put the stick in  the back of the hole which fastens your bait.    Now set your trap, turn the spring to one side, fasten the chain the  handiest way you can so it is secure. I never had a mink cut his leg  off and get away. Now stick up weeds or sticks on either side of the  hole so the mink can't get the bait without stepping on the pan of  the trap. The current should run strongly over the trap so as to keep  the water from freezing, for there are very few nights after trapping  time sets in but that the water freezes in still water. I sometimes  dam the water to make it run strongly over the trap. Everything about  the trap should be left looking as natural as possible.    In cold weather I go on the same principle. When everything is frozen  solid I use a hatchet cutting a hole in the bank; use ice or chunks  of wood to make a lane to set your trap in, and throw your bait in as  far as you can get it. Of course you cannot fasten it.    To show how well animals can scent a bait or anything of that kind I  will relate an incident that happened several years ago. There was a  fresh fall of snow and being warm the skunk were out of their  burrows, and I was tracking one going southeast course. All at once  it turned square to the left going some thirty feet and came to an  old dried up mole covered with the snow. He nosed around it a while  and then went the same direction as before. That showed plainly that  animals can scent their game.        CHAPTER IX.    SOUTHERN METHODS.    On reading the methods used by the Northern mink trapper one is  almost forced to the conclusion that the mink there is a different  one from those here, (in Texas), but of course such is not the case.  My limited experience in trapping mink here has brought me to the  conclusion that they are not afraid of human scent, or old musty  traps either. My opinion is that it is the disturbed surroundings  that cause them to shy from the trap.    I once set a trap in a mink run in rather rank grass at 6 P.M. and  the next morning had a No. 1 mink in it (poor color of course). The  trap was not baited or scented and was set without gloves. Of course  I did not tread down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34098"],[0,"Science of Trapping (#6)"],[1," skins come from Labrador and the country  east and south of Hudson Bay, also from northern British Columbia and  the interior of Alaska and the Yukon province. The marten is strictly  an animal of the woods, being found only in the heavily timbered  country. Their favorite haunts are in the rough, broken country,  where the timber is of various kinds. They feed on rabbits,  squirrels, mice, birds and eggs and probably have no trouble in  obtaining a sufficient amount of food, but unlike the mink and the  weasel, they never kill more than is needed to supply their wants.    The young are usually born in April, and there are from three to five  at a birth. Just where they make their dens I cannot say. Some  writers say they live in hollow trees, while others assert that they  live in holes in the rocks or ground. I should say that the latter  idea is most likely to be correct, at least as regards the marten of  the far north, as in that part of the country, hollow trees are few  and far between. One peculiarity regarding the martens is the fact  that they occasionally disappear from a locality in which they were  formerly numerous. The common supposition is that they migrate to new  feeding grounds when food becomes scarce.    The marten travels mostly in the gullies and depressions on the  mountains and hills. As they usually follow the same route, when one  sees their tracks in such a place, he can be reasonably sure, if he  sets his trap there, that he will make a catch. They are not shy or  suspicious and are easily caught. In many ways, marten trapping is  the most pleasant as well as the most profitable kind of trapping. As  they are found only in the timbered country, the trapper does not  feel the storms like he would in an open country. They are easily  caught, light to carry and easily skinned. Moreover, they are a very  valuable fur and if one is in a good locality, he will make a large  catch in a season. They usually become prime about the 15th of  October and remain in good condition until the last of March.    In countries where the snow does not fall too deep, the traps are set  in small enclosures, the same as for the mink. If there is snow on  the ground, I set my traps as follows. With my snowshoes, I tramp the  snow down solid, at the foot of a tree, and build a small pen of  stakes, or chunks split from an old stump. The stakes or chunks, are  arranged so as to form the sides of the pen and the sides are placed  about six or seven inches apart, the tree forming the back of the  pen. I roof the pen with evergreen boughs, to protect the trap from  the falling snow. It is a good idea to leave a couple of boughs hang  down over the mouth of the pen so as to hide the bait from the birds,  and also to prevent the rabbits from entering the pen. I set the trap  on a bed of boughs, just inside of the pen, and cover lightly with  tips of evergreen. The bait is placed on a stick behind the trap. I  fasten the trap to a toggle, but if only marten is expected, the trap  may be fastened in almost any way, as they seldom escape. It is also  a good idea to bend a small twig and place it under the pan of the  trap, to prevent it from being sprung by birds, squirrels and  weasels.    For bait, rabbit, partridge, squirrel, fish, small birds or meat of  almost any kind is good. The Indians sometimes smoke-cure salmon,  pickerel, or white fish, for marten bait, and other trappers use  putrefied salmon roe, but the majority prefer to use fresh bait. Some  trappers advise dragging a piece of fresh, bloody meat along the  line, to lead the marten to the trap.        [Illustration: A Marten Set.]    Another very good method is the following: Find a small spruce, about  three inches in diameter and cut the tree about two feet above the  snow, leaving the top of the stump V shape. Draw the tree forward and  lay it over the stump, so that the butt of the tree will be three or  three and a half feet above the snow. Now, about a foot back from the  end, flatten off a place for the trap and set the trap on the pole.  Tie the trap fast with a light string and loop the chain around the  tree. Split the butt of the tree, and fasten the bait in the split.  This is a very good set, possessing advantages over most methods. The  birds can not eat the bait, the trap is not bothered by weasels or  rabbits, the marten must stand on the trap when trying to get the  bait, and when caught, falls off the pole and can not get back.    In the mountains, where the snow falls deep, the traps are set on the  trees, five or six feet above the snow. The most common way, is to  make two cuts in the tree with an axe, and drive in two wooden pegs,  about five inches apart. Set the trap and place it on the pegs, one  peg passing through the bow of the spring, the other between the jaws  and the bottom of the trap. Draw the chain around the tree and staple  solidly. The bait is pinned to the tree, about a foot above the trap.  A bunch of boughs may be placed over the bait to hide it from the  birds.    If desired, a notch may be cut in the tree and a trap set in the  notch. The notch should be about four inches deep and about twelve  inches from top to bottom. Cut the bottom smooth, so the trap will  set solid and fasten the bait in the top of the notch. Staple the  trap to the tree. If desired, you can lean a pole against the tree  for the marten to run up on, but this is not necessary.    The trapper should always be on the lookout for places in which the  trap may be set without much labor. Sometimes a tree can be found,  with a hollow in one side and this makes a good place for a set. Lean  a pole against the tree, with one end resting in the hollow, set a  trap on the pole and place a bait in the cavity above the trap. At  other times a cavity may be made in the side of a rotten stub and a  trap set in the same way. The traps recommended for marten are the  No. 1 of any make, but the No. 0 Newhouse is much used. If there are  fishers, lynx and other large animals about, it is best to use a No.  1 1/2 trap. Deadfalls are also used and they may be built on the  ground or snow, or on the top of a stump, or the side of a tree. The  track of the marten resembles that of the mink, except that it is a  trifle larger and the footprint wider in proportion to the length.  The toes do not make as clear a print as do those of the mink, the  feet being more heavily furred.      [Illustration: The Fisher.]        CHAPTER VI.    THE FISHER.    The fisher belongs to the weasel family and is classed by naturalists  among the martens, under the name of Pennant's Marten. To the  trappers, however, it is best known as the fisher, and in the Eastern  States and Eastern Canada, as the \"black cat\". It is strictly a North  American animal, being found scattered over a large part of Canada  and Alaska, and also in California and other parts of the Pacific  Coast, Northern Michigan, the Adirondack mountains of New York, the  White mountains of New Hampshire and in Northern Maine.    In general appearance, the fisher resembles both the marten and the  wolverine, but is larger than the former and smaller than the latter.  Compared with the marten, the ears are smaller and more rounded, the  tail longer and the animal is far more stoutly built. An average,  full size fisher, will measure two feet from the nose to the root of  the tail and will weigh from ten to fifteen pounds. The tail is  peculiar, and is the most valuable part of the skin; It measures,  usually, about sixteen inches in length, is heavily furred, thick at  the base, and tapers to a point. The color of the fur varies, some  specimens being very pale and others almost black. The general color  is a yellowish grey on the face, head and neck, light brown on the  back, dark brown on the hind-quarters and the tail and legs, a  brownish black. The under parts are darker than the back. The fur is  fairly fine and soft, though not nearly as fine as that of the  marten.    For its size, the fisher is an exceedingly powerful animal, and is  rather hard to hold in a trap, as it will struggle as long as life  lasts. The animal possesses a musk, having a peculiar, rank odor,  which it ejects when alarmed. The food of the fisher consists  principally of rabbits, partridges and other small animals and birds,  but it will scarcely refuse anything in the line of flesh,  occasionally eating mink, weasel, etc., out of traps. It also preys  on raccoons in the parts of its range where those animals are found  and sometimes kills and eats the porcupine. Neither is it a strictly  carnivorous animal, as it feeds largely on the berries of the  mountain ash and in seasons when these berries are plentiful, the  fisher does not take bait well. At such times the Indian trappers  will often use a bunch of mountain ash berries for bait.    They are found most plentiful on the higher ground, where the land is  fairly well timbered, and the surface of the country is very ragged.  They are great travelers and follow the wooded ravines whenever  possible. Like all other animals of a rambling nature, each  individual has its regular route of travel, and when you see a track,  especially in a ravine, you may be sure that the animal will come  that way again. The fur becomes prime about the first of November,  and remains in good condition until the first of April, or sometimes  longer. They are not very prolific, there being only from two to four  in a litter. The young are usually born in April.    Usually, the fisher is easily trapped and will enter the trap as  readily as the marten, but there are \"off seasons\" when food is  plenty and the animals are rather shy. On such occasions I have seen  them refuse to cross my trail in the snow. In most cases, however,  they will jump into the trail and follow it to the trap. When  trapped, the animal struggles violently and if the leg is broken, is  likely to twist off the foot and escape. It"]]]
