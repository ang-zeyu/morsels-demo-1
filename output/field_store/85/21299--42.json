The Governor took  the salute from a point opposite Government House. The Battalion  presented a fine spectacle, and received a magnificent reception from  the enormous crowds that thronged the thoroughfares. The newspapers, in  subsequently describing the proceedings, referred to an unprecedented  muster of the public and an extraordinary display of enthusiasm. The  people were evidently proud of their new unit, and the men had pride in  themselves.    During the first week in June, definite information was received as to  the transports allotted and the dates of embarkation. By the 6th June  everything was ready. On that day the 1st Reinforcements, consisting of  99 rank and file under the command of Lieut. J. F. Quilty, went on board  the transport \"Geelong,\" which had arrived in Fremantle the day before  and carrying the 27th Battalion. Dean Brennan also embarked, having been  ordered for duty with the South Australians during the remainder of  their voyage. Sergt. F. L. Faulkner, together with the 11 drivers and 53  horses of the Regimental Transport, was to follow by a boat the date of  sailing of which had not then been fixed.    At this time orders were received to detach Major F. R. Jeffrey  temporarily to act as Second-in-Command of the South Australian unit. He  duly reported and another officer, Lieut. P. E. Jackson, was sent on  shore in exchange. In consequence of this alteration, Captain W. G.  Stroud was given the temporary command of \"B\" Company.    On the afternoon of the 7th June, the Brigadier of the 7th Brigade,  Colonel J. Burston, V.D., accompanied by his Staff Captain, Captain M.  J. G. Colyer, visited the camp and made the acquaintance of this portion  of his command. The Brigadier, who had been personally known to the C.O.  for some years, expressed his pleasure at what he saw of the unit and of  its promise for usefulness and efficiency.    FOOTNOTES:    [A] _See_ Appendix A.    [B] This establishment was maintained until early in 1916, when  modifications were made during the Battalion's stay at Ferry Post.  Further material changes took place from time to time in the two years  and eight months of the unit's campaign in France and Belgium.    [C] _See_ Appendix G.

The riding horses, transport wagons, and heavy baggage, having been sent  to Fremantle the previous day, shortly after noon on the 9th June the  Battalion proceeded in two trains to the port. Although officially the  date and hour of departure had not been disclosed, certain indications  had conveyed that information to the public. The consequence was a  series of demonstrations along the route. The engines in the railway  yards made loud and prolonged noises in imitation of barnyard  inhabitants, flags and handkerchiefs were waved, and many cheers given  to speed the Battalion on its way. On Victoria Quay was a large  concourse of people for the purpose of bidding farewell to relatives and  friends. This somewhat interfered with the embarkation, but by 4.30 p.m.  the last man and horse and the last piece of impedimenta were on board.  The District Commandant personally superintended the operation. He was  accompanied by the Chaplain-General, the Most Rev. Dr. Riley, Archbishop  of Perth, whose kindly and encouraging words gave great heart to those  setting out on so serious a task. In a letter to the Commanding Officer  he had written--\"Will you tell your officers and men how proud I have  been of their conduct in camp and how we all trust the honour and  reputation of W.A. in their hands with the utmost confidence. Good-bye  to you all, a safe journey, valiant work, and a speedy return crowned  with victory.\"    About 5.30 p.m. the transport left the quay and moved towards Gage  Roads. Although the evening meal had been arranged for on the troop  decks, very few attended. Nearly all desired to wave a last good-bye to  those they were leaving behind and to catch a parting glimpse of the  land they might never see again. Gage Roads was reached and darkness  coming down shut out the last view of Australia. Here final matters in  connection with the records and pay of the troops were arranged, the  embarkation and pay staffs left the ship, the engine bells rang, and the  long voyage began.    The transport was the S.S. \"Ascanius,\" known officially as the  \"A11,\" a steel twin-screw vessel of the Blue Funnel Line, built in 1910,  and with a registered tonnage of 10,048. She had a length and breadth of  493 feet and 60 feet, respectively, and was fitted with three decks.  The two lower decks were divided into areas and a certain number of  tables and forms were placed in each area. Each table accommodated a  mess of a number varying from 12 to 22 men. Before leaving Blackboy Hill  the troops had been divided into messes corresponding to the ship's  equivalent space. Consequently, on arriving at the top of the gangway  when embarking, each party was met by a guide and taken direct to its  quarters. Hammocks, blankets, and eating utensils were issued forthwith  and they were shown where to stack their rifles and kits. Also,  instruction was given as to the measures necessary to prevent fire or an  outbreak of disease. Later on, when the decks were cleared, boat  stations were pointed out, boats' crews detailed, and collision-fire  measures practised. The promenade and boat decks were kept free for  recreation and instructional work. The after well-deck held the horse  shelters and an auxiliary kitchen. Under the fo'c'sle head was the main  kitchen. Situated on the poop deck was a small isolation hospital. A  separate mess and quarters received the warrant officers and sergeants;  whilst the officers were allotted what had once been the accommodation  for passengers.    The ship had commenced its journey at Brisbane, and on arrival at  Fremantle already carried the two Queensland companies of the 26th  Battalion (Majors F. M. O'Donnell and P. Currie), the 17th Company  A.A.S.C. (Captain A. E. Harte), and a portion of the 7th Field Ambulance  (Lt.-Col. R. B. Huxtable, V.D.). At the W.A. port the Brigade Commander  and the Staff-Captain embarked. Altogether, with the western unit, some  1,750 of all ranks were now leaving Australia.    Here it may not be out of place to mention that certain statistics  concerning the 28th Battalion, collected during the voyage, showed that  approximately 50 per cent. of the officers and other ranks were  Australian born. The other moiety was composed almost wholly of natives  of the British Isles. A Russian, a Maltese, a Scandinavian or two, and a  few others, were the only exceptions. The average age was in the  vicinity of 24 years and only 143 married men could be counted. The  recruiting area had been extensive and those enlisted included the  professional and business man, the artisan, clerk, shop assistant, and  labourer from the metropolis; the shearer, drover, and pearler from the  north-west and far north; the farmer from the eastern and south-western  districts; the timber worker; and the miner and prospector from the  goldfields. In all some 150 civil occupations were represented, the  principal ones being as follows:--Labourers 199, farmers and farm hands  109, miners and prospectors 70, timber workers 64, clerks 60,  carpenters and joiners 27, horse drivers 18, pearlers 17, grocers 16,  engineers 13, and butchers 13.    [Illustration: THE FAREWELL AT FREMANTLE.  9th June, 1915.  _Photos. lent by Mr. E. L. Mitchell, Perth'_]    For the first two or three days of the voyage the rather choppy sea and  consequent motion of the boat caused some sickness. This prevented close  supervision and the adoption of strict routine at the outset and laid  much extra work and worry on those who had good sea legs. However, about  the third day out very few were absent from meals, the ship was becoming  known, and it was found possible to put into execution plans for  training, exercise, and amusement. The deck space was so used that each  unit had definite periods and places on it. Sufficient room to work all  the troops at the one time was not available, but by the methods adopted  every man got at least three hours' active training daily. The utmost  use had to be made of the opportunities afforded. For the purposes of  training, the time spent at Blackboy Hill had been all too short. So  much still remained to be taught and to be learned; also, the period for  acquiring knowledge that would be allowed at the other end could only be  conjectured--in any event it was likely to be of short duration. Stress,  therefore, was laid, firstly, on keeping the physical exercises going  and, secondly, on continuing the instruction in musketry, and getting  the soldier more and more used to the rifle as his main weapon of  offence and defence. Theoretical instruction was given on half a hundred  subjects ranging from the hygiene of the person to the role supposed to  be played by the cavalry and artillery in a general action. All ranks  were quick at assimilating knowledge. Perhaps the best results were  obtained during the informal talks which took place between officers and  men in the \"sit easy\" periods. The specialists were given opportunities  for paying greater attention to their own peculiar work, and in this, in  particular, the signallers made great strides. Machine gunners had  facilities for practice at floating targets, which targets were also  used for revolver firing.    The Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers had longer hours. After  parades were dismissed they were often required to attend lectures  dealing with the functions of subordinate leaders. Officers, as a rule,  had a very full day. The personal attention demanded from them in  respect to all matters affecting the welfare of their platoons or  companies, the supervision of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#6)"],[1," did. Thinking this  a safe conduct sent to them by Providence, they took courage and  travelled in the daytime in company with the lion. The horsemen who had  been sent in pursuit came up, and would have seized upon them, but the  lion interposed, and they were allowed to pass on. Every day these poor  slaves met with some one or other person who wanted to seize them, but  the lion was their protector until they reached the sea coast in safety,  when he left them.    [Illustration]          XXXVIII    THE DOG AND THE GOOSE      A goose was once observed to attach itself in the strongest and most  affectionate manner to the house dog, but never offered to go into the  kennel except in rainy weather. Whenever the dog barked, the goose would  cackle, and run at the person she supposed the dog barked at, and try to  bite him by the heels. She would sometimes try to feed with the dog, but  this the dog, who treated his faithful companion with indifference,  would not allow. This bird would not go to roost with the others at  night, unless she was driven by main force; and when in the morning they  were all turned into the field, she would never stir from the yard gate,  but sit there the whole day in sight of the dog. At length orders were  given that she should not longer be molested. Being thus left to  herself, she ran about the yard with him all night and what is most  strange, whenever the dog went out of the yard and ran into the village,  the goose always went with him, managing to keep up with him by the help  of her wings, and thus running and flying, followed him all over the  town. This strange affection of the goose for the dog, which continued  till his death, two years after it was first noticed, is supposed to  have been due to the fact, that once, in her very young days, he had  saved her from a fox.    [Illustration]    While the dog was ill, the goose never left him, day or night, not even  to feed, and she would surely have starved to death had not a pan of  corn been set every day close to the kennel. At this time the goose  generally sat in the kennel, and would not allow any one to come near  it, except the person who brought the dog's or her own food. The end of  this faithful bird was very sad; for when the dog died, she would still  keep possession of the kennel. A new house dog was bought, which in size  and color so resembled the one lately lost that the poor goose was  unhappily deceived, and going into the kennel as usual, the new dog  seized her by the throat and killed her.          XXXIX    THE DEATH OF ANTIOCHUS REVENGED      When Antiochus was killed in battle by Centaretrius the Galatian, the  victor exultingly leaped on the back of the fallen king's horse; but he  had no sooner done so, than the animal, as if sensible that it was  bestridden by the slayer of its master, at once showed signs of the  greatest fury, and bounding forward to the top of a lofty rock, with a  speed which defied every attempt of Centaretrius to disengage himself,  leaped with him over the precipice, at the foot of which both were found  dashed to pieces. Thus did the noble horse revenge his master's death.    [Illustration]          XL    A NOBLE REVENGE      A young man, anxious to get rid of his dog, took it along with him to  the river. He hired a boat, and rowing out into the stream, threw the  animal in. The poor creature tried to climb up the sides of the boat,  but his master, whose wish was to drown him, kept on pushing him back  into the water with the oar. In doing this, he fell into the water  himself, and would certainly have been drowned, had not the dog, as soon  as he saw his master struggling helplessly in the stream, allowed the  boat to float away, seized his master's coat, and held him above water  till help came, and his life was saved.    [Illustration]          XLI    LONG LOST FOUND AGAIN      A female elephant belonging to a gentleman in Calcutta broke loose from  her keeper, and was lost in the woods. The excuses which the keeper made  were not admitted. It was supposed that he had sold the elephant; his  wife and family therefore were sold for slaves, and he himself was  condemned to work upon the roads.    About twelve years after, this man was ordered into the country to  assist in catching wild elephants. The keeper fancied he saw his  long-lost elephant in a group that was before them. He was determined to  go up to it; nor could the strongest arguments as to the danger of such  a risk keep him from his purpose. When he came near the creature, she  knew him, and giving him three salutes by waving her trunk in the air,  knelt down and received him on her back. She afterwards helped in  securing the other elephants, and likewise brought her three young ones.  The keeper recovered his reputation; and, as a recompense for his  sufferings and bravery, had a certain sum of money settled on him for  life.    [Illustration]          XLII    THE DOG OF MONTARGIS      A Frenchman of family and fortune, travelling alone through a forest,  was murdered and buried under a tree. His dog, an English bloodhound,  would not leave his master's grave till at length, compelled by hunger,  he went to the house of a friend of his master's, and by his mournful  howling seemed trying to make him know that something had happened. He  repeated his cries, ran to the door, looked back to see if any one  followed him, went back to his master's friend, pulled him by the  sleeve, and with a great deal of earnestness seemed begging him to  follow.    Struck by these actions, the company decided to follow the dog, who led  them to a tree where he began scratching the earth and howling. On  digging, the body of the unhappy man was found.    Some time after, the dog accidentaly met the murderer, instantly seized  him by the throat, and was with the greatest difficulty compelled to  loose his hold. As the dog continued to follow and attack the man,  though kind and gentle to all others, his actions began to attract  notice and comment.    At last the affair reached the king's ear. He sent for the dog, who  seemed very gentle till he saw the murderer, when he ran at him  fiercely, growling and snapping at him as usual.    [Illustration]    The king, struck with the strange behavior of the noble animal, decided  to refer the decision to the chance of battle. In other words, he gave  orders for a combat between the assassin and the dog. The lists were  appointed, and the man was allowed for his weapon a great cudgel.    An empty cask was given to the dog as a place of retreat, to give him a  chance to recover his breath. The dog, finding himself at liberty ran  round his adversary, avoiding his blows, and threatening him on every  side, till his strength was exhausted; then springing forward, he  gripped him by the throat, threw him on the ground, and made him confess  before the king and the whole court. The assassin was afterward  convicted and beheaded.          XLIII    CRAB FISHING      The following is an instance of the wonderful cunning shown by the  Raccoon. It is very fond of crabs, and when in quest of them, will stand  by the side of a swamp, and hang its tail over into the water. The  crabs, mistaking the tail for food, are sure to lay hold of it; and as  soon as the sly beast feels them pinch, he pulls them out with a sudden  jerk. He then takes them to a little distance from the water's edge, and  in eating them, is careful to get them crossways in his mouth, lest he  should suffer from their nippers.    [Illustration]          XLIV    THE HORSE AND GREYHOUND      Various have been the opinions upon the difference of speed between a  well-bred greyhound and a racehorse, if opposed to each other. Wishes  had been often expressed by the sporting world that some standard could  be adopted by which the superiority of speed could be fairly  ascertained, when the following incident happened, and afforded some  information upon what had before been considered a matter of great  uncertainty. In the month of December, 1800 a match was to have been run  over Doncaster racecourse for one hundred guineas, but one of the horses  being withdrawn, a mare started alone, that by running the ground she  might ensure the wager. After having run about a mile in the four, she  was joined by a greyhound, which leaped into the course from one side,  and entering into the competition, continued to race with the mare for  the other three miles, keeping nearly head and head, and affording an  excellent treat to the field by the energetic exertions of each. At  passing the distance post five to four was bet in favor of the  greyhound; when parallel with the stand it was even betting, and any  person might have taken his choice from five to ten. The mare, however,  had the advantage by a head at the end of the race.    [Illustration]          XLV    THE WATCH DOG      A thief who had broken into the shop of Cellini, the artist, and was  breaking open the caskets in order to get at some jewels, was arrested  in his progress by a dog, against whom he found it a difficult matter to  defend himself with a sword. The faithful animal ran to the room where  the journeymen slept, but as they did not seem to hear him barking, he  drew away the bed-clothes, and pulling them alternately by the arms,  forcibly woke them; then barking very loud, he showed the way to the  thief, and went on before; but the men would not follow him, and at last  they locked their door. The dog, having lost all hopes of the assistance  of these men, undertook the task alone, and ran downstairs. He could not  find the villain in the shop, but instantly rushing into the street came  up with him, and tearing off his cloak, would have treated him according  to his deserts if the fellow had not called to some tailors in the  neighborhood, and begged them to help him. They came to his aid, and  drove the poor animal away.    [Illustration]          XLVI    THE"]]]
