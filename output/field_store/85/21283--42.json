When he saw Paul  he started and a strange, vivid, exultant expression flashed across  his face.    Paul felt a sudden chill--the upspringing fountain of his gladness was  checked in mid-leap. He had known no doubt on the way home--all that  long, weary walk he had known no doubt--but now?    \"Stephen,\" he cried. \"I've come back! I had to! Stephen, are you  glad--are you glad?\"    Stephen's face was as emotionless as ever. The burst of feeling which  had frightened Paul by its unaccustomedness had passed like a fleeting  outbreak of sunshine between dull clouds.    \"I reckon I am,\" he said. \"Yes, I reckon I am. I kind of--hoped--you  would come back. You'd better go in and get some breakfast.\"    Paul's eyes were as radiant as the deepening dawn. He knew Stephen was  glad and he knew there was nothing more to be said about it. They were  back just where they were before Miss Trevor came--back in their  perfect, unmarred, sufficient comradeship.    \"I must just run around and see Nora first,\" said Paul.          Abel and His Great Adventure      \"Come out of doors, master--come out of doors. I can't talk or think  right with walls around me--never could. Let's go out to the garden.\"  These were almost the first words I ever heard Abel Armstrong say. He  was a member of the board of school trustees in Stillwater, and I had  not met him before this late May evening, when I had gone down to  confer with him upon some small matter of business. For I was \"the new  schoolmaster\" in Stillwater, having taken the school for the summer  term.    It was a rather lonely country district--a fact of which I was glad,  for life had been going somewhat awry with me and my heart was sore  and rebellious over many things that have nothing to do with this  narration. Stillwater offered time and opportunity for healing and  counsel. Yet, looking back, I doubt if I should have found either had  it not been for Abel and his beloved garden.    Abel Armstrong (he was always called \"Old Abel\", though he was barely  sixty) lived in a quaint, gray house close by the harbour shore. I  heard a good deal about him before I saw him. He was called \"queer\",  but Stillwater folks seemed to be very fond of him. He and his sister,  Tamzine, lived together; she, so my garrulous landlady informed me,  had not been sound of mind at times for many years; but she was all  right now, only odd and quiet. Abel had gone to college for a year  when he was young, but had given it up when Tamzine \"went crazy\".  There was no one else to look after her. Abel had settled down to it  with apparent content: at least he had never complained.    \"Always took things easy, Abel did,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"Never  seemed to worry over disappointments and trials as most folks do.  Seems to me that as long as Abel Armstrong can stride up and down in  that garden of his, reciting poetry and speeches, or talking to that  yaller cat of his as if it was a human, he doesn't care much how the  world wags on. He never had much git-up-and-git. His father was a  hustler, but the family didn't take after him. They all favoured the  mother's people--sorter shiftless and dreamy. 'Taint the way to git on  in this world.\"    No, good and worthy Mrs. Campbell. It was not the way to get on in  your world; but there are other worlds where getting on is estimated  by different standards, and Abel Armstrong lived in one of these--a  world far beyond the ken of the thrifty Stillwater farmers and  fishers. Something of this I had sensed, even before I saw him; and  that night in his garden, under a sky of smoky red, blossoming into  stars above the harbour, I found a friend whose personality and  philosophy were to calm and harmonize and enrich my whole existence.  This sketch is my grateful tribute to one of the rarest and finest  souls God ever clothed with clay.    He was a tall man, somewhat ungainly of figure and homely of face. But  his large, deep eyes of velvety nut-brown were very beautiful and  marvellously bright and clear for a man of his age. He wore a little  pointed, well-cared-for beard, innocent of gray; but his hair was  grizzled, and altogether he had the appearance of a man who had passed  through many sorrows which had marked his body as well as his soul.  Looking at him, I doubted Mrs. Campbell's conclusion that he had not  \"minded\" giving up college. This man had given up much and felt it  deeply; but he had outlived the pain and the blessing of sacrifice had  come to him. His voice was very melodious and beautiful, and the brown  hand he held out to me was peculiarly long and shapely and flexible.    We went out to the garden in the scented moist air of a maritime  spring evening. Behind the garden was a cloudy pine wood; the house  closed it in on the left, while in front and on the right a row of  tall Lombardy poplars stood out in stately purple silhouette against  the sunset sky.    \"Always liked Lombardies,\" said Abel, waving a long arm at them. \"They  are the trees of princesses. When I was a boy they were fashionable.  Anyone who had any pretensions to gentility had a row of Lombardies at  the foot of his lawn or up his lane, or at any rate one on either side  of his front door. They're out of fashion now. Folks complain they die  at the top and get ragged-looking. So they do--so they do, if you  don't risk your neck every spring climbing up a light ladder to trim  them out as I do. My neck isn't worth much to anyone, which, I  suppose, is why I've never broken it; and _my_ Lombardies never look  out-at-elbows. My mother was especially fond of them. She liked their  dignity and their stand-offishness. _They_ don't hobnob with every  Tom, Dick and Harry. If it's pines for company, master, it's  Lombardies for society.\"    We stepped from the front doorstone into the garden. There was another  entrance--a sagging gate flanked by two branching white lilacs. From  it a little dappled path led to a huge apple-tree in the centre, a  great swelling cone of rosy blossom with a mossy circular seat around  its trunk. But Abel's favourite seat, so he told me, was lower down  the slope, under a little trellis overhung with the delicate emerald  of young hop-vines. He led me to it and pointed proudly to the fine  view of the harbour visible from it. The early sunset glow of rose and  flame had faded out of the sky; the water was silvery and mirror-like;  dim sails drifted along by the darkening shore. A bell was ringing in  a small Catholic chapel across the harbour. Mellowly and dreamily  sweet the chime floated through the dusk, blent with the moan of the  sea. The great revolving light at the channel trembled and flashed  against the opal sky, and far out, beyond the golden sand-dunes of the  bar, was the crinkled gray ribbon of a passing steamer's smoke.    \"There, isn't that view worth looking at?\" said old Abel, with a  loving, proprietary pride. \"You don't have to pay anything for it,  either. All that sea and sky free--'without money and without price'.  Let's sit down here in the hop-vine arbour, master. There'll be a  moonrise presently. I'm never tired of finding out what a moonrise  sheen can be like over that sea. There's a surprise in it every time.  Now, master, you're getting your mouth in the proper shape to talk  business--but don't you do it. Nobody should talk business when he's  expecting a moonrise. Not that I like talking business at any time.\"    \"Unfortunately it has to be talked of sometimes, Mr. Armstrong,\" I  said.    \"Yes, it seems to be a necessary evil, master,\" he acknowledged. \"But  I know what business you've come upon, and we can settle it in five  minutes after the moon's well up. I'll just agree to everything you  and the other two trustees want. Lord knows why they ever put me on  the school board. Maybe it's because I'm so ornamental. They wanted  one good-looking man, I reckon.\"    His low chuckle, so full of mirth and so free from malice, was  infectious. I laughed also, as I sat down in the hop-vine arbour.    \"Now, you needn't talk if you don't want to,\" he said. \"And I won't.  We'll just sit here, sociable like, and if we think of anything worth  while to say we'll say it. Otherwise, not. If you can sit in silence  with a person for half an hour and feel comfortable, you and that  person can be friends. If you can't, friends you'll never be, and you  needn't waste time in trying.\"    Abel and I passed successfully the test of silence that evening in the  hop-vine arbour. I was strangely content to sit and think--something I  had not cared to do lately. A peace, long unknown to my stormy soul,  seemed hovering near it. The garden was steeped in it; old Abel's  personality radiated it. I looked about me and wondered whence came  the charm of that tangled, unworldly spot.    \"Nice and far from the market-place isn't it?\" asked Abel suddenly,  as if he had heard my unasked question. \"No buying and selling and  getting gain here. Nothing was ever sold out of _this_ garden. Tamzine  has her vegetable plot over yonder, but what we don't eat we give  away. Geordie Marr down the harbour has a big garden like this and he  sells heaps of flowers and fruit and vegetables to the hotel folks. He  thinks I'm an awful fool because I won't do the same. Well, he gets  money out of his garden and I get happiness out of mine. That's the  difference. S'posing I could make more money--what then? I'd only be  taking it from people that needed it more. There's enough for Tamzine  and me. As for Geordie Marr, there isn't a more unhappy creature on  God's earth--he's always stewing in a broth of trouble, poor man. O'  course, he brews up most of it for himself, but I reckon that doesn't  make it any easier to bear. Ever sit in a hop-vine arbour before,  master?\"    I was to grow used to Abel's abrupt change of subject. I answered that  I never had.    \"Great place for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24884"],[0,"Commercial Geography (#6)"],[1,"of rainfall is even a greater factor in restricting the  density of population than too much rain. With less than fifteen or  twenty inches a year few regions produce good crops of grains and  grasses, and as a result they are sparsely peopled. Some of the  exceptions, however, are important. If the rainfall is not quite enough  to produce a normal overflow to the sea, the soil may be very rich,  because the nutrition is not leached out and carried away.    Many small areas of this character produce enormous crops when  artificially watered, and many of them, such as Persia, parts of Asia  Minor, northern Utah, and large areas of Australia and Chile have become  regions of considerable commercial importance. The products of such  regions are apt to be unique in character and of unusual value. Thus,  the wool of Persia and Australia and the fruit of the Iberian peninsula  are important articles of commerce.    In Egypt one may see the results of irrigated lands. The area of  geographical Egypt is somewhat less than half a million square miles;  the habitable part of the country is confined to a narrow strip, which,  one or two places excepted, varies from three to six miles in width. In  other words, almost the whole population of the country is massed in the  flood-plain and delta of the Nile; the remaining part is a desert  producing practically nothing.    The water that makes these lands productive falls, not in Egypt, but in  the highlands of Abyssinia, 2,000 miles away. The September overflow of  the flood-plain is the chief factor in the irrigation of these lands,  but the area has been greatly increased by the construction of barrages  and dams at Assiut and Assuan.    In the western highland region of the United States considerable areas  already have been made productive by irrigation, and it is estimated  that about two million acres of barren land can be reclaimed by  impounding the waters of the various streams now running to waste.    The distribution of rain with respect to the season in which it falls is  quite as important as its distribution with respect to quantity. In  tropical regions the ocean winds, and therefore the rainfall, come from  the east. The eastern slopes of such regions, therefore, have a season  in which rains may be expected daily, and another in which no rain falls  for several months. In the temperate zones seasonal rains for a similar  reason are on the western coasts.    Thus on the Pacific coast of the United States the rainfall varies from  about one hundred inches in southern Alaska to about twelve in San  Diego, Cal. Practically all the rain falls between October and the  following May; very little or none falls in the interval between May and  October. As a result, ordinary turf-grass, which will not withstand long  droughts, grows in only a few localities of the Pacific slope. It is  replaced by hardier grasses whose roots, instead of forming turf, grow  very deep in the soil.    Common clover will not grow in this region unless irrigated; it is  replaced by burr-clover, a variety of the plant that will not thrive in  moist regions. Now the quality of the merino wool clip of California  depends in no slight degree upon the burr-clover and other food-products  that thrive in regions of seasonal rains; that is, a great commercial  industry exists because of this feature of rainfall, and it could not  long survive in spite of it.    [Illustration: CLIMATICALLY ADAPTED TO CULTIVATION--THE LOWLANDS  PRODUCE BREAD-STUFFS AND FRUIT; THE MOUNTAIN-SLOPES ARE GRAZING REGIONS]    The seasonal rainfall also affects other agricultural industries. The  sacked wheat-crop may be left in the field without cover or protection  until the time is convenient for shipping it. The absence of summer  rains makes possible in California what would be out of question in the  Mississippi Valley, where a rainstorm may be expected every few days.    The quality of certain fruits depends largely on the season during which  the rainfall occurs. Apples, pears, and grapes grown in regions having  dry summers have usually a very superior flavor. The raisin-making  industry of California also depends on the same condition, because, in  order to insure a good quality of the product, the bunches of grapes,  after picking, must be dried on the ground. To a certain extent this is  also true of other fruits, such as dates, figs, and prunes, which  frequently are sun-dried.    The presence of large bodies of water, which both absorb and give out  their heat very slowly, tempers the climate of the nearby land and to  that extent modifies the commerce of such districts. The grape-growing  industry of central New York is a great one and its product is famous.  Its existence depends almost wholly upon the lake-tempered climate.  Elsewhere in the State the industry is on a precarious basis, and the  product is inferior.    =Effects of Inclination of the Earth's Axis.=--The inclination and  self-parallelism of the earth's axis is undoubtedly a very important  factor in climate. Practically it more than doubles the width of the  belts of ordinary food-stuffs by lengthening the summer day in the  temperate zone. Beyond the tropics the obliquity of the sun's rays are  more than balanced by the increased length of time in which they fall.    Thus, in the latitude of St. Paul, the longest day is about fifteen and  one-half hours long; at Liverpool it is nearly seventeen hours long; a  greater number of heat units therefore are received in these latitudes  during summer than are received in equatorial regions during the  twelve-hour day. Moreover, the summer temperature is higher in these  latitudes than in the torrid zone, because the sun is shining upon them  for a greater length of time.    The result of these various influences is far-reaching. Because of the  long summer days and short nights, wheat can be cultivated to the  sixtieth parallel. Corn, which gets scarcely enough warmth and light in  the torrid zone to become a prolific crop, attains its greatest yield in  the latitude of fourteen-hour days.    These factors, it is evident, carry the grain and meat industries into  regions that otherwise would not be habitable. Because the long summer  days produce these great food-crops, commerce and its allied industries  have reached their maximum development in these regions. Human  activities are greatest in the zones bounded by the thirty-fifth and  fifty-fifth parallels, the zone that includes the greater parts of the  United States, Europe, China, Japan. They are greatest, moreover,  because of their geographical position.      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    What would be the probable effect on the food-crops of the United States  were the main body of the country moved twenty degrees north in  latitude? Which would then be the wheat-growing States, the  cotton-producing States?    Illustrate the connection between occupation and altitude above  sea-level.    What difference would it make to the corn-crop were the days and nights  always twelve hours long?    What would be requisite to make Canada a centre of silk production?    Why is not cod-fishing an industry off the east coast of Florida?    Why is the greater part of the Russian Empire destined to be sparsely  peopled?

CHAPTER V    TRANSPORTATION--OCEAN AND INLAND NAVIGATION      Of all the adjustments which come into the lives of a people none has  been so far-reaching as the gradual localization of industries each in  the region best adapted to it. For instance, manufacturing industries  require power, but not fertile soil; therefore the manufacturing  industries seek nearness to fuel or to water-power, and a position  available for quick transportation.    Farming does not require any great amount of natural power; on the  contrary, level land having a great depth of fertile soil is the  essential feature. The farmer must therefore look first of all to  conditions of topography and climate, and secondly to the means of  transporting his crop.    Mining cannot be an industry in regions destitute of minerals; the miner  must therefore go where the mineral wealth is found, without regard to  climate, soil, centres of population, or topography. But two things are  required--the mineral products and the means of getting them to the  people--that is, ready means of transportation.    A century or more ago, each centre of population in the United States  was practically self-sustaining. Each grew its own food-stuffs, and  manufactured the articles used in the household. But very little was  required in the way of transportation. The means of carriage were mainly  ox-carts, pack-horses, and rafts. There was a mutual independence among  the various centres, it is true, but the independence was at the expense  of civilization and the comforts of life.    [Illustration: OCEAN TRANSPORTATION--ROYAL MAIL STEAMSHIP OCEANIC,  WHITE STAR LINE]    Beyond an independence that is more apparent than real, such a plan of  social and industrial organization has but little in it to commend.  Intercommunication increases knowledge, and under the conditions that  formerly prevailed, there was a lack of the breadth of knowledge that  comes with the mutual contact of peoples.    The utilization of national resources, such as the productiveness of the  land, the existence of iron ore, coal, copper, and other economic  minerals, finally brought about the policy of a territorial division of  industries. This, in turn, made the prompt transportation and exchange  of commodities essential; indeed, without such a plan, industrial  centres could not long exist.    The man whose sole business is manufacture must look to others for his  supply of food-stuffs and raw materials, and these are produced more  economically at a distance from the centre of manufacture.
