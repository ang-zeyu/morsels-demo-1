[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26598"],[0,"Seasoning of Wood (#6)"],[1,"Cedar= (_Chamaecyparis Lawsoniana_) (Port Orford Cedar, Oregon  Cedar, Lawson's Cypress, Ginger Pine). A very large tree. A fine,  close-grained, yellowish-white, durable timber, elastic, easily  worked, free of knots, and fragrant. Extensively cut for lumber;  heavier and stronger than any of the preceding. Along the coast line  of Oregon.    =5. White Cedar= (_Libocedrus decurrens_) (Incense Cedar). A large tree,  abundantly scattered among pine and fir. Wood fine-grained. Cascades  and Sierra Nevada Mountains of Oregon and California.    =6. Yellow Cedar= (_Cupressus nootkatensis_) (Alaska Cedar, Alaska  Cypress). A very large tree, much used for panelling and furniture. A  fine, close-grained, yellowish white, durable timber, easily worked.  Along the coast line of Oregon north.                                 (_b_) Red Cedars    =7. Red Cedar= (_Juniperus Virginiana_) (Savin Juniper, Juniper, Red  Juniper, Juniper Bush, Pencil Cedar). Heartwood dull red color, thin  sapwood nearly white. Close even grain, compact structure. Wood light,  soft, weak, brittle, easily worked, durable in contact with the soil,  and fragrant. Used for ties, posts, interior finish, pencil cases,  cigar boxes, silos, tanks, and especially for lead pencils, for which  purpose alone several million feet are cut each year. A small to  medium-sized tree scattered through the forests, or in the West  sparsely covering extensive areas (cedar brakes). The red cedar is the  most widely distributed conifer of the United States, occurring from  the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Florida to Minnesota. Attains a  suitable size for lumber only in the Southern, and more especially the  Gulf States.    =8. Red Cedar= (_Juniperus communis_) (Ground Cedar). Small-sized tree,  its maximum height being about 25 feet. It is found widely distributed  throughout the Northern hemisphere. Wood in its quality similar to the  preceding. The fruit of this species is gathered in large quantities  and used in the manufacture of gin; whose peculiar flavor and  medicinal properties are due to the oil of Juniper berries, which is  secured by adding the crushed fruit to undistilled grain spirit, or by  allowing the vapor to pass over it before condensation. Used locally  for construction purposes, fence posts, etc. Ranges from Greenland to  Alaska, in the East, southward to Pennsylvania and northern Nebraska;  in the Rocky Mountains to Texas, Mexico, and Arizona.    =9. Redwood= (_Sequoia sempervirens_) (Sequoia, California Redwood,  Coast Redwood). Wood in its quality and uses like white cedar. Thick,  red heartwood, changing to reddish brown when seasoned. Thin sapwood,  nearly white, coarse, straight grain, compact structure. Light, not  strong, soft, very durable in contact with the soil, not resinous,  easily worked, does not burn easily, receives high polish. Used for  timber, shingles, flumes, fence posts, coffins, railway ties, water  pipes, interior decorations, and cabinetmaking. A very large tree,  limited to the coast ranges of California, and forming considerable  forests, which are rapidly being converted into lumber.                                      CYPRESS    =10. Cypress= (_Taxodium distinchum_) (Bald Cypress, Black, White, and  Red Cypress, Pecky Cypress). Wood in its appearance, quality, and uses  similar to white cedar. \"Black\" and \"White Cypress\" are heavy and  light forms of the same species. Heartwood brownish; sapwood nearly  white. Wood close, straight-grain, frequently full of small holes  caused by disease known as \"pecky cypress.\" Greasy appearance and  feeling. Wood light, soft, not strong, durable in contact with the  soil, takes a fine polish. Green wood often very heavy. Used for  carpentry, building construction, shingles, cooperage, railway ties,  silos, tanks, vehicles, and washing machines. The cypress is a large,  deciduous tree, inhabiting swampy lands, and along rivers and coasts  of the Southern parts of the United States. Grows to a height of 150  feet and 12 feet in diameter.                                        FIR    This name is frequently applied to wood and to trees which are not  fir; most commonly to spruce, but also, especially in English markets,  to pine. It resembles spruce, but is easily distinguished from it, as  well as from pine and larch, by the absence of resin ducts. Quality,  uses, and habits similar to spruce.    =11. Balsam Fir= (_Abies balsamea_) (Balsam, Fir Tree, Balm of Gilead  Fir). Heartwood white to brownish; sapwood lighter color;  coarse-grained, compact structure, satiny. Wood light, not durable or  strong, resinous, easily split. Used for boxes, crates, doors,  millwork, cheap lumber, paper pulp. Inferior to white pine or spruce,  yet often mixed and sold with these species in the lumber market. A  medium-sized tree scattered throughout the northern pineries, and cut  in lumber operations whenever of sufficient size. Minnesota to Maine  and northward.    =12. White Fir= (_Abies grandis_ and _Abies concolor_). Medium-to very  large-sized tree, forming an important part of most of the Western  mountain forests, and furnishes much of the lumber of the respective  regions. The former occurs from Vancouver to California, and the  latter from Oregon to Arizona and eastward to Colorado and Mexico. The  wood is soft and light, coarse-grained, not unlike the \"Swiss pine\" of  Europe, but darker and firmer, and is not suitable for any purpose  requiring strength. It is used for boxes, barrels, and to a small  extent for wood pulp.    =13. White Fir= (_Abies amabalis_). Good-sized tree, often forming  extensive mountain forests. Wood similar in quality and uses to _Abies  grandis_. Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon.    =14. Red Fir= (_Abies nobilis_) (Noble Fir) (not to be confounded with  Douglas spruce. See No. 40). Large to very large-sized tree, forming  extensive forests on the slope of the mountains between 3,000 and  4,000 feet elevation. Cascade Mountains of Oregon.    =15. Red Fir= (_Abies magnifica_). Very large-sized tree, forming  forests about the base of Mount Shasta. Sierra Nevada Mountains of  California, from Mount Shasta southward.                                      HEMLOCK    Light to medium weight, soft, stiff, but brittle, commonly  cross-grained, rough and splintery. Sapwood and heartwood not well  defined. The wood of a light reddish-gray color, free from resin  ducts, moderately durable, shrinks and warps considerably in drying,  wears rough, retains nails firmly. Used principally for dimension  stuff and timbers. Hemlocks are medium- to large-sized trees, commonly  scattered among broad-leaved trees and conifers, but often forming  forests of almost pure growth.    =16. Hemlock= (_Tsuga canadensis_) (Hemlock Spruce, Peruche).  Medium-sized tree, furnishes almost all the hemlock of the Eastern  market. Maine to Wisconsin, also following the Alleghanies southward  to Georgia and Alabama.    =17. Hemlock= (_Tsuga mertensiana_). Large-sized tree, wood claimed to  be heavier and harder than the Eastern species and of superior  quality. Used for pulp wood, floors, panels, and newels. It is not  suitable for heavy construction, especially where exposed to the  weather, it is straight in grain and will take a good polish. Not  adapted for use partly in and partly out of the ground; in fresh water  as piles will last about ten years, but as it is softer than fir it is  less able to stand driving successfully. Washington to California and  eastward to Montana.                                 LARCH or TAMARACK    Wood like the best of hard pine both in appearance, quality, and uses,  and owing to its great durability somewhat preferred in shipbuilding,  for telegraph poles, and railway ties. In its structure it resembles  spruce. The larches are deciduous trees, occasionally covering  considerable areas, but usually scattered among other conifers.    =18. Tamarack= (_Larix laricina_ var. _Americana_) (Larch, Black Larch,  American Larch, Hacmatac). Heartwood light brown in color, sapwood  nearly white, coarse conspicuous grain, compact structure, annual  rings pronounced. Wood heavy, hard, very strong, durable in contact  with the soil. Used for railway ties, fence posts, sills, ship  timbers, telegraph poles, flagstaffs. Medium-sized tree, often  covering swamps, in which case it is smaller and of poor quality.  Maine to Minnesota, and southward to Pennsylvania.    =19. Tamarack= (_Larix occidentalis_) (Western Larch, Larch).  Large-sized trees, scattered, locally abundant. Is little inferior to  oak in strength and durability. Heartwood of a light brown color with  lighter sapwood, has a fine, slightly satiny grain, and is fairly free  from knots; the annual rings are distant. Used for railway ties and  shipbuilding. Washington and Oregon to Montana.                                       PINE    Very variable, very light and soft in \"soft\" pine, such as white pine;  of medium weight to heavy and quite hard in \"hard\" pine, of which the  long-leaf or Georgia pine is the extreme form. Usually it is stiff,  quite strong, of even texture, and more or less resinous. The sapwood  is yellowish white; the heartwood orange brown. Pine shrinks  moderately, seasons rapidly and without much injury; it works easily,  is never too hard to nail (unlike oak or hickory); it is mostly quite  durable when in contact with the soil, and if well seasoned is not  subject to the attacks of boring insects. The heavier the wood, the  darker, stronger, and harder it is, and the more it shrinks and checks  when seasoning. Pine is used more extensively than any other wood. It  is the principal wood in carpentry, as well as in all heavy  construction, bridges, trestles, etc. It is also used in almost every  other wood industry; for spars, masts, planks, and timbers in  shipbuilding, in car and wagon construction, in cooperage and  woodenware; for crates and boxes, in furniture work, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26600"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 1, March 1906 (#6)"],[1,"men that are free, well-born, well-bred, and conversant in  honest companies, have naturally an instinct and spur that prompteth  them unto virtuous actions, and withdraws them from vice, which is  called honor. Those same men, when by base subjection and constraint  they are brought under and kept down, turn aside from that noble  disposition, by which they formerly were inclined to virtue, to shake  off that bond of servitude, wherein they are so tyrannously enslaved;  for it is agreeable to the nature of man to long after things forbidden,  and to desire what is denied us. By this liberty they entered into a  very laudable emulation, to do all of them what they saw did please one.  If any of the gallants or ladies should say, 'Let us drink,' they would  all drink. If any one of them said, 'Let us play,' they all played. If  one said, 'Let us go a walking into the fields,' they went all. If it  were to go a hawking, or a hunting, the ladies mounted upon dainty  well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle, carried on their  lovely fists either a sparhawk, or a lanneret, or a marlin, and the young  gallants carried the other kinds of hawks. So nobly were they taught,  that there was neither he nor she amongst them, but could read, write,  sing, play upon several musical instruments, speak five or six several  languages, and compose in them all very quaintly, both in verse and  prose. Never were seen so valiant knights, so noble and worthy, so  dexterous and skilful both on foot and horseback, more brisk and lively,  more nimble and quick, or better handling all manner of weapons, than  were there. Never were seen ladies so proper and handsome, so miniard  and dainty, less forward, or more ready with their hand, and with their  needle, in every honest and free action belonging to that sex, than were  there.\"    [Illustration]    +A few days ago+ the red ghost of revolution showed itself in the White  House. The President saw it and threatened it with his boxing fists:  \"What are you looking for here, be off to Russia.\" \"You are comical in  your excitement,\" answered Revolution. \"You must know, I am not only  Russian, I am international, at home here as well as on the other side  of the great water.\"    +A Proposition.+--Would it not be wiser to explain theories out of life  and not life out of theories?          VIVE LE ROI      BY FRANCES MAULE BJORKMAN           Aye, vive le roi. The King is dead--          So move our lives from day to day.       The triumph of to-morrow's lord          Meets for our former chief's decay.         Then love and live and laugh and sing--          The world is good and life is free--       There's not a single care I know          That's worth a single tear from me.         What's love or fame or place or power?          What's wealth when we shall come to die?       What matters anything on earth          So long as only I am I?         The Joy or grief or love or shame          That holds its little hour of sway       Is only worth its destined time--          What use to try to make it stay?         Aye, let it go. The monarch dead,          A better king our shouts may hail       And if a worse--well, still be glad;          He too will pass behind the vail.         They all must pass--fame, joy and love,          The sting of grief, the blot of shame;       The only thing that really counts          Is how we bear the praise or blame.         I'll take the good the while it lasts          And when it goes I'll learn to sing,       All eager for the coming joy--          \"The king is dead, long live the king.\"          Reflections of A Rich Man      +If God were not in existence+ we would have to order one from the  Professors of Theology.    The fear, instilled in the majority of the poor, with the God, Devil,  Heaven and Hell idea, is greater than their dread of a hundred thousand  policemen. Had we not given God the place of Chief Gendarme of the  Universe, we would need twice as many soldiers and police as we have  to-day.           *       *       *       *       *    +A poor devil+ who owns but one million dollars said to me the other day:  \"I, in your place, would rather contribute money towards art and  literature than to donate it to the Baptist Church.\" What an  impracticable fellow! Art and literature, among the common people, only  tends to cause mischief. They are to remain our privilege. We know the  demands of good taste and we can afford to pay for the aesthetic  pleasures of life. The majority is unable to do that; besides, to teach  them the beauty of art only means to make them discontented and  rebellious against our authority.           *       *       *       *       *    +I frankly admit+ I never had a great admiration for Jesus of Nazareth. A  man of disordered circumstances arouses my disgust. Jesus was neither  engaged in any kind of a business, nor did he possess as much as a bank  account, nor even a steady home. He preached to the poor. What for? The  poor should work and not philosophize. The Scriptures tell nowhere that  Jesus returned the mule, upon which he made his entry into Jerusalem, to  the owner, or that he paid him for it. I strongly suspect he did not do  it. One thing is certain, I never would have taken this dreamer of the  abolition of profits as my business partner.           *       *       *       *       *    +It was very hot+ yesterday. I walked through my park, intending to betake  myself to my favorite place for rest and reverie. Suddenly I stood  still, arrested by the sight of a man lying under a tree. In my park?  And how the fellow looked! In rags and dirty! I have been told I was  kind-hearted, and I realized this myself at the moment. I walked over to  the man and inquired interestedly: \"Are you ill?\" He grunted in reply.  The wretch must have thought, in his sleep, that I was one of his kind.  My generosity did not cease. \"If you need money, do not feel shy about  telling me. How much do you need. I am the rich X Y Z, who has a  fabulous fortune, as you have undoubtedly heard.\" At this remark the  scoundrel turned on the other side, with his back toward me, and said,  while yawning: \"What I want? I want to sleep. Will you be good enough to  keep the mosquitoes away for two hours?\" Within five minutes I had my  servant kick this impertinent and ungrateful wretch out of my park. If  all of the low class think as this fellow, I fear our charitable efforts  in their behalf will accomplish little.    [Illustration]    +Eleven million+, nine hundred and seventeen thousand, nine hundred and  forty-six dollars and fifty-eight cents is what the gallant Gen. Bingham  asks us for protecting us from each other for the ensuing year. With a  population of four million and 4.50 members to a family, we pay a  fraction less than $3 per head, and about $13.50 for a family, a year  for police protection in this enlightened Christian (750,000 of us are  Jews, but ours is a Christian city) city of ours. I'd give that silver  watch of mine away and mind my own business if I thought it would come  cheaper, but it won't do. H. H. Rogers is my brother and keeper, and he  insists he needs protection, and I must pay for it, so what can I do?  I've told him I'm a peaceful, propertyless man with no higher ambition  than to love my fellow-man--and woman, and mind my own business; but his  reply has invariably been, \"I'm Dr. Tarr, and my system prevails in this  lunatic asylum!\" I recognize the logic of his argument all right and  continue to pay for his protection and feel grateful for the privilege  of grumbling a little now and again.          COMSTOCKERY    By JOHN R. CORYELL      Be it understood that the shocking thing which we know as Comstockery,  goes back into the centuries for its origin; being, indeed, the perfect  flower of that asceticism, which was engrafted on the degraded  Christianity which took its name from Christ without in the least  comprehending the spirit of his lofty conception.    The man Comstock, who has the shameful distinction of having lent his  name to the idea of which he is the willing and probably the fit  exponent, may be dismissed without further consideration, since he is,  after all, only the inevitable as he is the deplorable result of that  for which he stands; seemingly without any sense of the shame and the  awfulness of it.    It may be said, too, in dismissing him, that it is of no consequence  whether the very unpleasant stories current concerning him are true or  not. It is altogether probable that a man who stands for what he does  and who glories in proclaiming the things he does, will also do things  for which he does not stand and which he does not proclaim. That is a  characteristic of most of us and only proves that, after all, he is not  less than human.    The only point that need be made in regard to the man who is proud of  representing Comstockery is, that if he had not done so, some other lost  soul would. In that sad stage of our social growth when death was the  penalty for most infractions of the law, an executioner could always be  found who took pride in his work and who seemed to be beyond the reach  of the scorn, the abhorrence and the contempt of his fellows.    Comstockery, as we know it, is apparently an organized effort to  regulate the morals of the people. If it were nothing more than this, it  would be absurd and negligible, because futile; for what we call morals  are only the observances which the conditions of life impose upon a  people; and an act depends, for its moral status, upon its relation to  those conditions. As, for example, horse-stealing in a closely settled  community, which has its railroads and other means of communication, is  a crime to be punished by a brief period of imprisonment; while in the  sparsely settled sections of a country, where the horse is an imperative  necessity of life, its theft becomes a hanging matter, whatever the"]]]
