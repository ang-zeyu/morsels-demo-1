First the inside pair, 7 and 9, are guarded together with the guard  outside, then the next pair, 5 and 11, then 3 and 13, and then the  outside pair, 1 and 15, which should have the guard outside. A plan  for the whole book would be more conveniently written thus--        1-15   17-31   33-47      3-13   19-29   35-45      5-11   21-27   37-43      7-9    23-25   39-41, and so on.    To arrange a book of single leaves for guarding, it is convenient to  take as many leaves as you intend to go to a section, and opening them  in the centre, take a pair at a time as they come.    The number of leaves it is advisable to put into a section will depend  on the thickness of the paper and the size and thickness of the book.  If the paper is thick, and the backs of the leaves have been pared,  four leaves to a section will be found to answer. But if the paper is  thin, and does not allow of much paring, it is better to have a larger  section, in order to have as little thread in the back as possible.    The sheets of any guarded book should be pressed before sewing, in  order to reduce the swelling of the back caused by the guards.                                   THROWING OUT        [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    Maps or diagrams that are frequently referred to in the text of a  book, should be \"thrown out\" on a guard as wide as the sheet of the  book. Such maps, &c., should be placed at the end, so that they may  lie open for reference while the book is being read (see fig. 14).  Large folded maps or diagrams should be mounted on linen. To do this  take a piece of jaconet and pin it out flat on the board, then evenly  paste the back of the map with thin paste in which there are no lumps,  and lay it on the linen, rub down through blotting-paper, and leave to  dry. Unless the pasting is done evenly the marks of the paste-brush  will show through the linen. If a folded map is printed on very thick  paper each fold must be cut up, and the separate pieces mounted on the  linen, with a slight space between them to form a flexible joint.        [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    A folded map must have in the back of the book sufficient guards to  equal it in thickness at its thickest part when folded, or the book  will not shut properly (see fig. 15).                                   PARING PAPER    For paring the edge of paper for mending or guarding, take a very  sharp knife, and holding the blade at right angles to the  covering-board, draw the edge once or twice along it from left to  right. This should turn up enough of the edge to form a \"burr,\" which  causes the knife to cut while being held almost flat on the paper. The  plate or paper should be laid face downwards on the glass with the  edge to be pared away from the workman, the knife held in the right  hand, with the burr downwards. The angle at which to hold the knife  will depend on its shape and on the thickness and character of the  paper to be pared, and can only be learned by practice. If the knife  is in order, and is held at the proper angle, the shaving removed from  a straight edge of paper should come off in a long spiral. If the  knife is not in proper order, the paper may be badly jagged or  creased.                             SOAKING OFF INDIA PROOFS    Place a piece of well-sized paper in a pan of warm water, then lay the  mounted India proof, face downwards, upon it and leave it to soak  until the proof floats off. Then carefully take out the old mount, and  the India proof can be readily removed from the water on the under  paper, and dried between sheets of blotting-paper.                             MOUNTING VERY THIN PAPER    Very thin paper, such as that of some \"India\" proofs, may be safely  mounted as follows:--The mount, ready for use, is laid on a pad of  blotting-paper. The thin paper to be mounted is laid face downwards on  a piece of glass and very carefully pasted with thin, white paste. Any  paste on the glass beyond the edges of the paper is carefully wiped  off with a clean cloth. The glass may then be turned over, and the  pasted plate laid on the mount, its exact position being seen through  the glass.                                  SPLITTING PAPER    It is sometimes desirable to split pieces of paper when the matter on  one side only is needed, or when the matter printed on each side is to  be used in different places. The paper to be split should be well  pasted on both sides with a thickish paste, and fine linen or jaconet  placed on each side. It is then nipped in the press to make the linen  stick all over, and left to dry.    If the two pieces of jaconet are carefully pulled apart when dry, half  the paper should be attached to each, unless at any point the paste  has failed to stick, when the paper will tear. The jaconet and paper  attached must be put into warm water until the split paper floats off.                             INLAYING LEAVES OR PLATES        [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    When a small plate or leaf has to be inserted into a larger book, it  is best to \"inlay it\"; that is to say, the plate or leaf is let into a  sheet of paper the size of the page of the book. To do this, a piece  of paper as thick as the plate to be inlaid, or a little thicker, is  selected, and on this is laid the plate, which should have been  previously squared, and the positions of the corners marked with a  folder. A point is made about an eighth of an inch inside each corner  mark, and the paper within these points is cut out (see fig. 16). This  leaves a frame of paper, the inner edges of which will slightly  overlap the edges of the plate. The under edge of the plate, and the  upper edge of the mount, should then be pared and pasted, and the  plate laid in its place (with the corners corresponding to the folder  marks). If the edges have been properly pared, the thickness where  they overlap should not exceed the thickness of the frame paper. If an  irregular fragment is to be inlaid, it is done in the same way, except  that the entire outline is traced on the new paper with a folder, and  the paper cut away, allowing one eighth of an inch inside the indented  line.                                 FLATTENING VELLUM    The leaves of a vellum book that have become cockled from damp or  other causes may be flattened by damping them, pulling them out  straight, and allowing them to dry under pressure. To do this take the  book to pieces, clean out any dirt there may be in the folds of the  leaves, and spread out each pair of leaves as flatly as possible.    Damp some white blotting-paper by interleaving it with common white  paper that has been wetted with a sponge. One sheet of wet paper to  two of blotting-paper will be enough. The pile of blotting-paper and  wet paper is put in the press and left for an hour or two under  pressure, then taken out and the common paper removed.    The blotting-paper should now be slightly and evenly damp. To flatten  the vellum the open pairs of leaves are interleaved with the slightly  damp blotting-paper, and are left for an hour under the weight of a  pressing-board. After this time the vellum will have become quite  soft, and can with care be flattened out and lightly pressed between  the blotting-paper, and left for a night. The next day the vellum  leaves should be looked at to see that they lie quite flat, and the  blotting-paper changed for some that is dry. The vellum must remain  under pressure until it is quite dry, or it will cockle up worse than  ever when exposed to the air. The blotting-paper should be changed  every day or two. The length of time that vellum leaves take to dry  will vary with the state of the atmosphere, and the thickness of the  vellum, from one to six weeks.    Almost any manuscript or printed book on vellum can be successfully  flattened in this way; miniatures should have pieces of waxed paper  laid over them to prevent the chance of any of the fibres of the  blotting-paper sticking. The pressure must not be great; only enough  is needed to keep the vellum flat as it dries.    This process of flattening, although so simple, requires the utmost  care. If the blotting-paper is used too damp, a manuscript may be  ruined; and if not damp enough, the pressing will have no effect.                                        CHAPTER IV                           Sizing--Washing--Mending                                      SIZING    The paper in old books is sometimes soft and woolly. This is generally  because the size has perished, and such paper can often be made  perfectly sound by resizing.        [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    For size, an ounce of isinglass or good gelatine is dissolved in a  quart of water. This should make a clear solution when gently warmed,  and should be used at about a temperature of 120 deg. F. Care must be  taken not to heat too quickly, or the solution may burn and turn  brown. If the size is not quite clear, it should be strained through  fine muslin or linen before being used. When it is ready it should be  poured into an open pan (fig. 17), so arranged that it can be kept  warm by a gas flame or spirit lamp underneath. When this is ready the  sheets to be sized can be put in one after another and taken out at  once. The hot size will be found to take out a great many stains, and  especially those deep brown stains that come from water. If there are  only a few sheets, they can be placed between blotting-paper as they  are removed from the size; but if there is a whole book, it is best to  lay them in a pile one on the other, and when all have been sized to  squeeze them in the \"lying press\" between pressing-boards, a pan being  put underneath to catch the liquid squeezed out. When the sheets have  been squeezed they can be readily handled, and should be spread out to  dry on a table upon clean paper. When they are getting dry and firm  they can be hung on strings stretched across the room, slightly  overlapping one another.

For _Gilderoy_, that Love of mine,    Geud faith Ise freely bought:  A Wedding-sark of Holland fine,    With Silk in Flowers wrought:  And he gave me a Wedding Ring,    Which I receiv'd with Joy;  No Lads or Lasses e'er could Sing,    _Like my sweet_ Gilderoy.    In mickle Joy we spent our time,    Till we was both Fifteen;  Then gently he did lay me down,    Amongst the leaves so green:  When he had done what he could do,    He rose and he gang'd his way;  But ever since I lov'd the Man,    _My Handsome_ Gilderoy.    While we did both together play,    He kiss'd me o'er and o'er;  Geud faith it was as blith a Day,    As e'er I saw before:  He fill'd my Heart in every Vein,    With Love and mickle Joy;  Who was my Love and Hearts delight,    _Mine own sweet_ Gilderoy.    Oh never, never shall I see,    The cause of past Delight;  Or sike a lovely Lad as he,    Transport my Ravish'd sight:  The Law forbids what Love enjoyns,    And does prevent our Joy;  Though just and fair were the Designs,    _Of me and_ Gilderoy.    'Cause _Gilderoy_ had done amiss,    Must he be punish'd then;  What kind of Cruelty is this    To hang such Handsom Men?  The Flower of the _Scotish_ land,    A sweet and lovely Boy;  He likewise had a Lady's Hand,    _My Handsom_ Gilderoy.    At _Leith_ they took my _Gilderoy_,    And there God wot they bang'd him:  Carry'd him to fair _Edenburgh_,    And there God wot they hang'd him:  They hang'd him up above the rest,    He was so trim a Boy;  My only Love and Heart's Delight,    _My Handsom_ Gilderoy.    Thus having yielded up his Breath,    In _Cypress_ he was laid;  Then for my dearest, after Death,    A Funeral I made:  Over his Grave a Marble-stone,    I fixed for my Joy;  Now I am left to weep alone,    _For my dear_ Gilderoy.          _The_ SCOTCH _Wedding_    _Between_ JOCKEY _and_ JENNY.      [Music]    Then _Jockey_ wou'd a Wooing away,    On our Feast-day when he was foo;  Then _Jenny_ put on her best Array,    When she thought _Jockey_ would come to Woo.    If I thought _Jockey_ were come to Town,    It wad be for the leve of me;  Then wad I put on beth Hat and Goown,    Because I'd seem worstsome in his Eye.    Then _Jenny_ prick'd up a brant breeght broow,    She was as breeght as onny clock;  As _Moggy_ always used to do,    For fear her Sweet-heart shou'd her mock.    Then _Jenny_ shoo tripped up the Stairs,    And secretly to shift her Smock;  But leard how loud her mother swears,    O hast away _Jenny_, and come to _Jock_.    Then _Jenny_ came tripping down the Stairs,    Oh Leard so nimbly tripped she;  But oh how _Jockey_ began to stare,    When he beheld hur fair Beauty!    Then _Jenny_ made a Curtshy low,    Until the Stairs did touch her Dock;  But Leard how loud her Mother did lough,    When shoo _Jenny_ was come to _Jock_.    Then _Jockey_ tuke _Jenny_ by the Nease,    Saying my dear Lovey canst thou loof me?  My Father is Dead and has left me Land,    Some fair ould Houses twa or three.    Thou shalt be the Lady o'er them aw,    I doot, quod _Jenny_ you do me mock;  Ad ta my saw, quoth _Jockey_, then,    I come to woo thee _Jenny_, quoth _Jock_.      _This to be said after the_ SONG.

[Music]    Lately as thorough the fair _Edinborough_,    To view the fair Meadows as I was ganging;  _Jockey_ and _Moggy_ were walking and talking,    Of Love and Religion, thus closely Haranguing;  Never says _Moggy_, come near me false _Jockey_,    For thou art a _Whig_, and I mean to abhor thee;  Ize be no Bride, nor will lig by thy side,    For no sneaking Rebel shall lift a Leg o'er me.    _Jockey._ Fairest and Dearest,            And to my Heart nearest,    To live with thy Frowns I no longer am able;            I am so loving,            And thou art so moving,    Each Hair of thy Head ties me fast as a Cable:            Thou hast that in thee,            Ise sure to win me,    To _Jew_, _Turk_ or _Atheist_, so much I adore thee;            Nothing I'd shun,            That is under the Sun,    So I have the pleasure to lift a Leg o'er thee.    _Moggy._ Plotters and Traytors,            And Associators,    In every degree thou shalt swear to oppose 'em;            Swimmers and Trimmers,            The Nations Redeemers,    And for thy Reward thou shalt sleep in my Bosom;            I had a Dad,            Was a Royal brave Lad,    And as true as the Sun to his Monarch before me;            _Moggy_ he cry'd,            The same hour that he Dy'd,    Let no sneaking Rebel e'er lift a Leg o'er thee.    _Jockey._ Adieu then ye Crew then,            Of Protestant Blue Men,    No Faction his _Moggy_ from _Jockey_ shall sever;            Thou shalt at Court,            My Conversion Report,    I am not the first Whig by his Wife brought in favour;            Ise never deal,            For the dull Common Weal,    To fight for true Monarchy shall be my Glory;            Lull'd with thy Charms,            Then I die in your Arms,    When I have the Pleasure to lift a Leg o'er thee.          _The Fair Lass of_ ISLINGTON.      [Music]    There was a Lass of _Islington_,    As I have heard many tell;  And she would to Fair _London_ go,    Fine Apples and Pears to sell:  And as along the Streets she flung,    With her basket on her Arm:  Her Pears to sell, you may know it right well,    This fair Maid meant no harm.    But as she tript along the Street,    Her pleasant Fruit to sell;  A Vintner did with her meet,    Who lik'd this Maid full well:  Quoth he, fair Maid, what have you there?    In Basket decked brave;  Fine Pears, quoth she, and if it please ye    A taste Sir you shall have.    The Vintner he took a Taste,    And lik'd it well, for why;  This Maid he thought of all the rest,    Most pleasing to his Eye:  Quoth he, fair Maid I have a Suit,    That you to me must grant;  Which if I find you be so kind,    Nothing that you shall want.    Thy Beauty doth so please my Eye,    And dazles so my sight;  That now of all my Liberty,    I am deprived quite:  Then prithee now consent to me,    And do not put me by;  It is but one small courtesie,    All Night with you to lie.    Sir, if you lie with me one Night,    As you propound to me;  I do expect that you should prove,    Both courteous, kind and free:  And for to tell you all in short,    It will cost you Five Pound,  A Match, a Match, the Vintner said,    And so let this go round.    When he had lain with her all Night,    Her Money she did crave,  O stay, quoth he, the other Night,    And thy Money thou shalt have:  I cannot stay, nor I will not stay,    I needs must now be gone,  Why then thou may'st thy Money go look,    For Money I'll pay thee none.    This Maid she made no more ado,    But to a Justice went;  And unto him she made her moan,    Who did her Case lament:  She said she had a Cellar Let out,    To a Vintner in the Town;  And how that he did then agree    Five Pound to pay her down.    But now, quoth she, the Case is thus,    No Rent that he will pay;  Therefore your Worship I beseech,    To send for him this Day:  Then strait the Justice for him sent,    And asked the Reason why;  That he would pay this Maid no Rent?    To which he did Reply,    Although I hired a Cellar of her,    And the Possession was mine?  I ne'er put any thing into it,    But one poor Pipe of Wine:  Therefore my Bargain it was hard,    As you may plainly see;  I from my Freedom was Debarr'd,    Then good Sir favour me.    This Fair Maid being ripe of Wit,    She strait Reply'd again;  There were two Butts more at the Door,    Why did you not roul them in?  You had your Freedom and your Will,    As is to you well known;  Therefore I do desire still,    For to receive my own.    The Justice hearing of their Case,    Did then give Order strait;  That he the Money should pay down,    She should no longer wait:  Withal he told the Vintner plain    If he a Tennant be;  He must expect to pay the same,    For he could not sit Rent-free.    But when the Money she had got,    She put it in her Purse:  And clapt her Hand on the Cellar Door,    And said it was never the worse:  Which caused the People all to Laugh,    To see this Vintner Fine:  Out-witted by a Country Girl,    About his Pipe of Wine.          _The most Famous_ BALLAD    _Of King_ HENRY _the 5th; his Victory over the_ French _at_ Agencourt.      [Music]    A Councel grave our King did hold,    With many a Lord and Knight:  That he might truly understand,    That _France_ did hold his Right.    Unto the King of _France_ therefore,    Embassadors he sent;  That he might truly understand,    His Mind and whole Intent.    Desiring him in friendly sort,    His lawful Right to yield;  Or else he swore by dint of Sword,    To win it in the Field.    The King of _France_ with all his Lords,    Did hear this Message plain;  And to our brave Embassador,    Did answer with Disdain.    And said our King was yet too young,    And of but tender Age;  Therefore they pass not for his Threats,    Nor fear not his "]]]
