This residue may then be examined for iron, etc.      ~Marcasite~ (White Iron Pyrites).--Having the same general composition as  pyrite, but much lighter in color. Crystals, prismatic. Before the Bp.  on Ch. behaves like pyrite.      ~Pyrrhotite~, Fe_{7}S_{8}, Fe . 60.5, S . 39.5.--        H = 3.5-4.5, G = 4.58-4.64.    Color, bronze-yellow. Closely resembles pyrite, but may be distinguished  from it by being feebly magnetic. Heated in an ignition tube yields no  sublimate. Before the Bp. on Ch. fuses to a magnetic globule, which  exhibits a yellowish crystalline structure when fractured.      ~Mispickel~, FeAsS, Fe . 34, As . 46, S . 20.--H = 5.5-6.0, G = 6.0-6.2.  Color, silver-white. Lustre, metallic; very brittle. Often associated  with it we find small quantities of Co, Ag, and Au. Heated in an  ignition tube it first yields a red sublimate of sulphide of arsenic,  and then afterward a crystalline sublimate of metallic arsenic. Before  the Bp. on Ch. emits dense fumes of arsenic and deposits a coating on  the coal; it then fuses to a globule which behaves like pyrrhotite.      ~Siderite~, FeCO_{3}, FeO . 62, CO_{2} . 38.--H = 3.5-4.5, G = 3.7-3.9.  Color, grayish yellow to reddish brown. Lustre, pearly. Crystallizes in  rhombohedrons with curved faces; these crystals are distinctly cleavable  and massive. Heated in an ignition tube it decrepitates with evolution  of carbon dioxide. Before the Bp. on Ch. infusible. Before the Bp. on  Ch. with Na_{2}CO_{3} it fuses to a magnetic mass. With borax bead it  reacts for iron and sometimes for manganese.      ORES OF LEAD    ~Galena~, PbS, Pb . 87, S . 13.--        H = 2.5, G = 7.4-7.6.    Color, bluish gray, slowly tarnishing. Lustre, metallic. Crystals in the  form of cubes. Heated in an ignition tube it sometimes decrepitates and  yields a sublimate of sulphur. Before the Bp. on Ch. easily reduced to  the metallic state, the Ch. becoming coated with sulphate and oxide of  lead. The metallic globule usually contains a little silver. To separate  this, the process known as \"cupellation\" is employed. A hole is bored  into the Ch. about 1 cm. in diameter and about 6 mm. deep. Into this  hole is placed a stiff paste made by mixing finely pulverized bone-ash  with a little soda and water. This paste is pressed in hard, and then  the surface is smoothed off, and the centre is slightly depressed with  the rounded end of a glass rod. The charcoal so prepared is set in a  warm place to allow the paste to dry. When the paste is quite dry the  small globule of lead is placed in the depression in the centre of the  bone-ash \"cupel,\" and is there exposed to the O. F. from the Bp. The  lead is oxidized and is absorbed by the bone-ash, while any silver  present will remain in the central depression as a bright shining bead.      ~Cerusite~, PbCO_{3}, PbO . 84, CO_{2} . 16.--H = 3.0-3.5, G = 6.46-6.57.

The stem is thin and fistulose.    Cordier states that all the species of _Coprinus_ are edible when young  and fresh. This is probably true, but most of them have so little  substance and are so ephemeral as to be of small value for food  purposes. _C. comatus_, _C. atramentarius_, _C. micaceus_, and _C.  ovatus_ have the preference with most mycophagists, but even these soon  melt, and should be gathered promptly and cooked immediately to be of  use for the table.

Cap at first oblong or cylindrical, then campanulate, the cuticle  breaking into shaggy fibrous scales, color whitish, the scales generally  yellow or yellowish, margin revolute and lacerated, soon becoming black.  Gills linear, free, and close together, at first white, then pink or  purplish, turning to black. Stem hollow or slightly stuffed, nearly  equal, somewhat fibrillose, with bulb solid; the ring movable or very  slightly adherent, generally disappearing as the plant matures. Spores  oval, black, .0005 to .0007 in. long.    This species is found in abundance in different parts of the United  States, generally in rich soil, in pastures, by roadsides, in dumping  lots, etc. Of late years quantities have been gathered in the lawn  surrounding the Capitol grounds, and in the parks of the District of  Columbia, as well as in the debris of the wooden block pavements used  for surface soiling gardens in vicinity of the capital. They have been  offered for sale in open market as low as 25 cents per pound.    A correspondent from Rochester, New York, states that in a patch of his  grounds which had been quarried out and filled with street sweepings the  Coprinus comatus appeared in such quantities as to make it impossible to  walk over the space without stepping upon them, and that he was able to  gather from this small space from one to two bushels at a time in the  spring and the fall. In flavor the C. comatus resembles the cultivated  mushroom, though perhaps more delicate.    The _Coprinus ovatus_, \"_Oval Coprinus_,\" a closely allied species, is  similar to the comatus, but smaller, more ovate in shape and delicate in  flavor, less deliquescent; stem usually 3/4 of an inch long. The  _Coprinus atramentarius_ has a mouse-gray or brownish cap with irregular  margin, slightly striated. It is not shaggy, but is spotted with minute,  innate punctate scales. The stem is hollow, somewhat ringed when young.  Spores elliptical, black.    _Coprinus micaceus_ is a very common species, and is found generally in  clusters on old tree stumps or on decaying wood. The cap is thin and of  a reddish buff or ochraceous tint, often showing a sprinkling of  glistening micaceous scales or granules; gills crowded, whitish. It is  at first ovate or bell-shaped, then expanding; striated. The stem is  white, slender, and hollow, not ringed. The spores in this species are a  very dark brown, which is unusual in the genus _Coprinus_.    It is generally found in decaying wood or old tree-stumps, growing in  dense clusters.    Prof. Peck says: \"European writers do not record the '_Glistening  coprinus_' among the edible species, perhaps because of its small size.  But it compensates for its lack of size by its frequency and abundance.  In tenderness and delicacy it does not appear to be at all inferior to  the '_Shaggy coprinus_.'\"         EXPLANATION OF PLATE II.         =Coprinus comatus= Fr. _The Shaggy Maned Mushroom_.

Genus _Marasmius_ Fries.--Tough dry shrivelling fungi--not putrescent,  reviving when moistened; veil none. Stem cartilaginous or horny. Gills  tough, rather distant, edge acute and entire. M. C. Cooke.    A characteristic of the species of this genus is their tendency to  wither with drought and revive with moisture. This biological  characteristic is of great importance in determining the true Marasmii.  The plants are usually small and of little substance.    Cooke divides the Marasmii into three tribes, and these again into  several subdivisions. In the division Scortei of this genus are classed  three species which are described in the works of most of the  Continental writers; the Marasmius oreades, which has recognized value  as an esculent, Marasmius urens and Marasmius peronatus, which have the  reputation of being acrid and unwholesome.         [Illustration: Plate III.       MARASMIUS OREADES FR. (EDIBLE)       The Fairy Ring Mushroom.       Report of Microscopist, U. S. Department of Agriculture 1893       L. K. after Gillet.       AVIL. CO. LITH. PHILA.]         PLATE III.         =Marasmius oreades= Fries. \"_Fairy Ring Mushroom_.\"         EDIBLE.    Cap fleshy, convex at first, then nearly plane, pale yellowish red, or  tawny red when young, fading to yellow or buff as the plant matures,  slightly umbonate, flesh white; gills broad, wide apart, rounded or  deeply notched at the inner extremity, slightly attached to or at length  free from the stem, unequal in length, whitish or creamy yellow in  color; stem slender, solid and tough, whitish, generally one to two  inches in length and one-fourth of an inch in thickness, showing a  whitish down, easily removed, not strigose or villose, as in the  Marasmius urens. Spores white.    This species is usually found in open grassy places, sometimes in rings,  or in parts of rings, often in clusters, and writers generally agree as  to its agreeable taste and odor. When properly cooked its toughness  disappears.    Prof. Peck describes two mushrooms which are somewhat similar in  appearance to the \"_Fairy Ring_,\" and which might be taken for it by  careless observers, viz., the Naucoria semi-orbicularis, sometimes  growing in company with it, and the _Collybia dryophila_, a wood variety  which is sometimes found in open places.    The first of these may be distinguished from the _oreades_, by the rusty  brown color of the gills, its smooth stem and rusty colored spores. In  the second the gills are much narrower and the stem is very smooth and  hollow.    The _Marasmius urens_ as described by European authors has a pale buff  cap, not umbonate but flat, and at length depressed in the centre, from  one to two inches across. The gills are unequal, free, very crowded;  cream color, becoming brownish. The stem is solid and fibrous, densely  covered with white down at the base. It is very acrid to the taste. In  habit of growth it is subcaespitose; sometimes found growing in company  with the M. oreades.    Prof. Peck says of _M. urens_ that he has not yet seen an American  specimen which he could refer to that species with satisfaction. Our  experience, so far, is the same as that of Prof. Peck.    _Marasmius peronatus_ has a reddish buff cap, with crowded thin gills,  creamy, turning to reddish brown; the stem solid and fibrous, with  yellowish filaments at the base. It is acrid in taste and is usually  found among fallen leaves in woods.         EXPLANATION OF PLATE III.

APPENDIX A.      PRESERVING AND COOKING MUSHROOMS.    In Europe several species of mushrooms are preserved by boiling and  afterwards placing them in earthern jars or tubs filled with water,  which is renewed from time to time. This simple and economical method of  keeping mushrooms affords the people considerable provision. With regard  to the preparation of fresh mushrooms for table use, Dr. Roques, an  eminent writer on fungi, gives the following excellent suggestions:  \"After selecting good mushrooms, remove the skin or epidermis, cutting  away the gills, and in some cases the stem, which is usually of not so  fine a texture.    \"It is important to collect for use only young and well-preserved  specimens, because a mushroom of excellent quality may, nevertheless,  when overmature or near its decline, become dangerous for food. It then  acts as does every other food substance which incipient decomposition  has rendered acrid, irritating and indigestible. It is, moreover, rarely  the case that mushrooms in their decline are not changed by the presence  of larvae.\"    In Geneva a very lucrative trade is carried on in the exportation of the  \"_Edible Boletus_,\" which is preserved for use in various ways, the  simplest of which consists in cutting the caps in slices and stringing  them, after which they are placed on hurdles in the shade to dry. They  may also be dried in a stove or oven, but the former method is  preferable, as the mushroom then retains more of its flavor or perfume.  When the slices are perfectly dried they are put into sacks and  suspended in a dry, airy place. Sometimes before the mushrooms are  sliced they are plunged into boiling water for an instant, which  treatment is said to preserve them from the ravages of insects. Several  kinds of mushrooms are preserved in the"]]]
