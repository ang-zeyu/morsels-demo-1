King Harald's men chased them far, but during the night came  back to camp. Many brought swords and helmets and bracelets or  silver-trimmed saddles and bridles with them.    \"Here is what we got from the foe,\" they said.    The next morning King Harald spoke to his men:    \"Let us go about and find our dead.\"    [Illustration: \"_King Haki fell dead under 'Foes'-fear'_\"]    So they went over all the battle-field. They put every man on his shield  and carried him and laid him on a hill-top. They hung his sword over his  shoulder and laid his spear by his side. So they laid all the dead  together there on the hill-top. Then King Harald said, looking about:    \"This is a good place to lie. It looks far over the country. The sound  of the sea reaches it. The wind sweeps here. It is a good grave for  Norsemen and Vikings. But it is a long road and a rough road to Valhalla  that these men must travel. Let the nearest kinsman of each man come and  tie on his hell-shoes. Tie them fast, for they will need them much on  that hard road.\"    So friends tied shoes on the dead men's feet. Then King Harald said:    \"Now let us make the mound.\"    Every man set to work with what tools he had and heaped earth over the  dead until a great mound stood up. They piled stones on the top. On one  of these stones King Harald made runes telling how these men had died.    After that was done King Harald said:    \"Now set up the pole, Thorstein. Let every man bring to that pole all  that he took from the foe.\"    So they did, and there was a great hill of things around it. Harald  divided it into piles.    \"This pile we will give to Thor in thanks for the victory,\" he said.  \"This pile is mine because I am king. Here are the piles for the chiefs,  and these things go to the other men of the army.\"    So every man went away from that battle richer than he was before, and  Thor looked down from Valhalla upon his full temple and was pleased.    The next morning King Harald led his army back. But on the way he met  other foes and had many battles and did not lose one. The kings either  died in battle or ran away, and Harald had their lands.    \"He has kept his vow,\" men said, \"and ground his father's foes under his  heel.\"    So King Harald sat in peace for a while.          [Illustration]    Gyda's Saucy Message      Now Harald heard men talk of Gyda, the daughter of King Eric.    \"She is very beautiful,\" they said, \"but she is very proud, too. She can  both read and make runes. No other woman in the world knows so much  about herbs as she does. She can cure any sickness. And she is proud of  all this!\"    Now when King Harald heard that, he thought to himself:    \"Fair and proud. I like them both. I will have her for my wife.\"    So he called his uncle, Guthorm, and said:    \"Take rich gifts and go to Gyda's foster-father[8] and tell him that I  will marry Gyda.\"    So Guthorm and his men came to that house and they told the king's  message to the foster-father. Gyda was standing near, weaving a rich  cloak. She heard the speech. She came up and said, holding her head  high and curling her lip:    \"I will not waste myself on a king of so few people. Norway is a strange  country. There is a little king here and a little king there--hundreds  of them scattered about. Now in Denmark there is but one great king over  the whole land. And it is so in Sweden. Is no one brave enough to make  all of Norway his own?\"    She laughed a scornful laugh and walked away. The men stood with open  mouths and stared after her. Could it be that she had sent that saucy  message to King Harald? They looked at her foster-father. He was  chuckling in his beard and said nothing to them. They started out of the  house in anger. When they were at the door, Gyda came up to them again  and said:    \"Give this message to your King Harald for me: I will not be his wife  unless he puts all of Norway under him for my sake.\"    [Illustration: \"_I will not be his wife unless he puts all of Norway  under him for my sake_\"]    So Guthorm and his men rode homeward across the country. They did not  talk. They were all thinking. At last one said:    \"How shall we give this message to the king?\"    \"I have been thinking of that,\" Guthorm said; \"his anger is no little  thing.\"    It was late when they rode into the king's yard; for they had ridden  slowly, trying to make some plan for softening the message, but they had  thought of none.    \"I see light through the wind's-eyes of the feast hall,\" one said.    \"Yes, the king keeps feast,\" Guthorm said. \"We must give our message  before all his guests.\"    So they went in with very heavy hearts. There sat King Harald in the  high seat. The benches on both sides were full of men. The tables had  been taken out, and the mead-horns were going round.    \"Oh, ho!\" cried King Harald. \"Our messengers! What news?\"    Then Guthorm said:    \"This Gyda is a bold and saucy girl, King Harald. My tongue refuses to  give her message.\"    The king stamped his foot.    \"Out with it!\" he cried. \"What does she say?\"    \"She says that she will not marry so little a king,\" Guthorm answered.    Harald jumped to his feet. His face flushed red. Guthorm stretched out  his hand.    \"They are not my words, O King; they are the words of a silly girl.\"    \"Is there any more?\" the king shouted. \"Go on!\"    \"She said: 'There is one king in Denmark and one king in Sweden. Is  there no man brave enough to make himself king of all Norway? Tell King  Harald that I will not marry him unless he puts all of Norway under him  for my sake.'\"    The guests sat speechless, staring at Guthorm. All at once the king  broke into a roar of laughter.    \"By the hammer of Thor!\" he cried, \"that is a good message. I thank you,  Gyda. Did you hear it, friends? King of all Norway! Why, we are all  stupids. Why did we not think of that?\"    Then he raised his horn high.    \"Now hear my vow. I say that I will not cut my hair or comb it until I  am king of all Norway. That I will be or I will die.\"    Then he drank off the horn of mead, and while he drank it, all the men  in the hall stood up and waved their swords and shouted and shouted.  That old hall in all its two hundred years of feasts had not heard such  a noise before.    \"Ah, Harald!\" Guthorm cried, \"surely Thor in Valhalla smiled when he  heard that vow.\"    The men sat all night talking of that wonderful vow.    On the very next day King Harald sent out his war-arrows. Soon a great  army was gathered. They marched through the country north and south and  east and west, burning houses and fighting battles as they went. People  fled before them, some to their own kings, some inland to the deep woods  and hid there. But some went to King Harald and said:    \"We will be your men.\"    \"Then take the oath, and I will be friends with you,\" he said.    The men took off their swords and laid them down and came one by one and  knelt before the king. They put their heads between his knees and said:    \"From this day, Harald Halfdanson, I am your man. I will serve you in  war. For my land I will pay you taxes. I will be faithful to you as my  king.\"    Then Harald said:    \"I am your king, and I will be faithful to you.\"    Many kings took that oath and thousands of common men. Of all the  battles that Harald fought, he did not lose one.    Now for a long time the king's hair and beard had not been combed or  cut. They stood out around his head in a great bushy mat of yellow. At a  feast one day when the jokes were going round, Harald's uncle said:    \"Harald, I will give you a new name. After this you shall be called  Harald Shockhead. As my naming gift I give you this drinking-horn.\"    \"It is a good name,\" laughed all the men.    After that all people called him Harald Shockhead.    During these wars, whenever King Harald got a country for his own, this  is what he did. He said:    \"All the marshland and the woodland where no people live is mine. For  his farm every man shall pay me taxes.\"    Over every country he put some brave, wise man and called him Earl. He  said to the earls:    \"You shall collect the taxes and pay them to me. But some you shall keep  for yourselves. You shall punish any man who steals or murders or does  any wicked thing. When your people are in trouble they shall come to  you, and you shall set the thing right. You must keep peace in the land.  I will not have my people troubled with robber vikings.\"    The earls did all these things as best they could; for they were good  strong men. The farmers were happy. They said:    \"We can work on our farms with peace now. Before King Harald came,  something was always wrong. The vikings would come and steal our gold  and our grain and burn our houses, or the king would call us to war.  Those little kings are always fighting. It is better under King Harald.\"    But the chiefs, who liked to fight and go a-viking, hated King Harald  and his new ways. One of these chiefs was Solfi. He was a king's son.  Harald had killed his father in battle. Solfi had been in that battle.  At the end of it he fled away with two hundred men and got into ships.    \"We will make that Shockhead smart,\" he said.    So they harried the coast of King Harald's country. They filled their  ships with gold. They ate other men's meals. They burned farmhouses  behind them. The people cried out to the earls for help. So the earls  had out their ships all the time trying to catch Solfi, but he was too  clever for them.    In the spring he went to a certain king, Audbiorn, and said to him:    \"Now, there are two things that we can do. We can become this Shockhead  Harald's thralls, we can kneel before him and put our heads between his  knees. Or else we can fight. My father thought it better to die in  battle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#6)"],[1,", we'll hunt, as, I know, we've got plenty of  room out here: we'll have an elephant farm instead, and grow ivory, and  have a big warehouse for making potted elephant to send and sell at home  for a breakfast appetiser.  Who's going to give up, eh?  Now, then, what  about this canter?  The horses want a breather--they're getting fidgety.  I say, feel better now, old chap, don't you?\"    Dyke pinched his lips together and nodded shortly.    \"So do I.--Here!  What's that?\"    He checked his horse, and pointed far away in the distance.    \"Ostrich!\" cried Dyke.    \"Yes, I saw her rise and start off!  My word! how she is going.  I can  see the spot where she got up, and must keep my eyes on it.  There's a  nest there, for a pound.  That means luck this morning.  Come along  steady.  Lucky I brought the net.  Why, Dyke, old chap, the tide's going  to turn, and we shall do it yet.\"    \"But the goblin's dead.\"    \"Good job, too.  There's as good ostriches in the desert as ever came  out, though they are fowl instead of fish.  It's my belief we shall  snatch out of that nest a better game-cock bird than ever the goblin  was, and without his temper.  Come along.\"    Dyke felt glad of the incident occurring when it did, for his mind was  in a peculiar state just then.  His feelings were mingled.  He felt  relieved and satisfied by having shifted something off his mind, but at  the same time there would come a sense of false shame, and a fancy that  he had behaved childishly, when it was as brave and manly a speech--that  confession--as ever came from his lips.    All the same, on they rode.  And now the sky looked brighter; there  seemed to be an elasticity in the air.  Breezy had never carried Dyke so  well before, and a sensation came over him, making him feel that he must  shout and sing and slacken his rein, and gallop as hard as the cob could  go.    \"Yohoy there! steady, lad,\" cried Emson; \"not so fast, or I shall lose  the spot.  It's hard work, little un, keeping your eye on anything, with  the horse pitching you up and down.\"    Hard work, indeed, for there was no tree, bush, or hillock out in the  direction they were taking, and by which the young Englishman could mark  down the spot where he imagined the nest to be.    So Dyke slackened speed, and with his heart throbbing in a pleasantly  exhilarated fashion, he rode steadily on beside his brother, feeling as  if the big fellow were the boy once more whom as a child he used to  tease and be chased playfully in return.  Emson's way of speaking, too,  enhanced the feeling.    \"I say, little un,\" he cried, \"what a game if there's no nest after all.  You won't be disappointed, will you?\"    \"Of course not.\"    \"'Member me climbing the big elm at the bottom of the home-close to get  the mag's nest?\"    \"To be sure I do.\"    \"Didn't think we two would ever go bird's-nesting in Africa then, did  we?\"    \"No; but do you think there is a nest out yonder, Joe?\"    \"I do,\" cried Emson, \"I've seen several hen birds about the last few  days; but I never could make out which way they came or went.  I've been  on the lookout, too, for one rising from the ground.\"    \"But is this a likely place for a nest?\"    \"Well, isn't it?  I should say it's the very spot.  Now, just look: here  we are in an open plain, where a bird can squat down in the sand and  look around for twenty miles--if she can see so far--in every direction,  and see danger coming, whether it's a man, a lion, or a jackal, and  shuffle off her nest, and make tracks long before whatever it is gets  near enough to make out where she rose.  Of course I don't know whether  we shall find the nest, if there is one.  It's hard enough to find a  lark's or a partridge's nest at home in an open field of forty or fifty  acres; so of course, big though the nest is, and the bird, it's a deal  harder, out in a field hundreds of miles square, eh?\"    \"Of course it is.\"    \"'Scuse my not looking round at you when I'm speaking, old chap; but if  I take my eye off the spot, I shall never find it again.\"    \"I say, don't be so jolly particular, Joe,\" cried Dyke, laughing.    \"Why not?  It's just what you and I ought to be,\" said the big fellow  with simple earnestness.  \"We're out here in a savage land, but we don't  want to grow into savages, nor yet to be as blunt and gruff as two  bears.  I'm not going to forget that the dear old governor at home is a  gentleman, even if his sons do rough it out here.\"    \"Till they're regular ruffians, Joe.--I say: see the nest?\"    \"Oh no; it's a mile away yet.\"    \"Then there isn't one.  You couldn't have seen it at all that distance.\"    \"I never said I could see the nest, did I?  It was enough for me that  I've seen the birds about, and that I caught sight of that one making  off this morning.  We call them stupid, and they are in some things; but  they're precious cunning in others.\"    \"But if they were only feeding?\"    \"Why, then, there's no nest.  But I say breeding, and not feeding; and  that's rhyme if you take it in time, as the old woman said.\"    \"But you talked about hen birds.  Then there may be more than one nest?\"    \"Not here.  Why, you know how a lot of them lay in the same nest.\"    \"At home, shut up in pens, but not on the veldt.\"    \"Why, of course they do, and 'tis their nature to, like the bears and  lions in Dr Watts.  You don't know everything quite yet, old chap.  If  you took the glass, and came and lay out here for two or three days and  nights, and always supposing the birds didn't see you--because if they  did they'd be deserting the nest and go somewhere else--you'd see first  one hen come to lay and then another, perhaps six of them; and when  they'd packed the nest as full as it would hold, with the sand banked up  round the eggs to keep them tight in their places with the points  downwards, so as to be close, you'd see hen after hen come and take her  turn, sitting all day, while the cock bird comes at nights and takes his  turn, because he's bigger and stronger, and better able to pitch into  the prowling jackals.\"    \"How did you know all this, Joe?\"    \"Partly observation, partly from what I've heard Jack say,\" replied  Emson modestly.  \"Everything comes in useful.  I daresay you won't  repent saving up all those odds and ends of stones and shells and eggs  you've got at home.\"    \"Why, I often thought you'd feel they were a nuisance, Joe.  I did see  you laugh at them more than once.\"    \"Smile, old man, smile--that's all.  I like it.  You might grow a  regular museum out of small beginnings like that.\"    \"Then we ought to have stuffed the goblin,\" cried Dyke merrily.    \"Oh, come, no; that wouldn't do.  Our tin house isn't the British  Museum; but I would go on collecting bits of ore and things.  You may  find something worth having one of these days, besides picking up a lot  of knowledge.  I'd put that piece of old iron the ostrich swallowed  along with the rest.\"    \"Would you?\"    \"Yes; but now let's have all eyes, and no tongues, old chap.  We are  getting near where that bird got up off the nest.\"    \"If there was one.\"    \"If there was one,\" assented Emson.  \"Now then: think you're mushrooming  out in the old field at home, and see if you can't find the nest.  Move  off now a couple of hundred yards, and keep your eyes open.\"    Dyke followed out his brother's advice, and for the next hour they rode  over the ground here and there, to and fro, and across and across,  scanning the sandy depressions, till Emson suddenly drew rein, and  shouted to Dyke, who was a quarter of a mile away.    Dyke sent his cob off at a gallop and joined him.    \"Found it?\" he cried excitedly.    \"No, old fellow.  It's a failure this time.  Man wants sharp eyes to get  the better of an ostrich.  I made sure we should get it, but we're done.  We've been over the ground times enough, and it's of no use.\"    \"What! give up?\" cried Dyke merrily.  \"Didn't say we'd find it the first  time, but I mean to have that nest, if I try till to-morrow morning.\"    \"Well done, little un,\" shouted Emson, laughing.  \"That's the right  spirit, and I should like to have had the eggs; it would have started us  on again.  But I'm afraid we shall be wasting time, for we've lost count  now of the position where I saw the bird rise, and in this great waste  we may wander farther and farther away.\"    \"But we can tell by the hoof-marks where we've been.\"    \"Yes; and we've pretty well examined the ground.  I tell you what, we'll  bring the glass this evening, and lie down watching till dark.  We may  see a bird come to the nest, and then we'll mark down the place, and one  shall stop back, while the other rides forward, and number one can  telegraph which way to go with his arms.\"    \"I am disappointed,\" said Dyke, looking round about him over the level  plain.    \"So am I, old chap, but we won't be damped.  It's only putting it off.--  What are you looking at?\"    \"That,\" said Dyke; and, kicking his nag's sides, he went off at a canter  for a couple of hundred yards, and then sent up a joyous shout.    \"Why, he has found it!\" cried Emson; and galloping up, there sat Dyke,  flushed and happy, beside a depression in the sand, evidently scraped  out, and with the sand banked round to keep the eggs in their places.  There they all were, thirty-nine in number, neatly arranged with their  points downward, while outside were several more, and on Dyke bending  down, he found that they were all of a comfortable temperature; those  lying outside being cold, and apparently freshly laid.    \"Well, you have eyes, old chap!\" cried Emson, slapping his brother on  the shoulder, and then proceeding to loosen a coarsely meshed net from  behind his saddle.  \"Bravo, Dyke!  I told you the tide had turned.  We'll get these home at once and put them under one of our hens.  Shouldn't wonder if we get a nice little lot of chicks from these.\"    \"If we can get them home without breaking.\"    \"Oh, we'll do that,\""]]]
