Because it comes as a surprise, offers a  greater contrast with its surroundings, and suggests a spirit in wild  nature that seems to take thought of itself and to aspire to beautiful  forms.    The songs of caged birds are always disappointing, because such birds  have nothing but their musical qualities to recommend them to us. We  have separated them from that which gives quality and, meaning to  their songs. One recalls Emerson's lines:--      \"I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,    Singing at dawn on the alder bough;    I brought him home, in his nest, at even;    He sings the song, but it cheers not now,    For I did not bring home the river and sky;--    He sang to my ear,--they sang to my eye.\"    I have never yet seen a caged bird that I wanted,--at least, not on  account of its song,--nor a wild flower that I wished to transfer to  my garden. A caged skylark will sing its song sitting on a bit of  turf in the bottom of the cage; but you want to stop your ears, it is  so harsh and sibilant and penetrating. But up there against the  morning sky, and above the wide expanse of fields, what delight we  have in it! It is not the concord of sweet sounds: it is the soaring  spirit of gladness and ecstasy raining down upon us from \"heaven's  gate.\"    Then, if to the time and the place one could only add the association,  or hear the bird through the vista of the years, the song touched with  the magic of youthful memories! One season a friend in England sent me  a score of skylarks in a cage. I gave them their liberty in a field  near my place. They drifted away, and I never heard them or saw them  again. But one Sunday a Scotchman from a neighboring city called upon  me, and declared with visible excitement that on his way along the  road he had heard a skylark. He was not dreaming; he knew it was a  skylark, though he had not heard one since he had left the banks of  the Doon, a quarter of a century or more before. What pleasure it gave  him! How much more the song meant to him than it would have meant to  me! For the moment he was on his native heath again. Then I told him  about the larks I had liberated, and he seemed to enjoy it all over  again with renewed appreciation.    Many years ago some skylarks were liberated on Long Island, and they  became established there, and may now occasionally be heard in certain  localities. One summer day a friend of mine was out there observing  them; a lark was soaring and singing in the sky above him. An old  Irishman came along, and suddenly stopped as if transfixed to the  spot; a look of mingled delight and incredulity came into his face.  Was he indeed hearing the bird of his youth? He took off his hat,  turned his face skyward, and with moving lips and streaming eyes stood  a long time regarding the bird. \"Ah,\" my friend thought, \"if I could  only hear that song with his ears!\" How it brought back his youth and  all those long-gone days on his native hills!    The power of bird-songs over us is so much a matter of association  that every traveler to other countries finds the feathered songsters  of less merit than those he left behind. The stranger does not hear  the birds in the same receptive, uncritical frame of mind as does the  native; they are not in the same way the voices of the place and the  season. What music can there be in that long, piercing, far-heard note  of the first meadowlark in spring to any but a native, or in the  \"o-ka-lee\" of the red-shouldered starling as he rests upon the willows  in March? A stranger would probably recognize melody and a wild woodsy  quality in the flutings of the veery thrush; but how much more they  would mean to him after he had spent many successive Junes threading  our northern trout-streams and encamping on their banks! The veery  will come early in the morning, and again at sundown, and perch above  your tent, and blow his soft, reverberant note for many minutes at a  time. The strain repeats the echoes of the limpid stream in the halls  and corridors of the leafy woods.    While in England in 1882, I rushed about two or three counties in late  June and early July, bent on hearing the song of the nightingale, but  missed it by a few days, and in some cases, as it seemed, only by a  few hours. The nightingale seems to be wound up to go only so long, or  till about the middle of June, and it is only by a rare chance that  you hear one after that date. Then I came home to hear a nightingale  in song one winter morning in a friend's house in the city. It was a  curious let-down to my enthusiasm. A caged song in a city chamber in  broad daylight, in lieu of the wild, free song in the gloaming of an  English landscape! I closed my eyes, abstracted myself from my  surroundings, and tried my best to fancy myself listening to the  strain back there amid the scenes I had haunted about Haslemere and  Godalming, but with poor success, I suspect. The nightingale's song,  like the lark's, needs vista, needs all the accessories of time and  place. The song is not all in the singing, any more than the wit is  all in the saying. It is in the occasion, the surroundings, the spirit  of which it is the expression. My friend said that the bird did not  fully let itself out. Its song was a brilliant medley of notes,--no  theme that I could detect,--like the lark's song in this respect; all  the notes of the field and forest appeared to be the gift of this  bird, but what tone! what accent! like that of a great poet!    Nearly every May I am seized with an impulse to go back to the scenes  of my youth, and hear the bobolinks in the home meadows once more. I  am sure they sing there better than anywhere else. They probably drink  nothing but dew, and the dew distilled in those high pastoral regions  has surprising virtues. It gives a clear, full, vibrant quality to the  birds' voices that I have never heard elsewhere. The night of my  arrival, I leave my southern window open, so that the meadow chorus  may come pouring in before I am up in the morning. How it does  transport me athwart the years, and make me a boy again, sheltered by  the paternal wing! On one occasion, the third morning after my  arrival, a bobolink appeared with a new note in his song. The note  sounded like the word \"baby\" uttered with a peculiar, tender  resonance: but it was clearly an interpolation; it did not belong  there; it had no relation to the rest of the song. Yet the bird never  failed to utter it with the same joy and confidence as the rest of his  song. Maybe it was the beginning of a variation that will in time  result in an entirely new bobolink song.    On my last spring visit to my native hills, my attention was attracted  to another songster not seen or heard there in my youth, namely, the  prairie horned lark. Flocks of these birds used to be seen in some of  the Northern States in the late fall during their southern migrations;  but within the last twenty years they have become regular summer  residents in the hilly parts of many sections of New York and New  England. They are genuine skylarks, and lack only the powers of song  to make them as attractive as their famous cousins of Europe.    The larks are ground-birds when they perch, and sky-birds when they  sing; from the turf to the clouds--nothing between. Our horned lark  mounts upward on quivering wing in the true lark fashion, and, spread  out against the sky at an altitude of two or three hundred feet,  hovers and sings. The watcher and listener below holds him in his eye,  but the ear catches only a faint, broken, half-inarticulate note now  and then--mere splinters, as it were, of the song of the skylark. The  song of the latter is continuous, and is loud and humming; it is a  fountain of jubilant song up there in the sky: but our lark sings in  snatches; at each repetition of its notes it dips forward and downward  a few feet, and then rises again. One day I kept my eye upon one until  it had repeated its song one hundred and three times; then it closed  its wings, and dropped toward the earth like a plummet, as does its  European congener. While I was watching the bird, a bobolink flew over  my head, between me and the lark, and poured out his voluble and  copious strain. \"What a contrast,\" I thought, \"between the voice of  the spluttering, tongue-tied lark, and the free, liquid, and varied  song of the bobolink!\"    I have heard of a curious fact in the life-histories of these larks in  the West. A Michigan woman once wrote me that her brother, who was an  engineer on an express train that made daily trips between two Western  cities, reported that many birds were struck by the engine every day,  and killed--often as many as thirty on a trip of sixty miles. Birds of  many kinds were killed, but the most common was a bird that went in  flocks, the description of which answered to the horned lark. Since  then I have read in a Minnesota newspaper that many horned larks are  killed by railroad locomotives in that State. It was thought that the  birds sat behind the rails to get out of the wind, and on starting up  in front of the advancing train, were struck down by the engine. The  Michigan engineer referred to thought that the birds gathered upon the  track to earth their wings, or else to pick up the grain that leaks  out of the wheat-trains, and sows the track from Dakota to the  seaboard. Probably the wind which they might have to face in getting  up was the prime cause of their being struck. One does not think of  the locomotive as a bird-destroyer, though it is well known that many  of the smaller mammals often fall beneath it.    A very interesting feature of our bird-songs is the wing-song, or song  of ecstasy. It is not the gift of many of our birds. Indeed, less than  a dozen species are known to me as ever singing on the wing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#6)"],[1,"feathery population of the South Atlantic Ocean. The exportation of  guano alone should make my little country prosperous. Turtles visit the  island to deposit eggs, and at certain seasons the beach is literally  alive with them. The only drawback to my projected kingdom is the fact  that it has no good harbor and can be approached only when the sea is  calm.\"    As a matter of fact sometimes months pass before it is possible to  effect a landing.    Another asset of the island held out by the prospectus was its great  store of buried treasure. Before Harden-Hickey seized the island, this  treasure had made it known. This is the legend. In 1821 a great store  of gold and silver plate plundered from Peruvian churches had been  concealed on the islands by pirates near Sugar Loaf Hill, on the shore  of what is known as the Southwest Bay. Much of this plate came from  the cathedral at Lima, having been carried from there during the war  of independence when the Spanish residents fled the country. In their  eagerness to escape they put to sea in any ship that offered, and these  unarmed and unseaworthy vessels fell an easy prey to pirates. One of  these pirates on his death-bed, in gratitude to his former captain, told  him the secret of the treasure. In 1892 this captain was still living,  in Newcastle, England, and although his story bears a family resemblance  to every other story of buried treasure, there were added to the tale of  the pirate some corroborative details. These, in twelve years, induced  five different expeditions to visit the island. The two most important  were that of E. F. Knight and one from the Tyne in the bark _Aurea_.    In his \"Cruise of the _Alerte_,\" Knight gives a full description of the  island, and of his attempt to find the treasure. In this, a landslide  having covered the place where it was buried, he was unsuccessful.    But Knight's book is the only source of accurate information concerning  Trinidad, and in writing his prospectus it is evident that Harden-Hickey  was forced to borrow from it freely. Knight himself says that the most  minute and accurate description of Trinidad is to be found in the \"Frank  Mildmay\" of Captain Marryat. He found it so easy to identify each spot  mentioned in the novel that he believes the author of \"Midshipman Easy\"  himself touched there.    After seizing Trinidad, Harden-Hickey rounded the Cape and made north to  Japan, China, and India. In India he became interested in Buddhism, and  remained for over a year questioning the priests of that religion and  studying its tenets and history.    On his return to Paris, in 1890, he met Miss Annie Harper Flagler,  daughter of John H. Flagler. A year later, on St. Patrick's Day,  1891, at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, Miss Flagler became the  Baroness Harden-Hickey. The Rev. John Hall married them.    For the next two years Harden-Hickey lived in New York, but so quietly  that, except that he lived quietly, it is difficult to find out anything  concerning him. The man who, a few years before, had delighted Paris  with his daily feuilletons, with his duels, with his forty-two lawsuits,  who had been the master of revels in the Latin Quarter, in New York  lived almost as a recluse, writing a book on Buddhism. While he was in  New York I was a reporter on the _Evening Sun_, but I cannot recall ever  having read his name in the newspapers of that day, and I heard of him  only twice; once as giving an exhibition of his water-colors at the  American Art Galleries, and again as the author of a book I found in a  store in Twenty-second Street, just east of Broadway, then the home of  the Truth Seeker Publishing Company.    It was a grewsome compilation and had just appeared in print. It was  called \"Euthanasia, or the Ethics of Suicide.\" This book was an apology  or plea for self-destruction. In it the baron laid down those occasions  when he considered suicide pardonable, and when obligatory. To support  his arguments and to show that suicide was a noble act, he quoted Plato,  Cicero, Shakespeare, and even misquoted the Bible. He gave a list of  poisons, and the amount of each necessary to kill a human being. To show  how one can depart from life with the least pain, he illustrated the  text with most unpleasant pictures, drawn by himself.    The book showed how far Harden-Hickey had strayed from the teachings  of the Jesuit College at Namur, and of the Church that had made him  \"noble.\"    All of these two years had not been spent only in New York.  Harden-Hickey made excursions to California, to Mexico, and to Texas,  and in each of these places bought cattle ranches and mines. The money  to pay for these investments came from his father-in-law. But not  directly. Whenever he wanted money he asked his wife, or De la  Boissiere, who was a friend also of Flagler, to obtain it for him.    His attitude toward his father-in-law is difficult to explain. It is not  apparent that Flagler ever did anything which could justly offend him;  indeed, he always seems to have spoken of his son-in-law with tolerance,  and often with awe, as one would speak of a clever, wayward child. But  Harden-Hickey chose to regard Flagler as his enemy, as a sordid man  of business who could not understand the feelings and aspirations of a  genius and a gentleman.    Before Harden-Hickey married, the misunderstanding between his wife's  father and himself began. Because he thought Harden-Hickey was marrying  his daughter for her money, Flagler opposed the union. Consequently,  Harden-Hickey married Miss Flagler without \"settlements,\" and for the  first few years supported her without aid from her father. But his  wife had been accustomed to a manner of living beyond the means of the  soldier of fortune, and soon his income, and then even his capital, was  exhausted. From her mother the baroness inherited a fortune. This was  in the hands of her father as executor. When his own money was gone,  Harden-Hickey endeavored to have the money belonging to his wife placed  to her credit, or to his. To this, it is said, Flagler, on the ground  that Harden-Hickey was not a man of business, while he was, objected,  and urged that he was, and that if it remained in his hands the money  would be better invested and better expended. It was the refusal of  Flagler to intrust Harden-Hickey with the care of his wife's money that  caused the breach between them.    As I have said, you cannot judge Harden-Hickey as you would a  contemporary. With the people among whom he was thrown, his ideas were  entirely out of joint. He should have lived in the days of \"The Three  Musketeers.\" People who looked upon him as working for his own hand  entirely misunderstood him. He was absolutely honest, and as absolutely  without a sense of humor. To him, to pay taxes, to pay grocers' bills,  to depend for protection upon a policeman, was intolerable. He lived  in a world of his own imagining. And one day, in order to make his  imaginings real, and to escape from his father-in-law's unromantic world  of Standard Oil and Florida hotels, in a proclamation to the powers  he announced himself as King James the First of the Principality of  Trinidad.    The proclamation failed to create a world crisis. Several of the powers  recognized his principality and his title; but, as a rule, people  laughed, wondered, and forgot. That the daughter of John Flagler was  to rule the new principality gave it a \"news interest,\" and for a few  Sundays in the supplements she was hailed as the \"American Queen.\"    When upon the subject of the new kingdom Flagler himself was  interviewed, he showed an open mind.    \"My son-in-law is a very determined man,\" he said; \"he will carry out  any scheme in which he is interested. Had he consulted me about this,  I would have been glad to have aided him with money or advice. My  son-in-law is an extremely well-read, refined, well-bred man. He does  not court publicity. While he was staying in my house he spent nearly  all the time in the library translating an Indian book on Buddhism. My  daughter has no ambition to be a queen or anything else than what she  is--an American girl. But my son-in-law means to carry on this Trinidad  scheme, and--he will.\"    From his father-in-law, at least, Harden-Hickey could not complain that  he had met with lack of sympathy.    The rest of America was amused; and after less than nine days,  indifferent. But Harden-Hickey, though unobtrusively, none the less  earnestly continued to play the part of king. His friend De la Boissiere  he appointed his Minister of Foreign Affairs, and established in a  Chancellery at 217 West Thirty-sixth Street, New York, and from there  was issued a sort of circular, or prospectus, written by the king, and  signed by \"Le Grand Chancelier, Secretaire d'Etat pour les Affaires  Etrangeres, M. le Comte de la Boissiere.\"    The document, written in French, announced that the new state would  be governed by a military dictatorship, that the royal standard was a  yellow triangle on a red ground, and that the arms of the principality  were \"d'Or chape de Gueules.\" It pointed out naively that those who  first settled on the island would be naturally the oldest inhabitants,  and hence would form the aristocracy. But only those who at home enjoyed  social position and some private fortune would be admitted into this  select circle.    For itself the state reserved a monopoly of the guano, of the turtles,  and of the buried treasure. And both to discover the treasure and to  encourage settlers to dig and so cultivate the soil, a percentage of the  treasure was promised to the one who found it.    Any one purchasing ten $200 bonds was entitled to a free passage to the  island, and after a year, should he so desire it, a return trip. The  hard work was to be performed by Chinese coolies, the aristocracy  existing beautifully, and, according to the prospectus, to enjoy _\"vie  d'un"]]]
