Now she was so  superstitious as to comply with their desires, and accordingly they slew  whom they pleased themselves. But the principal of those that were in  danger fled to Aristobulus, who persuaded his mother to spare the men on  account of their dignity, but to expel them out of the city, unless she  took them to be innocent; so they were suffered to go unpunished, and  were dispersed all over the country. But when Alexandra sent out her  army to Damascus, under pretense that Ptolemy was always oppressing  that city, she got possession of it; nor did it make any considerable  resistance. She also prevailed with Tigranes, king of Armenia, who lay  with his troops about Ptolemais, and besieged Cleopatra, 5 by agreements  and presents, to go away. Accordingly, Tigranes soon arose from  the siege, by reason of those domestic tumults which happened upon  Lucullus's expedition into Armenia.    4. In the mean time, Alexandra fell sick, and Aristobulus, her younger  son, took hold of this opportunity, with his domestics, of which he had  a great many, who were all of them his friends, on account of the warmth  of their youth, and got possession of all the fortresses. He also used  the sums of money he found in them to get together a number of mercenary  soldiers, and made himself king; and besides this, upon Hyrcanus's  complaint to his mother, she compassionated his case, and put  Aristobulus's wife and sons under restraint in Antonia, which was a  fortress that joined to the north part of the temple. It was, as I have  already said, of old called the Citadel; but afterwards got the name of  Antonia, when Antony was [lord of the East], just as the other cities,  Sebaste and Agrippias, had their names changed, and these given them  from Sebastus and Agrippa. But Alexandra died before she could punish  Aristobulus for his disinheriting his brother, after she had reigned  nine years.              CHAPTER 6.           When Hyrcanus Who Was Alexander's Heir, Receded From His       Claim To The Crown Aristobulus Is Made King; And Afterward       The Same Hyrcanus By The Means Of Antipater, Is Brought Back       By Abetas. At Last Pompey Is Made The Arbitrator Of The       Dispute Between The Brothers.    1. Now Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother  commit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power  and magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide  the dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted  Hyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus; but Hyrcanus, with those of his  party who staid with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the  hostages that might be for his preservation [which were Aristobulus's  wife, with her children]; but they came to an agreement before things  should come to extremities, that Aristobulus should be king, and  Hyrcanus should resign that up, but retain all the rest of his  dignities, as being the king's brother. Hereupon they were reconciled  to each other in the temple, and embraced one another in a very kind  manner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their  houses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired  to the house of Aristobulus.    2. Now those other people which were at variance with Aristobulus were  afraid upon his unexpected obtaining the government; and especially this  concerned Antipater 6 whom Aristobulus hated of old. He was by birth  an Idumean, and one of the principal of that nation, on account of his  ancestors and riches, and other authority to him belonging: he also  persuaded Hyrcanus to fly to Aretas, the king of Arabia, and to lay  claim to the kingdom; as also he persuaded Aretas to receive Hyrcanus,  and to bring him back to his kingdom: he also cast great reproaches upon  Aristobulus, as to his morals, and gave great commendations to Hyrcanus,  and exhorted Aretas to receive him, and told him how becoming a filing  it would be for him, who ruled so great a kingdom, to afford his  assistance to such as are injured; alleging that Hyrcanus was treated  unjustly, by being deprived of that dominion which belonged to him by  the prerogative of his birth. And when he had predisposed them both to  do what he would have them, he took Hyrcanus by night, and ran away from  the city, and, continuing his flight with great swiftness, he escaped to  the place called Petra, which is the royal seat of the king of Arabia,  where he put Hyrcanus into Aretas's hand; and by discoursing much with  him, and gaining upon him with many presents, he prevailed with him  to give him an army that might restore him to his kingdom. This  army consisted of fifty thousand footmen and horsemen, against which  Aristobulus was not able to make resistance, but was deserted in his  first onset, and was driven to Jerusalem; he also had been taken  at first by force, if Scaurus, the Roman general, had not come and  seasonably interposed himself, and raised the siege. This Scaurus was  sent into Syria from Armenia by Pompey the Great, when he fought against  Tigranes; so Scaurus came to Damascus, which had been lately taken by  Metellus and Lollius, and caused them to leave the place; and, upon his  hearing how the affairs of Judea stood, he made haste thither as to a  certain booty.    3. As soon, therefore, as he was come into the country, there  came ambassadors from both the brothers, each of them desiring his  assistance; but Aristobulus's three hundred talents had more weight with  him than the justice of the cause; which sum, when Scaurus had received,  he sent a herald to Hyrcanus and the Arabians, and threatened them with  the resentment of the Romans and of Pompey, unless they would raise  the siege. So Aretas was terrified, and retired out of Judea to  Philadelphia, as did Scaurus return to Damascus again; nor was  Aristobulus satisfied with escaping [out of his brother's hands,] but  gathered all his forces together, and pursued his enemies, and fought  them at a place called Papyron, and slew about six thousand of them,  and, together with them Antipater's brother Phalion.    4. When Hyrcanus and Antipater were thus deprived of their hopes from  the Arabians, they transferred the same to their adversaries; and  because Pompey had passed through Syria, and was come to Damascus, they  fled to him for assistance; and, without any bribes, they made the same  equitable pleas that they had used to Aretas, and besought him to hate  the violent behavior of Aristobulus, and to bestow the kingdom on him  to whom it justly belonged, both on account of his good character and  on account of his superiority in age. However, neither was Aristobulus  wanting to himself in this case, as relying on the bribes that Scaurus  had received: he was also there himself, and adorned himself after  a manner the most agreeable to royalty that he was able. But he soon  thought it beneath him to come in such a servile manner, and could not  endure to serve his own ends in a way so much more abject than he was  used to; so he departed from Diospolis.    5. At this his behavior Pompey had great indignation; Hyrcanus also and  his friends made great intercessions to Pompey; so he took not only his  Roman forces, but many of his Syrian auxiliaries, and marched against  Aristobulus. But when he had passed by Pella and Scythopolis, and was  come to Corea, where you enter into the country of Judea, when you go  up to it through the Mediterranean parts, he heard that Aristobulus was  fled to Alexandrium, which is a strong hold fortified with the utmost  magnificence, and situated upon a high mountain; and he sent to him, and  commanded him to come down. Now his inclination was to try his fortune  in a battle, since he was called in such an imperious manner, rather  than to comply with that call. However, he saw the multitude were in  great fear, and his friends exhorted him to consider what the power of  the Romans was, and how it was irresistible; so he complied with their  advice, and came down to Pompey; and when he had made a long apology for  himself, and for the justness of his cause in taking the government,  he returned to the fortress. And when his brother invited him again [to  plead his cause], he came down and spake about the justice of it, and  then went away without any hinderance from Pompey; so he was between  hope and fear. And when he came down, it was to prevail with Pompey to  allow him the government entirely; and when he went up to the citadel,  it was that he might not appear to debase himself too low. However,  Pompey commanded him to give up his fortified places, and forced him to  write to every one of their governors to yield them up; they having  had this charge given them, to obey no letters but what were of his  own hand-writing. Accordingly he did what he was ordered to do; but had  still an indignation at what was done, and retired to Jerusalem, and  prepared to fight with Pompey.    6. But Pompey did not give him time to make any preparations [for a  siege], but followed him at his heels; he was also obliged to make haste  in his attempt, by the death of Mithridates, of which he was informed  about Jericho. Now here is the most fruitful country of Judea, which  bears a vast number of palm trees 7 besides the balsam tree, whose  sprouts they cut with sharp stones, and at the incisions they gather the  juice, which drops down like tears. So Pompey pitched his camp in that  place one night, and then hasted away the next morning to Jerusalem; but  Aristobulus was so affrighted at his approach, that he came and met him  by way of supplication. He also promised him money, and that he would  deliver up both himself and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#6)"],[1,"an angle of the temple of Luna,--a thing  unparalleled, because of the late autumn. A certain Cotta, too, who  had told this, added, while telling it, that the priests of that temple  prophesied the fall of the city or, at least, the ruin of a great  house,--ruin to be averted only by uncommon sacrifices.\"    Aulus, when he had heard the narrative, expressed the opinion that such  signs should not be neglected; that the gods might be angered by an  over-measure of wickedness. In this there was nothing wonderful; and in  such an event expiatory sacrifices were perfectly in order.    \"Thy house, Plautius, is not too large,\" answered Petronius, \"though  a great man lives in it. Mine is indeed too large for such a wretched  owner, though equally small. But if it is a question of the ruin of  something as great, for example, as the domus transitoria, would it be  worth while for us to bring offerings to avert that ruin?\"    Plautius did not answer that question,--a carefulness which touched even  Petronius somewhat, for, with all his inability to feel the difference  between good and evil, he had never been an informer; and it was  possible to talk with him in perfect safety. He changed the conversation  again, therefore, and began to praise Plautius's dwelling and the good  taste which reigned in the house.    \"It is an ancient seat,\" said Plautius, \"in which nothing has been  changed since I inherited it.\"    After the curtain was pushed aside which divided the atrium from the  tablinum, the house was open from end to end, so that through the  tablinum and the following peristyle and the hall lying beyond it which  was called the oecus, the glance extended to the garden, which seemed  from a distance like a bright image set in a dark frame. Joyous,  childlike laughter came from it to the atrium.    \"Oh, general!\" said Petronius, \"permit us to listen from near by to that  glad laughter which is of a kind heard so rarely in these days.\"    \"Willingly,\" answered Plautius, rising; \"that is my little Aulus and  Lygia, playing ball. But as to laughter, I think, Petronius, that our  whole life is spent in it.\"    \"Life deserves laughter, hence people laugh at it,\" answered Petronius,  \"but laughter here has another sound.\"    \"Petronius does not laugh for days in succession,\" said Vinicius; \"but  then he laughs entire nights.\"    Thus conversing, they passed through the length of the house and reached  the garden, where Lygia and little Aulus were playing with balls, which  slaves, appointed to that game exclusively and called spheristae, picked  up and placed in their hands. Petronius cast a quick passing glance at  Lygia; little Aulus, seeing Vinicius, ran to greet him; but the young  tribune, going forward, bent his head before the beautiful maiden, who  stood with a ball in her hand, her hair blown apart a little. She was  somewhat out of breath, and flushed.    In the garden triclinium, shaded by ivy, grapes, and woodbine, sat  Pomponia Graecina; hence they went to salute her. She was known to  Petronius, though he did not visit Plautius, for he had seen her at the  house of Antistia, the daughter of Rubelius Plautus, and besides at the  house of Seneca and Polion. He could not resist a certain admiration  with which he was filled by her face, pensive but mild, by the dignity  of her bearing, by her movements, by her words. Pomponia disturbed his  understanding of women to such a degree that that man, corrupted to the  marrow of his bones, and self-confident as no one in Rome, not only felt  for her a kind of esteem, but even lost his previous self-confidence.  And now, thanking her for her care of Vinicius, he thrust in, as it were  involuntarily, \"domina,\" which never occurred to him when speaking, for  example, to Calvia Crispinilla, Scribonia, Veleria, Solina, and other  women of high society. After he had greeted her and returned thanks, he  began to complain that he saw her so rarely, that it was not possible to  meet her either in the Circus or the Amphitheatre; to which she answered  calmly, laying her hand on the hand of her husband:    \"We are growing old, and love our domestic quiet more and more, both of  us.\"    Petronius wished to oppose; but Aulus Plautius added in his hissing  voice,--\"And we feel stranger and stranger among people who give Greek  names to our Roman divinities.\"    \"The gods have become for some time mere figures of rhetoric,\" replied  Petronius, carelessly. \"But since Greek rhetoricians taught us, it is  easier for me even to say Hera than Juno.\"    He turned his eyes then to Pomponia, as if to signify that in presence  of her no other divinity could come to his mind: and then he began to  contradict what she had said touching old age.    \"People grow old quickly, it is true; but there are some who live  another life entirely, and there are faces moreover which Saturn seems  to forget.\"    Petronius said this with a certain sincerity even, for Pomponia Graecina,  though descending from the midday of life, had preserved an uncommon  freshness of face; and since she had a small head and delicate features,  she produced at times, despite her dark robes, despite her solemnity and  sadness, the impression of a woman quite young.    Meanwhile little Aulus, who had become uncommonly friendly with Vinicius  during his former stay in the house, approached the young man and  entreated him to play ball. Lygia herself entered the triclinium after  the little boy. Under the climbing ivy, with the light quivering on her  face, she seemed to Petronius more beautiful than at the first glance,  and really like some nymph. As he had not spoken to her thus far,  he rose, inclined his head, and, instead of the usual expressions of  greeting, quoted the words with which Ulysses greeted Nausikaa,--    \"I supplicate thee, O queen, whether thou art some goddess or a mortal!  If thou art one of the daughters of men who dwell on earth, thrice  blessed are thy father and thy lady mother, and thrice blessed thy  brethren.\"    The exquisite politeness of this man of the world pleased even Pomponia.  As to Lygia, she listened, confused and flushed, without boldness to  raise her eyes. But a wayward smile began to quiver at the corners of  her lips, and on her face a struggle was evident between the timidity  of a maiden and the wish to answer; but clearly the wish was victorious,  for, looking quickly at Petronius, she answered him all at once with the  words of that same Nausikaa, quoting them at one breath, and a little  like a lesson learned,--    \"Stranger, thou seemest no evil man nor foolish.\"    Then she turned and ran out as a frightened bird runs.    This time the turn for astonishment came to Petronius, for he had not  expected to hear verses of Homer from the lips of a maiden of whose  barbarian extraction he had heard previously from Vinicius. Hence he  looked with an inquiring glance at Pomponia; but she could not give  him an answer, for she was looking at that moment, with a smile, at the  pride reflected on the face of her husband.    He was not able to conceal that pride. First, he had become attached  to Lygia as to his own daughter; and second, in spite of his old Roman  prejudices, which commanded him to thunder against Greek and the spread  of the language, he considered it as the summit of social polish. He  himself had never been able to learn it well; over this he suffered in  secret. He was glad, therefore, that an answer was given in the language  and poetry of Homer to this exquisite man both of fashion and letters,  who was ready to consider Plautius's house as barbarian.    \"We have in the house a pedagogue, a Greek,\" said he, turning to  Petronius, \"who teaches our boy, and the maiden overhears the lessons.  She is a wagtail yet, but a dear one, to which we have both grown  attached.\"    Petronius looked through the branches of woodbine into the garden, and  at the three persons who were playing there. Vinicius had thrown aside  his toga, and, wearing only his tunic, was striking the ball, which  Lygia, standing opposite, with raised arms was trying to catch. The  maiden did not make a great impression on Petronius at the first glance;  she seemed to him too slender. But from the moment when he saw her more  nearly in the triclinium he thought to himself that Aurora might look  like her; and as a judge he understood that in her there was something  uncommon. He considered everything and estimated everything; hence her  face, rosy and clear, her fresh lips, as if set for a kiss, her eyes  blue as the azure of the sea, the alabaster whiteness of her forehead,  the wealth of her dark hair, with the reflection of amber or Corinthian  bronze gleaming in its folds, her slender neck, the divine slope of her  shoulders, the whole posture, flexible, slender, young with the youth of  May and of freshly opened flowers. The artist was roused in him, and the  worshipper of beauty, who felt that beneath a statue of that maiden one  might write \"Spring.\" All at once he remembered Chrysothemis, and pure  laughter seized him. Chrysothemis seemed to him, with golden powder on  her hair and darkened brows, to be fabulously faded,--something in  the nature of a yellowed rose-tree shedding its leaves. But still Rome  envied him that Chrysothemis. Then he recalled Poppaea; and that most  famous Poppaea also seemed to him soulless, a waxen mask. In that maiden  with Tanagrian outlines there was not only spring, but a radiant soul,  which shone through her rosy body as a flame through a lamp.    \"Vinicius is right,\" thought he, \"and my Chrysothemis is old, old!--as  Troy!\"    Then he turned to Pomponia Graecina, and, pointing to the garden,  said,--\"I understand now, domina, why thou and thy husband prefer this  house to the Circus and to feasts on the Palatine.\"    \"Yes,\" answered she, turning her eyes in the direction of little Aulus  and Lygia.    But the old general began to relate the history"]]]
