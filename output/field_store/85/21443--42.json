[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#6)"],[1,"the  Legislature to pass the law, and places it distinctly upon the  interest and convenience of the white population--excluding the  inference that it might have been intended in any degree for the  benefit of the other.    And in the act of 1784, by which the issue of slaves, born after the  time therein mentioned, were to be free at a certain age, the section  is again introduced by a preamble assigning similar motive for the  act. It is in these words:    \"Whereas sound policy requires that the abolition of slavery should be  effected as soon as may be consistent with the rights of individuals,  and the public safety and welfare\"--showing that the right of property  in the master was to be protected, and that the measure was one of  policy, and to prevent the injury and inconvenience, to the whites, of  a slave population in the State.    And still further pursuing its legislation, we find that in the same  statute passed in 1774, which prohibited the further importation of  slaves into the State, there is also a provision by which any negro,  Indian, or mulatto servant, who was found wandering out of the town or  place to which he belonged, without a written pass such as is therein  described, was made liable to be seized by any one, and taken before  the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master--who  was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a  subsequent section of the same law provides, that if any free negro  shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken  up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full  operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and  was not repealed till 1797. So that up to that time free negroes and  mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police  regulations established by the laws of the State.    And again, in 1833, Connecticut passed another law, which made it  penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the  instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the  State or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution, or  board or harbor for that purpose, any such person, without the  previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in  which such school or institution might be.    And it appears by the case of Crandall _v._ The State, reported in 10  Conn. Rep., 340, that upon an information filed against Prudence  Crandall for a violation of this law, one of the points raised in the  defence was, that the law was a violation of the Constitution of the  United States; and that the persons instructed, although of the  African race, were citizens of other States, and therefore entitled to  the rights and privileges of citizens in the State of Connecticut. But  Chief Justice Dagget, before whom the case was tried, held, that  persons of that description were not citizens of a State, within the  meaning of the word citizen in the Constitution of the United States,  and were not therefore entitled to the privileges and immunities of  citizens in other States.    The case was carried up to the Supreme Court of Errors of the State,  and the question fully argued there. But the case went off upon  another point, and no opinion was expressed on this question.    We have made this particular examination into the legislative and  judicial action of Connecticut, because, from the early hostility it  displayed to the slave trade on the coast of Africa, we may expect to  find the laws of that State as lenient and favorable to the subject  race as those of any other State in the Union; and if we find that at  the time the Constitution was adopted, they were not even there raised  to the rank of citizens, but were still held and treated as property,  and the laws relating to them passed with reference altogether to the  interest and convenience of the white race, we shall hardly find them  elevated to a higher rank anywhere else.    A brief notice of the laws of two other States, and we shall pass on  to other considerations.    By the laws of New Hampshire, collected and finally passed in 1815, no  one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State, but free  white citizens; and the same provision is found in a subsequent  collection of the laws, made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark  the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded,  because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the  community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born  in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of  the citizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and  laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the  sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and  defend it.    Again, in 1822, Rhode Island, in its revised code, passed a law  forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage,  from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or  mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all  such marriages absolutely null and void; and the same law was again  re-enacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the  last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and  degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.    It would be impossible to enumerate and compress in the space usually  allotted to an opinion of a court, the various laws, marking the  condition of this race, which were passed from time to time after the  Revolution, and before and since the adoption of the Constitution of  the United States. In addition to those already referred to, it is  sufficient to say, that Chancellor Kent, whose accuracy and research  no one will question, states in the sixth edition of his Commentaries,  (published in 1848, 2 vol., 258, note _b_,) that in no part of the  country except Maine, did the African race, in point of fact,  participate equally with the whites in the exercise of civil and  political rights.    The legislation of the States therefore shows, in a manner not to be  mistaken, the inferior and subject condition of that race at the time  the Constitution was adopted, and long afterwards, throughout the  thirteen States by which that instrument was framed; and it is hardly  consistent with the respect due to these States, to suppose that they  regarded at that time, as fellow-citizens and members of the  sovereignty, a class of beings whom they had thus stigmatized; whom,  as we are bound, out of respect to the State sovereignties, to assume  they had deemed it just and necessary thus to stigmatize, and upon  whom they had impressed such deep and enduring marks of inferiority  and degradation; or, that when they met in convention to form the  Constitution, they looked upon them as a portion of their  constituents, or designed to include them in the provisions so  carefully inserted for the security and protection of the liberties  and rights of their citizens. It cannot be supposed that they intended  to secure to them rights, and privileges, and rank, in the new  political body throughout the Union, which every one of them denied  within the limits of its own dominion. More especially, it cannot be  believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included  in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which  might compel them to receive them in that character from another  State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges  and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of  the special laws and from the police regulations which they  considered to be necessary for their own safety. It would give to  persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one  State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they  pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without  obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where  they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation,  unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man  would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech  in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens  might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to  keep and carry arms wherever they went. And all of this would be done  in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and  slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among  them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.    It is impossible, it would seem, to believe that the great men of the  slaveholding States, who took so large a share in framing the  Constitution of the United States, and exercised so much influence in  procuring its adoption, could have been so forgetful or regardless of  their own safety and the safety of those who trusted and confided in  them.    Besides, this want of foresight and care would have been utterly  inconsistent with the caution displayed in providing for the admission  of new members into this political family. For, when they gave to the  citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in  the several States, they at the same time took from the several States  the power of naturalization, and confined that power exclusively to  the Federal Government. No State was willing to permit another State  to determine who should or should not be admitted as one of its  citizens, and entitled to demand equal rights and privileges with  their own people, within their own territories. The right of  naturalization was therefore, with one accord, surrendered by the  States, and confided to the Federal Government. And this power granted  to Congress to establish an uniform rule of _naturalization_ is, by  the well-understood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#6)"],[1,"that matter is a phase of  error, and that neither one really exists, since God is  Truth, and All-in-all. Christ's Sermon on the Mount,  in its direct application to human needs, confirms this [10]  conclusion.    Science, understood, translates matter into Mind,  rejects all other theories of causation, restores the spir-  itual and original meaning of the Scriptures, and ex-  plains the teachings and life of our Lord. It is religion's [15]  \"new tongue,\" with \"signs following,\" spoken of by  St. Mark. It gives God's infinite meaning to mankind,  healing the sick, casting out evil, and raising the spirit-  ually dead. Christianity is Christlike only as it re-  iterates the word, repeats the works, and manifests the [20]  spirit of Christ.    Jesus' only medicine was omnipotent and omniscient  Mind. As _omni_ is from the Latin word meaning _all_,  this medicine is all-power; and omniscience means as  well, all-science. The sick are more deplorably situated [25]  than the sinful, if the sick cannot trust God for help and  the sinful can. If God created drugs good, they cannot be  harmful; if He could create them otherwise, then they  are bad and unfit for man; and if He created drugs for  healing the sick, why did not Jesus employ them and [30]  recommend them for that purpose?    No human hypotheses, whether in philosophy, medi-    [Page 26.]    cine, or religion, can survive the wreck of time; but [1]  whatever is of God, hath life abiding in it, and ulti-  mately will be known as self-evident truth, as demonstra-  ble as mathematics. Each successive period of progress  is a period more humane and spiritual. The only logical [5]  conclusion is that all is Mind and its manifestation, from  the rolling of worlds, in the most subtle ether, to a potato-  patch.    The agriculturist ponders the history of a seed, and  believes that his crops come from the seedling and the [10]  loam; even while the Scripture declares He made \"every  plant of the field before it was in the earth.\" The Scien-  tist asks, Whence came the first seed, and what made  the soil? Was it molecules, or material atoms? Whence  came the infinitesimals,--from infinite Mind, or from [15]  matter? If from matter, how did matter originate? Was  it self-existent? Matter is not intelligent, and thus able  to evolve or create itself: it is the very opposite of Spirit,  intelligent, self-creative, and infinite Mind. The belief  of mind in matter is pantheism. Natural history shows [20]  that neither a genus nor a species produces its opposite.  God is All, in all. What can be more than All? Noth-  ing: and this is just what I call matter, _nothing_. Spirit,  God, has no antecedent; and God's consequent is the  spiritual cosmos. The phrase, \"express image,\" in the [25]  common version of Hebrews i. 3, is, in the Greek Tes-  tament, _character_.    The Scriptures name God as good, and the Saxon  term for God is also good. From this premise comes  the logical conclusion that God is naturally and divinely [30]  infinite good. How, then, can this conclusion change,  or be changed, to mean that good is evil, or the creator    [Page 27.]    of evil? What can there be besides infinity? Nothing! [1]  Therefore the Science of good calls evil _nothing_. In  divine Science the terms God and good, as Spirit, are  synonymous. That God, good, creates evil, or aught  that can result in evil,--or that Spirit creates its oppo- [5]  site, named matter,--are conclusions that destroy their  premise and prove themselves invalid. Here is where  Christian Science sticks to its text, and other systems  of religion abandon their own logic. Here also is found  the pith of the basal statement, the cardinal point in [10]  Christian Science, that matter and evil (including all  inharmony, sin, disease, death) are _unreal_. Mortals  accept natural science, wherein no species ever pro-  duces its opposite. Then why not accept divine Sci-  ence on this ground? since the Scriptures maintain [15]  this fact by parable and proof, asking, \"Do men  gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\" \"Doth a  fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and  bitter?\"    According to reason and revelation, evil and matter [20]  are negation: for evil signifies the absence of good, God,  though God is ever present; and matter claims some-  thing besides God, when God is really _All_. Creation,  evolution, or manifestation,--being in and of Spirit,  Mind, and all that really is,--must be spiritual and [25]  mental. This is Science, and is susceptible of proof.    But, say you, is a stone spiritual?    To erring material sense, No! but to unerring spiritual  sense, it is a small manifestation of Mind, a type of spirit-  ual substance, \"the substance of things hoped for.\" [30]  Mortals can know a stone as substance, only by first ad-  mitting that it is substantial. Take away the mortal sense    [Page 28.]    of substance, and the stone itself would disappear, only [1]  to reappear in the spiritual sense thereof. Matter can  neither see, hear, feel, taste, nor smell; having no sen-  sation of its own. Perception by the five personal senses  is mental, and dependent on the beliefs that mortals [5]  entertain. Destroy the belief that you can walk, and  volition ceases; for muscles cannot move without mind.  Matter takes no cognizance of matter. In dreams, things  are only what mortal mind makes them; and the phe-  nomena of mortal life are as dreams; and this so-called [10]  life is a dream soon told. In proportion as mortals turn  from this mortal and material dream, to the true sense  of reality, everlasting Life will be found to be the only  Life. That death does not destroy the beliefs of the flesh,  our Master proved to his doubting disciple, Thomas. Also, [15]  he demonstrated that divine Science alone can overbear  materiality and mortality; and this great truth was shown  is by his ascension after death, whereby he arose above  the illusion of matter.    The First Commandment, \"Thou shalt have no other [20]  gods before me,\" suggests the inquiry, What meaneth  this Me,--Spirit, or matter? It certainly does not  signify a graven idol, and must mean Spirit. Then  the commandment means, Thou shalt recognize no  intelligence nor life in matter; and find neither pleasure [25]  nor pain therein. The Master's practical knowledge  of this grand verity, together with his divine Love,  healed the sick and raised the dead. He literally  annulled the claims of physique and of physical law,  by the superiority of the higher law; hence his decla- [30]  ration, \"These signs shall follow them that believe;...  if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;    [Page 29.]    they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" [1]    Do you believe his words? I do, and that his prom-  ise is perpetual. Had it been applicable only to his  immediate disciples, the pronoun would be _you_, not _them_. [5]  The purpose of his life-work touches universal human-  ity. At another time he prayed, not for the twelve  only, but \"for them also which shall believe on me through  their word.\"    The Christ-healing was practised even before the Christ- [10]  ian era; \"the Word was with God, and the Word was  God.\" There is, however, no analogy between Christian  Science and spiritualism, or between it and any specu-  lative theory.    In 1867, I taught the first student in Christian Science. [15]  Since that date I have known of but fourteen deaths  in the ranks of my about five thousand students. The  census since 1875 (the date of the first publication of  my work, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scrip-  tures\") shows that longevity has _increased_. Daily letters [20]  inform me that a perusal of my volume is healing the  writers of chronic and acute diseases that had defied medi-  cal skill.    Surely the people of the Occident know that esoteric  magic and Oriental barbarisms will neither flavor Chris- [25]  tianity nor advance health and length of days.    Miracles are no infraction of God's laws; on the  contrary, they fulfil His laws; for they are the signs fol-  lowing Christianity, whereby matter is proven power-  less and subordinate to Mind. Christians, like students [30]  in mathematics, should be working up to those higher  rules of Life which Jesus taught and proved. Do we    [Page 30.]    really understand the divine Principle of Christianity [1]  before we prove it, in at least some feeble demonstra-  tion thereof, according to Jesus' example in healing the  sick? Should we adopt the \"simple addition\" in Chris-  tian Science and doubt its higher rules, or despair of [5]  ultimately reaching them, even though failing at first to  demonstrate all the possibilities of Christianity?    St. John spiritually discerned and revealed the sum  total of transcendentalism. He saw the real earth and  heaven. They were spiritual, not material; and they [10]  were without pain, sin, or death. Death was not the  door to this heaven. The gates thereof he declared were  inlaid with pearl,--likening them to the priceless under-  standing of man's real existence, to be recognized here  and now. [15]    The great Way-shower illustrated Life unconfined, un-  contaminated, untrammelled, by matter. He proved the  superiority of Mind over the flesh, opened the door to  the captive, and enabled man to demonstrate the law of  Life, which St. Paul declares \"hath made me free from [20]  the law of sin and death.\"    The stale saying that Christian Science \"is neither  Christian nor science!\" is to-day the fossil of wisdom-  less wit, weakness, and superstition. \"The fool hath  said in his heart, There is no God.\" [25]    Take courage, dear reader, for any seeming mysti-  cism surrounding realism is explained in the Scripture,  \"There went up a mist from the earth [matter];\" and  the mist of materialism will vanish as we approach spirit-  uality, the realm of reality; cleanse our lives in Christ's [30]"]]]
