[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#6)"],[1," though why 'gardens' I don't  know.\"    I rather longed to say, \"Well, _I_ know\"; but there were so many things  about me which I did _not_ know, in spite of his assumptions, that I  thought it better to hold my tongue.    The road plunged at once into a beautiful wood spreading out on either  side, but obviously much further on the north side, where even the oaks  and sweet chestnuts were of a good growth; while the quicker-growing  trees (amongst which I thought the planes and sycamores too numerous)  were very big and fine-grown.    It was exceedingly pleasant in the dappled shadow, for the day was  growing as hot as need be, and the coolness and shade soothed my excited  mind into a condition of dreamy pleasure, so that I felt as if I should  like to go on for ever through that balmy freshness.  My companion seemed  to share in my feelings, and let the horse go slower and slower as he sat  inhaling the green forest scents, chief amongst which was the smell of  the trodden bracken near the wayside.    Romantic as this Kensington wood was, however, it was not lonely.  We  came on many groups both coming and going, or wandering in the edges of  the wood.  Amongst these were many children from six or eight years old  up to sixteen or seventeen.  They seemed to me to be especially fine  specimens of their race, and enjoying themselves to the utmost; some of  them were hanging about little tents pitched on the greensward, and by  some of these fires were burning, with pots hanging over them gipsy  fashion.  Dick explained to me that there were scattered houses in the  forest, and indeed we caught a glimpse of one or two.  He said they were  mostly quite small, such as used to be called cottages when there were  slaves in the land, but they were pleasant enough and fitting for the  wood.    \"They must be pretty well stocked with children,\" said I, pointing to the  many youngsters about the way.    \"O,\" said he, \"these children do not all come from the near houses, the  woodland houses, but from the country-side generally.  They often make up  parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in summer-time,  living in tents, as you see.  We rather encourage them to it; they learn  to do things for themselves, and get to notice the wild creatures; and,  you see, the less they stew inside houses the better for them.  Indeed, I  must tell you that many grown people will go to live in the forests  through the summer; though they for the most part go to the bigger ones,  like Windsor, or the Forest of Dean, or the northern wastes.  Apart from  the other pleasures of it, it gives them a little rough work, which I am  sorry to say is getting somewhat scarce for these last fifty years.\"    He broke off, and then said, \"I tell you all this, because I see that if  I talk I must be answering questions, which you are thinking, even if you  are not speaking them out; but my kinsman will tell you more about it.\"    I saw that I was likely to get out of my depth again, and so merely for  the sake of tiding over an awkwardness and to say something, I said--    \"Well, the youngsters here will be all the fresher for school when the  summer gets over and they have to go back again.\"    \"School?\" he said; \"yes, what do you mean by that word?  I don't see how  it can have anything to do with children.  We talk, indeed, of a school  of herring, and a school of painting, and in the former sense we might  talk of a school of children--but otherwise,\" said he, laughing, \"I must  own myself beaten.\"    Hang it! thought I, I can't open my mouth without digging up some new  complexity.  I wouldn't try to set my friend right in his etymology; and  I thought I had best say nothing about the boy-farms which I had been  used to call schools, as I saw pretty clearly that they had disappeared;  so I said after a little fumbling, \"I was using the word in the sense of  a system of education.\"    \"Education?\" said he, meditatively, \"I know enough Latin to know that the  word must come from _educere_, to lead out; and I have heard it used; but  I have never met anybody who could give me a clear explanation of what it  means.\"    You may imagine how my new friends fell in my esteem when I heard this  frank avowal; and I said, rather contemptuously, \"Well, education means a  system of teaching young people.\"    \"Why not old people also?\" said he with a twinkle in his eye.  \"But,\" he  went on, \"I can assure you our children learn, whether they go through a  'system of teaching' or not.  Why, you will not find one of these  children about here, boy or girl, who cannot swim; and every one of them  has been used to tumbling about the little forest ponies--there's one of  them now!  They all of them know how to cook; the bigger lads can mow;  many can thatch and do odd jobs at carpentering; or they know how to keep  shop.  I can tell you they know plenty of things.\"    \"Yes, but their mental education, the teaching of their minds,\" said I,  kindly translating my phrase.    \"Guest,\" said he, \"perhaps you have not learned to do these things I have  been speaking about; and if that's the case, don't you run away with the  idea that it doesn't take some skill to do them, and doesn't give plenty  of work for one's mind: you would change your opinion if you saw a  Dorsetshire lad thatching, for instance.  But, however, I understand you  to be speaking of book-learning; and as to that, it is a simple affair.  Most children, seeing books lying about, manage to read by the time they  are four years old; though I am told it has not always been so.  As to  writing, we do not encourage them to scrawl too early (though scrawl a  little they will), because it gets them into a habit of ugly writing; and  what's the use of a lot of ugly writing being done, when rough printing  can be done so easily.  You understand that handsome writing we like, and  many people will write their books out when they make them, or get them  written; I mean books of which only a few copies are needed--poems, and  such like, you know.  However, I am wandering from my lambs; but you must  excuse me, for I am interested in this matter of writing, being myself a  fair-writer.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"about the children; when they know how to read and  write, don't they learn something else--languages, for instance?\"    \"Of course,\" he said; \"sometimes even before they can read, they can talk  French, which is the nearest language talked on the other side of the  water; and they soon get to know German also, which is talked by a huge  number of communes and colleges on the mainland.  These are the principal  languages we speak in these islands, along with English or Welsh, or  Irish, which is another form of Welsh; and children pick them up very  quickly, because their elders all know them; and besides our guests from  over sea often bring their children with them, and the little ones get  together, and rub their speech into one another.\"    \"And the older languages?\" said I.    \"O, yes,\" said he, \"they mostly learn Latin and Greek along with the  modern ones, when they do anything more than merely pick up the latter.\"    \"And history?\" said I; \"how do you teach history?\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"when a person can read, of course he reads what he  likes to; and he can easily get someone to tell him what are the best  books to read on such or such a subject, or to explain what he doesn't  understand in the books when he is reading them.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"what else do they learn?  I suppose they don't all learn  history?\"    \"No, no,\" said he; \"some don't care about it; in fact, I don't think many  do.  I have heard my great-grandfather say that it is mostly in periods  of turmoil and strife and confusion that people care much about history;  and you know,\" said my friend, with an amiable smile, \"we are not like  that now.  No; many people study facts about the make of things and the  matters of cause and effect, so that knowledge increases on us, if that  be good; and some, as you heard about friend Bob yonder, will spend time  over mathematics.  'Tis no use forcing people's tastes.\"    Said I: \"But you don't mean that children learn all these things?\"    Said he: \"That depends on what you mean by children; and also you must  remember how much they differ.  As a rule, they don't do much reading,  except for a few story-books, till they are about fifteen years old; we  don't encourage early bookishness: though you will find some children who  _will_ take to books very early; which perhaps is not good for them; but  it's no use thwarting them; and very often it doesn't last long with  them, and they find their level before they are twenty years old.  You  see, children are mostly given to imitating their elders, and when they  see most people about them engaged in genuinely amusing work, like house-  building and street-paving, and gardening, and the like, that is what  they want to be doing; so I don't think we need fear having too many book-  learned men.\"    What could I say?  I sat and held my peace, for fear of fresh  entanglements.  Besides, I was using my eyes with all my might, wondering  as the old horse jogged on, when I should come into London proper, and  what it would be like now.    But my companion couldn't let his subject quite drop, and went on  meditatively:    \"After all, I don't know that it does them much harm, even if they do  grow up book-students.  Such people as that, 'tis a great pleasure seeing  them so happy over work which is not much sought for.  And besides, these  students are generally such pleasant people; so kind and sweet tempered;  so humble, and at the same time so anxious to teach everybody all that  they know.  Really, I like those that I have met prodigiously.\"    This seemed to me such very queer talk that I was on the point of asking  him another question; when just as we came to the top of a rising ground,  down a long glade of the wood on my right I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32653"],[0,"A Review of the Frogs of the Hyla bistincta Group (#6)"],[1,", shallowly notched posteriorly, and free for  about one-fourth its length; vomerine teeth 5-5, situated on rounded  ridges between small inner nares; no vocal slits.    Color (in alcohol) dull olive-green on dorsal surfaces of head, body,  and limbs; flanks dull olive-green with scattered cream-colored spots;  posterior surfaces of thighs grayish brown with faint creamy mottling;  chin gray with cream-colored spots; belly creamy yellow, suffused with  gray posteriorly; undersides of feet and webbing gray; anal stripe  faint, pale cream-color.    _Variation._--The only other known specimen (MNHN 6331) is a female  having a snout-vent length of 53.7 mm. and resembling the specimen  described above in most details of morphology. In MNHN 6331 the  tympanum is completely concealed, and the 8-7 vomerine teeth are  arranged in two irregular rows. The female has more cream-colored  mottling on the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs and more  distinct mottling on the throat than the male described above.    _Remarks._--The systematic status of _Cauphias crassus_ Brocchi has  been in doubt since the time of the original description. Brocchi  (1877:130) stated: \"Les dernieres phalanges sont obtuses, tronques a  leur extremite anterieure.\" Brocchi placed the species in his genus  _Cauphias_ (type species, _C. guatemalensis_), which he considered to  be related to _Hylodes_ ( = _Eleutherodactylus_ in the sense used by  Brocchi); he thereby placed _Cauphias_ in his Hylodidae ( =  Leptodactylidae, in part). This idea of relationships was perpetuated  by Barbour (1927:96), who reported on the second known specimen of  _Cauphias guatemalensis_ and stated: \"When I dissected the sternum I  was at once struck by its similarity to Noble's figures of  transitional types between arciferal and firmisternal forms. The  _Cauphias_ sternum recalls some of his figures for _Sminthillus_ and  _Eleutherodactylus_. This genus is probably most closely related to  the latter and has probably become highly modified to meet some  peculiar environmental condition or on account of some specialized  habits as yet unknown.\" Kellogg (1932:118) placed _Cauphias_ in the  Leptodactylidae and stated that the terminal phalanges are T-shaped.  Hartweg (1941:1) considered _Plectrohyla_ to be the correct generic  name for _Cauphias guatemalensis_; he thereby relegated _Cauphias_ to  the synonomy of _Plectrohyla_. Hartweg (1941:9) further showed that  the terminal phalanges of _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ were not  T-shaped and that intercalary cartilages were present. Thus, he  correctly concluded that _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ (and _P. crassa_  by implication) was a member of the family Hylidae. Stuart (1942:6)  followed Hartweg's allocations and further suggested that _Plectrohyla  crassa_ might be the same species as _Hyla robustofemora_ Taylor. In  his description of _H. robustofemora_ Taylor (1940:392), who had not  examined the type of _Cauphias crassus_, stated that were it not for  the statements of Brocchi and Kellogg that _C. crassus_ has T-shaped  terminal phalanges, \"I might suspect I had before me a specimen of  _Cauphias_ closely related to _crassum_.\"    I have compared the type of _Cauphias crassus_ with that of _Hyla  robustofemora_. With the exception of the minor differences mentioned  in the preceding section on variation, the specimens are alike,  leaving little doubt that they represent the same species. The  statements of Brocchi and Kellogg to the contrary, the type of  _Cauphias crassus_ possesses intercalary cartilages between the  penultimate and terminal phalanges; the latter are not T-shaped, but  as in the type of _Hyla robustofemora_, resemble those typical of  _Hyla_. On the basis of the morphological characters, as pointed out  for _Hyla robustofemora_ by Taylor (1940:392), _Hyla crassa_ is a  member of the _Hyla bistincta_ group.    _Distribution._--This species is definitely known only from a small  stream at an elevation of 2300 meters in the mountains of central  Oaxaca (Fig. 4).    Specimens examined.--OAXACA: Cerro San Felipe, UIMNH 25050. \"Mexico,\"  MNHN 6331.          RELATIONSHIPS      The evolutionary trend in the members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group  is towards aquatic habits. _Hyla bistincta_, the least specialized  species in the group, has relatively short fingers, webbing between  the fingers, a truncate, high snout, and relatively large subarticular  and supernumerary tubercles. _Hyla charadricola_ resembles _bistincta_  in having relatively short fingers, a slight amount of webbing, and a  truncate snout. Apparently these two species are more closely related  to one another than either is to the other species in the group. _Hyla  robertsorum_, _pachyderma_, and _crassa_ are the most aquatic members  of the group. These species are closely related, possibly conspecific.  All have round, sloping snouts, robust forearms, long, unwebbed  fingers, and large webbed feet. Both _H. pachyderma_ and _H. crassa_  seem to be advanced beyond _H. robertsorum_. If small nuptial spines,  moderately webbed feet, and absence of a well-defined thoracic fold  are considered to be less advanced than large nuptial spines and a  strong thoracic fold, as in _H. pachyderma_, or fully webbed feet, as  in _H. crassa_, then _H. robertsorum_ must be considered to be less  advanced than _H. pachyderma_ or _H. crassa_.    Members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group inhabit mountain streams. The  frogs can be found along these streams throughout the year. Since in  most stream-breeding hylids there is no migration to breeding sites,  the breeding call does not function to attract females to the breeding  site. Apparently voices are lacking in all members of the _Hyla  bistincta_ group, except in _Hyla bistincta_. The presence of vocal  slits and the ability to call further indicate that _Hyla bistincta_  is the primitive member of this group.    Members of the _Hyla bistincta_ group and the species of _Plectrohyla_  closely resemble each other in osteology and body form of the adults  and in structure of the tadpoles. This resemblance suggests a close  relationship between the two groups. _Plectrohyla_ apparently evolved  from an ancestral stock resembling the extant _Hyla bistincta_.  Probably this stock gave rise independently to _Plectrohyla_ and  to the _Hyla robertsorum-pachyderma-crassa_ complex. In the former  the voice was retained, and a projecting prepollex spine developed,  whereas in the latter the voice was lost, and the prepollex spine  did not project. _Plectrohyla_ lives in mountain streams in the  Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands; the _Hyla robertsorum-pachyderma-crassa_  complex inhabits similar environments in the Sierra Madre Oriental in  Mexico. _Hyla charadricola_ also lives in the Sierra Madre Oriental,  whereas _Hyla bistincta_ is widespread in the mountains of Mexico  southeastward to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
