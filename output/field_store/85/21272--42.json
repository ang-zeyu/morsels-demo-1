Among forms which cannot be included under the general title of  chansons, are those in dialogue derived from the Provencal  literature; in the _tenson_ or _debat_ the two interlocutors put forth  their opinions on what theme they may please; in the _jeu parti_ one  of the imagined disputants proposes two contrary solutions of some  poetical or amorous question, and defends whichever solution his  associate refuses to accept; the earliest _jeu parti_, attributed  to Gace Brule and Count Geoffroi of Brittany, belongs to the second  half of the twelfth century. The _serventois_ were historical poems,  and among them songs of the crusades, or moral, or religious, or  satirical pieces, directed against woman and the worship of woman.  To these various species we should add the songs in honour of the  saints, the sorrows of the Virgin uttered at the foot of the cross,  and other devout lyrics which lie outside the _poesie courtoise_.  With the close of the thirteenth century this fashion of artificial  love-lyric ceased: a change passed over the modes of thought and  feeling in aristocratic society, and other forms took the place of  those found in the _poesie courtoise_.      II  FABLES, AND RENARD THE FOX    The desire of ecclesiastical writers in the Middle Ages to give  prominence to that part of classical literature which seemed best  suited to the purpose of edification caused the fables of Phaedrus  and Avianus to be regarded with special honour. Various renderings  from the thirteenth century onwards were made under the title of  _Isopets_,[1] a name appropriated to collections of fables whether  derived from AEsop or from other sources. The twelfth-century fables  in verse of Marie de France, founded on an English collection, include  apologues derived not only from classical authors but from the tales  of popular tradition. A great collection made about 1450 by  Steinhoewel, a physician of Ulm, was translated into French, and  became the chief source of later collections, thus appearing in the  remote ancestry of the work of La Fontaine. The aesthetic value of  the mediaeval fables, including those of Marie de France, is small;  the didactic intention was strong, the literary art was feeble.    [Footnote 1: The earlier \"Romulus\" was the name of the supposed author  of the fables of Phaedrus, while that of Phaedrus was still unknown.]    It is far otherwise with the famous beast-epic, the ROMAN DE RENARD.  The cycle consists of many parts or \"branches\" connected by a common  theme; originating and obscurely developed in the North, in Picardy,  in Normandy, and the Isle of France, it suddenly appeared in  literature in the middle of the twelfth century, and continued to  receive additions and variations during nearly two hundred years.  The spirit of the _Renard_ poems is essentially bourgeois; the heroes  of the _chansons de geste_ achieve their wondrous deeds by strength  and valour; Renard the fox is powerful by skill and cunning; the  greater beasts--his chief enemy the wolf, and others--are no match  for his ingenuity and endless resources; but he is powerless against  smaller creatures, the cock, the crow, the sparrow. The names of the  personages are either significant names, such as Noble, the lion,  and Chanticleer, the cock, or proper names, such as Isengrin, the  wolf, Bruno, the bear, Tibert, the cat, Bernard, the ass; and as  certain of these proper names are found in the eastern district, it  has been conjectured that a poet of Lotharingia in the tenth century  first told in Latin the wars of fox and wolf, and that through  translations the epic matter, derived originally from popular  tradition, reached the trouveres of the North. While in a certain  degree typical figures, the beasts are at the same time individual;  Renard is not the representative merely of a species; he is Renard,  an individual, with a personality of his own; Isengrin is not merely  a wolf, he is the particular wolf Isengrin; each is an epic individual,  heroic and undying. Classical fable remotely exerted an influence  on certain branches of the Romance; but the vital substance of the  epic is derived from the stores of popular tradition in which material  from all quarters--the North of Europe and the Eastern world--had  been gradually fused. In the artistic treatment of such material the  chief difficulty lies in preserving a just measure between the  beast-character and the imported element of humanity. Little by  little the anthropomorphic features were developed at the expense  of verisimilitude; the beast forms became a mere masquerade; the  romances were converted into a satire, and the satire lost rather  than gained by the inefficient disguise.    The earliest branches of the cycle have reached us only in a  fragmentary way, but they can be in part reconstructed from the Latin  _Isengrinus_ of Nivard of Ghent (about 1150), and from the German  _Reinhart Fuchs_, a rendering from the French by an Alsatian, Henri  le Glichezare (about 1180). The wars of Renard and Isengrin are here  sung, and the failure of Renard's trickeries against the lesser  creatures; the spirit of these early branches is one of frank gaiety,  untroubled by a didactic or satirical intention. In the branches of  the second period the parody of human society is apparent; some of  the episodes are fatiguing in their details; some are intolerably  gross, but the poem known as the Branch of the Judgment is masterly--an  ironical comedy, in which, without sacrifice of the primitive  character of the beast-epic, the spirit of mediaeval life is  transported into the animal world. Isengrin, the accuser of Renard  before King Noble and his court, is for a moment worsted; the fox  is vindicated, when suddenly enters a funeral cortege--Chanticleer  and his four wives bear upon a litter the dead body of one of their  family, the victim of Renard's wiles. The prayers for the dead are  recited, the burial is celebrated with due honour, and Renard is  summoned to justice; lie heaped upon lie will not save him; at last  he humbles himself with pious repentance, and promising to seek God's  pardon over-sea, is permitted in his pilgrim's habit to quit the court.  It is this Judgment of Renard which formed the basis of the _Reineke  Fuchs_, known to us through the modernisation of Goethe.    From the date of the Branch of the Judgment the Renard Romances  declined. The Judgment was imitated by inferior hands, and the beasts  were more and more nearly transformed to men; the spirit of gaiety  was replaced by seriousness or gloom; Renard ceased to be a  light-footed and ingenious rogue; he became a type of human fraud  and cruelty; whatever in society was false and base and merciless  became a form of \"renardie,\" and by \"renardie\" the whole world seemed  to be ruled. Such is the temper expressed in _Le Couronnement Renard_,  written in Flanders soon after 1250, a satire directed chiefly against  the mendicant orders, in which the fox, turned friar for a season,  ascends the throne. _Renard le Nouveau_, the work of a poet of Lille,  Jacquemart Gelee, nearly half a century later, represents again the  triumph of the spirit of evil; although far inferior in execution  to the _Judgment_, it had remarkable success, to which the allegory,  wearying to a modern reader, no doubt contributed at a time when  allegory was a delight. The last of the Renard romances, _Renard le  Contrefait_, was composed at Troyes before 1328, by an ecclesiastic  who had renounced his profession and turned to trade. In his leisure  hours he spun, in discipleship to Jean de Meun, his interminable poem,  which is less a romance than an encyclopaedia of all the knowledge  and all the opinions of the author. This latest _Renard_ has a value  akin to that of the second part of _Le Roman de la Rose_; it is a  presentation of the ideas and manners of the time by one who freely  criticised and mocked the powers that be, both secular and sacred,  and who was in sympathy with a certain movement or tendency towards  social, political, and intellectual reform.      III  FABLIAUX    The name _fabliaux_ is applied to short versified tales, comic in  character, and intended rather for recitation than for song. Out of  a far larger number about one hundred and fifty have survived. The  earliest--_Richeut_--is of the year 1159. From the middle of the  twelfth century, together with the heroic or sentimental poetry of  feudalism, we find this bourgeois poetry of realistic observation;  and even in the _chansons de geste_, in occasional comic episodes,  something may be seen which is in close kinship with the fabliaux.  Many brief humorous stories, having much in common under their various  disguises, exist as part of the tradition of many lands and peoples.  The theory which traces the French fabliaux to Indian originals is  unproved, and indeed is unnecessary. The East, doubtless,  contributed its quota to the common stock, but so did other quarters  of the globe; such tales are ubiquitous and are undying, only the  particular form which they assume being determined by local  conditions.    The fabliaux, as we can study them, belong especially to the north  and north-east of France, and they continued to be put forth by their  rhymers until about 1340, the close of the twelfth and the beginning  of the thirteenth century being the period of their greatest  popularity. Simple and obvious jests sufficed to raise a laugh among  folk disposed to good humour; by degrees something of art and skill  was attained. The misfortunes of husbands supplied an inexhaustible  store of merriment; if woman and the love of woman were idealised  in the romances, the fabliaux took their revenge, and exhibited her  as the pretty traitress of a shameless comedy. If religion was  honoured in the age of faith, the bourgeois spirit found matter of  mirth in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24708"],[0,"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction (#6)"],[1,"of each  testis. Within these lobules the spermatozoa are formed by a complex  process of cell division and cell germination upon whose description  we need not enter here.    The _spermatozoon_ may be described as the male sexual cell whose  function is to fertilize the female ovum. The spermatozoon is about  1/20 of an inch in length and consists of a head, body and a vibratile  tail. In the human spermatozoon the head is ovoid, appearing  pear-shaped or pointed in one view and elliptical in another.    The _epididymis_ referred to above, consists of a mass of coiled tubes  and blood vessels. After the secretion passes through the tortuous  coils of ciliated tubes of the epididymis, it is collected into a  single tube called the _vas deferens_, which passes as a part of the  spermatic cord from the scrotum, up through the groin and over the  pubic arch into the pelvic cavity, passing down back of the bladder  where it is slightly dilated into an _ampulla_, beyond which the duct  is again contracted into a narrow tube, and the two ducts, one from  either side, converge and pass into the _prostate gland_, where they  empty into the _urethra_.    _The seminal vesicles._--The seminal vesicles are small bladder-like  organs supposed originally to contain the secreted semen collected  from the testes. There are two of these vesicles, from each a small  duct joins the vas deferens making up what is known as the  _ejaculatory duct_. The two ejaculatory ducts coming together in the  prostate gland open into the urethra. _The seminal vesicles possess  glandular walls and secrete the substance which they contain, no part  of the secretion of the testes normally finding its way into the  vesicles._    _The prostate gland, a portion of which is homologous with the female  uterus and called uterus masculinus_, is situated around the neck of  the bladder and is traversed not only by the urethra (prostatic  portion), but also by the ejaculatory ducts. There are numerous gland  ducts which--collecting the secretion of the prostate gland--open into  the urethra in the prostatic portion.    Just beyond the prostate are two small glands called _Cowper's Glands_  whose ducts enter the urethra some distance beyond the prostate, at  the root of the penis.      2. PHYSIOLOGY.    In the treatment of the physiology of the various structures just  described, we may well reverse the order of treatment, thus leading up  step by step to a consideration of the more important organs.    a. =Urethra.= The canal or duct of the penis is called the urethra,  and it is important in considering its physiology to remember that it  has not only a double function to perform, but that the performance of  one function in a measure temporarily unfits it for performance of the  other and makes it necessary for a special measure of preparation.    The urinary excretion from the kidneys collecting in the urinary  bladder is passed out periodically through the urethra. This same  channel must transmit periodically secretions from the sexual  apparatus.    b. =Cowper's Glands= secrete only under sexual excitement, and usually  they secrete only when the sexual excitement reaches a stage which  induces an erection. The secretion is composed of a clear _alkaline  mucus_.    The purpose served in the natural economy by this alkaline mucus is a  very important one and it is essential that every young man should  understand it.    It will be remembered that the male urethra affords passage not only  for the urine, but also for the generative products. The urine is  acid in reaction and the frequent passage of urine along the urethra  leaves that duct acid in reaction under usual conditions. The  spermatozoa are very sensitive to acid and their vitality is seriously  impaired by acid of any kind, particularly the acid of the urine.  Nature has provided that the secretion from Cowper's glands should  precede the generative products along the urethra, thus neutralizing  the acid and insuring for the spermatozoa an alkaline passage from the  body.    Besides this important function of the secretion from Cowper's glands,  the slimy transparent mucus appearing at the glans penis under sexual  excitement serves as a natural lubricant covering the glans of the  male organ. A secretion from the female similarly prepares her organs  for sexual contact so that the delicate mucous membrane, particularly  of the female organs, shall not suffer abrasion.    Many young men have experienced the appearance of the secretion from  Cowper's glands and wholly misunderstanding its nature have feared  that they were losing some vital fluid. This misunderstanding of the  nature of this fluid makes the young man especially subject to the  misrepresentations of the advertising quack and charlatan who allege  that he is losing vital fluid and will, if not treated, undergo  general debility and loss of procreative power. This brief  explanation of the significance of the secretion of Cowper's glands  will protect the young man from any such misrepresentations.    c. =The Prostate Gland.=--That the prostate gland is intimately  associated with reproduction is evident from the fact that in those  male animals that have suffered castration before puberty, the  prostate gland withers and practically disappears. What then is the  role that this gland plays? Like Cowper's glands, it secretes only  during sexual excitement. Under such excitement its ducts become  gorged with a secretion peculiar to it and at the moment of the  emission or the ejaculation of the semen the numerous ducts empty  their contents into the urethra to be mingled with and made a part of  the semen.    The secretion of the prostate is composed of a watery solution of  protein and of alkaline salts and so closely similar to the secretion  of the seminal vesicles that we will consider its action along with  that of the secretion from the vesicles.    d. =The Seminal Vesicles.=--_The seminal vesicles secrete  continuously._ The secretion is composed of an aqueous solution of  albumin and of alkaline salts. This secretion together with the  secretion from the prostate gland is poured into the urethra at the  moment of sexual orgasm; they become mixed in their transit through  the urethra with the secretion from the testes. This mixture is known  as semen. [See pg. 42.]    It used to be supposed that the semen was secreted wholly by the  testes; that the testes were secreting continuously and that the  seminal vesicles were receptacles for the gradually accumulating semen  from the testes. The researches of Steinach and others have made the  old theory untenable and demonstrate that the semen is a mixture from  three distinct sources; that the testicles secrete their contribution  to the semen only during sexual stimulation; while the seminal  vesicles secreting their products continuously become periodically  filled and distended.    Let us inquire regarding the function of this alkaline albuminous  secretion from the vesicles and prostate. For what purpose does Nature  prepare such a secretion? The spermatozoa frequently remain several  days in the organs of the female before the ovum is found and  fertilized. During these several days the spermatozoa are exerting no  small amount of energy in their vigorous flagellate movement. For such  an expenditure of energy they must receive nourishment and  stimulation. The nourishment is supplied by the albumin and proteid of  the vesicular and prostatic secretions. The stimulation is supplied by  the salts also secreted by these glands. The recent researches of Loeb  and others have demonstrated the importance of mineral salts in  stimulating the activity of living cells. One can cite no better  example of this stimulant action than the influence of these  vesicular and prostatic salts upon the activity of the spermatozoa.    The vesicles and prostate may be looked upon as the commissariat of  the army of spermatozoa; the vesicles accumulating a stock of supplies  to be drawn upon at short notice; the prostate representing a factory  where a considerable quantity of supplies can be prepared at short  notice.    This _periodic distention of the seminal vesicles_ is a matter of very  considerable hygienic importance and must be thoroughly understood by  every young man who would lead a normal sexual life.    These organs in common with all other organs of the body are supplied  with two sets of nerves, one set passing away to the spinal cord and  carrying messages which indicate the condition of the organ or the  presence and character of any local stimulus; the other passing away  from the spinal cord to the organ and carrying secretory and motor  impulses. The secretory impulses are more or less continuous and as a  result, these glands secret continuously and become periodically  distended as described above. The motor impulses pass to the muscles  within the walls of the vesicles, causing a strong spasmodic  contraction of these muscles at the moment of emission of semen, thus  throwing the contents of the vesicles into the urethra at the same  moment when the epididymis the vas deferens and the ducts of the  prostate are emptying their secreted contents into the urethra.    Now the sensory nerves passing from the seminal vesicles up to the  erection and emission centers are stimulated by any unusual pressure  within the vesicles. Unusual pressure may be caused either by  distention due to accumulated secretion or by pressure upon the  vesicles from over-distended rectum or bladder. It sometimes happens  that two or more of these influences are acting at the same time.  These impulses are most likely to be effective when the subject is  asleep, and particularly if he is lying upon his back. The result of  the stimulus is to cause an erection, accompanied usually by an erotic  dream, the whole phenomenon culminating in an emission of the contents  of the seminal vesicles and"]]]
