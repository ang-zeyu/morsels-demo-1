On account of  the astringent qualities of the coloring matter it is used in some  countries to treat dysentery, a fact which suggests its possible  therapeutic or rather hygienic usefulness as a condiment. It seems  to effect a cure in dysentery in the same manner as ipecac.    In India, Brazil and the Antilles the natives make a sort of paste  of achuete known under the name of _rocu_. There is a hard, odorless  form of rocu and another soft, unctuous, of a delicate red color and  an odor rendered highly disagreeable by the urine added to it to keep  it soft. Rocu is the preparation of achuete that has been subjected  to chemical analysis. Its composition is as follows: Two coloring  matters, _bixin_ (C_28_H_34_O_5_), of a red color, resinous, soluble  in alcohol, ether, alkaline solutions and benzine, crystallizing in  microscopic laminæ, quadrangular, red, of a metallic violet lustre;  _orellin_, yellow in color, soluble in alcohol and in water.    Botanical Description.--A well-known tree growing to a height  of 5-7 meters, with leaves alternate, simple, oval, heart-shaped  at the base, sharply pointed, glabrous, short petioles. Flowers in  panicles. Calyx, 5 rounded sepals, tuberculate at the base, imbricated,  caducous. Corolla of 5 rose-colored petals. Stamens very numerous,  free, inserted on the receptacle. Capsule round, dark red, bristling  with stout hairs of the same color. The seeds are covered with a fine,  yellowish-red powder.        _Pangium edule_, Reinw. (_Hydonocarpus polyandra_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Pangi_, Tag.    Uses.--All parts of this tree are anthelmintic. The seeds, fruit,  leaves and bark all possess narcotic properties dangerous to man and  the symptoms following an excessive dose are sleepiness, headache,  a sort of intoxication or an attack of delirium that may end in  death. These narcotic properties have been utilized in Java to  stupefy the fish in the rivers by throwing the bark in the pools  and quiet portions of the stream. The juice of the leaves is used in  the treatment of chronic skin diseases. In Amboina the natives eat  the seeds, the toxic quality of which is removed by brushing and  macerating in pure water for a certain time. After such treatment  they may be eaten with impunity and an oil may be extracted from them  which is useful as a food.    Botanical Description.--A tree with leaves 5' long, alternate,  ovate, broad, entire, glabrous, palmately nerved. Petiole long with  2 persistent lateral stipules. Flowers dioecious, the male ones in  panicles, the female solitary. Calyx gamosepalous, dividing unequally  when the flower opens. The male flower has a corolla of 5-7 petals,  violet-colored, concave, half oval, with pubescent borders; at its  base a flat scale. Stamens free, numerous, thick filaments, anthers  bilocular. In the female flower the perianth is the same as in the  former, the stamens sterile. Ovary unilocular, with 2-4 parietal  placentæ with many ovules. Fruit as large as a man's head, with thin  woody pericarp and many seeds embedded within its pulp.          PORTULACACEÆ.    Purslane Family.        _Portulaca oleracea_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Verdolagas_, Sp.; _Olasiman_, _Kolasiman_, Tag.;  _Purslane_, Eng.    Uses.--The entire plant is edible, in the form of a salad or as  a condiment with meat or fish. The leaves are succulent and acid,  and the juice expressed from them is used as an eyewash to remove  corneal opacities; it is also used in superficial erysipelas and  other skin affections. The bruised leaves are used as a poultice for  abscesses, contusions and on the temples for headache. The juice is  given internally to check hæmoptysis and in diseases of the lungs  and bladder; the seeds also are used in these complaints.    Botanical Description.--A plant with prostrate stem. Leaves fleshy,  wedge-shaped. Flowers small, sessile, terminal, pale yellow. Calyx  of 2 large teeth, deciduous. Corolla, 4-5 petals with a notch at the  end. Stamens 9-14. Style of equal length with the stamens. Stigma in  4-6 divisions. The seed vessel, which dehisces horizontally, contains  many small, heart-shaped seeds.    Habitat.--It grows in all parts of the islands.          GUTTIFERÆ.    Gamboge Family.        _Garcinia mangostana_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Mangostán_, Sp.; _Mangosteen_, Eng.    Uses.--The seed of the fruit is astringent and is given internally  as an infusion in dysentery and chronic diarrhoea. The decoction is  very useful as an injection in leucorrhoea.    The following potion has given excellent results to Dr. Ed. J. Waring  in chronic dysentery and the diarrhoeas of tropical countries:              Dried peel of mangosteen       60 grams.          Cumin seed                      5 grams.          Coriander                       5 grams.          Water                       1,200 grams.      Boil till reduced to 600 grams. Take 120 grams twice a day. Tincture  of opium may be added.    An analysis of mangosteen peel by W. Schmidt demonstrated a large  quantity of tannin, a resin and a crystallizable principle named  _mangostin_ (C_20_H_23_O_5_) which exists in the form of fine,  golden yellow laminæ, tasteless, soluble in alcohol, ether and the  alkalies, insoluble in water. With the perchloride of iron it gives  a blackish-green color, and sulphuric acid colors it red.    Botanical Description.--The mangosteen grows only in the southern  islands of the Archipelago and its delicious fruit is the part of  the plant known in Manila. The peel is at the present time almost  universally employed in medicine. The fruit is about the size of  a small Manila orange, the pericarp a dark red or chocolate color,  tough and thick, crowned with the remains of the calyx. On breaking  it open the edible portion of the fruit is seen, consisting of 6-18  seeds covered by a white, sweet pulp, cottony in appearance, of a  delicious slightly acrid flavor.        1. _Garcinia venulosa_, Choisy. (_Cambogia venulosa_, Blanco.)  2. _G. Cambogia_, Desrouss. (_Cambogia binucao_, Blanco.)      Nom. Vulg.--_Binukaw_, Tag., applied to both trees, though the first  is also called _Gatasan pulá_ in Tagalo and _Taklang-anak_ in Pampango.    Uses.--The fruit of the second species, the true name of which is  _binucaw_, is acid and edible. The fruit and the trunk of both species,  when cut, exude a gum-resin very much like gamboge which is obtained  from the _G. morella_ or _G. pedicellata_, Desr. These gum-resins,  however, seem to be much inferior to gamboge; they contain an essential  oil which does not exist in the latter and their color is paler.    Botanical Description.--The _G. venulosa_ is a tree with leaves  opposite, lanceolate, acute, entire and glabrous, the inferior surface  covered with nervelets which converge at the apex. Petioles short and  flattened. Flowers tetramerous. Calyx, 4 persistent sepals. Corolla,  4 petals, overlapping, fleshy, ovate, of the same color as the  calyx. Stamens numerous; no filaments; anthers round and very  small. Style very short and thick, stigma peltate, divided into 10  parts. Fruit globose, depressed, no well-marked ridges when ripe.    _G. Cambogia_ differs from the foregoing in the leaves which present  no nervelets on the lower surface and the fruit which presents 8  angles or rounded ridges.    Habitat.--Very common throughout the islands, abounding in the  mountains of San Mateo and Morong. Blooms in August.        _Garcinia morella_, Desr.    Nom. Vulg.--I do not know the name given by the Filipinos to this  tree, which Vidal and Soler have seen in Montalván, Tiwi (Albay)  and San Mateo (Province of Manila); but it is highly important in  medicine as the true gamboge is obtained from it. _Gamboge Tree_, Eng.    The Gamboge of the U. S. P. and B. P. is obtained from _G. Hanburii_  which differs somewhat botanically from _G. morella_.    Uses.--All parts of the plant contain a thick, yellow, milky juice  which constitutes the gamboge. In Malabar, Ceylon, Canara and Singapore  the following method of extraction is followed: At the beginning of the  rainy season a spiral incision is made around the bark of about half  the tree trunk, and a piece of bamboo is fixed in place to collect  the juice which slowly exudes from the cut for several months, soon  becoming viscid and then solid after contact with the air. One tree,  as a rule, yields enough sap to fill three internodal segments of  bamboo, each 50 cm. long by 3-5 cm. in diameter.    Gamboge is a laxative in doses of 10-15 cgm., produces abundant  evacuations with violent colicky pains in doses of 30-50 cgm., and  is an irritant poison in large doses. In other words it is a highly  energetic hydragogue cathartic, especially indicated when we wish  to drain off the fluid element of the blood, as in dropsy, asthma,  pulmonary and cerebral congestion. It is also used as a vermifuge.    It is rarely given alone, but is combined with calomel, aloes, jalap,  rhubarb, etc.    It is official in all pharmacopoeias.    Botanical Description.--A tree 10-20 meters high, with leaves opposite,  elliptical, lanceolate, narrowed at both extremities, acuminate,  entire, coriaceous, glabrous, 10-12 cm. long by 3-4 cm. broad, with  short petioles. Flowers dioecious. Male flower axillary, solitary or in  groups of 3-6, pedunculate with small bracts. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla,  4 petals, orbicular, thick, fleshy. Stamens 30-40, sessile, adherent  at the base. Anthers unilocular. Female flower sessile, solitary,  axillary, larger than the male; calyx and corolla equal; staminodia  20-30, jointed at the base, forming a membranous corolla from the  upper edge of which spring a few short filaments which support each  a suboval sterile anther. The ovary is superior and almost spherical,  with 4 cells each containing 1 ovule. The fruit, almost spherical, is  2 1/2 cm. in diameter, corticate, bearing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641"],[0,"A Room with a View (#6)"],[1,"absurd. He approached, his  face in the shadow. He said:    \"Miss Bartlett.\"    \"Oh, good gracious me!\" said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing  the whole of life in a new perspective. \"Where? Where?\"    \"In the nave.\"    \"I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have--\" She checked  herself.    \"Poor girl!\" exploded Mr. Emerson. \"Poor girl!\"    She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling  herself.    \"Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think  myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you. I'm thoroughly happy, and  having a splendid time. Pray don't waste time mourning over me. There's  enough sorrow in the world, isn't there, without trying to invent it.  Good-bye. Thank you both so much for all your kindness. Ah, yes! there  does come my cousin. A delightful morning! Santa Croce is a wonderful  church.\"    She joined her cousin.        Chapter III: Music, Violets, and the Letter \"S\"    It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered  a more solid world when she opened the piano. She was then no longer  either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.  The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept  those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The  commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without  effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and  thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate  his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.  Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom. Lucy  had done so never.    She was no dazzling executante; her runs were not at all like strings of  pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one  of her age and situation. Nor was she the passionate young lady, who  performs so tragically on a summer's evening with the window open.  Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped  between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the  pictorial style. And she was tragical only in the sense that she was  great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what and  over what--that is more than the words of daily life can tell us. But  that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay;  yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had  decided that they should triumph.    A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she  really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. A few  people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she  made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or  to sleep. She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of  Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for  her cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by  the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by  touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.    Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical  element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge  Wells when he had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments  where the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with  a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under  the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing  of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was \"Miss Honeychurch.  Piano. Beethoven,\" and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be  Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure  was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III. He was in suspense all  through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know  what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening theme he knew  that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the  conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. He was glad that she  only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to  the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen. The audience  clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping;  it was all that one could do.    \"Who is she?\" he asked the vicar afterwards.    \"Cousin of one of my parishioners. I do not consider her choice of a  piece happy. Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal  that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if  anything, disturbs.\"    \"Introduce me.\"    \"She will be delighted. She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of  your sermon.\"    \"My sermon?\" cried Mr. Beebe. \"Why ever did she listen to it?\"    When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,  disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of  dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She loved going to  concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and  meringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But before  he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now  made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily  towards him:    \"If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very  exciting both for us and for her.\"    Lucy at once re-entered daily life.    \"Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she  said she trusted I should never live a duet.\"    \"Doesn't Mrs. Honeychurch like music?\"    \"She doesn't mind it. But she doesn't like one to get excited over  anything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks--I can't make  out. Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any  one's. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn't mean that I played  well; I only meant--\"    \"Of course,\" said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.    \"Music--\" said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not  complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole  life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in  Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.    The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,  and the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were concealed  Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit  the Torre del Gallo.    \"What about music?\" said Mr. Beebe.    \"Poor Charlotte will be sopped,\" was Lucy's reply.    The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,  tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and  a tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world was  singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to  stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit  companion for a hearty girl.    \"Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true  Italy in the wet I believe.\"    \"Miss Lavish is so original,\" murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,  the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of  definition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but  they would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for  other reasons, he held his peace.    \"Is it true,\" continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, \"that Miss Lavish is  writing a book?\"    \"They do say so.\"    \"What is it about?\"    \"It will be a novel,\" replied Mr. Beebe, \"dealing with modern Italy.  Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words  herself more admirably than any one I know.\"    \"I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But  I don't think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in  Santa Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone,  and so I couldn't help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.\"    \"The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.\"    He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently  dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each  other's company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed  he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of  strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting  her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at  Tunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies;  they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample  opportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,  but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his  attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather  than enthralled.    Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The  Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts  upon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze  of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse. She  opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing  a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment  by the door.    \"Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here  besides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually  nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.\"    She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was  on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.    \"I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in  my room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one  has the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches it  from another.\"    Lucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell"]]]
