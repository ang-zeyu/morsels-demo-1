The Idaans consider  themselves the descendants of these settlers, but that can only  be true in a very limited sense. Both country and people, however,  show traces of Chinese influence.    There is good evidence that the Chinese influence and immigration  were not confined to Bruni and the northern end of the island. In  south-west Borneo there are traces of very extensive washings of  alluvial gravels for gold and diamonds. These operations were being  conducted by Chinese when Europeans first came to the country; and  the extent of the old workings implies that they had been continued  through many centuries. Hindu-Javan influence also was not confined  to the court of Bruni, for in many parts of the southern half of  Borneo traces of it survive in the custom of burning the dead, in low  relief carvings of bulls on stone, and in various gold ornaments of  Hindu character.    The faith of Islam and the arrival of Europeans have profoundly  affected the manners and politics of the East Indies, and now it is  difficult to picture the state of affairs when King Hiawang revisited  China to pay homage to the Emperor. In 1521, within a hundred years  of that event, Pigafetta, the chronicler of Magellan's great exploit,  was calling on the \"Moorish\" king of Bruni, in the course of the  first voyage round the world. The change had come. Of the two new  influences, so potent for good and evil, Mohammedanism made its  appearance first. The struggle for religious supremacy ended in the  complete victory of the Prophet's followers in 1478, when Majapahit  was utterly destroyed, thirty years before the capture of Malacca by  the Portuguese.    How early the Arab doctrines were taught in Bruni  is impossible  to state with any precision. Local tradition ascribes their  introduction to the renowned Alak ber Tata, afterwards known as Sultan  Mohammed. Like most of his subjects this warrior was a Bisaya, and in  early life he was not a Mohammedan, not indeed a civilised potentate  at all, to judge by conventional standards; for the chief mark of  his royal dignity was an immense chawat, or loin-cloth, carried as  he walked by eighty men, forty in front and forty behind. He is the  earliest monarch of whom the present Brunis have any knowledge, a fact  to be accounted for partly by the brilliance of his exploits, partly  by the introduction about that time of Arabic writing. After much  fighting he subdued the people of Igan,[16] Kalaka, Seribas, Sadong,  Semarahan, and Sarawak,[17] and compelled them to pay tribute. He  stopped the annual payment to Majapahit of one jar of pinang juice,  a useless commodity though troublesome to collect. During his reign  the Muruts were brought under Bruni rule by peaceful measures,[18]  and the Chinese colony was kept in good humour by the marriage of  the Bruni king's brother and successor to the daughter of one of the  principal Chinamen.    Alak ber Tata is said to have gone to Johore,[19] where he was  converted[20] to Islam, given[21] the daughter of Sultan Bakhei and  the title of Sultan, and was confirmed in his claim to rule over  Sarawak and his other conquests.[22]    Sultan Mohammed was succeeded by his brother Akhmad, son-in-law of  the Chinese chief, and he was in turn succeeded by an Arab from Taif  who had married his daughter. Thus the present royal house of Bruni is  derived from three sources -- Arab, Bisaya, and Chinese. The coronation  ceremony as still maintained affords an interesting confirmation of  this account. On that occasion the principal minister wears a turban  and Haji outfit, the two next in rank are dressed in Chinese and Hindu  fashion, while the fourth wears a chawat over his trousers to represent  the Bisayas; and each of these ministers declares the Sultan to be  divinely appointed. Then after the demonstration of loyalty the two  gongs -- one from Menangkabau, the other from Johore -- are beaten,  and the Moslem high priest proclaims the Sultan and preaches a sermon,  declaring him to be a descendant of Sri Turi Buana, the Palembang  chief who founded the early kingdom of Singapore in 1160 A.D., who  reigned in that island for forty-eight years, and whose descendants  became the royal family of Malacca.    The Arab Sultan who succeeded Akhmed assumed the name Berkat and ruled  the country with vigour. He built a mosque and converted many of his  subjects, so that from his reign Bruni may be considered a Mohammedan  town. To defend the capital he sank forty junks filled with stone  in the river, and thus formed the breakwater which still bars the  entrance to large ships. This work rose above the water level, and  in former times bristled with cannon. Sultan Berkat was succeeded by  his son Suleiman, whose reign was of little consequence.    Neglecting Suleiman, we come now to the most heroic figure in Bruni  history, Sultan Bulkiah, better known by his earlier name, Nakoda  Ragam. The prowess of this prince has been celebrated in prose and  verse. He journeyed to distant lands, and conquered the Sulu islands  and eastern Borneo. Over the throne of Sambas he set a weak-minded  brother of his own. He even sent an expedition to Manila, and on the  second attempt seized that place. Tribute poured into his coffers from  all sides. His wife was a Javanese princess, who brought many people  to Bruni. These intermarried with the Bisayas, and from them it is  said are sprung the Kadayans, a quiet agricultural folk, skilled  in various arts, but rendered timid by continual oppression. Some  have settled recently in the British colony of Labuan, and others in  Sarawak round the river Sibuti, where they have become loyal subjects  of the Rajah of Sarawak.    Nakoda Ragam's capital at Buang Tawa was on dry land, but when he died,  killed accidentally by his wife's bodkin, the nobles quarrelled among  themselves, and some of them founded the present pile-built town of  Bruni. It was to this Malay capital and court that Pigafetta paid  his visit in 1521 with the surviving companions of Magellan. His is  the first good account from European sources of the place which he  called Bornei, and whose latitude he estimated with an error of less  than ten miles.[23]    It is easy to see from Pigafetta's narrative[24] that at the  date of his visit the effects of Nakoda Ragam's exploits had not  evaporated. The splendour of the Court and the large population the  city is said to have contained were presumably the result of the  conquests he had made in neighbouring islands. The king, like the  princes of Malacca before the conquest, had his elephants, and he and  his courtiers were clothed in Chinese satins and Indian brocades. He  was in possession of artillery, and the appearance and ceremonial of  his court was imposing.    From this time onwards the power of Bruni has continuously  declined. Recurrent civil wars invited the occasional interventions  of the Portuguese and of the Spanish governors of the Philippines,  which, although they did not result in the subjugation of the Malay  power, nevertheless sapped its strength.    The interest of the later history of Borneo lies in the successive  attempts,[25] many of them fruitless, made by Dutch and English to  gain a footing on the island. The Dutch arrived off Bruni in the year  1600, and ten days afterwards were glad to leave with what pepper  they had obtained in the interval, the commander judging the place  nothing better than a nest of rogues. The Dutch did not press the  acquaintance, but started factories at Sambas, where they monopolised  the trade. In 1685 an English captain named Cowley arrived in Bruni;  but the English showed as little inclination as the Dutch to take up  the commerce which the Portuguese had abandoned.    At Banjermasin, on the southern coast, more progress was made. The  Dutch arrived there before their English rivals, but were soon  compelled by intrigues to withdraw. In 1704[26] the English factors  on the Chinese island of Chusan, expelled by the imperial authorities  and subsequently driven from Pulo Condar off the Cochin China coast  by a mutiny, arrived at Banjermasin. They had every reason to be  gratified with the prospects at that port; for they could sell the  native pepper to the Chinese at three times the cost price. But their  bitter experiences in the China seas had not taught them wisdom; they  soon fell out with the Javanese Sultan, whose hospitality they were  enjoying, and after some bloody struggles were obliged to withdraw  from this part of the island.    In 1747 the Dutch East India Company, which in 1705 had obtained a firm  footing in Java, and in 1745 had established its authority over all  the north-eastern coast of that island, extorted a monopoly of trade  at Banjermasin and set up a factory. Nearly forty years later[27]  (1785), the reigning prince having rendered himself odious to his  subjects, the country was invaded by 3000 natives of Celebes. These  were expelled by the Dutch, who dethroned the Sultan, placing his  younger brother on the throne; and he, in reward for their services,  ceded to them his entire dominions, consenting to hold them as a  vassal. This is the treaty under which the Dutch claim the sovereignty  of Banjermasin and whatever was once dependent on it. In this way  the Dutch got a hold on the country which they have never relaxed;  and, after the interval during which their possessions in the East  Indies were administered by England,[28] they strengthened that hold  gradually, year by year, till now two-thirds or more of the island  is under their flag and feels the benefits of their rule. If there  are still any districts of this large area where Dutch influence has  even now barely made itself felt, they will not long remain in their  isolation; for the Controleurs are extending their influence even  into the most remote corners of the territory.    To turn again to the north-western coast and the doings of Englishmen, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#6)"],[1,"the origin of the great kingdom, and can take our choice. There are  many others also. Perhaps the most reasonable account would be one  culled from the general drift of the Hindu legends combined with the  certainties of historical fact; and from this point of view we may  for the present suppose that two brothers, Hindus of the Kuruba caste,  who were men of strong religious feeling, serving in the treasury of  the king of Warangal, fled from that place on its sack and destruction  in 1323 and took service under the petty Rajah of Anegundi. Both they  and their chiefs were filled with horror and disgust at the conduct of  the marauding Moslems, and pledged themselves to the cause of their  country and their religion. The brothers rose to be minister and  treasurer respectively at Anegundi. In 1334 the chief gave shelter  to Baha-ud-din, nephew of Muhammad of Delhi, and was attacked by the  Sultan. Anegundi fell, as narrated by Batuta, and the Sultan retired,  leaving Mallik as his deputy to rule the state. Mallik found the  people too strong for him, and eventually the Sultan restored the  country to the Hindus, raising to be rajah and minister respectively  the two brothers who had formerly been minister and treasurer. These  were Harihara I. (\"Hukka\") and Bukka I.        The First Vijayanagar Dynasty    [The following shows the pedigree of this dynasty as given in the  EPIGRAPHIA INDICA (iii. p. 36). Inscriptions not yet satisfactorily  examined will probably add to the information given.]              CHAPTER 3    The First Kings (A.D. 1336 to 1379)    Rapid acquisition of territory -- Reign of Harihara I. -- Check to  Muhammadan aggression -- Reign of Bukka I. -- Kampa and Sangama? --  The Bahmani kingdom established, 1347 -- Death of Nagadeva of Warangal  -- Vijayanagar's first great war -- Massacres by Muhammad Bahmani --  Battle at Adoni, 1366 -- Flight of Bukka -- Mujahid's war, 1375 --  He visits the Malabar coast -- Siege of Vijayanagar -- Extension of  territory -- Death of Mujahid, 1378.    The city of Vijayanagar, thus founded about the year 1335, speedily  grew in importance and became the refuge of the outcasts, refugees,  and fighting men of the Hindus, beaten and driven out of their old  strongholds by the advancing Muhammadans.    The first rulers of Vijayanagar, however, did not dare to call  themselves kings, nor did even the Brahmans do so who composed the text  of their early inscriptions. It is for this reason that I have spoken  of Harihara I. and Bukka I. as \"Chiefs.\" The inscription referred to of  Harihara in 1340 calls him \"Hariyappa VODEYA,\" the former name being  less honourable than \"Harihara,\" and the latter definitely entitling  him to rank only as a chieftain. Moreover, the Sanskrit title given  him is MAHAMANDALESVARA, which may be translated \"great lord\" --  not king. And the same is the case with his successor, Bukka, in  two inscriptions,[32] one of which is dated in 1353. Already in 1340  Harihara is said to have been possessed of very large territories,  and he was the acknowledged overlord of villages as far north as the  Kaladgi district, north of the Malprabha, a country that had been  overrun by Muhammad Taghlaq. That this was not a mere empty boast  is shown by the fact that a fort was built in that year at Badami by  permission of Harihara.    And thus we see the first chief of Vijayanagar quietly, and perhaps  peacefully, acquiring great influence and extensive possessions. These  so rapidly increased that Bukka's successor, Harihara II., styles  himself RAJADHIRAJA, \"king of kings,\" or emperor.    But to revert to the first king Harihara, or, as Nuniz calls him,  \"Dehorao,\" for DEVA RAYA. He reigned, according to our chronicle,  seven years, \"and did nothing therein but pacify the kingdom, which  he left in complete tranquillity.\" His death, if this be so, would  have taken place about the year 1343. Nuniz relates that he founded  a temple in honour of the Brahman hermit, his protector. This was  the great temple at Hampe close to the river, which is still in full  preservation and is the only one among the massive shrines erected  at the capital in which worship is still carried on; the others were  remorselessly wrecked and destroyed by the Muhammadans in 1565. As  already stated, the traveller Ibn Batuta refers to this king under  the name of \"Haraib\" or \"Harib\" in or about the year 1342. If the  traditions collated by Nuniz, according to which Harihara I. lived at  peace during the seven years of his reign, be true, his death must  have occurred before 1344, because in that year, as we learn from  other sources, Krishna, son of Pratapa Rudra of Warangal, took refuge  at Vijayanagar, and, in concert with its king and with the surviving  Ballala princes of Dvarasamudra, drove back the Muhammadans, rescued  for a time part of the Southern Dakhan country, and prepared the way  for the overthrow of the sovereignty of Delhi south of the Vindhyas. I  take it, therefore, that Harihara died in or about the year A.D. 1343.    As to his having reigned quietly, I know of only one statement to the  contrary. An inscription of Samgama II. recording a grant in 1356,  and referred to below, states that Harihara I. \"defeated the Sultan;\"  but perhaps this only alludes to the fact that Muhammad Taghlaq had  to abandon his hold on the country.    The next king was Harihara's brother, Bukka I. (\"Bucarao\"),  and according to Nuniz he reigned thirty-seven years, conquering  in that time all the kingdoms of the south, even including Orissa  (Orya). Without laying too much stress on conquests by force of arms,  it seems certain that most if not all Southern India submitted to  his rule, probably only too anxious to secure a continuance of Hindu  domination in preference to the despotism of the hated followers of  Islam.[33] According to the chronicle, therefore, the death of Bukka  I., as we must call him, took place about the year A.D. 1380. As to  inscriptions of his reign, Dr. Hultzsch[34] mentions that they cover  the period from about 1354 to 1371, while the first inscription  of his successor, Harihara II., is dated in 1379.[35] If, then,  we assume that Bukka I. reigned till 1379, we find the chronicle  so far accurate that Bukka I. did in fact reign thirty-six years,  though not thirty-seven -- A.D. 1343 to 1379.    But meanwhile we have another story from an inscription on  copper-plates which is to be seen preserved in the Collector's office  at Nellore.[36] It has been carefully edited by Mr. H. Krishna  Sastri. According to this it would appear that Bukka I., who  undoubtedly was a man of war, usurped the throne. It asserts that  the father of Harihara I., who was named Samgama, had five sons. The  eldest was Harihara himself, the second Kampa, and the third Bukka. We  want to know who succeeded Harihara. There is extant an inscription  of Bukka dated in 1354, and there is this Nellore inscription dated in  1356. The latter comes from a far-off country near the eastern coast,  and it relates that Kampa succeeded Harihara, and that Samgama II.,  son of Kampa, succeeded his father, and granted a village in the  Nellore district to the Brahmans on a date which corresponds to May  3, A.D. 1356. It implies that Samgama had succeeded his father Kampa  exactly a year previous to the grant. Thus it claims that Kampa was  king from 1343 to 1355. We know nothing more of this, and there is  only one other document at present known to exist which was executed  in the reign either of Kampa or of Samgama This is alluded to by  Mr. Krishna Sastri, who refers us to the colophon of the MADHAVIYA  DHATUVRITTI, according to which its author, Sayanacharya, uterine  brother of the great Madhavacharya, was minister to king Samgama,  son of Kampa. The only possible inference is that the succession to  Harihara was disputed, and that somehow Bukka got the upper hand and  at least as early as 1354 declared himself king, afterwards claiming  to have immediately succeeded Harihara. It will be seen farther on  that in almost every case the kingdom was racked with dissension on  the demise of the sovereign, and that year after year the members of  the reigning family were subjected to violence and murder in order  that one or other of them might establish himself as head of the State.    On the assumption, therefore, that the reign of Bukka I. lasted from  1343 to 1379, we turn to Firishtah to learn what were this king's  relations with the followers of Islam, now supreme on the north of  the Krishna.    Just after his accession, as it would appear, occurred the successful  campaign alluded to above, in which a combination of Hindus from  different States drove back the invaders. Here is Firishtah's  account of what took place.[37] He is speaking of the year A.H. 744,  which lasted from May 26, A.D. 1343, to May 15, 1344, and he says  that Krishna Naik, son of Rudra Deva of Warangal, went privately to  Ballala Deva and urged him to join a combination of Hindus with the  view of driving out the Muhammadans from the Dakhan. The Ballala  prince consented, and Krishna Naik promised, when the preparations  were complete, to raise all the Hindus of Telingana and place himself  at their head.    Ballala Deva then built the city of Vijayanagar,[38] raised an army,  and the war began. Warangal, then in the hands of the Muhammadans,  was reduced, and its governor, Imad-ul-Mulkh, retreated to Daulatabad  or Devagiri. The two chiefs then induced other Rajahs of the Malabar  and Kanara countries to join them, and the joint forces seized the  whole of the Dakhan and expelled the Muhammadans there, \"so that  within a few months Muhammad Taghlak had no possessions in that  quarter except Daulatabad.\"    So far the Muhammadan historian. It is necessary to observe that  this success of the Hindus was only temporary, for their enemies  still swarmed in the Dakhan, and immediately after this contest  the Hindus "]]]
