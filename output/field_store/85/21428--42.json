He  arose and ate of what little was yet left him, and drank of the water of  a stream which he had followed the evening before, and beside which he  had laid him down; and then set forth again with no great hope to come on  new tidings that day.  But yet when he was fairly afoot, himseemed that  there was something new in the air which he breathed, that was soft and  bore sweet scents home to him; whereas heretofore, and that especially  for the last three or four days, it had been harsh and void, like the  face of the desert itself.    So on he went, and presently was mounting the ridge aforesaid, and, as  oft happens when one climbs a steep place, he kept his eyes on the  ground, till he felt he was on the top of the ridge.  Then he stopped to  take breath, and raised his head and looked, and lo! he was verily on the  brow of the great mountain-neck, and down below him was the hanging of  the great hill-slopes, which fell down, not slowly, as those he had been  those days a-mounting, but speedily enough, though with little of broken  places or sheer cliffs.  But beyond this last of the desert there was  before him a lovely land of wooded hills, green plains, and little  valleys, stretching out far and wide, till it ended at last in great blue  mountains and white snowy peaks beyond them.    Then for very surprise of joy his spirit wavered, and he felt faint and  dizzy, so that he was fain to sit down a while and cover his face with  his hands.  Presently he came to his sober mind again, and stood up and  looked forth keenly, and saw no sign of any dwelling of man.  But he said  to himself that that might well be because the good and well-grassed land  was still so far off, and that he might yet look to find men and their  dwellings when he had left the mountain wilderness quite behind him: So  therewith he fell to going his ways down the mountain, and lost little  time therein, whereas he now had his livelihood to look to.          CHAPTER IX: WALTER HAPPENETH ON THE FIRST OF THOSE THREE CREATURES      What with one thing, what with another, as his having to turn out of his  way for sheer rocks, or for slopes so steep that he might not try the  peril of them, and again for bogs impassable, he was fully three days  more before he had quite come out of the stony waste, and by that time,  though he had never lacked water, his scanty victual was quite done, for  all his careful husbandry thereof.  But this troubled him little, whereas  he looked to find wild fruits here and there and to shoot some small  deer, as hare or coney, and make a shift to cook the same, since he had  with him flint and fire-steel.  Moreover the further he went, the surer  he was that he should soon come across a dwelling, so smooth and fair as  everything looked before him.  And he had scant fear, save that he might  happen on men who should enthrall him.    But when he was come down past the first green slopes, he was so worn,  that he said to himself that rest was better than meat, so little as he  had slept for the last three days; so he laid him down under an ash-tree  by a stream-side, nor asked what was o'clock, but had his fill of sleep,  and even when he awoke in the fresh morning was little fain of rising,  but lay betwixt sleeping and waking for some three hours more; then he  arose, and went further down the next green bent, yet somewhat slowly  because of his hunger-weakness.  And the scent of that fair land came up  to him like the odour of one great nosegay.    So he came to where the land was level, and there were many trees, as oak  and ash, and sweet-chestnut and wych-elm, and hornbeam and quicken-tree,  not growing in a close wood or tangled thicket, but set as though in  order on the flowery greensward, even as it might be in a great king's  park.    So came he to a big bird-cherry, whereof many boughs hung low down laden  with fruit: his belly rejoiced at the sight, and he caught hold of a  bough, and fell to plucking and eating.  But whiles he was amidst of  this, he heard suddenly, close anigh him, a strange noise of roaring and  braying, not very great, but exceeding fierce and terrible, and not like  to the voice of any beast that he knew.  As has been aforesaid, Walter  was no faint-heart; but what with the weakness of his travail and hunger,  what with the strangeness of his adventure and his loneliness, his spirit  failed him; he turned round towards the noise, his knees shook and he  trembled: this way and that he looked, and then gave a great cry and  tumbled down in a swoon; for close before him, at his very feet, was the  dwarf whose image he had seen before, clad in his yellow coat, and  grinning up at him from his hideous hairy countenance.    How long he lay there as one dead, he knew not, but when he woke again  there was the dwarf sitting on his hams close by him.  And when he lifted  up his head, the dwarf sent out that fearful harsh voice again; but this  time Walter could make out words therein, and knew that the creature  spoke and said:    \"How now!  What art thou?  Whence comest?  What wantest?\"    Walter sat up and said: \"I am a man; I hight Golden Walter; I come from  Langton; I want victual.\"    Said the dwarf, writhing his face grievously, and laughing forsooth: \"I  know it all: I asked thee to see what wise thou wouldst lie.  I was sent  forth to look for thee; and I have brought thee loathsome bread with me,  such as ye aliens must needs eat: take it!\"    Therewith he drew a loaf from a satchel which he bore, and thrust it  towards Walter, who took it somewhat doubtfully for all his hunger.    The dwarf yelled at him: \"Art thou dainty, alien?  Wouldst thou have  flesh?  Well, give me thy bow and an arrow or two, since thou art lazy-  sick, and I will get thee a coney or a hare, or a quail maybe.  Ah, I  forgot; thou art dainty, and wilt not eat flesh as I do, blood and all  together, but must needs half burn it in the fire, or mar it with hot  water; as they say my Lady does: or as the Wretch, the Thing does; I know  that, for I have seen It eating.\"    \"Nay,\" said Walter, \"this sufficeth;\" and he fell to eating the bread,  which was sweet between his teeth.  Then when he had eaten a while, for  hunger compelled him, he said to the dwarf: \"But what meanest thou by the  Wretch and the Thing?  And what Lady is thy Lady?\"    The creature let out another wordless roar as of furious anger; and then  the words came: \"It hath a face white and red, like to thine; and hands  white as thine, yea, but whiter; and the like it is underneath its  raiment, only whiter still: for I have seen It--yes, I have seen It; ah  yes and yes and yes.\"    And therewith his words ran into gibber and yelling, and he rolled about  and smote at the grass: but in a while he grew quiet again and sat still,  and then fell to laughing horribly again, and then said: \"But thou, fool,  wilt think It fair if thou fallest into Its hands, and wilt repent it  thereafter, as I did.  Oh, the mocking and gibes of It, and the tears and  shrieks of It; and the knife!  What! sayest thou of my Lady?--What Lady?  O alien, what other Lady is there?  And what shall I tell thee of her? it  is like that she made me, as she made the Bear men.  But she made not the  Wretch, the Thing; and she hateth It sorely, as I do.  And some day to  come--\"    Thereat he brake off and fell to wordless yelling a long while, and  thereafter spake all panting: \"Now I have told thee overmuch, and O if my  Lady come to hear thereof.  Now I will go.\"    And therewith he took out two more loaves from his wallet, and tossed  them to Walter, and so turned and went his ways; whiles walking upright,  as Walter had seen his image on the quay of Langton; whiles bounding and  rolling like a ball thrown by a lad; whiles scuttling along on all-fours  like an evil beast, and ever and anon giving forth that harsh and evil  cry.    Walter sat a while after he was out of sight, so stricken with horror and  loathing and a fear of he knew not what, that he might not move.  Then he  plucked up a heart, and looked to his weapons and put the other loaves  into his scrip.    Then he arose and went his ways wondering, yea and dreading, what kind of  creature he should next fall in with.  For soothly it seemed to him that  it would be worse than death if they were all such as this one; and that  if it were so, he must needs slay and be slain.          CHAPTER X: WALTER HAPPENETH ON ANOTHER CREATURE IN THE STRANGE LAND      But as he went on through the fair and sweet land so bright and  sun-litten, and he now rested and fed, the horror and fear ran off from  him, and he wandered on merrily, neither did aught befall him save the  coming of night, when he laid him down under a great spreading oak with  his drawn sword ready to hand, and fell asleep at once, and woke not till  the sun was high.    Then he arose and went on his way again; and the land was no worser than  yesterday; but even better, it might be; the greensward more flowery, the  oaks and chestnuts greater.  Deer of diverse kinds he saw, and might  easily have got his meat thereof; but he meddled not with them since he  had his bread, and was timorous of lighting a fire.  Withal he doubted  little of having some entertainment; and that, might be, nought evil;  since even that fearful dwarf had been courteous to him after his kind,  and had done him good and not harm.  But of the happening on the Wretch  and the Thing, whereof the dwarf spake, he was yet somewhat afeard.    After he had gone a while and whenas the summer morn was at its  brightest, he saw a little way ahead a grey rock rising up from amidst of  a ring of oak-trees; so he turned thither straightway; for in this plain-  land he had seen no rocks heretofore; and as he went he saw that there  was a fountain gushing out from under the rock, which ran thence in a  fair little stream.  And when he had the rock and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#6)"],[1,"ther's wet satin nose, while that devoted  parent washed her family.    But Finn and the rest were sound asleep, and Tara was dozing with  one brown eye uncovered, when the Master came into the den on that  second morning and spoke invitingly to his beloved mother of  heroes. The great bitch rose slowly and with gentle care, and Finn,  with the other sucklings, rolled helplessly on his back, sleepily  cheeping a puny remonstrance, though he had no idea what he wanted.  Then, in his ridiculously masterful way, Finn grovellingly burrowed  under the other puppies, that he might have the benefit of all  their warmth, and was asleep again. Tara eyed the blind things for  a moment with maternal solicitude, and then, seeing that all was  well with them, followed the Master out into the bright, fresh  sunshine of the stable-yard. She did not think about it, but she  was perfectly well aware that it was desirable for her to take  fresh air, and move about a little to stretch her great limbs.    \"Come and see the Mistress, old lady; come along and stretch  yourself,\" said her friend.    And so Tara strolled round the yard twice, and then across to the  back-kitchen door, where, inside the house, she had some warm bread  and milk with the Mistress of the Kennels. Tara lapped steadily and  conscientiously, but without much appetite. Suddenly, when the  basin was about three-quarters empty, she realised with a start  that the Master had left her. One quick look she gave to right and  left, and then, the mother anxiety shining in her brown eyes, she  reached the outer door in a bound.    \"Look out for Tara!\" cried the Mistress through the open window.  And: \"All right! I'm clear now. Let her in, will you?\" answered the  Master, from beyond the gate leading to the coach-house.    So the Mistress opened the house door, and in three cat-like bounds  Tara reached the door of the den, and stood erect, her fore-paws  against the door, more than six feet above the ground.    \"There, there, pet; your children are all right, you see,\" said the  Mistress, as she let Tara into the den.    In a moment, lighter of foot than a terrier, for all that she  weighed as much as an average man, Tara was in the midst of the big  bed, where she saw her puppies bunched snugly and asleep. She  looked up gratefully at the Mistress, as the roused pups (she had  touched them with her nose) came mewing about her feet, and coiled  down at once to nurse them, apparently unconscious of the fact that  there were only four mouths to feed instead of five. One cannot say  for certain whether or not she missed Finn then. She licked the  four assiduously while they nursed; and, in any case, four gaping  little mouths, and four wriggling, helpless little bodies,  represent a considerable claim upon a Wolfhound mother's attention  and strength; also, it may be, that if she did notice that the big  grey whelp was missing, she was too wise and devoted a mother and  nurse to allow herself to injure the remaining four by fretting and  worrying over matters beyond her immediate control. One must  remember, too, that Tara lived in an atmosphere of the most  implicit confidence, in which she never even heard an unkind word.  On the other hand, if there had been no puppies at all on that bed,  when Tara returned from her brief excursion to the back-kitchen,  then it is likely that the big den would not have been strong  enough to have held her for long within its wooden walls. The room  had windows, and match-boarding and weather-board are not like  iron.    Having seen Tara comfortably settled down with her family of four,  the Mistress hurried back to the house in time to see the Master  unwrapping little Finn from a soft old blanket, and placing him  carefully in the midst of three puppies of perhaps half his size,  in a hamper near the kitchen stove. Finn bleated rather languidly  for two minutes in his new environment, and then, being very full  of milk, and very warm, forgot what the trouble was and fell  asleep. The Master closed the lid of the hamper then, and said:--    \"I'll let them have a good two hours together there. Finn ought to  assimilate the smell of the others pretty well by then. What do you  think of the foster?\"    \"Oh, I like her,\" said the Mistress of the Kennels. \"She seems a  nice affectionate little beast, and I think she has quite recovered  from the effects of that awful journey.\"    [Illustration: Finn and his foster-mother]    \"Um! Yes, twelve or fourteen hours' travelling with three new-born  pups must be rather awful--poor little beast! Did she take her  breakfast?\"    \"Yes; a first-rate meal. And I think she will be a good mother. She  seems to have any amount of milk--more than is comfortable for her,  poor little thing!\"    \"Yes; that's exactly what I want. I want her to be uncomfortably  heavy for the time, and then she will be the less likely to resent  my great big Finn's introduction. It's only discomfort, you know,  not pain; and we shall put it right in a couple of hours.\"    \"Then you have decided to put Finn to the foster-mother?\"    \"Yes. You see, poor old Tara--well, she----\"    \"Yes, I know; she's poor old Tara--spoiled darling!\"    The Master chuckled. \"Well, perhaps it is partly that. And, any  way, she deserves it. The old girl has done a good share of prize-winning,  and nursing, and the rest of it. I think of her as a lady  who has earned repose, particularly after----\"    \"Yes, I know; the illness, you mean.\"    \"Well, anyhow, I think four pups quite enough for her to nurse.  And, as a matter of fact, I am none too comfortable about that. You  know I have always believed that that awful bout of mammitis  permanently affected her; her heart, and----and other things, too.  Four days with a temperature of over a hundred and five, you know;  and, mind you, the vet. said she must die. It was, so to say, in  spite of Nature that we pulled her through. I am not at all sure  that we may not have to take them all from her. We shall see better  by to-night.\"    \"Yes; I see.\" The Mistress of the Kennels was thoughtfully  balancing on the tip of her fore-finger a big wooden spoon, used in  the mixing of Tara's meals. \"But why do you choose Finn for the  foster?\"    \"Well, now, that's rather a nice point, and involves a conviction  of mine which I know you'll resent, because you rightly think Tara  the perfection of all that a Wolfhound should be. But the  conviction is right, all the same. A mongrel's milk is far  stronger, heartier food than the milk of so highly-bred a great  lady as dear old Tara. Tara gives the most aristocratic blood in  the world; but when you come to food, the nourishment that is to  build up bone and muscle, and hardy health--that's different. Also,  I only mean to give the foster this one pup, though I dare say she  is capable of rearing two or three. Therefore that one pup ought to  do exceedingly well with her. Now Finn, as you see him, is the  biggest pup I ever knew, and I want to give him every chance of  growing into the biggest Irish Wolfhound living. That's why he is  going to have this sheep-dog foster all to his little self, and,  unless I'm mistaken, you'll find him in a week the fattest little  tub of a pup in all England--the fatter the better at this stage,  so the food's wholesome and digestible.\"    In about one hour from that time, Finn woke among his strange  bedfellows, and trampled all over them, in a vain and wrathful  search for his mother's dugs. Then he bleated vigorously for three  minutes; and then the warmth of that snug corner of the kitchen  sent him off to sleep again.    Another hour passed, and when Finn woke this time one could tell  from the furious lunges he made over the little bodies of his  foster-brothers that he had arrived at a serious determination to  let nothing stand any longer between himself and a good square  meal. He would take one indignant step forward (as it might have  been a rather gouty and very choleric old gentleman, prepared to  tear down his bell-rope if dinner were not served that minute);  then his podgy little fore-legs would double up, and the next few  inches of progress would be made on blunt little pink nose, and  round little stomach, his hind-legs being flattened out behind him  in the exact position of a frog's while swimming. Several times  Finn quite thought he had at length found a teat, and, in its  infantile, impotent way, the blind fury he displayed was quite  terrible, when he discovered that he was merely chewing the muzzle  of one of the other pups. On one of these occasions, Finn  spluttered and swore so vehemently that the effort completely  robbed him of what rudimentary sense of balance he had, and he  rolled over on his back, leaving all his four pink feet wriggling  in the air in a passion of protest.    It was in this undignified position that the Master presently found  the grey whelp, and he chuckled as he picked up Finn, with two of  the other pups, and wrapped them together in a warm blanket. The  remaining puppy was handed over to the gardener and seen no more in  that place; so it is safe to assume that this little creature's  life embraced no sorrows or disillusions. The next thing Finn knew  was that his gaping mouth, held open by the Master's thumb and  forefinger, was being pressed against a soft surface from which  warm milk trickled. \"At last!\" one can imagine Finn muttering, if  he had been old enough to know how to talk. Immediately his little  hind-legs began to work like pistons, and his fore-paws to knead  and pound at the soft udder from which the milk was drawn. Finn,  with his two foster-brothers, was at the dugs of the foster-mother,  a soft-eyed little sheep-dog, then occupying a very comfortable  corner of the big bed in the coach-house.    The Master sat watchfully beside the sheep-dog. She was very glad  to be eased of some of her superabundance of milk, and curved her  elastic body forward to"]]]
