You won't have to let them know that you are coming; they will see you  long before you see them, and from their little nests they will begin to  scold you, for fear that you mean to do them harm.    When they see that you mean them no harm, they will begin to entertain  you with their songs. Oh, how they do sing! It just seems as though they  would burst with song.    You can see how happy the one is in the picture. The other little fellow  will soon take his turn. See how straight he holds his tail up. Find out  all you can about these Wrens. You notice they have long bills. We call  them Long-billed Marsh Wrens. There are several other kinds. You surely  must have seen their cousins, the House Wrens. I will show you their  pictures some day.          THE ARIZONA GREEN JAY.      The geographical range of the Arizona Jay is in southern New Mexico and  Arizona and south into Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico. It is a common  resident throughout the oak belt which generally fringes the foothills  of the mountains and ranges well up among the pines. In suitable  localities it is very abundant. It is rarely seen at any distance out of  the arid plains; but after the breeding season is over, small flocks are  sometimes met with among the shrubbery of the few water courses, several  miles away from their regular habitat. They are seen in the early  Spring, evidently on a raid for eggs and the young of smaller birds. On  such occasions they are very silent, and their presence is only betrayed  by the scoldings they receive from other birds. On their own heath they  are as noisy as any of our Jays, and apparently far more sociable, a  number of pairs frequently nesting close to each other in a small oak  grove. They move about in small family parties of from half a dozen to  twenty or thirty, being rarely seen alone. They are restless, constantly  on the move, prying into this or that, spending a good portion of their  time on the ground, now hopping on a low limb, and the next minute down  again, twitching their tails almost constantly. Their call notes are  harsh and far reaching, and are somewhat similar to those of the  California Jay.    The voices of animals have a family character not easily mistaken, and  this similarity is especially observable in birds. As Agassiz says,  \"Compare all the sweet warbles of the songster family--the  nightingales, the thrushes, the mocking birds, the robins; they differ  in the greater or lesser perfection of their note, but the same kind of  voice runs through the whole group. Does not every member of the Crow  family caw, whether it be a Jackdaw, the Jay, or the Magpie, the Rook in  some green rookery of the Old World, or the Crow of our woods, with its  long melancholy caw that seems to make the silence and solitude deeper?\"    The habits of the Arizona Jay are similar to those of its brethren. Its  food consists of grasshoppers, insects, animal matter, wild fruits,  seeds, and especially acorns. It flies by partly closing its wings,  darting suddenly down, then up again, and repeating these movements for  some time. It mates about the end of February. The nest, composed of dry  rootlets laid very closely in rings, is usually found in an oak sapling  about ten feet from the ground. The inside diameter is five inches, and  depth one and three-fourths inches. It is like a deep saucer.    The Arizona Jay is considered a foothill bird, not going far into the  pines and not appearing on the plains. But one brood appears to be  raised in a season, and nesting lasts about sixteen days. The eggs vary  from four to seven, and differ from all the known eggs of this family  found within the United States, being unspotted. They are glaucous green  in color, and the majority are much more glossy than Jays' eggs  generally are. In one hundred and thirty-six specimens examined, all  were perfectly immaculate.

To this he did  not rap out 'salmon,' as we had all expected--good as it was to the  smell, but 'erst riechen' (first let me smell it). This was a ruse on  his part, and one to which I succumbed, for no sooner did I hold it  nearer to his nose than he snatched it out of my hand! It was, however,  promptly taken from him and he was told he would have to 'deserve it'  first. In the meantime a young female dog had come into the room--she  answered to the name of Lola, and I asked Rolf if Lola might come with  me. His reply was a most decided 'No!' I put some further questions to  him, and Frau von Moers particularly asked him: 'Is Lola clever? Is  Lola to learn?' to which he made answer: 'Lola is clever, but she is  not to learn because of the professors'--and he actually made a face,  apparently he was thinking of his own experiences. I laughed, and said:    \"'Lola shall have a good time with me; she shall run about in the woods  and the meadows, and play with a lot of other animals, and not have to  work too long; the professors shall be sent away when Lola is tired.'  This evidently pleased him, and he became very friendly to me, and on  my returning to my point and asking once more whether Lola might go  with me, he rapped out his answer on my hand: it was 'Yes!'    \"Then I told him about an ox, who, when he didn't want to work,  pretended to be dead. Rolf now got very excited, and wanted to go on  rapping--first on my hand, and then on the leather-covered sofa on  which I was sitting. I became rather uneasy and got him to go and rap  to Fraeulein Moekel, for I could then follow the raps far better. And  what he now had to say referred to the deceitful ox--it was: \"Hat  Recht: Lol immer sagen Bauchweh!\" ( = Quite right of him! Lol always  says he has a pain in his stomach!)    \"After this I showed him another box of biscuits, with a picture of a  little nigger-boy on the lid, and asked:    \"'What do you see on this?'    \"To which he eagerly replied:    \"'Wuest schwarz Bub!' ( = A wild black boy!)    \"Rolf then received his reward, and I took a grateful leave of the  Moekels--accompanied by little Lola.    \"This experience of coming into personal contact with Rolf's powers of  self-expression made a deep and lasting impression on me. In spite of  all the accounts I had read and heard this living proof was almost  overpowering in its utter novelty, and in the feeling of emotion that  came over me, I seemed to sense that 'Souls' Unrest' that a transition  from the old conception of 'unreasoning' animals to this new cognition  is bound to bring with it.    \"My visit had been so short that I had not been able to put any  questions as to the method of instruction pursued. I had not been able  to experiment personally nor get any actual advice, for Frau Dr. Moekel  had died in the autumn of 1915. Yet I was by no means displeased at my  state of ignorance when I came to reflect on the matter, for it enabled  me to 'blaze a trail,' as it were, according to my own way of thinking,  perhaps even, enabling me to arrive accidentally at similar or,  diametrically opposite results!\"          LOLA      Lola is an Airedale terrier, born at Mannheim on 27 January, 1914, a  daughter of Rolf, and of the equally thorough-bred Jela. Both these  dogs were owned by the family of a barrister, Dr. Moekel. The Airedale  terrier resembles the dog we call a \"Schnauzer\"; it is wire-haired and  of medium growth; generally with a greyish-black coat and yellow feet.  Its head is covered with silky curls beneath which two bright eyes are  seen. These dogs are distinguished for their alert and attentive  bearing, while their excellent constitution renders them specially  suitable for being trained to useful pursuits; they are at the same  time not an over-bred race. Professor Heck, writing on the subject of  these dogs (see \"Communications of the Society for Animal Psychology\"),  says:    \"We are indebted to Herr Gutbrod of Bradford for the fact that this dog  has already become fairly well distributed among us. If I have been  rightly informed regarding the Airedale's history it is a crossbreed  between the otter-hound and the bull-terrier, this strain having been  originally obtained by the factory hands of Airedale in the North of  England, who thus sought to obtain a hardy dog--one not afraid of  water, and that would prove a useful assistant when out poaching either  water-fowl, hares or rabbits, occasions on which it is of importance to  carry out the work with as little noise as possible.    \"This breed provides a favourite 'house dog'; they have proved  invaluable as Army Medical Service dogs, and are friendly with  children. Jocularly they are called (in Germany) Petroleum dogs ( = a  play on the name Airedale, as pronounced in German, i.e. 'Erd-oel'\").    As already said, Lola's parents were the much spoken-of Rolf, the  so-called \"thinking\" or \"speaking\" dog, and Jela, no longer owned by  the Moekels. Jela seems to have been an unimportant little animal, not  even very affectionate as a mother. The litter Lola was dropped at  consisted of twelve pups; of these one died at once, and after the  vicissitudes puppies are heirs to, those that remained and have become  known to us, are Heinz, Harras, Ilse, and Lola. The first-named three  all have their different owners by whom they are being taught with a  certain amount of success--as indeed their reports have shown.    Previously to coming into my possession, Lola, had been removed from  Mannheim at an early age, and had passed through many hands,  undergoing, moreover, the most various attempts of instruction. Lack of  time and also the war, had been answerable for these changes; twice,  however, her own fidgetiness had resulted in her being deemed  unsuitable, and it was felt that the attempt had proved a failure. Even  Frau Dr. Moekel, into whose hands she had finally returned is said not  to have thought much of her, having only been able to get her to learn  \"yes\" ( = 2), and \"no\" ( = 3). I mention this, because it became clear to  me later on that the success of such teaching does not depend solely on  the patience, the love and the attention, nor even on the ability to,  or the faculty for sensing the feelings of other creatures: not on the  sympathy nor yet on the calm of individual persons, but rather on _a  particular person being suited to a particular dog_.    No matter how great the ability of both the individual and the dog may  be, should their temperaments not be in accord--every attempt will be  fruitless. For instance, I feel very sure that I could not have taught  Rolf; also that I shall never be able to get a sheep-dog (I still  possess) to do more than answer \"yes\" and \"no\"; also that it would be  the easiest thing for me to instruct Lola's daughter Ula--and so forth.  There are, in short, \"winners\" and \"blanks\" and betwixt the two, every  grade of differentiation. Yet, is this not equally true in the case of  teaching children? The best of teachers need not prove equally suitable  to all his pupils, while some other will turn out to be exactly the  right person. And this only shows us the difficulties which so  frequently obstruct the path of the best-intentioned people--where  investigations are concerned; obstructions which they themselves  oft-times do not notice, and to which no thought is given by prejudiced  persons. For with animals we come up against a more acute degree of  sensitiveness than we do in a child, which, owing to certain rudiments  of common sense, is able to adapt itself more easily to either teacher  or investigator.    Lola had remained with the Moekels for some time after the decease of  that estimable lady; it was, however, ultimately found desirable to  find other homes for some of the dogs. It was about that time that my  inquiry as to the possibility of procuring a descendant of Rolf reached  Professor Ziegler, and he at once seconded my application. Thus Lola  was kindly placed at my disposal. At first I felt some misgivings owing  to the fact that the dog was already two years old, and had also passed  through numerous hands, yet I determined to go to Mannheim, and my  visit took place as above narrated. Lola made a most delightful  impression on me, and I put few tests to my choice, for I was in a  state of some excitement after all that had taken place, and therefore  took her away with me joyfully. It had seemed as if I _must_ do this.    It was on 11 January, 1916. She sat in the railway carriage with me,  and began to howl violently when she saw Mannheim disappearing from her  gaze. I tried to console her, saying: \"Don't cry! You shall be quite  happy with me!\" It was then that Lola looked at me for the first time  attentively. She quieted down and our friendship seemed sealed. She was  apparently resigned to her fate; she was also doubtless aware that she  had played \"second fiddle\" at Mannheim, and that it would, therefore,  be preferable to be somewhere \"on her own.\" That something of the kind  was passing through her mind I could see--also that she was quite aware  that she now belonged to me, and imagined she would be alone with me.  This latter surmise became evident as soon as we reached my home where  the sheep-dog I had had for two years rushed out to welcome me.    Then Lola gazed at me with horror and disappointment; the reproach in  her eyes was such that I could not but understand, and then--the two  dogs flew at each other, for, in the meantime the sheep-dog had begun  to understand too! This was remarkable, for male and female dogs do not  as a rule fall foul of each other. For days I kept them apart in  separate rooms, for the mere sight of each other occasioned deep  growls--indeed, my position had become distinctly uncomfortable. Then I  suddenly remembered having heard that if two"]]]
