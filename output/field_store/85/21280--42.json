Our food is sent to us on the range three times a week. A  camp-tender comes on horseback bringing supplies on a packhorse or on a  little Mexican burro. If we are not too far up in the hills this tender  fetches the food all the way; if we are, he leaves it in some spot  agreed upon and we go down and get it, leaving the flocks in care of the  dogs. The schooners stay near enough to the home ranch so they can go  back and forth now and then and get restocked. We ourselves take a few  pots and pans to the range--just enough so we can cook our meals. It is  like camping out anywhere else.\"    \"I love camping!\" cut in Donald.    \"Then you'll like the range for certain.\"    \"I know I shall. I hope I can go. What a lot I am learning, Sandy!  Pretty soon I shall know more about sheep-raising than father does!\"    \"Dinna fret yourself about your father,\" was Sandy's dry retort. \"He  needs no pity. He can take care of himself.\"    Tom Thornton, however, did not seem to agree with Sandy's estimate of  his employer. The moment he was back from Glen City he sought out Mr.  Clark who, with Donald, was sitting before the fire in the barren  living-room.    \"The clip is off for the East at last, Mr. Clark,\" he said. \"It is  likely you will be following it soon yourself now that you have cast  your eye over the ranch and found it running all right. Have you come to  any decision as to who you'll appoint as manager?\"    Thornton glanced keenly at the ranch owner as he put his question.    \"I do not think I shall appoint any manager at present, Thornton,\"  replied Mr. Clark slowly. \"I am in no haste to return East. Donald and I  are enjoying our holiday here tremendously and for a while, at least, I  think I shall stay and manage Crescent Ranch myself.\"    Thornton drew a quick breath.    It was evident that he was amazed and none too well pleased.    \"It is hard work, sir--especially when you are not used to it.\"    \"I am accustomed to hard work.\"    \"The men will take advantage of you, sir--if I may be so bold as to say  so. They know you were not brought up to sheeping. They will impose on  you and shirk their duties.\"    \"I am not afraid, Thornton,\" was the calm reply. \"I have had a chance to  test what they would do when they were dipping the sheep. It was as  thorough a piece of work as one would wish to see done, and went  smoothly as a sled in iced ruts. I never saw better team-work. Sandy  directed things most ably.\"    \"Sandy does well enough at times,\" was Thornton's grudging answer, \"but  you are depending on him too much. You may regret it later.\"    \"I doubt it.\"    Thornton turned.    \"Wait and see,\" was his curt reply.    After he had gone out Donald rose and came to his father's side.    \"Thornton doesn't like Sandy, father.\"    \"I am afraid he doesn't, Don.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Think of a reason.\"    \"Because Sandy is the son of Old Angus--is it that?\"    \"Possibly,\" responded Mr. Clark, \"and yet I think it is not wholly  that.\"    \"Because Sandy is so good?\"    \"Perhaps.\"    \"Because we both like Sandy so much?\" persisted the boy.    \"I shouldn't wonder.\"    \"Well, I don't see how any one could help liking Sandy! He is the best  man on the place. He knows so much, and is so full of fun, father! And  he is so kind to his dogs and to the sheep! Why, I believe he loves  every sheep on Crescent Ranch.\"    \"I am sure of it.\"    There was a silence.    \"Father,\" burst out Donald when he could bear the silence no longer, \"I  believe Thornton wants you to appoint him manager of our ranch.\"    Mr. Clark's face lighted with pleasure.    \"I am glad to hear you call it our ranch, Don,\" he said. \"I want you to  grow up and go to college and afterward I wish you to choose some useful  work in the world. Whatever honorable thing you elect to do I shall  gladly help you to carry out. But if it happened--not that I should ever  urge it--but if it happened that by and by you wanted to take part of  the care of this ranch on your shoulders it would make me very glad.\"    \"I am sure I should like to,\" cried Donald impulsively.    \"No, no,\" his father responded, shaking his head. \"Do not give your  word so thoughtlessly. It is a serious matter to choose what you will do  in life. You must take a long time to think about it--years, perhaps.  You are only fourteen. There will be many an idea popping in and out of  your head between now and the time you are twenty. Just stow the thought  away; take it out sometimes, turn it over, and put it back again.\"    \"I will, father.\"    \"And now, just for a moment, let us suppose you really are twenty and  are helping me with the ranch. The first thing we should be doing now  would be trying to make up our minds about this new manager.\"    \"Yes, I suppose we should.\"    \"What should you say about that?\"    \"I wouldn't appoint Thornton, father!\"    His father smiled at the instant decision.    \"You must not be so positive in condemning Thornton, Don. We must be  careful that we are right before we turn him down. To have the care of  Crescent Ranch is a responsible position. We want a faithful  man--somebody we can trust when we are in the East; somebody who will  run the ranch exactly as if we were here.\"    \"Thornton wouldn't!\"    \"That is what I am trying to find out,\" Mr. Clark said.    \"Have you anybody in mind, father--anybody beside Thornton?\"    Mr. Clark fingered his watch-chain.    \"I am watching my men, Don. It is the little things a man does rather  than the big things that tell others what he is. Remember that. Watch  the little things.\"    \"I didn't know you were watching anybody at all,\" avowed Donald. \"You  did not seem to be doing much but wander round and have a good time.\"    \"I am glad of that,\" answered his father.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER V    THORNTON HAS A REPRIMAND      Donald had now been long enough at the ranch so that he had discovered a  number of ways in which he could be of use. Most of his efforts, to be  sure, were confined to aiding Sandy; but as Sandy had almost more work  than he could do he greatly appreciated the boy's help. Donald carried  meal to the feeding-troughs, fed the dogs, ran errands, and carried  messages from one pasture to another. He was not a little proud when one  day Sandy bestowed on him the title of first assistant. To think of  being the assistant of Sandy McCulloch! Donald's heart bounded! Of  course he got tired. The days were long and the work was real. It was,  however, good wholesome work in the open air--work that made his muscles  ache at first and then grow steadily stronger.    One evening after he had put in an unusually active day and was sitting  in the lamplight with his father Sandy came to the door of the room and  asked:    \"Might I come in and speak to you and Donald, Mr. Clark?\"    Mr. Clark laid down his book. He always enjoyed a talk with Sandy.    \"Certainly,\" he answered. \"Come up by the fire, Sandy. The chilly  evenings still hang on, don't they?\"    \"They do so. I'm thinking, Mr. Clark, that now Thornton is back again it  is time I started for the range. Some of the herders have gone already,  as you know; the rest will be off to-morrow. I ought to be getting under  way soon if I want to land my flock in high, cool pasturage before the  heat comes.\"    \"Very true, Sandy. I have kept you behind because your aid in starting  off the wagons and the other herders was invaluable. But, as you say,  there is no need to detain you longer. How soon could you get away?\"    \"I could start to-morrow if I had my permit.\"    \"How is that?\"    \"As you remember, sir, we must have permits to graze on the range. You  have paid enough money to the government to realize that.\"    \"Yes, indeed. And I never grudge the money, either.\"    \"What are permits, Sandy?\" put in Donald eagerly.    \"Well, laddie, long ago people who raised horses and sheep wandered over  all the mountainsides with their herds, and fed them wherever grass was  plenty. It was free land. Anybody could graze there. It was a fine thing  for a man with thousands of sheep not to have to pay a cent for their  food, wasn't it?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"You would have thought there would have been enough for everybody to  feed their stock peaceably, wouldn't you?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\"    \"Well now, it didn't work out so at all. The sheepmen and the cattlemen  came to actual war. The cattlemen declared that their herds would not  graze where the sheep had been because of some queer odor the sheep left  behind them; they argued, moreover, that sheep gnawed the grass off so  close to the roots that they destroyed the crop and left barren land.  The sheepmen, on the other hand, complained because the cattle--loving  to stand in the water--waded into the water-holes and spoiled them. Each  faction tried to crowd the other off the range. Dreadful things  happened. Vaqueros, or cowboys, would dash on horseback right into the  midst of a flock and scatter the sheep in every direction. Often many of  the sheep fled into the hills and their owners never could find them  again. Or sometimes the cowboys would drive the sheep ahead of them over  high precipices. Cattlemen, being on horseback, had a great scorn for  sheep-herders, who were obliged to trail their flocks on foot. The feud  between the two varieties of stock-raisers became worse and worse.\"    Donald listened breathlessly.    \"More men took up stock-raising as time went on, and in consequence more  herds were turned onto the range. Soon the results began to show. The  young trees of the forest lands were trampled down, or nibbled and  destroyed; water-holes, which the settlers had used as their water  supply, began to be polluted; homesteaders, who had built houses and  settled in the sheep-raising districts, were driven off the range and  had no place where they could be sure of feeding their flocks. The worst  evil, though, was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#6)"],[1,"sent by distant kings,  And merchants with their precious things  With banners o'er her roofs that play,  And weapons that a hundred slay;(68)  All warlike engines framed by man,  And every class of artisan.  A city rich beyond compare  With bards and minstrels gathered there,  And men and damsels who entrance  The soul with play and song and dance.  In every street is heard the lute,  The drum, the tabret, and the flute,  The Veda chanted soft and low,  The ringing of the archer's bow;  With bands of godlike heroes skilled  In every warlike weapon, filled,  And kept by warriors from the foe,  As Nagas guard their home below.(69)  There wisest Brahmans evermore    The flame of worship feed,  And versed in all the Vedas' lore,    Their lives of virtue lead.  Truthful and pure, they freely give;    They keep each sense controlled,  And in their holy fervour live    Like the great saints of old.          Canto VI. The King.      There reigned a king of name revered,  To country and to town endeared,  Great Dasaratha, good and sage,  Well read in Scripture's holy page:  Upon his kingdom's weal intent,  Mighty and brave and provident;  The pride of old Ikshvaku's seed  For lofty thought and righteous deed.  Peer of the saints, for virtues famed,  For foes subdued and passions tamed:  A rival in his wealth untold  Of Indra and the Lord of Gold.  Like Manu first of kings, he reigned,  And worthily his state maintained.  For firm and just and ever true  Love, duty, gain he kept in view,  And ruled his city rich and free,  Like Indra's Amaravati.  And worthy of so fair a place  There dwelt a just and happy race    With troops of children blest.  Each man contented sought no more,  Nor longed with envy for the store    By richer friends possessed.  For poverty was there unknown,  And each man counted as his own    Kine, steeds, and gold, and grain.  All dressed in raiment bright and clean,  And every townsman might be seen    With earrings, wreath, or chain.  None deigned to feed on broken fare,  And none was false or stingy there.  A piece of gold, the smallest pay,  Was earned by labour for a day.  On every arm were bracelets worn,  And none was faithless or forsworn,    A braggart or unkind.  None lived upon another's wealth,  None pined with dread or broken health,    Or dark disease of mind.  High-souled were all. The slanderous word,  The boastful lie, were never heard.  Each man was constant to his vows,  And lived devoted to his spouse.  No other love his fancy knew,  And she was tender, kind, and true.  Her dames were fair of form and face,  With charm of wit and gentle grace,  With modest raiment simply neat,  And winning manners soft and sweet.  The twice-born sages, whose delight  Was Scripture's page and holy rite,  Their calm and settled course pursued,  Nor sought the menial multitude.  In many a Scripture each was versed,  And each the flame of worship nursed,    And gave with lavish hand.  Each paid to Heaven the offerings due,  And none was godless or untrue    In all that holy band.  To Brahmans, as the laws ordain,  The Warrior caste were ever fain    The reverence due to pay;  And these the Vaisyas' peaceful crowd,  Who trade and toil for gain, were proud    To honour and obey;  And all were by the Sudras(70) served,  Who never from their duty swerved,  Their proper worship all addressed  To Brahman, spirits, God, and guest.  Pure and unmixt their rites remained,  Their race's honour ne'er was stained.(71)  Cheered by his grandsons, sons, and wife,  Each passed a long and happy life.  Thus was that famous city held  By one who all his race excelled,    Blest in his gentle reign,  As the whole land aforetime swayed  By Manu, prince of men, obeyed    Her king from main to main.  And heroes kept her, strong and brave,  As lions guard their mountain cave:  Fierce as devouring flame they burned,  And fought till death, but never turned.  Horses had she of noblest breed,  Like Indra's for their form and speed,  From Vahli's(72) hills and Sindhu's(73) sand,  Vanayu(74) and Kamboja's land.(75)  Her noble elephants had strayed  Through Vindhyan and Himalayan shade,  Gigantic in their bulk and height,  Yet gentle in their matchless might.  They rivalled well the world-spread fame  Of the great stock from which they came,    Of Vaman, vast of size,  Of Mahapadma's glorious line,  Thine, Anjan, and, Airavat, thine.(76)    Upholders of the skies.  With those, enrolled in fourfold class,  Who all their mighty kin surpass,    Whom men Matangas name,  And Mrigas spotted black and white,  And Bhadras of unwearied might,  And Mandras hard to tame.(77)  Thus, worthy of the name she bore,(78)  Ayodhya for a league or more    Cast a bright glory round,  Where Dasaratha wise and great  Governed his fair ancestral state,    With every virtue crowned.  Like Indra in the skies he reigned  In that good town whose wall contained    High domes and turrets proud,  With gates and arcs of triumph decked,  And sturdy barriers to protect    Her gay and countless crowd.          Canto VII. The Ministers.      Two sages, holy saints, had he,  His ministers and priests to be:  Vasishtha, faithful to advise,  And Vamadeva, Scripture-wise.  Eight other lords around him stood,  All skilled to counsel, wise and good:  Jayanta, Vijay, Dhrishti bold  In fight, affairs of war controlled:  Siddharth and Arthasadhak true  Watched o'er expense and revenue,  And Dharmapal and wise Asok  Of right and law and justice spoke.  With these the sage Sumantra, skilled  To urge the car, high station filled.    All these in knowledge duly trained  Each passion and each sense restrained:  With modest manners, nobly bred  Each plan and nod and look they read,  Upon their neighbours' good intent,  Most active and benevolent:  As sit the Vasus(79) round their king,  They sate around him counselling.  They ne'er in virtue's loftier pride  Another's lowly gifts decried.  In fair and seemly garb arrayed,  No weak uncertain plans they made.  Well skilled in business, fair and just,  They gained the people's love and trust,  And thus without oppression stored  The swelling treasury of their lord.  Bound in sweet friendship each to each,  They spoke kind thoughts in gentle speech.  They looked alike with equal eye  On every caste, on low and high.  Devoted to their king, they sought,  Ere his tongue spoke, to learn his thought,  And knew, as each occasion rose,  To hide their counsel or disclose.  In foreign lands or in their own  Whatever passed, to them was known.  By secret spies they timely knew  What men were doing or would do.  Skilled in the grounds of war and peace  They saw the monarch's state increase,  Watching his weal with conquering eye  That never let occasion by,  While nature lent her aid to bless  Their labours with unbought success.  Never for anger, lust, or gain,  Would they their lips with falsehood stain.  Inclined to mercy they could scan  The weakness and the strength of man.  They fairly judged both high and low,  And ne'er would wrong a guiltless foe;  Yet if a fault were proved, each one  Would punish e'en his own dear son.  But there and in the kingdom's bound  No thief or man impure was found:  None of loose life or evil fame,  No tempter of another's dame.  Contented with their lot each caste  Calm days in blissful quiet passed;  And, all in fitting tasks employed,  Country and town deep rest enjoyed,  With these wise lords around his throne    The monarch justly reigned,  And making every heart his own    The love of all men gained.  With trusty agents, as beseems,    Each distant realm he scanned,  As the sun visits with his beams    Each corner of the land.  Ne'er would he on a mightier foe    With hostile troops advance,  Nor at an equal strike a blow    In war's delusive chance.  These lords in council bore their part  With ready brain and faithful heart,  With skill and knowledge, sense and tact,  Good to advise and bold to act.  And high and endless fame he won    With these to guide his schemes,  As, risen in his might, the sun    Wins glory with his beams.          Canto VIII. Sumantra's Speech.      But splendid, just, and great of mind,  The childless king for offspring pined.  No son had he his name to grace,  Transmitter of his royal race.  Long had his anxious bosom wrought,  And as he pondered rose the thought:  \"A votive steed 'twere good to slay,  So might a son the gift repay.\"  Before his lords his plan he laid,  And bade them with their wisdom aid:  Then with these words Sumantra, best  Of royal counsellors, addressed:  \"Hither, Vasishtha at their head,  Let all my priestly guides be led.\"    To him Sumantra made reply:  \"Hear, Sire, a tale of days gone by.  To many a sage in time of old,  Sanatkumar, the saint, foretold  How from thine ancient line, O King,  A son, when years came round, should spring.  \"Here dwells,\" 'twas thus the seer began,  \"Of Kasyap's(80) race, a holy man,  Vibhandak named: to him shall spring  A son, the famous Rishyasring.  Bred with the deer that round him roam,  The wood shall be that hermit's home.  To him no mortal shall be known  Except his holy sire alone.  Still by those laws shall he abide  Which lives of youthful Brahmans guide,  Obedient to the strictest rule  That forms the young ascetic's school:  And all the wondering world shall hear  Of his stern life and penance drear;  His care to nurse the holy fire  And do the bidding of his sire.  Then, seated on the Angas'(81) throne,  Shall Lomapad to fame be known.  But folly wrought by that great king  A plague upon the land shall bring;  No rain for many a year shall fall  And grievous drought shall ruin all.  The troubled king with many a prayer  Shall bid the priests some cure declare:  \"The lore of Heaven 'tis yours to know,  Nor are ye blind to things below:  Declare, O holy men, the way  This plague to expiate and stay.\"  Those best of Brahmans shall reply:  \"By every art, O Monarch, try  Hither to bring Vibhandak's"]]]
