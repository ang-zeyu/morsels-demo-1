Another peculiarity of Scott's poetry which made powerfully for its  popularity, was its spirited meter. People were weary of the heroic  couplet, and turned eagerly to these hurried verses, that went on their  way with the sharp tramp of moss-troopers, and heated the blood like a  drum. The meters of Coleridge, subtle, delicate, and poignant, had been  passed by with indifference--had not been heard perhaps, for lack of  ears trained to hear; but Scott's metrical effects were such as a child  could appreciate, and a soldier could carry in his head.    Analogous to this treatment of meter, though belonging to a less formal  side of his art, was Scott's treatment of nature, the landscape setting  of his stories. Perhaps the most obvious feature of the romantic revival  was a reawakening of interest in out-door nature. It was as if for a  hundred years past people had been stricken blind as soon as they passed  from the city streets into the country. A trim garden, an artfully  placed country house, a well-kept preserve, they might see; but for the  great shaggy world of mountain and sea--it had been shut out of man's  elegant vision. Before Scott began to write there had been no lack of  prophets of the new nature-worship, but none of them of a sort to catch  the general ear. Wordsworth's pantheism was too mystical, too delicate  and intuitive, to recommend itself to any but chosen spirits; Crabbe's  descriptions were too minute, Coleridge's too intense, to please. Scott  was the first to paint nature with a broad, free touch, without raptures  or philosophizing, but with a healthy pleasure in its obvious beauties,  such as appeal to average men. His \"scenery\" seldom exists for its own  sake, but serves, as it should, for background and setting of his story.  As his readers followed the fortunes of William of Deloraine or Roderick  Dhu, they traversed by sunlight and by moonlight landscapes of wild  romantic charm, and felt their beauty quite naturally, as a part of the  excitement of that wild life. They felt it the more readily because of a  touch of artificial stateliness in the handling, a slight theatrical  heightening of effect--from an absolute point of view a defect, but  highly congenial to the taste of the time. It was the scenic side of  nature which Scott gave, and gave inimitably, while Burns was piercing  to the inner heart of her tenderness in his lines \"To a Mountain Daisy\"  and \"To a Mouse,\" while Wordsworth was mystically communing with her  soul, in his \"Tintern Abbey.\" It was the scenic side of nature for which  the perceptions of men were ripe; so they left profounder poets to their  musings, and followed after the poet who could give them a brilliant  story set in a brilliant scene.    Again, the emotional key to Scott's poetry was on a comprehensible  plane. The situations with which he deals, the passions, ambitions,  satisfactions, which he portrays, belong, in one form or another, to all  men, or at least are easily grasped by the imaginations of all men. It  has often been said that Scott is the most Homeric of English poets; so  far as the claim rests on considerations of style, it is hardly to be  granted, for nothing could be farther than the hurrying torrent of  Scott's verse from the \"long and refluent music\" of Homer. But in this  other respect, that he deals in the rudimentary stuff of human character  in a straightforward way, without a hint of modern complexities and  super-subtleties, he is really akin to the master poet of antiquity.  This, added to the crude wild life which he pictures, the vigorous sweep  of his action, the sincere glow of romance which bathes his story--all  so tonic in their effect upon minds long used to the stuffy decorum of  didactic poetry, completed the triumph of _The Lay of the Last  Minstrel_, _Marmion_, and _The Lady of the Lake_, over their age.    As has been already suggested, Scott cannot be put in the first rank of  poets. No compromise can be made on this point, because upon it the  whole theory of poetry depends. Neither on the formal nor on the  essential sides of his art is he among the small company of the supreme.  And no one understood this better than himself. He touched the keynote  of his own power, though with too great modesty, when he said, \"I am  sensible that if there is anything good about my poetry ... it is a  hurried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers, sailors, and  young people of bold and active dispositions.\" The poet Campbell, who  was so fascinated by Scott's ballad of \"Cadyow Castle\" that he used to  repeat it aloud on the North Bridge of Edinburgh until \"the whole  fraternity of coachmen knew him by tongue as he passed,\" characterizes  the predominant charm of Scott's poetry as lying in a \"strong, pithy  eloquence,\" which is perhaps only another name for \"hurried frankness of  composition.\" If this is not the highest quality to which poetry can  attain, it is a very admirable one; and it will be a sad day for the  English-speaking race when there shall not be found persons of every age  and walk of life, to take the same delights in these stirring poems as  their author loved to think was taken by \"soldiers, sailors, and young  people of bold and active dispositions.\"          III. THE LADY OF THE LAKE      1. HISTORICAL SETTING    _The Lady of the Lake_ deals with a distinct epoch in the life of King  James V of Scotland, and has lying back of it a considerable amount of  historical fact, an understanding of which will help in the appreciation  of the poem. During his minority the King was under the tutelage of  Archibald Douglas, sixth Earl of Angus, who had married the King's  mother. The young monarch chafed for a long time under this authority,  but the Douglases were so powerful that he was unable to shake it off,  in spite of several desperate attempts on the part of his sympathizers  to rescue him. In 1528 the King, then sixteen years of age, escaped from  his own castle of Falkland to Stirling Castle. The governor of Stirling,  an enemy of the Douglas family, received him joyfully. There soon  gathered about his standard a sufficient number of powerful peers to  enable him to depose the Earl of Angus from the regency and to banish  him and all his family to England. The Douglas who figures in the poem  is an imaginary uncle of the banished regent, and himself under the ban,  compelled to hide away in the shelter provided for him by Roderick Dhu  on the lonely island in Loch Katrine. He is represented as having been  loved and trusted by King James during the boyhood of the latter, before  the enmity sprang up between the house of Angus and the throne. This  enmity, to quote from the _History of the House of Douglas_, published  at Edinburgh in 1743, \"was so inveterate, that numerous as their allies  were, their nearest friends, even in the most remote parts of Scotland,  durst not entertain them, unless under the strictest and closest  disguise.\"    The outlawed border chieftain, Roderick Dhu, who gives shelter to the  persecuted Douglas, is a fictitious character, but one entirely typical  of the time and place. The expedition undertaken by the young King  against the Border clans, under the guise of a hunting party, is in  part, at least, historic. Pitscottie's History says: \"In 1529 James V  made a convention at Edinburgh for the purpose of considering the best  mode of quelling the Border robbers, who, during the license of his  minority and the troubles which followed, had committed many  exorbitances. Accordingly, he assembled a flying army of ten thousand  men, consisting of his principal nobility and their followers, who were  directed to bring their hawks and dogs with them, that the monarch might  refresh himself with sport during the intervals of military execution.  With this array he swept through Ettrick forest, where he hanged over  the gate of his own castle Piers Cockburn of Henderland, who had  prepared, according to tradition, a feast for his reception.\"      2. GENERAL CRITICISM AND ANALYSIS    _The Lady of the Lake_ appeared in 1810. Two years before, _Marmion_ had  vastly increased the popular enthusiasm aroused by _The Lay of the Last  Minstrel_, and the success of his second long poem had so exhilarated  Scott that, as he says, he \"felt equal to anything and everything.\" To  one of his kinswomen, who urged him not to jeopardize his fame by  another effort in the same kind, he gaily quoted the words of Montrose:      He either fears his fate too much      Or his deserts are small,    Who dares not put it to the touch,      To win or lose it all.    The result justified his confidence; for not only was _The Lady of the  Lake_ as successful as its predecessors, but it remains the most  sterling of Scott's poems. The somewhat cheap supernaturalism of the  _Lay_ appears in it only for a moment; both the story and the characters  are of a less theatrical type than in _Marmion_; and it has a glow,  animation, and onset, which was denied to the later poems, _Rokeby_ and  _The Lord of the Isles_.    The following outline abridged from the excellent one given by Francis  Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_ for August, 1810, will be useful as a  basis for criticism of the matter and style of the poem.         \"The first canto begins with a description of a staghunt in the       Highlands of Perthshire. As the chase lengthens, the sportsmen drop       off; till at last the foremost horseman is left alone; and his       horse, overcome with fatigue, stumbles and dies. The adventurer,       climbing up a craggy eminence, discovers Loch Katrine spread out in       evening glory before him. The huntsman winds his horn; and sees, to       his infinite surprise, a little skiff, guided by a lovely woman,       glide from beneath the trees that overhang the water, and approach       the shore at his feet. Upon the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28297"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, May, 1880 (#6)"],[1,"life, and to develop the fallacious mask of hypocrisy and  deception under which you have acted in your political, as well as moral,  capacity of life.\" So much for the apostate Quaker's character after the  close of the American revolution.    Mr. Lecky, an infidel, says, \"It was reserved for Christianity to present  to the world an ideal character, which through all the changes of eighteen  centuries has filled the hearts of men with an impassioned love, and has  shown itself capable of acting on all ages, nations, temperaments, and  conditions; has not only been the highest pattern of virtue, but the  highest incentive of practice: amid all the sins and failing; amid all the  priestcraft, the persecution and fanaticism which have defaced the church,  it has preserved IN THE CHARACTER OF ITS FOUNDER AN ENDURING PRINCIPLE OF  REGENERATION.\" If such be the fountain let the stream continue to flow.            SHALL WE UNCHAIN THE TIGER? OR, THE FRUITS OF INFIDELITY.                                By Eld. A. I. Maynard.      An infidel production was submitted to Benjamin Franklin manuscript; he  returned it to the author with a letter, from which the following  quotations are extracted: \"I would advise you not to attempt unchaining  the Tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any other  person.... If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be without  it?\" He informs us that he was \"an advocate of infidelity in his early  youth, a confirmed Deist.\" He says his \"arguments perverted some other  young persons, particularly Collins and Ralph, and when he recollected  that they both treated him exceedingly ill without the least remorse, and  also remembered the behavior of Keith, another 'Freethinker,' and his own  conduct toward Vernon and a Miss Reed, which at times gave him great  uneasiness, he was led to suspect that his theory, if true, was not very  useful.\"    Youth and inexperience have been the secret of many young persons being  led astray, like Franklin, by infidel speculations; but age and  observation have convinced many of them that all infidel speculations are  empty and worthless. Look at the history of infidelity in France and  Scotland, and then look at liberalism in America, with Col. Ingersoll  leading the van. Can't you see that its only tendency is to loosen the  restraints of morality and \"unchain the Tiger?\"    The inconsiderate and inexperienced youth of both sexes, have need of all  the motives of religion to lead them from vice, to support their virtue,  and retain them in its practice until it becomes habitual.    Unbeliever, if you read this article, and remember that you have prepared  one sentence to cut one cord that helps to hold the Tiger, _burn it_. Do  not unchain the animal. Would you substitute infidelity for Christianity,  for the religion of the Bible? Would you do that in this country? The  enemies of this religion confess that its code of morals is holy, just and  good, its doctrine is dignified and glorious; its tendency is to purity  and peace; \"it is pure, peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated, full  of mercy and good fruits; without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\"  Montesquieu, the publisher of the Persian letters and president of the  parliament of Bordeaux, says: \"The Christian religion, which ordains that  men should love each other, would, without doubt, have every nation  blessed with the best political and civil laws, because these, next to  religion, are the greatest good that men can have.\"    The Congress of 1776, speaking of religion, declared it was the \"only  solid basis of public liberty and happiness.\" General Washington said it  was \"one of the great pillars of human happiness, and the firmest prop of  the duties of men and citizens.\" What could we gain by exchanging it for  Deism, or Atheism, or Ingersollism? Infidelity proposes to break down the  altars of prayer, take away our Bibles and our days of worship, shut up  the doors against all our Sunday-schools and turn more than a million of  children into the streets, away from sweet song and moralizing influences,  and the pure morals of the gospel of Christ. This would bereave the living  of his rule of life, and rob the dying of the antidote of death.    Shall we \"unchain the Tiger\"--_unbelief_? What would it bring us in return?  Its doctrines are vague speculations, founded on neither data nor  evidence; some of its supporters believe in some kind of a God, while some  deny every God; some few believe in the immortality of the soul, while a  majority, with the French infidels, write over the gates of their  cemeteries, \"Death is eternal sleep.\"    In looking over the various infidel productions I think of the old saying,  \"Be sure you are right, and then go ahead.\" There is no certainty in their  speculations. They do not agree even in their so-called moral code, nor,  as yet, in their doctrinal speculations.    Lord Herbert and the Earl of Shaftesbury thought that the light of nature  would teach all men, without the aid of revelation, to observe the  morality of the Bible. Spinosa and Hobbes, one believing in a God, and the  other an Atheist, agreed that there was nothing that was either right or  wrong in its own nature; and also agreed \"that every man had a right to  obtain, either by force or fraud, everything which either his reason or  his passions prompted him to believe was useful to himself--duties to the  State were his only duties.\"    Blount, another Freethinker, supposed \"that the moral law of nature  justified self-murder.\" Lord Bolingbroke claimed that it enjoined  polygamy; and neither Blount nor Bolingbroke prohibited fornication, or  adultery, or incest, except between parents and children.    But the vagueness and uncertainty of the doctrinal speculations of  infidelity, and the looseness and immorality of its rules of life, are not  the only objections to it. Its tendency, wherever it has been introduced  in the history of our world, has been evil, and _only_ evil. France, at  the commencement of her revolution in 1789, was an infidel nation. The  profligacy of the Catholic priesthood, and the demoralizing example of the  Regent, Duke of Orleans, and the infidel publications of Voltaire and his  associates, had produced a contempt for religion through every rank of  society. The people of France were taught by their literati that the Bible  was at war with their liberties; and that they could never expect to  overturn the throne till they had, first, broken down the \"altar.\" HERE  THE TIGER WAS UNCHAINED!    The lusts and passions of man were set free from the restraints of  Christianity, and the bloody history of that nation, in its devotion to  infidelity, should convince every man that infidelity only \"_unchained the  tiger_\"! It did France no good, _but much evil_. In this state of things  France needed revolution, as America did, and had she engaged in it, with  as pious reliance upon God, \"and with the hearts of her people deeply  imbued with the morality of the Bible, the scion of liberty, carried in  the honored Lafayette from this country,\" would have taken deep root, and  spread forth its branches; and ere this time the fairest portion of Europe  might have reposed under its shadow. But her principles poisoned her  morals, and her immorality disqualified her for freedom. After expending  an incredible amount of treasure, and sacrificing more than two million of  men, she consented to be ruled by a despot in hope of some protection from  her own people, and in hope of some security against the animal which she  had unchained.    With such facts before us, let us Americans decide, not merely as  Christians, but as \"patriots and fathers,\" whether we will cling to the  pure \"Gospel of Jesus Christ,\" given to us in the love of Heaven, and in  the blood of Jesus, rather than accept in its stead the empty, Godless,  Christless, good-for-nothing negative of God and Christ and Christianity.  The chief article in the unbeliever's creed is in these words, \"I believe  in all unbelief.\"                      -------------------------------------    Will not our friends take interest enough in the JOURNAL to increase its  circulation. There is no reason why it should not be immediately doubled,  and thus placed upon a solid basis. It is our intention to make it a  thorough defense of the truth, so much so that all will relish it, and  remember it with delight.            THE STRUGGLE.          \"Passion riots; reason then contends,      And on the conquest every bliss depends.\"      There are two different periods in the history of the race; in the history  of a nation; in the history of the church; in the history of moral  institutions, and in the history of families. In one the intellect  predominates, governs; in the other the emotional nature, or passion,  rules. The fatal day in the history of a nation is the day in which,  through party strife or otherwise, a nation of people becomes a seething  mass of heated passion. Such a nation is like a vessel tossed upon the  waves above the falls of some mighty river, liable to be buried in the  whirlpool of destruction. Men who are governed by their emotional nature  are most liable to disappointments, to troubles, and difficulties of every  kind. Select all the miserable families in your community, tell me where  they are, and I will show you every family in which passion reigns.    Troubles are generally legitimate children of passion. Who has not heard  some one say, repentingly, \"If I had taken a second, sober thought I would  not have done it.\" Intellect belongs to our higher nature, and emotion  belongs to our lower. Intelligence is always at a discount where the  emotional nature governs--it is subordinated to passion. When the intellect  governs, the emotional is subjected to thought; when either one  predominates, the other is brought under and enslaved. These are the two  conflicting elements "]]]
