The loss of Dittmar, however, by no means produced the result upon Sand  that might have been expected, and that he himself seems to indicate in  the regrets he expressed for him. Deprived of that strong soul upon  which he rested, Sand understood that it was his task by redoubled  energy to make the death of Dittmar less fatal to his party. And indeed  he continued singly the work of drawing in recruits which they had been  carrying on together, and the patriotic conspiracy was not for a moment  impeded.    The holidays came, and Sand left Erlangen to return no more. From  Wonsiedel he was to proceed to Jena, in order to complete his  theological studies there. After some days spent with his family, and  indicated in his journal as happy, Sand went to his new place of abode,  where he arrived some time before the festival of the Wartburg. This  festival, established to celebrate the anniversary of the battle of  Leipzig, was regarded as a solemnity throughout Germany, and although  the princes well knew that it was a centre for the annual renewal of  affiliation to the various societies, they dared not forbid it. Indeed,  the manifesto of the Teutonic Association was exhibited at this festival  and signed by more than two thousand deputies from different  universities in Germany. This was a day of joy for Sand; for he found in  the midst of new friends a great number of old ones.    The Government, however, which had not 'dared to attack the Association  by force, resolved to undermine it by opinion. M. de Stauren published a  terrible document, attacking the societies, and founded, it was said,  upon information furnished by Kotzebue. This publication made a great  stir, not only at Jena, but throughout all Germany. Here is the trace of  this event that we find in Sand's journal:--    24th November \"Today, after working with much ease and assiduity, I went  out about four with E. As we crossed the market-place we heard  Kotzebue's new and venomous insult read. By what a fury that man is  possessed against the Burschen and against all who love Germany!\"    Thus far the first time and in these terms Sand's journal presents the  name of the man who, eighteen months later, he was to slay.

As we crossed the market-place we heard Kotzebue's new and  venomous insult read. By what a fury that man is possessed against the  Burschen and against all who love Germany!\"    Thus for the first time and in these terms Sand's journal presents the  name of the man who, eighteen months later, he was to slay.    On the 29th, in the evening, Sand writes again:    \"To-morrow I shall set out courageously and joyfully from this place for  a pilgrimage to Wonsiedel; there I shall find my large-hearted mother  and my tender sister Julia; there I shall cool my head and warm my  heart. Probably I shall be present at my good Fritz's marriage with  Louisa, and at the baptism of my very dear Durchmith's first-born. God,  O my Father, as Thou hast been with me during my sad course, be with me  still on my happy road.\"    This journey did in fact greatly cheer Sand. Since Dittmar's death his  attacks of hypochondria had disappeared. While Dittmar lived he might  die; Dittmar being dead, it was his part to live.    On the 11th of December he left Wonsiedel, to return to Jena, and on the  31st of the same month he wrote this prayer in his journal.    \"O merciful Saviour! I began this year with prayer, and in these last  days I have been subject to distraction and ill-disposed. When I look  backward, I find, alas! that I have not become better; but I have  entered more profoundly into life, and, should occasion present, I now  feel strength to act.    \"It is because Thou hast always been with me, Lord, even when I was not  with Thee.\"    If our readers have followed with some attention the different extracts  from the journal that we have placed before them, they must have seen  Sand's resolution gradually growing stronger and his brain becoming  excited. From the beginning of the year 1818, one feels his view, which  long was timid and wandering, taking in a wider horizon and fixing  itself on a nobler aim. He is no longer ambitious of the pastor's simple  life or of the narrow influence which he might gain in a little  community, and which, in his juvenile modesty, had seemed the height of  good fortune and happiness; it is now his native land, his German  people, nay, all humanity, which he embraces in his gigantic plans of  political regeneration. Thus, on the flyleaf of his journal for the year  1818, he writes:    \"Lord, let me strengthen myself in the idea that I have conceived of the  deliverance of humanity by the holy sacrifice of Thy Son. Grant that I  may be a Christ of Germany, and that, like and through Jesus, I may be  strong and patient in suffering.\"    But the anti-republican pamphlets of Kotzebue increased in number and  gained a fatal influence upon the minds of rulers. Nearly all the  persons who were attacked in these pamphlets were known and esteemed at  Jena; and it may easily be comprehended what effects were produced by  such insults upon these young heads and noble hearts, which carried  conviction to the paint of blindness and enthusiasm to that of  fanaticism.    Thus, here is what Sand wrote in his diary on the 5th of May.    \"Lord, what causes this melancholy anguish which has again taken  possession of me? But a firm and constant will surmounts everything, and  the idea of the country gives joy and courage to the saddest and the  weakest. When I think of that, I am always amazed that there is none  among us found courageous enough to drive a knife into the breast of  Kotzebue or of any other traitor.\"    Still dominated by the same thought, he continues thus on the 18th of  May:--    \"A man is nothing in comparison with a nation; he is a unity compared  with millions, a minute compared with a century. A man, whom nothing  precedes and nothing follows, is born, lives, and dies in a longer or  shorter time, which, relatively to eternity, hardly equals the duration  of a lightning flash. A nation, on the contrary, is immortal.\"    From time to time, however, amid these thoughts that bear the impress of  that political fatality which was driving him towards the deed of  bloodshed, the kindly and joyous youth reappears. On the 24th of June he  writes to his mother:--    \"I have received your long and beautiful letter, accompanied by the very  complete and well-chosen outfit which you send me. The sight of this  fine linen gave me back one of the joys of my childhood. These are fresh  benefits. My prayers never remain unfulfilled, and I have continual  cause to thank you and God. I receive, all at once, shirts, two pairs of  fine sheets, a present of your work, and of Julia's and Caroline's work,  dainties and sweetmeats, so that I am still jumping with joy and I  turned three times on my heels when I opened the little parcel. Receive  the thanks of my heart, and share, as giver, in the joy of him who has  received.    \"Today, however, is a very serious day, the last day of spring and the  anniversary of that on which I lost my noble and good Dittmar. I am a  prey to a thousand different and confused feelings; but I have only two  passions left in me which remain upright and like two pillars of brass  support this whole chaos--the thought of God and the love of my  country.\"    During all this time Sand's life remains apparently calm and equal; the  inward storm is calmed; he rejoices in his application to work and his  cheerful temper. However, from time to time, he makes great complaints  to himself of his propensity to love dainty food, which he does not  always find it possible to conquer. Then, in his self-contempt, he calls  himself \"fig-stomach\" or \"cake-stomach.\" But amid all this the religious  and political exaltation and visits all the battlefields near to the  road that he follows. On the 18th of October he is back at Jena, where  he resumes his studies with more application than ever. It is among such  university studies that the year 1818 closes far him, and we should  hardly suspect the terrible resolution which he has taken, were it not  that we find in his journal this last note, dated the 31st of December:    \"I finish the last day of this year 1818, then, in a serious and solemn  mood, and I have decided that the Christmas feast which has just gone by  will be the last Christmas feast that I shall celebrate. If anything is  to come of our efforts, if the cause of humanity is to assume the upper  hand in our country, if in this faithless epoch any noble feelings can  spring up afresh and make way, it can only happen if the wretch, the  traitor, the seducer of youth, the infamous Kotzebue, falls! I am fully  convinced of this, and until I have accomplished the work upon which I  have resolved, I shall have no rest. Lord, Thou who knowest that I have  devoted my life to this great action, I only need, now that it is fixed  in my mind, to beg of Thee true firmness and courage of soul.\"    Here Sand's diary ends; he had begun it to strengthen himself; he had  reached his aim; he needed nothing more. From this moment he was  occupied by nothing but this single idea, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#6)"],[1," fact that there was much in what they had just seen to recall the  case of Gaufredi, who had been put to death a few years before in  consequence of a decree of the Parliament of Aix, in Provence. This  ill-judged remark of Mignon showed so clearly what his aim was that the  magistrates made no reply. The civil lieutenant remarked that he had  been surprised that Mignon had not made any attempt to find out the  cause of the enmity of which the superior had spoken, and which it was  so important to find out; but Mignon excused himself by saying that he  had no right to put questions merely to gratify curiosity. The civil  lieutenant was about to insist on the matter being investigated, when  the lay sister in her turn went into a fit, thus extricating Mignon from  his embarrassment. The magistrates approached the lay sister's bed at  once, and directed Mignon to put the same questions to her as to the  superior: he did so, but all in vain; all she would reply was, \"To the  other! To the other!\"    Mignon explained this refusal to answer by saying that the evil spirit  which was in her was of an inferior order, and referred all questioners  to Ashtaroth, who was his superior. As this was the only explanation,  good or bad, offered them by Mignon, the magistrates went away, and drew  up a report of all they had seen and heard without comment, merely  appending their signatures.    But in the town very few people showed the same discretion and reticence  as the magistrates. The bigoted believed, the hypocrites pretended to  believe; and the worldly-minded, who were numerous, discussed the  doctrine of possession in all its phases, and made no secret of their  own entire incredulity. They wondered, and not without reason it must be  confessed, what had induced the devils to go out of the nuns' bodies for  two days only, and then come back and resume possession, to the  confusion of the exorcists; further, they wanted to know why the mother  superior's devil spoke Latin, while the lay sister's was ignorant of  that tongue; for a mere difference of rank in the hierarchy of hell did  not seem a sufficient explanation of such a difference in education;  Mignon's refusal to go on with his interrogations as to the cause of the  enmity made them, they said, suspect that, knowing he had reached the  end of Ashtaroth's classical knowledge, he felt it useless to try to  continue the dialogue in the Ciceronian idiom. Moreover, it was well  known that only a few days before all Urbain's worst enemies had met in  conclave in the village of Puidardane; and besides, how stupidly Mignon  had shown his hand by mentioning Gaufredi, the priest who had been  executed at Aix: lastly, why had not a desire for impartiality been  shown by calling in other than Carmelite monks to be present at the  exorcism, that order having a private quarrel with Grandier? It must be  admitted that this way of looking at the case was not wanting in  shrewdness.    On the following day, October 12th, the bailiff and the civil  lieutenant, having heard that exorcisms had been again tried without  their having been informed beforehand, requested a certain Canon  Rousseau to accompany them, and set out with him and their clerk for the  convent. On arriving, they asked for Mignon, and on his appearance they  told him that this matter of exorcism was of such importance that no  further steps were to be taken in it without the authorities being  present, and that in future they were to be given timely notice of every  attempt to get rid of the evil spirits. They added that this was all the  more necessary as Mignon's position as director of the sisterhood and  his well-known hate for Grandier would draw suspicions on him unworthy  of his cloth, suspicions which he ought to be the first to wish to see  dissipated, and that quickly; and that, therefore, the work which he had  so piously begun would be completed by exorcists appointed by the court.    Mignon replied that, though he had not the slightest objection to the  magistrates being present at all the exorcisms, yet he could not promise  that the spirits would reply to anyone except himself and Barre. Just at  that moment Barre came on the scene, paler and more gloomy than ever,  and speaking with the air of a man whose word no one could help  believing, he announced that before their arrival some most  extraordinary things had taken place. The magistrates asked what things,  and Barre replied that he had learned from the mother superior that she  was possessed, not by one, but by seven devils, of whom Ashtaroth was  the chief; that Grandier had entrusted his pact with the devil, under  the symbol of a bunch of roses, to a certain Jean Pivart, to give to a  girl who had introduced it into the convent garden by throwing it over  the wall; that this took place in the night between Saturday and Sunday  \"hora secunda nocturna\" (two hours after midnight); that those were the  very words the superior had used, but that while she readily named  Pivart, she absolutely refused to give the name of the girl; that on  asking what Pivart was; she had replied, \"Pauper magus\" (a poor  magician); that he then had pressed her as to the word magus, and that  she had replied \"Magicianus et civis\" (magician and citizen); and that  just as she said those words the magistrates had arrived, and he had  asked no more questions.    The two officials listened to this information with the seriousness  befitting men entrusted with high judicial functions, and announced to  the two priests that they proposed to visit the possessed women and  witness for themselves the miracles that were taking place. The clerics  offered no opposition, but said they feared that the devils were  fatigued and would refuse to reply; and, in fact, when the officials  reached the sickroom the two patients appeared to have regained some  degree of calm. Mignon took advantage of this quiet moment to say mass,  to which the two magistrates listened devoutly and tranquilly, and while  the sacrifice was being offered the demons did not dare to move. It was  expected that they would offer some opposition at the elevation of the  Host, but everything passed off without disturbance, only the lay  sister's hands and feet twitched a great deal; and this was the only  fact which the magistrates thought worthy of mention in their report for  that morning. Barre assured them, however, that if they would return  about three o'clock the devils would probably have recovered  sufficiently from their fatigue to give a second performance.    As the two gentlemen had determined to see the affair to the end, they  returned to the convent at the hour named, accompanied by Messire Irenee  de Sainte-Marthe, sieur Deshurneaux; and found the room in which the  possessed were lying full of curious spectators; for the exorcists had  been true prophets--the devils were at work again.    The superior, as always, was the more tormented of the two, as was only  to be expected, she having seven devils in her all at once; she was  terribly convulsed, and was writhing and foaming at the mouth as if she  were mad. No one could long continue in such a condition without serious  injury to health; Barre therefore asked the devil-in-chief how soon he  would come out. \"Cras mane\" (To-morrow morning), he replied. The  exorcist then tried to hurry him, asking him why he would not come out  at once; whereupon the superior murmured the word \"Pactum\" (A pact); and  then \"Sacerdos\" (A priest), and finally \"Finis,\" or \"Finit,\" for even  those nearest could not catch the word distinctly, as the devil, afraid  doubtless of perpetrating a barbarism, spoke through the nun's closely  clenched teeth. This being all decidedly unsatisfying, the magistrates  insisted that the examination should continue, but the devils had again  exhausted themselves, and refused to utter another word. The priest even  tried touching the superior's head with the pyx, while prayers and  litanies were recited, but it was all in vain, except that some of the  spectators thought that the contortions of the patient became more  violent when the intercessions of certain saints were invoked, as for  instance Saints Augustine Jerome, Antony, and Mary Magdalene. Barre next  directed the mother superior to dedicate her heart and soul to God,  which she did without difficulty; but when he commanded her to dedicate  her body also, the chief devil indicated by fresh convulsions that he  was not going to allow himself to be deprived of a domicile without  resistance, and made those who had heard him say that he would leave the  next morning feel that he had only said so under compulsion; and their  curiosity as to the result became heightened. At length, however,  despite the obstinate resistance of the demon, the superior succeeded in  dedicating her body also to God, and thus victorious her features  resumed their usual expression, and smiling as if nothing had happened,  she turned to Barre and said that there was no vestige of Satan left in  her. The civil lieutenant then asked her if she remembered the questions  she had been asked and the answers she had given, but she replied that  she remembered nothing; but afterwards, having taken some refreshment,  she said to those around her that she recollected perfectly how the  first possession, over which Mignon had triumphed, had taken place: one  evening about ten o'clock, while several nuns were still in her room,  although she was already in bed, it seemed to her that someone took her  hand and laid something in it, closing her fingers; at that instant she  felt a sharp pain as if she had been pricked by three pins, and hearing  her scream, the nuns came to her bedside to ask what ailed her. She held  out her hand, and they found three black thorns sticking in it, each  having made a tiny wound. Just as she had told this tale, the lay  sister, as if to prevent all commentary, was seized"]]]
