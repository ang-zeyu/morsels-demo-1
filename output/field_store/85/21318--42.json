In the meantime, Comrade Jackson, I would  call your attention to the fact that we seem to have lost our way.  In the exhilaration of this little chat, our footsteps have  wandered. Where we are, goodness only knows. I can only say that I  shouldn't care to have to live here.\"    \"There's a name up on the other side of that lamp-post.\"    \"Let us wend in that direction. Ah, Pleasant Street? I fancy that  the master-mind who chose that name must have had the rudiments of  a sense of humour.\"    It was indeed a repellent neighbourhood in which they had arrived.  The New York slum stands in a class of its own. It is unique. The  height of the houses and the narrowness of the streets seem to  condense its unpleasantness. All the smells and noises, which are  many and varied, are penned up in a sort of canyon, and gain in  vehemence from the fact. The masses of dirty clothes hanging from  the fire-escapes increase the depression. Nowhere in the city does  one realise so fully the disadvantages of a lack of space. New  York, being an island, has had no room to spread. It is a town of  human sardines. In the poorer quarters the congestion is  unbelievable.    Psmith and Mike picked their way through the groups of ragged  children who covered the roadway. There seemed to be thousands of  them.    \"Poor kids!\" said Mike. \"It must be awful living in a hole like  this.\"    Psmith said nothing. He was looking thoughtful. He glanced up at  the grimy buildings on each side. On the lower floors one could  see into dark, bare rooms. These were the star apartments of the  tenement-houses, for they opened on to the street, and so got a  little light and air. The imagination jibbed at the thought of the  back rooms.    \"I wonder who owns these places,\" said Psmith. \"It seems to me  that there's what you might call room for improvement. It wouldn't  be a scaly idea to turn that _Cosy Moments_ search-light we were  talking about on to them.\"    They walked on a few steps.    \"Look here,\" said Psmith, stopping. \"This place makes me sick. I'm  going in to have a look round. I expect some muscular householder  will resent the intrusion and boot us out, but we'll risk it.\"    Followed by Mike, he turned in at one of the doors. A group of men  leaning against the opposite wall looked at them without curiosity.  Probably they took them for reporters hunting for a story.  Reporters were the only tolerably well-dressed visitors Pleasant  Street ever entertained.    It was almost pitch dark on the stairs. They had to feel their way  up. Most of the doors were shut but one on the second floor was  ajar. Through the opening they had a glimpse of a number of women  sitting round on boxes. The floor was covered with little heaps of  linen. All the women were sewing. Mike, stumbling in the darkness,  almost fell against the door. None of the women looked up at the  noise. Time was evidently money in Pleasant Street.    On the fourth floor there was an open door. The room was empty. It  was a good representative Pleasant Street back room. The architect  in this case had given rein to a passion for originality. He had  constructed the room without a window of any sort whatsoever. There  was a square opening in the door. Through this, it was to be  presumed, the entire stock of air used by the occupants was  supposed to come.    They stumbled downstairs again and out into the street. By contrast  with the conditions indoors the street seemed spacious and breezy.    \"This,\" said Psmith, as they walked on, \"is where _Cosy Moments_ gets  busy at a singularly early date.\"    \"What are you going to do?\" asked Mike.    \"I propose, Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, \"if Comrade Windsor is  agreeable, to make things as warm for the owner of this place as  I jolly well know how. What he wants, of course,\" he proceeded  in the tone of a family doctor prescribing for a patient, \"is  disembowelling. I fancy, however, that a mawkishly sentimental  legislature will prevent our performing that national service. We  must endeavour to do what we can by means of kindly criticism in  the paper. And now, having settled that important point, let us  try and get out of this place of wrath, and find Fourth Avenue.\"        CHAPTER VII    VISITORS AT THE OFFICE    On the following morning Mike had to leave with the team for  Philadelphia. Psmith came down to the ferry to see him off, and  hung about moodily until the time of departure.    \"It is saddening me to a great extent, Comrade Jackson,\" he said,  \"this perpetual parting of the ways. When I think of the happy  moments we have spent hand-in-hand across the seas, it fills me  with a certain melancholy to have you flitting off in this manner  without me. Yet there is another side to the picture. To me there  is something singularly impressive in our unhesitating reply to the  calls of Duty. Your Duty summons you to Philadelphia, to knock the  cover off the local bowling. Mine retains me here, to play my part  in the great work of making New York sit up. By the time you  return, with a century or two, I trust, in your bag, the good work  should, I fancy, be getting something of a move on. I will complete  the arrangements with regard to the flat.\"    After leaving Pleasant Street they had found Fourth Avenue by a  devious route, and had opened negotiations for a large flat near  Thirtieth Street. It was immediately above a saloon, which was  something of a drawback, but the landlord had assured them that the  voices of the revellers did not penetrate to it.                *    *    *    When the ferry-boat had borne Mike off across the river, Psmith  turned to stroll to the office of _Cosy Moments_. The day was fine,  and on the whole, despite Mike's desertion, he felt pleased with  life. Psmith's was a nature which required a certain amount of  stimulus in the way of gentle excitement; and it seemed to him that  the conduct of the remodelled _Cosy Moments_ might supply this. He  liked Billy Windsor, and looked forward to a not unenjoyable time  till Mike should return.    The offices of _Cosy Moments_ were in a large building in the street  off Madison Avenue. They consisted of a sort of outer lair, where  Pugsy Maloney spent his time reading tales of life in the prairies  and heading off undesirable visitors; a small room, which would  have belonged to the stenographer if _Cosy Moments_ had possessed  one; and a larger room beyond, which was the editorial sanctum.    As Psmith passed through the front door, Pugsy Maloney rose.    \"Say!\" said Master Maloney.    \"Say on, Comrade Maloney,\" said Psmith.    \"Dey're in dere.\"    \"Who, precisely?\"    \"A whole bunch of dem.\"    Psmith inspected Master Maloney through his eye-glass. \"Can  you give me any particulars?\" he asked patiently. \"You are  well-meaning, but vague, Comrade Maloney. Who are in there?\"    \"De whole bunch of dem. Dere's Mr. Asher and the Rev. Philpotts and  a gazebo what calls himself Waterman and about 'steen more of dem.\"    A faint smile appeared upon Psmith's face.    \"And is Comrade Windsor in there, too, in the middle of them?\"    \"Nope. Mr. Windsor's out to lunch.\"    \"Comrade Windsor knows his business. Why did you let them in?\"    \"Sure, dey just butted in,\" said Master Maloney complainingly. \"I  was sittin' here, readin' me book, when de foist of de guys blew  in. 'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll go in  an' wait,' says he. 'Nuttin' doin',' says I. 'Nix on de goin' in  act.' I might as well have saved me breat'. In he butts, and he's  in der now. Well, in about t'ree minutes along comes another  gazebo. 'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll  wait,' says he lightin' out for de door. Wit dat I sees de  proposition's too fierce for muh. I can't keep dese big husky guys  out if dey's for buttin' in. So when de rest of de bunch comes  along, I don't try to give dem de t'run down. I says, 'Well,  gents,' I says, 'it's up to youse. De editor ain't in, but if youse  wants to join de giddy t'rong, push t'roo inter de inner room. I  can't be boddered.'\"    \"And what more _could_ you have said?\" agreed Psmith approvingly.  \"Tell me, Comrade Maloney, what was the general average aspect of  these determined spirits?\"    \"Huh?\"    \"Did they seem to you to be gay, lighthearted? Did they carol  snatches of song as they went? Or did they appear to be looking  for some one with a hatchet?\"    \"Dey was hoppin'-mad, de whole bunch of dem.\"    \"As I suspected. But we must not repine, Comrade Maloney. These  trifling contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high  journalistic aims. I will interview these merchants. I fancy that  with the aid of the Diplomatic Smile and the Honeyed Word I may  manage to pull through. It is as well, perhaps, that Comrade  Windsor is out. The situation calls for the handling of a man of  delicate culture and nice tact. Comrade Windsor would probably have  endeavoured to clear the room with a chair. If he should arrive  during the seance, Comrade Maloney, be so good as to inform him of  the state of affairs, and tell him not to come in. Give him my  compliments, and tell him to go out and watch the snowdrops growing  in Madison Square Garden.\"    \"Sure,\" said Master Maloney.    Then Psmith, having smoothed the nap of his hat and flicked a speck  of dust from his coat-sleeve, walked to the door of the inner room  and went in.        CHAPTER VIII    THE HONEYED WORD    Master Maloney's statement that \"about 'steen visitors\" had arrived  in addition to Messrs. Asher, Waterman, and the Rev. Philpotts  proved to have been due to a great extent to a somewhat feverish  imagination. There were only five men in the room.    As Psmith entered, every eye was turned upon him.

The two specimens that I have examined show no sign of  approach toward _castanogastris_. More specimens of Scaled Quail from  Coahuila are needed to permit accurate definition of the distribution  of the subspecies.    *_Cyrtonyx montezumae mearnsi_ Nelson.--The Harlequin Quail is locally  common in Coahuila; _C. m. mearnsi_ is present in northwestern Coahuila  (Aldrich and Duvall, 1955:20). Miller (1955a:162) stated that an area  in the head of Corte Madera Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen at 7500  feet was the principal location for _C. m. mearnsi_. He further  suggested that the Harlequin Quail breeds in the Sierra del Carmen and  remarked that Marsh took a male on September 7 at Jardin del Sur. He  added that the occurrence of _C. m. montezumae_ in northern Coahuila as  reported by Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:79) is \"possibly an  error or was based on individual dark variants....\" Baker noted the  Harlequin Quail (unidentified to subspecies) 9 mi. W and 1 mi. S Villa  Acuna, 1120 feet, on April 4, 1950.    *_Cyrtonyx montezumae montezumae_ (Vigors).--This subspecies of the  Harlequin Quail has been recorded from southeastern Coahuila. Ridgway  and Friedmann (1946:396) listed _C. m. montezumae_ from Saltillo. Baker  saw a pair of Harlequin Quail (unidentified to subspecies) at San  Antonio de las Alazanas on March 25, 1950. More collecting is necessary  for an understanding of the distribution and intergradation of these  subspecies in Coahuila.    *_Meleagris gallopavo intermedia_ Sennett.--_Specimens examined:_ total  4: [Female] 31022 from Fortin (=33 mi. N, 8 mi. W San Geronimo), 3300  ft., March 28, 1952, weight, 9 lbs.; [Female] 29420 from 3 mi. W, 1 mi.  S San Geronimo, April 9, 1950, weight, 7 lbs.; and [Male] 29421 and  [Female] 29422 from 3 mi. W, 2 mi. S San Geronimo, April 9, 1950,  weights, 11.5 and 8.5 lbs.    The Turkey in Coahuila is restricted to the northern section of the  State. Miller (1955a:162) remarked that the population of Turkeys in  the Sierra del Carmen was sparse and did not range above 7500 feet into  the highest pine-oak and Douglas fir areas. Baker saw Turkeys 4 mi. W  Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 feet, on March 23, 1952. William Schaldach,  Jr., noted 30 Turkeys \"just west of Rancho San Geronimo\" on April 9,  1950. Aldrich and Duvall (1955:22) indicated several localities in  northern Coahuila where the Turkey occurs or occurred.    _Grus canadensis_ (Linnaeus).--Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:28) remarked  that a flock of Sandhill Cranes was heard \"near Mayran ... on January  30.\"    _Porzana carolina_ (Linnaeus).--The Sora is an uncommon spring and fall  migrant in Coahuila. Amadon and Phillips (1947:577) obtained an adult  male Sora at Las Delicias on August 15.    _Fulica americana_ Gmelin.--The American Coot probably occurs in the  State as a spring and fall migrant. Dickerman saw two coots 8 mi. E and  2 mi. S Americanos on May 18, 1954.    *_Charadrius vociferus vociferus_ Linnaeus.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31023, from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co.,  Texas, in Coahuila), 600 ft., March 19, 1952, weight, 82.7 gms.    In Coahuila the Killdeer seems to be uncommon. Van Tyne and Sutton  (1937:28) remarked that it nested in Brewster County, Texas. The  species probably nests in northern Coahuila as well; the lengths of the  testes (left, 9 mm.; right, 4 mm.) of No. 31023 support this view.    _Eupoda montana_ (Townsend).--Pitelka (1948:118) recorded one female  Mountain Plover from Hipolito on February 23. Van Tyne and Sutton  (1937:28) reported that the Mountain Plover nested in Brewster County,  Texas. Possibly _Eupoda montana_ nests in northern Coahuila as well.    _Numenius americanus parvus_ Bishop.--_Specimens examined:_ total 3:  [Male] 31434 and [Female] 35406 (skeleton only) from 8 mi. E, 2 mi. S  Americanos, May 19, 1954, measurements: wing, 250, 258 mm.; tail, 96,  100 mm.; tarsus, 74, 81.5 mm.; culmen, 11.2, 16.5 mm.; [Male] gonad,  6x2 mm.; and [Female] 35400 (skeleton only) from 7 mi. W San Antonio de  las Alazanas, January 11, 1954.    The Long-billed Curlew is not common in Coahuila. Dickerman obtained  both the specimens from 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos out of a flock  of 35. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:28) noted the Long-billed Curlew  \"near San Pedro ... [on] January 29.\"    _Actitis macularia_ (Linnaeus).--The Spotted Sandpiper has been  obtained from two localities in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:162) stated  that an immature in fall migration was taken \"at the tank in the  western hills\" of the Sierra del Carmen on September 4. Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:189) found the Spotted Sandpiper \"at the Chorro del Agua  near Arteaga\" on April 17 and 19.    _Totanus melanoleucus_ (Gmelin).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Female]  31024, from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co., Texas, in  Coahuila), 600 ft., March 18, 1952, weight, 224 gms.    The Greater Yellowlegs is an uncommon spring and probably fall migrant  in Coahuila. No. 31024 is the first record of this species in Coahuila.    _Totanus flavipes_ (Gmelin).--Miller (1955a:162) reported that Marsh  took a Lesser Yellowlegs \"at the tank in the western hills\" of the  Sierra del Carmen on September 4.    _Erolia melanotos_ (Vieillot).--Miller (1955a:162) reported taking a  Pectoral Sandpiper on September 4 \"at the tank in the western hills\" of  the Sierra del Carmen.    [_Erolia minutilla_ (Vieillot).--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1950:99) listed the Least Sandpiper from Coahuila.]    *_Recurvirostra americana_ Gmelin.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Male] 31433 and [Female] 31432 from 8 mi. E, 2 mi. S Americanos, May  19, 1954.    Van Hoose (1955:302) reported a small breeding colony of American  Avocets 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos \"on a large grassy playa  traversed by rows of creosote (_Larrea tridentata_).\" No. 31432 was  taken from a nest containing four partly-incubated eggs. Van Hoose  (_loc. cit._) also reported that four eggs in a second nest contained  well-developed, downy young.    _Steganopus tricolor_ Vieillot.--Wilson's Phalarope occurs in Coahuila  as a spring and probably fall migrant. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:31)  saw the species several times along the Rio Grande. Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1950:102) listed _Steganopus tricolor_ from the Rio Grande  along the borders of Chihuahua and Coahuila on May 10-16.    [_Larus argentatus smithsonianus_ Coues.--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1950:104) listed this subspecies of the Herring Gull from the State.]    [_Larus delawarensis_ Ord.--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:103)  stated that the Ring-billed Gull occurs in Coahuila.]    *_Columba fasciata fasciata_ Say.--_Specimens examined:_ total 3:  [Male] 35401 (skeleton only) from 22 mi. S and 5 mi. W Ocampo, 7000  ft., April 6, 1954; and [Male] 32035 and [Female] 32036 from 4 mi. N,  21 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas, 6200 ft., July 2, 1952.    The Band-tailed Pigeon is locally common in Coahuila. Miller  (1955a:162) remarked that the Band-tailed Pigeon \"was unaccountably  rare in 1953\" in the Sierra del Carmen, and said that a specimen was  taken on August 7 in Vivoras Canyon. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:189)  wrote that \"small flocks were seen each day ... on the summit of  Diamante Pass, but only on one occasion was a pair noted.\" Dickerman  saw 10 Band-tailed Pigeons 20 mi. S Ocampo, 6000 feet, on April 4,  1954. The enlarged testes (17 mm.) of No. 32035, and an egg (38 mm.  long) in No. 32036 show that the species breeds in central Coahuila.    *_Zenaida asiatica asiatica_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31025 (skeleton only), from 10 mi. S and 5 mi. E Boquillas,  1500 ft., March 4, 1952.    Miller (1955a:163) took a male White-winged Dove on April 23 \"at the  mouth of Boquillas Canyon at about 4900 feet\" and remarked that this  bird might either be a straggler or a representative of a normal  breeding population (_Z. a. asiatica_). On January 29 and 30, Sutton  and Burleigh (1939a:29) saw White-winged Doves several times in  southern Coahuila along the highway from Saltillo to San Pedro.    **_Zenaida asiatica mearnsi_ (Ridgway).--Amadon and Phillips (1947:577)  obtained an adult White-winged Dove of this subspecies at Delicias on  August 14.    _Zenaidura macroura carolinensis_ (Linnaeus).--Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1950:117) listed this subspecies of the Mourning Dove as a  spring and fall migrant on the \"Central Plateau\" (Coahuila is part of  the \"Central Plateau,\"), \"as proven by banding records not indicated in  literature.\"    *_Zenaidura macroura marginella_ (Woodhouse).--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Female] 34455, from 1 mi. W Jaco, June 27, 1953.    Miller (1955a:163) reported _Z. m. marginella_ as occurring commonly in  the desert border and lower canyons at the base of the mountains of the  Sierra del Carmen, \"but it occasionally ranged up to 6000 feet in  openings in the pine-oak belt.\" Burleigh and Lowery (1942:189) remarked  that this dove was fairly plentiful in the open desert country \"about  Saltillo, and was ... noted in small numbers in Diamante Valley on  April 17 and 19;\" they also said that the Mourning Dove was not seen  above an elevation of about 7500 feet. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:29)  observed Mourning Doves along the highway across southern Coahuila.  Mourning Doves were seen by Findley 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 feet, on June  19, 1952, and 2 mi. S and 11 mi. E Nava, 810 feet, on June 15, 1952.  Dickerman saw one in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954. Findley saw  more than one 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952,  as did Dickerman at San Marcos (=20 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas) on May 4,  1954.    **_Columb"]]]
