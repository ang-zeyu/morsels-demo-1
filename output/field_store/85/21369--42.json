In the year 600 St. Gregory improved upon these chants, inventing the  scale of eight notes. His system is the basis of our modern music.    From the close of the eleventh to the commencement of the fourteenth  century, minstrels, _jongleurs_, or troubadours, were the principal  devotees of music. They seem to have been its custodians, so to speak;  and to their guild many of the knights belonged. Some of the kings and  nobles of the time were also, in a sense, troubadours; such as, for  instance, Thibault of Navarre, and William the Ninth of Poitou.    These roving musicians, who generally united the qualities of the  poet, the musical composer, and performer, were treated with much  favor by princes and all the nobility, and were everywhere warmly  welcomed for a long period. It is, however, far from pleasant to have  to say that this for a long time noble class of musicians, to whom we  owe so much for the preservation unbroken for three hundred years of  the chain of musical life, as well indeed, also, as that of general  literature, spoiled perhaps by the excessive praises and indulgences  accorded them, became at last quite dissolute, and fell from their  high position. All royal favors were finally withdrawn from them, and  orders for their restriction were issued from the throne.    Mr. B.W. Ball (in that faithful exponent of art, \"The Boston  Commonwealth\") thus expressively sings the story of the ancient  troubadour, styling him--         \"THE POET OF OLD.\"         Once the poet wandered,         With his lyre in hand,--       Wandered, singing, harping,         On from land to land.         Like a bird he hovered;         And, where'er he came,       Kindled he each bosom         With his song to flame.         Careless of the morrow,         Journeyed he along;       Opened every portal         To the sound of song.         _Sua sponte_ heart's-ease         In his bosom grew:       Happiness as birthright,         Like the gods, he knew.         All life's haps and changes         On his chords he rung:       Every thought, emotion,         In him found a tongue.         Voiced he for the lover         Passion of his breast;       Feigned he, death to lighten,         Islands of the Blest.         Up in ether throned he         Gods, the world to sway,--       Gods to bend and listen         While their votaries pray.         Soul and sense, enchanted,         Drank his accents in:       E'en to marble bosoms         He his way could win.         From her casement Beauty         Leaned his song to hear:       E'en the haughty conqueror         Bent a willing ear;         For without the poet         And his epic lay       Passed his vast existence,         Whirlwind-like, away,--         Trace nor vestige leaving         Where his legions trod,       Which the year effaced not         From the vernal sod.         Thus the poet wandered         In a nobler time,--       Wandered, singing, harping,         Free of every clime.    During the fourteenth century, music was most cultivated by the people  of the Netherlands, who carried the art towards much perfection,  producing several fine composers, and furnishing the leading musical  instructors for the other parts of Europe. Among some of the ablest  musicians of the Netherlands may be mentioned Dufay, Jan of Okenheim,  and Josquin Despres, the latter being the most celebrated of  contrapuntists. The Netherland musical supremacy lasted until 1563.    In the year 1400 the claims of music received the recognition of the  crown in England, a charter being granted to a regularly formed  musical society.    Commencing with the invention of movable type in 1502 (which invention  so vastly facilitated the publication and spreading of the thoughts of  the composer), and with the Reformation in the sixteenth century, the  noble art of music began a new, unimpeded, and brilliant career among  the civilized nations of the world. Dating from thence, the steps in  the progress of this delightful science can be plainly traced. Unvexed  and unfettered by the obscurities that attach to its antique history,  we can contemplate with pleasure and profit the wonderful creations  and achievements of its devotees.    This I need not attempt here, save in the briefest form; my purpose in  preparing this chapter being only to give, as indicated in the title,  a glance at the history of music.    To Palestrina, a learned Italian of the sixteenth century, and whose  musical genius and industry were most remarkable, is due the greatest  homage and gratitude of a music-loving world. Of him an eminent  musical writer says, \"It is difficult to over-estimate his talent and  influence over the art of music in his day. He was regarded as the  great reformer of church music. His knowledge of counterpoint, and the  elevation and nobility of his style, made his masses and other  compositions, of which he wrote a great number, examples for all time  of what music should be.\"    In this century lived many notable composers, nearly all of whom  distinguished themselves in the production of madrigal music. To the  latter the English people were much devoted. Reading at sight was at  that day, even more than now, a common accomplishment among the  educated. The English queen Elizabeth was quite fond of music, and was  somewhat accomplished in the art, performing upon the lute, virginals,  and viol. She often charmed the _attaches_ of and visitors to her  court by her skilful performances. During her reign, and by her  encouragement, the cultivation of this noble art received a new and  strong impulse in England, and several composers and performers of  high merit lived.    In the year 1540 oratorio was first composed, followed by opera in  1594. During this period, instrumental music began to be used in the  churches; and the violin was brought by the celebrated Amati family to  a beauty of form, and sweetness of tone, not since excelled.    During the seventeenth century such great composers as Stradella,  Scarlatti, Caldara, and Claudio lived; and the different forms of  opera were developed in England, France, and Italy.    During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the art of music, in  its new, rich, and deep developments, as shown in the masterly,  wonderful creations of several of the great composers of those  periods, and in the scientific performances of many fine  instrumentalists, attained a height of surpassing grandeur. Many men  of brilliant musical genius and of remarkable industry and  perseverance were born; and, with new conceptions of the scope and  capabilities of the divine art, they penetrated its innermost depths,  and brought to the ears of the music-loving world new and enrapturing  forms of harmony. Among these great masters, leaving out those already  mentioned, were Handel, Henry Purcell, Bach, Gluck, Haydn, Mozart,  Beethoven, and Spontini.    But, before proceeding farther, the writer considers it proper to  remark, that to give a extended description of the progress of music  during the three last centuries, mentioning in detail the many  creations and achievements of those who have become great, nay, in  some instances he might say almost immortal, in its sacred domain,  would require a volume far beyond the pretensions and intended limits  of this one.    Besides, the author confesses that he pauses with feelings of  reverence while contemplating the mighty genius and divinely  approximating achievements of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Spohr, and  Mendelssohn, fearing that his unskilful pen might fail in an attempt  at description. Nor does he feel much less embarrassed when he  contemplates the accomplishments of those wonderful interpreters of  the works of the noble masters, who have, either through the  enchanting modulations of their voices or with skilful touch upon  instruments, evolved their magic strains. Let an abler pen than mine  portray the sublime triumphs of Hasse, Mario, Wachtel, Santley,  Whitney; of Albani, Malibran, Lind, Parepa Rosa, Nilsson; of Haupt,  Paganini, Vieuxtemps, Ole Bull, Rubinstein, Liszt, and Von Bulow.[4]    [Footnote 4: For an able criticism of the composers and some of the  performers mentioned, the reader is referred to Professor Ritter's  very valuable History of Music, in two volumes.]    The eighteenth century was a most remarkable period for achievements  in the composition of orchestral, oratorio, and operatic music,--the  same being finely interpreted by vocal and instrumental artists of  most wonderful skill.    In referring to some among that galaxy of bright stars, I use, in  regard to Mozart, the clear and beautiful language of another:[5] \"The  great musical composer Mozart was a wonderful instance of precocity,  as well as of surpassing genius. He died at the early age of  thirty-five, after a career of unrivalled splendor, and the  production of a succession of works which have left him almost, if not  entirely, without an equal among either his predecessors or those who  have come after him. Mozart's devotion to his art, and the  indefatigable industry with which, notwithstanding his extraordinary  powers, he gave himself to its cultivation, may read an instructive  lesson, even to far inferior minds, in illustration of the true and  only method for the attainment of excellence. From his childhood to  the last moment of his life, Mozart was wholly a musician. Even in his  earliest years, no pastime had any interest for him in which music was  not introduced. His voluminous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#6)"],[1,"was the  last of the kings to hunt from Farnham. George III and Queen Charlotte  visited the castle because Bishop Thomas had been the King's tutor, but  Farnham's entertaining of royalty was nearly at an end. Once, in the  last century, Queen Victoria rode there from Aldershot with the Prince  Consort, inspected the Bible on which she had taken her oath at the  Coronation, admired the castle, and rode back again.    [Illustration: _Farnham Castle from the High Street._]    A castle with a keep and a moat, or rather a deep dry ditch, ought to  have memories of fighting, and Farnham Castle has seen some sharp  skirmishing. It has the distinction of having been twice held by a poet,  once for the Parliament and once for the King. George Wither was its  first commander, and his command did not increase his reputation either  as a man of letters or a man of war. Probably the castle was never worth  defending. It was isolated, and its possession, as it turned out, would  have helped neither side to control the movements of the other. But  Wither thought otherwise. He had made his name as a pastoral poet,  author of _Fidelia_ and _The Shepherd's Hunting_ and he now proposed to  make another name as a brilliant soldier. He saw all sorts of  possibilities in Farnham Castle and when the war broke out and he was  made Governor, he began at once building a drawbridge and a sallyport,  digging a well, and storing provisions. Unfortunately he had no  artillery, without which no self-respecting soldier could be expected to  hold a fort, even where, as at Farnham, there was no enemy within shot.  Riding up to London, he poured a perfect shower of requests into the  unwilling ears of Sir Richard Onslow, who was the chief pillar of the  Parliamentary party in Surrey, and at last he got an order for some  demi-culverins from the Tower. But his hopes were still to be dashed.  The next day came news that Prince Rupert was already in North Surrey,  and the demi-culverins were counter-ordered for fear of capture. Then  might he have light guns, drakes or falconets, which he could take along  by-roads? Sir Richard's answer was that the fortress, since it could not  be held, must be abandoned. For this decision Wither afterwards attacked  Sir Richard Onslow as a traitor, in two tremendous effusions entitled  _Se Defendendo_ and _Justitiarius Justificatus_, of which the latter  landed him in prison and was burnt by the common hangman. Meanwhile,  still protesting at being refused his guns, he rode down to his own  house at Alton, collected what carts and cattle he could find, took them  into Farnham, brought out all the stores and men he could command  through Farnham Park, and got them all safely to Kingston. He might have  been captured by Rupert; it was really quite an exploit.    So the castle came to the Royalists. They put in command of it Sir John  Denham, who in that very same year had published, anonymously, his  famous _Cooper's Hill_. Wither had left behind him three hundred sheep  and a hundred oxen, so that the garrison was well victualled, and the  poet-Governor ought to have been able to put up a fight against an enemy  who had no artillery. Wither would have shown him how to do it. But Sir  John had no idea of what a battle should be. One December morning, a few  days after he had taken over the command, Sir William Waller, a  Parliament General, rode up at the head of his dragoons and demanded  surrender. Of course Sir John refused, and Sir William proceeded to fix  a petard to the gate, to blow it in. A military genius like Wither would  have ordered his men to fire their muskets at the enemy; but all the  soldiers on both sides escaped that day. The explosive was securely  fastened in position, the gate was shattered, the assailants rushed at  the breach, and began at once to pull down the barricade of timber  erected inside by the garrison. This done, the garrison surrendered, and  the glorious day was over.    But Sir John Denham got the best of Wither in the end. Not long  afterwards Wither was taken prisoner by the Royalists, and Denham, who  had wisely been set at liberty to rejoin the Royalist forces, begged for  his rival's life. Mr. Wither, he pleaded, should not be hanged, for  while Wither lived he was not himself the worst poet in England.    The castle keep was never to be held by a successor to Wither and  Denham. Sir William Waller blew up one of the walls when he took it from  Sir John, and the year before Charles was executed Parliament ordered it  to be dismantled altogether. The garrison fell to with enthusiasm,  stripped the building of all the lead, wood, and glass they could lay  their hands on, and sold the wreck to make up their back pay. At the  Restoration, when Bishop Duppa came to the See, he found the castle  almost uninhabitable. It cost him more than two thousand pounds to make  it fit to live in, and his successor, Bishop Morley, spent even more. He  actually laid out ten thousand pounds in improvements, only to meet with  John Aubrey's criticism that he had repaired the building \"without any  regard to the rules of architecture.\" Doctor Peter Mew, who succeeded  Morley, set about improving the castle from outside, and planted the top  of the keep, into which the old walls had been tumbled, with fruit  trees. Bishop Sumner, who held the See for forty-two years from 1827,  turned the orchard into a garden.    Bishop Mew had a double record. He was a soldier as well as a prelate,  and he took part in the last battle fought on English soil. When King  Monmouth's Mendip miners were making their last stand at Sedgmoor, the  end of the fight came with the arrival of King James's artillery. The  heavy cannon might never have been drawn to the ground where the battle  was raging, for the artillery were unprovided with horses, had not the  Bishop offered his coach horses and traces. When they came to Sedgmoor,  he himself directed the fire.    The result of the various fortunes and misfortunes of the castle in war,  and of the different additions and alterations made by successive  Bishops, is naturally rather puzzling. The castle is a medley of the  building of eight centuries. Oldest of all is the ruined keep and the  framework, or foundations, of the castle buildings; the masonry of the  keep is the work of Henry of Blois, and belongs to the twelfth century.  Next come three pillars of the old chapel, now used as a servants' hall.  I saw it when it was set for a meal, and the severe cleanliness of the  white stone above the white tablecloth and glass and cutlery has  remained one of the distinctest of my memories of the castle. Next in  age is the outer gateway--doubtless the scene of Sir William Waller's  explosion--an imposing block of masonry. From each side of the gateway  runs the outer wall of the castle, and between the keep and the outer  wall what was once a ditch has grown into the Bishop's garden, a sloping  stretch of shaven lawn and flower borders, with a fountain and birds  bathing in it. The keep itself, almost from the broken parapet to the  tumbled stones at the base, is a mixture of wall and rock garden, in  which grow all the rock plants worth growing. Perhaps there were  wallflowers when Bishop Mew planted his orchard in the keep; but the  pasque flower and other rarer blossoms which crowd round the base belong  to the gardening of a later day. The level lawn and flower beds of the  inner garden of the keep are as serene and shining as those below, and  the view to the south over Hindhead and the south downs is finer and  freer than from anywhere in the grounds, though there are many fine  views from the castle windows. Fanny Burney, who visited Farnham in  1791, only a month released from the trammels of Court life, would  certainly have been able, as she tells us she wished, to see the hills  above her beloved Norbury. But ladies of the Court were delicate  creatures, and she could not climb to the top. \"I was ready to fall  already, from only ascending the slope to reach the castle,\" she adds  with some humility.    Of all the bishops, Bishop Fox left the most enduring mark on the  castle. He built the noble and lofty gateway tower named after him, and  certainly altered the look of the castle as Farnham sees it to-day, more  than any other Bishop, though what it may have looked like when the  boundary walls were all landing can only be guessed. Within, one of the  chief restorers was Bishop Morley. The hall, before he made his  alterations, was a good deal larger than the present room; you can see  the old doorway in the wall of the wide entrance passage. He added the  splendid staircases, with their carved oak newels, the work of Grinling  Gibbons; and he built the chapel, which also has some fine carving. A  later and most princely Bishop, Anthony Thorold, who held the See from  1891 to 1895, laid down a mile and a hundred yards of stair carpet, and  repaired an acre and a fifth of roof. He also fitted up rooms for  ordination candidates, each room with a name. St. Francis and other  saints preside over the slumbers of some; some sleep in Paradise; a  Bishop who is an occasional visitor looks out upon the Castle garden  from the Bull's Eye.    Bishop Morley, who spent so much money on the Castle, spent very little  on himself. A tiny room, almost a cell, is shown as the chamber in which  he spent hours in prayer, and in the extreme corner is a stone couch, on  which he slept when he allowed himself sleep. He had but one full meal a  day, he never warmed himself at a fire, he never married, he was never  ill, and was found dead on his bed one morning, at the ripe age of  eighty-seven. Starved to death, you are told; the hint is almost of  suicide.    Izaak Walton knew Morley, and stayed with him at the castle. He wrote  his Lives of Hooker and Herbert under the Bishop's roof, possibly added  something to his Life of Donne; the room is shown. I like to think of "]]]
