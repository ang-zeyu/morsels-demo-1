A regular gradation of immortal beings was acknowledged to preside  throughout universal nature from the Naiad, who was adored as the  tutelary guardian of a stream to Jupiter, the father of gods and men,  who ruled with Supreme power over heaven and earth.    The religion of the people extended little beyond the external honors  paid to the gods of their country and the attendance upon sacrifices and  processions. The sacred ceremonies were magnificent and public, except  that the votaries of Bacchus and Ceres were indulged in their secret  mysteries. The festivals were observed with every circumstance of pomp  and splendor to charm the eye and please the imagination. A sacrifice  was a feast attended with gayety and even licentiousness. Every temple  was the resort of the idle and the dissolute, and the shrines of the  Cyprian Venus and the Athenian Minerva could attest that devotion, far  from being a pure and exalted exercise of the mind, was only the  introduction to dissoluteness and debauchery.    The northern regions of Greece were particularly renowned for temples  from which oracles were issued. The temple of Apollo at Delphi, situated  upon a lofty rock near Parnassus, and that of Jupiter in the groves of  Dodona, were celebrated for the responses of the Pythia and the priests;  they were held in the greatest veneration for many ages, and their  oracles were consulted even in the most enlightened times by  philosophers themselves, who, in this instance, as well as many others,  conformed to the popular superstitions.    The spirit of the religion of ancient Greece was included in these  principles, that the worship of the gods was of superior obligation and  importance to all other duties, and that they frequently displayed their  power in this world in the punishment of the bad and the prosperity of  the virtuous. Such were the opinions inculcated by the most celebrated  philosophers and poets but the common people, more gratified by the  fictions of the received mythology, than by tenets of pure morals, found  in the actions recorded of their gods and goddesses a sufficient  justification of every species of licentiousness. With respect to a  future state of existence, the philosophers themselves appear to have  fluctuated in uncertainty, as may be collected from the sentiments of  Socrates. The poets inculcated a belief in Tartarus and Elysium. They  have drawn a picture of Tartarus in the most gloomy and horrific colors,  where men, who had been remarkable for impiety to the gods, such as  Tantalus, Tityus and Sisyphus, were tormented with a variety of misery  ingeniously adapted to their crimes.    The prospect of Elysium is beautiful and inviting, as described by  Homer, Hesiod and Pindar. In that delightful region there is no  inclement weather, but the soft zephyrs blow from the ocean to refresh  the inhabitants who live without care and anxiety; there the sky is  always serene and the sunshine is perpetual. The earth yields delicious  fruits for their sustenance three times per year. But these enjoyments  were confined to the persons who were of rank and distinction. Their  Elysium was a sensual heaven. How very different is the Christian's  future happy home?    Proteus informed Menelaus that he would be conveyed to the Islands of  the Blessed, because he was the husband of Helen, and the son-in-law of  Jupiter. No incentives to goodness from the consideration of a future  state are held out by the older poets to the female sex, or to the  ignoble or common people, however pure their conduct or exemplary their  virtue. In later times we find that Pindar extends his rewards to good  men in general; but Euripides is sometimes skeptical, and Iphigenia  without hesitation expresses her disbelief of the popular mythology.    The learned Jortin says, It gives us pleasure to trace in Homer the  important doctrine of a supreme God, a providence, and a free agency in  man, supposed to be consistent with fate or destiny; a difference  between moral good and evil, inferior gods or angels, some favorable to  men, others malevolent, and the immortality of the soul; but it gives us  pain to find these notions so miserably corrupted that they must have  had a very weak influence to excite men to virtue and deter them from  crime.--Jortin, Dissertation vi, p. 245.    This observation may be applied to the state of opinions even in the  most enlightened times of Greece, when the credulity and ignorance of  the common people, and the errors and doubts of the greatest  philosophers, proved the _necessity_ and the importance of the Christian  religion.    The possible attainments of a religious nature were very different from  ours. In the times of Lycurgus there were two hereditary kings or  presidents; their power was controlled by Lycurgus, through the gift of  equal authority to twenty-eight senators. The two kings commanded the  armies and high-priests of the temples. The senators were the executive  and legislative council of the state; with them the laws originated. The  assembly of the people elected the senators by saying yes or no to the  measures proposed to them, but had no right to discuss their  propriety--were not allowed the privilege.    Lycurgus allowed every family an equal amount of land; prohibited the  use of gold and silver, and made iron money the only currency of the  country, in order to check the avarice of the people. He forbade foreign  travel in order to retain the morals of his people, or keep them from  the corruptions of other nations. To produce a hardy people, he required  the women to indulge in all the athletic exercises of his government.  The children were inspected as soon as they were born, and those  considered worthy were handed over to the public nurses, and the  unworthy, that is, the deformed and sickly, were taken out and left in  the woods and upon the mountains to perish. All the children of the  Spartans were considered as the property of the state, and their  education consisted in accustoming them to endure the cravings of hunger  and thirst, with the scourge of discipline and every degree of  suffering. The business of Spartans consisted in preparing themselves  for war. They were disciplined in such a manner that it was necessary to  curb them constantly, lest they should rashly undertake to make  conquests. Out of this character of the Greeks arose that old saying,  \"When Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of war.\"    Many of the laws of the Spartans would, in this country at least,  destroy all the finer feeling, and inaugurate a reign of despotism  utterly at variance with Christianity. God's time to give to the  inhabitants of the earth the glorious system of our holy religion was  not until our race was educated, so as to be no longer the slaves of the  reigning ambition and passion of such men as Lycurgus. The Savior's hour  was several centuries from Lycurgus. Here it is appropriate to remark  that God, in his providence with the nations of men, has during all the  ages given to men just as fast as they were able to receive.          THE RELATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY TO HUMAN GREATNESS.      Some who deny the existence of spirit apart from matter allow that the  greatness of man consists in his being an eating animal. Others allow  that it lies in the fact that he is a working animal; while some have  allowed that it was found in the fact that he is a fighting animal. And  all _infidels_ agree in one thing, viz.: that man is simply an animal.  But the animal nature of man is not to be considered, with any degree of  truth, his crown of glory; his true greatness can not be identified with  it. We are acquainted with animals that can eat more, and seem to do it  with a greater relish. Others can run faster, jump higher, overcome  greater weight and outdo him in all manner of physical labor. They are  in possession of greater courage and fight with greater ferocity. So we  must search for man's greatness outside of all these elements of  character. Can we find no brighter, higher principles in the human  character? To do so we must lay aside the animal nature of man  altogether, and consider his character as it is blended with his  intellectual and moral nature. In other words, we must consider man as  man, not as an animal. We must consider him as a mind or spirit, and  look to something higher than eating, laboring at the helm, and  fighting, if we would discover his true greatness. In the improvement of  mind is the true improvement of man in all his relations. Without this  he is unqualified for all the various obligations that are necessary to  be discharged in order to the development of true greatness. To be great  a man must rise above the little, the mean, the vile and the degraded.  To do this he must be educated, trained, until the fruits of a virtuous  and useful intelligence are seen in his every-day life. Men are not  considered great nor admired for the simple development of physical  nature.    Infidels claim that cultivated literature is incompatible with religion.  It has been said that a man of ardent piety can not produce a work that  will live in after ages. This is a libel upon the truth, and upon him  who said: \"I am the truth.\"    Faith in God certainly places the maximum of greatness upon the human  mind. The man who believes in the existence of mind apart from matter,  and consequently looks upon death as a blessed state of rest to the good  man which lies between the two great activities of time and eternity,  and also believes in God and future rewards, has stronger motives to  sound moral rectitude than the man who denies and ridicules these great  truths. \"The seat of law is the bosom of God, and her voice is the  harmony of the world.\" It is respect for law that brings  responsibilities home"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28678"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#6)"],[1,"at the point where the  mistake was made. He must remain in perplexity until he finds the  mistake and corrects it. This law holds good in all our intellectual  operations. Many men are professedly in unbelief. How shall we get them  out? This is an important question and needs to be well studied by all  Christian ministers. If we can find out just how they got in, then it  will be easy to get the honest ones out. But it is well to remember that  many professed infidels are _only skeptics_ in heart. They are  unbelievers at will. The most effectual remedy for such unbelief, as yet  known, is an attack of cramp colic, or some other fearful affliction.  Under such circumstances they always surrender. There is not much chance  for Gospel means as long as a man's unbelief is simply a profession. His  disease is not one of the head, but of the heart; yet our law holds good  here. The man himself may repent; may make to himself a new heart and a  new spirit. This is his way out. If a man gets into unbelief through a  misunderstanding of Bible facts he will never get out short of a better  understanding of those same facts.    If he gets in through the impression that science and the Bible are in  conflict, there is no way to get him out short of a removal of the  impression. Hence the importance of ministers being scientists. Many  unbelievers claim that the Bible and science conflict, who have never  investigated them, and know comparatively nothing of either. This class,  too, is in the majority. They are men who ape certain leaders, being  under their influence. Many of them love to have us know that they know  something about such men as Strauss, notwithstanding their ignorance of  _even the man_. To have such a mind do their thinking is the highest of  their ambition. There is a good deal of heart disease about these  fellows. They really glory in the names of such men as Strauss. He was  so far away that they never learned the fact that \"he was divorced from  his wife, the former actress, Agnese Schebest, and spent his days going  about from place to place. His pseudo-theology or mythology ended in a  theatrical comedy, and the comedy in a tragedy.\" \"In 1839 this famous  Dr. Strauss--who resolved the gospel history of salvation into an  incoherent and self-contradictory mythological poem, and denied the  existence of a personal God and the immortality of the soul--was duly  elected professor of Christian dogmatics and ethics in the University of  Zurich, by the party then in power, which consisted mostly of demagogues  and frivolous infidels.\"    But the free Swiss would not submit, so the people of the Canton of  Zurich rose in their republican majesty and marched to the city under  the lead of an energetic pastor, and with the weapons which they hastily  collected scared the Strauss clique away; they very courageously took to  their heels; then the people of the Canton of Zurich placed the  government into the hands of conservative, trustworthy Christian men,  and quietly retired to their mountain homes without shedding a drop of  blood. The new government elected Mr. Lange in the place claimed, but  never occupied, by Strauss; but Mr. Strauss claimed half the salary, and  it is said that he enjoyed it, up to 1857 at least.    How much influence could such a man in our own country exert over the  American mind? For these facts touching the life of Strauss, see  \"Germany; Its Universities, Theology and Religion,\" by Phillip Schaff,  pages 101, 386. The reader may rely upon the quotations given above. I  have taken them with the book referred to open before me.    Infidels who investigate the Bible honestly, with reference to an  understanding of its contents, are unknown to us. The master spirits in  unbelief give abundant evidence of their ignorance of the scriptures of  the Bible. Not one in a thousand ever investigated the scriptures of the  Bible with pure and honest motives. Many have never investigated it at  all. To read a chapter here and there for the sole purpose of finding  fault and getting up a difficulty, is not investigation. An honest  investigation requires a very different course. All the evidence must be  brought into the court and presented in such a manner as to be  understood, just as it was given, otherwise the court is not qualified  to decide righteously in the case. That all such men as Col. Ingersoll  have failed to thus investigate the Bible is evident from the fact that  they, to be like him, must be infidels in all their history. It is  published to the world that the Colonel was born an infidel. He has been  hacking away at religion and the Bible ever since he was a small boy. So  his infidelity is not the result of an intelligent investigation of  either science or religion. I will not undertake to say what the  Colonel's trouble is, but if he was born an infidel it is possible,  according to our law, that he will die an unbeliever.    Many infidels, governed by a spirit of fanaticism, undoubtedly, have  labored with as much earnestness as if the world's salvation depended  upon their efforts, without the least hope of bettering its condition,  for the false philosophy of materialism which they advocate gives to a  man nothing to live for except his own animal nature. This philosophy  says all is well as long as you dodge the sharp corners of the laws of  your country. If the materialist can avoid paying fines, along with all  other penalties of the laws of his country, what need he care for one  course of life in preference to another? Do you say he has a conscience?  Well, it may be that it is not seared so that he is past feeling. Very  few men, I know, ever reach such a depraved condition. And this is  doubtless the greatest reason why all infidels, as a general rule, get  into mental distress during great bodily afflictions. Many of them are  converted by disease of the body, for two reasons: first, they were  unbelievers at will, just because it suited their desires, and, second,  because they are in possession of a religious nature or conscience. But  men who are converted by disease of the body are liable to go back to  the old wallow as soon as prosperity and health crown them again.    Many men are driven to irreligion through its abuses. I have often  thought it a misfortune that we Americans are under the necessity of  meeting the infidel literature of the old world, for the simple reason  that it is evolved out of the circumstances peculiar to state churches.  In America our religion is heroic; that is, it rests upon the merits of  its own evidence, and is supported by the voluntary contributions of the  people. But in Europe, where the mass of our infidel literature comes  from, Christianity is not free and independent, but entangled with the  affairs of state, and supported by the secular arm. The result is that  difficulties are continually arising out of the unholy alliance which  are disgusting to the independent scientific mind. The natural result is  to drive such persons into irreligion. Where men are educated in both  science and religion, and have not been all their lives called upon to  look upon religion in a secular light, tangled up in the interests of  politics and law, there should be no fears on account of any literature  that infidels may pass around. The misfortune that I speak of is not  with such men, but with the uneducated in religion and science, who are  more than anxious to find an excuse for irreligion. Christianity fears  nothing in the light.          *      *      *      *      *    The desires that have only a bodily end and aim, that are unconnected  with the high, holy, and noble purposes of a pure, true, and good life,  are false desires, and should be cast off.          COUNCILS--No. II.    UNITY OF THE ROMAN CHURCH.      In our October article on Councils we closed with the council that was  assembled by Mrs. Irene in the year 787. The Franks, having heard that a  council at Constantinople had ordained the adoration of images,  assembled, in the year 794, by order of Charles, son of Pepin,  afterwards named Charlemagne, a very numerous council. In this council  the second council of Nice is spoken of as an impertinent and arrogant  synod held in Greece for the promotion of the worship of pictures. This  council, held at Frankfort, was composed of three hundred clergymen from  England, Italy, France and Germany. Aventin, Hinemar and Regina say the  Frankfortians rescinded the decisions of the false Grecian synod in  favor of image worship.    In 842 a grand council was held at Constantinople, convened by the  Empress Theodora. Here the worship of images was solemnly established.  The Greeks still have a feast in honor of this council called  \"_Orthodoxia_.\" Theodora did not preside at this council.    \"In 861 a council was held at Constantinople consisting of three hundred  and eighteen bishops, assembled by the Emperor Michael. St. Ignatius,  patriarch of Constantinople, was deposed and Photius elected.    \"In 866 another council was held at Constantinople, in which Pope  Nicholas III. was deposed for contumacy and excommunicated.    \"In 869 was another council at Constantinople; in this Photius, in turn,  was deposed and excommunicated and St. Ignatius restored.    \"In 879 another council was held in Constantinople, in which Photius,  already restored, was acknowledged as true patriarch by the legates of  Pope John VIII., who declares all those to be Judases who say that the  Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.    \"In 1122-3 a council was held at Rome, in the church of St. John of  Lateran, by Pope Calixtus II. This was the first general council  assembled by the popes. The emperors of the west had now scarcely any  authority, and the emperors of the east, pressed by the Mahometans and  by the crusaders, held none but little wretched councils. In this  council the bishops complained heavily of the monks. 'They"]]]
