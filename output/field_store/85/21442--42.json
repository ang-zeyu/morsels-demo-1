My mother wus hired out before de  surrender an' had to leave her two chilluns at home on Marster's  plantation. When she come home Christmas he told her she would not have  to go back any more. She could stay at home. This wus de las' year o'  de war and he tol' her she would soon be free.    \"My eyes are mighty bad. De doctor said he would work on 'em if  somebody in de Agriculture Building would pay it.[4] I can't see at all  out of one eye and the other is bad.    \"I doan reckon I wus ten years old when de Yankees come, but I wus  runnin' around an' can remember all dis.

My missus wus named Laura. Mother always called me 'ole  Betsy' when she wus mad at me. Betsy wus Marster Peter's mother. I  remember seein' her. She wus a big fat 'oman wid white hair. She give  biscuits to all de chillun on Saturdays. She also looked out for de  slave chilluns on Sunday. My father wus named Marcillus Littlejohn and  my mother wus named Susan Littlejohn.    \"We had gardens and patches and plenty to eat. We also got de holidays.  Marster bought charcoal from de men which dey burnt at night an' on  holidays. Dey worked an' made de stuff, an' marster would let dem have  de steer-carts an' wagons to carry deir corn an' charcoal to sell it in  town. Yes sir, dis wus mighty nice. We had plank houses. Dere wus not  but one log house on de plantation. Marster lived in de big house. It  had eight porches on it.    \"Dere wus no churches on de plantation, an' I doan remember any prayer  meetin's. When we sang we turned de wash-pots an' tubs in de doors, so  dey would take up de noise so de white folks could not hear us. I do  remember de gatherin's at our home to pray fur de Yankees to come. All  de niggers thought de Yankees had blue bellies. The old house cook got  so happy at one of dese meetin's she run out in de yard an' called,  'Blue bellies come on, blue bellies come on.'

When dey sang awhile he would call  out one an' whup him. He had a sing fur everyone he whupped. Marster  growed up wid de niggers an' he did not like to whup 'em. If dey sassed  him he would put spit in their eyes and say 'now I recon you will mind  how you sass me.'    \"We had a lot o' game and 'possums. When we had game marster left de  big house, and come down an' et wid us. When marster wan't off drunk on  a spree he spent a lot of time wid de slaves. He treated all alike. His  slaves were all niggers. Dere were no half-white chilluns dere.    \"Marster would not let us work until we were thirteen years old. Den he  put us to plowin' in soft lan', an' de men in rough lan'. Some of de  women played off sick an' went home an' washed an' ironed an' got by  wid it. De oberseer tried to make two of 'em go back to work. Dey flew  at him an' whupped him. He told de marster when he come home, marster  said, 'Did you 'low dem women to whup you?' 'Yes', he replied, den  marster tole him if women could whup him he didn't want him. But he let  him stay on. His name wus Jack Rivers. He wus hired by marster.

When marster"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31234"],[0,"A History of the English Church in New Zealand (#6)"],[1,", at least with white folk for the victims--threw  the people of New South Wales into a fever heat of indignation. This  condition was further intensified when the intelligence arrived that  among the murderers had been seen the \"worthy and respectable\" Te Pahi,  who had been an honoured guest at the Governor's table. No Maori dared  now to be seen in the streets of Sydney, and it required all Marsden's  influence to protect Ruatara, who was known to be Te Pahi's relative.  His protector kept him for six months quietly working with a few other  Maoris on his farm at Parramatta, and the expedition to New Zealand was  for the time abandoned.    This sudden interruption of his favourite project was a severe trial to  Marsden's hopeful temperament. But he never lost heart. \"We have not  heard the natives' side of the case,\" he said. As for Te Pahi, he  refused, and rightly refused, to believe in his guilt. When the passion  for vengeance had somewhat calmed, he found opportunity to ship Ruatara  and some other Maoris on board a whaling craft which was on her way to  fish on the New Zealand shores, and he gave them seed wheat and  agricultural tools.    Even now Ruatara's adventures were not ended. In the following year he  was again at Port Jackson with another tale of woe. He had never reached  his home, though he had actually been within sight of it. Instead of  being allowed to land there, he had been carried away by the  unprincipled captain, robbed again of his wages, and then marooned on  Norfolk Island. Again he found a friend in Marsden. Once more he was  despatched to the Bay of Islands with wheat and hoes and spades. This  time he arrived safely, and Marsden had the satisfaction of feeling that  however long the time of waiting might still be, there was a quiet but  effective influence at work in New Zealand on behalf of himself and of  the message which he still hoped to proclaim.    At any time, in fact, during those years of suspense, Marsden was  willing to venture forth among the cannibals, but he was forbidden by  Governor Macquarie. That all-powerful functionary was determined that  such a valuable life should not be thrown away on what appeared to be a  quixotic scheme. But the chaplain was not to be altogether balked. He  received into his parsonage whatever Maoris of good standing he could  find; showed them the varied activities of his model farm; and explained  to them the principles of the laws which he was called to administer  from the magisterial bench. In this way several young chiefs acquired a  knowledge of the elements of civilisation, and were disposed to welcome  Christianity.    But it was not only upon his Maori visitors that Marsden's influence was  at work. The two artisans whom he kept near himself must have learned  during these years that absolute loyalty upon which so much was to  depend thereafter. They laboured diligently at their trades, and each  was soon earning as much as L400 a year; but the zeal and unselfishness  of the chaplain kept them true to their original purpose, and prevented  them from yielding to the fascinations of Mammon.    Thus the years passed--not uselessly nor unhopefully. One bit of  intelligence seemed like an augury of good for the future: Ruatara's  wheat had been sown and was growing well!    [Illustration: THE NORTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND.]          CHAPTER II.    THE ENTERPRISE.    (1813-1815).      Was it not great? Did not he throw on God        (He loves the burthen)    God's task to make the heavenly period        Perfect the earthen?      --_R. Browning._      The fourth year of waiting brought signs of approaching change. The  Society at home, encouraged by Marsden's hopeful letters, sent out  another catechist, Thomas Kendall. They were less sure of him than of  King and Hall, but he pleaded earnestly to be sent, and, being a  schoolmaster, he was a man of more education than the two others. During  the last days of the year 1813, Marsden organised an influential meeting  in Sydney, and succeeded in carrying fifteen resolutions in favour of a  forward movement. Armed with these he again approached the Governor, who  reluctantly consented to allow the missionaries to make a trial visit to  New Zealand if a captain could be found sufficiently courageous to take  them. The shipping problem was indeed a great difficulty, but Marsden at  last overcame it by buying a vessel with money which he raised on the  security of his farm. The _Active_ was a brig of 110 tons, and claims  the honour of being the first missionary craft of modern times.    Hall and Kendall were the men chosen for the preliminary visit. They  were instructed to open up communication with Ruatara, and, if possible,  to bring him back with them to Sydney. With good supply of articles for  trade and for presents they set sail on the 4th of March, and arrived  safely at the Bay of Islands. Here they were welcomed by the faithful  Ruatara, to whom they presented a small hand-mill as a gift from his  friend at Parramatta. This machine played its part in preparing the way  for the mission. Ruatara's wheat had long been harvested, but his  neighbours were still sceptical as to the possibility of converting it  into bread. While this doubt remained, Ruatara's words carried little  weight. In vain did the poor Maori try one expedient after another; in  vain did he send appeals to Marsden. His own efforts always failed; his  benefactor's gifts never reached him. But now the situation was changed.  The mill was at once charged with New Zealand grown wheat; eager eyes  watched the mealy stream issuing from beneath; a cake was quickly made  and cooked; and all incredulity was at an end. Several chiefs  volunteered to accompany Ruatara to Sydney, and the _Active_ reached  that port on August 22nd, after a thoroughly successful voyage.    The Governor could no longer withhold his consent to the enterprise, and  Marsden was granted leave of absence for four months from his duties at  Parramatta.    Before starting for New Zealand he spent three busy months in  preparation. The mission was to take the form of a \"settlement,\" and the  missionaries were to be \"settlers\" as well as catechists. The _Active_  was loaded with all that was necessary for this object, and in the words  of Mr. Nicholas, who accompanied the expedition as a friend, it \"bore a  perfect resemblance to Noah's Ark.\" The resemblance was indeed a close  one. The vessel carried horses and cattle, sheep and pigs, goats and  poultry; Maori chiefs and convict servants; the three missionaries with  their wives and children; while the place of the patriarch was filled by  Samuel Marsden himself, who, like Noah, had been \"warned of God of  things not seen as yet,\" had laboured on amidst the incredulity of his  neighbours, and now bore with him the seeds of a new world. Stormy  weather delayed the progress of the brig and brought much misery to  those on board. Three weeks passed before the New Zealand coast was  sighted, but Saturday, December 17th, brought the travellers opposite to  Tasman's \"Three Kings,\" and on the following Tuesday they were off the  harbour of Whangaroa, where the remains of the _Boyd_ still lay. The  brig did not enter this dreaded haven, but, seeing an armed force on the  coast to the south, Marsden resolved to land and to attempt to  conciliate these hostile people. Ruatara and Hongi acted as  intermediaries, and friendly relations were soon established between the  missionaries and the cannibals. Marsden and his companion even spent the  night with the savages, sleeping among them without fear under the  starlit sky.    Two days later the expedition reached its destination, and the _Active_  cast anchor off the Bay of Rangihoua. From her deck the mission families  could now gaze upon the scene of their future home. The bracken and  manuka with which the farther slopes were clad might remind them of the  fern and heather of old England, but their gaze would be chiefly  attracted to an isolated hill of no great height which rose steeply from  the sea on the left side of the little bay. To this hill had come the  remnant of Te Pahi's people after the slaughter on the island, and it  was now crowned with a strongly fortified _pa_. Ruatara's residence was  on the highest point; around it were crowded about fifty other  dwellings; outside the mighty palisade neat plantations of potatoes and  kumaras seemed to hang down the steep declivity; an outer rampart  encircled the whole. At sight of the vessel the inhabitants rushed down  to the beach with cries of welcome, and greeted Marsden, on his landing,  with affectionate regard. He seemed to be no stranger among them, for  his name and his fame were familiar to all. The horses and cows caused a  temporary panic among people who had never seen animals so large  before, but fear soon gave way to admiration and a general sense of  excited expectancy.    Ruatara's home-coming was not free from pain to himself. Misconduct had  occurred in his household during his absence, and the next morning was  occupied with a trial for adultery. The case was referred to Marsden,  who advised the application of the lash to the male offender. Thirty  strokes were given, and the honour of the chief was vindicated. Next  morning (Saturday) he treated his guests to a scene of mimic warfare.  Led by himself and Korokoro, four hundred warriors in all the pomp of  paint and feathers rehearsed the details of a naval engagement. The  brandished spears and blood-curdling yells brought forcibly to the  imagination of the white men the perils which might be in store for  them, but as the day wore on the arts of war were succeeded by  preparations for the preaching of the Gospel of peace. Ruatara caused  about half an acre of land by the Oihi beach to be fenced in; within  this area he improvised some rough seats with planks and an upturned  boat; in a convenient spot he erected a reading"]]]
