Nor did he forget how the fruit tasted. He never took a  bite of it again; but, after that, his favourite trick was to treat  the other beasts to the wonderful fruit just to see them make faces  when they tasted it.          IX    How the Monkey and the Goat    Earned Their Reputations      Once upon a time the tiger sent an invitation to the goat asking the  goat to accompany him on a visit. The goat promptly accepted the  invitation and at the appointed day they started on their journey to  the house of the tiger's friend. On the way there they came to a  dangerous marsh. The tiger was afraid to cross it, but he pretended to  be very brave. He said to the goat: \"Friend Goat, how very pale you  look when you think about crossing the marsh. Don't be afraid. Just go  ahead.\"    The goat assured the tiger that he was no coward. He thrust out his  chest and marched along toward the marsh like a brave soldier. As  soon, however, as he stepped into the marsh, he fell into the mud and  barely got through it alive. The tiger went around the marsh and  walked on dry ground.    After the tiger and the goat had come together again they came to some  banana trees. The tiger said to the goat: \"Friend Goat, aren't you  hungry? Let us stop here and eat some bananas. You climb up and pluck  the bananas. Give me the ripe ones, and keep the green ones yourself.\"  The goat climbed up and picked the bananas. He gave the ripe ones to  the tiger and the tiger had a good meal. The goat went hungry.    The tiger and the goat walked along and after going for some distance  they saw a cobra lying in the path. \"Friend Goat,\" said the tiger,  \"here you have the opportunity to procure a beautiful necklace for  your daughter, free of cost. Just pick it up and it is yours.\" The  goat started forward to pick up the snake, but the tiger told him to  let it alone if he did not want to be killed.    When the tiger and the goat arrived at the house of the tiger's friend  it was very late. They soon went to bed in hammocks hung close  together. At midnight the tiger rose quietly, walked on tip toe to the  door, opened it, and went out. He hurried to the place where the sheep  were kept, killed the fattest lamb of the flock, and had a feast. Then  he went back to the hammock, wiped the blood on the goat, and went to  sleep.    Early the next morning the host discovered that one of his lambs was  missing. He hastened to the room where the tiger and the goat were  sleeping and accused the tiger of having killed the lamb. The tiger  looked up at him with an innocent expression and asked, \"Do you see  any blood on me?\" There was no blood on the tiger, but the host looked  into the next hammock and saw the goat all covered with blood. \"I know  now who killed my fattest lamb,\" he said, and he gave the goat such a  beating that the poor goat barely escaped with his life. From that day  to this when one speaks of a person who has been easily imposed upon  he calls him \"the goat.\"    Things happened very differently with the monkey. One day not long  afterward the tiger invited the monkey to accompany him when he went  to visit his friend. The monkey accepted, and the tiger and the monkey  set out on the journey. When they came to the marsh the tiger said to  the monkey, \"Friend Monkey, how very pale you look when you think  about crossing the marsh. Don't be afraid. Just go ahead.\"    \"You go ahead yourself,\" replied the monkey. The tiger went through  the marsh and fell into the mud so that he was barely able to get out  again. The monkey went around the marsh and walked on dry ground.    After a while the tiger and the monkey came to the banana trees.  \"Friend Monkey,\" said the tiger, \"aren't you hungry? Let us stop here  and eat some bananas. You climb up and pluck the bananas. Give the  ripe ones to me and you may keep the green ones for yourself.\" The  monkey climbed up and picked the bananas but he ate all the ripe ones  himself and threw the green ones down to the tiger. The tiger was  forced to go hungry but the monkey had a good meal.    Finally the tiger and the monkey came to a cobra lying in the path.  \"Friend Monkey,\" said the tiger, \"here you have the opportunity to  procure a beautiful necklace for your daughter, free of cost. Pick it  up and it is yours.\"    \"Pick it up yourself,\" replied the monkey.    When the tiger and the monkey arrived at the house of the tiger's  friend it was very late. They went to bed in hammocks hung up close  together. The monkey had seen enough of the tiger that day to make him  decide that he had better sleep with one eye open. Accordingly he  pretended he was asleep, but he was really awake. At midnight he saw  the tiger crawl quietly out of his hammock, walk on tip toe to the  door, open it gently, and go out. The monkey decided to watch and see  what happened when the tiger came back.    The tiger went to the place where the sheep were kept, killed the  fattest lamb of the flock and had a feast. When he came back he tried  to wipe the lamb's blood on the monkey. The monkey saw him and gave  him a push so that he spilled the blood all over himself and his own  hammock. Not a single drop went on the monkey.    Early the next morning when the host missed one of his lambs he came  to the room where his guests were sleeping. He saw the tiger all  covered with blood and he cried, \"O ho, I have at last caught the one  who kills my lambs.\" Then he gave the tiger such a beating that he  barely escaped with his life. It was all he could do to crawl home  again.          X    How the Monkey Got a Drink    When He Was Thirsty      Once upon a time the monkey made the tiger very angry. This is how it  happened. The monkey was seated high up among the leafy branches of a  mango tree playing upon his guitar. The tiger passed that way and lay  down under the tree to rest. Just to tease him the monkey played and  sang this little song:        \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,      The tiger's bones are in my guitar.      Tee hee, Tee hee._\"    The tiger was very angry. \"Just wait until I catch you, Mr. Monkey,\"  he said. \"Then I'll show you a trick or two with bones.\"    The monkey leaped from one tree to another keeping himself so well hid  by the foliage that the tiger could not see him. Then he came down out  of the trees and hid himself in a hole in the ground. When the tiger  came near he again played and sang his little song:        \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,      The tiger's bones are in my guitar.      Tee hee, Tee hee._\"    The tiger put his paw into the hole and caught the monkey's leg. \"Oh,  ho, Mr. Tiger!\" said the monkey. \"You think that you have caught my  leg but what you really have is just a little stick. Oh, ho! Oh, ho!\"  Then the tiger let go of the monkey's leg.    The monkey crawled farther back into the hole in the ground where the  tiger's paw could not reach him. Then he said: \"Thank you so much, Mr.  Tiger, for letting go of my leg. It really was my leg, you know.\"  Again he played and sang his little song:        \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,      The tiger's bones are in my guitar.      Tee hee, Tee hee._\"    The tiger was angrier than ever. He waited and waited for the monkey  to come out of the hole in the ground but the monkey did not come. He  had discovered another way out and once more from the high tree tops  he sang down to the waiting tiger:        \"_Tango ti tar, tango ti tar,      The tiger's bones are in my guitar.      Tee hee, Tee hee._\"    There had been a great drought in the land and there was only one  watering place where the beasts could drink. The tiger knew that the  monkey would have to go there when he was thirsty so he decided to  wait for him and catch him when he came to drink.    When the monkey went to the watering place to get a drink he found the  tiger there waiting for him. He ran away as fast as the wind for he  was really very much afraid of the tiger.    He waited and waited until he thought he should die of thirst, but the  tiger did not go away from the watering place for a single minute. At  last the monkey thought of a trick by which he would be able to get a  drink.    He lay down by the side of the pathway as if he were dead. After a  while an old woman came along the path carrying a dish of honey in a  basket upon her head. She saw the monkey lying there by the path and,  thinking that he was dead, she picked him up and put him into the  basket with the dish of honey. When the monkey saw that it was honey  in the dish he was very happy. He opened the dish and covered himself  all over with the soft sticky honey. Then as the old woman walked  under the trees he lightly sprang out of the basket into the trees.  The old woman did not miss him until she got home and found only part  of her dish of honey in the basket. \"Why, I thought I had brought  home a dead monkey in my basket,\" she said to her children. \"Now  there is no monkey here and my dish is only half full of honey. The  monkey must have been playing one of his tricks.\"    The monkey had, in the meantime, stuck leaves from the trees into the  honey all over his body so that he was completely disguised. His own  mother would never have recognised him. He looked something like a  porcupine; but instead of sharp quills there were green leaves  sticking out all over him. In this fashion he went to the drinking  place and the tiger did not recognise him. He took a long, deep drink.  He was so thirsty and the water tasted so good that he stayed in the  drinking place too long. The leaves came out of the honey which had  held them and the tiger saw that it was really the monkey. The monkey  was barely able to escape.    He was so badly frightened that he waited and waited a long, long time  before he again went to the drinking place. At last he got so thirsty  that he couldn't wait any longer. He went to the resin tree and  covered "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#6)"],[1,"railroad stations, the ferries leading to  Brooklyn, Jersey City and Staten Island--everywhere, in fact, where  there is a chance of disposing of the afternoon newspaper.    The larger number of these little girls emerge from their hiding-places  about eleven o'clock in the morning. Their hiding-places may have been a  hotel, an assignation house, their parents' homes, some hallway, the  News Girls' Lodging House, resorts in North William, Bayard, Hester, New  Bowery, or any other street in which cheap rooms can be obtained. It is  not to be presumed that all news-girls are bad; on the contrary, many  are very good, respectable little things, but a few only remain so, for  their associations are bad, and many men who purchase papers from them  are constantly tempting them, so that it is very difficult for any of  them to remain good for any length of time.    Be that as it may, however, the news girl in this case arrives down-town  about noon. She strolls down among the brokers and bankers, and in many  cases is winked at, conversed with and asked to visit different offices,  which invitation is generally accepted, for a little money is to be made  by the call, with which the afternoon papers are purchased. Sometimes  the selling of papers is merely a pretext under which a better  opportunity is afforded of conversing with men. The papers are hawked in  saloons, upon the streets, in cars, and other places. If any one should  chance to buy a paper and offers a nickel, the girl invariably has no  change; when the purchaser, nine times out of ten, tells her to keep the  change. They are extremely shrewd, smart, intelligent and wide awake.    Their papers all sold, about nine or ten o'clock at night they saunter  up Chatham street, the Bowery and other thoroughfares; or, if it is the  summer season, they will be found in the City Hall park, playing,  sitting on the benches, or accosting passing pedestrians. The Battery,  too, has its frequenters, and the piers and docks at night are crowded  with them. This life they pursue until they engage regularly in a life  of shame, by becoming regular boarders in some one of the many dives in  the cellars of Chatham street, the houses of prostitution in Forsyth,  Hester, Canal, Bayard and other streets. Or, again, they may be found  in the various pretty-waiter-girl saloons of the Bowery, or such  notorious resorts as Hilly McGlory's, Owney Geoghegan's, and so on. The  public parks, however, are favorite places, and they may be found even  in Union Square and Madison Square, and sometimes in Central Park. They  enjoy themselves, too, for they are often seen on picnics in summer and  at balls during the winter. They have their favorites among the opposite  sex, too, just as have more favored and aristocratic females. For the  love of one of these little girls--Mary Maguire--a member of the  notorious Mackerelville gang met a tragic end, at the hands of a jealous  rival in City Hall park, by being stabbed to death. Little Mary was only  fourteen years of age. She was afterwards sent to the House of the Good  Shepherd.    Newsboys are largely responsible for leading girls of this class into  the tempting paths of vice. In purchasing their papers at the newspaper  offices, generally in cellars, they are subjected to many indignities  and familiarities, which, at first resented, are gradually accepted as a  matter of course. Once the descent is begun, the journey is completed by  outsiders, until the girls become corrupt and unscrupulous, with a  knowledge of the ways of the world that would surprise many a matronly  head.    In many cases, girls of five and six years are sent out as decoys by the  larger ones to \"rope in\" customers; for detectives and agents of the  various societies, on the lookout for depraved girls, teach those young  Messalinas caution. When one of these smaller girls has secured a  customer she pilots the way to the place where the larger ones are to be  found. In one instance this was a cellar, under ground, not fifty feet  from the corner of Chatham and William streets; outwardly an oyster  saloon, but a door opened in a wooden partition, through which one  entered another room, and in which, at one time, there were actually no  less than nine small girls, ranging in age from ten to sixteen years.    There are a few places where these girls resort in the day-time and  remain all day, and where they are visited by regular frequenters of the  houses. Here, also, may be found those young girls who, leaving home in  the morning and telling their parents they are going to work, remain all  day; returning home again in the evening with, perhaps, a couple of  dollars in their pockets, and at the end of the week hand their parents  what the old people innocently suppose is the week's wages of their  daughters, honestly obtained.    There are old-time procuresses, who, having once been news-girls  themselves, know just how to proceed to capture recruits for Hester  street boarding-houses, and they obtain them, too, from the ranks  mentioned. Parents that drive their children in the streets to get  money, and beat them if they fail to fetch it home, are generally sure  to either make prostitutes of their little ones or have them run away  entirely, particularly when a tempting offer is made them by male or  female. There are thousands of men in this city, as well as there are in  London, who employ procuresses, whose efforts and operations,  unfortunately, are not confined to news-girls, but include the pretty  daughters of well-to-do mechanics and trades people.    Many of these girls become closely identified with the lives of  Chinamen, and it is astonishing how fond some of these girls become of  their almond-eyed protectors.    Should any observant individual pass through Elizabeth, Bleecker, Canal,  Hester, Bayard, Dover, Pell, Mott, Baxter, Rose, Chambers streets, and  the other localities mentioned, at night, he will see what becomes of  the pretty news-girls. But there are instances in which they have  obtained work in various factories and wholesale houses and remained  respectable.    Thus far, the news-girl. Of the pretty flower girl--she with the  engaging manner, and interesting face above a tray of flowers--not much  remains to be said, for she has almost become an institution of the  past. Thrown upon her own resources, from like causes affecting others  of her sex, she was once to be met with in the lobby of every theatre in  town, every resort where gentlemen were supposed to frequent,  club-houses, drinking saloons, omnibuses, cars, and the streets. Even  houses of ill fame found her gently and firmly looking for trade.  Wherever there was a chance to intercept a gentleman, there was she, and  her importunities to purchase were redoubled when a lady accompanied a  gentleman. They did a thriving business in the pretty-waiter-girl  saloons, for men could hardly escape them, and nearly all bought  bouquets for their favorites in those places.    It is safe to say that very few of the flower girls were virtuous. They  remained out until all hours of the night and plied a double trade,  selling both their flowers and themselves. There was one well-known  house in Thirteenth street which these little girls made a headquarters.  It was between Broadway and University place. The proprietress had no  other \"ladies\" but flower girls, as she found them more profitable,  charged them higher prices for accommodations, whether by the day or  week, and as but few places would assume the risk of harboring the  waifs, they were compelled to pay her extortionate rates.    Some time since a man could hardly pass along Fourteenth street or Union  Square, at night, without his being accosted by one of these girls, who,  instead of asking him to purchase flowers, would invariably remark,  \"Give me a penny, mister?\" by which term, afterwards, all these girls of  loose character were known to ply their trade. Many of these girls were  so exceedingly handsome as to be taken by gentlemen of means and well  cared for, and one instance is known where a flower girl married a very  wealthy man of middle age.    As a class, they were excessively immoral. They purchased their flowers,  out and out, from the florists and made handsome profits, amounting to  as much as two and three dollars a night when the weather was fine; but  their habits and immoralities became so patent that the societies put a  stop to their selling, by sending some to the House of the Good  Shepherd, and arresting others for soliciting and other unlawful acts;  so that to-day it is very much to be doubted if there are more than half  a dozen in the city.    \"Wharf rats,\" street gamins, Arabs, and other euphonious terms are  applied to that class of boys, who, having no homes, make one for  themselves in the streets. They black boots--some of them--in the  day-time, sell newspapers in the afternoons, lie in wait for incoming  travelers from the trains to carry satchels, etc., and make a little  money from all sources to supply themselves with food and raiment. The  balance, if any is left, they spend in going to the gallery of some  theatre, visiting some museum, or adjourning to their favorite haunt--  which frequently is a low beer-dive in some obscure street, play pool or  cards or dice for drinks, and otherwise contrive to kill time, until  their \"business\" of the next day begins.    It used to be a familiar sight to see the saloons of Baxter, Mott and  Mulberry streets filled with these boys. It was only a few years ago  that they had their own theatre, yclept \"The Grand Duke's Theatre,\" at  21 Baxter street, in the cellar under a stale beer dive, where really  clever performances were given of an imitative character, by a company  of boys; and which, by the way, was the only theatre which for years  defied the efforts of the authorities to collect the license. The  admission fee was ten"]]]
