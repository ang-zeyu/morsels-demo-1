[Illustration: Figure 47.--18TH CENTURY: The visually pleasing qualities  of walnut and brass provide a level of response to this joiner's bevel  quite apart from its technical significance. (Private collection.  Smithsonian photo 49793-B.)]    [Illustration: Figure 48.--18TH CENTURY: THE HANDLE OF THE COMPASS SAW,  characteristically Dutch in shape, is an outstanding example of a  recurring functional design, one which varied according to the hand of  the sawer. (Smithsonian photo 49789-C.)]    Henry Ward Beecher, impressed by the growing sophistication of the  toolmakers, described the hand tool in a most realistic and objective  manner as an \"extension of a man's hand.\" The antiquarian, attuned to  more subjective and romantic appraisals, will find this hardly  sufficient. Look at the upholsterer's hammer (accession 61.35) seen in  figure 45: there is no question that it is a response to a demanding  task that required an efficient and not too forceful extension of the  workman's hand. But there is another response to this implement: namely,  the admiration for an unknown toolmaker who combined in an elementary  striking tool a hammerhead of well-weighted proportion to be wielded  gently through the medium of an extremely delicate handle. In short,  here is an object about whose provenance one need know very little in  order to enjoy it aesthetically. In a like manner, the 18th-century  bitstock of Flemish origin (fig. 46), the English cabinetmaker's bevel  of the same century (fig. 47), and the compass saw (accession 61.52,  fig. 48) capture in their basic design something beyond the functional  extension of the craftsman's hand. The slow curve of the bitstock, never  identical from one early example to another, is lost in later  factory-made versions; so too, with the coming of cheap steel, does the  combination of wood (walnut) and brass used in the cabinetmaker's bevel  slowly disappear; and, finally, in the custom-fitted pistol-like grip of  the saw, there is an identity, in feeling at least, between craftsman  and tool never quite achieved in later mass-produced versions.    [Illustration: Figure 49.--EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE DESIGNATION  \"GENTLEMAN'S TOOL CHEST\" required a chest of \"high-style\" but  necessitated no change in the tools it held. (Book 87, Cutler and  Company, Castle Hill Works, Sheffield. _Courtesy of the Victoria and  Albert Museum_.)]    [Illustration: Figure 50.--19TH CENTURY: THE SCREWDRIVER, which began to  appear regularly on the woodworker's bench after 1800, did not share the  long evolution and tradition of other Anglo-American tool designs. The  screwdriver in its early versions frequently had a scalloped blade for  no other purpose than decoration. (Smithsonian photo 49794.)]    [Illustration: Figure 51.--1870: THE USE of a new material prompted a  departure from the traditional in shape and encouraged surface  elaboration. The tendency, however, was short lived and the  mass-produced metallic plane rapidly achieved a purity of design as  pleasing as its wooden predecessors. (Private collection. Smithsonian  photo 49789.)]    Occasionally, ruling taste is reflected in the design of the carpenter's  equipment. Notable is the \"gentleman's tool chest\" (fig. 49) advertised  in the pattern book of the Castle Hill Works. The bracket feet, brass  pulls, and inlaid keyholes imitate the style of the domestic chest of  drawers of the period 1790 to 1810--undoubtedly, features included by  the manufacturer to appeal to a gentleman of refined taste. In contrast  to this Sheffield product is the plate from Shaw's _The Modern  Architect_. The concept of the builder-carpenter as a gentleman still  prevails, although the idea in this American scene is conveyed in the  mid-19th century through fashionable dress. The tools and in particular  the tool chest reflect only the severest of functional lines (fig. 19,  p. 196).    In deference to ruling taste, some tools lost for a time the clean lines  that had long distinguished them. The screwdriver, simple in shape  (accession 61.46) but in little demand until the 1840's, occasionally  became most elaborate in its factory-made form (fig. 50) and departed  noticeably from the unadorned style of traditional English and American  tools. The scalloped blade, influenced by the rival styles rather than a  technical need, seemed little related to the purpose of the tool.[10]  No less archaic in decoration was the iron-bodied version of the plow  plane (fig. 51). The Anglo-American tradition seems completely put  aside. In its place is a most functional object, but one elaborately  covered with a shell and vine motif! Patented in 1870 by Charles Miller  and manufactured by the Stanley Rule and Level Company, this tool in its  unadorned version is of a type that was much admired by the British  experts at Philadelphia's Centennial Exhibition in 1876. What prompted  such superfluous decoration on the plow plane? Perhaps it was to appeal  to the flood of newly arrived American craftsmen who might find in the  rococo something reminiscent of the older tools they had known in  Europe. Perhaps it was simply the transference to the tool itself of the  decorative work then demanded of the wood craftsmen. Or was it mainly a  compulsion to dress, with little effort, a lackluster material that  seemed stark and cold to Victorians accustomed to the ornateness being  achieved elsewhere with the jigsaw and wood? Whatever the cause, the  result did not persist long as a guide to hand-tool design. Instead, the  strong, plain lines that had evolved over two centuries won universal  endorsement at the Centennial Exhibition. The prize tools reflected  little of the ornateness apparent in the wares of most of the other  exhibitors. American makers of edge tools exhibiting at the Centennial  showed the world not only examples of quality but of attractiveness as  well.    [Illustration: Figure 52.--19TH CENTURY: THE AMERICAN AXE WAS UNEXCELLED  in design and ease of use. European observers praised it as distinctly  American. At the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 Collins and Company of  New York City was singled out as one of the outstanding manufacturers  exhibiting these axes, a reputation that persisted. (_Tools for all  Trades_, Hammacher, Schlemmer and Company, New York, 1896.

Smithsonian photo 56627.)]      Change    American hand tools in 1876 did not achieve the popular acclaim accorded  the Corliss engine, yet few products shown by American exhibitors were  more highly praised by foreign experts. It seems justified to suggest  that American edge tools displayed at the Centennial had reached their  high point of development--a metamorphosis that began with the medieval  European tool forms, moved through a period of reliance on English  precedents, and ended, in the last quarter of the 19th century, with the  production of American hand tools \"occupying an enviable position before  the world.\"[11]    [Illustration: Figure 54.--1809: THE INTRODUCTION of the gimlet-pointed  auger followed Ezra L'Hommedieu's patent of 1809. From this date until  its general disuse in the early 20th century, the conformation of the  tool remained unchanged, although the quality of steel and the precision  of the twist steadily improved. (Wash drawing from the restored patent  drawings awarded July 31, 1809, U.S. Patent Office, Record Group 241,  the National Archives.

(Original wash drawing, patent drawing  submitted by R. Jennings, U.S. Patent Office, Record Group 241, the  National Archives.)]    The tool most highly praised at Philadelphia was the American felling  axe (fig. 52) \"made out of a solid piece of cast steel\" with the eye  \"punched out of the solid.\" When compared to other forms, the American  axe was \"more easily worked,\" and its shape permitted an easier  withdrawal after striking.[12]    Sawmakers, too, were singled out for praise--in particular Disston &  Sons (fig. 53) for \"improvements in the form of the handles, and in the  mode of fixing them to the saw.\" The Disston saw also embodied an  improved blade shape which made it \"lighter and more convenient by  giving it a greater taper to the point.\" Sheffield saws, once supplied  to most of the world, were not exhibited at Philadelphia, and the  British expert lamented that our \"monopoly remains with us no  longer.\"[13]    [Illustration: Figure 56.--1894: THE PERSISTENCE OF \"JENNINGS\" AS A  TRADE NAME is suggested by the vignette from the \"Illustrated Catalogue\"  of Baldwin, Robbins and Company, published in 1894.

[and] in the workshops of joiners, carpenters, cabinetmakers, turners,  carvers, and by amateurs and others,\" were considered a \"most important  exhibit\" at the Centennial. The auger had attained a perfection in \"the  accuracy of the twist, the various forms of the cutters, the quality of  the steel, and fine finish of the twist and polish.\" The ancient pod or  shell auger had nearly disappeared from use, to be replaced by \"the  screwed form of the tool\" considerably refined by comparison to  L'Hommedieu's prototype, patented in 1809 (fig"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#6)"],[1,"  little natural dignity. The old Romans boasted that their republic was a  nation of kings. If we really walked abroad in such a kingdom, we might  very well grow tired of the sight of a crowd of kings, of every man with  a gold crown on his head or an ivory sceptre in his hand. But it is  arguable that we ought not to grow tired of the repetition of crowns and  sceptres, any more than of the repetition of flowers and stars. The  whole imaginative effort of Walt Whitman was really an effort to absorb  and animate these multitudinous modern repetitions; and Walt Whitman  would be quite capable of including in his lyric litany of optimism a  list of the nine hundred and ninety-nine identical bathrooms. I do not  sneer at the generous effort of the giant; though I think, when all is  said, that it is a criticism of modern machinery that the effort should  be gigantic as well as generous.    While there is so much repetition there is little repose. It is the  pattern of a kaleidoscope rather than a wall-paper; a pattern of figures  running and even leaping like the figures in a zoetrope. But even in the  groups where there was no hustle there was often something of  homelessness. I do not mean merely that they were not dining at home;  but rather that they were not at home even when dining, and dining at  their favourite hotel. They would frequently start up and dart from the  room at a summons from the telephone. It may have been fanciful, but I  could not help feeling a breath of home, as from a flap or flutter of  St. George's Cross, when I first sat down in a Canadian hostelry, and  read the announcement that no such telephonic or other summonses were  allowed in the dining-room. It may have been a coincidence, and there  may be American hotels with this merciful proviso and Canadian hotels  without it; but the thing was symbolic even if it was not evidential. I  felt as if I stood indeed upon English soil, in a place where people  liked to have their meals in peace.    The process of the summons is called 'paging,' and consists of sending a  little boy with a large voice through all the halls and corridors of the  building, making them resound with a name. The custom is common, of  course, in clubs and hotels even in England; but in England it is a mere  whisper compared with the wail with which the American page repeats the  formula of 'Calling Mr. So and So.' I remember a particularly crowded  _parterre_ in the somewhat smoky and oppressive atmosphere of Pittsburg,  through which wandered a youth with a voice the like of which I have  never heard in the land of the living, a voice like the cry of a lost  spirit, saying again and again for ever, 'Carling Mr. Anderson.' One  felt that he never would find Mr. Anderson. Perhaps there never had been  any Mr. Anderson to be found. Perhaps he and every one else wandered in  an abyss of bottomless scepticism; and he was but the victim of one out  of numberless nightmares of eternity, as he wandered a shadow with  shadows and wailed by impassable streams. This is not exactly my  philosophy, but I feel sure it was his. And it is a mood that may  frequently visit the mind in the centres of highly active and successful  industrial civilisation.    Such are the first idle impressions of the great American hotel, gained  by sitting for the first time in its gallery and gazing on its drifting  crowds with thoughts equally drifting. The first impression is of  something enormous and rather unnatural, an impression that is gradually  tempered by experience of the kindliness and even the tameness of so  much of that social order. But I should not be recording the sensations  with sincerity, if I did not touch in passing the note of something  unearthly about that vast system to an insular traveller who sees it for  the first time. It is as if he were wandering in another world among the  fixed stars; or worse still, in an ideal Utopia of the future.    Yet I am not certain; and perhaps the best of all news is that nothing  is really new. I sometimes have a fancy that many of these new things in  new countries are but the resurrections of old things which have been  wickedly killed or stupidly stunted in old countries. I have looked over  the sea of little tables in some light and airy open-air cafe; and my  thoughts have gone back to the plain wooden bench and wooden table that  stands solitary and weather-stained outside so many neglected English  inns. We talk of experimenting in the French cafe, as of some fresh and  almost impudent innovation. But our fathers had the French cafe, in the  sense of the free-and-easy table in the sun and air. The only difference  was that French democracy was allowed to develop its cafe, or multiply  its tables, while English plutocracy prevented any such popular growth.  Perhaps there are other examples of old types and patterns, lost in the  old oligarchy and saved in the new democracies. I am haunted with a hint  that the new structures are not so very new; and that they remind me of  something very old. As I look from the balcony floor the crowds seem to  float away and the colours to soften and grow pale, and I know I am in  one of the simplest and most ancestral of human habitations. I am  looking down from the old wooden gallery upon the courtyard of an inn.  This new architectural model, which I have described, is after all one  of the oldest European models, now neglected in Europe and especially in  England. It was the theatre in which were enacted innumerable picaresque  comedies and romantic plays, with figures ranging from Sancho Panza to  Sam Weller. It served as the apparatus, like some gigantic toy set up in  bricks and timber, for the ancient and perhaps eternal game of tennis.  The very terms of the original game were taken from the inn courtyard,  and the players scored accordingly as they hit the buttery-hatch or the  roof. Singular speculations hover in my mind as the scene darkens and  the quadrangle below begins to empty in the last hours of night. Some  day perhaps this huge structure will be found standing in a solitude  like a skeleton; and it will be the skeleton of the Spotted Dog or the  Blue Boar. It will wither and decay until it is worthy at last to be a  tavern. I do not know whether men will play tennis on its ground floor,  with various scores and prizes for hitting the electric fan, or the  lift, or the head waiter. Perhaps the very words will only remain as  part of some such rustic game. Perhaps the electric fan will no longer  be electric and the elevator will no longer elevate, and the waiter will  only wait to be hit. But at least it is only by the decay of modern  plutocracy, which seems already to have begun, that the secret of the  structure even of this plutocratic palace can stand revealed. And after  long years, when its lights are extinguished and only the long shadows  inhabit its halls and vestibules, there may come a new noise like  thunder; of D'Artagnan knocking at the door.          _A Meditation in Broadway_      When I had looked at the lights of Broadway by night, I made to my  American friends an innocent remark that seemed for some reason to amuse  them. I had looked, not without joy, at that long kaleidoscope of  coloured lights arranged in large letters and sprawling trade-marks,  advertising everything, from pork to pianos, through the agency of the  two most vivid and most mystical of the gifts of God; colour and fire. I  said to them, in my simplicity, 'What a glorious garden of wonders this  would be, to any one who was lucky enough to be unable to read.'    Here it is but a text for a further suggestion. But let us suppose that  there does walk down this flaming avenue a peasant, of the sort called  scornfully an illiterate peasant; by those who think that insisting on  people reading and writing is the best way to keep out the spies who  read in all languages and the forgers who write in all hands. On this  principle indeed, a peasant merely acquainted with things of little  practical use to mankind, such as ploughing, cutting wood, or growing  vegetables, would very probably be excluded; and it is not for us to  criticise from the outside the philosophy of those who would keep out  the farmer and let in the forger. But let us suppose, if only for the  sake of argument, that the peasant is walking under the artificial suns  and stars of this tremendous thoroughfare; that he has escaped to the  land of liberty upon some general rumour and romance of the story of  its liberation, but without being yet able to understand the arbitrary  signs of its alphabet. The soul of such a man would surely soar higher  than the sky-scrapers, and embrace a brotherhood broader than Broadway.  Realising that he had arrived on an evening of exceptional festivity,  worthy to be blazoned with all this burning heraldry, he would please  himself by guessing what great proclamation or principle of the Republic  hung in the sky like a constellation or rippled across the street like a  comet. He would be shrewd enough to guess that the three festoons  fringed with fiery words of somewhat similar pattern stood for  'Government of the People, For the People, By the People'; for it must  obviously be that, unless it were 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.' His  shrewdness would perhaps be a little shaken if he knew that the triad  stood for 'Tang Tonic To-day; Tang Tonic To-morrow; Tang Tonic All the  Time.' He will soon identify a restless ribbon of red lettering, red hot  and rebellious, as the saying, 'Give me liberty or give me death.' He  will fail to identify it as the equally famous saying, 'Skyoline Has  Gout Beaten to a Frazzle.' Therefore it was that I desired the peasant  to walk down that grove of fiery trees, under all that golden foliage,  and fruits like monstrous jewels, as innocent as Adam before the Fall.  He would see sights almost as fine as the flaming sword or the purple  and"]]]
