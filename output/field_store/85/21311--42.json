Ich, _Johannes Carl Hermann Weiß_, bin geboren am 5. Januar 1887 zu  Alt-Anhalt im Kreise Pleß, Ober-Schlesien als Sohn des evangelischen  Pastors _Carl Weiß_ und seiner Frau _Elisabeth_, geb. _Natorp_. In  meinem 12. Lebensjahr, 1898 kam ich auf das Königliche humanistische  Gymnasium in Marburg a. Lahn, 1899 auf das Königliche Gymnasium in  Bunzlau in Schlesien, 1904 auf das Königliche Gymnasium in Essen  a. d. Ruhr, wo ich Ostern 1907 das Reifezeugnis erhielt. Ich wählte das  Studium der Medizin und studierte abwechselnd auf den Universitäten Jena  und Greifswald. Nach fünf Semestern bestand ich im Jahre 1909 die  ärztliche Vorprüfung in Jena, nach weiteren fünf Semestern im Juni 1912  das medizinische Staatsexamen vor der ärztlichen Prüfungskommission in  Greifswald. Das praktische Jahr absolvierte ich am Hygienischen Institut  in Greifswald, an der Provinzial-Hebammenlehranstalt in Paderborn, dem  Städtischen Krankenhaus in Hamm i. Westf. und dem Friedrich Krupp'schen  Krankenhaus in Essen-Ruhr.

You see, I support my mother.\" Jackson threw back his head  proudly.    \"You? You support yourself and your mother?\" repeated Peter  incredulously.    \"Sure I do! Why not?\"    \"But you--why, you are not much older than I am!\"    \"I'm sixteen. Mother and I get on very well on what I earn, even though  it isn't much. Don't you have anybody to take care of?\"    \"No.\"    Jackson regarded Peter with astonishment.    \"I should think you would be rich as a lord if you have all your money  to yourself!\" he exclaimed. \"What on earth do you find to do with it?\"    Once--and the time was not far passed, either--Peter would have laughed  at the naive question; now he answered gravely:    \"Oh, I am saving some of it.\"    \"That's right. I can't save a cent at present, but some time I hope to  get a better salary and then I shall be able to. Now let's go over to  the other end of the room and see where they are putting the skins to  soak in those big vats of water to get out the salt and dirt. That's the  first thing they do after the skins are sent into the beamhouse. You  remember how stiff and hard the dry skins were when you unloaded them.  Well, they are put into the great revolving wooden drums that you see  overhead and are worked about in borax and water until they become soft.  They are washed, too. Then after all the skins have been washed and  softened they are thrown into lime and are left there until the fibre  swells and the hair is loosened. The men you see with rubber gloves on  are the limers. If they did not wear gloves they would get their hands  burned and raw, for the lime and the chemicals used in the tan often  make the hands and arms very sore.\"    \"But I don't see that the skins that are tossed into the lime pits come  out with the hair off,\" objected Peter.    \"Bless your heart--the lime does not take the hair off. The men who  unhair them have to do that. They lay the wet skins out on boards and  with sharp knives pull and scrape off all the white hair.\"    \"Why don't they take off the brown or black hair as well?\"    \"Because only the white hair is removed by hand. That is kept separate  and after being dried is sold to dealers for a good price. The colored  hair is taken off by machinery and is sold too, but it is not so  valuable.\"    \"I suppose plasterers can use hair like that,\" speculated Peter.    \"Yes, and upholsterers,\" added Jackson.    Peter smiled.    \"Carmachel told me nothing in a tannery was wasted,\" he said. \"I was  surprised to find that even the lumps of fat and bits of flesh adhering  to the skins, together with the parings that came off when the calfskins  were trimmed down to an even thickness, were disposed of for glue stock  or fertilizer.\"    \"Every scrap of stuff is used, I can tell you!\" assented Jackson.  \"Calfskin, you know, is never split; it is not heavy enough for that.  Besides it is more nearly uniform in weight than a skin like a bull's  hide, for instance, which is very much heavier about the head. No,  calfskin is fairly even and therefore, while wet, is just put between  rollers where a thin, sharp blade shaves from the flesh side any part of  it that is thicker than any other. It comes out of equal thickness all  over. Do you understand?\"    Peter nodded.    \"And now have you this beamhouse process straight in your head so we can  go on?\"    Jackson held up his hand and began to check off the successive steps on  his fingers:    \"The skins are washed until the dirt and salt are out; they are worked  in paddle-wheels, if necessary, until soft; they are limed; unhaired;  and bated, or puered. By puering I mean that they are put through a  liquid that takes out all the lime; if the lime is not carefully soaked  out the skins will be burned and hard and cannot be tanned properly.  After the puering the short-hairers remove any remaining hairs; the  skins are thoroughly washed again, and at last are ready for tanning.\"    \"How are they tanned?\"    \"Why, by putting them into paddle-wheels filled with the tanning  solution where they revolve as many as seven or eight hours. This  solution is then changed for a weaker one, and they revolve again for a  couple of hours more. Some skins are tanned in a mixture of chemicals  which we buy all prepared; we call those chrome tanned. Others are  soaked in a vegetable tan of hemlock, oak, chestnut, palmetto roots,  gambier, or quebracho.\"    \"Or what?\"    \"Quebracho!\" Jackson rolled out the long word with a gusto. \"Quebracho  is a tree something like the lignum-vitae and grows in South America. The  hardened gum comes in barrels and looks like rosin; sometimes, instead  of being hard, it is shipped in a liquid state in big tank cars. There  is about fifteen per cent. of tannin in quebracho and at the tanneries  it can be diluted, of course, to any strength desired. We use it  altogether here instead of using other vegetable tans.\"    \"But it says in my geography that every one uses oak or hemlock bark,\"  objected Peter, sceptically.    \"Well, the Coddington Company doesn't. Bryant says we tan so much  leather here that there would be no way of disposing of the quantities  of bark left after the tannin had been extracted from it. Besides bark  is scarce and expensive; then, too, it takes a car-load of bark to get  even a decent amount of tannin and the freighting adds to the cost.  Quebracho can be shipped by water and is therefore more economical, and  for the varieties of leather we tan here it answers the purpose as well.  It is lots of work to get the tannin out of oak or hemlock bark. The  bark has to be ground up and put in a leaching-kettle full of water;  after it has boiled the liquid is drained off and the tannin extracted.  Using quebracho is a much simpler method. Of course we use oak and  hemlock bark, though, in the sole leather tanneries over at Elmwood.\"    Peter regarded Jackson intently.    \"How did you come to know so much about all this business?\" he asked at  last.    \"Oh, I don't know much,\" was the modest answer. \"I just wanted to learn  what I could while I had the chance. You can't help being curious when  you work so long in one room. Bryant saw I was interested and he's  explained all the things I wanted to find out.\"    \"Then maybe you'll pass on some more of your information,\" laughed  Peter, \"and tell me why some of the skins are tanned in quebracho and  some in chrome.\"    \"As I told you,\" repeated Jackson good-naturedly, \"quebracho is a  vegetable tan and chrome a chemical tan. The effect of each of these  processes on the skins is different; so the process used depends on what  sort of leather is wanted. At many tanneries chrome is used almost  entirely for tanning calfskins because the process is so much quicker;  chrome takes but about nine hours while quebracho tanning takes two  weeks or thereabouts.\"    \"I see. And after the tanning?\"    \"The skins are inspected while wet and sorted for stock; they are then  stamped with a letter or number so they can be identified; they are  fat-liquored, and are dyed.\"    \"What is fat-liquored?\"    \"Fat-liquored means working the skins about in a mixture of soap and oil  until they absorb these softening ingredients and become pliable. All  leather, whether chrome or vegetable tanned, has to go through this  process. The liquid is put into paddle-wheels just as the tanning  mixture is. The dyeing is done in paddle-wheels too, and some kinds of  leather have in addition a coat of dye rubbed into them by hand. It  gives them a better surface.\"    \"What is your work, Jackson?\" asked Peter.    \"Oh, I've done about everything there is to do in a beamhouse. Just now  I am inspecting and sorting the skins after they are tanned.\"    \"What is Mr. Bryant going to set me at?\"    \"I don't know. You will have to ask him. But no matter what he gives you  to do you must not be discouraged, Strong. You were lucky to get any job  at all in the tannery. They have turned away lots of boys your age--they  do it every day.\"    Peter bit his lip to keep from smiling.    \"I suppose I ought to consider myself lucky,\" replied he.    \"Well, aren't you? To be young, and well, and to know that if you do  your best you have a chance to work up to something better? I think  it's great! I intend to work up. Some day I may be a partner in  Coddingtons'--who knows! Then I'll dress my mother in silk every day in  the week and I'll buy an automobile. I'd like to ride in one of those  things just once. Did you ever?\"    \"Yes,\" admitted Peter cautiously.    \"Honest? Wasn't it bully? Where did you go?\"    But Peter was spared the difficult task of replying. Instead, Bryant  summoned him, and he was given a wheel-barrow filled with wet skins  which were to be carried from the soaking vats to the lime pits. All the  rest of the morning back and forth he trudged wheeling load after load.  It was stupid, dirty work, and he was glad when the noon whistle blew.    \"Let's eat our luncheon together, Strong,\" said Jackson, \"that  is--unless you have somebody else you want to lunch with.\"    Peter assented only too gladly. It was far pleasanter to have a boy his  own age to speak to than to eat by himself. Besides he liked Jackson.    But even in the fresh breeze that swept the open field, even while  playing ball, even at home after a hot bath and clean clothing, Peter  could still scent the odor of the beamhouse. It was days before he  became accustomed to it and could feel, with Nat Jackson, that he was a  lucky boy to have a \"job.\"          [Illustration]    CHAPTER IV    PETER'S MAIDEN SPEECH      Peter had been three weeks in the beamhouse and had in that time proved  himself so useful that his pay had been raised from six to six dollars  and a half a week. Very proud he was of his financial good fortune. With  few demands in the way of clothing he was now able to lay aside quite a  little sum toward the motorcycle he so much desired.
