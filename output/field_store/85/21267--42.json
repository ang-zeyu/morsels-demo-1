[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"ceased to be thus received, had continued to be repeated, in a shape  more or less altered, for mere amusement. If we may venture to affirm  this and to generalize from such cases, this is the way in which  _maerchen_ have arisen.    But sagas are not only perhaps the most ancient of tales, they are  certainly the most persistent. By their attachment to places and to  persons, a religious sanction is frequently given to them, a local and  national pride is commonly felt in preserving them. Thus they are  remembered when nursery tales are forgotten; they are more easily  communicated to strangers; they find their way into literature and so  are rendered imperishable.    Fairy Tales of both these classes are compounded of incidents which are  the common property of many nations, and not a few whereof are known all  over the habitable globe. In some instances the whole plot, a more or  less intricate one, is found among races the most diverse in  civilization and character. Where the plot is intricate, or contains  elements of a kind unlikely to have originated independently, we may be  justified in suspecting diffusion from one centre. Then it is that the  history and circumstances of a nation become important factors in the  inquiry; and upon the purity of blood and the isolation from  neighbouring races may depend our decision as to the original or  derivative character of such a tradition. Sometimes the passage of a  story from one country to another can be proved by literary evidence.  This is markedly the case with Apologues and Facetious Tales, two  classes of traditions which do not come within the purview of the  present work. But the story has then passed beyond the traditional  stage, or else such proof could not be given. In tracing the history of  a folk-tale which has entered into literature, the problem is to  ascertain how far the literary variations we meet with may have been  influenced by pre-existing traditional tales formed upon similar lines.  In general, however, it may be safely said of Fairy Tales (with which we  are more immediately concerned) that the argument in favour of their  propagation from a single centre lacks support. The incidents of which  they are composed are based upon ideas not peculiar to any one people,  ideas familiar to savages everywhere, and only slowly modified and  transformed as savagery gives way to barbarism, and barbarism to modern  civilization and scientific knowledge of the material phenomena of the  universe. The ideas referred to are expressed by races in the lower  culture both in belief and in custom. And many of the tales which now  amuse our children appear to have grown out of myths believed in the  most matter-of-fact way by our remote forefathers; while others enshrine  relics of long-forgotten customs and modes of tribal organization.    There is one habit of thought familiar to savage tribes that to us,  trained through long centuries of progressive knowledge, seems in the  highest degree absurd and even incomprehensible. As a matter of  every-day practice we cannot, if we would, go back to that infantine  state of mind which regards not only our fellow men and women, but all  objects animate and inanimate around us, as instinct with a  consciousness, a personality akin to our own. This, however, is the  savage philosophy of things. To a large proportion of human beings at  the present day beasts and birds, trees and plants, the sea, the  mountains, the wind, the sun, the moon, the clouds and the stars, day  and night, the heaven and the earth, are alive and possessed of the  passions and the cunning and the will they feel within themselves. The  only difference is that these things are vastly cleverer and more  powerful than men. Hence they are to be dreaded, to be appeased--if  possible, to be outwitted--even, sometimes, to be punished. We may  observe this childish habit of thought in our nurseries to-day when one  of our little ones accidentally runs against the table, and forthwith  turns round to beat the senseless wood as if it had voluntarily and  maliciously caused his pain; or when another, looking wistfully out of  window, adjures the rain in the old rhyme:        \"Rain, rain, go away!      Come again another day!\"    Poets, too, and orators in their loftiest moods revert to language and  modes of expression which have no meaning apart from this belief in the  conscious animation of every object in the world. They may move us for  the moment by their utterances; but we never take their raptures  literally. To the savage, however, it is no figure of speech to call  upon the sun to behold some great deed, or to declare that the moon  hides her face; to assert that the ocean smiles, or that the river  swells with rage, and overwhelms a wayfarer who is crossing it, or an  unsuspecting village on its banks. These phrases for him fit the facts  of nature as closely as those which record that the man eats or the boy  runs. Nay, what would seem incredible to him would be to deny that the  sun can see or the moon hide her face, the ocean smile or the river  become enraged. Conscious personality and human emotions are visible to  him everywhere and in all things.    It matters not to the savage that human form and speech are absent.  These are not necessary, or, if they are, they can be assumed either at  will or under certain conditions. For one of the consequences, or at  least one of the accompaniments, of this stage of thought is the belief  in change of form without loss of individual identity. The bear whom the  savage meets in the woods is too cunning to appear and do battle with  him as a man; but he could if he chose. The stars were once men and  women. Sun and moon, the wind and the waters, perform all the functions  of living beings: they speak, they eat, they marry and have children.  Rocks and trees are not always as immovable as they appear: sometimes  they are to be seen as beasts or men, whose shapes they still, it may  be, dimly retain.    It follows that peoples in this stage of thought cannot have, in theory  at all events, the repugnance to a sexual union between man and the  lower animals with which religious training and the growth of  civilization have impressed all the higher races. Such peoples admit  the possibility of a marriage wherein one party may be human and the  other an animal of a different species, or even a tree or plant. If they  do not regard it as an event which can take place in their own time and  neighbourhood, it does not seem entirely incredible as an event of the  past; and sometimes customs are preserved on into a higher degree of  culture--such as that of wedding, for special purposes, a man to a  tree--unmistakably bespeaking former, if not present, beliefs. Moreover,  tribes in the stage of thought here described, hold themselves to be  actually descended from material objects often the most diverse from  human form. These are not only animals (beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles,  and even insects) or vegetables, but occasionally the sun, the sea, the  earth, and other things unendowed with life. Such mythic ancestors are  worshipped as divine. This superstition is called _Totemism_, and the  mythic ancestor is known as the _Totem_. As a people passes gradually  into a higher stage of culture, greater stress is constantly laid on the  human qualities of the Totem, until it becomes at length an  anthropomorphic god. To such deity the object previously reverenced as a  Totem is attached, and a new and modified legend grows up to account for  the connection.    The belief in metamorphosis involves opinions on the subject of death  which are worth a moment's pause. Death is a problem to all men, to the  savage as to the most civilized. Least of any can the savage look upon  it as extinction. He emphatically believes that he has something within  him that survives the dissolution of his outward frame. This is his  spirit, the seat of his consciousness, his real self. As he himself has  a spirit, so every object in the world has a spirit. He peoples the  universe, as he knows it, with spirits akin to his own. It is to their  spirits that all the varied objects around him, all the phenomena  observable by day or by night, owe the consciousness, the personality, I  have already tried to describe. These spirits are separable from the  material form with which they are clad. When the savage sleeps, his  spirit goes forth upon various adventures. These adventures he remembers  as dreams; but they are as veritable as his waking deeds; and he awakes  when his spirit returns to him. In his dreams he sees his friends, his  foes; he kills imaginary bears and venison. He knows therefore that  other men's spirits travel while their bodies sleep and undergo  adventures like his own, and in company often with his spirit. He knows  that the spirits of wild animals range abroad and encounter his spirit.  What is death but the spirit going forth to return no more? Rocks and  rivers perhaps cannot die, or at least their life immeasurably exceeds  that of men. But the trees of the forest may, for he can cut them down  and burn them. Yet, inasmuch as it is the nature of a body to have an  indwelling spirit, death--the permanent severing of body and  spirit--cannot occur naturally: it must be due to the machination of  some enemy, by violence, by poison, or by sorcery.    The spirit that has gone forth for ever is not, by quitting its bodily  tenement, deprived of power offensive and defensive. It is frequently  impelled by hostile motives to injure those yet in the flesh; and it  must, therefore, be appeased, or deceived, or driven away. This is the  end and aim of funeral rites: this is the meaning of many periodical  ceremonies in which the whole tribe takes part. For the same reason,  when the hunter slays a powerful animal, he apologizes and lays the  blame on his arrows or his spear, or on some one else.

As that  period has already expired, a like sum has again to be secured. It  may be added that this fund does not suffice to meet the expenses  incurred by the daily choral Evensong, which was started in June,  1899. The contributions received for this purpose (\"The Daily Choral  Service Fund\") have hitherto been just sufficient, and it is hoped  that by help from a somewhat wider circle of those interested in the  efficiency of the Collegiate Church, this service, which has been  increasingly appreciated, will not have to be discontinued. The  Treasurers are the Bishop of Southwark and the Precentor.    A Collegiate House has also been purchased, in which the unmarried  members of the Chapter may reside as well as the Collegiate body. The  latter consists of clergy in Priest's Orders, who undertake to place  themselves at the disposal of the Bishop for work in connection with  the diocese or Collegiate Church.    A valuable addition has been made to the Collegiate buildings in view  of the elevation of the church to the rank of a cathedral. The old  church of St. Thomas, adjoining the Collegiate House, which would have  been pulled down, has been saved and turned into a Chapter House. It  serves for diocesan meetings, and will hold about 400 people. It is  connected by a corridor with the Foster Hall of the Collegiate House,  and thus forms a convenient series of rooms for large or small  conferences. It is a plain red brick building, with stone dressings,  at the west end of which is a three-storied tower of the same  materials. The ground floor of the tower forms the porch. Entering by  this way we find ourselves in a lofty oblong hall, about 60 feet by  30, with a gallery on the north and west, and the altar-piece before  us at the east end, shut in by a wooden partition, in front of which  stand two chairs--one for the Bishop, the other for his Suffragan. The  history of the present building dates from 1702, when it was erected  on a monastic foundation, the funds being provided by a grant of  L3,000--out of the coal dues, pursuant to a Statute of William and  Mary, the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital providing the balance.  The date is given on the central panel of the old pulpit, which is  preserved, in reduced form, as a reading desk. Both this and the  altar-piece are made of oak. The altar-piece is rather a fine specimen  of wood-carving in the Corinthian style, with the usual tables for the  Creed, etc. (now blank) between two pilasters, surmounted by the arms  of George I. The old pews were demolished, as no longer required,  when the church was transformed into a Chapter House, but the fine  grained oak of which they were made was turned to account for doors  and panelling. Below all this there is a crypt, of much earlier date,  which now answers the purpose of a refreshment department on special  occasions.       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE CHAPTER HOUSE.     _Formerly the Church of St. Thomas._]    Behind the eastern wall a smaller hall has been erected between the  Chapter House and the adjacent Collegiate House. This serves the  double purpose of a vestibule and a place for smaller gatherings. The  generous donor wishes to remain anonymous, but is partially revealed  in a tablet over the fireplace, which says:        \"As a Thank-offering for many blessings during a long life, a      merchant of the City of London constructed this Meeting Hall,      and munificently contributed to the purchase of the Collegiate      House of St. Saviour, Southwark, Sep 4, 1898,\" surmounted by      his arms and the legend \"Watch and be ready.\"    A library, already consisting of several hundred volumes, is being  formed in the Chapter House, for the use of the clergy and licensed  Readers of the diocese--in addition to the Collegiate Library proper,  which at present is kept in the same place.    With all its advantages, the present Chapter House is acknowledged to  be an unworthy representative of the original, as being at an  inconvenient distance from the Cathedral, and out of character with it  in design. Unfortunately no trace of the old house, or of its exact  site, is left to us. The Cloisters and the College, or Priory, are  known to have been on the north, the Prior's residence at the  north-west angle of the Cloisters, and the Refectory at the north-east  end. The whole formed a splendid group of buildings and covered a  large area, bounded on the north by the Thames; on the south by the  church and churchyard; on the east by the \"Bishop's Chapel,\" with a  wall beyond it (at about the distance of the present roadway); and on  the west by a small creek (St. Saviour's dock), beyond which lay the  Bishop of Winchester's palace and garden.    By an instrument dated 15th July, 1545, the whole of the Priory lands  were made over to Sir Anthony Browne, Knt., in the following  comprehensive terms: \"Totum situm septum circuitum ambitum et  precinctum nuper Monasterii sive Prioratus beate Mariae Overey in Com.  Surr.\"    The work of demolition dates from that time, and the old buildings  have gradually disappeared to make way for the modern wharves and  warehouses which have since occupied the ground. The finishing strokes  were put to the destruction during the first half of 1835, when Mr.  E.J. Carlos, the archaeologist, visited the ruins, and describes them  as then showing \"scarcely one stone upon another.\" They had previously  been visited by another antiquary (Mr. John Carter) in 1797 and 1808,  when there was a little more to be seen. Both gentlemen gave their  experience in the pages of the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" with a  conjectural description of the group of buildings as it had been,  contrasted with the desolation they then witnessed. (_See_ the  \"Gentleman's Magazine\" for 1808 and 1835.)       [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE EAST.     _Reproduced from a drawing by Mr. Hedley Fitton, by permission     of the \"Daily Chronicle.\"_]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] See a paper read before the Society of Antiquaries, in 1833, by Mr.  A.J. Kempe.    [2] Burnham-Overy, in Norfolk, and Barton-Overy, in Leicestershire,  show that the suffix is not peculiar to St. Mary's, Southwark.    [3] It may be well to explain that a \"Collegiate Church\" takes its name  from the _Collegium_, or collected body of priests, attached to it, who  were called \"Secular Canons\" in distinction from the \"Regular Canons\"  of a monastery. The latter were monks who had been admitted to Holy  Orders, but still continued in obedience to the rule (_regulus_) of the  foundation to which they belonged. The Seculars were more or less like  our parochial clergy in that they were subject to no such regulation,  lived and moved without restraint among the people, and in early days  were not infrequently married. Until the time of Pope Gregory VII  (1073-1085), the celibacy of the extra-monastic clergy was not at all  generally insisted on. Even after the twelfth century, when greater  strictness had been enforced by the first and second Lateran Councils,  the marriage of the secular clergy was frequently connived at by their  superiors, who even tolerated a system of concubinage which they were  unable to prevent--_propter duritiem cordis_--by which a law of nature  was provided for, in defiance of the law ecclesiastical. The question  was finally settled by the Council of Trent in 1563, since when the  celibate rule has generally been strictly observed in the Roman Church.  The absence of such a rule in the Church of England is, of course, due  to the Reformation.    With very few exceptions the English \"Colleges\" were suppressed by an  Act of 1545. The name seems to have clung to St. Saviour's through all  its subsequent changes, rather by old association than as having any  practical value, till the collegiate character, as well as the title,  was formally restored to it in 1897 by Dr. Talbot, then Bishop of  Rochester.    [4] The dedication of the hospital was altered to \"St.  Thomas-the-Apostle,\" in 1540, when the official title of the church was  changed to St. Saviour. To make way for the line of railway between  London Bridge and Charing Cross, a wing of the hospital had to be  pulled down, and the whole was transferred to the Albert Embankment,  where the new buildings were opened by Her late Majesty Queen Victoria  in 1871.    [5] In 1900 the number of churchwardens was reduced to five, of whom  two only discharge ecclesiastical duties.    [6] That the vestrymen were not indifferent to creature comforts is  shown by an entry in their records for 5th April, 1569, from which it  appears that it was their wont to eat a calf's head pie in the vestry  in celebration of Easter. The luxury was supplemented in 1600-1607 by  the gift of a buck and 20_s._ from Sir Edward Dyer, to provide an  entertainment for the vestrymen and their wives at the same season. On  the other hand, they were not allowed to have it all their own way, for  a resolution of 25th April, 1569, prohibits more than one of them from  speaking at once, under a penalty of 4_d._, and imposes a fine of 2_s._  6_d._ for irreverent behaviour in the vestry. They were also required  to wear their gowns in the vestry, and to attend the funeral of any of  their _confreres_, or their wives (i"]]]
