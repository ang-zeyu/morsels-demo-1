Thus, it was  improbable that captivity could produce the effect I wished to explain.  At the same time, as it was essential to neglect nothing in a subject so  new, I wished to ascertain whether it was owing to the length of  confinement, or to retarded fecundation.    Investigating this was no easy matter. To discover whether captivity,  and not retarded fecundation, vitiated the ovaries, it was necessary to  allow a female to receive the approaches of a male, and also to keep her  imprisoned. Now this could not be, for bees never copulate in hives. On  the same account, it was impossible to retard the copulation of a queen  without keeping her in confinement. I was long embarrassed by the  difficulty. At length, I contrived an apparatus, which, though  imperfect, nearly fulfilled my purpose.    I put a queen, at the moment of her last metamorphosis, into a hive well  stored, and sufficiently provided with workers and males; the entrance  was contracted so as to prevent her exit, but allowed free passage to  the workers. I also made another opening for the queen, and adapted a  glass tube to it, communicating with a cubical glass box eight feet  high. Hither the queen could at all times come and fly about, enjoying a  purer air than was to be found within the hive; but she could not be  fecundated; for though the males flew about within the same bounds, the  space was too limited to admit of any union between them. By the  experiments related in my first letter, copulation takes place high in  the air only: therefore, in this apparatus, I found the advantage of  retarding fecundation, while the liberty the queen now had, did not  render her situation too remote from the natural state. I attended to  the experiment fifteen days. Every fine morning, the young captive left  her hive; she traversed her glass prison, and flew much about, and with  great facility. She laid none during this interval, for she had not  united with a male. On the sixteenth day, I set her at liberty: she left  the hive, rose aloft in the air, and soon returned with full evidence of  impregnation. In two days, she laid, first the eggs of workers, and  afterwards as many as the most fertile queens.    It thence followed, 1. That captivity did not alter the organs of  queens. 2. When fecundation took place within the first sixteen days,  she produced both species of eggs.    This was an important experiment. It rendered my labours much more  simple, by clearly pointing out the method to be pursued: it absolutely  precluded the supposed influence of captivity; and left nothing for  investigation but the consequences of retarded fecundation.    With this view, I repeated the experiment; but, instead of giving the  virgin queen liberty on the sixteenth day, I retained her until the  twenty-first. She departed, rose high in the air, was fecundated, and  returned. Thirty-six hours afterwards, she began to lay: but it was the  eggs of males only, and, although very fruitful afterwards, she laid no  other kind.    I occupied myself the remainder of 1787, and the two subsequent years,  with experiments on retarded fecundation, and had constantly the same  results. It is undoubted, therefore, that when the copulation of queens  is retarded beyond the twentieth day, only an imperfect impregnation is  operated: instead of laying the eggs of workers and males equally, they  will lay none but those of males.    I do not aspire to the honour of explaining this singular fact. When the  course of my experiments led me to observe that some queens laid only  the eggs of drones, it was natural to investigate the proximate cause of  such a singularity; and I ascertained that it arose from retarded  fecundation. My evidence is demonstrative, for I can always prevent  queens from laying the eggs of workers, by retarding their fecundation  until the twenty-second or twenty-third day. But, what is the remote  cause of this peculiarity; or, in other words, why does the delay of  impregnation render queens incapable of laying the eggs of workers? This  is a problem on which analogy throws no light: nor in all physiology am  I acquainted with any fact that bears the smallest similarity.    The problem becomes still more difficult by reflecting on the natural  state of things, that is when fecundation has not been delayed. The  queen then lays the eggs of workers forty-six hours after copulation,  and continues for the subsequent eleven months to lay these alone: and  it is only after this period that a considerable and uninterrupted  laying of the eggs of drones commences. When, on the contrary,  impregnation is retarded after the twentieth day, the queen begins, from  the forty-sixth hour, to lay the eggs of males, and no other kind during  her whole life. As, in the natural state, she lays the eggs of workers  only, during the first eleven months, it is clear that these, and the  male eggs, are not indiscriminately mixed in the oviducts. Undoubtedly  they occupy a situation corresponding to the principles that regulate  laying: the eggs of workers are first, and those of drones behind them.  Farther, it appears that the queen can lay no male eggs until those of  workers, occupying the first place in the oviducts, are discharged. Why,  then, is this order inverted by retarded copulation? How does it happen  that all the workers eggs which the queen ought to lay, if fecundation  was in due time, now wither and disappear, yet do not, impede the  passage of the eggs of drones, which occupy only the second place in the  ovaries. Nor is this all. I have satisfied myself that a single  copulation is sufficient to impregnate the whole eggs that a queen will  lay in the course of at least two years. I have even reason to think,  that a single copulation will impregnate all the eggs that she will lay  during her whole life: but I want absolute proof for more than two  years. This, which is truly a very singular fact in itself, renders the  influence of retarded fecundation still more difficult to be accounted  for. Since a single copulation suffices, it is clear that the male fluid  acts from the first moment on all the eggs that the queen will lay in  two years. It gives them, according to your principles, that degree of  _animation_ that afterwards effects their successive expansion. Having  received the first impressions of life, they grow, they mature, so to  speak, until the day they are laid: and as the laws of laying are  constant, because the eggs of the first eleven months are always those  of workers, it is evident that those which appear first are also the  eggs that come soonest to maturity. Thus, in the natural state, the  space of eleven months is necessary for the male eggs to acquire that  degree of increment they must have attained when laid. This consequence,  which to me seems immediate, renders the problem insoluble. How can the  eggs, which should grow slowly for eleven months, suddenly acquire their  full expansion in forty-eight hours, when fecundation has been retarded  twenty-one days, and by the effect of this retardation alone? Observe, I  beseech you, that the hypothesis of successive expansion is not  gratuitous; it rests on the principles of sound philosophy. Besides, for  conviction that it is well founded, we have only to look at the figures  given by Swammerdam of the ovaries of the queen bee. There we see eggs  in that part of the oviducts contiguous to the vulva, much farther  advanced, and larger than those contained in the opposite part.  Therefore the difficulty remains in full force: it is an abyss where I  am lost.    The only known fact bearing any relation to that now described, is the  state of certain vegetable seeds, which, although extremely well  preserved, lose the faculty of germination from age. The eggs of workers  may also preserve, only for a very short time, the property of being  fecundated by the seminal fluid; and, after this period, which is about  fifteen or eighteen days, become disorganised to that degree, that they  can no longer be animated by it. I am sensible that the comparison is  very imperfect; besides, it explains nothing, nor does it even put us  on the way of making any new experiments. I shall add but one reflection  more.    Hitherto no other effect has been observed from the retarded  impregnation of animals, but that of rendering them absolutely sterile.  The first instance of a female still preserving the faculty of  engendering males, is presented by the queen bee. But as no fact in  nature is unique, it is most probable that the same peculiarity will  also be found in other animals. An extremely curious object of research  would be to consider insects in this new point of view, I say _insects_,  for I do not conceive that any thing analogous will be found in other  species of animals. The experiments now suggested would necessarily  begin with insects the most analogous to bees; as wasps, humble bees,  mason bees, all species of flies, and the like. Some experiments might  also be made on butterflies; and, perhaps, an animal might be found  whose retarded fecundation would be attended with the same effects as  that of queen bees. Should the animal be larger, dissection will be more  easily accomplished; and we may discover what happens to the eggs when  retarded fecundation prevents their expansion. At least, we might hope  that some fortunate circumstance would lead to solution of the  problem{G}.    Let us now return to my experiments. In May 1789, I took two queens just  when they had undergone the last metamorphosis: one was put in a _leaf  hive_, well provided with honey and wax, and sufficiently inhabited by  workers and males. The other was put into a hive exactly similar, from  which all the drones were removed. The entrances of these hives were  too confined for the passage of the females and drones, but the common  bees enjoyed perfect liberty."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26477"],[0,"Observations on the Florid Song; Or, Sentiments on the Ancient and Modern (#6)"],[1,"singing them out of Tune.    Sec. 17. The Master should know, that though a good Voice put forth with  Ease grows better, yet by too swift a Motion in _Divisions_ it becomes  an indifferent one, and sometimes by the Negligence of the Master, to  the Prejudice of the Scholar, it is changed into a very bad one.    Sec. 18. _Divisions_ and _Shakes_ in a _Siciliana_ are Faults, and  _Glidings_ and _Draggs_ are Beauties.    Sec. 19. The sole and entire Beauty of the _Division_ consists in its being  perfectly in Tune, mark'd, equal, distinct, and quick.    Sec. 20. _Divisions_ have the like Fate with the _Shakes_; both equally  delight in their Place; but if not properly introduced, the too frequent  Repetition of them becomes tedious if not odious.    Sec. 21. After the Scholar has made himself perfect in the _Shake_ and the  _Divisions_, the Master should let him read and pronounce the Words,  free from those gross and ridiculous Errors of Orthography, by which  many deprive one Word of its double Consonant, and add one to another,  in which it is single.[44]    Sec. 22. After having corrected the Pronunciation, let him take Care that  the Words be uttered in such a Manner, without any Affectation that  they be distinctly understood, and no one Syllable be lost; for if they  are not distinguished, the Singer deprives the Hearer of the greatest  Part of that Delight which vocal Musick conveys by Means of the Words.  For, if the Words are not heard so as to be understood, there will be no  great Difference between a human Voice and a Hautboy. This Defect, tho'  one of the greatest, is now-a-days more than common, to the greatest  Disgrace of the Professors and the Profession; and yet they ought to  know, that the Words only give the Preference to a Singer above an  instrumental Performer, admitting them to be of equal Judgment and  Knowledge. Let the modern Master learn to make use of this Advice, for  never was it more necessary than at present.    Sec. 23. Let him exercise the Scholar to be very ready in joining the  Syllables to the Notes, that he may never be at a Loss in doing it.    Sec. 24. Let him forbid the Scholar to take Breath in the Middle of a Word,  because the dividing it in two is an Error against Nature; which must  not be followed, if we would avoid being laugh'd at. In interrupted  Movements, or in long _Divisions_, it is not so rigorously required,  when the one or the other cannot be sung in one Breath. Anciently such  Cautions were not necessary, but for the Learners of the first  Rudiments; now the Abuse, having taken its Rise in the modern Schools,  gathers Strength, and is grown familiar with those who pretend to  Eminence. The Master may correct this Fault, in teaching the Scholar to  manage his Respiration, that he may always be provided with more Breath  than is needful; and may avoid undertaking what, for want of it, he  cannot go through with.    Sec. 25. Let him shew, in all sorts of Compositions, the proper Place where  to take Breath, and without Fatigue; because there are Singers who give  Pain to the Hearer, as if they had an Asthma taking Breath every Moment  with Difficulty, as if they were breathing their last.    Sec. 26. Let the Master create some Emulation in a Scholar that is  negligent, inciting him to study the Lesson of his Companion, which  sometimes goes beyond Genius; because, if instead of one Lesson he hears  two, and the Competition does not discountenance him, he may perhaps  come to learn his Companion's Lesson first, and then his own.    Sec. 27. Let him never suffer the Scholar to hold the Musick-Paper, in  Singing, before his Face, both that the Sound of the Voice may not be  obstructed, and to prevent him from being bashful.    Sec. 28. Let him accustom the Scholar to sing often in presence of Persons  of Distinction, whether from Birth, Quality, or Eminence in the  Profession, that by gradually losing his Fear, he may acquire an  Assurance, but not a Boldness. Assurance leads to a Fortune, and in a  Singer becomes a Merit. On the contrary, the Fearful is most unhappy;  labouring under the Difficulty of fetching Breath, the Voice is always  trembling, and obliged to lose Time at every Note for fear of being  choaked; He gives us Pain, in not being able to shew his Ability in  publick; disgusts the Hearer, and ruins the Compositions in such a  Manner, that they are not known to be what they are. A timorous Singer  is unhappy, like a Prodigal, who is miserably poor.    Sec. 29. Let not the Master neglect to shew him, how great their Error is  who make _Shakes_ or _Divisions_, or take Breath on the _syncopated_ or  _binding_ Notes; and how much better Effect the holding out the Voice  has. The Compositions, instead of losing, acquire thereby greater  Beauty.[45]    Sec. 30. Let the Master instruct him in the _Forte_ and _Piano_, but so as  to use him more to the first than the second, it being easier to make  one sing soft than loud. Experience shews that the _Piano_ is not to be  trusted to, since it is prejudicial though pleasing; and if any one has  a Mind to lose his Voice, let him try it. On this Subject some are of  Opinion, that there is an artificial _Piano_, that can make itself be  heard as much as the _Forte_; but that is only Opinion, which is the  Mother of all Errors. It is not Art which is the Cause that the _Piano_  of a good Singer is heard, but the profound Silence and Attention of the  Audience. For a Proof of this, let any indifferent Singer be silent on  the Stage for a Quarter of a Minute when he should sing, the Audience,  curious to know the Reason of this unexpected Pause, are hush'd in such  a Manner, that if in that Instant he utter one Word with a soft Voice,  it would be heard even by those at the greatest Distance.    Sec. 31. Let the Master remember, that whosoever does not sing to the  utmost Rigour of Time, deserves not the Esteem of the Judicious;  therefore let him take Care, there be no Alteration or Diminution in it,  if he pretends to teach well, and to make an excellent Scholar.    Sec. 32. Though in certain Schools, Books of Church-Musick and of  _Madrigals_ lie buried in Dust, a good Master would wipe it off; for  they are the most effectual Means to make a Scholar ready and sure. If  Singing was not for the most part performed by Memory, as is customary  in these Days, I doubt whether certain Professors could deserve the Name  of Singers of the first Rank.[46]    Sec. 33. Let him encourage the Scholar if he improves; let him mortify him,  without Beating, for Indolence; let him be more rigorous for  Negligences; nor let the Scholar ever end a Lesson without having  profited something.    Sec. 34. An Hour of Application in a Day is not sufficient, even for one of  the quickest Apprehension; the Master therefore should consider how much  more Time is necessary for one that has not the same Quickness, and how  much he is obliged to consult the Capacity of his Scholar. From a  mercenary Teacher this necessary Regard is not to be hoped for; expected  by other Scholars, tired with the Fatigue, and solicited by his  Necessities, he thinks the Month long; looks on his Watch, and goes  away. If he be but poorly paid for his Teaching,--a God-b'wy to him.          CHAP. V.    _Of_ Recitative.      _Recitative_ is of three Kinds, and ought to be taught in three  different Manners.    Sec. 2. The first, being used in Churches, should be sung as becomes the  Sanctity of the Place, which does not admit those wanton Graces of a  lighter Stile; but requires some _Messa di Voce_, many _Appoggiatura's_,  and a noble Majesty throughout. But the Art of expressing it, is not to  be learned, but from the affecting Manner of those who devoutly dedicate  their Voices to the Service of God.    Sec. 3. The second is Theatrical, which being always accompanied with  Action by the Singer, the Master is obliged to teach the Scholar a  certain natural Imitation, which cannot be beautiful, if not expressed  with that Decorum with which Princes speak, or those who know how to  speak to Princes.    Sec. 4. The last, according to the Opinion of the most Judicious, touches  the Heart more than the others, and is called _Recitativo di Camera_.  This requires a more peculiar Skill, by reason of the Words, which  being, for the most part, adapted to move the most violent Passions of  the Soul, oblige the Master to give the Scholar such a lively Impression  of them, that he may seem to be affected with them himself. The Scholar  having finished his Studies, it will be but too[47] easily discovered  if he stands in Need of this Lesson. The vast Delight, which the  Judicious feel, is owing to this particular Excellence, which, without  the Help of the usual Ornaments, produces all this Pleasure from itself;  and, let Truth prevail, where Passion speaks, all _Shakes_, all  _Divisions_ and _Graces_ ought to be silent, leaving it to the sole  Force of a beautiful Expression to persuade.    Sec. 5. The Church _Recitative_ yields more Liberty to the Singer than the  other two, particularly in the final Cadence; provided he makes the  Advantage of it that a Singer should do, and not as a Player on the  Violin.    Sec. 6. The Theatrical leaves it not in our Election to make Use of this  Art, lest we offend in the Narrative, which ought to be natural, unless  in a _Soliloquy_, where it may be in the Stile of Chamber-Musick.    Sec. 7. The third abstains from great part of the Solemnity of the first,  and contents itself with more of the second.    Sec. 8. The Defects and unsufferable Abuses which are heard in  _Recitatives_, and not known to those who commit them, are innumerable.  I will take Notice of several Theatrical ones, that the Master may  correct them.    Sec. 9. There are some who sing _Recitative_ on the Stage like That of the  Church or Chamber; some in a perpetual Chanting, which is insufferable;  some over-do it and make it a Barking; some whisper it,"]]]
