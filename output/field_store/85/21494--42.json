The moon was risen, but the west was still full of  color and light. It faded. There was a pause. Only a bar of dull  red, holding a hint of brown, by where the sun had sunk. And minutes  passed--minutes for me full of silent expectation, while the moonlight  grew a little stronger, a few more silver rays slipped down upon the  ruins. I turned toward the east. And then came that curious crescendo of  color and of light which, in Egypt, succeeds the diminuendo of color  and of light that is the prelude to the pause before the afterglow.  Everything seemed to be in subtle movement, heaving as a breast heaves  with the breath; swelling slightly, as if in an effort to be more, to  attract attention, to gain in significance. Pale things became livid,  holding apparently some under-brightness which partly penetrated its  envelope, but a brightness that was white and almost frightful. Black  things seemed to glow with blackness. The air quivered. Its silence  surely thrilled with sound--with sound that grew ever louder.    In the east I saw an effect. To the west I turned for the cause. The  sunset light was returning. Horus would not permit Tum to reign even  for a few brief moments, and Khuns, the sacred god of the moon, would be  witness of a conflict in that lovely western region of the ocean of the  sky where the bark of the sun had floated away beneath the mountain  rim upon the red-and-orange tides. The afterglow was like an exquisite  spasm, is always like an exquisite spasm, a beautiful, almost desperate  effort ending in the quiet darkness of defeat. And through that  spasmodic effort a world lived for some minutes with a life that seemed  unreal, startling, magical. Color returned to the sky--color ethereal,  trembling as if it knew it ought not to return. Yet it stayed for a  while and even glowed, though it looked always strangely purified,  and full of a crystal coldness. The birds that flew against it were no  longer birds, but dark, moving ornaments, devised surely by a supreme  artist to heighten here and there the beauty of the sky. Everything that  moved against the afterglow--man, woman, child, camel and donkey, dog  and goat, languishing buffalo, and plunging horse--became at once an  ornament, invented, I fancied, by a genius to emphasize, by relieving  it, the color in which the sky was drowned. And Khuns watched serenely,  as if he knew the end. And almost suddenly the miraculous effort failed.  Things again revealed their truth, whether commonplace or not. That pool  of the Nile was no more a red jewel set in a feathery pattern of strange  design, but only water fading from my sight beyond a group of palms. And  that below me was only a camel going homeward, and that a child leading  a bronze-colored sheep with a curly coat, and that a dusty, flat-roofed  hovel, not the fairy home of jinn, or the abode of some magician working  marvels with the sun-rays he had gathered in his net. The air was no  longer thrilling with music. The breast that had heaved with a divine  breath was still as the breast of a corpse.    And Khuns reigned quietly over the plains of Karnak.    Karnak has no distinctive personality. Built under many kings, its ruins  are as complex as were probably once its completed temples, with their  shrines, their towers, their courts, their hypo-style halls. As I  looked down that evening in the moonlight I saw, softened and made more  touching than in day-time, those alluring complexities, brought by the  night and Khuns into a unity that was both tender and superb. Masses of  masonry lay jumbled in shadow and in silver; gigantic walls cast sharply  defined gloom; obelisks pointed significantly to the sky, seeming, as  they always do, to be murmuring a message; huge doorways stood up like  giants unafraid of their loneliness and yet pathetic in it; here was a  watching statue, there one that seemed to sleep, seen from afar. Yonder  Queen Hatshepsu, who wrought wonders at Deir-el-Bahari, and who is more  familiar perhaps as Hatasu, had left there traces, and nearer, to the  right, Rameses III. had made a temple, surely for the birds, so fond  they are of it, so pertinaciously they haunt it. Rameses II., mutilated  and immense, stood on guard before the terrific hall of Seti I.; and  between him and my platform in the air rose the solitary lotus column  that prepares you for the wonder of Seti's hall, which otherwise might  almost overwhelm you--unless you are a Scotch lady in a helmet. And  Khuns had his temple here by the Sphinx of the twelfth Rameses, and  Ptah, who created \"the sun egg and the moon egg,\" and who was said--only  said, alas!--to have established on earth the \"everlasting justice,\" had  his, and still their stones receive the silver moon-rays and wake  the wonder of men. Thothmes III., Thothmes I., Shishak, who smote the  kneeling prisoners and vanquished Jeroboam, Medamut and Mut, Amenhotep  I., and Amenhotep II.--all have left their records or been celebrated at  Karnak. Purposely I mingled them in my mind--did not attempt to put them  in their proper order, or even to disentangle gods and goddesses from  conquerors and kings. In the warm and seductive night Khuns whispered  to me: \"As long ago at Bekhten I exorcised the demon from the suffering  Princess, so now I exorcise from these ruins all spirits but my own.  To-night these ruins shall suggest nothing but majesty, tranquillity,  and beauty. Their records are for Ra, and must be studied by his rays.  In mine they shall speak not to the intellectual, but only to the  emotions and the soul.\"    And presently I went down, and yielding a complete and happy obedience  to Khuns, I wandered along through the stupendous vestiges of past eras,  dead ambitions, vanished glory, and long-outworn belief, and I ignored  eras, ambitions, glory, and belief, and thought only of form, and  height, of the miracle of blackness against silver, and of the pathos  of statues whose ever-open eyes at night, when one is near them, suggest  the working of some evil spell, perpetual watchfulness, combined with  eternal inactivity, the unslumbering mind caged in the body that is  paralysed.    There is a temple at Karnak that I love, and I scarcely know why I care  for it so much. It is on the right of the solitary lotus column before  you come to the terrific hall of Seti. Some people pass it by, having  but little time, and being hypnotized, it seems, by the more astounding  ruin that lies beyond it. And perhaps it would be well, on a first  visit, to enter it last; to let its influence be the final one to rest  upon your spirit. This is the temple of Rameses III., a brown place of  calm and retirement, an ineffable place of peace. Yes, though the birds  love it and fill it often with their voices, it is a sanctuary of  peace. Upon the floor the soft sand lies, placing silence beneath your  footsteps. The pale brown of walls and columns, almost yellow in the  sunshine, is delicate and soothing, and inclines the heart to calm.  Delicious, suggestive of a beautiful tapestry, rich and ornate, yet  always quiet, are the brown reliefs upon the stone. What are they? Does  it matter? They soften the walls, make them more personal, more tender.  That surely is their mission. This temple holds for me a spell. As soon  as I enter it, I feel the touch of the lotus, as if an invisible and  kindly hand swept a blossom lightly across my face and downward to my  heart. This courtyard, these small chambers beyond it, that last doorway  framing a lovely darkness, soothe me even more than the terra-cotta  hermitages of the Certosa of Pavia. And all the statues here are calm  with an irrevocable calmness, faithful through passing years with a  very sober faithfulness to the temple they adorn. In no other place, one  feels it, could they be thus at peace, with hands crossed for ever upon  their breasts, which are torn by no anxieties, thrilled by no joys. As  one stands among them or sitting on the base of a column in the chamber  that lies beyond them, looks on them from a little distance, their  attitude is like a summons to men to contend no more, to be still, to  enter into rest.    Come to this temple when you leave the hall of Seti. There you are in  a place of triumph. Scarlet, some say, is the color of a great note  sounded on a bugle. This hall is like a bugle-call of the past,  thrilling even now down all the ages with a triumph that is surely  greater than any other triumphs. It suggests blaze--blaze of scarlet,  blaze of bugle, blaze of glory, blaze of life and time, of ambition"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34076"],[0,"Fox Trapping: A Book of Instruction Telling How to Trap, Snare, Poison and Shoot (#6)"],[1,"of like  nature, so as to prevent the gathering of moisture and a consequent  freeze. Secure to a clog, or use a grapnel. The latter is in most  cases preferable, as it may be buried from sight, while the former  adds one more to the objects likely to arouse suspicion.    The covering is something that you will pretty much have to learn for  yourself. Like swimming, no one can teach it by any amount of  talking; practice is necessary to acquire the trick. Moss, leaves and  rotten wood are the principal materials used, though pinches of  herbage and dirt may be added to harmonize with set and surroundings.  Leaves, however, should be used sparingly, as they change shape with  every phase of weather, and thus frequently spoil what would  otherwise have remained a good covering. If well rotted they give  less trouble in this respect, and offer less resistance to the jaws  in closing.    When using bait, if not setting in a bed, find a spot where little  building is required to protect it--a hollow log or stump, the  entrance to an old burrow, a niche in a ledge or hole under a rock.  Sometimes, where a trout-stream flows under a step bluff, a little  shelf is found in the face of the bluff (and one can usually be made  if it is not already there); and by placing a trap on the shelf and  the bait just above it, you have sly Mr. Fox at great disadvantage,  as he must leap from the opposite side of the brook to the embankment  to reach the bait. A projection in the face of a cliff, several feet  from the ground, if it is inaccessible from overhead or either side  may be similarly improved.    Always be on the lookout for such places as these, where those sharp  eyes and that keen, pointed nose will be kept at a distance from your  set until it is too late for them to detect signs of danger.    Old roads offer good possibilities for traps without bait. Unused  plain roads, where the grass has sprung up may be practically covered  by placing a trap in each wheel-rut and the central path. The space  under a set of bars may be partly filled with brush and two or three  traps placed side by side in the opening with good chances of  success. We say two or three traps, as by so doing a larger opening  may be left, which adds greatly to your chances. An attempt to coax  this slippery fellow into narrow quarters quickly excites his  suspicions.    Cow and sheep paths are much traveled by reynard, especially those  leading around and through swamps. These are more easily trapped than  roads, a good method being to first go along the path with your decoy  scent, applying at intervals to objects close beside the path, and  then setting traps, without bait, between the \"doctored\" points. An  old pelt of some sort dragged behind you will serve to kill your own  scent, and to keep the intended victim to the path.    As stated, an important element of successful fox trapping is to make  as little disturbance, and to leave us little scent us possible, in  working around, and going to and from trap. It follows then that one  should not only aim so to fix his traps that they will require no  actual attention under ordinary conditions of weather, except at  considerable intervals, but should invariably locate them with a view  to being able to look after them in a way not to arouse wily  reynard's suspicions.      [Illustration: WHITE FOX SKINS.]    Sometimes, when trapping along a creek or other waters where it is  not convenient to keep a boat, a rude raft may be constructed from  which to make sets, and to be employed in visiting same. It  simplifies the work one half to be able to do the whole thing by  water, as water leaves neither scent nor trail. But where it is not  possible to make use of this helpful agent, care should be taken to  select a spot that can be approached over ledgy ground, or by jumping  from rock to rock, two short strips of board to be stepped upon  alternately, being often useful in bridging over any breaks that may  occur in such line of approach.    Where this method cannot be employed, owing to the nature of the  ground, it is advisable to vary the route in visiting, as by always  following the same line a well defined trail will soon be made, which  is certain to excite suspicion in an animal as shy as the fox. When  dealing with an unusually shrewd customer, some wear snowshoes or  strap hide of some sort on the feet, either of which is not a bad  plan, as well as that of dragging a fresh pelt behind one to  obliterate one's trail.    As to making beds of chaff, while I have no personal experience with  this material, it never impressed me as being the proper thing for  the purpose, as it is out of place in the woods or fields. If a man  comes upon a pile of chaff any where away from buildings, it  instantly occurs to him as being queer that it should be in such a  place. Do you not suppose that the wild creatures, whose very  existence depends upon their sharpness of observation, are likely to  note the unfitness of the thing quicker than we? Of course, if the  chaff be deposited in place early in the season, allowing time to  discolor and decay, it may help the case, or feathers may be thrown  over the bed. But in the latter event wind may at any time remove the  covering. For myself, I have always had better luck in making sets  for any animal with materials obtained from the immediate  surroundings, and having therefore nothing foreign in smell or  appearance to offend the creature's nose or eye.    Now a few words as to the fox's regard for iron. Does he feel that it  is a thing to be avoided or not? It is my belief, brother trappers,  that he does, under certain circumstances, have a strong instinctive  fear of metal of any kind. That is to say, when he finds it in places  where as a rule it is not to be found. The fact that he will walk for  miles on the railroad track, and even upon the rails, is no argument  to the contrary, for the reason that he has become accustomed to the  iron in such places. A large quantity does not alarm him, but a small  piece, half hidden in the dirt, in field or wood where he is not  accustomed to see it, awakes his distrust. For the same reason, he  will trot deliberately out in the road in front of a passing team,  when the mere snapping of a twig beneath the hunter's feet would send  him off flying. He has learned that danger rarely comes to him from  persons traveling by team; it is of the stealthy step and the swift  act of raising a gun that instinct has taught him to stand in fear.  And so it is with respect to iron. It is all right in its place, he  knows, but he also knows that it is quite out of place--from his  standpoint, at least--in proximity to his favorite articles of diet.  Why even the stupid muskrat, who will go into people's cellars, and  in fact most everywhere else he wants to, and who will walk into any  sort of set so long as the trap be covered, will not step into a bare  trap. Dozens of times have I had my dog follow the tracks one has  made around my trap when it was left bare by falling water, but  invariably the rat has left the bait rather than put his foot on the  uncovered trap. It is absurd to think the thick-headed muskrat is  sharper in any respect than wise Mr. Fox.      [Illustration: A RHODE ISLAND SCENE.]        CHAPTER IX.    RED AND GREY.    I will give a method for trapping the grey fox, and have to say trap  him the same as the red fox, as any method that will take one will do  for the other, says L. M. Pickens, of Tennessee. The trapper can  easily tell which of these species he is setting for, as the grey fox  has more of a round track, while his red brother leaves a much larger  and longer imprint.    Each of these animals are great rovers, starting on a forage by  sunset, traveling many miles in a night; never holing up for the  bitterest freeze that comes.    Look for fox tracks in stock paths, old roads not much used, places  under fences, washouts, and in large gullies, as such places are  their travels, yet many other unnamed places suited risks for your  traps may be found if one is closely looking around.    Carry with you a hardwood stick, ready sharpened, with which to dig  the pit for your traps, and dig this lengthwise with the path, (not  across it), and deep enough so the trap will be just a little below  level of surface; now place the trap in, cover over springs and  around outside of jaws with dirt, and lay a piece of paper, flat  leaves or a piece of cloth over jaws and pan, then pulverize some of  the dirt you dug up, sprinkle over the trap 'till all is covered over  good, then lay a dead weed or stick on each side of trap two or three  inches away, which completes the set.      [Illustration: GREY FOX.]    When you fasten the trap, do not staple it, but wire the ring or end  of chain to a bush you cut, one that the fox can drag a distance,  which always leaves the same trap pit or hole in readiness for your  trap, which should immediately be smoked, set right back for another  fox which is sure to come along, and if you are careful he will he  yours, as it all depends upon skillful setting and covering the trap  chain.    Have everything look as natural when you make the set as before, and  I will guarantee the catch of every fox that comes along.    Use none but the best trap, and a Newhouse No. 2 is recommended,  handle it and everything about the set with gloves, learn to respect  the cunning of a fox by cultivating a habit of standing in one place,  always be careful not to spit, whittle or leave any paper about a  trap.    Don't use rusty traps, scour off the rust, and boil for thirty  minutes in any green bark that will coat them; willow, walnut, or  chestnut are good.    Don't lay your traps around on the ground at your sets; better carry  them in a satchel, sack or something strapped around your shoulders.    Don't whittle or spit where you are making a set.    Don't staple your"]]]
