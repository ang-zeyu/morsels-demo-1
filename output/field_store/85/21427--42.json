They  interrupt, in a measure, the vibrations produced by external blows,  and also prevent fractures from extending as far as they otherwise  would, in one continued bone. From infancy to the twelfth year, the  sutures are imperfect; but, from that time to thirty-five or forty,  they are distinctly marked; in old age, they are nearly obliterated.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. 1, 1, The coronal suture at the front and upper  part of the skull, or cranium. 2, The sagittal suture on the top of the  skull. 3, 3, The lambdoidal suture at the back part of the cranium.]    79. We find as great a diversity in the form and texture of the  skull-bone, as in the expression of the face. The head of the New  Hollander is small; that of the African is compressed; while the  Caucasian is distinguished for the beautiful oval form of the head.  The Greek skulls, in texture, are close and fine, while the Swiss are  softer and more open.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    78. How are the bones of the skull united?

What is said respecting the form and  texture of the skull in different nations?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    80. In each EAR are four very small bones. They aid in hearing.    81. In the FACE are fourteen bones, some of which serve for the  attachment of powerful muscles, which are more or less called into  action in masticating food; others retain in place the soft parts of  the face.    [Illustration: Fig. 8. 1, The frontal, or bone of the forehead. 2.

The cavity for the eye.]    82. The TRUNK has fifty-four bones--twenty-four _Ribs_; twenty-four  bones in the _Spi'nal Col'umn_, (back-bone;) four in the _Pel'vis_;  the _Ster'num_, (breast-bone;) and the _Os hy-oid'es_, (the bone at  the base of the tongue.) They are so arranged as to form, with the  soft parts attached to them, two cavities, called the _Tho'rax_  (chest) and _Ab-do'men_.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    80.

What do they  form by their arrangement?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    83. The THORAX is formed by the sternum in front; the ribs, at the  sides; and the twelve dorsal bones of the spinal column, posteriorly.  The natural form of the chest is a cone, with its apex above; but  fashion, in many instances, has nearly inverted this order. This  cavity contains the lungs, heart, and large blood-vessels.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. 1, The first bone of the sternum, (breast-bone.)  2.

The STERNUM is composed of eight pieces in the child. These unite  and form but three parts in the adult. In youth, the two upper  portions are converted into bone, while the lower portion remains  cartilaginous and flexible until extreme old age, when it is often  converted into bone.    85. The RIBS are connected with the spinal column, and increase in  length as far as the seventh. From this they successively become  shorter. The direction of the ribs from above, downward, is oblique,  and their curve diminishes from the first to the twelfth. The external  surface of each rib is convex; the internal, concave. The inferior, or  lower ribs, are, however, very flat.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    83. Describe the thorax. Explain fig. 9. 84. Describe the sternum. 85.  Describe the ribs.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    86. The seven upper ribs are united to the sternum, through the medium  of cartilages, and are called the _true ribs_. The cartilages of the  next three are united with each other, and are not attached to the  sternum; these are called _false ribs_. The lowest two are called  _floating ribs_, as they are not connected either with the sternum or  the other ribs.    87. The SPINAL COLUMN is composed of twenty-four pieces of bone. Each  piece is called a _vert'e-bra_. On examining one of the bones, we find  seven projections, called _processes_; four of these, that are  employed in binding the bones together, are called _articulating_  processes; two of the remaining are called the _transverse_; and the  other, the _spinous_. The last three give attachment to the muscles of  the back.    88. The large part of the vertebra, called the body, is round and  spongy in its texture, like the extremity of the round bones. The  processes are of a more dense character. The projections are so  arranged that a tube, or canal, is formed immediately behind the  bodies of the vertebrae, in which is placed the _me-dul'la spi-na'lis_,  (spinal cord,) sometimes called the pith of the back-bone.    89. Between these joints, or vertebrae, is a peculiar and highly  elastic substance, which much facilitates the bending movements of the  back. This compressible cushion of cartilage also serves the important  purpose of diffusing and diminishing the shock in walking, running, or  leaping, and tends to protect the delicate texture of the brain.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    86. How are the ribs united to the sternum? 87. Describe the spinal  column. 88. Give the structure of the vertebra. Where is the spinal  cord placed? 89. What is placed between each vertebra? What is its  use?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    90. Another provision for the protection of the brain, which bears  convincing proof of the wisdom and beneficence of the Creator, is the  antero-posterior, or forward and backward curve of the spinal column.  Were it a straight column, standing perpendicularly, the slightest  jar, in walking, would cause it to recoil with a sudden jerk; because,  the weight bearing equally, the spine would neither yield to the one  side nor the other. But, shaped as it is, we find it yielding in the  direction of the curves, and thus the force of the shock is diffused.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.

The PELVIS is composed of four bones; the two _in-nom-i-na'ta_,  (nameless bones,) the _sa'crum_, and the _coc'cyx_.    92. The INNOMINATUM, in the child, consists of three pieces. These,  in the adult, become united, and constitute but one bone. In the sides  of these bones is a deep socket, or depression, like a cup, called the  _ac-e-tab'u-lum_, in which the round head of the thigh-bone is  placed.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    90. What is said of the curves of the spinal column? What is  represented by fig. 10? By fig. 11? How can the structure of the  vertebrae be seen? 91. Of how many bones is the pelvis composed? 92.  What is said of the innominatum in the child?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    93. The SACRUM, so called because the ancients offered it in  sacrifices, is a wedge-shaped bone, that is placed between the  innominata, and to which it is bound by ligaments. Upon its upper  surface it connects with the lower vertebra. At its inferior, or lower  angle, it is united to the coccyx. It is concave upon its anterior,  and convex upon its posterior surface.

The COCCYX, in infants, consists of several pieces, which, in  youth, become united and form one bone. This is the terminal extremity  of the spinal column.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    In the adult? Describe the acetabulum. 93. Describe the sacrum.  Explain fig. 12. 94. Describe the coccyx.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER V.    ANATOMY OF THE BONES, CONTINUED      95. The bones of the upper and lower limbs are enlarged at each  extremity, and have projections, or processes. To these, the tendons  of muscles and ligaments are attached, which connect one bone with  another. The shaft of these bones is cylindrical and hollow, and in  structure, their exterior surface is hard and compact, while the  interior portion is of a reticulated character. The enlarged  extremities of the round bones are more porous than the main shaft.    96. The UPPER EXTREMITIES contain sixty-four bones--the _Scap'u-la_,  (shoulder-blade;) the _Clav'i-cle_, (collar-bone;) the _Hu'mer-us_,  (first bone of the arm;) the _Ul'na_ and _Ra'di-us_, (bones of the  fore-arm;) the _Car'pus_, (wrist;) the _Met-a-car'pus_, (palm of the  hand;) and the _Pha-lan'ges_, (fingers and thumb.)    97. The CLAVICLE is attached, at one extremity, to the sternum; at the  other, it is united to the scapula. It is shaped like the Italic  _[s]_. Its use is to"]]]
