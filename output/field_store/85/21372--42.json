I went  forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working  now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.\"    \"Touch my robe!\"    Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.    The whole scene vanished instantly and they stood in the city streets on  Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a  rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow  from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of  their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come  plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little  snowstorms.    Perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing his sympathy  with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there  he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the  threshold of the door the spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob  Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch.    Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a  twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a  goodly show; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit,  second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter  Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes. And now two  smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside  the baker's they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own.    \"What has ever got your precious father, then?\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"And  your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by  half-an-hour!\"    \"Here's Martha, mother,\" said a girl appearing as she spoke.    \"Here's Martha, mother,\" cried the two young Cratchits. \"Hurrah! There's  _such_ a goose, Martha!\"    \"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\" said Mrs.  Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet  for her with officious zeal.    \"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the girl, \"and  had to clear away this morning, mother!\"    \"Well! never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"Sit ye  down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!\"    \"No no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young Cratchits, who were  everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha, hide!\"    So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least  three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him;  and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable;  and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little  crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!    \"Why, Where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit looking round.    \"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.    \"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;  for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and had come  home rampant. \"Not coming upon Christmas Day!\"    Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so  she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his  arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off  into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the  copper.    \"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had  rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his  heart's content.    \"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful,  sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever  heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the  church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to  remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men  see.\"    Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when  he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.    His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny  Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister  to his stool beside the fire; and Master Peter and the two ubiquitous  young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned  in high procession.    Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)  hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor;  Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot-plates;  Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two  young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and  mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest  they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At  last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a  breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the  carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,  and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of  delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two  young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and  feebly cried Hurrah!    There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was  such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavor, size and cheapness, were  the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and mashed  potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as  Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a  bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every one had  had enough. But now the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs.  Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to bear witnesses--to take the  pudding up, and bring it in.    Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he  regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since  their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind,  she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.  Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it  was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat  heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a  thing.    At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth  swept, and the fire made up. Apples and oranges were put upon the table  and a shovelful of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family  drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning  half a one. Then Bob proposed: \"A Merry Christmas to all, my dears. God  bless us!\"    Which all the family re-echoed.    \"God bless us, every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.    He sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held  his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child and wished to  keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.    \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, \"tell  me if Tiny Tim will live.\"    \"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor chimney corner,  and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows  remain unaltered by the Future the child will die.\"    \"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.\"    \"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,\"  returned the Ghost, \"will find him here. What then? If he be like to  die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"    Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and  was overcome with penitence and grief.    \"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear  that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where  it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may  be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to  live than millions like this poor man's child. Oh, God! to hear the  insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry  brothers in the dust!\"    Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon  the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.    \"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the  Feast!\"    \"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. \"I  wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and  I hope he'd have a good appetite for it.\"    \"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas day.\"    Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark  shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.    After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from  the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit  told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter. The two  young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man  of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from  between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular  investments he should favor when he came into receipt of the bewildering  income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's, then told  them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at  a stretch, and how she meant to be abed to-morrow morning for a good  long rest, to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she  had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord \"was  much about as tall as Peter,\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so  high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. By and  by they had a song, about a lost child traveling in the snow, from Tiny  Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.    There was nothing of high mark "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#6)"],[1,"cooling circuit. The water enters at A, and the flow is  regulated by the needle-valve at left-hand side. Rate of flow can be  seen at end of exit tube just above the union. The water flows out at C  and compressed air is admitted at B, regulated by the pet-cock.]    The best results have been obtained, however, with an entirely new  principle, namely, a few drops of water are continually allowed to pass  into the pipe, together with a steady stream of compressed air. This  cold water is forcibly blown through the pipe, thus cooling to an amount  regulated by the amount of water admitted. Furthermore, the relatively  dry air evaporates some of the water, thereby producing a somewhat  greater cooling effect. By adjusting the flow of water through the pipe  a continuous cooling effect of mild degree may be obtained. While  formerly the air in the space next the zinc wall was either cooled or  heated alternately by opening the water-valve or by passing a current  through the heating coil, at present it is found much more advantageous  to allow a slow flow of air and water through the pipes continuously,  thus having the air-space normally somewhat cooler than is desired. The  effect of this cooling, therefore, is then counterbalanced by passing an  electric current of varying strength through the heating wire. By this  manipulation it is unnecessary that the observer manipulate more than  one instrument, namely, the rheostat, while formerly he had to  manipulate valves, compressed-air cocks, and rheostat. The arrangement  for providing for the amount of compressed air and water is shown in  fig. 13, in which it is seen that a small drop-sight feed-water valve is  attached to the pipe C leading into the dead air-space surrounding the  calorimeter chamber. Compressed air enters at B and the amount entering  can be regulated by the pet-cock. The amount of water admitted is  readily observed by the sight feed-valve. When once adjusted this form  of apparatus produces a relatively constant cooling effect and  facilitates greatly the manipulation of the calorimetric apparatus as a  whole.      THE THERMO-ELECTRIC ELEMENTS.    In order to detect differences in temperature between the copper and  zinc walls, some system for measuring temperature differences between  these walls is essential. For this purpose we have found nothing that is  as practical as the system of iron-German-silver thermo-electric  elements originally introduced in this type of calorimeter by E. B.  Rosa, of the National Bureau of Standards, formerly professor of physics  at Wesleyan University. In these calorimeters the same principle,  therefore, has been applied, and it is necessary here only to give the  details of such changes in the construction of the elements, their  mounting, and their insulation as have been made as a result of  experience in constructing these calorimeters. An element consisting of  four pairs of junctions is shown in place as T-J in fig. 25.    One ever-present difficulty with the older form of element was the  tendency for the German-silver wires to slip out of the slots in which  they had been vigorously crowded in the hard maple spool. In thus  slipping out of the slots they came in contact with the metal thimble in  the zinc wall and thus produced a ground. In constructing the new  elements four pairs of iron-German-silver thermal junctions were made on  essentially the same plan as that previously described,[6] the only  modification being made in the spool. While the ends of the junctions  nearest the copper are exposed to the air so as to take up most rapidly  the temperature of the copper, it is somewhat difficult to expose the  ends of the junctions nearest the zinc and at the same time avoid  short-circuiting. The best procedure is to extend the rock maple spool  which passes clear through the ferule in the zinc wall and cut a wide  slot in the spool so as to expose the junctions to the air nearest the  ferule. By so doing the danger to the unprotected ends of the junctions  is much less. The two lead-wires of German silver can be carried through  the end of the spool and thus allow the insulation to be made much more  satisfactorily. In these calorimeters free use of these thermal  junctions has been made. In the chair calorimeter there are on the top  16 elements consisting of four junctions each, on the rear 18, on the  front 8, and on the bottom 13. The distribution of the elements is made  with due reference to the direction in which the heat is most directly  radiated and conducted from the surface of the body.    While the original iron-German-silver junctions have been retained in  two of these calorimeters for the practical reason that a large number  of these elements had been constructed beforehand, we believe it will be  more advantageous to use the copper-constantin couple, which has a  thermo-electric force of 40 microvolts per degree as against the 25 of  the iron-German-silver couple. It is planned to install the  copper-constantin junctions in the calorimeters now building.      INTERIOR OF THE CALORIMETER.    Since the experiments to be made with this chamber will rarely exceed 6  to 8 hours, there is no provision made for installing a cot bed or other  conveniences which would be necessary for experiments of long duration.  Aside from the arm-chair with the foot-rest suspended from the balance,  there is practically no furniture inside of the chamber, and a shelf or  two, usually attached to the chair, to support bottles for urine and  drinking-water bottles, completes the furniture equipment. The  construction of the calorimeter is such as to minimize the volume of air  surrounding the subject and yet secure sufficient freedom of movement to  have him comfortable. A general impression of the arrangement of the  pipes, chair, telephone, etc., inside the chamber can be obtained from  figs. 7 and 9. The heat-absorber system is attached to rings soldered to  the ceiling at different points. The incoming air-pipe is carried to the  top of the central dome, while the air is drawn from the calorimeter at  a point at the lower front near the position of the feet of the subject.  From this point it is carried through a pipe along the floor and up the  rear wall of the calorimeter to the exit.    With the perfect heat insulation obtaining, the heat production of the  man would soon raise the temperature to an uncomfortable degree were  there no provisions for withdrawing it. It is therefore necessary to  cool the chamber and, as has been pointed out, the cooling is  accomplished by passing a current of cold water through a heat-absorbing  apparatus permanently installed in the interior of the chamber. The  heat-absorber consists of a continuous copper pipe of 6 millimeters  internal diameter and 10 millimeters external diameter. Along this pipe  there are soldered a large number of copper disks 5 centimeters in  diameter at a distance of 5 millimeters from each other. This increases  enormously the area for the absorption of heat. In order to allow the  absorber system to be removed, added to, or repaired at any time, it is  necessary to insert couplings at several points. This is usually done at  corners where the attachment of disks is not practicable. The total  length of heat-absorbers is 5.6 meters and a rough calculation shows  that the total area of metal for the absorption of heat is 4.7 square  meters. The total volume of water in the absorbers is 254 cubic  centimeters.    It has been found advantageous to place a simple apparatus to mix the  water in the water-cooling circuit at a point just before the water  leaves the chamber. This water-mixer consists of a 15-centimeter length  of standard 1-inch pipe with a cap at each end. Through each of these  caps there is a piece of one-eighth-inch pipe which extends nearly the  whole length of the mixer. The water thus passing into one end returns  inside the 1-inch pipe and leaves from the other. This simple device  insures a thorough mixing.    The air-pipes are of thin brass, 1-inch internal diameter. One of them  conducts the air from the ingoing air-pipe up into the top of the  central dome or hood immediately above the head of the subject. The air  thus enters the chamber through a pipe running longitudinally along the  top of the dome. On the upper side of this pipe a number of holes have  been drilled so as to have the air-current directed upwards rather than  down against the head of the subject. With this arrangement no  difficulties are experienced with uncomfortable drafts and although the  air enters the chamber through this pipe absolutely dry, there is no  uncomfortable sensation of extreme dryness in the air taken in at the  nostrils, nor is the absorption of water from the skin of the face,  head, or neck great enough to produce an uncomfortable feeling of cold.  The other air-pipe, as suggested, receives the air from the chamber at  the lower front and passes around the rear to the point where the  outside air-pipe leaves the chamber.    The chamber is illuminated by a small glass door in the food aperture.  This is a so-called \"port\" used on vessels. Sufficient light passes  through this glass to enable the subject to see inside the calorimeter  without difficulty and most of the subjects can read with comfort. If an  electric light is placed outside of the window, the illumination is very  satisfactory and repeated tests have shown that no measurable amount of  heat passes through the window by placing a 32 c. p. electric lamp 0.5  meter from the food aperture outside. More recently we have arranged to  produce directly inside the chamber illumination by means of a small  tungsten electric lamp connected to the storage battery outside of the  chamber. This lamp is provided with a powerful mirror and a glass shade,  so that the light is very bright throughout the chamber and is  satisfactory for reading. It is necessary,"]]]
