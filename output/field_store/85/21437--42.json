[Footnote n: Fortesc. _de laud. LL._ _c._ 25.]    [Footnote o: This remarkably appeared in the case of the abbot of  Torun, _M._ 22 _E._ 3. 24. who had caused a certain prior to be  summoned to answer at Avignon for erecting an oratory _contra  inhibitionem novi operis_; by which words Mr Selden, (_in Flet._ 8.  5.) very justly understands to be meant the title _de novi operis  nuntiatione_ both in the civil and canon laws, (_Ff._ 39. 1. _C._ 8.  11. and _Decretal._ not _Extrav._ 5. 32.) whereby the erection of any  new buildings in prejudice of more antient ones was prohibited. But  Skipwith the king's serjeant, and afterwards chief baron of the  exchequer, declares them to be flat nonsense; \"_in ceux parolx_,  contra inhibitionem novi operis, _ny ad pas entendment_:\" and justice  Schardelow mends the matter but little by informing him, that they  signify a restitution _in their law_; for which reason he very sagely  resolves to pay no sort of regard to them. \"_Ceo n'est que un  restitution en lour ley, pur que a ceo n'avomus regard, &c._\"]    THE incident I mean was the fixing the court of common pleas, the  grand tribunal for disputes of property, to be held in one certain  spot; that the seat of ordinary justice might be permanent and  notorious to all the nation. Formerly that, in conjunction with all  the other superior courts, was held before the king's capital  justiciary of England, in the _aula regis_, or such of his palaces  wherein his royal person resided; and removed with his houshold from  one end of the kingdom to the other. This was found to occasion great  inconvenience to the suitors; to remedy which it was made an article  of the great charter of liberties, both that of king John and king  Henry the third[p], that \"common pleas should no longer follow the  king's court, but be held in some certain place:\" in consequence of  which they have ever since been held (a few necessary removals in  times of the plague excepted) in the palace of Westminster only. This  brought together the professors of the municipal law, who before were  dispersed about the kingdom, and formed them into an aggregate body;  whereby a society was established of persons, who (as Spelman[q]  observes) addicting themselves wholly to the study of the laws of the  land, and no longer considering it as a mere subordinate science for  the amusement of leisure hours, soon raised those laws to that pitch  of perfection, which they suddenly attained under the auspices of our  English Justinian, king Edward the first.    [Footnote p: _c._ 11.]    [Footnote q: _Glossar._ 334.]    IN consequence of this lucky assemblage, they naturally fell into a  kind of collegiate order, and, being excluded from Oxford and  Cambridge, found it necessary to establish a new university of their  own. This they did by purchasing at various times certain houses (now  called the inns of court and of chancery) between the city of  Westminster, the place of holding the king's courts, and the city of  London; for advantage of ready access to the one, and plenty of  provisions in the other[r]. Here exercises were performed, lectures  read, and degrees were at length conferred in the common law, as at  other universities in the canon and civil. The degrees were those of  barristers (first stiled apprentices[s] from _apprendre_, to learn)  who answered to our bachelors; as the state and degree of a  serjeant[t], _servientis ad legem_, did to that of doctor.    [Footnote r: Fortesc. _c._ 48.]    [Footnote s: Apprentices or Barristers seem to have been first  appointed by an ordinance of king Edward the first in parliament, in  the 20th year of his reign. (Spelm. _Gloss._ 37. Dugdale. _Orig.  jurid._ 55.)]    [Footnote t: The first mention I have met with in our lawbooks of  serjeants or countors, is in the statute of Westm. 1. 3 Edw. I. c. 29.  and in Horn's Mirror, _c._ 1. Sec. 10. _c._ 2. Sec. 5. _c._ 3. Sec. 1. in  the same reign. But M. Paris in his life of John II, abbot of St.  Alban's, which he wrote in 1255, 39 Hen. III. speaks of advocates at  the common law, or countors (_quos banci narratores vulgariter  appellamus_) as of an order of men well known. And we have an example  of the antiquity of the coif in the same author's history of England,  _A.D._ 1259. in the case of one William de Bussy; who, being called to  account for his great knavery and malpractices, claimed the benefit of  his orders or clergy, which till then remained an entire secret; and  to that end _voluit ligamenta coifae suae solvere, ut palam monstraret  se tonsuram habere clericalem; sed non est permissus.----Satelles vero  eum arripiens, non per coifae ligamina sed per guttur eum  apprehendens, traxit ad carcerem_. And hence sir H. Spelman  conjectures, (_Glossar._ 335.) that coifs were introduced to hide the  tonsure of such renegade clerks, as were still tempted to remain in  the secular courts in the quality of advocates or judges,  notwithstanding their prohibition by canon.]    THE crown seems to have soon taken under it's protection this infant  seminary of common law; and, the more effectually to foster and  cherish it, king Henry the third in the nineteenth year of his reign  issued out an order directed to the mayor and sheriffs of London,  commanding that no regent of any law schools _within_ that city should  for the future teach law therein[u]. The word, law, or _leges_, being  a general term, may create some doubt at this distance of time whether  the teaching of the civil law, or the common, or both, is hereby  restrained. But in either case it tends to the same end. If the civil  law only is prohibited, (which is Mr Selden's[w] opinion) it is then a  retaliation upon the clergy, who had excluded the common law from  _their_ seats of learning. If the municipal law be also included in  the restriction, (as sir Edward Coke[x] understands it, and which the  words seem to import) then the intention is evidently this; by  preventing private teachers within the walls of the city, to collect  all the common lawyers into the one public university, which was newly  instituted in the suburbs.    [Footnote u: _Ne aliquis scholas regens de legibus in eadem civitate  de caetero ibidem leges doceat._]    [Footnote w: _in Flet._ 8. 2.]    [Footnote x: 2 Inst. proem.]    IN this juridical university (for such it is insisted to have been by  Fortescue[y] and sir Edward Coke[z]) there are two sorts of collegiate  houses; one called inns of chancery, in which the younger students of  the law were usually placed, \"learning and studying, says  Fortescue[a], the originals and as it were the elements of the law;  who, profiting therein, as they grow to ripeness so are they admitted  into the greater inns of the same study, called the inns of court.\"  And in these inns of both kinds, he goes on to tell us, the knights  and barons, with other grandees and noblemen of the realm, did use to  place their children, though they did not desire to have them  thoroughly learned in the law, or to get their living by it's  practice: and that in his time there were about two thousand students  at these several inns, all of whom he informs us were _filii  nobilium_, or gentlemen born.    [Footnote y: _c._ 49.]    [Footnote z: 3 Rep. pref.]    [Footnote a: _ibid._]    HENCE it is evident, that (though under the influence of the monks our  universities neglected this study, yet) in the time of Henry the sixth  it was thought highly necessary and was the universal practice, for  the young nobility and gentry to be instructed in the originals and  elements of the laws. But by degres [Transcriber's Note: degrees] this  custom has fallen into disuse; so that in the reign of queen Elizabeth  sir Edward Coke[b] does not reckon above a thousand students, and the  number at present is very considerably less. Which seems principally  owing to these reasons: first, because the inns of chancery being now  almost totally filled by the inferior branch of the profession, they  are neither commodious nor proper for the resort of gentlemen of any  rank or figure; so that there are now very rarely any young students  entered at the inns of chancery: secondly, because in the inns of  court all sorts of regimen and academical superintendance, either with  regard to morals or studies, are found impracticable and therefore  entirely neglected: lastly, because persons of birth and fortune,  after having finished their usual courses at the universities, have  seldom leisure or resolution sufficient to enter upon a new scheme of  study at a new place of instruction. Wherefore few gentlemen now  resort to the inns of court, but such for whom the knowlege of  practice is absolutely necessary; such, I mean, as are intended for  the profession: the rest of our gentry, (not to say our nobility also)  having usually retired to their estates, or visited foreign kingdoms,  or entered upon public life, without any instruction in the laws of  the land; and indeed with hardly any opportunity of gaining  instruction, unless it can be afforded them in these seats of  learning.    [Footnote b: _ibid._]    AND that these are the proper places, for affording assistances of  this kind to gentlemen of all stations and degrees, cannot (I think)  with any colour of reason be denied. For not one of the objections,  which are made to the inns of court and chancery, and which I have  just enumerated, will hold with regard to the universities. Gentlemen  may here associate with gentlemen of their own rank and degree. Nor  are their conduct and studies left entirely to their own discretion;  but regulated by a discipline so wise and exact, yet so liberal, so  sensible and manly, that their conformity to it's rules (which does at  present so much honour to our youth) is not more the effect of  constraint, than of their own inclinations"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#6)"],[1,"water and  left to soak for three days. The strips are then washed several times  in the river during a period of three days, and they are then laid  on the grass or along fences to dry after each washing. The oftener  they are alternately washed and dried the whiter and tougher will  the material be. After the final drying, which should be thorough,  the strips are rolled very tightly into bundles.    The San Luis Method.--The method of whitening buri straw followed in  San Luis, Pampanga, is described by Mr. James H. Bass, supervising  teacher. The unopened leaves are brought down the Chico River in  rafts. The segments are torn from the midrib and boiled for four  hours in five gallons of water to which one liter of nipa vinegar,  a lump of alum the size of an egg, a handful of tamarind leaves,  and a handful of pandakaki leaves (see bleaching agents) have been  added. Other steps follow as in the previous process.    The Mauban Process.--The following description is taken from Circular  No. 27, series 1911, of the Division of Tayabas. Let the unopened  leaves, cut from the stalk, stand in a cool shady place several  days, until the sap has well run. Open the leaves and separate the  segments from the midrib with a sharp knife. Put these carefully into  a petroleum can or other suitable receptacle filled with a boiling  solution of two-thirds water and one-third white nipa or coconut tuba  vinegar (see bleaching agents). Keep the solution boiling until the  segments are cooked so soft that folding them leaves no crease.    Spread the cooked leaves on clean grass in the sun to dry. The drying  process may require one or two days. When the segments are quite dry,  prepare a jar with clear soft water, and put them in this to soak over  night. In the morning remove them from the jar, wash them thoroughly  in clear running soft water and place them in the sun. At noon repeat  the washing process until the segments open, then dry thoroughly in  the sun.    It is customary to roll the buri into coils in order to make it more  convenient to store. The dry leaflets may be made flexible for this  purpose by laying them on the grass in the night air. After a few  minutes they will be flexible enough to roll. Care must be taken to  have the segments smoothly rolled. When used, they should be smoothed  carefully and then split into the widths required.    The process can also be followed with rice vinegar (see bleaching  agents) substituted for the tuba vinegar.    Wash two chupas of rice and cook it in water until it becomes very  soft and starchy. Put this in a clean petroleum can and add cold  water until the can is two-thirds full, then cover the can and let it  stand five or six days. This mixture will become very sour. Strain it  through a piece of sinamay or other cloth. Cook the segments in this  mixture instead of in the solution described in the first process,  and then carry out all the other steps.    The Romblon Process.--In Romblon, great care is exercised as to the  age of the unopened leaf taken for the production of straw. If it  is intended to produce bleached straw, stalks having stems about  two inches long are selected. In the following description, which  was submitted by Mr. R. L. Barron, head teacher, one unopened leaf  is taken as a unit. The midribs are removed and the segments are  rolled into round bundles, say by fives. These are boiled in clear  water for about three hours. The leaves are then placed in a mixture  of half a liter of tuba vinegar (or three liters of vinegar made from  cooked rice, or one-fourth liter of lemon juice) to which enough water  has been added to cover the rolls of buri, and boiled for about five  hours. The material is then spread in the sun for three days to dry,  care being taken that it is not exposed to rain or dew. The segments  are then placed in cool clear water for twelve hours and again placed  out in the sun for two days to dry.        The Dyeing of Buri Straw.    Buri straw intended for mats is usually colored with the cheap  imported coal tar dyes previously noted. It is expected that the new  dyes for which the Bureau of Education has arranged will take the  place of these. Romblon buri mats, which are the finest in point of  workmanship and design made in the Philippines, are colored entirely  by local vegetable dyes.    The methods used in the island of Romblon in dyeing buri straw  have been carefully investigated by Mr. Barron, and are presented  herewith. In each case the unit of material is one stalk of buri for  each color. The process of whitening Romblon buri straw has already  been described.    For red, unopened leaves having stems three feet long should be  selected. The midribs are removed while green, and the leaves are  rolled into bundles of convenient size, say by fives. These are boiled  in clear water for about three hours, after which the segments are  spread in the sun for three days to dry. Care should be taken that  they are not exposed to rain or dew. They are then placed in a fluid  made by boiling two gantas of kolis leaves (see mordants) in plain  water for one hour. The buri leaves remain in the water and soak  thus for three days and three nights. The buri leaflets are then  placed in a vessel containing two gantas of sappan wood (see dyes),  one-half liter of lime water, and one chupa of tobacco leaves. To this  a sufficient quantity of plain water is added to thoroughly submerge  the buri, and the whole is boiled for eight hours, being stirred  at short intervals to obtain a uniform shade of red. The segments  are then removed and hung in the wind for about six hours to dry,  after which they are smoothed and rolled.    For yellow-orange, unopened leaves having stems about two inches long  are selected and the segments are removed from the midribs and rolled  into bundles. These are boiled in clear water for about three hours  and spread in the sun for three days to dry, care being taken that  the buri is not exposed to rain or dew. The material is then placed  in a vessel containing one ganta of powdered turmeric (see dyes), one  chupa of powdered annatto seeds (see dyes), one liter of lime water,  and sufficient clear water to cover the buri, and is boiled in this  mixture for five hours, with frequent stirring. It is then removed and  hung in the wind for one-half day to dry, and is smoothed and rolled.    For green, an unopened leaf having a stem about two inches in length  is selected. The segments are removed from the midribs, rolled into  bundles and boiled in clear water for about three hours. After this,  they are boiled in lye (consisting of ashes) for about two hours, the  mixture of ashes and water covering the buri during the process. The  bundles are then removed from the vessel, wrapped in a bayon, and put  in a dark place for 48 hours. The segments are then taken out and hung  in the wind for about three hours to dry, and are smoothed and rolled.    The preliminary steps in the production of \"black straw\" (a cold  dark gray) are the same in the making of the green material. The  segments taken from the bayon, as described above, are buried three  days in black mud, in a rice paddy, for instance. The material is then  washed in plain water until clean, and is then boiled for two hours  in a mixture of one-half ganta each of the leaves of talisay, indigo,  and tiagkot (see dyes), with a sufficient quantity of water to cover  the mixture. The whole should be stirred at frequent intervals. After  two hours the strips are removed and hung in the wind for five hours  to dry. Then they are smoothed and rolled.        Types of Buri Mats.    The Bontoc Peninsula of Tayabas produces great quantities of baling  mats and bayons. Bayons are also produced in large quantities in  Capiz province. Other localities are of less importance.    Buri sleeping mats are made from the northernmost part of Luzon,  in the Bangui Peninsula, to the Sulu Archipelago. For the most part  they are woven in small numbers here and there, in the different  towns, sometimes for use in the household in which they are made,  often for local trade in the barrios or municipalities. In nearly  every province there is at least one town in which the production  of buri mats reaches provincial commercial importance. A number  of municipalities produce them for a fairly extensive trade with  neighboring provinces. In most cases these are ordinary products,  usually decorated with a few colors in lines or checks of dyed straws,  either woven in or embroidered on the mat.    In one region, however, buri mats have reached such a degree of  perfection in their weaving and decoration as to have become a  distinctive product known throughout the Islands. These are the  Romblon buri mats, and they are produced throughout the islands of  Romblon. Their central market is the town of the same name. They are  distinctive because of the fine white and colored materials used,  and of the designs which are woven in them. In the designing, not  only checks and line borders but also plaids appear, and many of the  effects produced by floating straws are employed. The Romblon mat,  moreover, is most noticeable because of the fancy weave, making a sort  of open work along the border, for which these mats are unique. Romblon  exports great quantities of mats varying in price from P0.25, to over  P10, and in size from small mats for stands to large decorative mats  which cover the sides of rooms.

[10] The common forms  occasionally planted in pots as house plants and in gardens, or more  often found growing wild, have long and rather narrow leaves always  supplied with more or less sharp spines which run along both their  margins to the very tip.
