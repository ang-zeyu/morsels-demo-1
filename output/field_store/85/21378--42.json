[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#6)"],[1,"dementia praecox, have very little true relationship to the sexual  life of the child. In any case, Freud has not systematically studied the  individual manifestations of the sexual life of the child. I must also  mention a small work by Koetscher, _Das Erwachen des Geschlechtsbewusstseins  und seine Anomalien_ (_The Awakening of the Consciousness of Sex and its  Anomalies_, Wiesbaden, 1907). Koetscher, however, does not give any  detailed account of the sexual life of the child; he starts, rather,  from the sexual life of the adult, and only as a supplement to his  account of this does he give a few data regarding the awakening of the  consciousness of sex. In the _American Journal of Psychology_, July  1902, we find an elaborate study of the sexual life of the child. In  this paper, _A Preliminary Study of the Emotion of Love between the  Sexes_, the writer, Sanford Bell, devotes much attention to the  love-sentiments in childhood. He discusses, indeed, only heterosexual,  qualitatively normal inclinations, and his essay deals only with the  psychological aspects of the question. The processes taking place in the  genital organs do not come within the scope of the writer's  observations, and, indeed, are outside the limits of his chosen theme. A  great many other points connected with the question are also left  untouched. None the less, the paper is full of matter. The same must be  said of the works of the English investigator, Havelock Ellis, who is,  in my opinion, the leader of all those at present engaged in the study  of sexual psychology and pathology. Unfortunately his writings are not  so well known in Germany as they deserve to be, the reason being that  owing to their strictly scientific character they are not so noisily  obtruded on the public notice as are certain other widely advertised and  reputedly scientific works. In his various books, and above all in his  six volumes entitled _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_ (F. A. Davies  Company, Philadelphia, Pa.), as a part of his general contributions to  our knowledge of the sexual life, Havelock Ellis records numerous  observations relating to the years of childhood; especially valuable in  this connexion are the biographies given in the third volume of the  above-mentioned _Studies_.    A valuable source of data for our field of inquiry exists in the form of  unpublished diaries, autobiographies, and albums, which are not  accessible to the general public. I have myself had the opportunity of  studying a number of records of this nature, and have formed the opinion  that a quantity of invaluable material lies hidden in these recesses. I  may add that the records I have been able to use have not only related  to living persons; in addition, I have been able to study a number of  albums and diaries dating from an earlier day. These have remained  unpublished, in part because they appeared to be of interest only to the  families of the writers, and in part because many of them were in  intention purely private memoranda, a written record for the sole use of  the writer.    Speaking generally, however, this province of research has received but  little scientific attention; and of comprehensive studies, intended to  throw light on every aspect of the sexual life of the child, not a  single one is known to me.          Chapter II    THE SEXUAL ORGANS--THE SEXUAL IMPULSE      A proper understanding of physiological functions is based upon  anatomical knowledge of the organs concerned. For our purpose,  therefore, a knowledge of the sexual organs of the child is essential.  The proper course, in this instance, appears to be to start with an  account of the adult organs, and then to describe the distinctive  characteristics of the same organs in the child. Let us, then, begin  with the organs of the adult man.    The _membrum virile_ or _penis_ is visible externally, and behind it is  situated the scrotum. Within this latter are two ovoid structures, named  _testicles_ or _testes_. Each testicle is enveloped in a fibrous  capsule, known as the _tunica albuginea_, from which fibrous _septa_  pass into the interior of the organ, thus dividing it into a number of  separate _lobules_. Each lobule is composed of _seminiferous tubules_,  which are greatly convoluted and likewise branched, the branches being  continuous with those of neighbouring tubules, both within the same  lobule, and (by perforating the fibrous septa) in adjoining lobules. In  the walls of the seminiferous tubules the _spermatozoa_ are formed. The  seminiferous tubules unite to form the efferent ducts (_vasa  efferentia_), about a dozen in number for each testicle; immediately  passing out of the testicle, these efferent ducts make up the  _epididymis_, situated at the upper and back part of the testicle. After  numerous convolutions, these unite at length on each side to form a  single canal, which leaves the epididymis under the name of the _vas  deferens_; this is the excretory duct of the testicle, conveying the  secretion of that organ to the exterior. The vas deferens traverses the  inguinal canal into the abdominal cavity, and therein passes downwards  to the prostatic portion of the urethra (_vide infra_). The anterior  portion only of the _penis_ is visible externally, dependent in front  of the scrotum; the posterior portion is concealed by the scrotum and  the skin of the perineum. The terminal segment of the penis is formed by  the _glans_, which is covered by the _foreskin_ or _prepuce_. This last  is sometimes artificially removed: either on ritual grounds, as, for  instance, among the Jews; or for medical reasons, for example, when the  preputial orifice is greatly constricted. At the anterior extremity of  the glans penis is the orifice of the urethra (_meatus_). The _urethra_  is a canal running through the entire length of the penis, opening by  its proximal extremity into the urinary bladder, and serving for the  passage of the urine from the bladder to the exterior of the body. The  main substance of the penis is composed of three cavernous bodies, the  paired _corpora cavernosa penis_, and the single _corpus spongiosum_, or  _corpus cavernosum urethrae_. These consist of what is known as _erectile  tissue_, a spongy mass within whose lacunar spaces a large quantity of  blood can, in certain conditions, be retained. When this occurs, the  penis becomes notably thicker and longer, and simultaneously hard and  inflexible. This process is known as _erection_ of the penis, and is  requisite to render possible the introduction of the organ into the  genital canal of the female.    The proximal segment of the urethra is surrounded by the _prostate  gland_. The secretion of this gland is conveyed into the urethra by  numerous short ducts, known as the _prostatic ducts_. Behind the  prostate, at the base or fundus of bladder, are the paired _seminal  vesicles_. The duct of the seminal vesicle joins the _vas deferens_ of  the same side (both functionally and embryologically the seminal vesicle  is no more than a diverticulum of the vas deferens); passing on under  the name of the _common seminal_ or _ejaculatory duct_, the canal opens  into the prostatic portion of the urethra (the orifices of the two  common seminal ducts are in the folds of mucous membrane forming the  right and left lateral margins of the _prostatic utricle_ or _uterus  masculinus_). These ducts convey the secretion of the testicles into the  urethra along which canal it passes to the exterior. Behind the  posterior part of the urethra, but distal to the prostate gland, are  situate also the paired _glands of Cowper_, or _suburethral glands_,  whose excretory ducts likewise open into the urethra. There are glands  also in the walls of the seminal vesicles, the vasa deferentia, and the  urethra; the urethral glands are commonly known as the _glands of  Littre_.    As previously mentioned, it is in the testicles that the secretion  necessary for the reproductive act is prepared. This secretion is  evacuated during sexual intercourse, and also during masturbation and  involuntary seminal emissions. The testicular secretion is a tenacious  fluid. When examined microscopically, it is seen to contain countless  spermatozoa, structures about 50 [Greek: m] (1/500 inch) in length, with  a thick head and a long filiform tail. They represent the male  reproductive cells, which during coitus are introduced into the interior  of the female reproductive organs; a single spermatozoon unites with the  ovum of the female to form the fertilised ovum. The spermatozoa are  formed in the walls of the convoluted seminiferous tubules. The cells  lining these tubules are of several different kinds (although in  childhood they are not differentiated as they are after the puberal  development has taken place). One variety of these cells, the  _spermatogonia_, undergo an increase of size at puberty, and from these  spermatogonia, after passing through several intermediate transitional  stages, the spermatozoa are formed.    It was formerly believed that the sole function of the testicles was the  production of the spermatozoa; recently, however, the opinion has gained  ground that these organs have in addition another specific function,  that of internal secretion. Whilst the spermatogonia become transformed  into spermatozoa, other cellular structures of the testicle, more  especially the interstitial cells, produce, it is assumed, the internal  secretion of the gland. The constituents of this internal secretion,  having been poured into the general circulation, are supposed to give  rise to the specific masculine sexual development, and, in particular,  to lead to the appearance of the secondary sexual characters. This  matter will subsequently be discussed in detail, and here I shall merely  add that perhaps none of the proper constituents of the internal  secretion find their way into the external secretion of the testicle.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#6)"],[1,"journey, combined with vexation and disappointment, brought on a fever,  which terminated fatally. He died on November 15, 1630, when in the  sixtieth year of his age, and was interred in St. Peter's churchyard,  Ratisbon.    Kepler was a man of indomitable energy and perseverance, and spared  neither time nor trouble in the accomplishment of any object which he  took in hand. In thinking over the form of the orbits of the planets, he  writes: 'I brooded with the whole energy of my mind on this  subject--asking why they are not other than they are--the number, the  size, and the motions of the orbits.' But many fanciful ideas passed  through Kepler's imaginative brain before he hit upon the true form of  the planetary orbits. In his 'Mysterium Cosmographicum' he asserts that  the five kinds of regular polyhedral solids, when described round one  another, regulated the distances of the planets and size of the  planetary orbits. In support of this theory he writes as follows: 'The  orbit of the Earth is the measure of the rest. About it circumscribe a  dodecahedron. The sphere including this will be that of Mars. About  Mars' orbit describe a tetrahedron; the sphere containing this will be  Jupiter's orbit. Round Jupiter's describe a cube; the sphere including  this will be Saturn's. Within the Earth's orbit inscribe an icosahedron;  the sphere inscribed in it will be Venus's orbit. In Venus inscribe an  octahedron; the sphere inscribed in it will be Mercury's.'    The above quotation is an instance of Kepler's wild and imaginative  genius, which ultimately led him to make those sublime discoveries  associated with planetary motion which are known as 'Kepler's Laws.'    He describes himself as 'troublesome and choleric in politics and  domestic matters;' but in his relations with scientific men he was  affable and pleasant. He showed no jealousy of a rival, and was always  ready to recognise merit in others; nor did he hesitate to acknowledge  any error of his own when more recent discoveries proved that he was  wrong.    Some of his works contain passages, written in a jocular strain,  indicative of a bright and cheerful temperament. The following  characteristic paragraph refers to the opinions of the Epicureans with  regard to the appearance of a new star, which they ascribed to a  fortuitous concourse of atoms: 'When I was a youth, with plenty of idle  time on my hands, I was much taken with the vanity, of which some grown  men are not ashamed, of making anagrams by transposing the letters of my  name written in Latin so as to make another sentence. Out of Ioannes  Keplerus came _Serpens in akuleo_ (a serpent in his sting); but not  being satisfied with the meaning of these words, and being unable to  make another, I trusted the thing to chance, and, taking out of a pack  of playing-cards as many as there were letters in the name, I wrote one  upon each, and then began to shuffle them, and at each shuffle to read  them in the order they came, to see if any meaning came of it. Now, may  all the Epicurean gods and goddesses confound this same chance, which,  although I have spent a good deal of time over it, never showed me  anything like sense, even from a distance. So I gave up my cards to the  Epicurean eternity, to be carried away into infinity; and it is said  they are still flying about there, in the utmost confusion, among the  atoms, and have never yet come to any meaning. I will tell those  disputants, my opponents, not my own opinion, but my wife's. Yesterday,  when weary with writing, and my mind quite dusty with considering these  atoms, I was called to supper, and a salad I had asked for was set  before me. \"It seems, then,\" said I aloud, \"that if pewter dishes,  leaves of lettuce, grains of salt, drops of water, vinegar and oil, and  slices of egg, had been flying about in the air from all eternity, it  might at last happen by chance that there would come a salad.\" \"Yes,\"  says my wife, \"but not so nice and well dressed as this of mine is.\"'    Notwithstanding the frequent interruptions which, owing to various  reasons, retarded his labours, Kepler was able to bring to a successful  completion the numerous and important works upon which he was engaged  during his lifetime, the voluminous nature of which may be imagined when  it is stated that he published thirty-three separate works, besides  leaving behind twenty-two volumes of manuscript.    During his researches on the motions of Mars, Kepler discovered that the  planet sometimes travelled at an accelerated rate of speed, and at  another time its pace was diminished. At one time he observed it to be  in advance of the place where he calculated it should be found, and at  another time it was behind it. This caused him considerable perplexity,  and, feeling convinced in his mind that the form of the planet's orbit  could not be circular, he was compelled to turn his attention to some  other closed curve, by which those inequalities of motion could be  explained.    After years of careful observation and study, Kepler arrived at the  conclusion that the form of the planet's orbit is an ellipse, and that  the Sun occupies one of the foci. He afterwards determined that the  orbits of all the planets are of an elliptical form.    Having discovered the true form of the planetary orbits, Kepler next  endeavoured to ascertain the cause which regulates the unequal motion  that a planet pursues in its path. He observed that when a planet  approached the Sun its motion was accelerated, and as it receded from  him its pace became slower.    This he explained in his next great discovery by proving that an  imaginary line, or radius-vector, extending from the centre of the Sun  to the centre of the planet 'describes equal areas in equal times.' When  near the Sun, or at perihelion, a planet traverses a larger portion of  its arc in the same period of time than it does when at the opposite  part of its orbit, or when at aphelion; but, as the areas of both are  equal, it follows that the planet does not always maintain the same rate  of speed, and that its velocity is greatest when nearest the Sun, and  least when most distant from him.    By the application of his first and second laws Kepler was able to  formulate a third law. He found that there existed a remarkable  relationship between the mean distances of the planets and the times in  which they complete their revolutions round the Sun, and discovered  'that the squares of the periodic times are to each in the same  proportion as the cubes of the mean distances.' The periodic time of a  planet having been ascertained, the square of the mean distance and the  mean distance itself can be obtained. It is by the application of this  law that the distances of the planets are usually calculated.    These discoveries are known as Kepler's Laws, and are usually classified  as follows:--    1. 'The orbit described by every planet is an ellipse, of which the  centre of the Sun occupies one of the foci.    2. 'Every planet moves round the Sun in a plane orbit, and the  radius-vector, or imaginary line joining the centre of the planet and  the centre of the Sun, describes equal areas in equal times.    3. 'The squares of the periodic times of any two planets are  proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.'[1]    These remarkable discoveries do not embrace all the achievements by  which Kepler has immortalised his name, and earned for himself the proud  title of 'Legislator of the Heavens;' he predicted transits of Mercury  and Venus, made important discoveries in optics, and was the inventor of  the astronomical telescope.    GALILEO GALILEI, the famous Italian astronomer and philosopher, and the  contemporary of Kepler and of Milton, was born at Pisa on February 15,  1564.    His father, who traced his descent from an ancient Florentine family,  was desirous that his son should adopt the profession of medicine, and  with this intention he entered him as a student at the University of  Pisa. Galileo, however, soon discovered that the study of mathematics  and mechanical science possessed a greater attraction for his mind,  and, following his inclinations, he resolved to devote his energies to  acquiring proficiency in those subjects.    In 1583 his attention was attracted by the oscillation of a brass lamp  suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral at Pisa. Galileo was  impressed with the regularity of its motion as it swung backwards and  forwards, and was led to imagine that the pendulum movement might prove  a valuable method for the correct measurement of time. The practical  application of this idea he afterwards adopted in the construction of an  astronomical clock.    Having become proficient in mathematics, Galileo, whilst engaged in  studying the writings of Archimedes, wrote an essay on 'The Hydrostatic  Balance,' and composed a treatise on 'The Centre of Gravity in Solid  Bodies.' The reputation which he earned by these contributions to  science procured for him the appointment of Lecturer on Mathematics at  the University of Pisa. Galileo next directed his attention to the works  of Aristotle, and made no attempt to conceal the disfavour with which he  regarded many of the doctrines taught by the Greek philosopher; nor had  he any difficulty in exposing their inaccuracies. One of these, which  maintained that the heavier of two bodies descended to the earth with  the greater rapidity, he proved to be incorrect, and demonstrated by  experiment from the top of the tower at Pisa that, except for the  unequal resistance of the air, all bodies fell to the ground with the  same velocity.    As the chief expounder of the new philosophy, Galileo had to encounter  the prejudices of the followers of Aristotle, and of all those who  disliked any innovation or change in the established order of things.
