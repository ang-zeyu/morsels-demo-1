In the most careful applications of this principle, it is inevitable  that wrong is done sometimes; but when the wrong is not personal, it is  for the most part susceptible of remedy. The author may challenge  investigation of his book, the artist of his picture, the officer of his  administration. If there has been unfair severity of criticism, they are  likely to gain by it in the end, for every critic must justify upon  challenge.    There is a distinction in the cases of the dead. The world in an  especial manner becomes the heir of a life which is abandoned by its  master. This has been held by the wise in all ages and all states of  society. The justice of the distinction is very apparent: An invasion of  the individualism of the living destroys, or to a greater or less extent  affects, the freedom, and so the right and wrong, of his conduct, while  the secrets of the dead are to the living only as logic.    There are very few men who are not more willing to praise than to blame.  The better portion of men prefer to hear the praises even of strangers.  Therefore censors are held to stricter account than eulogists. But a  natural love of justice is continually at war with feelings of personal  kindness. It is impossible to see insolent and vulgar pretension in  noisy triumph, while real and unobtrusive merit is neglected. When we  see a creature strutting in laurels that have been won by another, human  nature--much as it has been abused--prompts us to grasp them from  undeserving brows and place them where they will have a natural grace.  For trite examples, who would not rather elect Columbus than Americus to  the place of Name-Giver for this continent? who does not rejoice that  finally Hadley is proved a swindler of the fame of Godfrey, in the  matter of the quadrant? How many such wrongs do men daily hope to see  righted!    The writer of these paragraphs will never willingly violate the just  conditions of criticism. If he offers, as often is necessary,  conclusions rather than arguments, he will in no case withhold arguments  when conclusions are held to be unjust. The true value of every sort of  journalism, and of discussion also, is in its integrity much more than  in its ability. Integrity is violated as much by the suppression of  truth as by the suggestion of falsehood. In all cases that interest us  sufficiently, and which are legitimately before the public, we shall  write precisely as we think, without the slightest regard for  consequences.           *       *       *       *       *    OERSTED, the great natural philosopher, has lately published at Leipzic,  under the title of _Der in Geist in der Natur_ (Spirit in Nature), a  collection of remarkable essays which he has written, at various times,  during a series of years. The purpose he has followed through his entire  scientific career, has, perhaps, its most complete expression in this  book. It is the demonstration of the same laws in physical nature as in  the higher spheres of the reason and intelligence. On the principle of  the essential unity of all things, he seeks not only to lay the  foundation of a universal science, but to afford some views of the  superstructure. The work contains eight distinct essays: the first, \"The  Spiritual in the Corporeal,\" is in the form of a Dialogue, and aims at a  reconciliation of the conflicting modes of thought, by which the  universe is assumed to be essentially material, or essentially  spiritual; the second, \"The Fountain,\" treats of the impressions of  beauty produced by the great, sublime, and powerful; the third considers  the relation to the imagination, of the apprehension of nature by the  understanding, and shows that it is only imperfect culture and ignorance  which can suppose any dissonance between the two. He shows that the  progress of science enriches, aggrandizes, and elevates the imagination.  The fourth essay is, perhaps, the most interesting of all. Its theme is,  \"Superstition and Skepticism in their relation to Natural Science.\" The  notion that superstition is favorable to poesy, he dissipates with  masterly conclusiveness. The true realm of beauty is the realm of  reason. It is true that science deprives the poet of the use of sundry  unnatural conceptions, but while it more than compensates him by the  substitution of nobler ideas, it opens to him a new, affluent, and  little explored poetic world. \"It can,\" he says, \"not be charged as a  crime upon natural science, that it has destroyed materials hitherto  used by the poets. Such losses are of small consequence to the true  poet, but may, indeed, be painful to the many dabblers in the poetic  art, who think they have rendered the insignificant poetic by tricking  it out in gewgaws from the poetic armory of a vanished era.\" The fifth,  entitled, \"The Existence of all things in the Domain of Reason,\" is the  profoundest and most significant of these essays, and more than the  others brings out in form as simple and popular as could be expected,  the fundamental idea of the author's system of thought. It asserts that  there is, throughout the universe, a radical unity between the laws of  beauty, and man's moral nature and intellectual powers, and that there  must therefore exist for the mind, a perfect community of nature and  analogy between different worlds, and a rational connection between all  thinking beings, not only of the earth, but of other planets and  systems. The final essay is on \"The Culture of Science as the Exercise  of Religion,\" and is mainly an attempt to show that the very nature of  science requires its culture to be made a religion, and that _the good  which we ought to seek must be that which is imperishable in its truth_.    This work has been rapidly followed by two other publications of the  same author, intended to explain or defend the positions of their  predecessor. The first is called, \"Natural Science in its Connection  with Poetic Art and Religion.\" It was written in reply to the criticism  of a learned and respected friend of the author, Bishop Mynster of  Seeland. The second has for its title, \"Natural Science and the  Formation of the Intellect.\"    Oersted is now seventy-three years old. It is admirable to see a man of  such years and distinction in the world, putting forth the same grand  and elevated ideas that marked the generous enthusiasm of his youth. It  is only in the genial and unselfish pursuits of science that such  freshness of mind can be thus preserved.           *       *       *       *       *    NEW DRAMAS.--Among the new dramas of any value, produced in Germany,  _Herodes und Mariamne_, a five act tragedy, by Hebbel, deserves  particular mention. The persons are too numerous, and the action too  complicated, but there is great fire and energy in the general  treatment, and the gradual development of the interest of the story is  managed with skill. Herod, the ruler of Judea, is a tyrant by both  nature and position. He was appointed to his office by the Roman  triumvir Antony, who can turn him out or cut his head off at any moment,  and who is strongly inclined to follow the urgent solicitations of  Herod's many enemies. In order to secure himself, Herod has married  Mariamne, a descendant of the Jewish royal family, and is deeply in love  with her. The chief of his foes is Mariamne's mother; the Pharisees also  hate him for his notorious disregard of the Jewish religion. A  conspiracy is formed against him, at the head of which is the brother of  Mariamne. This brother is killed in consequence, and Herod is summoned  before the triumvir. Meanwhile, as soon as the murder was known,  Mariamne had refused to see her husband. But the evidences of his  attachment are still so convincing, and her admiration for the force of  his character so great, that she becomes reconciled to him. He is about  to leave her to appear before Antony, and asks if her love is great  enough for her to commit suicide, in case he should not return. Finally  he asks her to take an oath to that effect. But she refuses, saying that  such an oath would give him no pledge that he might not have already  from insight into her heart. He is not content with this, and before he  leaves, engages an assassin to kill her in case Antony should put him to  death. After his departure, Mariamne declares to her mother that in case  Herod perishes, she has determined to kill herself. The report arrives  that he has been executed; and the assassin appears; from his bearing  Mariamne guesses the truth, and draws from him a confession. Just as she  is in the deepest agitation at this discovery, the king appears, having  been acquitted by Antony. She meets him with coldness, and at once lets  him know that she has learned all. He puts to death the man, but at the  same time a suspicion arises in his mind that Mariamne has discovered  the secret by betraying her honor. Against this her pride will not allow  her to defend herself. A second trial soon arrives. Herod receives the  order--shortly before the battle of Actium--to go on a dangerous  military expedition for Antony. He now requires no oath, at which she  rejoices; for she still loves him, and forgives him for the past. But  she does not reveal herself to him. He misunderstands the joy which she  cannot conceal, as satisfaction at his departure, and charges a faithful  servant to put her to death in case he shall fall. The report of his  death is renewed, but the appointed assassin, revolted at his office,  discloses all to Mariamne. This drives her to despair. She is confident  that her husband will soon return, and determines that he shall be led  to put her to death unjustly. Accordingly she gives a splendid feast, as  she says,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#6)"],[1,"Military  Secretary), Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry Rawlinson, and Captains Brooke  and Lyon, aides-de-camp, was proceeding on his journey to Ladysmith. The  principal British camps were situated near Glencoe Junction and  Ladysmith, and around these some twelve or fifteen thousand Boers were  reported to be stationed between Sandspruit, Volksrust, and  Wakkerstroom, while on the western side the Natal border was threatened  by the Orange Free State's forces, which were posted in the  neighbourhood of Van Reenen's Pass.    A Proclamation, signed by Sir Alfred Milner and Mr. Schreiner, was  issued in Cape Town, warning British subjects of their duty to the  Queen, while at the same time the German Consul-General officially  ordered his countrymen to remain neutral. A similar warning was given by  the German Consul to Germans in Johannesburg. Preparations were made for  the immediate landing of a Naval Brigade from the British battleships in  Simon's Bay, and volunteers of all kinds hurried to tender their  services for special corps. In Pretoria a further manifesto was issued,  calling on Afrikanders to resist the British demands, and accusing Lord  Salisbury, Mr. Chamberlain, and Sir Alfred Milner of pursuing a  \"criminal policy.\" It also declared that it was perfectly clear that the  desire and object of Great Britain was to deprive the Transvaal Republic  of its independence on account of the gold-mining industry on the Rand.    The manifesto went on to say that Great Britain had offered two  alternatives--a five years' franchise or war. It pointed out that the  difference between the two Governments of two years in the matter of the  franchise had been considered as a sufficient justification for Her  Majesty's Government to endeavour to swallow up the Republics, and it  reminded the Afrikanders that God would assuredly defend the right.    The manifesto was signed \"Francois Willem Reitz, Secretary of State.\" It  created a profound sensation, and a million copies were printed in Dutch  and English.    By this time General Viljoen, in command of the Free State artillery,  was marching towards Albertina, and a party of Boers was encroaching on  the Natal border near Berg. Newcastle was warned that a state of war had  begun. It was abandoned by the British, and taken possession of by the  Boers, while Mafeking held itself in readiness to withstand the enemy.  At Sandspruit the Boers were scattered in various camps over a wide  area, and on the Portuguese border the Barberton and Lydenburg  commandoes were concentrating. Terrified refugees were still fleeing to  the Cape in such large numbers that it was almost impossible to find  accommodation for them, and large sums of money were being subscribed  both there and in Great Britain for the relief of the unhappy exiles.  Mr. Rhodes, as usual, gave munificently in aid of the sufferers, and Sir  Alfred Milner exerted himself to save the unhappy victims of British and  Boer disagreement from destitution. The treatment that these poor  persons received from the Boers in the course of their journey caused  intense indignation, and profound sympathy was felt for the homeless  ones who thus suddenly had been cast adrift from domestic comfort to  complete poverty.    It was now believed that, following the precedent of 1881, an attempt  would be made to isolate Mafeking and Kimberley, and carry on irregular  sieges at these places. The enemy's forces on the northern frontier of  Natal were estimated at some 13,000 men, while at Mafeking and Kimberley  they were supposed to number some three thousand each. On the east, the  seaport of Lorenzo Marques now sprung into great importance, and the  supposed neutralisation of the harbour was effected.    On the 11th of October Mr. Coningham Greene, the British Agent in  Pretoria, left that place for Cape Town; and on the 14th General Sir  Redvers Buller, as Commander-in-chief of the British forces engaged  against the Boer Republics, started from England. The state of war had  commenced in earnest. The Boers in hot haste began to issue further  Proclamations, and President Steyn continued to call on his Burghers to  \"stand up as one man against the oppressor and violator of rights.\"  Twenty-four hours later they were over the border, tearing up railway  lines and severing telegraph wires, and thus cutting off communication  between Mafeking, Vryburg, Rhodesia, and Cape Colony. The investment of  Kimberley was imminent, but it was generally believed that the Diamond  City was strong enough to hold its own till our troops should come to  the rescue. The First Brigade of the Army Service Corps started on the  20th of October from Southampton, the second left on the following day,  and the third sailed on Sunday the 22nd. About the same time the  Canadian Government decided to contribute 1000 men for service in South  Africa, and the New Zealand Contingent sailed for the Cape.    [Illustration: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR--THE DRAKENBERG MOUNTAINS WHERE THE  BOERS WERE LAAGERED.]    In spite of the energetic movements that were suddenly set on foot, a  few pessimists ventured to declare that we would be bound to reap the  results of our previous unpreparedness, and that in consequence of our  procrastination and the weakness of the Government in not having taken  the initiative and allowed us to mobilise earlier, the Boers would get a  good six weeks' start--a loss it would be hard for the best tacticians  or the finest fighting men in the world to retrieve. But the mouths of  the grumblers were silenced. Every one was convinced that the fate of  the nation was perfectly safe in the hands of Sir Redvers Buller and Mr.  Thomas Atkins, and, so convinced, thousands upon thousands flocked to  see them off, and roared their God-speed with cheery British lungs,  albeit with sad and anxious hearts.                             THE OCCUPATION OF DUNDEE    Late in September a force consisting of two battalions of infantry, a  regiment of cavalry, and two field-batteries was hurriedly pushed  forward to occupy Dundee. Affairs between the British and the Boers were  nearing a crisis. It was beginning to be believed that the Dutchmen  meant to take the initiative and strike a blow against our supremacy in  South Africa, though some at home were still shilly-shallying with  sentimental arguments as to the propriety of fighting our \"brother Boer\"  at all. As we now know, it wanted but the smallest move on the part of  the British to bring things to a head. Large commandoes were gathered  together with a rapidity which would have been marvellous had the Boers  not designedly brought about the issue of war, and the frontier of the  northern angle of Natal was threatened. Dundee is an important  coal-mining centre situated some forty-eight miles north-east of  Ladysmith. Why it was chosen as our advance post is hard to decide. Its  communications with Ladysmith were open to attack from either flank,  and, in the light of after events, we see that the position there of a  detached force was highly precarious. General Sir George White in an  official despatch thus describes his action in the matter:--    \"Since my arrival in the Colony I had been much impressed by the exposed  situation of the garrison of Glencoe, and on the evening of October 10 I  had an interview on the subject with his Excellency the Governor, at  which I laid before him my reasons for considering it expedient, from a  military point of view, to withdraw that garrison, and to concentrate  all my available troops at Ladysmith. After full discussion his  Excellency recorded his opinion that such a step would involve grave  political results and possibilities of so serious a nature that I  determined to accept the military risk of holding Dundee as the lesser  of two evils. I proceeded in person to Ladysmith on October 11, sending  on Lieutenant-General Sir William Penn Symons to take command at  Glencoe.    \"The Boers crossed the frontier both on the north and west on October  12, and next day the Transvaal flag was hoisted at Charlestown. My great  inferiority in numbers necessarily confined me strategically to the  defensive, but tactically my intention was, and is, to strike vigorously  whenever opportunity offers.\"    Everything at this juncture depended on the rapidity with which our army  at home could be mobilised and sent to the Cape, and though we took to  ourselves some credit for the energy displayed by all concerned, we were  really scarcely up to date in the matter of activity. For instance, in  1859 it took only thirty-seven days for France to collect on the river Po  a force of 104,000 men, with 12,000 more in Italy, while in 1866 the  Prussian army, numbering 220,000 men, were placed on the frontiers of  Saxony and Silesia in a fortnight. But more expeditious still was Germany  in 1870. In nine days she was able to mobilise her forces, and in eight  more to send to the French frontier an army of 400,000 soldiers and 1200  guns! We had, it is true, to ship off our troops a distance of some 8000  miles, but, without counting this--a natural disadvantage--there were  others--many others, the upshot of red-tapism--to be contended with. This  Sir George White was beginning to feel, but his sufferings in regard to  the initial delay were threefold later on.    To return to Dundee. It was maintained both by the Government and the  people of Natal that the valuable coal supply should be protected, and  an attempt was therefore made to guard it. The misfortune was that from  the first Lieutenant-General Sir W. Penn Symons--who, before the arrival  of Sir George White, commanded in Natal--seemed to be ill acquainted  with the enormous forces that the Boers could bring to bear against him.  It was true that he could not at that time be certain, any more than  appeared to be the Government at home, that the Free Staters would join  the Republicans; but to any one acquainted with "]]]
