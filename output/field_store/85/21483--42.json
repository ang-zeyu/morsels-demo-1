But the captain levelled his piece at a very large one, that had rested  on the top of a tree, after having fatigued us a long time in pursuing  him; this kind of menace, of which the animal, perhaps, recollected his  having sometimes seen the consequences, terrified him to such a degree,  that he fell down motionless at our feet, and we had no difficulty in  seizing him; but when he recovered from his stupor, it required all our  dexterity and efforts to keep him. We tied his paws together; but he  bit so furiously, that we were under the necessity of binding our  handkerchiefs over his head.\"    The common baboon is very numerous in Siam, where they frequently sally  forth in astonishing multitudes to attack the villages, during the time  the peasants are occupied in the rice harvest, and plunder their  habitations of whatever provisions they can lay their paws on. Fruits,  corn, and roots, are their usual food, although they will also eat  flesh. When hunted, baboons often make very formidable resistance to  dogs--their great strength and long claws enabling them to make a stout  defence; and it is with difficulty a single dog can overcome them,  except when they are gorged with excessive eating, in which they always  indulge when they can.    Some years ago, Mr. Rutter, doing duty at the castle of Cape Town, kept  a tame baboon for his amusement. One evening it broke its chain unknown  to him. In the night, climbing up into the belfry, it began to play  with, and ring the bell. Immediately the whole place was in an uproar,  some great danger being apprehended. Many thought that the castle was  on fire; others, that an enemy had entered the bay; and the soldiers  began actually to turn out, when it was discovered that the baboon had  occasioned the disturbance. On the following morning, a court-martial  was summoned, when Cape justice dictated, that, \"Whereas Master  Rutter's baboon had unnecessarily put the castle into alarm, the master  should receive fifty lashes;\" Mr. Rutter, however, found means to evade  the punishment.    The following circumstance is characteristic of the imitative  disposition of the baboon: The army of Alexander the Great marched, in  complete battle array, into a country inhabited by great numbers of  these apes, and encamped there for the night. The next morning, when  the army was about to proceed on its march, the soldiers saw, at some  distance, an enormous number of baboons, drawn up in rank and file,  like a small army, with such regularity that the Macedonians, who could  have no idea of such a manoeuvre, imagined at first that it was the  enemy, prepared to receive them.    The ape-catchers of Africa, it is said, take a vessel filled with  water, and wash their hands and face in a situation where they are sure  to be observed by the apes. After having done so, the water is poured  out, and its place supplied by a solution of glue; they leave the spot,  and the apes then seldom fail to come down from their trees, and wash  themselves in the same manner as they have seen the men do before them.  The consequence is, that they glue their eyelashes so fast together,  that they cannot open their eyes, or see to escape from their enemy.    The ape is fond of spirituous liquors, and these are also used for the  purpose of entrapping them. A person places, in their sight, a number  of vessels filled with ardent spirits, pretends to drink, and retires.  The apes, ever attentive to the proceedings of man, descend, and  imitate what they have seen, become intoxicated, fall asleep, and are  thus rendered an easy conquest to their cunning adversaries.    The people of India make the proneness of apes to imitation useful;  for, when they wish to collect cocoa-nuts, and other fruits, they go to  the woods where these grow, which are generally frequented by apes and  monkeys, gather a few heaps, and withdraw. As soon as they are gone,  the apes fall to work, imitate every thing they have seen done; and  when they have gathered together a considerable number of heaps, the  people approach, the apes fly to the trees, and the harvest is conveyed  home.    Apes and monkeys, in many parts of India, are made objects of religious  veneration, and magnificent temples are erected to their honor. In  these countries, they propagate to an alarming extent; they enter  cities in immense troops, and even venture into the houses. In some  places, as in the kingdom of Calicut, the natives find it necessary to  have their windows latticed, to prevent the ingress of these intruders,  who lay hands without scruple upon every eatable within their reach.  There are three hospitals for monkeys in Amadabad, the capital of  Guzerat, where the sick and lame are fed and relieved by medical  attendants.    Bindrabund, a town of Agra, in India, is in high estimation with the  pious Hindoos, who resort to it from the most remote parts of the  empire, on account of its being the favorite residence of the god  Krishna. The town is embosomed in groves of trees, which, according to  the account of Major Thorn, are the residence of innumerable apes,  whose propensity to mischief is increased by the religious respect paid  to them, in honor of Hunaman, a divinity of the Hindoo mythology,  wherein he is characterized under the form of an ape. In consequence of  this degrading superstition, such numbers of these animals are  supported by the voluntary contributions of pilgrims, that no one dares  to resist or molest them. Hence, access to the town is often difficult;  for, should one of the apes take an antipathy against any unhappy  traveller, he is sure to be assailed by the whole community, who follow  him with all the missile weapons they can collect, such as pieces of  bamboo, stones, and dirt, making at the same time a most hideous  howling.    A striking instance of the audacity of the ape, in attacking the human  species, is related by M. Mollien, in his Travels in Africa. A woman,  going with millet and milk to a vessel, from St. Louis, which had been  stopped before a village in the country of Golam, was attacked by a  troop of apes, from three to four feet high; they first threw stones at  her, on which she began to run away; they then ran after her, and,  having caught her, they commenced beating her with sticks, until she  let go what she was carrying. On returning to the village, she related  her adventure to the principal inhabitants, who mounted their horses,  and, followed by their dogs, went to the place which served as a  retreat to this troop of marauders. They fired at them, killed ten, and  wounded others, which were brought to them by the dogs; but several  negroes were severely wounded in this encounter, either by the stones  hurled at them by the apes, or by their bites; the females, especially,  were most furious in revenging the death of their young ones, which  they carried in their arms.    D'Obsonville, speaking of the sacred haunts of apes in different parts  of India, says that, in the course of his travels through that country,  he occasionally went into the ancient temples, in order to rest  himself. He noticed always that several of the apes, which abounded  there, first observed him attentively, then looked inquisitively at the  food which he was about to take, betraying, by their features and  gestures, the great desire which they felt to partake of it with him.  In order to amuse himself upon such occasions, he was generally  provided with a quantity of dried peas; of these he first scattered  some on the side where the leader stood,--for, according to his  account, the apes always obey some particular one as their  leader,--upon which the animal gradually approached nearer, and  gathered them eagerly up. He then held out a handful to the animal;  and, as they seldom meet a person who harbors any hostile intentions  against them, the creature ventured slowly to approach, cautiously  watching, as it seemed, lest any trick might be played upon him. At  length, becoming bolder, he laid hold, with one of his paws, of the  thumb of the hand in which the peas were held out to him, while, with  the other, he carried them to his mouth, keeping his eyes all the while  fixed upon those of M. d'Obsonville.    \"If I happened to laugh,\" he observes, \"or to move myself, the ape  immediately gave over eating, worked his lips, and made a kind of  growling noise, the meaning of which was rendered very intelligible to  me by his long, canine teeth, which he occasionally exhibited. If I  threw some of the peas to a distance from him, he sometimes seemed  pleased to see other apes pick them up; though, at other times, he  grumbled at it, and attacked those who approached too near to me. The  noise which he made, and the apprehensions he showed, though they  might, perhaps, proceed in some measure from his own greediness,  evidently proved, however, that he feared I might take advantage of  their weakness, and so make them prisoners. I also observed, that those  whom he suffered to approach the nearest to me were always the largest  and strongest of the males; the young and the females he obliged to  keep at a considerable distance from me.\"      MONKEYS.    Of this numerous and frolicsome family, there is a great variety in the  hot regions of both continents. In some portions of South America, they  enliven the landscape by their gambols, and make the forests resound  with their cries. They are the smallest and most lively of the  four-handed family, and in all caravans, they are the favorites of  young observers.    _The Fair Monkey._--This is one of the most beautiful of the tribe.

This indication of general activity  enticed me to the top of the latter, whence I had a view of perhaps 8 or  10 animals scattered over the Barrens beyond Little River. Several were  lying down just beyond the summit of a ridge between the river and  Glacier Pond, so that little more than their antlers was visible. With  the idea of finding out how closely I could approach these resting  animals, I waded knee-deep across a rapid about 100 feet in width, and  worked my way up the opposite slope until I once more caught sight of  the tips of several antlers. Under cover of a rock and some dwarf  birches, I crept ahead on hands and knees, with a miniature camera at  the ready. I had arrived within 50 yards when the nearest buck got to  its feet and stood looking at me. In hopes of photographing the rest  while they were still lying down, I rose to my knees and hastily exposed  the last bit of film in the camera. Still there was no immediate  reaction on the part of the Caribou. Fortunately there was a cross wind.  The first buck was so little alarmed that it leisurely sprinkled the  ground. But presently it turned and walked off, presumably giving some  signal of voice or posture (such as an erect tail) to the rest; for they  got to their feet, not the half a dozen I expected, but half a hundred  of them! Though they trotted off toward Windy Bay, they paused within a  hundred yards and turned to stare at me. Several more relieved  themselves as the first buck had done. By this time I saw that some of  the Caribou, including a little fawn, were carrying their tails quite  erect, as an expression of suspicion or a signal of alarm. Evidently a  majority of the band were bucks, but there were some does, with  foot-long horns, and their fawns. On my way back to camp I noticed  several groups of Caribou swimming across Windy Bay; perhaps they  included the very animals I had so recently disturbed.    In the early afternoon it became evident that a further northwesterly  movement was under way along the ridges between camp and Little River.  The animals had doubtless made the passage of the river near its mouth.  I followed some of them to a bog at the upper end of Little River Ridge,  where I began to film several bucks and a lone, inquisitive, one-horned  doe. While the latter was approaching me within a hundred feet, I caught  a movement out of the corner of my eye, and all at once the bog seemed  full of Caribou. There were 75-100 of them, chiefly bucks, and not more  than 50 yards or so distant across the open bog. They presently moved  on, without haste, and ascended the Middle Ridge.    Several hours later about 50 more Caribou passed through this bog. Then  a band of 17 came along, composed chiefly of does and their fawns, with  a couple of young bucks; they did not even turn their heads in my  direction as I stood in the open 50 yards away. Eventually a herd of  about 150 (the largest I saw during the whole season) passed along the  well-worn trails on the summit of the Middle Ridge. It seemed to include  all sexes and ages, with possibly a majority of does and fawns; bringing  up the rear was a limping patriarch with huge antlers, a heavy mane, and  a lingering winter coat.    During the remainder of the afternoon several other groups appeared in  that general area. About 15 individuals descended Little River Ridge  (fig. 2) to the Eastern Bog, but retraced their course after coming  close to several of us; they were mostly does, with four fawns and a few  bucks. Another band, of all ages and sexes and numbering perhaps a  hundred individuals, crossed at the rapid on Little River. The  temperatures that had prevailed during this day's marked migratory  movements varied from about 45° to 50°. They were low enough to keep the  black flies completely in abeyance, and the mosquito season was  virtually over. Although I noticed none of the parasitic flies, possibly  enough of them were present to keep the Caribou moving actively against  a moderate to brisk northerly wind. Now and again a big buck could be  seen fairly jumping out of its skin with the vigor of vibrating its  sides to shake off the tormentors.    On August 25 (the second day of the big movement) I watched and filmed  the pageant of Caribou migration from the southwestern bank of Little  River. The turfy slopes of the Barrens, carpeted with low ericaceous  shrubs, mosses, and reindeer lichens, and dotted here and there with  little thickets of dwarf birch, spruce, and tamarack, stretched  invitingly before me. Temperatures ranging from 40° to 51°, with a brisk  northwest breeze sweeping down the river, happily suppressed most of the  black flies.    The Caribou came along at intervals from the eastward, in bands up to 75  strong, either to make the passage of the river or to continue upstream  along the opposite ridge. A small number might make the crossing in one  or two files, but one of the larger bands might spread out widely in the  shallow rapid. One of the photographs (fig. 7) shows approximately 75  Caribou going divergent ways at this rapid: about 20 passing upstream  along the ridge on the far side, including some pausing to feed on the  low vegetation; 8 or 9 moving down the slope of the ridge to the water's  edge; about 10 bucks, 16 does, and 6 fawns making the passage of the  river; and about 13 arriving on the near shore and pausing to feed. The  adults were able to step across in the swift water, while the fawns swam  part of the way. The bucks were apparently in the minority again on this  day.    One group of some 40 does and fawns, after swimming the river near its  mouth, came hurrying along the ridge in close array directly toward my  station, and did not take alarm until they had arrived within 100 feet.  Then they turned tail and, each with its flag erect, beat a hasty  retreat. The maneuver made a scene of considerable charm and interest.  While I was filming a dozen Caribou in the Eastern Bog from the Middle  Ridge, a stray fawn came up and halted for some seconds within a rod of  me. The bewildered look in its big eyes was comical though pathetic. In  presently dashing on, it passed within a dozen feet.    Late in the afternoon Fred Schweder, Jr., reported about a thousand  Caribou, in various bands up to 100 strong, crossing Little River here  and there a mile or so above its mouth. They were traveling southwest.      August 26 was marked by mist squalls, a maximum temperature of    45°, and a slackening in the numbers of passing Caribou. Late in    the morning a band of more than 30 bucks, does, and fawns    crossed the rapid on Little River. In the early afternoon    scattering individuals and a band of 15 or 20 did likewise.    Presently another band of about 22 animals came (fig. 8); it    consisted chiefly of does and fawns, but there were several    medium-sized bucks bringing up the rear. They crossed the rapid    in a somewhat V-shaped formation, open at the front. The    vanguard reached a rocky strip 25 yards in front of my camera    and began to feed contentedly on the low vegetation. However,    a couple of does still in the water eyed me intently and    presumably communicated their misgivings to the others, for all    turned and went back through the river without panic or haste,    although they trotted on reaching the farther shore. Later there    were about 25 Caribou crossing the bay, and nearly as many on    Little River Ridge.      The weather on August 27, while mostly sunny, included    occasional snow or sleet flurries; the northerly wind was brisk    to strong; and the temperature, ranging from 37° to 50°,    prevented the appearance of black flies. By 10:20 a.m. a band of    about 10 does and fawns crossed the rapid on Little River. Two    hours later 12-15 animals followed the same course, and    presently 75-100 passed upstream on the far side, with a good    deal of grunting. About 2:35 p.m. nearly a hundred Caribou,    perhaps alarmed by a passing plane, dashed north out of the    Eastern Bog. By 4:45 p.m. 20 or more bucks, does, and fawns swam    across Little River at its mouth; several of the biggest bucks,    with enormous antlers, led the advance into the water. An hour    later, on the eastern side of the river, half a dozen of the    animals were lying down, but with heads erect, and facing down    wind. At this period of the day several more bands of moderate    size swam over to the west side of the river. A goodly number of    the animals fed within 25 yards of me for a considerable time.      The following day was nearly cloudless; wind moderate, westerly;    temperature, 37.5° to 66°--high enough to bring out the black    flies (but extremely few mosquitoes) after several days of    virtual freedom from these scourges. Between 11:30 a.m. and 3    p.m. at least 500 Caribou, coming from the east, must have    passed the mouth of Little River, some swimming across at that    point (figs. 9, 12), and others proceeding various distances    upstream before undertaking the passage. A few of the larger    bands numbered approximately 30, 40, and 75 individuals. Some    consisted largely of does and fawns, some of big bucks. One of    the larger bands approached the river on the run, plunged in    recklessly, and landed on the western shore some 30 feet    directly in front of my battery of cameras. Most of the animals    on this and similar occasions were remarkably indifferent to me    as I operated the cameras in full view of them. Some among them    would approach within a rod or less and stare me in the face    without alarm (figs. 11, 14).      August 29 was a cloudy, nearly calm day, with temperatures    ranging from 49.5° to 73°--conditions more propitious for black    flies than for their victims. There was comparatively little    local movement among the Caribou--in the morning"]]]
