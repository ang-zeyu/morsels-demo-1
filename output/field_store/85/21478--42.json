Pennant believes that it was brought over in        merchant-vessels from the East Indies.          It is even supposed, that the old English black rat, as it is        called, is not originally a native of this island, as no mention        is made of it in any author earlier than the middle of the        sixteenth century.          [6] The characters of the teeth, the form of the body, and the        habits of the water-rat, fully justify its removal from the genus        _mus_, to which the common rat belongs, and indicate a pretty        close affinity to the beaver. Linnaeus himself appears struck        with this, for though in his _Systema Naturae_ he has placed the        water-rat in the genus _mus_, in a subsequent work he has removed        it to that of _castor_.    Well, well, we must not expect too much from people who have never had  an opportunity of learning. I could tell you a good deal about this  relation of the water-rat, this clever fellow called the beaver, and  about the famous wooden houses he makes of the trunks and branches of  trees. But I declare I must fly home, and see how Mrs. Leatherwing is  getting on. Oh! stop a minute, though; I forgot one thing. Perhaps  _you_ don't believe that I can run on a level surface, or raise myself  from it, as you may never have seen me do it. Look here, then!    So saying, the funny little creature made what he called a _run_, along  the large branch upon which Brush was seated, and at the end of this  _run_ of two or three feet in length, he gave a sort of a little spring  into the air, and instantly spreading his beautiful wings, he sailed  away from the tree, saying, \"Good bye, Brush! what d'ye think of that,  eh?\"    But the squirrel did not return the farewell, for when he saw the very  ridiculous manner in which his friend shuffled along, while he  performed the feat which he called _running_, he was seized with such a  fit of laughter that he could make no reply, and he was even obliged to  hold fast, lest he should fall off the branch. When he had recovered  from his merriment, he began to talk to himself, in an unusually grave  and moralizing strain.    \"Well, Mr. Leatherwing,\" said he, \"you are an odd fellow, a very odd  little fellow indeed! But I have learned something from you this  evening, besides the information you gave me about those rats. I have  learned that every animal has a different part to perform in the world,  and that we all should be content with our situations, and not attempt  to do things for which we were never intended. Now I suppose nobody  will deny that I can run and leap famously, so that I am quite at home  among the boughs of this beautiful oak; but I cannot fly at all, and I  believe I should be a very poor swimmer. Then there is my neighbour,  the water-rat, who can both dive and swim like a fish, but he can no  more fly than myself, and I am sure he cannot leap half so well. As for  old Leatherwing, the _air_ is for him, and most delightful it must be  to fly and sail about as he does. But then he must be content with  _flying only_, for I think he would be much worse off in the water than  I should, and when he attempts to run or to leap--Ha! ha! what fun! I  must go and tell Mrs. Brush all about that.\"          CHAPTER V.      The important event upon which Leatherwing had been in such haste to  congratulate his friend, really took place in two days after the  conversation just related. In other words, the joys and cares of our  squirrels were increased by the presence of four young ones, as fine  healthy little creatures as their hearts could desire. And I am sure  that more attentive and affectionate parents than Brush and his  companion could not be found, even among the human race. For many days  they made a point of never leaving the nest at the same time, for fear  their tender family should suffer for want of their parents' warmth and  protection. And though Brush was naturally such a playful rattling  fellow, you might have observed some difference in his behaviour, since  he became the father of four helpless children. I mean, that he spent  less time in play, and seldom rambled to any great distance from the  oak-tree. So for a week or two our squirrels passed their time very  sedately and quietly, taking care of their children, and watching with  great delight their rapid growth from day to day.    One evening, just before bed-time, Brush was peering out at the  entrance of his hole, as he often did before he curled himself up for  the night, perhaps that he might see what sort of weather it was likely  to be the next day. Whatever his object might have been, he certainly  _was_ looking out of his hole on this particular evening; when, casting  his eyes down the valley, he perceived a small dark speck dancing about  in the air, and as it drew nearer, and became more distinct, he saw  that it was his friend Leatherwing, coming to enjoy his favourite sport  of gnat-catching, over the surface of the pond.    \"I feel rather sleepy,\" said Brush, \"but I have not seen the old fellow  for some time, and I _must_ tell him what has happened since he was  here last.\"    So he ran out to the end of a branch, and when the bat came within hail  he begged him to stop for a few minutes' chat.    Now, though Leatherwing was very hungry, and his game was abundant, yet  his love of a little gossip was so great, that it overcame his dislike  to the feeling of an empty stomach, and he was just going to alight on  the branch, by the side of his friend, when he suddenly called out in a  voice of extreme terror, \"Back, friend Brush! Run back to your hole  directly! Back, you foolish fellow, or the cruel wild-cat will have  you!\"    [Illustration: THE WILD-CAT. Page 99.]    Horrible! the monstrous wild-cat, the British tigress as she has been  called, was in the tree indeed! She was crouching down on a  neighbouring branch, between the squirrel and the nest, preparing  herself for the fearful spring, by that peculiar wriggling motion of  the hinder part of the body which you may often have observed in your  favourite kitten, when she is just going to dart at the plaything you  have kindly made for her amusement.    At first sight of the monster, the poor little squirrel was so  terrified that he had no power to move, for her great savage eyes were  fixed upon him, and sent forth a horrible greenish coloured light,  which seemed to have the effect of preventing any attempt at escape.  But he recovered himself at last, and it was well for him that he did  so; for hardly, by means of a tremendous spring, had he reached a  distant bough, when his fierce pursuer, who must have leaped at the  same instant, alighted on the very spot he had just quitted. And now  between these two animals, so unequally matched in strength and size,  you might have seen a most exciting and hardly contested race; the  squirrel doing his utmost to secure his safety, by reaching his hole,  and the wild-cat following with terrible eagerness, in hopes of  obtaining a most delicate and favourite morsel for her supper. Had they  both started fairly, I think that the fierce beast would have had no  chance of overtaking her prey; but, as I have mentioned, she was  between the squirrel and his fortress when the chase began, so that he  could not run at once to his only place of refuge.    Poor Brush! he was hardly pressed indeed, and several times, when he  found his retreat to his hole cut off, he gave himself up for lost.  He owed his safety at last, not to his wonderful agility alone, but  also to his _lightness_, which enabled him to pass over the smaller  branches that would have bent or broken with the weight of his enemy.  To keep you no longer in suspense, you must know, then, that the poor  breathless terrified squirrel reached his hole at last, and no sooner  was he safe within it, than an immense paw, furnished with terribly  sharp, hooked claws, was thrust in as far as it could reach, and Brush  could see the light of those horrid, yellow-green eyes, gleaming in  upon him through the narrow opening. He even fancied he could smell her  hot tainted breath, as she growled with rage and disappointment.    \"Baulked, Mrs. Wild-cat! Exactly three seconds too late, Mrs. Tabby!  Yes, Madam, if you had reached the hole only three seconds earlier, you  would have made a very nice supper of poor Brush, and his nest would  that night have contained a sorrowful widow and four fatherless  children. A little too late, I am happy to say, Mrs. Tabby! Only a very  little too late, but 'a miss is as good as a mile,' as people say.  What! you are in a terrible rage now, are you? And you will growl, and  spit, and try to thrust your great ugly head into a hole only just  large enough for the slender body of Brush to pass easily through it.  There! you may do your worst, and when you have tired yourself, you may  go and look for a supper elsewhere, only I cannot possibly wish that  good luck may attend upon your hunting. One thing I _squirrels_ wish  though, that Harvey was under the tree just now with his gun. Well,  never mind! Your time will come, I dare say.\"    Yes, the squirrel had escaped from his terrible enemy for that time. He  and his family were safe as long as they remained in their castle, and  they had still sufficient food in their hoard to stand a pretty long  siege, though I cannot tell what they would have done for want of  water. But then how miserable it would be, to be kept close prisoners  for days, or even weeks; for how could they ever be certain that their  enemy was not still in the neighbourhood, or perhaps lying in wait for  them behind some branch of their own oak-tree? Truly a very pitiable  situation indeed!    It is wonderful how we become accustomed to dangers of all kinds, and  yet those who have often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33502"],[0,"My Knitting Book (#6)"],[1,"forward, slip one;  knit two together, pass the slip-stitch over them; bring the silk  forward, knit four.--Repeat.    _Second round_--pearl two; knit two; knit two together; bring the silk  forward, knit three; bring the silk forward, knit two together, taken at  the back.--Repeat.    _Third round_--pearl two; knit one; knit two together; bring the silk  forward, knit five; bring the silk forward, knit two together, taken at  the back; knit one.--Repeat.    _Fourth round_--pearl two; knit two together; bring the silk forward,  knit three; bring the silk forward, knit two together; knit two; bring  the silk forward, knit two together, taken at the back.--Repeat.    _Fifth round_--pearl two; knit two; bring the silk forward, knit two  together, taken at the back; knit three; knit two together; bring the  silk forward, knit two.--Repeat.    _Sixth round_--pearl two; knit three; bring the silk forward, knit two  together, taken at the back; knit one; knit two together; bring the silk  forward, knit three.--Repeat.

Commence again, as at first round.          A Bag, with Black or Garnet Beads.      No. 20 needles, eight skeins of netting silk, and four bunches of beads,  including those for the fringe, will be required.    Thread half a bunch of beads on a skein of claret netting silk, and  cast on eighty-eight stitches.    _First and second rows_--plain knitting, without beads.    _Third row_--slip one; knit one with a bead; knit one.--Repeat the same,  alternately, to the end of the row.    Repeat from first row, eighty-four times. Observe at the commencement of  every row to make a slip-stitch.    Join up the two sides, leaving an opening at the top, and finish with  two bars and a gold chain. A fringe of the garnet beads, with gold  points, is the prettiest trimming. It should have a stiff lining.          Knitted Fringe.      This may be made of any sized wool or cotton, according to the purpose  for which it is required; it may also be _spaced_ with two or more  colours, working alternately six rows in each.    Cast on eight stitches.    Knit two; bring the wool forward, knit two together; knit one; bring the  wool forward, knit two together; knit one.    When a sufficient number of rows are knitted to form the length of  fringe desired,--    Cast off five stitches, leaving three to unravel for the fringe.    With four-thread fleecy, No. 10 needles may be used.          Vandyke Border.      This border is generally knitted in cotton, and may be used for muslin  curtains, for knitted or netted fish napkins, and for \"tidies\" for the  backs of chairs, or ends of sofas.    Cast on seven stitches, on No. 17 needles.    _First and second rows_--plain knitting.    _Third row_--slip one; knit two; turn over, knit two together; turn  over twice, knit two together.    _Fourth row_--bring the thread forward, knit two; pearl one; knit two;  turn over, knit two together; knit one.    _Fifth row_--slip one; knit two; turn over, knit two together; knit  four.    _Sixth row_--knit six; turn over, knit two together; knit one.    _Seventh row_--slip one; knit two; turn over, knit two together; turn  over twice, knit two together; turn over twice, knit two together.    _Eighth row_--knit two; pearl one; knit two; pearl one; knit two; turn  over, knit two together; knit one.    _Ninth row_--slip one; knit two; turn over, knit two together; turn over  twice, knit two together; turn over twice, knit two together; turn over  twice, knit two together.    _Tenth row_--knit two; pearl one; knit two; pearl one; knit two; pearl  one; knit two; turn over, knit two together; knit one.    _Eleventh row_--slip one; knit two; turn over, knit two together; knit  nine.    _Twelfth row_--cast off all but seven; knit four; turn over, knit two  together; knit one.    This finishes the first vandyke.--Commence again, as at third row.          A warm Half-square Shawl.      Four-thread fleecy, or eight-thread Zephyr fleecy, of two colours, say  rose and white.--No. 8 needles.    Cast on one stitch, rose colour, and increase at the beginning of every  other row, until there are ten stitches on the needle. In the next  row--knit seven stitches for the border, which is throughout in plain  knitting; join on the white wool, and pearl three, increasing on the  last stitch.    In the next row--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two, pass the  slipped stitch over them; knit the remaining white stitch plain; knit  the seven stitches for the border, twisting the two colours in the  changing of them.    In the next row--knit the seven stitches for the border; pearl the  white, increasing at the end as before.    Repeat the two last rows, which comprise the whole pattern, until the  shawl is of the required size, and finish with the plain knitted border,  to correspond with the other side.    N.B. In the fancy row of the white, when uneven stitches occur at the  end of the row, they are to be knitted plain.          A warm Double Knitted Scarf, in Two Colours.      Cast on thirty-six stitches in blue six-thread fleecy.--No. 2 needles.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; pass the wool back, knit  one, turning the wool twice round the needle.--Repeat to the end of the  row.    Each succeeding row is the same, observing that the knit-stitch always  comes over the slip-stitch.    It will require seven rows of blue, seven of white, seven of blue,  thirty-eight of white, seven of blue, seven of white, and seven of blue.    Cast off and draw up the ends. Finish with blue and white tassels.          A Border for a Shawl or Quilt.      This border should be knitted separate, with the same sized needles and  wool as the shawl or quilt, and afterwards sewn on.    Cast on any even number of stitches.    _First row_--Bring the wool forward, knit two together.    _Second row_--plain knitting.    Repeat these two rows alternately.          Raised Knitting for a Shawl.      Two No. 19 and one No. 13 needles should be used.    Cast on any even number of stitches, that may be required, with German  wool.    _First row_--with the small needle, alternately make one stitch, and  knit two stitches together.    _Second row_--plain knitting, with large needle.    _Third row_--plain knitting, with small needle.    _Fourth row_--pearl knitting, with small needle.    Repeat, from the first row.    This kind of knitting is also well adapted for hoods, muffs, cuffs, etc.  It is very pretty for a shawl in stripes,--knitting three patterns  alternately of each colour. For a shawl, one yard and a half square,  about three hundred and sixty stitches would be required.          A Russian Shawl, in Brioche Stitch.      German wool.--No. 9 needles.    For a shawl one yard and a half square, about three hundred and"]]]
