She recoiled with fright, exclaiming--    \"Commander de Jars!\"    \"On my word!\" said Quennebert behind the arras, \"'tis as amusing as a  play! Is the commander also going to offer to make an honest woman of  her? But what do I see?\"    He had just caught sight of the young man on whom de Jars had bestowed  the title and name of Chevalier de Moranges, and whose acquaintance the  reader has already made at the tavern in the rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts.  His appearance had as great an effect on the notary as a thunderbolt. He  stood motionless, trembling, breathless; his knees ready to give way  beneath him; everything black before his eyes. However, he soon pulled  himself together, and succeeded in overcoming the effects of his  surprise and terror. He looked once more through the hole in the  partition, and became so absorbed that no one in the whole world could  have got a word from him just then; the devil himself might have  shrieked into his ears unheeded, and a naked sword suspended over his  head would not have induced him to change his place.          CHAPTER IV      Before Mademoiselle de Guerchi had recovered from her fright the  commander spoke.    \"As I am a gentleman, my beauty, if you were the Abbess of Montmartre,  you could not be more difficult of access. I met a blackguard on the  stairs who tried to stop me, and whom I was obliged to thrash soundly.  Is what they told me on my return true? Are you really doing penance,  and do you intend to take the veil?\"    \"Sir,\" answered Angelique, with great dignity, \"whatever may be my  plans, I have a right to be surprised at your violence and at your  intrusion at such an hour.\"    \"Before we go any farther,\" said de Jars, twirling round on his heels,  \"allow me to present to you my nephew, the Chevalier de Moranges.\"    \"Chevalier de Moranges!\" muttered Quennebert, on whose memory in that  instant the name became indelibly engraven.    \"A young man,\" continued the commander, \"who has come back with me from  abroad. Good style, as you see, charming appearance. Now, you young  innocent, lift up your great black eyes and kiss madame's hand; I allow  it.\"    \"Monsieur le commandeur, leave my room; begone, or I shall call----\"    \"Whom, then? Your lackeys? But I have beaten the only one you keep, as I  told you, and it will be some time before he'll be in a condition to  light me downstairs: 'Begone,' indeed! Is that the way you receive an  old friend? Pray be seated, chevalier.\"    He approached Mademoiselle de Guerchi, and, despite her resistance,  seized hold of one of her hands, and forcing her to sit down, seated  himself beside her.    \"That's right, my girl,\" said he; \"now let us talk sense. I understand  that before a stranger you consider yourself obliged to appear  astonished at my ways of going on. But he knows all about us, and  nothing he may see or hear will surprise him. So a truce to prudery! I  came back yesterday, but I could not make out your hiding-place till  to-day. Now I'm not going to ask you to tell me how you have gone on in  my absence. God and you alone know, and while He will tell me nothing,  you would only tell me fibs, and I want to save you from that venial sin  at least. But here I am, in as good spirits as ever, more in love than  ever, and quite ready to resume my old habits.\"    Meantime the lady, quite subdued by his noisy entrance and ruffianly  conduct, and seeing that an assumption of dignity would only draw down  on her some fresh impertinence, appeared to resign herself to her  position. All this time Quennebert never took his eyes from the  chevalier, who sat with his face towards the partition. His elegantly  cut costume accentuated his personal advantages. His jet black hair  brought into relief the whiteness of his forehead; his large dark eyes  with their veined lids and silky lashes had a penetrating and peculiar  expression--a mixture of audacity and weakness; his thin and somewhat  pale lips were apt to curl in an ironical smile; his hands were of  perfect beauty, his feet of dainty smallness, and he showed with an  affectation of complaisance a well-turned leg above his ample boots, the  turned down tops of which, garnished with lace, fell in irregular folds  aver his ankles in the latest fashion. He did not appear to be more than  eighteen years of age, and nature had denied his charming face the  distinctive sign of his sex for not the slightest down was visible on  his chin, though a little delicate pencilling darkened his upper lip:  His slightly effeminate style of beauty, the graceful curves of his  figure, his expression, sometimes coaxing, sometimes saucy, reminding  one of a page, gave him the appearance of a charming young scapegrace  destined to inspire sudden passions and wayward fancies. While his  pretended uncle was making himself at home most unceremoniously,  Quennebert remarked that the chevalier at once began to lay siege to his  fair hostess, bestowing tender and love-laden glances on her behind that  uncle's back. This redoubled his curiosity.    \"My dear girl,\" said the commander, \"since I saw you last I have come  into a fortune of one hundred thousand livres, neither more nor less.  One of my dear aunts took it into her head to depart this life, and her  temper being crotchety and spiteful she made me her sole heir, in order  to enrage those of her relatives who had nursed her in her illness. One  hundred thousand livres! It's a round sum--enough to cut a great figure  with for two years. If you like, we shall squander it together, capital  and interest. Why do you not speak? Has anyone else robbed me by any  chance of your heart? If that were so, I should be in despair, upon my  word-for the sake of the fortunate individual who had won your favour;  for I will brook no rivals, I give you fair warning.\"    \"Monsieur le commandeur,\" answered Angelique, \"you forget, in speaking  to me in that manner, I have never given you any right to control my  actions.\"    \"Have we severed our connection?\"    At this singular question Angelique started, but de Jars continued--    \"When last we parted we were on the best of terms, were we not? I know  that some months have elapsed since then, but I have explained to you  the reason of my absence. Before filling up the blank left by the  departed we must give ourselves space to mourn. Well, was I right in my  guess? Have you given me a successor?\"    Mademoiselle de Guerchi had hitherto succeeded in controlling her  indignation, and had tried to force herself to drink the bitter cup of  humiliation to the dregs; but now she could bear it no longer. Having  thrown a look expressive of her suffering at the young chevalier, who  continued to ogle her with great pertinacity, she decided on bursting  into tears, and in a voice broken by sobs she exclaimed that she was  miserable at being treated in this manner, that she did not deserve it,  and that Heaven was punishing her for her error in yielding to the  entreaties of the commander. One would have sworn she was sincere and  that the words came from her heart. If Maitre Quennebert had not  witnessed the scene with Jeannin, if he had not known how frail was the  virtue of the weeping damsel, he might have been affected by her  touching plaint. The chevalier appeared to be deeply moved by  Angelique's grief, and while his, uncle was striding up and down the  room and swearing like a trooper, he gradually approached her and  expressed by signs the compassion he felt.    Meantime the notary was in a strange state of mind. He had not yet made  up his mind whether the whole thing was a joke arranged between de Jars  and Jeannin or not, but of one thing he was quite convinced, the  sympathy which Chevalier de Moranges was expressing by passionate sighs  and glances was the merest hypocrisy. Had he been alone, nothing would  have prevented his dashing head foremost into this imbroglio, in scorn  of consequence, convinced that his appearance would be as terrible in  its effect as the head of Medusa. But the presence of the widow  restrained him. Why ruin his future and dry up the golden spring which  had just begun to gush before his eyes, for the sake of taking part in a  melodrama? Prudence and self-interest kept him in the side scenes.    The tears of the fair one and the glances of the chevalier awoke no  repentance in the breast of the commander; on the contrary, he began to  vent his anger in terms still more energetic. He strode up and down the  oaken floor till it shook under his spurred heels; he stuck his plumed  hat on the side of his head, and displayed the manners of a bully in a  Spanish comedy. Suddenly he seemed to have come to a swift resolution:  the expression of his face changed from rage to icy coldness, and  walking up to Angelique, he said, with a composure more terrible than  the wildest fury--    \"My rival's name?\"    \"You shall never learn it from me!\"    \"Madame, his name?\"    \"Never! I have borne your insults too long. I am not responsible to you  for my actions.\"    \"Well, I shall learn it, in spite of you, and I know to whom to apply.  Do you think you can play fast and loose with me and my love? No, no! I  used to believe in you; I turned, a deaf ear to your traducers. My mad  passion for you became known; I was the jest and the butt of the town.  But you have opened my eyes, and at last I see clearly on whom my  vengeance ought to fall. He was formerly my friend, and I would believe  nothing against him; although I was often warned, I took no notice. But  now I will seek him out, and say to him, 'You have stolen what was mine;  you are a scoundrel! It must be your life, or mine!' And if, there is  justice in heaven, I shall kill him! Well, madame, you don't ask me the  name of this man! You well know whom I mean!\"    This threat brought home to Mademoiselle de Guerchi how imminent was her  danger. At"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#6)"],[1," queen recoiled one step, crimson with astonishment and rage; but  before she could find words to reply, the lady continued in a voice that  betrayed no feeling--    \"I request you to make my son Count of Eboli.\"    \"That has nothing to do with me, madam; the barons of this kingdom would  revolt to a man if I were on my own authority to exalt to one of the  first dignities the son of a---\"    \"A laundress and a negro; you would say, madam?\" said Robert, with a  sneer. \"Bertrand of Artois would be annoyed perhaps if I had a title  like his.\"    He advanced a step towards the bed, his hand upon the hilt of his sword.    \"Have mercy, Robert!\" cried the queen, checking him: \"I will do all you  ask.\"    And she signed the parchment naming him Count of Eboli.    \"And now,\" Robert went on impudently, \"to show that my new title is not  illusory, while you are busy about signing documents, let me have the  privilege of taking part in the councils of the crown: make a  declaration that, subject to your good pleasure, my mother and I are to  have a deliberative voice in the council whenever an important matter is  under discussion.\"    \"Never!\" cried Joan, turning pale. \"Philippa and Robert, you abuse my  weakness and treat your queen shamefully. In the last few days I have  wept and suffered continually, overcome by a terrible grief; I have no  strength to turn to business now. Leave me, I beg: I feel my strength  gives way.\"    \"What, my daughter,\" cried the Catanese hypocritically, \"are you feeling  unwell? Come and lie down at once.\" And hurrying to the bed, she took  hold of the curtain that concealed the Count of Artois.    The queen uttered a piercing cry, and threw herself before Philippa with  the fury of a lioness. \"Stop!\" she cried in a choking voice; \"take the  privilege you ask, and now, if you value your own life, leave me.\"    The Catanese and her son departed instantly, not even waiting to reply,  for they had got all they wanted; while Joan, trembling, ran desperately  up to Bertrand, who had angrily drawn his dagger, and would have fallen  upon the two favourites to take vengeance for the insults they had  offered to the queen; but he was very soon disarmed by the lovely  shining eyes raised to him in supplication, the two arms cast about him,  and the tears shed by Joan: he fell at her feet and kissed them  rapturously, with no thought of seeking excuse for his presence, with no  word of love, for it was as if they had loved always: he lavished the  tenderest caresses on her, dried her tears, and pressed his trembling  lips upon her lovely head. Joan began to forget her anger, her vows, and  her repentance: soothed by the music of her lover's speech, she returned  uncomprehending monosyllables: her heart beat till it felt like  breaking, and once more she was falling beneath love's resistless spell,  when a new interruption occurred, shaking her roughly out of her  ecstasy; but this time the young count was able to pass quietly and  calmly into a room adjoining, and Joan prepared to receive her  importunate visitor with severe and frigid dignity.    The individual who arrived at so inopportune a moment was little  calculated to smooth Joan's ruffled brow, being Charles, the eldest son  of the Durazzo family. After he had introduced his fair cousin to the  people as their only legitimate sovereign, he had sought on various  occasions to obtain an interview with her, which in all probability  would be decisive. Charles was one of those men who to gain their end  recoil at nothing; devoured by raging ambition and accustomed from his  earliest years to conceal his most ardent desires beneath a mask of  careless indifference, he marched ever onward, plot succeeding plot,  towards the object he was bent upon securing, and never deviated one  hair's-breadth from the path he had marked out, but only acted with  double prudence after each victory, and with double courage after each  defeat. His cheek grew pale with joy; when he hated most, he smiled; in  all the emotions of his life, however strong, he was inscrutable. He had  sworn to sit on the throne of Naples, and long had believed himself the  rightful heir, as being nearest of kin to Robert of all his nephews. To  him the hand of Joan would have been given, had not the old king in his  latter days conceived the plan of bringing Andre from Hungary and  re-establishing the elder branch in his person, though that had long  since been forgotten. But his resolution had never for a moment been  weakened by the arrival of Andre in the kingdom, or by the profound  indifference wherewith Joan, preoccupied with other passion, had always  received the advances of her cousin Charles of Durazzo. Neither the love  of a woman nor the life of a man was of any account to him when a crown  was weighed in the other scale of the balance.    During the whole time that the queen had remained invisible, Charles had  hung about her apartments, and now came into her presence with  respectful eagerness to inquire for his cousin's health. The young duke  had been at pains to set off his noble features and elegant figure by a  magnificent dress covered with golden fleur-de-lys and glittering with  precious stones. His doublet of scarlet velvet and cap of the same  showed up, by their own splendour, the warm colouring of his skin, while  his face seemed illumined by his black eyes that shone keen as an  eagle's.    Charles spoke long with his cousin of the people's enthusiasm on her  accession and of the brilliant destiny before her; he drew a hasty but  truthful sketch of the state of the kingdom; and while he lavished  praises on the queen's wisdom, he cleverly pointed out what reforms were  most urgently needed by the country; he contrived to put so much warmth,  yet so much reserve, into his speech that he destroyed the disagreeable  impression his arrival had produced. In spite of the irregularities of  her youth and the depravity brought about by her wretched education,  Joan's nature impelled her to noble action: when the welfare of her  subjects was concerned, she rose above the limitations of her age and  sex, and, forgetting her strange position, listened to the Duke of  Durazzo with the liveliest interest and the kindliest attention. He then  hazarded allusions to the dangers that beset a young queen, spoke  vaguely of the difficulty in distinguishing between true devotion and  cowardly complaisance or interested attachment; he spoke of the  ingratitude of many who had been loaded with benefits, and had been most  completely trusted. Joan, who had just learned the truth of his words by  sad experience, replied with a sigh, and after a moment's silence  added--    \"May God, whom I call to witness for the loyalty and uprightness of my  intentions, may God unmask all traitors and show me my true friends! I  know that the burden laid upon me is heavy, and I presume not on my  strength, but I trust that the tried experience of those counsellors to  whom my uncle entrusted me, the support of my family, and your warm and  sincere friendship above all, my dear cousin, will help me to accomplish  my duty.\"    \"My sincerest prayer is that you may succeed, my fair cousin, and I will  not darken with doubts and fears a time that ought to be given up to  joy; I will not mingle with the shouts of gladness that rise on all  sides to proclaim you queen, any vain regrets over that blind fortune  which has placed beside the woman whom we all alike adore, whose single  glance would make a man more blest than the angels, a foreigner unworthy  of your love and unworthy of your throne.\"    \"You forget, Charles,\" said the queen, putting out her hand as though to  check his words, \"Andre is my husband, and it was my grandfather's will  that he should reign with me.\"    \"Never!\" cried the duke indignantly; \"he King of Naples! Nay, dream that  the town is shaken to its very foundations, that the people rise as one  man, that our church bells sound a new Sicilian vespers, before the  people of Naples will endure the rule of a handful of wild Hungarian  drunkards, a deformed canting monk, a prince detested by them even as  you are beloved!\"    \"But why is Andre blamed? What has he done?\"    \"What has he done? Why is he blamed, madam? The people blame him as  stupid, coarse, a savage; the nobles blame him for ignoring their  privileges and openly supporting men of obscure birth; and I,  madam,\"--here he lowered his voice, \"I blame him for making you  unhappy.\"    Joan shuddered as though a wound had been touched by an unkind hand; but  hiding her emotion beneath an appearance of calm, she replied in a voice  of perfect indifference--    \"You must be dreaming, Charles; who has given you leave to suppose I am  unhappy?\"    \"Do not try to excuse him, my dear cousin,\" replied Charles eagerly;  \"you will injure yourself without saving him.\"    The queen looked fixedly at her cousin, as though she would read him  through and through and find out the meaning of his words; but as she  could not give credence to the horrible thought that crossed her mind,  she assumed a complete confidence in her cousin's friendship, with a  view to discovering his plans, and said carelessly--    \"Well, Charles, suppose I am not happy, what remedy could you offer me  that I might escape my lot?\"    \"You ask me that, my dear cousin? Are not all remedies good when you  suffer, and when you wish for revenge?\"    \"One must fly to those means that are possible. Andre will not readily  give up his pretensions: he has a party of his own, and in case of open  rupture his brother the King of Hungary may declare war upon us, and  bring ruin and desolation upon our kingdom.\"    The Duke of Duras faintly smiled, and his countenance assumed a sinister  expression.    \"You do not understand me,\" he said.    \"Then explain without circumlocution,\" said the queen, trying to conceal  the convulsive shudder that ran through her limbs.    \"Liste"]]]
