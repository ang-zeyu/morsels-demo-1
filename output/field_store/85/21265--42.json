His opponents imagine  that in stating this fact, they have thrown merited discredit on all his  pretended discoveries. But to make their case still stronger, they  delight to assert that he saw every thing through the medium of his  servant Francis Burnens, an ignorant peasant. Now this ignorant peasant  was a man of strong native intellect, possessing that indefatigable  energy and enthusiasm which are so indispensable to make a good  observer. He was a noble specimen of a self-made man, and afterwards  rose to be the chief magistrate in the village where he resided. Huber  has paid the most admirable tribute to his intelligence, fidelity and  indomitable patience, energy and skill.    It would be difficult to find, in any language, a better specimen of the  true Baconian or _inductive_ system of reasoning, than Huber's work upon  bees, and it might be studied as a model of the only true way of  investigating nature, so as to arrive at reliable results.    Huber was assisted in his investigations, not only by Burnens, but by  his own wife, to whom he was engaged before the loss of his sight, and  who nobly persisted in marrying him, notwithstanding his misfortune, and  the strenuous dissuasions of her friends. They lived for more than the  ordinary term of human life, in the enjoyment of uninterrupted domestic  happiness, and the amiable naturalist scarcely felt, in her assiduous  attentions, the loss of his sight.    Milton is believed by many, to have been a better poet, for his  blindness; and it is highly probable that Huber was a better Apiarian,  for the same cause. His active and yet reflective mind demanded constant  employment; and he found in the study of the habits of the honey bee,  full scope for all his powers. All the facts observed, and experiments  tried by his faithful assistants, were daily reported to him, and many  inquiries were stated and suggestions made by him, which would probably  have escaped his notice, if he had possessed the use of his eyes.    Few have such a command of both time and money as to enable them to  carry on, for a series of years, on a grand scale, the most costly  experiments. Apiarians owe more to Huber than to any other person. I  have repeatedly verified the most important of his observations, and I  take _the greatest delight_ in acknowledging my obligations to him, and  in holding him up to my countrymen, as the PRINCE OF APIARIANS.    My Readers will pardon this digression. It would have been morally  impossible for me to write a work on bees, without saying at least as  much as this, in vindication of Huber.    I return to his discoveries on the impregnation of the Queen Bee. By a  long course of experiments most carefully conducted, he ascertained that  like many other insects, she is fecundated in the open air, and on the  wing, and that the influence of this lasts for several years, and  probably for life. He could not form any satisfactory conjecture, as to  the way in which the eggs which were not yet developed in her ovaries,  could be fertilized. Years ago, the celebrated Dr. John Hunter, and  others, supposed that there must be a permanent receptacle for the male  sperm, opening into the passage for the eggs called the oviduct.  Dzierzon, who must be regarded as one of the ablest contributors of  modern times, to Apiarian science, maintains this opinion, and states  that he has found such a receptacle filled with a fluid, resembling the  semen of the drones. He nowhere, to my knowledge, states that he ever  made microscopic examinations, so as to put the matter on the footing of  demonstration.    In January and February of 1852, I submitted several Queen Bees to Dr.  Joseph Leidy of Philadelphia, for a scientific examination. I need  hardly say to any Naturalist in this country, that Dr. Leidy has  obtained the very highest reputation, both at home and abroad, as a  skillful naturalist and microscopic anatomist. No man in this country or  Europe, was more competent to make the investigations that I desired. He  found in making his dissections, a small globular sac, not larger than a  grain of mustard seed, (about 1/33 of an inch in diameter,)  communicating with the oviduct, and filled with a whitish fluid, which  when examined under the microscope, was found to abound in spermatozoa,  or the animalculae, which are the unmistakable characteristics of the  seminal fluid. Later in the season, the same substance was compared with  some taken from the drones, and found to be exactly similar to it.    These examinations have settled, on the impregnable basis of  demonstration, the mode in which the eggs of the Queen are vivified. In  descending the oviduct to be deposited in the cells, they pass by the  mouth of this seminal sac or spermatheca, and receive a portion of its  fertilizing contents. Small as it is, its contents are sufficient to  impregnate hundreds of thousands of eggs. In precisely the same way,  the mother wasps and hornets are fecundated. The females alone of these  insects survive the winter, and they begin, single-handed, the  construction of a nest, in which, at first, only a few eggs are  deposited. How could these eggs hatch, if the females which laid them,  had not been impregnated, the previous season? Dissection proves them to  have a spermatheca, similar to that of the Queen Bee.    Of all who have written against Huber, no one has treated him with more  unfairness, misrepresentation, and I might almost add, malignity, than  Huish. He maintains that the eggs of the Queen are impregnated by the  drones, after she has deposited them in the cells, and accounts for the  fact that brood is produced in the Spring, long before the existence of  any drones in the hive, by asserting that these eggs were deposited and  impregnated late in the previous season, and have remained dormant, all  winter, in the hive: and yet the same writer, while ridiculing the  discoveries of Huber, advises that all the mother wasps should be killed  in the Spring, to prevent them from founding families to commit  depredations upon the bees! It never seems to have occurred to him, that  the existence of a permanently impregnated mother wasp, was just as  difficult to be accounted for, as the existence of a similarly  impregnated Queen Bee.      EFFECT OF RETARDED IMPREGNATION ON THE QUEEN BEE.    I shall now mention a fact in the physiology of the Queen Bee, more  singular than any which has yet been related.    Huber, while experimenting to ascertain how the Queen was fecundated,  confined some of his young Queens to their hives, by contracting the  entrances, so that they were not able to go in search of the drones,  until three weeks after their birth. To his amazement, these Queens  whose impregnation was thus unnaturally retarded, _never laid any eggs  but such as produced drones_!!    He tried the experiment again and again, but always with the same  result. Some Bee-Keepers, long before his time, had observed that all  the brood in a hive were occasionally drones, and of course, that such  colonies rapidly went to ruin. Before attempting any explanation of this  astonishing fact, I must call the attention of the reader, to another of  the mysteries of the Bee-Hive,      FERTILE WORKERS.    It has already been remarked, that the workers are proved by dissection  to be females, all of which, under ordinary circumstances, are barren.  Occasionally, some of them appear to be more fully developed than  common, so as to be capable of laying eggs: these eggs, like those of  Queens whose impregnation has been retarded, _always produce drones_!  Sometimes, when a colony has lost its Queen, these drone-laying workers  are exalted to her place, and treated with equal respect and affection,  by the bees. Huber ascertained that these fertile workers were generally  reared in the neighborhood of the young Queens, and he thought that they  received some particles of the peculiar food or jelly on which the  Queens are reared. (See Royal Jelly.) He did not pretend to account for  the effect of retarded impregnation; and made no experiments to  determine the facts, as to the fecundation of these fertile workers.    Since the publication of Huber's work, nearly 50 years ago, no light has  been shed upon the mysteries of drone-laying Queens and workers, until  quite recently. Dzierzon appears to have been the first to ascertain the  truth on this subject; and his discovery must certainly be ranked as  unfolding one of the most astonishing facts in all the range of  animated nature. This fact seems, at first view, so absolutely  incredible, that I should not dare to mention it, if it were not  supported by the most indubitable evidence, and if I had not, (as I have  already observed,) determined to state all important and well  ascertained facts, without seeking, by any concealments, to pander to  the prejudices of conceited, and often, very ignorant Bee-Keepers.    Dzierzon advances the opinion that impregnation is not needed in order  that the eggs of the Queen may produce drones; but, that all impregnated  eggs produce females, either workers or Queens; and all unimpregnated  ones, males or drones! He states that he found drone-laying Queens in  several of his hives, whose wings were so imperfect that they could not  fly, and that on examination, they proved to be unfecundated. Hence he  concluded that the eggs of the Queen Bee or fertile worker, had from the  previous impregnation of the egg which produced them, sufficient  vitality"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],[0,"The Story of My Life (#6)"],[1,"y. My first promptings would have led me to say, \"Father, you have  expelled me from your house for being a Methodist; I am so still. I have  employed a man for you in my place for two years, during which time I  have been a student and a teacher, and unaccustomed to work on a farm, I  cannot now resume it.\" But I had left home for the honour of religion,  and I thought the honour of religion would be promoted by my returning  home, and showing still that the religion so much spoken against would  enable me to leave the school for the plough and the harvest-field, as  it had enabled me to leave home without knowing at the moment whether I  should be a teacher or a farm-labourer.    I relinquished my engagement as teacher within a few days, engaging  again on the farm with such determination and purpose that I ploughed  every acre of ground for the season, cradled every stalk of wheat, rye,  and oats, and mowed every spear of grass, pitched the whole, first on a  waggon, and then from the waggon on the hay-mow or stack. While the  neighbours were astonished at the possibility of one man doing so much  work, I neither felt fatigue nor depression, for \"the joy of the Lord  was my strength,\" both of body and mind, and I made nearly, if not  quite, as much progress in my studies as I had done while teaching  school. My Father then became changed in regard both to myself and the  religion I professed, desiring me to remain at home; but, having been  enabled to maintain a good conscience in the sight of God, and a good  report before men, in regard to my filial duty during my minority, I  felt that my life's work lay in another direction. I had refused,  indeed, the advice of senior Methodist ministers to enter into the  ministerial work, feeling myself as yet unqualified for it, and still  doubting whether I should ever engage in it, or in another profession.    I felt a strong desire to pursue further my classical studies, and  determined, with the kind counsel and aid of my eldest brother, to  proceed to Hamilton, and place myself for a year under the tuition of a  man of high reputation both as a scholar and a teacher, the late John  Law, Esq., then head master of the Gore District Grammar School. I  applied myself with such ardour, and prepared such an amount of work in  both Latin and Greek, that Mr. Law said it was impossible for him to  give the time and hear me read all that I had prepared, and that he  would, therefore, examine me on the translation and construction of the  more difficult passages, remarking more than once that it was impossible  for any human mind to sustain long the strain that I was imposing upon  mine. In the course of some six months his apprehensions were realized,  as I was seized with a brain fever, and on partially recovering took  cold, which resulted in inflammation of the lungs by which I was so  reduced that my physician, the late Dr. James Graham, of Norfolk,  pronounced my case hopeless, and my death was hourly expected.    In that extremity, while I felt even a desire to depart and be with  Christ, I was oppressed with the consciousness that I should have  yielded to the counsels of the chief ministers of my Church, as I could  have made nearly as much progress in my classical studies, and at the  same time been doing some good to the souls of men, instead of refusing  to speak in public as I had done. I then and there vowed that if I  should be restored to life and health, I would not follow my own  counsels, but would yield to the openings and calls which might be made  in the Church by its chief ministers. That very moment the cloud was  removed; the light of the glory of God shone into my mind and heart with  a splendour and power that I had never before experienced. My Mother,  entering the room a few moments after, exclaimed: \"Egerton, your  countenance is changed, you are getting better!\" My bodily recovery was  rapid; but the recovery of my mind from the shock which it had  experienced was slower, and for some weeks I could not even read, much  less study. While thus recovering, I exercised myself as I best could in  writing down my meditations.    My Father so earnestly solicited me to return, that he offered me a deed  of his farm if I would do so and live with him; but I declined acceding  to his request under any circumstances, expressing my conviction that  even could I do so, I thought it unwise and wrong for any parent to  place himself in a position of dependence upon any of his children for  support, so long as he could avoid doing so. One day, entering my room  and seeing a manuscript lying on the bed, he asked me what I had been  writing, and wished me to read it. I had written a meditation on part of  the last verse of the 73rd Psalm: \"it is good for me to draw near to  God.\" When I read to him what I had written my Father rose with a sigh,  remarking: \"Egerton, I don't think you will ever return home again,\" and  he never afterwards mooted the subject, except in a general way.    On recovering, I returned to Hamilton and resumed my studies; shortly  after which I went on a Saturday to a quarterly meeting, held about  twelve miles from Hamilton, at \"The Fifty,\" a neighborhood two or three  miles west of Grimsby, where I expected to meet my brother William, who  was one of the ministers on the circuit, which was then called the  Niagara Circuit--embracing the whole Niagara Peninsula, from five miles  east of Hamilton, and across to the west of Fort Erie. But my brother  did not attend, and I learned that he had been laid aside from his  ministerial work by bleeding of the lungs. Between love-feast and  preaching on Sunday morning, the presiding elder, the Rev. Thomas  Madden, the late Hugh Willson, and the late Smith Griffin (grandfather  of the Rev. W. S. Griffin), circuit stewards, called me aside and asked  if I had any engagements that would prevent me from coming on the  circuit to supply the place of my brother William, who might be unable  to resume his work for, perhaps, a year or more.    I felt that the vows of God were upon me, and I was for some moments  speechless from emotion. On recovering, I said I had no engagements  beyond my own plans and purposes; but I was yet weak in body from severe  illness, and I had no means for anything else than pursuing my studies,  for which aid had been provided.    One of the stewards replied that he would give me a horse, and the other  that he would provide me with a saddle and bridle. I then felt that I  had no choice but to fulfill the vow which I had made, on what was  supposed to my deathbed. I returned to Hamilton, settled with my  instructor and for my lodgings, and made my first attempt at preaching  at or near Beamsville, on Easter Sunday, 1825, in the morning, from the  5th verse of the 126th Psalm: \"They that sow in tears shall reap in  joy;\" and in the afternoon at \"The Fifty,\" on \"The Resurrection of  Christ.\"--Acts ii. 24.                                       Toronto, Nov. 11th, 1880.    Such was the sketch of my life which I wrote on Sabbath in my Long Point  Island Cottage, on the 24th of March, 1873, the 70th anniversary of my  birthday. I know not that I can add anything to the foregoing story of  my early life that would be worth writing or reading.           *       *       *       *       *    [In his cottage at Long Point, on his seventy-fifth birthday, Dr.  Ryerson wrote the following paper, which Dr. Potts read on the occasion  of his funeral discourse. It will be read with profoundest interest, as  one of the noblest of those Christian experiences which are the rich  heritage of the Church.--J. G. H.]                    Long Point Island Cottage, March 24th, 1878.    I am this day seventy-five years of age, and this day fifty-three years  ago, after resisting many solicitations to enter the ministry, and after  long and painful struggles, I decided to devote my life and all to the  ministry of the Methodist Church.    The predominant feeling of my heart is that of gratitude and  humiliation; gratitude for God's unbounded mercy, patience, and  compassion, in the bestowment of almost uninterrupted health, and  innumerable personal, domestic, and social blessings for more than fifty  years of a public life of great labour and many dangers; and humiliation  under a deep-felt consciousness of personal unfaithfulness, of many  defects, errors, and neglects in public duties. Many tell me that I have  been useful to the Church and the country; but my own consciousness  tells me that I have learned little, experienced little, done little in  comparison of what I might and ought to have known and done. By the  grace of God I am spared; by His grace I am what I am; all my trust for  salvation is in the efficacy of Jesus' atoning blood. I know whom I have  trusted, and \"am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have  committed unto Him against that day.\" I have no melancholy feelings or  fears. The joy of the Lord is my strength. I feel that I am now on the  bright side of seventy-five. As the evening twilight of my earthly life  advances, my spiritual sun shines with increased splendour. This has  been my experience for the last year. With an increased sense of my own  sinfulness, unworthiness, and helplessness, I have an increased sense of  the blessedness of pardon, the indwelling of the Comforter, and the  communion of saints.    Here, on bended knees, I give myself, and all I have and am, afresh to  Him whom I have endeavoured to serve, but very imperfectly, for more  than threescore years. All helpless, myself, I most humbly and devoutly  pray that Divine strength may be perfected in my weakness, and that my  last days on earth may be my best days--best days of implicit faith and  unreserved consecration, best days of simple scriptural ministrations  and public usefulness, best days of change from glory to glory, and of  becoming meet for the inheritance of the saints in light, "]]]
