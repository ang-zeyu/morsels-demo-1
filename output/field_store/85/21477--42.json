They saw indeed, they heard, but what availed    Or sight or hearing, all things round them rolling,    Like the unreal imagery of dreams    In wild confusion mixed!  The lightsome wall    Of finer masonry, the raftered roof    They knew not; but like ants still buried, delved    Deep in the earth and scooped their sunless caves.    Unmarked the seasons ranged, the biting winter,    The flower-perfumed spring, the ripening summer    Fertile of fruits.  At random all their works    Till I instructed them to mark the stars,    Their rising, and, a harder science yet,    Their setting.  The rich train of marshalled numbers    I taught them, and the meet array of letters.    To impress these precepts on their hearts I sent    Memory, the active mother of all reason.    I taught the patient steer to bear the yoke,    In all his toils joint-laborer of man.    By me the harnessed steed was trained to whirl    The rapid car, and grace the pride of wealth.    The tall bark, lightly bounding o'er the waves,    I taught its course, and winged its flying sail.    To man I gave these arts.\"    Potter's Translation from the Prometheus Bound    Jupiter, angry at the insolence and presumption of Prometheus in  taking upon himself to give all these blessings to man, condemned  the Titan to perpetual imprisonment, bound on a rock on Mount  Caucasus while a vulture should forever prey upon his liver.  This state of torment might at any time have been brought to an  end by Prometheus if he had been willing to submit to his  oppressor.  For Prometheus knew of a fatal marriage which Jove  must make and by which he must come to ruin.  Had Prometheus  revealed this secret he would at once have been taken into favor.  But this he disdained to do.  He has therefore become the symbol  of magnanimous endurance of unmerited suffering and strength of  will resisting oppression.    Byron and Shelley have both treated this theme.  The following  are Byron's lines:--      \"Titan!  To whose immortal eyes    The sufferings of mortality,    Seen in their sad reality,    Were not as things that gods despise,    What was thy pity's recompense?    A silent suffering, and intense;    The rock, the vulture, and the chain;    All that the proud can feel of pain;    The agony they do not show;    The suffocating sense of woe.      \"Thy godlike crime was to be kind;    To render with thy precepts less    The sum of human wretchedness,    And strengthen man with his own mind.    And, baffled as thou wert from high,    Still, in thy patient energy,    In the endurance and repulse,    Of thine impenetrable spirit,    Which earth and heaven could not convulse,    A mighty lesson we inherit.\"        PYTHON    The slime with which the earth was covered by the waters of the  flood, produced an excessive fertility, which called forth every  variety of production, both bad and good.  Among the rest,  Python, an enormous serpent, crept forth, the terror of the  people, and lurked in the caves of Mount Parnassus.  Apollo slew  him with his arrows   weapons which he had not before used  against any but feeble animals, hares, wild goats, and such game.  In commemoration of this illustrious conquest he instituted the  Pythian games, in which the victor in feats of strength,  swiftness of foot, or in the chariot race, was crowned with a  wreath of beech leaves; for the laurel was not yet adopted by  Apollo as his own tree.  And here Apollo founded his oracle at  Delphi, the only oracle \"that was not exclusively national, for  it was consulted by many outside nations, and, in fact, was held  in the highest repute all over the world.  In obedience to its  decrees, the laws of Lycurgus were introduced, and the earliest  Greek colonies founded.  No cities were built without first  consulting the Delphic oracle, for it was believed that Apollo  took special delight in the founding of cities, the first stone  of which he laid in person; nor was any enterprise ever  undertaken without inquiry at this sacred fane as to its probable  success\" [From Beren's Myths and Legends of Greece and Rome.]    The famous statue of Apollo called the Belvedere [From the  Belvedere of the Vatican palace where it stands] represents the  god after his victory over the serpent Python.  To this Byron  alludes in his Childe Harold, iv. 161:--      \"The lord of the unerring bow,    The god of life, and poetry, and light,    The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow    All radiant from his triumph in the fight.    The shaft has just been shot; the arrow bright    With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye    And nostril, beautiful disdain, and might,    And majesty flash their full lightnings by,    Developing in that one glance the Deity.\"      APOLLO AND DAPHNE    Daphne was Apollo's first love.  It was not brought about by  accident, but by the malice of Cupid.  Apollo saw the boy playing  with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated with his recent  victory over Python, he said to him, \"What have you to do with  warlike weapons, saucy boy?  Leave them for hands worthy of them.  Behold the conquest I have won by means of them over the vast  serpent who stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain!  Be content with your torch, child, and kindle up your flames, as  you call them, where you will, but presume not to meddle with my  weapons.\"    Venus's boy heard these words, and rejoined, \":Your arrows may  strike all things else, Apollo, but mine shall strike you.:\" So  saying, he took his stand on a rock of Parnassus, and drew from  his quiver two arrows of different workmanship, one to excite  love, the other to repel it.  The former was of gold and sharp-  pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead.  With the leaden  shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god  Peneus, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart.  Forthwith the god was seized with love for the maiden, and she  abhorred the thought of loving.  Her delight was in woodland  sports and in the spoils of the chase.  Many lovers sought her,  but she spurned them all, ranging the woods, and taking thought  neither of Cupid nor of Hymen.  Her father often said to her,  \"Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law; you owe me grandchildren.\"  She, hating the thought of marriage as a crime, with her  beautiful face tinged all over with blushes, threw her arms  around her father's neck, and said, \"Dearest father, grant me  this favor, that I may always remain unmarried, like Diana.\"  He  consented, but at the same time said, \"Your own face will forbid  it.\"    Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her; and he who gives  oracles to all in the world was not wise enough to look into his  own fortunes.  He saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders,  and said, \"If so charming in disorder, what would it be if  arranged?\"  He saw her eyes bright as stars; he saw her lips, and  was not satisfied with only seeing them.  He admired her hands  and arms bared to the shoulder, and whatever was hidden from view  he imagined more beautiful still.  He followed her; she fled,  swifter than the wind, and delayed not a moment at his  entreaties.  \"Stay,\" said he, \"daughter of Peneus; I am not a  foe.  Do not fly me as a lamb flies the wolf, or a dove the hawk.  It is for love I pursue you.  You make me miserable, for fear you  should fall and hurt yourself on these stones, and I should be  the cause.  Pray run slower, and I will follow slower.  I am no  clown, no rude peasant.  Jupiter is my father, and I am lord of  Delphos and Tenedos, and know all things, present and future.  I  am the god of song and the lyre.  My arrows fly true to the mark;  but alas!  An arrow more fatal than mine has pierced my heart!  I  am the god of medicine, and know the virtues of all healing  plants.  Alas!  I suffer a malady that no balm can cure!\"    The nymph continued her flight, and left his plea half uttered.  And even as she fled she charmed him.  The wind blew her  garments, and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her.  The  god grew impatient to find his wooings thrown away, and, sped by  Cupid, gained upon her in the race.  It was like a hound pursuing  a hare, with open jaws ready to seize, while the feebler animal  darts forward, slipping from the very grasp.  So flew the god and  the virgin   he on the wings of love, and she on those of fear.  The pursuer is the more rapid, however, and gains upon her, and  his panting breath blows upon her hair.  Now her strength begins  to fail, and, ready to sink, she calls upon her father, the river  god: \"Help me, Peneus!  Open the earth to enclose me, or change  my form, which has brought me into this danger!\"    Scarcely had she spoken, when a stiffness seized all her limbs;  her bosom began to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became  leaves; her arms became branches; her feet stuck fast in the  ground, as roots; her face became a tree-top, retaining nothing  of its former self but its beauty.  Apollo stood amazed.  He  touched the stem, and felt the flesh tremble under the new bark.  He embraced the branches, and lavished kisses on the wood.  The  branches shrank from his lips.  \"Since you cannot be my wife,\"  said he, \"you shall assuredly be my tree.  I will wear you for my  crown.  With you I will decorate my harp and my quiver; and when  the great Roman conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to the  Capitol, you shall be woven into wreaths for their brows.  And,  as eternal youth is mine, you also shall be always green, and  your leaf know no decay.\"  The nymph, now changed into a laurel  tree, bowed its head in grateful acknowledgment.    Apollo was god of music and of poetry and also of medicine.  For,  as the poet Armstrong says, himself a physician:--      \"Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,    Expels disease, softens every pain;    And hence the wise of ancient days adored    One"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#6)"],[1,"an amazed glance  upon her. Mrs. Raymond interposed quickly:    \"Beatrice is right, William. It has been long since she has seen you,  and you will naturally wish to spend as much time with her as possible.  I have already arranged for Adele to go to mother's for the summer. She  may come to you in the fall; if Beatrice wishes.\"    \"Perhaps that will be better,\" acquiesced the traveller quietly. \"And  now, as we are all here together, it may be the time and place for  explanations. I don't know whether one is due me, or to Beatrice; but I  do not understand how I received this in place of her picture. Can you  explain the mistake, my daughter?\"    He drew Adele's photograph from the inside pocket of his coat as he  spoke, and handed it to Bee. She gave an exclamation of astonishment as  she saw the beautiful, laughing countenance on the cardboard instead of  her own. Then she raised her eyes, and gave Adele a long, steady look.  Adele had changed the photographs, and Bee knew that it had been done on  purpose. She saw that her cousin was a little frightened, and she  wondered what explanation she would make.    Adele was frightened. It had not occurred to her that the matter would  take on a serious aspect, and she feared to say that she had made the  exchange in fun. So she reached over and took the photograph from Bee  with a hand that trembled slightly.    \"Why! It's my picture,\" she cried with a little hysterical giggle. \"What  a mistake! I remember now they both came home together, and lay on the  desk in the library. They must have gotten mixed some way. It would have  been easy to change them.\"    \"Why, so it would,\" agreed her mother with a relieved expression. \"I  remember they were on the desk together. Bee must have picked up yours,  Adele, by mistake.\"    And Adele said not a word about its being her fault. She had no fear of  Bee's telling either. Her cousin had a boy's sense of honor about such  things, and unless she herself owned up, the matter would rest between  them. So she made no further comment on the subject, and the older  people, deeming the affair of no great importance since it was known  that a mistake had been made, resumed conversation.    Bee sat silent, her heart swelling almost to bursting. The words of her  father's letter rang in her brain: \"It is partly your letters that have  wrought this change ... and partly your picture, which completed what  the letters had begun. I cannot resist its winsomeness.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was Adele's picture which had brought him home. He would not have  come had she sent her own. He had thought the beautiful girl was his  daughter, and he was disappointed because she was not. He wanted Adele.  Adele!    The dinner, on the whole not a successful meal, was over at last. The  older people were deep in conversation; the traveller narrating his  experiences, the others questioning and exclaiming. Bee had pictured  just such a scene, but always in fancy she sat close to her father's  side with her hand in his, or else his arm was thrown caressingly around  her. The reality was so different that it was more than she could bear.  Seeing that she was unobserved, she rose and stole quietly out of the  house.    The light breeze, breathing of the sweetness of honeysuckles and roses,  touched the tops of the walnut trees and dipped down to stir the cool  grass beneath them. Into the darkness of the grove went the unhappy  girl. When she had reached a place where she was out of sight and sound  of the house she threw herself down, and gave way to a passion of tears.    \"It's not fair,\" she sobbed in angry resentment. \"She has her father,  and her mother too; and now she has to take mine. Oh, I can't bear it! I  can't bear it!\"    \"Bee!\" Adele had seen her cousin leave the house, and had followed her.    \"Go away,\" cried Bee, sitting up and speaking vehemently. \"Go away,  Adele Raymond! I hate you!\"    \"I don't see why you should,\" whimpered Adele. \"I shouldn't think you  would care so much for such a little thing. I shouldn't mind it a bit,  if I were in your place.\"    \"Yes, you would,\" blazed Bee. \"If you had not seen your father since you  were a little girl, and when he came home he thought some one else was  you, you wouldn't like it a bit more than I do. Adele Raymond, you  changed those pictures on purpose.\"    \"It was only in fun, Bee. Truly, I did not mean it any other way. I  never dreamed that your father would come back just because of it.\"    \"But you did know that if he thought the picture was mine he would think  I was pretty. How could he help it? It would give him a wrong idea of  how I looked, and when he came he would be disappointed. You knew that.  And then you ran out just as soon as you heard the carriage.\"    \"I didn't do that on purpose anyway, Bee. I was singing, you know, when  I heard the wheels, and I ran out without thinking.\"    \"But I heard Aunt Annie tell you to wait in the parlor until I had  greeted father,\" went on Bee accusingly. \"You ran right out to the door  where the light would fall on you, so that he could not help but see you  first. It was done on purpose. I know it was. I'll never trust you again  in anything.\"    \"I didn't think,\" said Adele again. \"I didn't know that he was going to  take me for his daughter, even though I did send him my picture. Anyway  you ought to be glad that I sent it. He would not have come if I  hadn't.\"    \"That's just it,\" uttered Bee with a pitiful sob. \"If it were just a  mistake of the moment I could get over it, even though that would be bad  enough. But it's knowing that he poured over your picture, thinking that  it was his daughter. It's knowing that he was glad that you were  beautiful when I am not. It's knowing that it was for you that he came  home, and not for me at all. Oh! he never will care for an ugly old  thing like me now.\"    \"Yes, he will. Everybody likes you best when they know us both for a  time. Then your mind--\"    \"Bother the mind!\" ejaculated the other girl fiercely. \"Mind doesn't  count. It's only being pretty that counts, and you know it, Adele  Raymond. Doesn't everyone indulge you just because you are pretty? And  now my father--and he's the only father I've got, too--now he's just  like everybody else. Oh, I hate you!\"    \"I don't want you to hate me, Bee,\" cried Adele, her own tears beginning  to flow. \"You never cared before that I was pretty.\"    \"I wouldn't care now if father didn't--didn't--\" Bee broke down  completely, unable to finish.    \"Won't you be friends, Bee?\" pleaded Adele.    \"No; I won't,\" answered Bee with decision.    \"And won't you let me stay with you this Summer? I don't like grandma's.  It's poky there.\" Adele never once mentioned Bee's telling who had  changed the pictures. She knew without asking that Bee would not.    \"I don't want you here,\" replied Bee angrily. \"You want to stay because  father admires you, but you shan't do it. I want him to myself, and I've  a right to have him. He's my father!\"    \"Please, Bee,\" coaxed Adele. Bee always gave in to her pleadings, and  she could not believe that she would not do so now.    \"I am going to my room,\" announced Beatrice, rising. \"And I don't want  to be followed there.\"    She walked abruptly away, leaving Adele weeping softly.          Chapter V    Protective Mimicry        \"Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt,      Nothing's so hard but search will find it out.\"        --_Herrick._      The next day Mr. and Mrs. Henry Raymond with Adele went home. For the  first time in their lives the girls took leave of each other with  coldness. The older people affected not to notice the lack of warmth in  their adieus, believing that time and absence would heal the breach  between them. Before their departure Mrs. Raymond had called her niece  to her for a little talk.    \"Bee, dear,\" she said, \"you don't know how sorry I am for what has  occurred. It was a most unfortunate mistake, but you must put all  thought of it out of your mind. Be your own bright self again.\"    \"I want to be pretty, Aunt Annie,\" burst from Bee, whose eyes were  swollen and red from much weeping.    \"That is nonsense, Beatrice,\" spoke her aunt sharply. \"You cannot change  your looks. 'What can't be cured must be endured.' Your personal  appearance heretofore has caused you no concern, and there is no reason  that it should begin to trouble you now. Beauty is not everything.  Sometimes the plainest countenance becomes charming when stirred by the  emotions of a noble heart.\"    \"Yes; I know,\" said Beatrice dully. \"I know all that. I've heard it ever  since I can remember. My father would say the same thing, I dare say,  yet his eyes follow Adele constantly, and he scarcely looks at me.  People are always preaching how little beauty matters, and then they  turn round and show that it makes all the difference in the world. Take  Adele and me, Aunt Annie. Haven't I always had to stand back for her?  You know that I have. I have given up my prettiest things to her, and  been second in everything. But she shall not be first with my father.  She shall not,\" she repeated passionately.    \"You do not realize what you are saying, Beatrice,\" said Mrs. Raymond  coldly, surprised and shocked by the girl's bitterness. It was such an  ordinary occurrence for Adele to be admired that she did not fully  grasp what it meant to her niece in the present instance. Then, too,  Beatrice had always seemed to join in the admiration of her cousin so  warmly that the lady was astonished at her feeling.    \"I do not see why you should exhibit so much emotion over a simple  occurrence,\" she continued after a moment. \"It was a thing that might  happen to anyone, and you are exaggerating the importance of it. Think  no more about it, but make yourself so lovable that no one will care  whether you are pretty or not. It lies in your power to win your  father's affection, but it can not be done by"]]]
