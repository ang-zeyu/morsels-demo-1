There was a suggestion  of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another; an  arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemed  dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic  vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap-shots, if one might use  the term, of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity.    Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd  of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats  frowning down on him. Again he seemed to be in the interior of a  house--an old house, apparently--but the details and inhabitants were  constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the  furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in  just as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects. It  was queer--damnably queer--and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if  half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange  faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. And  all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some  pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to  possess itself of his vital processes.    I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were  by eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown  forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;  but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that  these uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle's  reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled  our minds to the exclusion of all else.    Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and  in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle  seemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though  the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours.    Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the  most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal  loneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where I  lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing  yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle's face  came to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours, and I  recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a  pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek  which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and  startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out  with more than natural clearness and reality.      5    I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in  this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the  window, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room,  all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter  than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside. It was  not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong  enough to read an average book by. But it cast a shadow of myself and  the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted  at things more potent than luminosity. This I perceived with unhealthy  sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently  assailed. For on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking  scream, while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place.  My mind, as alert as my senses, recognized the gravely unusual; and  almost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the  destructive instruments which we had left trained on the moldy spot  before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for the  scream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against what menace  I should have to defend him and myself.    Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors  beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable  hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few.  Out of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,  yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in  vague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could see  the chimney and fireplace beyond. It was all eyes--wolfish and  mocking--and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the top to a thin  stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the  chimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in conscious  retrospection that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach to  form. At the time, it was to me only a seething, dimly phosphorescent  cloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and dissolving to an  abhorrent plasticity the one object on which all my attention was  focussed. That object was my uncle--the venerable Elihu Whipple--who  with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me, and  reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had  brought.    It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled  myself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved  me. Recognizing the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter or  material chemistry, and therefore ignoring the flame-thrower which  loomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube apparatus,  and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongest  ether radiations which man's art can arouse from the spaces and fluids  of nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering, and the  yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes. But I saw the dimness  was only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had no  effect whatever.    Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror  which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering  toward that unlocked door to the quiet street, careless of what abnormal  terrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men I  brought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form  of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes  all description, and in which there played across his vanishing face  such changes of identity as only madness can conceive. He was at once a  devil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant. Lit by the mixed  and uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a dozen--a score--a  hundred--aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground on a body that  melted like tallow, in the caricatured likeness of legions strange and  yet not strange.    I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and  infantile, and other features old and young, coarse and refined,  familiar and unfamiliar. For a second there flashed a degraded  counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in  the School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the  raw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in  Carrington Harris's house. It was frightful beyond conception; toward  the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered  close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was  spreading, it seemed as though the shifting features fought against  themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindly  face. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he tried  to bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my own  parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of grease  following me through the door to the rain-drenched sidewalk.           *       *       *       *       *    The rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soaking  street, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked  aimlessly south past College Hill and the Athenaeum, down Hopkins Street,  and over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings seemed  to guard me as modern material things guard the world from ancient and  unwholesome wonder. Then gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east,  silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples, and beckoning  me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished. And in the  end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, and entered  that awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which still  swung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom I  dared not speak.    The grease was gone, for the moldy floor was porous. And in front of the  fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form traced in niter.  I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and  the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could  scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality. Then thought  trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than  I had dreamed.    Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me  just what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it had  been real. Matter it seemed not to be, nor ether, nor anything else  conceivable by mortal mind. What, then, but some exotic _emanation_;  some vampirish vapor such as Exeter rustics tell of as lurking over  certain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the  floor before the fireplace where the mold and niter had taken strange  forms.    In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for  home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,  a spade, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#6)"],[1,"onjurers' attacks upon  the queen. No doubt the activity of the council put all conjurers under  public suspicion and in some degree roused public resentment against  them.    This brings us back to the point: What had the conjurers to do with  witchcraft? By this time the answer is fairly obvious. The practisers of  the magic arts, the charmers and enchanters, were responsible for  developing the notions of witchcraft. The good witch brought in her  company the black witch. This in itself might never have meant more than  an increased activity in the church courts. But when Protestant England  grew suddenly nervous for the life of the queen, when the conjurers  became a source of danger to the sovereign, and the council commenced  its campaign against them, the conditions had been created in which  witchcraft became at once the most dangerous and detested of crimes.  While the government was busy putting down the conjurers, the aroused  popular sentiment was compelling the justices of the peace and then the  assize judges to hang the witches.    This cannot be better illustrated than by the Abingdon affair of  1578-1579. Word had been carried to the privy council that Sir Henry  Newell, justice of the peace, had committed some women near Abingdon on  the charge of making waxen images.[44] The government was at once  alarmed and sent a message to Sir Henry and to the Dean of Windsor  instructing them to find out the facts and to discover if the plots were  directed against the queen. The precaution was unnecessary. There was no  ground for believing that the designs of the women accused had included  the queen. Indeed the evidence of guilt of any kind was very flimsy. But  the excitement of the public had been stirred to the highest pitch. The  privy council had shown its fear of the women and all four of them went  to the gallows.[45]    The same situation that brought about the attack upon witchcraft and  conjuration was no doubt responsible for the transfer of jurisdiction  over the crime. We have already seen that the practice of conjuration  had probably been left largely to the episcopal hierarchy for  punishment.[46] The archdeacons were expected in their visitations to  inquire into the practice of enchantment and magic within the parishes  and to make report.[47] In the reign of Elizabeth it became no light  duty. The church set itself to suppress both the consulter and the  consulted.[48] By the largest number of recorded cases deal of course  with the first class. It was very easy when sick or in trouble to go to  a professed conjurer for help.[49] It was like seeking a physician's  service, as we have seen. The church frowned upon it, but the danger  involved in disobeying the church was not deemed great. The cunning man  or woman was of course the one who ran the great risk. When worst came  to worst and the ecclesiastical power took cognizance of his profession,  the best he could do was to plead that he was a \"good witch\" and  rendered valuable services to the community.[50] But a good end was in  the eyes of the church no excuse for an evil means. The good witches  were dealers with evil spirits and hence to be repressed.    Yet the church was very light in its punishments. In the matter of  penalties, indeed, consulter and consulted fared nearly alike, and both  got off easily. Public confession and penance in one or more  specifically designated churches, usually in the nearest parish church,  constituted the customary penalty.[51] In a few instances it was  coupled with the requirement that the criminal should stand in the  pillory, taper in hand, at several places at stated times.[52] The  ecclesiastical records are so full of church penances that a student is  led to wonder how effectual they were in shaming the penitent into  better conduct. It may well be guessed that most of the criminals were  not sensitive souls that would suffer profoundly from the disgrace  incurred.    The control of matters of this kind was in the hands of the church by  sufferance only. So long as the state was not greatly interested, the  church was permitted to retain its jurisdiction.[53] Doubtless the kings  of England would have claimed the state's right of jurisdiction if it  had become a matter of dispute. The church itself recognized the secular  power in more important cases.[54] In such cases the archdeacon usually  acted with the justice of peace in conducting the examination,[55] as in  rendering sentence. Even then, however, the penalty was as a rule  ecclesiastical. But, with the second half of the sixteenth century,  there arose new conditions which resulted in the transfer of this  control to the state. Henry VIII had broken with Rome and established a  Church of England around the king as a centre. The power of the church  belonged to the king, and, if to the king, to his ministers and his  judges. Hence certain crimes that had been under the control of the  church fell under the jurisdiction of the king's courts.[56] In a more  special way the same change came about through the attack of the privy  council upon the conjurers. What had hitherto been a comparatively  insignificant offence now became a crime against the state and was so  dealt with.    The change, of course, was not sudden. It was not accomplished in a  year, nor in a decade. It was going on throughout the first half of  Elizabeth's reign. By the beginning of the eighties the church control  was disappearing. After 1585 the state had practically exclusive  jurisdiction.[57]    We have now finished the attempt to trace the beginning of the definite  movement against witchcraft in England. What witchcraft was, what it  became, how it was to be distinguished from sorcery--these are questions  that we have tried to answer very briefly. We have dealt in a cursory  way with a series of cases extending from Anglo-Saxon days down to the  fifteenth century in order to show how unfixed was the matter of  jurisdiction. We have sought also to explain how Continental opinion was  introduced into England through Jewel and other Marian exiles, to show  what independent forces were operating in England, and to exhibit the  growing influence of the charmers and their relation to the development  of witchcraft; and lastly we have aimed to prove that the special danger  to the queen had no little part in creating the crusade against witches.  These are conclusions of some moment and a caution must be inserted. We  have been treating of a period where facts are few and information  fragmentary. Under such circumstances conclusions can only be tentative.  Perhaps the most that can be said of them is that they are suggestions.
