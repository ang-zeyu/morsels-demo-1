There is much  talk of their objectional features and dangers for the established  order of things. You might think the firmament was going to crumble  to pieces or the world was threatening to go out of joint. However,  after the innovation has been made, it is found to be quite natural and  logical, because things go on in their natural course, the heavenly  bodies continue in their orbits as before and the mountain peaks do  not slide down into the valleys. Courage and hope are born again in  the human breast, the masses get used to the new state of affairs,  and soon even the most recalcitrant would be furious if any one should  propose to return to the old order of things. This has happened in  our country before, and has always been and always will be the way  in which progress is worked out.    We must make up our minds to overcome our scruples and fears. If  in discussing the aeroplane, we were to speak of nothing but of the  number of aviators who have been killed, we would never accept that  invention. We must embark in one in order to prove to ourselves that  our fears and apprehensions are unfounded. Sight must not be lost of  the fact that suffragism is not a new thing in the world, that it is  far from being an experiment and is already an established fact in some  countries. Exactly the same as the aeroplane: if we desire to become  acquainted with the advantages of that apparatus, we do not ask those  who have never traveled in it, but those who have experimented with it,  and if we wish to know the advantages of suffragism, we must not listen  to those who oppose it as a matter of principle and theory, but must  consult countries that have made experiments with it and have already  had a chance to see its results. We must take note of the fact that  suffragism is gaining in strength every day and is becoming a general  movement in the countries where it has found acceptance. Exactly like  the aeroplane. Would it not be perfectly ridiculous to declaim against  the aeroplane on account of the accidents that are liable to occur,  and would we not be stupid to refuse to follow the lead of other  governments who utilize its advantages for defence or aggression in  war and for rapid communication in time of peace? And is it not just  as stupid and even senseless to oppose suffragism on speculative or  rather hypothetical grounds, instead of being guided by the experience  of other countries in this respect and accepting suffragism as part  and parcel of our modern customs and institutions?    In conclusion, permit me to quote a few passages on this subject from  an address which I made at an entertainment given at the Opera House  in honor of Rizal by various schools for young ladies in 1913:          According to the old idea, woman's sphere of action should      not extend beyond the home, beyond her domestic occupations,      and she should be nothing but the glory and delight of      her husband and her children. This is not right. Like man,      woman is born and lives in society, and she can not and must      not remain indifferent to social distress and suffering. To      think otherwise would be selfishness and aberration and would      leave society a prey to much suffering which only the blessed      hand of woman can cure or relieve. Let woman be the glory and      happiness of the home; but do not forget that she must extend      her beneficent action beyond the confines of the household,      that she must make the world outside the participant of the      wealth of kindness and charity that bountiful Providence has      lavished upon her. Just as she shares the duties of life with      man within the home, so should she without it, in public life,      share with man the responsibility of remedying and alleviating      public distress and misfortune.        It is very significant that beneficence, charity, and morality      are feminine virtues, it being woman's mission to exercise all      these virtues in society. She must take a part, and should,      in my opinion, always take the initiative, in all work for      the protection of the orphans, the relief of distress, and      the elevation of the standard of public morality. She must      strive and suffer, in the society in which she is living,      for all that is feminine in life, must with a wave of her      hand attenuate the fierceness of the struggle for existence,      and must brighten the gloomy night of human suffering with      her gentle presence. Our country needs not only the strength      of her men, but the kindness and charity of her women;      she needs not only heroes, but also heroines. And heroines      exist and always have existed in the history of humankind;      and there are and always have been heroines in our country,      the special privilege of which, according to serious foreign      authors, consists in its women being superior to its men.        And the girls who to-day pay homage to Rizal and dedicate their      songs and prayers to him, will to-morrow be citizenesses who      will not, like unhappy Maria Clara, be made the victims of      social injustice, but will help to banish social injustice      and strive for justice, virtue, and the glory and greatness      of their native land.      Yes; I cherish that hope and have faith in the liberty of woman. It  is not possible to keep one-half of humanity in the upper part and  the other half in the lower part of the balance without producing  disequilibrium, tears, and suffering. Everything tends to reach the  same level in life, the same as in death, the great leveller. Humanity  has seen a new light which will shine brightly, though error and  prejudice may endeavor to shroud it with darkness. Woe to those who  refuse to see the light! The world continues to progress and stops  for no one. He who wishes to lag behind is free to do so, but he will  surely deplore it afterwards.    I can not prophesy what will be the outcome of the efforts which the  Filipino women are now making to obtain suffrage; but I know that  these efforts must be to them, and are to us, a source of pride and  glory, because they show that there is no part of our people which  has remained indifferent to the great movements of the century. There  are persons who scoff at them and many shrug their shoulders; but  this must not discourage our women, because neither scoffing nor  shrugging the shoulders are very weighty arguments. The same persons  who now laugh at them and shrug their shoulders, probably because they  do not know that the world and society are moving and progressing,  will some day recognize that these women were in the right, just as  the men who scoffed at Rizal lived to deplore their mistake and have  since made amends.    What we must do is to diffuse the light and spread the new doctrines,  in order to convince those who unwittingly refuse to see justice and  truth, the only firm foundations of the stability and prosperity of  civilized society.

La causa del sufragio femenino es una causa que  despierta la simpatia de todo hombre desapasionado, porque representa  la causa del debil que, privado del medio de defenderse por si mismo,  pone toda su razon y derecho al arbitrio del fuerte.    Pero no es solamente por esto que atrae mi simpatia y apela a mi  defensa. Es ademas que dicha causa tiene en si un fondo irresistible de  verdad y justicia al cual no puede negarse ninguna inteligencia abierta  y libre. Si nuestra conciencia como legisladores debe inspirarse en  las eternas fuentes del derecho, si las leyes que aqui formulamos  deben llevar el sello divino de dar a cada uno lo suyo, no podemos  rehusar a la mujer el derecho del voto como no pretendamos renegar  de todas las formulas y conquistas de la democracia y de la libertad  que han hecho de este siglo el ser llamado con propiedad el siglo de  las reivindicaciones.    El sufragio femenino es una reforma exigida por las condiciones  sociales de nuestro tiempo, por la elevacion de la cultura de  la mujer y las aspiraciones de todas las clases o grupos de la  sociedad a organizarse para trabajar por los intereses que tienen  de comun. No podemos parar el movimiento de los astros y no podemos  parar igualmente ninguno de esos movimientos morales que gravitan con  incontrastable fuerza hacia su centro de atraccion: la Justicia. Pues  el mundo moral esta regido por las mismas leyes que el fisico y si  el poder del hombre es impotente para suprimir una molecula de los  espacios necesaria a la gravitacion universal, menos podra contener  la generacion de las ideas elaboradas en la conciencia y ansiosas de  encarnar en los fecundos senos de la vida y de la realidad.

Malicorne and Manicamp.    The introduction of these two new personages into this history and that  mysterious affinity of names and sentiments, merit some attention on the  part of both historian and reader. We will then enter into some details  concerning Messieurs Malicorne and Manicamp. Malicorne, we know, had  made the journey to Orleans in search of the _brevet_ destined for  Mademoiselle de Montalais, the arrival of which had produced such a  strong feeling at the castle of Blois. At that moment, M. de Manicamp  was at Orleans. A singular person was this M. de Manicamp; a very  intelligent young fellow, always poor, always needy, although he dipped  his hand freely into the purse of M. le Comte de Guiche, one of the best  furnished purses of the period. M. le Comte de Guiche had had, as  the companion of his boyhood, this De Manicamp, a poor gentleman,  vassal-born, of the house of Gramont. M. de Manicamp, with his tact  and talent had created himself a revenue in the opulent family of the  celebrated marechal. From his infancy he had, with calculation beyond  his age, lent his mane and complaisance to the follies of the Comte de  Guiche. If his noble companion had stolen some fruit destined for  Madame la Marechale, if he had broken a mirror, or put out a dog's eye,  Manicamp declared himself guilty of the crime committed, and received  the punishment, which was not made the milder for falling on the  innocent. But this was the way this system of abnegation was paid  for: instead of wearing such mean habiliments as his paternal fortunes  entitled him to, he was able to appear brilliant, superb, like a young  noble of fifty thousand livres a year. It was not that he was mean in  character or humble in spirit; no, he was a philosopher, or rather he  had the indifference, the apathy, the obstinacy which banish from man  every sentiment of the supernatural. His sole ambition was to spend  money. But, in this respect, the worthy M. de Manicamp was a gulf. Three  or four times every year he drained the Comte de Guiche, and when the  Comte de Guiche was thoroughly drained, when he had turned out his  pockets and his purse before him, when he declared that it would be at  least a fortnight before paternal munificence would refill those pockets  and that purse, Manicamp lost all his energy, he went to bed, remained  there, ate nothing and sold his handsome clothes, under the pretense  that, remaining in bed, he did not want them. During this prostration  of mind and strength, the purse of the Comte de Guiche was getting full  again, and when once filled, overflowed into that of De Manicamp, who  bought new clothes, dressed himself again, and recommenced the same  life he had followed before. The mania of selling his new clothes for  a quarter of what they were worth, had rendered our hero sufficiently  celebrated in Orleans, a city where, in general, we should be puzzled  to say why he came to pass his days of penitence. Provincial _debauches,  petits-maitres_ of six hundred livres a year, shared the fragments of  his opulence.    Among the admirers of these splendid toilettes, our friend Malicorne  was conspicuous; he was the son of a syndic of the city, of whom M.  de Conde, always needy as a De Conde, often borrowed money at enormous  interest. M. Malicorne kept the paternal money-chest; that is to  say, that in those times of easy morals, he had made for himself, by  following the example of his father, and lending at high interest for  short terms, a revenue of eighteen hundred livres, without reckoning  six hundred livres furnished by the generosity of the syndic; so that  Malicorne was the king of the gay youth of Orleans, having two thousand  four hundred livres to scatter, squander, and waste on follies of every  kind. But, quite contrary to Manicamp, Malicorne was terribly ambitious.  He loved from ambition; he spent money out of ambition; and he would  have ruined himself for ambition. Malicorne had determined to rise, at  whatever price it might cost, and for this, whatever price it did cost,  he had given himself a mistress and a friend. The mistress, Mademoiselle  de Montalais, was cruel, as regarded love; but she was of a noble  family, and that was sufficient for Malicorne. The friend had little or  no friendship, but he was the favorite of the Comte de Guiche, himself  the friend of Monsieur, the king's brother; and that was sufficient for  Malicorne. Only, in the chapter of charges, Mademoiselle de Montalais  cost _per annum_:--ribbons, gloves, and sweets, a thousand livres.  De Manicamp cost--money lent, never returned--from twelve to fifteen  hundred livres _per annum_. So that there was nothing left for  Malicorne. Ah! yes, we are mistaken; there was left the paternal strong  box. He employed a mode of proceeding, upon which he preserved the most  profound secrecy, and which consisted in advancing to himself, from  the coffers of the syndic, half a dozen year's profits, that is to  say, fifteen thousand livres, swearing to himself--observe, quite to  himself--to repay this deficiency as soon as an opportunity should  present itself. The opportunity was expected to be the concession of  a good post in the household of Monsieur, when that household would be  established at the period of his marriage. This juncture had arrived,  and the household was about to be established. A good post in the family  of a prince of the blood, when it is given by the credit, and on the  recommendation of a friend, like the Comte de Guiche, is worth at least  twelve thousand livres _per annum_; and by the means which M. Malicorne  had taken to make his revenues fructify, twelve thousand livres might  rise to twenty thousand. Then, when once an incumbent of this post, he  would marry Mademoiselle de Montalais. Mademoiselle de Montalais, of  a half noble family, not only would be dowered, but would ennoble  Malicorne. But, in order that Mademoiselle de Montalais, who had not a  large patrimonial fortune, although an only daughter, should be suitably  dowered, it was necessary that she should belong to some great princess,  as prodigal as the dowager Madame was covetous. And in order that the  wife should not be of one party whilst the husband belonged to the  other, a situation which presents serious inconveniences, particularly  with characters like those of the future consorts--Malicorne had  imagined the idea of making the central point of union the household of  Monsieur, the king's brother. Mademoiselle de Montalais would be maid of  honor to Madame. M. Malicorne would be officer to Monsieur.    It is plain the plan was formed by a clear head; it is plain, also,  that it had been bravely executed. Malicorne had asked Manicamp to ask  a _brevet_ of maid of honor of the Comte de Guiche; and the Comte de  Guiche had asked this _brevet_ of Monsieur, who had signed it without  hesitation. The constructive plan of Malicorne--for we may well suppose  that the combinations of a mind as active as his were not confined  to the present, but extended to the future--the constructive plan of  Malicorne, we say, was this:--To obtain entrance into the household of  Madame Henrietta for a woman devoted to himself, who was intelligent,  young, handsome, and intriguing; to learn, by means of this woman, all  the feminine secrets of the young household; whilst he, Malicorne, and  his friend Manicamp, should, between them, know all the male secrets  of the young community. It was by these means that a rapid and splendid  fortune might be acquired at one and the same time. Malicorne was a  vile name; he who bore it had too much wit to conceal this truth from  himself; but an estate might be purchased; and Malicorne of some place,  or even De Malicorne itself, for short, would ring more nobly on the  ear.    It was not improbable that a most aristocratic origin might be hunted up  by the heralds for this name of Malicorne; might it not come from some  estate where a bull with mortal horns had caused some great misfortune,  and baptized the soil with the blood it had spilt? Certes, this plan  presented itself bristling with difficulties: but the greatest of all  was Mademoiselle de Montalais herself. Capricious, variable, close,  giddy,"]]]
