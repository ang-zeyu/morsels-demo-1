Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly  all of its export receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly  25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming  economy and helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization.  Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's  highly centralized economy, have brought the nation to its most serious  social and economic crisis since independence. The government has  promised far-reaching reforms, including giving public-sector companies  more autonomy, encouraging private-sector activity, boosting gas and  nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major overhaul of the banking  and financial systems, but to date has made little progress.      _#_GDP: $54 billion, per capita $2,130; real growth rate 2.5%  (1990 est.)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 16.6% (1990)      _#_Unemployment rate: 26% (1990 est.)      _#_Budget: revenues $16.7 billion; expenditures $17.3 billion,  including capital expenditures of $6.6 billion (1990 est.)      _#_Exports: $10.2 billion (f.o.b., 1990 est.);    commodities--petroleum and natural gas 98%;    partners--Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Italy, France, US      _#_Imports: $9.2 billion (f.o.b., 1990 est.);    commodities--capital goods 29%, consumer goods 30%;    partners--France 25%, Italy 8%, FRG 8%, US 6-7%      _#_External debt: $26.6 billion (December 1990)      _#_Industrial production: growth rate -3% (1989 est.); accounts for  30% of GDP, including petroleum      _#_Electricity: 5,156,000 kW capacity; 14,900 million kWh  produced, 580 kWh per capita (1990)      _#_Industries: petroleum, light industries, natural gas, mining,  electrical, petrochemical, food processing      _#_Agriculture: accounts for 11% of GDP and employs 24% of labor  force; net importer of food--grain, vegetable oil, and sugar; farm  production includes wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits,  sheep,and cattle      _#_Economic aid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-85), $1.4  billion; Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments  (1970-88), $8.5 billion; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $1.8 billion;  Communist countries (1970-89), $2.7 billion      _#_Currency: Algerian dinar (plural--dinars); 1 Algerian dinar  (DA) = 100 centimes      _#_Exchange rates: Algerian dinars (DA) per US$1--13.581 (January  1991), 8.958 (1990), 7.6086 (1989), 5.9148 (1988), 4.8497 (1987), 4.7023  (1986), 5.0278 (1985)      _#_Fiscal year: calendar year      _*_Communications  _#_Railroads: 4,146 km total; 2,632 km standard gauge (1.435 m),  1,258 km 1.055-meter gauge, 256 km 1.000-meter gauge; 300 km electrified;  215 km double track      _#_Highways: 80,000 km total; 60,000 km concrete or bituminous,  20,000 km gravel, crushed stone, unimproved earth      _#_Pipelines: crude oil, 6,612 km; refined products, 298 km; natural  gas, 2,948 km      _#_Ports: Algiers, Annaba, Arzew, Bejaia, Jijel, Mers el Kebir,  Mostaganem, Oran, Skikda      _#_Merchant marine: 75 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 903,179  GRT/1,063,994 DWT; includes 5 short-sea passenger, 27 cargo, 2 vehicle  carrier, 10 roll-on/roll-off cargo, 5 petroleum, oils, and lubricants  (POL) tanker, 9 liquefied gas, 7 chemical tanker, 9 bulk, 1 specialized  tanker      _#_Civil air: 42 major transport aircraft      _#_Airports: 145 total, 134 usable; 53 with permanent-surface runways;  3 with runways over 3,659 m; 30 with runways 2,440-3,659 m; 66 with  runways 1,220-2,439 m      _#_Telecommunications: excellent domestic and international service in  the north, sparse in the south; 693,000 telephones; stations--26 AM, no  FM, 113 TV; 1,550,000 TV sets; 3,500,000 receiver sets; 6 submarine  cables; coaxial cable or radio relay to Italy, France, Spain, Morocco,  and Tunisia; satellite earth stations--1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT, 1  Indian Ocean INTELSAT, 1 Intersputnik, 1 ARABSAT, and 15 domestic      _*_Defense Forces  _#_Branches: Army, Navy, Air Force, Territorial Air Defense,  National Gendarmerie      _#_Manpower availability: males 15-49, 6,142,818; 3,780,873 fit for  military service; 293,175 reach military age (19) annually      _#"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25012"],[0,"The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and Selected Aphorisms. (#6)"],[1,"to-day, or in any  case the subject of greater study, than the Protean character of  degeneration which has disguised itself here, both as an art and as an  artist. In Wagner our medical men and physiologists have a most  interesting case, or at least a very complete one. Owing to the very fact  that nothing is more modern than this thorough morbidness, this  dilatoriness and excessive irritability of the nervous machinery, Wagner  is the _modern artist par excellence_, the Cagliostro of modernity. All  that the world most needs to-day, is combined in the most seductive manner  in his art,--the three great stimulants of exhausted people: _brutality_,  _artificiality_ and _innocence_ (idiocy).    Wagner is a great corrupter of music. With it, he found the means of  stimulating tired nerves,--and in this way he made music ill. In the art of  spurring exhausted creatures back into activity, and of recalling  half-corpses to life, the inventiveness he shows is of no mean order. He  is the master of hypnotic trickery, and he fells the strongest like  bullocks. Wagner's _success_--his success with nerves, and therefore with  women--converted the whole world of ambitious musicians into disciples of  his secret art. And not only the ambitious, but also the _shrewd_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Only  with morbid music can money be made to-day; our big theatres live on  Wagner.          6.      --Once more I will venture to indulge in a little levity. Let us suppose  that Wagner's _success_ could become flesh and blood and assume a human  form; that, dressed up as a good-natured musical savant, it could move  among budding artists. How do you think it would then be likely to express  itself?--    My friends, it would say, let us exchange a word or two in private. It is  easier to compose bad music than good music. But what, if apart from this  it were also more profitable, more effective, more convincing, more  exalting, more secure, more _Wagnerian_?{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} _Pulchrum est paucorum hominum._  Bad enough in all conscience! We understand Latin, and perhaps we also  understand which side our bread is buttered. Beauty has its drawbacks: we  know that. Wherefore beauty then? Why not rather aim at size, at the  sublime, the gigantic, that which moves the _masses_?--And to repeat, it is  easier to be titanic than to be beautiful; we know that.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    We know the masses, we know the theatre. The best of those who assemble  there,--German youths, horned Siegfrieds and other Wagnerites, require the  sublime, the profound, and the overwhelming. This much still lies within  our power. And as for the others who assemble there,--the cultured  _cretins_, the _blase_ pigmies, the eternally feminine, the gastrically  happy, in short the people--they also require the sublime, the profound,  the overwhelming. All these people argue in the same way. \"He who  overthrows us is strong; he who elevates us is godly; he who makes us  wonder vaguely is profound.\"--Let us make up our mind then, my friends in  music: we do want to overthrow them, we do want to elevate them, we do  want to make them wonder vaguely. This much still lies within our powers.    In regard to the process of making them wonder: it is here that our notion  of \"style\" finds its starting-point. Above all, no thoughts! Nothing is  more compromising than a thought! But the state of mind which _precedes_  thought, the labour of the thought still unborn, the promise of future  thought, the world as it was before God created it--a recrudescence of  chaos.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Chaos makes people wonder.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    In the words of the master: infinity but without melody.    In the second place, with regard to the overthrowing,--this belongs at  least in part, to physiology. Let us, in the first place, examine the  instruments. A few of them would convince even our intestines (--they  _throw open_ doors, as Handel would say), others becharm our very marrow.  The _colour of the melody is_ all-important here, _the melody itself_ is  of no importance. Let us be precise about _this_ point. To what other  purpose should we spend our strength? Let us be characteristic in tone  even to the point of foolishness! If by means of tones we allow plenty of  scope for guessing, this will be put to the credit of our intellects. Let  us irritate nerves, let us strike them dead: let us handle thunder and  lightning,--that is what overthrows.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    But what overthrows best, is _passion_.--We must try and be clear  concerning this question of passion. Nothing is cheaper than passion! All  the virtues of counterpoint may be dispensed with, there is no need to  have learnt anything,--but passion is always within our reach! Beauty is  difficult: let us beware of beauty!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And also of _melody!_ However much in  earnest we may otherwise be about the ideal, let us slander, my friends,  let us slander,--let us slander melody! Nothing is more dangerous than a  beautiful melody! Nothing is more certain to ruin taste! My friends, if  people again set about loving beautiful melodies, we are lost!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    _First principle_: melody is immoral. _Proof_: \"Palestrina\".  _Application_: \"Parsifal.\" The absence of melody is in itself  sanctifying.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    And this is the definition of passion. Passion--or the acrobatic feats of  ugliness on the tight-rope of enharmonic--My friends, let us dare to be  ugly! Wagner dared it! Let us heave the mud of the most repulsive  harmonies undauntedly before us. We must not even spare our hands! Only  thus, shall we become _natural_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    And now a last word of advice. Perhaps it covers everything--_Let us be  idealists!_--If not the cleverest, it is at least the wisest thing we can  do. In order to elevate men we ourselves must be exalted. Let us wander in  the clouds, let us harangue eternity, let us be careful to group great  symbols all around us! _Sursum! Bumbum!_--there is no better advice. The  \"heaving breast\" shall be our argument, \"beautiful feelings\" our  advocates. Virtue still carries its point against counterpoint. \"How could  he who improves us, help being better than we?\" man has ever thought thus.  Let us therefore improve mankind!--in this way we shall become good (in  this way we shall even become \"classics\"--Schiller became a \"classic\"). The  straining after the base excitement of the senses, after so-called beauty,  shattered the nerves of the Italians: let us remain German! Even Mozart's  relation to music--Wagner spoke this word of comfort to us--was at bottom  frivolous.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    Never let us acknowledge that music \"may be a recreation,\" that it may  \"enliven,\" that it may \"give pleasure.\" _Never let us give pleasure!_--we  shall be lost if people once again think of music hedonistically.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} That  belongs to the bad eighteenth century.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} On the other hand, nothing would  be more advisable (between ourselves) than a dose of--_cant, sit venia  verbo_. This imparts dignity.--And let us take care to select the precise  moment when it would be fitting to have black looks, to sigh openly, to  sigh devoutly, to flaunt grand Christian sympathy before their eyes. \"Man  is corrupt who will save him? _what will save him?_\" Do not let us reply.  We must be on our guard. We must control our ambition, which would bid us  found new religions. But no one must doubt that it is _we_ who save him,  that in _our_ music alone salvation is to be found.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} (See Wagner's essay,  \"Religion and Art.\")          7.      Enough! Enough! I fear that, beneath all my merry jests, you are beginning  to recognise the sinister truth only too clearly--the picture of the  decline of art, of the decline of the artist. The latter, which is a  decline of character, might perhaps be defined provisionally in the  following manner: the musician is now becoming an actor, his art is  developing ever more and more into a talent for _telling lies_. In a  certain chapter of my principal work which bears the title \"Concerning the  Physiology of Art,\"(9) I shall have an opportunity of showing more  thoroughly how this transformation of art as a whole into histrionics is  just as much a sign of physiological degeneration (or more precisely a  form of hysteria), as any other individual corruption, and infirmity  peculiar to the art which Wagner inaugurated: for instance the  restlessness of its optics, which makes it necessary to change one's  attitude to it every second. They understand nothing of Wagner who see in  him but a sport of nature, an arbitrary mood, a chapter of accidents. He  was not the \"defective,\" \"ill-fated,\" \"contradictory\" genius that people  have declared him to be. Wagner was something _complete_, he was a typical  _decadent_, in whom every sign of \"free will\" was lacking, in whom every  feature was necessary. If there is anything at all of interest in Wagner,  it is the consistency with which a critical physiological condition may  convert itself, step by step, conclusion after conclusion, into a method,  a form of procedure, a reform of all principles, a crisis in taste.    At this point I shall only stop to consider the question of _style_. How  is _decadence_ in _literature_ characterised? By the fact that in it life  no longer animates the whole. Words become predominant and leap right out  of the sentence to which they belong, the sentences themselves trespass  beyond their bounds, and obscure the sense of the whole page, and the page  in its turn gains in vigour at the cost of the whole,--the whole is no  longer a whole. But this is the formula for every decadent style: there is  always anarchy among the atoms, disaggregation of the will,--in moral  terms: \"freedom of the individual,\"--extended into a political theory  \"_equal_ rights for all.\" Life, equal"]]]
