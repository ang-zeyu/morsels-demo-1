When it falls the bees  should be smoked at once to prevent them rising in the air. For  good reasons I prefer to cut the tree about nine or ten o'clock in  the forenoon. After blowing a little smoke in at the entrance,  proceed to chop a hole in the tree low down on the side, then  another hole farther up or down the tree, depending on whether the  bee works up or down from the place of entrance. After this is  done, split the piece out, blow more smoke on the bees and take the  combs out. Brush the bees off, lay them on the log some distance  from the bees, place the forcing box over the main body of the bees  and by brushing and smoking drive them into it. The box should be  in an elevated position, say forty-five degrees or more, as bees  will go on the upper end much more readily when the box is in this  position. Be sure the queen is in, which can generally be  determined by the manner in which the bees enter the box. If they  are inclined to run back out after being forced in, it is a pretty  sure sign the queen is not with them. When you are sure the queen  is with them, and there is a sufficient number of bees with her,  lift the box gently off, turn it upside down and place the lid on  and fasten with a couple of tacks taken along. Now place the brood  combs back in the tree. First a comb then a couple of small sticks  crosswise to form a bee space. Continue this until all the combs  are back in the tree, and as the top part of the log was not split  off, the piece split from the side can be fit in, bark and flat  stones can be used to form a covering that will keep the rain from  getting in. By cutting the tree at this time of day thousands of  bees are out in search of nectar and when they come home and find  their home gone, will fly around in the air until becoming  exhausted, and will then settle on the leaves and bushes in bunches  and knots by the hundreds. If there was any nice white honey we  have it in the bucket and picking up the box start on the homeward  journey. Presuming we have a movable frame hive at home with an  inch of starter in the frames or, what would be better, a hive  filled with comb from the year previous, we place the hive on its  permanent stand and take the lid from the box and shake the bees  down at the entrance. For fear the queen has been left in the tree  it would be well to have an entrance guard placed on the hive, as  this would exclude the queen and as soon as the queen is seen the  guard can be removed. In a short time we can tell whether they take  kindly to their new home. The queen is a laying one and some pollen  should be taken in the following day. I always made sure I had the  queen and never had a bee so treated to swarm out after being  hived.    Now what about the bee in the tree? When we left it there were  thousands flying around and settling on the leaves and bushes,  other thousands in all stages of development in the combs. The ones  that are hanging on the bushes begin to make further investigation  and finding their brood soon cover it and with the bees hatching  out every hour soon make the colony almost as populous as it was  before the tree was cut. In taking the combs out we may have seen  some queen cells started. If so, so much the better. If not, there  certainly were eggs in some of the combs and in sixteen days at the  most they can rear a queen from these eggs. When this time has  elapsed, take your box and smoker. Take the combs out as before;  drive the bees into the box, and as the brood is nearly all hatched  out by this time you will have nearly as many bees as you got the  first time. These are brought home and treated as the first swarm  and the combs can be placed in the log again for the few remaining  bees that may have been left, to cluster on and these can be  brought home later and joined to the second swarm. By this method  you get two strong colonies from one tree. There is no help needed;  no heavy lifting and carrying of hives to and from the tree. By  following this plan you can soon have quite an apiary and be on  your way to enjoy the profits as well as the pleasures of bee  hunting. This plan is original with me and I believe it to be the  very best plan given so far, and I expect to follow it until  someone gives us something superior.    The profits of bee hunting will depend on the ability of the man to  manipulate the bees after taking them from the tree. You must agree  with me that in cutting the tree, there is nearly always some of  the combs containing honey broken up and covered with dirt, and  this honey can never be classed as salable. Therefore, if we hunt  bees merely for what honey may be in the tree and leave the bees to  perish from starvation and cold, it were far better, from a moral  and financial point of view, to let the tree stand.        CHAPTER XI.    CUSTOMS AND OWNERSHIP OF WILD BEES.    There are customs in vogue among sportsmen that have been handed  down from generation to generation, that have almost become laws.  Indeed, we have heard it said that custom becomes law.    A hunter may wound a deer, follow it for a distance and find that  another hunter has shot and killed it. The question might arise as  to whom the deer belonged. A bee hunter may find a bee tree and  mark it and some other hunter might find it afterwards and cut it.  The same question might arise as to whom it legally belonged. If  sportsmen were to settle the disputes they would refer back to  custom and say the deer belonged to the one first wounding it,  providing the wound was of such nature that the one first wounding  it would have been pretty sure of getting it, by following on, and  they would also decide that the bee belonged to the one who first  found and marked it.    A custom that may seem to be founded on justice is pretty apt to be  followed by laws that may coincide with the custom. But we must  remember there are statute laws relating to the ownership of wild  animals and bees, and though we all band together as sportsmen, we  cannot abrogate nor set aside these laws already formed.    In my boyhood days, when I would find a bee, I was very slow to  tell any one just where it was for fear they might cut it. Was this  true sportsmanship? I think not. Some other bee hunter might hunt  for that bee a day or more and finding it would have reason to say  that I had deceived him and he could hardly be blamed if he cut it.  I have been used just this very way more than once, and felt like  retaliating by cutting a bee that was found prior by another party.  But am glad to say that I never did. Since I became more mature in  years I have had more confidence in my fellow sportsmen and now  after finding a bee tree the first time I see any one who is likely  to look for the bee, he is told its exact location, thus probably  saving him much valuable time in not looking for a bee that is  found.    As a fitting close to this work it might be well to quote the  statute laws relating to the ownership of wild bees.    \"Bees while unreclaimed, are by nature wild animals. Those which  take up their abode in a tree belong to the owner of the soil, if  unreclaimed, but if reclaimed and identified, they belong to the  former owner. If a swarm leave a hive they belong to the owner as  long as they are in sight and are easily taken; otherwise they  become the property of the first occupant. Merely finding a bee on  the land of another and marking the tree does not vest the property  of the bees in the finder. _They do not become private property  until they are in a hive.\"_    This is a statute law. But true sportsmen do not think of going to  law for adjustment of these matters, but rather depend on that  fraternal spirit by which all questions relating to ownership are  settled amicably.        CHAPTER XII.    SOME OF OUR BENEFACTORS AND THEIR INVENTIONS.    Bee keeping as a source of revenue dates far back in ancient  history. With the advent of the movable frame hive and the  increased demand for honey all over the world as a source of food  supply, it received a new impetus and there are many bee keepers in  this and other countries who are not only making an honest living  in the pursuit, but have become wealthy as well.    Over half a century ago, Rev. L. L. Langstroth invented the movable  frame hive and became the benefactor of the bee-keeping fraternity.  Prior to this time there was no way of telling the condition of a  bee except what could be learned from an external diagnosis. If  from their actions we were led to believe the colony was diseased,  or that the bee moth was holding sway, there was no way by which we  could remedy the evil. But this invention gives us access at all  times to the brood chamber and we are able to see just what is  wrong and apply the proper remedy. Perhaps it is fair to add that  all bee keepers do not agree that the movable frame was invented by  Father Langstroth. This honor is conceded by many to belong to  Huber or Dzierzon, German bee keepers. Be this as it may, the  movable frame hive of today, used throughout America and many  foreign countries, is the product of the inventive genius of this  great benefactor of the bee-keeping fraternity.    The invention of many accessories since the death of Father  Langstroth, many years ago, would almost make us believe that there  is nothing further to be desired, that perfection has been reached.  But well we know that perfection cannot be reached on this earth,  and so we will look forward, knowing as time goes on that other  great minds will add to the store of knowledge now possessed by the  bee keeper, and bee keeping of the future will be as far in advance  of the present as the present is of the past.    With the help of appliances and the instruction given by able  writers in many magazines and bee papers anyone with a fair amount  of ability should be able to make a success at this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34063"],[0,"Fifty Years a Hunter and Trapper (#6)"],[1,"look after them. They were about a mile and a half from camp and  when I came in sight of the first trap I saw that I had a bear. You  may be sure that I again felt like a mighty hunter. I was more  pleased over this one bear than I was over the eight bear we had  caught when I was with Mr. Harris, because now I was the trapper and  not Mr. Harris. The bear was a good sized female. She had become fast  only a short distance from where the trap was set. I shot and skinned  the bear then cut the carcass into quarters, bent down a sapling and  hung a quarter of the bear on this. With a forked pole I raised the  sapling up until the meat was out of the way of small animals that  might happen along.    After hanging up three of the quarters in this manner, leaving one to  take to camp, I took the lungs and liver and put them in the bait  pen. The bait had all been eaten and I was quite sure it had been  done after the bear was caught, as a bear immediately loses its  appetite after placing its foot in a good, strong trap. I really  expected to find another bear in one of the other traps as they were  not far away, but the other traps were undisturbed.    The next morning I thought I would take some bait from camp and bait  the trap where I had put the offals from the bear, fearing that  should a bear come along it might not eat the bait that was in the  pen. You may imagine my surprise when I came in sight of the trap to  see another bear fast in the trap.    After killing the bear I removed the entrails and started to carry  the bear to camp. It was a cub and I could carry it without cutting  it in parts. I was just about to start for camp when I decided I  would go to the other traps. If I was surprised at seeing the first  cub, I was doubly so, for there was another cub tangled up in the  trap. Do you think I felt gay? Well, that was no name for it.    I shot this cub and without waiting to dress it I took a lively gait  to the other trap to see if there were any more bears but there was  nothing there. The last two bears, I think were the cubs of the old  bear that I had caught the night before. I spent the entire day  getting the bears to camp. I did not get any more bear for some time  although I had an opportunity to learn a whole lot about them.    Some days after I got the old bear and the cubs, I found the bait pen  in one of the traps torn down by a bear, which had taken the bait and  had not sprung the trap. Right here I will say that I learned a great  deal more about the habits of Bruin. After finding the bait gone I  thought that all I would have to do was to make the bait pen a little  stronger so Bruin could not tear it down so readily to get at the  bait. I did not think that a bear knew anything about \"trapology,\"  for the experience I had so far in bear trapping was that bears knew  but little more about a trap than a hog, though later I found I was  very much mistaken.      [Illustration: SETTING A LARGE STEEL TRAP FOR BEAR.]    The trap was set in a small brook where there were plenty of rocks of  all sizes. I rolled several of these rocks, as large as I could  handle, up about the bait pen to strengthen it to such an extent that  Bruin would not think of tearing it down. I figured the bear by going  over the trap would take the bait from the entrance of the pen as a  good bear should; though in this I was greatly mistaken. The second  day I went to the trap with full expectation of finding Bruin fast in  the trap, but again I was disappointed--Bruin had again gone to the  back of the pen and torn the top of the pen off, rolling away some of  the stones, taking the bait.    Now I saw that if I was to get my friend Bruin, I would have to work  a little strategy. I removed the trap from the clog, leaving the clog  undisturbed and making all appear just the same as it did when the  trap was set. I was very careful to have the covering of the trap  left just the same as when the trap was set. Then I got another clog  and set the trap at the back of the pen at the place where the bear  had torn off the top of the bait pen. Here I concealed the trap and  clog as completely as I knew how and being very careful to make all  appear just as before the trap was set, flattering myself that Bruin  would surely put his foot in it this time.    I went early the next morning, being sure that I would find Bruin,  but no bear had been there. I went again early the next morning with  high expectations of finding Bruin waiting for me, but again nothing  had been disturbed. Thinking that Bruin had left that locality  altogether, or that he would not be back again for several days, I  thought I would go and have a team come and take out the furs and  game I had, and give Bruin time to get back after more bait. As I had  caught no bear at the other traps, I felt quite certain that Bruin  was still somewhere in the neighborhood and would be around again  after more bait.    When I reached home an old gentleman by the name of Nelson who was a  noted hunter and trapper and who lived near us, came to see me. Let  me explain who this Mr. Nelson was, as I shall have more to say of  him.    Mr. Nelson was one of the early settlers in this county, moving here  at an early date from Washington County, New York State. He was known  here as Uncle Horatio and by many as Squire Nelson, as he was a  Justice of the Peace here for thirty years.    Mr. Nelson would always come to our house as soon as he found that I  was at home, to see what luck I had in the way of trapping and  hunting. On this occasion, Mr. Nelson, or Uncle Horatio, as we always  called him, was soon over to learn what luck I had and when I told  him what sort of a time I had trying to outwit the bear, he said I  had better build a deadfall and let the bear kill himself. Uncle said  that Bruin would give me much trouble and was likely to leave and I  would not get him at all. This idea I did not like, for I had, before  this, been put to my wit's end to outwit a cunning old fox, but  finally succeeded in catching him and I thought I could outwit such a  dumb thing as a bear. I thought if I could not get the bear in a  steel trap, there would be but little use trying to get him in such a  clumsy thing as a deadfall--however, Uncle had trapped bear long  before I was born and knew what he was talking about.    As soon as I got back to camp I went to the bear trap to relieve  Bruin of his troubles, but it was not the bear that was in trouble,  but myself, for Bruin had been there and torn out a stone at one side  of the pen and had taken the bait. Well, the case was getting  desperate, so I got another trap and set it at the side where the  bear took the bait the last time, taking all the pains possible in  setting the trap, but the result was no better than before.    I had made it a habit to hang on a small bait near the bear traps,  believing that the bear would be attracted by the scent of the bait  hanging up from the ground more than it would from the bait in the  pen. At this trap I had hung up the bait in a bush that extended out  from the bank over the brook and each time the bear had taken this  bait. I now took one of the traps at the pen, leaving the clog and  all appearances as though the trap still remained there. Getting  another clog I concealed it under the edge of the bank and set the  trap under the bait that I had hung in the bush. I was certain this  time that I would outwit Bruin, but instead, the bear went onto the  bank, pulled the bush around, took the bait and went about his  business. Now I was getting pretty excited and began to think of the  advice of Uncle Horatio but I was not willing to give up yet.    Up the brook, fifty or sixty feet from the bait pen, there had fallen  a small, bushy hemlock tree which stood on the right hand bank of the  spring, and the top of the tree reached nearly over to the opposite  bank. I had noticed that when the bear had come to the trap he had  come down the brook and went back the same way. The water was shallow  in the brook, barely covering the stones and fallen leaves all over  the bed of the brook. Going to the top of the hemlock tree, I saw  that the bear had passed between the top of this tree and the bank of  the brook. Here was a fine place to conceal the trap and I said, \"Old  fellow, here I will surely outwit you.\" I took the trap from the bait  pen and set it in the open space between the top of the tree and  concealing all the very best I could, I again put more bait in the  bait pen and hung up more on the bush.    I waited two days and then went to the traps again, wondering all the  way what the result would be. Well, it was the same as before. The  bear had gone to the bush on the bank, taken the bait, and had also  taken the bait from the bait pen as usual. Now I thought it quite  time to try Uncle's plan, though I had but little faith in it.    It was several miles to Mr. Haskins', the nearest house, but I lost  no time in getting there for I was now feeling desperate. Mr. Haskins  readily consented to help me build a deadfall. We cut a beech tree  that was about fourteen inches through, that stood back in thick  undergrowth some rods from the bait pen. We cut a portion about four  feet long from the large end of the tree for the bed-piece and  placing it against the small tree for one of the stakes. With levers  we placed the tree on top of the bed-piece and with three other good  stakes driven at each side of the logs fastened the tops of the  stakes together with withes to strengthen them, we soon had a good,  strong deadfall made, as every boy who is a reader of the H-T-T,  knows how to build. We baited the trap and set it, getting done in  time for Mr. Haskins to get home before dark.    I again put bait back in the bait pen and on the bush as before and  patiently awaited results. The second day I looked after the traps  but there were no signs of bear being about either"]]]
