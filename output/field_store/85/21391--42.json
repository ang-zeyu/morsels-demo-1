The silly selfishness of short-sighted mortals, is never more extremely  absurd than in their unprofitable parsimony of what is of no use to  them, but would be of actual value to others, who, in return, would  willingly repay them tenfold. However, I hope I may be permitted to  quote, in defence of these culinary professors, a couple of lines of a  favourite old song:        \"If you search the world round, each profession, you'll find,      Hath some snug little secrets, which the Mystery[30-*] they call.\"    MY RECEIPTS are the results of experiments carefully made, and  accurately and circumstantially related;    The TIME requisite for dressing being stated;    The QUANTITIES of the various articles contained in each composition  being carefully set down in NUMBER, WEIGHT, and MEASURE.    The WEIGHTS are _avoirdupois_; the MEASURE, _Lyne's_ graduated glass, i.  e. a wine-pint divided into sixteen ounces, and the ounce into eight  drachms. By a _wine-glass_ is to be understood two ounces liquid  measure; by a large or _table-spoonful_, half an ounce; by a small or  _tea-spoonful_, a drachm, or half a quarter of an ounce, i. e. nearly  equal to two drachms avoirdupois.    At some glass warehouses, you may get measures divided into tea and  table-spoons. No cook should be without one, who wishes to be regular in  her business.    This precision has never before been attempted in cookery books, but I  found it indispensable from the impossibility of _guessing_ the  quantities intended by such obscure expressions as have been usually  employed for this purpose in former works:--    For instance: a bit of this--a handful of that--a pinch of t'other--do  'em over with an egg--and a sprinkle of salt--a dust of flour--a shake  of pepper--a squeeze of lemon,--or a dash of vinegar, &c. are the  constant phrases. Season it to your palate, (meaning the cook's,) is  another form of speech: now, if she has any, (it is very unlikely that  it is in unison with that of her employers,) by continually sipping  _piquante_ relishes, it becomes blunted and insensible, and loses the  faculty of appreciating delicate flavours, so that every thing is done  at random.    These culinary technicals are so very differently understood by the  learned who write them, and the unlearned who read them, and their  \"_rule of thumb_\" is so extremely indefinite, that if the same dish be  dressed by different persons, it will generally be so different, that  nobody would imagine they had worked from the same directions, which  will assist a person who has not served a regular apprenticeship in the  kitchen, no more than reading \"Robinson Crusoe\" would enable a sailor to  steer safely from England to India.[32-*]    It is astonishing how cheap _cookery books_ are held by practical cooks:  when I applied to an experienced artist to recommend me some books that  would give me a notion of the rudiments of cookery, he replied, with a  smile, \"You may read _Don Quixote_, or _Peregrine Pickle_, they are both  very good books.\"    Careless expressions in cookery are the more surprising, as the  confectioner is regularly attentive, in the description of his  preparations, to give the exact quantities, though his business,  compared to cookery, is as unimportant as the ornamental is inferior to  the useful.    The maker of blanc-mange, custards, &c. and the endless and useless  collection of puerile playthings for the palate (of first and second  childhood, for the vigour of manhood seeketh not to be sucking sugar, or  sipping turtle), is scrupulously exact, even to a grain, in his  ingredients; while cooks are unintelligibly indefinite, although they  are intrusted with the administration of our FOOD, upon the proper  quality and preparation of which, all our powers of body and mind  depend; their energy being invariably in the ratio of the performance of  the restorative process, i. e. the quantity, quality, and perfect  digestion of what we eat and drink.    Unless _the stomach_ be in good humour, every part of the machinery of  _life_ must vibrate with languor: can we then be too attentive to its  adjustment?!!      CULINARY CURIOSITIES.         The following specimen of the unaccountably whimsical harlequinade       of foreign kitchens is from \"La Chapelle\" Nouveau Cuisinier, Paris,       1748.         \"A turkey,\" in the shape of \"_football_,\" or \"_a hedge-hog_.\" A       \"shoulder of mutton,\" in the shape of a \"_bee-hive_.\"--\"Entree of       pigeons,\" in the form of a \"_spider_,\" or _sun_-fashion, or \"in the       form of a _frog_,\" or, in \"the form of the _moon_.\"--Or, \"to make       a pig taste like a wild boar;\" take _a living pig_, and _let him_       swallow the following drink, viz. boil together in vinegar and       water, some rosemary, thyme, sweet basil, bay leaves, and sage;       when you have _let him_ swallow this, _immediately whip him to       death_, and roast him forthwith.

But the most extraordinary of all the culinary receipts that have       been under my eye, is the following diabolically cruel directions       of Mizald, \"_how to roast and eat a goose alive_.\" \"Take a GOOSE or       a DUCK, or some such _lively creature_, (but a goose is best of all       for this purpose,) pull off all her feathers, only the head and       neck must be spared: then make a fire round about her, not too       close to her, that the smoke do not choke her, and that the fire       may not burn her too soon; nor too far off, that she may not escape       free: within the circle of the fire let there be set small cups and       pots full of water, wherein salt and honey are mingled: and let       there be set also chargers full of sodden apples, cut into small       pieces in the dish. The goose must be all larded, and basted over       with butter, to make her the more fit to be eaten, and may roast       the better: put then fire about her, but do not make too much       haste, when as you see her begin to roast; for by walking about,       and flying here and there, being cooped in by the fire that stops       her way out, the unwearied goose is kept in; she will fall to drink       the water to quench her thirst and cool her heart, and all her       body, and the apple-sauce will make her dung, and cleanse and empty       her. And when she roasteth, and consumes inwardly, always wet her       head and heart with a wet sponge; and when you see her giddy with       running, and begin to stumble, her heart wants moisture, and she is       roasted enough. Take her up, set her before your guests, and she       will cry as you cut off any part from her, and will be almost eaten       up before she be dead; it is mighty pleasant to behold!!\"--See       WECKER'S _Secrets of Nature_, in folio, London, 1660, p. 148.       309.[33-*]         \"We suppose Mr. Mizald stole this receipt from the kitchen of his       infernal majesty; probably it might have been one of the dishes the       devil ordered when he invited Nero and Caligula to a feast.\"--_A.

Many articles were in vogue in the 14th century, which are now       obsolete. We add the following specimens of the CULINARY AFFAIRS OF       DAYS OF YORE.         _Sauce for a goose, A.D. 1381._         \"Take a faire panne, and set hit under the goose whill she rostes;       and kepe clene the grese that droppes thereof, and put thereto a       godele (good deal) of Wyn, and a litel vinegur, and verjus, and       onyons mynced, or garlek; then take the gottes (gut) of the goose       and slitte hom, and scrape hom clene in water and salt, and so wash       hom, and hack hom small, then do all this togedur in a piffenet       (pipkin), and do thereto raisinges of corance, and pouder of pepur       and of ginger, and of canell and hole clowes and maces, and let hit       boyle and serve hit forthe.\"         \"That unwieldy marine animal the PORPUS was dressed in a variety of       modes, salted, roasted, stewed, &c.

He appeared angry, and the longer he  looked the angrier he grew.    \"Those are my oysters,\" he said at last. \"I know they are my oysters.  You raided my beds last night and robbed me of them.\"    The tall man and the short man on the _Ghost_ looked up.    \"Hello, Taft,\" the short man said, with insolent familiarity. (Among  the bayfarers he had gained the nickname of \"The Centipede\" on account  of his long arms.) \"Hello, Taft,\" he repeated, with the same touch of  insolence. \"Wot 'r you growlin' about now?\"    \"Those are my oysters--that's what I said. You've stolen them from my  beds.\"    \"Yer mighty wise, ain't ye?\" was the Centipede's sneering reply. \"S'pose  you can tell your oysters wherever you see 'em?\"    \"Now, in my experience,\" broke in the tall man, \"oysters is oysters  wherever you find 'em, an' they're pretty much alike all the Bay over,  and the world over, too, for that matter. We're not wantin' to quarrel  with you, Mr. Taft, but we jes' wish you wouldn't insinuate that them  oysters is yours an' that we're thieves an' robbers till you can prove  the goods.\"    \"I know they're mine; I'd stake my life on it!\" Mr. Taft snorted.    \"Prove it,\" challenged the tall man, who we afterward learned was known  as \"The Porpoise\" because of his wonderful swimming abilities.    Mr. Taft shrugged his shoulders helplessly. Of course he could not prove  the oysters to be his, no matter how certain he might be.    \"I'd give a thousand dollars to have you men behind the bars!\" he cried.  \"I'll give fifty dollars a head for your arrest and conviction, all of  you!\"    A roar of laughter went up from the different boats, for the rest of the  pirates had been listening to the discussion.    \"There's more money in oysters,\" the Porpoise remarked dryly.    Mr. Taft turned impatiently on his heel and walked away. From out of the  corner of his eye, Charley noted the way he went. Several minutes later,  when he had disappeared around a corner, Charley rose lazily to his  feet. I followed him, and we sauntered off in the opposite direction to  that taken by Mr. Taft.    \"Come on! Lively!\" Charley whispered, when we passed from the view of  the oyster fleet.    Our course was changed at once, and we dodged around corners and raced  up and down side-streets till Mr. Taft's generous form loomed up ahead  of us.    \"I'm going to interview him about that reward,\" Charley explained, as  we rapidly overhauled the oyster-bed owner. \"Neil will be delayed here  for a week, and you and I might as well be doing something in the  meantime. What do you say?\"    \"Of course, of course,\" Mr. Taft said, when Charley had introduced  himself and explained his errand. \"Those thieves are robbing me of  thousands of dollars every year, and I shall be glad to break them up at  any price,--yes, sir, at any price. As I said, I'll give fifty dollars a  head, and call it cheap at that. They've robbed my beds, torn down my  signs, terrorized my watchmen, and last year killed one of them.  Couldn't prove it. All done in the blackness of night. All I had was a  dead watchman and no evidence. The detectives could do nothing. Nobody  has been able to do anything with those men. We have never succeeded in  arresting one of them. So I say, Mr.---- What did you say your name  was?\"    \"Le Grant,\" Charley answered.    \"So I say, Mr. Le Grant, I am deeply obliged to you for the assistance  you offer. And I shall be glad, most glad, sir, to co-operate with you  in every way. My watchmen and boats are at your disposal. Come and see  me at the San Francisco offices any time, or telephone at my expense.  And don't be afraid of spending money. I'll foot your expenses,  whatever they are, so long as they are within reason. The situation is  growing desperate, and something must be done to determine whether I or  that band of ruffians own those oyster beds.\"    \"Now we'll see Neil,\" Charley said, when he had seen Mr. Taft upon his  train to San Francisco.    Not only did Neil Partington interpose no obstacle to our adventure, but  he proved to be of the greatest assistance. Charley and I knew nothing  of the oyster industry, while his head was an encyclopaedia of facts  concerning it. Also, within an hour or so, he was able to bring to us a  Greek boy of seventeen or eighteen who knew thoroughly well the ins and  outs of oyster piracy.    At this point I may as well explain that we of the fish patrol were  free lances in a way. While Neil Partington, who was a patrolman proper,  received a regular salary, Charley and I, being merely deputies,  received only what we earned--that is to say, a certain percentage of  the fines imposed on convicted violators of the fish laws. Also, any  rewards that chanced our way were ours. We offered to share with  Partington whatever we should get from Mr. Taft, but the patrolman  would not hear of it. He was only too happy, he said, to do a good turn  for us, who had done so many for him.    We held a long council of war, and mapped out the following line of  action. Our faces were unfamiliar on the Lower Bay, but as the  _Reindeer_ was well known as a fish-patrol sloop, the Greek boy, whose  name was Nicholas, and I were to sail some innocent-looking craft down  to Asparagus Island and join the oyster pirates' fleet. Here,  according to Nicholas's description of the beds and the manner of  raiding, it was possible for us to catch the pirates in the act of  stealing oysters, and at the same time to get them in our power.  Charley was to be on the shore, with Mr. Taft's watchmen and a posse  of constables, to help us at the right time.    \"I know just the boat,\" Neil said, at the conclusion of the  discussion, \"a crazy old sloop that's lying over at Tiburon. You and  Nicholas can go over by the ferry, charter it for a song, and sail  direct for the beds.\"    \"Good luck be with you, boys,\" he said at parting, two days later.  \"Remember, they are dangerous men, so be careful.\"    Nicholas and I succeeded in chartering the sloop very cheaply; and  between laughs, while getting up sail, we agreed that she was even  crazier and older than she had been described. She was a big,  flat-bottomed, square-sterned craft, sloop-rigged, with a sprung mast,  slack rigging, dilapidated sails, and rotten running-gear, clumsy to  handle and uncertain in bringing about, and she smelled vilely of coal  tar, with which strange stuff she had been smeared from stem to stern  and from cabin-roof to centreboard. And to cap it all, _Coal Tar  Maggie_ was printed in great white letters the whole length of either  side.    It was an uneventful though laughable run from Tiburon to Asparagus  Island, where we arrived in the afternoon of the following day. The  oyster pirates, a fleet of a dozen sloops, were lying at anchor on  what was known as the \"Deserted Beds.\" The _Coal Tar Maggie_ came  sloshing into their midst with a light breeze astern, and they crowded  on deck to see us. Nicholas and I had caught the spirit of the crazy  craft, and we handled her in most lubberly fashion.    \"Wot is it?\" some one called.    \"Name it 'n' ye kin have it!\" called another.    \"I swan naow, ef it ain't the old Ark itself!\" mimicked the Centipede  from the deck of the _Ghost_.    \"Hey! Ahoy there, clipper ship!\" another wag shouted. \"Wot's yer  port?\"    We took no notice of the joking, but acted, after the manner of  greenhorns, as though the _Coal Tar Maggie_ required our undivided  attention. I rounded her well to windward of the _Ghost_, and Nicholas  ran for'ard to drop the anchor. To all appearances it was a bungle,  the way the chain tangled and kept the anchor from reaching the  bottom. And to all appearances Nicholas and I were terribly excited as  we strove to clear it. At any rate, we quite deceived the pirates, who  took huge delight in our predicament.    [Illustration: \"The Centipede and the Porpoise doubled up on the cabin  in paroxysms of laughter.\"]    But the chain remained tangled, and amid all kinds of mocking advice  we drifted down upon and fouled the _Ghost_, whose bowsprit poked  square through our mainsail and ripped a hole in it as big as a barn  door. The Centipede and the Porpoise doubled up on the cabin in  paroxysms of laughter, and left us to get clear as best we could.  This, with much unseamanlike performance, we succeeded in doing, and  likewise in clearing the anchor-chain, of which we let out about three  hundred feet. With only ten feet of water under us, this would permit  the _Coal Tar Maggie_ to swing in a circle six hundred feet in  diameter, in which circle she would be able to foul at least half the  fleet.    The oyster pirates lay snugly together at short hawsers, the weather  being fine, and they protested loudly at our ignorance in putting out  such an unwarranted length of anchor-chain. And not only did they  protest, for they made us heave it in again, all but thirty feet.    Having sufficiently impressed them with our general lubberliness,  Nicholas and I went below to congratulate ourselves and to cook  supper. Hardly had we finished the meal and washed the dishes, when a  skiff ground against the _Coal Tar Maggie's_ side, and heavy feet  trampled on deck. Then the Centipede's brutal face appeared in the  companionway, and he descended into the cabin, followed by the  Porpoise. Before they could seat themselves on a bunk, another skiff  came alongside, and another, and another, till the whole fleet was  represented by the gathering in the cabin.    \"Where'd you swipe the old tub?\" asked a squat and hairy man, with  cruel eyes and Mexican features.    \"Didn't swipe it,\" Nicholas answered, meeting them on their own ground  and encouraging the idea that we had stolen the _Coal Tar Maggie_.  \"And if we did, what of it?\"    \"Well, I don't admire your taste, that's all,\" sneered he of the  Mexican"]]]
