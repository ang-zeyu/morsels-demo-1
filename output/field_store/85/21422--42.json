If the obstructing substance is hard, this will be a dangerous  operation, but if soft--as in the case of a ripe pear, for example--this  procedure may be safely adopted.    In all cases, if pressure applied on the neck fails to move the obstruction  and the probang also fails to move it, it may be divided by a subcutaneous  operation, or the gullet may be opened and the obstructing substance  removed through the wound. In such cases the assistance of a veterinarian  or a surgeon must be obtained.      WOUNDS AND INJURIES OF THE GULLET.    Sometimes the walls of the gullet may be more or less lacerated or abraded  by the rash and too forcible use of the probang, and the animal  consequently swallows with pain and difficulty. In such cases dry feed must  be withheld for five or six days, so as to allow the injured parts to heal,  and the diet must be limited to linseed tea, hay tea, and thin oatmeal  gruel and molasses. The same kind of diet must be fed after the operation  of cutting into the gullet has been performed.    Sometimes the gullet is ruptured and lacerated to such an extent that  treatment of any kind is hopeless. This has been known to occur when the  handle of a pitchfork or buggy whip has been pushed down a cow's throat to  remove an obstruction. When such treatment has been applied it is best to  slaughter the animal without delay, as the flesh may be utilized so long as  there is no fever or general disease, and remedial treatment would be  hopeless. In this connection it may be mentioned that whatever substitute  may be used for a probang, which sometimes is not at hand, it should be  flexible and should possess a smooth surface. A piece of new rope, with the  end closely wrapped and waxed and then oiled, or a piece of thin garden  hose, or a well-wrapped twisted wire may be used in emergencies.      DISEASES OF THE STOMACHS.    ACUTE TYMPANITES (HOVEN, OR BLOATING).    Tympanites is a distention of the rumen or paunch with gases of  fermentation, and is manifested outwardly by swelling in the region of the  left flank.    _Causes._--Tympanites may be caused by any kind of feed which produces  indigestion. When cattle are first turned into young clover they eat so  greedily of it that tympanites frequently results. Turnips, potatoes,  cabbage, or the discarded pulp from sugar-beet factories may also cause it.  Middlings and corn meal also frequently give rise to it.    Care is necessary in turning animals into fields of clover or stubble  fields in which there is a strong growth of volunteer grain. It is always  better to keep them from such pasturage while it is wet with dew, and they  should be taken out when they have eaten a moderate quantity. When cattle  are fed upon pulp from sugar beets, germinated malt, etc., they should be  fed in moderate amounts until they have become accustomed to it, as any of  these feeds may give rise to severe bloating.    An excessive quantity of any of the before-mentioned feeds may bring on  this disorder, or it may not be caused by excess, but to eating too  hastily. Sometimes the quality of the feed is at fault. Grass or clover  when wet by dew or rain frequently disorders digestion and brings on  tympanites; frozen roots or pastures covered with hoar frost should also be  regarded as dangerous. When feed has been eaten too hastily, or when it is  cold and wet, the digestive process is imperfectly performed, and the feed  contained in the paunch ferments, during which process large quantities of  gas are formed. The same result may follow when a cow is choked, as the  obstruction in the gullet prevents the eructation or passing up of gas from  the stomach, so that the gas continues to accumulate until tympanites  results.    _Symptoms._--The swelling of the left flank is very characteristic, as in  well-marked cases the flank at its upper part rises above the level of the  backbone, and when struck with the tips of the fingers emits a drum-like  sound. The animal has an anxious expression, moves uneasily, and is  evidently distressed. If relief is not obtained in time, it breathes with  difficulty, reels in walking or in standing, and in a short time falls and  dies from suffocation. The distention of the stomach may become so great as  to prevent the animal from breathing, and in some instances the case may be  complicated by rupture of the stomach.    _Treatment._--If the case is not extreme, it may be sufficient to drive the  animal at a walk for a quarter or half an hour; or cold water by the  bucketful may be thrown against the cow's sides. In some cases the  following simple treatment is successful: A rope or a twisted straw band is  coated with pine tar, wagon grease, or other unsavory substance and is  placed in the cow's mouth as a bit, being secured by tying behind the  horns. The efforts of the animal to dislodge this object result in  movements of the tongue, jaws, and throat that stimulate the secretion of  saliva and swallowing, thus opening the esophagus, which permits the exit  of gas and at the same time peristalsis is stimulated reflexly.    In urgent cases the gas must be allowed to escape without delay, and this  is best accomplished by the use of the trocar. The trocar is a  sharp-pointed instrument incased in a cannula or sheath, which leaves the  sharp point of the trocar free. (See Pl. III, figs. _5a_ and _5b._) In  selecting the point for using the trocar a spot on the left side equally  distant from the last rib, the hip bone, and the transverse processes of  the lumbar vertebrae must be chosen. Here an incision about three-fourths  of an inch long should be made with a knife through the skin, and then the  sharp point of the trocar, being directed downward, inward, and slightly  forward, is thrust into the paunch. (Pl. I.) The cannula or sheath of the  trocar should be left in the paunch so long as any gas continues to issue  from it. If the cannula is removed while gas is still forming in the paunch  and the left flank becomes considerably swollen, it may be necessary to  insert it again. It is well, accordingly, to observe the cannula closely,  and if gas is found to be issuing from it, it should not be removed. When  gas issues from it in considerable quantities the sound accompanying its  escape renders the exact condition obvious. It is occasionally necessary to  keep the cannula in the stomach for several hours. When this is necessary a  piece of stout cord should be passed round the neck of the cannula  immediately below the projecting rim and then be passed round the animal's  body and tied in a secure knot, and a careful attendant must remain with  the cow during the entire period that the instrument is in place. The rim  surrounding the mouth of the cannula should be in contact with the skin.  Whenever the person in charge of the cow is convinced that gas has ceased  to issue from the cannula the instrument should be removed.    The trocar is to be used only in extreme or urgent cases, though everyone  who has had experience in treating indigestion in cattle realizes that he  has saved the lives of many animals by its prompt application.    When the tympanitic animal is not distressed and the swelling of the flank  is not great, or when the most distressing condition has been removed by  the use of the trocar, it is best to use internal medicine. Two ounces of  aromatic spirits of ammonia should be given every half hour in a quart of  cold water; or half an ounce of chlorid of lime may be dissolved in a pint  of tepid water and the dose repeated every half hour until the bloating has  subsided; or 1 ounce of creolin in 2 quarts of tepid water may be given at  one dose or carefully injected through the cannula directly into the paunch  to stop fermentation and the consequent formation of gas. It is generally  necessary to give a moderate dose of purgative medicine after bloating has  subsided, as animals frequently show symptoms of constipation after attacks  of indigestion. For this purpose 1 pound of Glauber's salt may be used.    The animal should be fed carefully upon easily digested food for several  days after the bloating has subsided, so that all fermenting matter may  pass out of the stomach.      CHRONIC TYMPANITES.    Cattle, especially those that have been kept in the stable all winter, are  liable to suffer from chronic tympanites. In this form they bloat up after  feeding, but seldom swell so much as to cause any alarm. The chronic form  of indigestion may also follow an acute attack like that previously  described. This is also a symptom of tuberculosis when the lymphatic glands  lying between the lungs are so enlarged as to press upon and partly occlude  the esophagus. It may develop in calves as a result of the formation of  hair balls in the stomach.    _Treatment._--Treatment should be preceded by a moderate dose of purgative  medicine: 1 pound of sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salt) or sulphate of soda  (Glauber's salt), half an ounce of powdered Barbados aloes, 1 ounce of  powdered ginger, 1 pint of molasses. The salts and aloes should be  dissolved by stirring for a few minutes in 2 quarts of lukewarm water, then  the molasses should be added, and after all the ingredients have been  stirred together for about 10 minutes the dose should be administered.  After the operation of the purgative it is generally necessary to give some  tonic and antacid preparation to promote digestion, which is imperfectly  performed in such cases. The following may be used: Powdered gentian, 3  ounces; powdered bicarbonate of potash, 3 ounces; powdered ginger, 3  ounces; powdered capsicum, 1 ounce. Mix and divide into 12 powders, one of  which should be given three times a day before feeding, shaken up with a  pint and a half of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#6)"],[1,"  Kingdom, by breaking the original Contract between King and People, and  having, by the advice of Jesuits, and other wicked persons, violated  the fundamental Laws, and withdrawn himself out of this Kingdom, has  abdicated the Government, and that the throne is hereby vacant.\"  These theories were developed by Jean Jacques Rousseau in his \"Contrat  Social\"--a book so attractively written that it eclipsed all other works  upon the subject and resulted in his being regarded as the author of the  doctrine--and through him they spread all over Europe.    Conditions in America did more than lend color to pale speculation; they  seemed to take this hypothesis out of the realm of theory and to give it  practical application. What happened when men went into the wilderness  to live? The Pilgrim Fathers on board the Mayflower entered into an  agreement which was signed by the heads of families who took part in the  enterprise: \"We, whose names are underwritten... Do by these presents,  solemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and one another, covenant  and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick.\"    Other colonies, especially in New England, with this example before  them of a social contract entered into similar compacts or \"plantation  covenants,\" as they were called. But the colonists were also accustomed  to having written charters granted which continued for a time at least  to mark the extent of governmental powers. Through this intermingling  of theory and practice it was the most natural thing in the world, when  Americans came to form their new State Governments, that they should  provide written instruments framed by their own representatives,  which not only bound them to be governed in this way but also placed  limitations upon the governing bodies. As the first great series  of written constitutions, these frames of government attracted wide  attention. Congress printed a set for general distribution, and numerous  editions were circulated both at home and abroad.    The constitutions were brief documents, varying from one thousand to  twelve thousand words in length, which established the framework of the  governmental machinery. Most of them, before proceeding to practical  working details, enunciated a series of general principles upon the  subject of government and political morality in what were called  declarations or bills of rights. The character of these declarations may  be gathered from the following excerpts:    \"That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have  certain inherent rights,... the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the  means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining  happiness and safety. That no man, or set of men, are entitled to  exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but  in consideration of public services.    \"The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals;  it is a social compact by which the whole people covenants with each  citizen and each citizen with the whole people that all shall be  governed by certain laws for the common good.    \"That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any  authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is  injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.    \"That general warrants,... are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to  be granted.    \"All penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offence.    \"That sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is consistent with  the safety of the State; and no law, to inflict cruel and unusual pains  and penalties, ought to be made in any case, or at any time hereafter.    \"No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties,  impose excessive fines....    \"Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God  according to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason; ...    \"That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty,  and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.\"    It will be perceived at once that these are but variations of the  English Declaration of Rights of 1689, which indeed was consciously  followed as a model; and yet there is a world-wide difference between  the English model and these American copies. The earlier document  enunciated the rights of English subjects, the recent infringement of  which made it desirable that they should be reasserted in convincing  form. The American documents asserted rights which the colonists  generally had enjoyed and which they declared to be \"governing  principles for all peoples in all future times.\"    But the greater significance of these State Constitutions is to be found  in their quality as working instruments of government. There was  indeed little difference between the old colonial and the new State  Governments. The inhabitants of each of the Thirteen States had been  accustomed to a large measure of self-government, and when they took  matters into their own hands they were not disposed to make any radical  changes in the forms to which they had become accustomed. Accordingly  the State Governments that were adopted simply continued a framework of  government almost identical with that of colonial times. To be sure, the  Governor and other appointed officials were now elected either by the  people or the legislature, and so were ultimately responsible to the  electors instead of to the Crown; and other changes were made which in  the long run might prove of far-reaching and even of vital significance;  and yet the machinery of government seemed the same as that to which  the people were already accustomed. The average man was conscious of no  difference at all in the working of the Government under the new order.  In fact, in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most democratic of all  the colonies, where the people had been privileged to elect their own  governors, as well as legislatures, no change whatever was necessary and  the old charters were continued as State Constitutions down to 1818 and  1842, respectively.    To one who has been accustomed to believe that the separation from a  monarchical government meant the establishment of democracy, a reading  of these first State Constitutions is likely to cause a rude shock.  A shrewd English observer, traveling a generation later in the United  States, went to the root of the whole matter in remarking of the  Americans that, \"When their independence was achieved their mental  condition was not instantly changed. Their deference for rank and for  judicial and legislative authority continued nearly unimpaired.\"* They  might declare that \"all men are created equal,\" and bills of rights  might assert that government rested upon the consent of the governed;  but these constitutions carefully provided that such consent should  come from property owners, and, in many of the States, from religious  believers and even followers of the Christian faith. \"The man of small  means might vote, but none save well-to-do Christians could legislate,  and in many states none but a rich Christian could be a governor.\"** In  South Carolina, for example, a freehold of 10,000 pounds currency was  required of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and members of A he  Council; 2,000 pounds of the members of the Senate; and, while every  elector was eligible to the House of Representatives, he had to  acknowledge the being of a God and to believe in a future state of  rewards and punishments, as well as to hold \"a freehold at least of  fifty acres of land, or a town lot.\"           * George Combe, \"Tour of the United States,\" vol. I, p. 205.           ** McMaster, \"Acquisition of Industrial, Popular, and Political  Rights of Man in America,\" p. 20.      It was government by a property-owning class, but in comparison with  other countries this class represented a fairly large and increasing  proportion of the population. In America the opportunity of becoming a  property-owner was open to every one, or, as that phrase would then  have been understood, to most white men. This system of class control is  illustrated by the fact that, with the exception of Massachusetts, the  new State Constitutions were never submitted to the people for approval.    The democratic sympathizer of today is inclined to point to those  first State Governments as a continuance of the old order. But to the  conservative of that time it seemed as if radical and revolutionary  changes were taking place. The bills of rights declared, \"That no men,  or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or  privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services.\"  Property qualifications and other restrictions on officeholding and the  exercise of the suffrage were lessened. Four States declared in their  constitutions against the entailment of estates, and primogeniture  was abolished in aristocratic Virginia. There was a fairly complete  abolition of all vestiges of feudal tenure in the holding of land, so  that it may be said that in this period full ownership of property was  established. The further separation of church and state was also carried  out.    Certainly leveling influences were at work, and the people as a whole  had moved one step farther in the direction of equality and democracy,  and it was well that the Revolution was not any more radical and  revolutionary than it was. The change was gradual and therefore more  lasting. One finds readily enough contemporary statements to the effect  that, \"Although there are no nobles in America, there is a class of men  denominated 'gentlemen,' who, by reason of their wealth, their talents,  their education, their families, or the offices they hold, aspire to a  preeminence,\" but, the same observer adds, this is something which  \"the people refuse to grant them.\" Another contemporary contributes the  observation that"]]]
