[Illustration: \"TWISTED IT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS, AND LET IT DRAG BEHIND  HIM.\"]    While all this cutting and hauling was going on, the big beaver down  at the head of the canal was attending strictly to his task, running  his lines straight, digging the turf and clay, shoving his loads up  the slope and out upon the edge of the ditch. The process was all in  clear, easy view of the watchers, their place of hiding being not more  than eight or ten paces distant.    They had grown altogether absorbed in watching the little canal-builder,  when a cracking sound made them turn their eyes. The tree was toppling  slowly. Every beaver now made a mad rush for the canal, not caring  how much noise he made--and plunged into the water. Slowly,  reluctantly, majestically, the tall birch swung forward straight down  the slope, its top describing a great arc against the sky and  gathering the air in its branches with a low but terrifying roar. The  final crash was unexpectedly gentle,--or rather, would have seemed so  to one unfamiliar with tree-felling. Some branches snapped, some  sticks flew up and dropped, there was a shuddering confusion in the  crystal air for a few seconds, then the stillness fell once more.    But now there was not a beaver to be seen. Jabe wondered if they had  been scared by the results of their own work; or if one of their  sentinels had come and peered into the thicket from the rear. As  minute after minute dragged by, and nothing happened, he began to  realize that his muscles were aching savagely from their long  restraint. He was on the point of moving, of whispering to ask the Boy  what it meant, when the latter, divining his unrest, stealthily laid a  restraining hand upon his arm. He guessed that the beavers were on the  alert, hiding, and watching to see if any of their enemies should be  attracted by the noise.    [Illustration: \"EVERY BEAVER NOW MADE A MAD RUSH FOR THE CANAL.\"]    Not five seconds later, however, he forgot his aches. Appearing with  uncanny and inexplicable suddenness, there was the big pioneer again,  sitting up by the edge of the canal. As before, he sat absolutely  motionless for a minute or two, sniffing and listening. Then,  satisfied once more that all was well, he moved lazily up the slope to  examine the tree; and in half a minute all were at work again, except  that there was no more tree-felling. The great business of the hour  was cutting brush.    For some time longer the watchers lay motionless, noting every detail  of the work, till at last the Boy began to think it was time to  release Jabe from his long and severe restraint and break up the  beaver \"chopping-bee.\" Before he had quite made up his mind, however,  his eyes chanced to wander a little way up the slope, and to rest,  without any conscious purpose, on a short gray bit of log. Presently  he began to wonder what a piece of log so short and thick--not much  more than three feet long--would be doing there. No beavers would  waste time cutting up a twelve-inch log into lengths like that. And  there had been no lumberman in the neighbourhood. Then, in a flash,  his eyes cleared themselves of their illusion. The log had moved, ever  so slightly. It was no longer a log, but a big gray lynx, creeping  slowly, inexorably, down upon the unsuspecting people of the pond.    For perhaps ten seconds the Boy stared in uncertainty. Then he saw the  lynx gather his muscles for the final, fatal rush. Without a whisper  or a warning to the astonished Jabe, he whipped up his rifle, and  fired.    The sharp report seemed to shatter the whole scene. Its echoes were  mixed with the scattering of the horrified beavers as they rushed for  the water--with the short screech of the lynx, as it bounced into the  air and fell back on its side, dead--with an exclamation of  astonishment from Jabe--and with a crashing of branches just behind  the thicket. The Boy looked around, triumphant--to see that Jabe's  exclamation was not at all the result of his clever shot. The woodsman  was on his hands and knees, his back turned, and staring at the form  of a big black bear as it lumbered off in a panic through the bushes.  Like the unfortunate lynx, the bear had been stalking the beavers on  his own account, and had almost stepped upon the silent watchers in  the thicket.    [Illustration: \"IT WAS NO LONGER A LOG, BUT A BIG GRAY LYNX.\"]          CHAPTER V    Dam Repairing and Dam Building      AS the Boy trudged triumphantly back toward camp, over the crest of  the moon-bright ridge, he carried the limp, furry body of the lynx  slung by its hind legs over his shoulder. He felt that his prestige  had gone up incalculably in the woodsman's eyes. The woodsman was  silent, however, as silent as the wilderness, till they descended the  other slope and came in sight of the little solitary camp. Then he  said: \"That was a mighty slick shot of yourn, d'ye know it? Ye're  quicker'n chain lightnin', an' dead on!\"    \"Just luck, Jabe!\" replied the Boy carelessly, trying to seem properly  modest.    This different suggestion Jabe did not take the trouble to controvert.  He knew the Boy did not mean it.    \"But I thought as how ye wouldn't kill anything?\" he went on,  teasingly.    \"Had to!\" retorted the Boy. \"That was self-defence! Those beavers are  my beavers. An' I've always wanted a real good excuse for getting a  good lynx skin, anyway!\"    \"I don't blame ye a mite fer standin' by them beaver!\" continued Jabe.  \"They're jest all right! It was better'n any circus; an' I don't know  when I've enjoyed myself more.\"    \"Then the least you can do, Jabe, is promise not to trap any more  beavers!\" said the Boy quickly.    \"Wa'al,\" answered Jabe, as they entered camp and began spreading their  blankets, \"leastwise I'll do my best to see that no harm comes to them  beaver, nor to the pond.\"    Next morning, as the woodsman was starting out for the day's cruise,  the Boy said to him:    \"If you're game for another night's watching, Jabe, I'll show you  something altogether different up at the pond to-night.\"    \"Try me!\" responded the woodsman.    \"You'll have to be back earlier than usual, then,\" said the Boy.  \"We'll have to get hidden earlier, and in a new place.\"    \"I'll come back along a couple of hours afore sundown, then,\" answered  Jabe, swinging off on his long, mooselike stride. It was contrary to  his backwoods etiquette to ask what was in store for him; but his  curiosity was excited, and kept him company through the solitude all  day.    When Jabe was gone, the Boy went straight up-stream to the dam, taking  no special care to hide his coming. His plan was one in regard to  which he felt some guilty qualms. But he consoled himself with the  thought that whatever harm he might be doing to the little citizens of  the pond would be more than compensated by the protection he was  giving them. He was going to make a break in the dam, for the sake of  seeing just how the beavers would mend it.    On reaching the dam, however, it occurred to him that if he made the  break now the beavers might regard the matter as too urgent to be left  till nightfall. They might steal a march on him by mending the damage  little by little, surreptitiously, through the day. He had no way of  knowing just how they would take so serious a danger as a break in  their dam. He decided, therefore, to postpone his purpose till the  afternoon, so that the beavers would not come to the rescue too early.  In the meantime, he would explore the stream above the pond, and see  if there were other communities to study.    Skirting the hither side of the pond to near its head, he crossed the  little meadow and the canal, and reached the brook again about fifty  yards beyond. Here he found it flowing swift and narrow, over a rocky  bottom, between high banks; and this was its character for nearly half  a mile, as he judged. Then, emerging once more upon lower ground, he  came upon a small dam. This structure was not much over eighteen  inches in height, and the pond above it, small and shallow, showed no  signs of being occupied. There was no beaver house to be seen, either  in the water or on shore; and the water did not seem to be anywhere  more than a foot and a half in depth. As he puzzled over this--for he  did not think the beavers were likely to build a dam for nothing--he  observed a second and much larger dam far away across the head of the  pond.    Hastening to investigate this upper dam, he found it fully three feet  high, and very massive. Above it was a narrow but deep pond, between  comparatively steep shores; and along these shores he counted three  low-roofed houses. Out in the middle of the pond there was not one  dwelling; and he came presently to the conclusion that here, between  the narrow banks, the current would be heavy in time of freshet. The  lower dam, pretty obviously, was intended to reinforce the upper, by  backing a foot and a half of water against it and taking off just that  much of the pressure. He decided that the reason for locating the  three houses along the shore was that the steep bank afforded special  facilities for shore burrows.    The explorer's fever being now hot upon him, the Boy could not stay to  examine this pond minutely. He pressed on up-stream with breathless  eagerness, thrilling with expectation of what the next turn might  reveal. As a matter of fact, the next turn revealed nothing--nor the  next, nor yet the next. But as the stream was full of turns in this  portion of its course, that was not greatly discouraging.    About a quarter of a mile, however, above the head of the narrow pond,  the ardent explorer came upon a level of sparse alder swamp. Here he  found the stream just beginning to spread over its low banks. The  cause of this spreading was a partial obstruction in mid-channel--what  looked, at first glance, like an accidental accumulation of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995"],[0,"Tacitus on Germany (#6)"],[1," to the  ocean; a community now very small, but great in fame. Nay, of their  ancient renown, many and extensive are the traces and monuments still  remaining; even their entrenchments upon either shore, so vast in  compass that from thence you may even now measure the greatness and  numerous bands of that people, and assent to the account of an army so  mighty. It was on the six hundred and fortieth year of Rome, when of the  arms of the Cimbrians the first mention was made, during the Consulship  of Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo. If from that time we count to  the second Consulship of the Emperor Trajan, the interval comprehends  near two hundred and ten years; so long have we been conquering Germany.  In a course of time, so vast between these two periods, many have been  the blows and disasters suffered on each side. In truth neither from the  Samnites, nor from the Carthaginians, nor from both Spains, nor from all  the nations of Gaul, have we received more frequent checks and alarms;  nor even from the Parthians: for, more vigorous and invincible is the  liberty of the Germans than the monarchy of the Arsacides. Indeed, what  has the power of the East to allege to our dishonour; but the fall of  Crassus, that power which was itself overthrown and abased by Ventidius,  with the loss of the great King Pacorus bereft of his life? But by the  Germans the Roman People have been bereft of five armies, all commanded  by Consuls; by the Germans, the commanders of these armies, Carbo, and  Cassius, and Scaurus Aurelius, and Servilius Caepio, as also Marcus  Manlius, were all routed or taken: by the Germans even the Emperor  Augustus was bereft of Varus and three legions. Nor without difficulty  and loss of men were they defeated by Caius Marius in Italy, or by the  deified Julius in Gaul, or by Drusus or Tiberius or Germanicus in their  native territories. Soon after, the mighty menaces of Caligula against  them ended in mockery and derision. Thenceforward they continued quiet,  till taking advantage of our domestic division and civil wars, they  stormed and seized the winter entrenchments of the legions, and aimed at  the dominion of Gaul; from whence they were once more expulsed, and in  the times preceding the present, we gained a triumph over them rather  than a victory.    I must now proceed to speak of the Suevians, who are not, like the  Cattans and Tencterians, comprehended in a single people; but divided  into several nations all bearing distinct names, though in general they  are entitled Suevians, and occupy the larger share of Germany. This  people are remarkable for a peculiar custom, that of twisting their hair  and binding it up in a knot. It is thus the Suevians are distinguished  from the other Germans, thus the free Suevians from their slaves. In  other nations, whether from alliance of blood with the Suevians, or, as  is usual from imitation, this practice is also found, yet rarely, and  never exceeds the years of youth. The Suevians, even when their hair is  white through age, continue to raise it backwards in a manner stern and  staring; and often tie it upon the top of their head only. That of their  Princes, is more accurately disposed, and so far they study to appear  agreeable and comely; but without any culpable intention. For by  it, they mean not to make love or to incite it: they thus dress when  proceeding to war, and deck their heads so as to add to their height and  terror in the eyes of the enemy.    Of all the Suevians, the Semnones recount themselves to be the most  ancient and most noble. The belief of their antiquity is confirmed  by religious mysteries. At a stated time of the year, all the several  people descended from the same stock, assemble by their deputies in  a wood; consecrated by the idolatries of their forefathers, and by  superstitious awe in times of old. There by publicly sacrificing a man,  they begin the horrible solemnity of their barbarous worship. To this  grove another sort of reverence is also paid. No one enters it otherwise  than bound with ligatures, thence professing his subordination and  meanness, and power of the Deity there. If he fall down, he is not  permitted to rise or be raised, but grovels along upon the ground. And  of all their superstition, this is the drift and tendency; that from  this place the nation drew their original, that here God, the supreme  Governor of the world, resides, and that all things else whatsoever  are subject to him and bound to obey him. The potent condition of the  Semnones has increased their influence and authority, as they inhabit an  hundred towns; and from the largeness of their community it comes, that  they hold themselves for the head of the Suevians.    What on the contrary ennobles the Langobards is the smallness of their  number, for that they, who are surrounded with very many and very  powerful nations, derive their security from no obsequiousness or  plying; but from the dint of battle and adventurous deeds. There follow  in order the Reudignians, and Aviones, and Angles, and Varinians, and  Eudoses, and Suardones and Nuithones; all defended by rivers or forests.  Nor in one of these nations does aught remarkable occur, only that they  universally join in the worship of _Herthum_; that is to say, the Mother  Earth. Her they believe to interpose in the affairs of men, and to visit  countries. In an island of the ocean stands the wood _Castum_: in it  is a chariot dedicated to the Goddess covered over with a curtain, and  permitted to be touched by none but the Priest. Whenever the Goddess  enters this her holy vehicle, he perceives her; and with profound  veneration attends the motion of the chariot, which is always drawn by  yoked cows. Then it is that days of rejoicing always ensue, and in all  places whatsoever which she descends to honour with a visit and her  company, feasts and recreation abound. They go not to war; they touch  no arms; fast laid up is every hostile weapon; peace and repose are  then only known, then only beloved, till to the temple the same priest  reconducts the Goddess when well tired with the conversation of mortal  beings. Anon the chariot is washed and purified in a secret lake, as  also the curtain; nay, the Deity herself too, if you choose to believe  it. In this office it is slaves who minister, and they are forthwith  doomed to be swallowed up in the same lake. Hence all men are possessed  with mysterious terror; as well as with a holy ignorance what that must  be, which none see but such as are immediately to perish. Moreover this  quarter of the Suevians stretches to the middle of Germany.    The community next adjoining, is that of the Hermondurians; (that I may  now follow the course of the Danube, as a little before I did that of  the Rhine) a people this, faithful to the Romans. So that to them alone  of all the Germans, commerce is permitted; not barely upon the bank of  the Rhine, but more extensively, and even in that glorious colony in the  province of Rhoetia. They travel everywhere at their own discretion and  without a guard; and when to other nations, we show no more than our  arms and encampments, to this people we throw open our houses and  dwellings, as to men who have no longing to possess them. In the  territories of the Hermondurians rises the Elbe, a river very famous and  formerly well known to us; at present we only hear it named.    Close by the Hermondurians reside the Nariscans, and next to them the  Marcomanians and Quadians. Amongst these the Marcomanians are most  signal in force and renown; nay, their habitation itself they acquired  by their bravery, as from thence they formerly expulsed the Boians. Nor  do the Nariscans or Quadians degenerate in spirit. Now this is as it  were the frontier of Germany, as far as Germany is washed by the Danube.  To the times within our memory the Marcomanians and Quadians were  governed by kings, who were natives of their own, descended from the  noble line of Maroboduus and Tudrus. At present they are even subject to  such as are foreigners. But the whole strength and sway of their king  is derived from the authority of the Romans. From our arms, they rarely  receive any aid; from our money very frequently.    Nor less powerful are the several people beyond them; namely, the  Marsignians, the Gothinians, the Osians and the Burians, who altogether  enclose the Marcomanians and Quadians behind. Of those, the Marsignians  and the Burians in speech and dress resemble the Suevians. From the  Gallic language spoken by the Gothinians, and from that of Pannonia by  the Osians, it is manifest that neither of these people are Germans; as  it is also from their bearing to pay tribute. Upon them as upon aliens  their tribute is imposed, partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the  Quadians. The Gothinians, to heighten their disgrace, are forced to  labour in the iron mines. By all these several nations but little level  country is possessed: they are seated amongst forests, and upon  the ridges and declivities of mountains. For, Suevia is parted by a  continual ridge of mountains; beyond which, live many distinct nations.  Of these the Lygians are most numerous and extensive, and spread into  several communities. It will suffice to mention the most puissant; even  the Arians, Helvicones, Manimians; Elysians and Naharvalians. Amongst  the Naharvalians is shown a grove, sacred to devotion extremely ancient.  Over it a Priest presides apparelled like a woman; but according to  the explication of the Romans, 'tis _Castor_ and _Pollux_ who are here  worshipped. This Divinity is named _Alcis_. There are indeed no images  here, no traces of an extraneous superstition; yet their devotion is  addressed to young men and to brothers. Now the Arians, besides their  forces, in which they surpass the several nations just recounted, are  in their persons stern and truculent; and even humour and improve their  natural"]]]
