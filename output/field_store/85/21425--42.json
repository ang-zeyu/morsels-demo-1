But--    Mr. Yardo comes to life at the sound of his name and his grin widens  alarmingly.    \"Especially meat,\" he says.           *       *       *       *       *    It is maybe two hours afterwards, Eru having adjourned the meeting  abruptly so that we can ... er ... take in the implications of the new  data. Lennie has gone off somewhere by himself; Kirsty has gone after  him with a view to Mothering him; Eru, I suspect, is looking for  Kirsty; Pavel and Aro and Dillie and the Crow are in a cabin arguing  in whispers; Nick and P. Zapotec are exploring one of the Hoppers,  cargo-carrying, drop-shaped, and I only hope they don't hop through  the hull in it.    B and I having done a tour of the ship and ascertained all this have  withdrawn to the Conference Room because we are tired of our cabins  and this seems to be the only other place to sit.    B breaks a long silence with the remark that However often you see it  M'Clare's technique is something to watch, like choosing my statement  to open with, it broke the ice beautifully.    I say, \"Shall I tell you something?\"    B says Yes if it's interesting.    \"My statement,\" I inform her, \"ran something like this: The best hope  of inducing a suspension of the aggressive attitude of both parties,  long enough to offer hope of ultimate reconciliation, lies in the  intrusion of a new factor in the shape of an outside force seen to be  impartially hostile to both.\"    B says: \"Gosh. Come to think of it Liz you have not written like that  in years, you have gone all pompous like everyone else; well that  makes it even _more_ clever of M'Clare.\"    Enter Cray Patterson and drapes himself sideways on a chair,  announcing that his own thoughts begin to weary him.    I say this does not surprise me, at all.    \"Lizzie my love,\" says he, \"you are twice blessed being not only witty  yourself but a cause of wit in others; was that bit of Primitive Lee  with which M'Clare regaled us really not from the hand of the  mistress, or was it a mere pastiche?\"    I say Whoever wrote that it was not me anyway.    \"It seemed to me pale and luke-warm compared with the real thing,\"  says Cray languidly, \"which brings me to a point that, to quote dear  Kirsty, seems to have been missed.\"    I say, \"Yep. Like what language it was that these people wrote their  log in that we can be _certain_ the Incognitans won't know.\"    \"More than that,\" says B, \"we didn't decide who they are or where they  were coming from or how they came to crash or anything.\"    \"Come to think of it, though,\" I point out, \"the language and a good  many other things must have been decided already because of getting  the right hypnotapes and translators on board.\"    B suddenly lights up.    \"Yes, but look, I bet that's what we're here for, I mean that's why  they picked us instead of Space Department people--the ship's got to  have a past history, it has to come from a planet somewhere only no  one must ever find out _where_ it's supposed to be. Someone will have  to fake a log, only I don't see how--\"    \"The first reel with data showing the planet of origin got damaged  during the crash,\" says Cray impatiently.    \"Yes, of course--but we have to find a reason why they were in that  part of Space and it has to be a _nice_ one, I mean so that the  Incognitans when they finally read the log won't hate them any more--\"    \"Maybe they were bravely defending their own planet by hunting down an  interplanetary raider,\" I suggest.    Cray says it will take only the briefest contact with other planets to  convince the Incognitans that interplanetary raiders can't and don't  exist, modern planetary alarm and defense systems put them out of the  question.    \"That's all he knows,\" says B, \"some interplanetary pirates raided  Lizzie's father's farm once. Didn't they, Liz?\"    \"Yes in a manner of speaking, but they were bums who pinched a  spaceship from a planet not many parsecs away, a sparsely inhabited  mining world like my own which had no real call for an alarm system,  so that hardly alters the argument.\"    \"Well,\" says B, \"the alarm system on Incognita can't be so hot or the  observation ships could not have got in, or out, for that matter,  unless of course they have some other gadget we don't know about.\"    \"On the other hand,\" she considers, \"to mention Interplanetary raiders  raises the idea of Menace in an Unfriendly Universe again, and this is  what we want to cancel out.    \"These people,\" she says at last with a visionary look in her eye,  \"come from a planet which went isolationist and abandoned space  travel; now they have built up their civilization to a point where  they can build ships of their own again, and the ones on Gilgamesh  have cut loose from the ideas of their ancestors that led to their  going so far afield--\"    \"How far afield?\" says Cray.    \"No one will ever know,\" I point out to him. \"Don't interrupt.\"    \"Anyway,\" says B, \"they set out to rejoin the rest of the Human Race  just like the people on _Gilgamesh_ _really_ did, in fact, a lot of  this is the truth only kind of backwards--they were looking for the  Cradle of the Race, that's what. Then there was some sort of disaster  that threw them off course to land on an uninhabited section of a  planet that couldn't understand their signals. And when Incognita  finally does take to space flight again I bet the first thing the  people do is to try and follow back to where _Gilgamesh_ came from and  make contact with them. It'll become a legend on Incognita--the Lost  People ... the Lost ... Lost--\"    \"The Lost Kafoozalum,\" says Cray. \"In other words we switch these  people off a war only to send them on a wild goose chase.\"    At which a strange voice chimes in, \"No, no, no, son, you've got it  all _wrong_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Yardo is with us like a well-meaning skeleton.    During the next twenty-five minutes we learn a lot about Mr. Yardo  including material for a good guess at how he came to be picked for  this expedition; doubtless there are many experts on Reversal Of  Vacuum-Induced Changes in Organic Tissues but maybe only one of them a  Romantic at heart.    Mr. Yardo thinks chasing the Wild Goose will do the Incognitans all  the good in the galaxy, it will take their minds off controversies  over interhemispherical trade and put them on to the quest of the  Unobtainable; they will get to know something of the Universe outside  their own little speck. Mr. Yardo has seen a good deal of the Universe  in the course of advising on how to recondition space-packed meat and  he found it an Uplifting Experience.    We gather he finds this desperate bit of damfoolery we are on now  pretty Uplifting altogether.    Cray keeps surprisingly quiet but it is as well that the rest of the  party start to trickle in about twenty minutes later the first  arrivals remarking Oh _that's_ where you've got to!    Presently we are all congregated at one end of the table as before,  except that Mr. Yardo is now sitting between B and me; when M'Clare  and the colonel come in he firmly stays where he is evidently  considering himself One of Us now.    \"The proposition,\" says M'Clare, \"is that we intend to take  _Gilgamesh_ to Incognita and land her there in such a way as to  suggest that she crashed. In the absence of evidence to the contrary  the Incognitans are bound to assume that that was her intended  destination, and the presence of weapons, even disarmed, will suggest  that her mission was aggressive. Firstly, can anyone suggest a better  course of action? or does anyone object to this one?\"    We all look at Lennie who sticks his hands in his pockets and mutters  \"No.\"    Kirsty gives her little cough and says there is a point which has not  been mentioned.    If a heavily-armed ship crashes on Incognita, will not the government  of the hemisphere in which it crashes be presented with new ideas for  offensive weapons? And won't this make it _more_ likely that they will  start aggression? And won't the fear of this make the other hemisphere  even more likely to try and get in first before the new weapons are  complete?    Hell, I ought to have thought of that.    From the glance of unwilling respect which the colonel bestows on  M'Clare it is plain these points have been dealt with.    \"The weapons on Gilgamesh were disarmed when she was rediscovered,\" he  says. \"Essential sections were removed. The Incognitans won't be able  to reconstruct how they worked.\"    _Another_ fact for which we shall have to provide an explanation. Well  how about this: The early explorers sent out by these people--the  people in Gilgamesh ... oh, use Cray's word and call them Lost  Kafoozalum anyway their ships were armed, but they never found any  enemies and the Idealists of B's story refused even to carry arms any  more.    (Which is just about what happened when the Terries set out to  rediscover the colonies, after all.)    So the Lost Kafoozalum could not get rid of their weapons completely  because it would have meant rebuilding the ship; so they just  partially dismantled them.    Mr. Yardo suddenly chips in, \"About that other point, girlie, surely  there must be some neutral ground left on a half-occupied planet like  that?\" He beams round, pleased at being able to contribute.    B says, \"The thing is,\" and stops.    We wait.    We have about given up hope when she resumes, \"The thing is, it will  have to be neutral ground of course, only that might easily become a  thingummy ... I mean a, a _casus belli_ in itself. So the _other_  thing is it ought to be a place which is very hard to get at, so  difficult that neither side can really get to it first, they'll have  to reach an agreement and co-operate.\"    \"Yeah,\" says Dillie \"that sounds fine, but what sort of place is  that?\"    I am sorting out in my head the relative merits of mountains,  deserts, gorges, et cetera, when I an seized with inspiration at the  same time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3043"],[0,"The Quaker Colonies: A Chronicle of the Proprietors of the Delaware (#6)"],[1,"  the surrounding region, which was then a wilderness. They and all the  other Germans who afterwards followed them settled in a half circle  beginning at Easton on the Delaware, passing up the Lehigh Valley into  Lancaster County, thence across the Susquehanna and down the Cumberland  Valley to the Maryland border, which many of them crossed, and in time  scattered far to the south in Virginia and even North Carolina, where  their descendants are still found.    These German sects which came over under the influence of Penn and the  Quakers, between the years 1682 and 1702, formed a class by themselves.  Though they may be regarded as peculiar in their ideas and often in  their manner of life, it cannot be denied that as a class they were a  well-educated, thrifty, and excellent people and far superior to the  rough German peasants who followed them in later years. This latter  class was often spoken of in Pennsylvania as \"the church people,\" to  distinguish them from \"the sects,\" as those of the earlier migration  were called.    The church people, or peasantry of the later migration, belonged usually  to one of the two dominant churches of Germany, the Lutheran or  the Reformed. Those of the Reformed Church were often spoken of as  Calvinists. This migration of the church people was not due to the  example of the Quakers but was the result of a new policy which was  adopted by the British Government when Queen Anne ascended the throne  in 1702, and which aimed at keeping the English people at home and at  filling the English colonies in America with foreign Protestants hostile  to France and Spain.    Large numbers of these immigrants were \"redemptioners,\" as they were  called; that is to say, they were persons who had been obliged to sell  themselves to the shipping agents to pay for their passage. On their  arrival in Pennsylvania the captain sold them to the colonists to pay  the passage, and the redemptioner had to work for his owner for a period  varying from five to ten years. No stigma or disgrace clung to any of  these people under this system. It was regarded as a necessary business  transaction. Not a few of the very respectable families of the State and  some of its prominent men are known to be descended from redemptioners.    This method of transporting colonists proved a profitable trade for  the shipping people, and was soon regularly organized like the modern  assisted immigration. Agents, called \"newlanders\" and \"soul-sellers,\"  traveled through Germany working up the transatlantic traffic by various  devices, some of them not altogether creditable. Pennsylvania proved to  be the most attractive region for these immigrants. Some of those who  were taken to other colonies finally worked their way to Pennsylvania.  Practically none went to New England, and very few, if any, to Virginia.  Indeed, only certain colonies were willing to admit them.    Another important element that went to make up the Pennsylvania  population consisted of the Scotch-Irish. They were descendants of  Scotch and English Presbyterians who had gone to Ireland to take up the  estates of the Irish rebels confiscated under Queen Elizabeth and James  I. This migration of Protestants to Ireland, which began soon after  1600, was encouraged by the English Government. Towards the middle  of the seventeenth century the confiscation of more Irish land under  Cromwell's regime increased the migration to Ulster. Many English joined  the migration, and Scotch of the Lowlands who were largely of English  extraction, although there were many Gaelic or Celtic names among them.    These are the people usually known in English history as Ulstermen--the  same who made such a heroic defense of Londonderry against James II, and  the same who in modern times have resisted home rule in Ireland because  it would bury them, they believe, under the tyranny of their old  enemies, the native Irish Catholic majority. They were more thrifty and  industrious than the native Irish and as a result they usually prospered  on the Irish land. At first they were in a more or less constant state  of war with the native Irish, who attempted to expel them. They were  subsequently persecuted by the Church of England under Charles I, who  attempted to force them to conform to the English established religion.  Such a rugged schooling in Ireland made of them a very aggressive, hardy  people, Protestants of the Protestants, so accustomed to contests and  warfare that they accepted it as the natural state of man.    These Ulstermen came to Pennsylvania somewhat later than the first  German sects; and not many of them arrived until some years after 1700.  They were not, like the first Germans, attracted to the colony by any  resemblance of their religion to that of the Quakers. On the contrary  they were entirely out of sympathy with the Quakers, except in the  one point of religious liberty; and the Quakers were certainly out of  sympathy with them. Nearly all the colonies in America received a share  of these settlers. Wherever they went they usually sought the frontier  and the wilderness; and by the time of the Revolution, they could be  found upon the whole colonial frontier from New Hampshire to Georgia.  They were quite numerous in Virginia, and most numerous along the edge  of the Pennsylvania wilderness. It was apparently the liberal laws  and the fertile soil that drew them to Pennsylvania in spite of their  contempt for most of the Quaker doctrines.    The dream of their life, their haven of rest, was for these Scotch-Irish  a fertile soil where they would find neither Irish \"papists\" nor Church  of England; and for this reason in America they always sought the  frontier where they could be by themselves. They could not even get on  well with the Germans in Pennsylvania; and when the Germans crowded  into their frontier settlements, quarrels became so frequent that the  proprietors asked the Ulstermen to move farther west, a suggestion which  they were usually quite willing to accept. At the close of the colonial  period in Pennsylvania the Quakers, the Church of England people, and  the miscellaneous denominations occupied Philadelphia and the region  round it in a half circle from the Delaware River. Outside of this  area lay another containing the Germans, and beyond that were the  Scotch-Irish. The principal stronghold of the Scotch-Irish was the  Cumberland Valley in Southern Pennsylvania west of the Susquehanna, a  region now containing the flourishing towns of Chambersburg, Gettysburg,  Carlisle, and York, where the descendants of these early settlers are  still very numerous. In modern times, however, they have spread out  widely; they are now to be found all over the State, and they no longer  desire so strongly to live by themselves.    The Ulstermen, owing to the circumstances of their earlier life, had no  sympathy whatever with the Quaker's objection to war or with his  desire to deal fairly with the Indians and pay them for their land. As  Presbyterians and Calvinists, they belonged to one of the older and more  conservative divisions of the Reformation. The Quaker's doctrine of the  inward light, his quietism, contemplation, and advanced ideas were quite  incomprehensible to them. As for the Indians, they held that the Old  Testament commands the destruction of all the heathen; and as for paying  the savages for their land, it seemed ridiculous to waste money on such  an object when they could exterminate the natives at less cost. The  Ulstermen, therefore, settled on the Indian land as they pleased, or for  that matter on any land, and were continually getting into difficulty  with the Pennsylvania Government no less than with the Indians. They  regarded any region into which they entered as constituting a sovereign  state. It was this feeling of independence which subsequently prompted  them to organize what is known as the Whisky Rebellion when, after the  Revolution, the Federal Government put a tax on the liquor which they  so much esteemed as a product, for corn converted into whisky was more  easily transported on horses over mountain trails, and in that form  fetched a better price in the markets.    After the year 1755, when the Quaker method of dealing with the Indians  no longer prevailed, the Scotch-Irish lived on the frontier in a  continual state of savage warfare which lasted for the next forty years.  War, hunting the abundant game, the deer, buffalo, and elk, and some  agriculture filled the measure of their days and years. They paid little  attention to the laws of the province, which were difficult to enforce  on the distant frontier, and they administered a criminal code of their  own with whipping or \"laced jacket,\" as they called it, as a punishment.  They were Jacks of all trades, weaving their own cloth and making nearly  everything they needed. They were the first people in America to develop  the use of the rifle, and they used it in the Back Country all the  way down into the Carolinas at a time when it was seldom seen in the  seaboard settlements. In those days, rifles were largely manufactured  in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and there were several famous gunsmiths in  Philadelphia. Some of the best of these old rifles have been preserved  and are really beautiful weapons, with delicate hair triggers,  gracefully curved stocks, and quaint brass or even gold or silver  mountings. The ornamentation was often done by the hunter himself, who  would melt a gold or silver coin and pour it into some design which he  had carved with his knife in the stock.    The Revolution offered an opportunity after the Ulstermen's heart,  and they entered it with their entire spirit, as they had every other  contest which involved liberty and independence. In fact, in that period  they played such a conspicuous part that they almost ruled Philadelphia,  the original home of the Quakers. Since then, spread out through the  State,"]]]
