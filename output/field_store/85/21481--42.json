Among the hundreds of others recorded,  none was found more than twice in any one place.    Despite the fact that field work was concentrated on small areas which  were worked intensively, only eight per cent of the frogs recorded were  ever recaptured, and most of those were recaptured only once. Only 13  individuals yielded series of records, well spaced, in two or more  different years. These few individuals recaptured frequently may not be  typical of the entire population. The low incidence of recaptures  indicates that relatively few of the frogs present on an area at any one  time have been taken. Because of their secretive and subterranean habits  most of the frogs are missed by a collector who searches by turning  rocks, or trapping with pitfalls. Therefore, even though a marked frog  may survive and remain within a radius of a few hundred feet of one  point for months or even years, the chances of recapture are poor.    One female was caught first as a juvenile on June 8, 1950. On April 24,  1951, when first recaptured, she had grown to small adult size, and was  only 18 feet from the original location. On July 30, 1951, however, she  was recaptured 750 feet away. At a fourth capture on May 21, 1952, she  had shifted 70 feet farther in the same direction. At the final capture  on June 24, 1952, she was approximately 140 feet from both the third and  fourth locations. The sequence of these records suggests that the frog  had already settled in a home range at the time of her first capture in  1950, and that approximately a year later she shifted to a second home  range, which was occupied for the following year, at least.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Distances between captures in frogs marked, and  recaptured after substantial intervals including one or more  hibernations. Distances are grouped in 25-foot intervals. For longer  distances the trend is toward progressively fewer records, indicating  that typical home ranges are small.]    In several instances, after recaptures as far as 400 feet from the  original location, frogs were again captured near an original location,  suggesting that for some individuals, at least, home ranges may be as  much as 400 feet in diameter.    Figure 8 shows that for movements of up to 400 feet, numbers of  individuals gradually decrease with greater distance. For distances of  more than 400 feet there are comparatively few records. Of the 59  individuals recaptured after one or more hibernations, only nine had  moved more than 400 feet from the original location. Twenty-five were  recaptured at distances of 75 feet or less. The mean distance for  movement for all individuals recaptured was 72 feet. A typical home  range, therefore, seems to average no more than 75 feet in radius. Of  the 59 individuals recaptured after one or more hibernations, 47 were  adults and probably many of these had made round-trip migrations to the  breeding pond. This was not actually demonstrated for any one  individual, but several were captured in each of three or four different  years near the same location.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. Distances between captures and elapsed time in  months in marked frogs recaptured. Few records are for distances more  than 400 feet. There is but little tendency to longer movements in those  caught after relatively long intervals.]    The trend of movements differed in the sexes. Males are more vagile. Of  21 adult males recaptured, none was less than 40 feet from its original  location, whereas six of the 26 adult females were less than 40 feet  away from the original point of capture. Of seven frogs that had  wandered 700 feet or more, five were males.      FOOD HABITS    According to Smith (1934: 503) stomachs of many specimens, from widely  scattered localities in Kansas, contained only large numbers of small  ants. Tanner (1950: 47) described the situation of a frog found on the  Reservation buried in loose soil beneath a flat rock, beside an ant  burrow, where, presumably, the frog could snap up the passing ants  without shifting its position. Anderson (_op. cit._: 21) examined  alimentary tracts of 203 specimens of _carolinensis_ from Louisiana,  representing a year round sample for several different habitats. He  found a variety of small animals including ants, termites, beetles,  springtails, bugs, ear-wigs, lepidopterans, spiders, mites, centipedes,  and snails. Most of these prey animals were represented by few  individuals, and ants were much more numerous than any of the other  groups. Anderson concluded that ants, termites, and small beetles were  the principal foods. He noted that some of the beetles were of groups  commonly found in ant colonies. Tanner reported that in a large number  of the frogs which he collected in Douglas, Riley, Pottawatomie, and  Geary counties, Kansas, the digestive tracts and feces contained only  ants. Wood (1948: 226) reported an individual of _G. carolinensis_ in  Tennessee found under a flat rock in the center of an ant nest.    Freiburg (_op. cit._: 383) reported on the stomach contents of 52  ant-eating frogs collected near the Reservation. Ants constituted nearly  all these stomach contents, though remains of a few small beetles were  found. The ants eaten were of two kinds, _Lasius interjectus_ and  _Crematogaster_ sp. The latter was by far the more numerous.    Although I made no further study of stomach contents, the myrmecophagous  habits of _Gastrophryne_ have come to my attention frequently in the  course of routine field work. Individuals kept in confinement for a day  or more almost invariably voided feces which consisted mainly or  entirely of ant remains, chiefly the heads, as these are most resistant  to digestion.    Often upon examining frogs I have found ants (_Crematogaster_ sp.) or  their severed heads, attached with mandibles embedded in the skin. To  have been attacked by ants, the frogs must have been in or beside the  ants' burrow systems. Frequently the frogs that were uncovered beneath  rocks were adjacent to clusters of ants or to their nests or travelways,  in a position strategically located to feed upon them, as described by  Tanner. Often the feces of the frogs were found in pitfalls or under  flat rocks. Although these feces were not analyzed, they seemed to  consist mainly or entirely of ant remains.    The species of _Crematogaster_, which is the chief food of  _Gastrophryne_ in this region, is largely subterranean in habits, and is  extremely abundant. Any flat rock in damp soil is likely to harbor a  colony beneath it. Colonies are situated also in damp soil away from  rocks, beneath almost any kind of debris, and in hollow weed stalks and  decaying wood. Live-traps for small mammals, having nest boxes attached,  almost always were occupied by colonies of _Crematogaster_, if they were  left in the field in warm, humid weather. Occasionally the ants attacked  and killed small mammals caught in such traps. Among the thousands of  kinds of insects occurring on the Reservation, this ant is one of the  most numerous in individuals, one of the most important on the basis of  biomass and provides an abundant food source for those predators that  are ant eaters. Food supply probably is not a limiting factor to  populations of _Gastrophryne_ on the area.      PREDATION    Young copperheads are known to feed upon ant-eating frogs occasionally  (Anderson, 1942: 216; Freiburg, 1951: 378). Other kinds of snakes  supposedly eat them also. The common water snake (_Natrix sipedon_) and  garter snake (_Thamnophis sirtalis_) probably take heavy toll of the  adults at the time they are concentrated at the breeding pools. Larger  salientians may be among the more important enemies of the breeding  adults, the tadpoles, and the newly metamorphosed young. Bullfrogs  (_Rana catesbeiana_) and leopard frogs (_Rana pipiens_) are normally  abundant at the pond on the Reservation. These large voracious frogs  lining the banks are quick to lunge at any moving object, and must take  heavy toll of the much smaller ant-eating frogs that have to pass  through their ranks to reach the water. The newly metamorphosed young  often are forced to remain at a pond's edge for many days, or even for  weeks, by drought and they must be subject to especially heavy predation  by ranid frogs. Even the smallest newly metamorphosed bullfrogs and  leopard frogs would be large enough to catch and eat them.    As a result of persistent drought conditions in 1952 and 1953, bullfrogs  were completely eliminated from the pond by early 1954. Re-invasion by a  few individuals occurred in the course of the summer; these probably  made long overland trips from ponds or streams that had persisted  through the drought. Leopard frogs reached the pond in somewhat larger  numbers, but their population in 1954 was only a small percentage of  that present in most other years. Notable success in the ant-eating  frog's reproduction in 1954 may have been due largely to the scarcity of  these large ranids at the breeding ponds.    Freiburg (_loc. cit._) noted that many of the ant-eating frogs he  examined were scarred, and some had digits or limbs amputated. He did  not speculate concerning the origin of these injuries. However, it seems  likely that many or all of them were inflicted by the short-tailed shrew  (_Blarina brevicauda_). Five-lined skinks living on the same area were  likewise found to be scarred by bites which I identified (Fitch, 1954:  133) as bites of the short-tailed shrew. This shrew is common on the  Reservation, especially in woodland. Many have been trapped in the  pitfalls. On several occasions when a short-tailed shrew was caught in  the same pitfall with ant-eating frogs, it was found to have killed and  eaten them. Like the frogs, the shrews were most often caught in  pitfalls just after heavy rains. Once in 1954 a shrew was found at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#6)"],[1,"it effectually prevents my  cherishing any illusion as to my personal appearance. This is your  sister, of course, Renshaw; in fact, anyone could see that at a glance.  There is nothing like making acquaintances early on the voyage; the  first day is in that respect the most important of all.\"    \"Why is that?\" Marion asked.    \"Because as a rule the order in which people sit down to table on the  first day of the voyage is that in which they sit the whole time. Now,  if one happens to sit one's self down by people who turn out  disagreeable it is a very great nuisance, and therefore it is very  important to find out a little about one's fellow-passengers the first  day, so as to take a seat next to someone whom you are not likely to  quarrel with before you have been a week at sea.\"    \"Then they do not arrange places for you, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"Oh no; the captain perhaps settles as to who are to sit up by him. If  there is anyone of special importance, a governor or vice-governor or  any other big-wig, he and his wife, if he has got one, will probably sit  next to the captain on one side, if not, he will choose someone who has  been specially introduced to him or who has sailed with him before, and  the steward, before the party sit down, puts their names on their  plates; everyone else shifts for themselves. Renshaw, I shall be glad if  you will introduce me to your father and mother, and if we get on well I  will go down below and arrange that we get places together. I have been  chatting with the first officer, who is a very pleasant fellow; I have  sailed with him before. The rule is he sits at the end of the table  facing the captain, and my experience is that when the first officer  happens to be a good fellow, which is not always the case, his end of  the table is the most pleasant place. There is generally more fun and  laughing at that end than there is at the other; for all the people who  fancy that they are of importance make a point of getting seats as near  as they can to the captain, and important people are not, as a rule,  anything like as pleasant as the rest of us.\"    Wilfrid walked across the deck with Mr. Atherton to the point where his  father and mother were sitting. \"Mother, this is Mr. Atherton, who is in  my cabin.\" Mr. Atherton shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw.    \"I asked your son to introduce me at once, Mrs. Renshaw, because, as I  have been telling him, a good deal of the comfort of the voyage depends  upon making a snug little party to sit together at meals. There is  nothing I dread more than being put down between two acidulated women,  who make a point of showing by their manner every time one sits down  that they consider one is taking up a great deal more than one's share  of the seat.\"    Mrs. Renshaw smiled. \"I should think people were not often as rude as  that.\"    \"I can assure you that it is the rule rather than the exception, Mrs.  Renshaw. I am not a particularly sensitive man, I think; but I make a  point of avoiding crowded railway-carriages, being unable to withstand  the expression of blank dismay that comes over the faces of people when  I present myself at the door. I have thought sometimes of hiring a  little boy of about four years old to go about with me, as the two of us  would then only take up a fair share of space. I have been looking to  the cabin arrangements, and find that each seat holds three. Your son  and daughter are neither of them bulky, so if they won't mind sitting a  little close they will be conferring a genuine kindness upon me.\"    \"We shall not mind at all,\" Wilfrid and Marion exclaimed together, for  there was something so pleasant about Mr. Atherton's manner they felt  that he would be a delightful companion.    \"Very well, then; we will regard that as settled. Then we five will  occupy the seats on one side of the chief officer.\"    \"We will get the two Allens opposite,\" Wilfrid put in.    \"I will look about for three others to make up what I may call our  party. Who do you fancy, Mrs. Renshaw? Now look round and fix on  somebody, and I will undertake the duty of engineering the business.\"    \"There are two girls, sisters, in my cabin,\" Marion said. \"I think they  seem nice. They are going out alone to join their father and mother in  New Zealand.\"    \"In that case, Mrs. Renshaw, I had better leave the matter in your  hands.\"    \"That will be very simple, Mr. Atherton, as I have already spoken to  them,\" and she at once got up and moved across to two girls of about  thirteen and seventeen respectively, who were standing together watching  the passing ships, and entered into conversation with them. When she  proposed that, as they were in the same cabin with Marion, they should  sit near each other at table, they gladly agreed, saying, however, that  they had been placed under the special care of the captain, and as he  had said that he would keep them under his eye, they were afraid he  might want them to sit near him.    \"I will speak to the captain myself,\" Mrs. Renshaw said. \"I daresay he  will be rather glad to have the responsibility taken off his hands,  especially if I propose, which I will if you like, to take you under my  general charge.\"    \"Oh, we should like that very much,\" the elder of the two girls said.  \"It seems so very strange to us being here among so many people without  any lady with us. We should be so much obliged to you if you would take  us under your wing.\"    \"I can quite understand your feelings, my dears, and will speak to the  captain directly. I see that he is disengaged. If we were under sail  there would not be much chance of getting a word with him; but as the  tug has us in charge, I see that he has time to chat to the passengers.\"    A few minutes later the captain left the gentleman with whom he was  speaking and came along the deck. The Renshaws had made his acquaintance  when they first came down to see their cabins.    \"How are you, Mrs. Renshaw?\" he said as he came up to her. \"We have fine  weather for our start, have we not? It is a great thing starting fair,  as it enables people to settle down and make themselves at home.\"    \"I have been chatting with the Miss Mitfords, captain; they are in the  cabin with my daughter. They tell me that they are under your special  charge.\"    \"Yes, they are among the number of my responsibilities,\" the captain  said smiling.    \"They naturally feel rather lonely on board from having no lady with  them, and have expressed their willingness to put themselves under my  charge if you will sanction it. It will be pleasant both for them and my  daughter, and they can sit down with us at meals, and make a party  together to work or read on deck.\"    \"I shall be extremely glad, Mrs. Renshaw, if you will accept the  responsibility. A captain's hands are full enough without having to look  after women. There are four or five single ladies on board, on all of  whom I have promised to keep a watchful eye, and I shall be delighted to  be relieved of the responsibility of two of them.\"    So the matter was arranged, and going down into the cabin a few minutes  before the bell rang for dinner, the party succeeded in getting the  places they desired. Mr. Atherton was next to the chief officer. Wilfrid  sat next to him, Marion between her brother and Mrs. Renshaw, and Mr.  Renshaw next. The two Allens faced Mr. Atherton and Wilfrid; the Miss  Mitfords came next, facing Marion and her mother. A Captain Pearson and  his wife were next to the Mitfords, while a civil engineer, Mr.  Halbrook, occupied the vacant seat next to Mr. Renshaw. Once seated, the  Renshaws speedily congratulated themselves on the arrangements that they  had made as they saw the hesitating way in which the rest of the  passengers took their places, and the looks of inquiry and doubt they  cast at those who seated themselves next to them. For a time the meal  was a silent one, friends talking together in low voices, but nothing  like a general conversation being attempted. At the first officers' end  of the table, however, the sound of conversation and laughter began at  once.    \"Have you room, Miss Renshaw? or do you already begin to regret your  bargain?\"    \"I have plenty of room, thank you,\" Marion replied. \"I hope that you  have enough?\"    \"Plenty,\" Mr. Atherton answered. \"I have just been telling your brother  that if he finds I am squeezing him he must run his elbow into my ribs.  Let me see, Mr. Ryan; it must be three years since we sat together.\"    \"Just about that,\" the mate replied with a strong Irish accent. \"You  went with us from Japan to Singapore, did you not?\"    \"That was it, and a rough bout we had of it in that cyclone in the China  Seas. You remember that I saved the ship then?\"    \"How was that, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid asked.    The first officer laughed. \"Mr. Atherton always took a deal more credit  to himself than we gave him. When the cyclone struck the ship and  knocked her right down on her beam-ends, he happened to be sitting up to  windward, and he always declared that if it hadn't been for his weight  the ship would never have righted itself.\"    There was a general laugh at the mate's explanation.    \"I always plant myself to windward in a gale,\" Mr. Atherton said  gravely. \"Shifting ballast is a most useful thing, although they have  abolished it in yacht-racing. I was once in a canoe, down by Borneo,  when a heavy squall struck us. I was sitting in the bottom of the boat  when we saw it coming, and had just time to get up and sit on the  weather gunwale when it struck us. If it had not been for me nothing  could have saved the boat from capsizing. As it was it stood up as stiff  as a rock, though, I own, I nearly drowned them all when the blow was  over, for it stopped as suddenly as it began, and the boat as nearly as  possible capsized with my weight. Indeed it would have done so  altogether if it hadn't heeled over so sharply that I was chucked"]]]
