That I'm--\"    \"Why did you kill him, then?\" Tasso said.    \"I told you.\" Klaus shook his head wearily. \"I thought he was a claw.  I thought I knew.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I had been watching him. I was suspicious.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I thought I had seen something. Heard something. I thought I--\" He  stopped.    \"Go on.\"    \"We were sitting at the table. Playing cards. You two were in the  other room. It was silent. I thought I heard him--_whirr_.\"    There was silence.    \"Do you believe that?\" Tasso said to Hendricks.    \"Yes. I believe what he says.\"    \"I don't. I think he killed Rudi for a good purpose.\" Tasso touched  the rifle, resting in the corner of the room. \"Major--\"    \"No.\" Hendricks shook his head. \"Let's stop it right now. One is  enough. We're afraid, the way he was. If we kill him we'll be doing  what he did to Rudi.\"    Klaus looked gratefully up at him. \"Thanks. I was afraid. You  understand, don't you? Now she's afraid, the way I was. She wants to  kill me.\"    \"No more killing.\" Hendricks moved toward the end of the ladder. \"I'm  going above and try the transmitter once more. If I can't get them  we're moving back toward my lines tomorrow morning.\"    Klaus rose quickly. \"I'll come up with you and give you a hand.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The night air was cold. The earth was cooling off. Klaus took a deep  breath, filling his lungs. He and Hendricks stepped onto the ground,  out of the tunnel. Klaus planted his feet wide apart, the rifle up,  watching and listening. Hendricks crouched by the tunnel mouth, tuning  the small transmitter.    \"Any luck?\" Klaus asked presently.    \"Not yet.\"    \"Keep trying. Tell them what happened.\"    Hendricks kept trying. Without success. Finally he lowered the  antenna. \"It's useless. They can't hear me. Or they hear me and won't  answer. Or--\"    \"Or they don't exist.\"    \"I'll try once more.\" Hendricks raised the antenna. \"Scott, can you  hear me? Come in!\"    He listened. There was only static. Then, still very faintly--    \"This is Scott.\"    His fingers tightened. \"Scott! Is it you?\"    \"This is Scott.\"    Klaus squatted down. \"Is it your command?\"    \"Scott, listen. Do you understand? About them, the claws. Did you get  my message? Did you hear me?\"    \"Yes.\" Faintly. Almost inaudible. He could hardly make out the word.    \"You got my message? Is everything all right at the bunker? None of  them have got in?\"    \"Everything is all right.\"    \"Have they tried to get in?\"    The voice was weaker.    \"No.\"    Hendricks turned to Klaus. \"They're all right.\"    \"Have they been attacked?\"    \"No.\" Hendricks pressed the phone tighter to his ear. \"Scott, I can  hardly hear you. Have you notified the Moon Base? Do they know? Are  they alerted?\"    No answer.    \"Scott! Can you hear me?\"    Silence.    Hendricks relaxed, sagging. \"Faded out. Must be radiation pools.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks and Klaus looked at each other. Neither of them said  anything. After a time Klaus said, \"Did it sound like any of your men?  Could you identify the voice?\"    \"It was too faint.\"    \"You couldn't be certain?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then it could have been--\"    \"I don't know. Now I'm not sure. Let's go back down and get the lid  closed.\"    They climbed back down the ladder slowly, into the warm cellar. Klaus  bolted the lid behind them. Tasso waited for them, her face  expressionless.    \"Any luck?\" she asked.    Neither of them answered. \"Well?\" Klaus said at last. \"What do you  think, Major? Was it your officer, or was it one of _them_?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Then we're just where we were before.\"    Hendricks stared down at the floor, his jaw set. \"We'll have to go. To  be sure.\"    \"Anyhow, we have food here for only a few weeks. We'd have to go up  after that, in any case.\"    \"Apparently so.\"    \"What's wrong?\" Tasso demanded. \"Did you get across to your bunker?  What's the matter?\"    \"It may have been one of my men,\" Hendricks said slowly. \"Or it may  have been one of _them_. But we'll never know standing here.\" He  examined his watch. \"Let's turn in and get some sleep. We want to be  up early tomorrow.\"    \"Early?\"    \"Our best chance to get through the claws should be early in the  morning,\" Hendricks said.           *       *       *       *       *    The morning was crisp and clear. Major Hendricks studied the  countryside through his fieldglasses.    \"See anything?\" Klaus said.    \"No.\"    \"Can you make out our bunkers?\"    \"Which way?\"    \"Here.\" Klaus took the glasses and adjusted them. \"I know where to  look.\" He looked a long time, silently.    Tasso came to the top of the tunnel and stepped up onto the ground.  \"Anything?\"    \"No.\" Klaus passed the glasses back to Hendricks. \"They're out of  sight. Come on. Let's not stay here.\"    The three of them made their way down the side of the ridge, sliding  in the soft ash. Across a flat rock a lizard scuttled. They stopped  instantly, rigid.    \"What was it?\" Klaus muttered.    \"A lizard.\"    The lizard ran on, hurrying through the ash. It was exactly the same  color as the ash.    \"Perfect adaptation,\" Klaus said. \"Proves we were right. Lysenko, I  mean.\"    They reached the bottom of the ridge and stopped, standing close  together, looking around them.    \"Let's go.\" Hendricks started off. \"It's a good long trip, on foot.\"    Klaus fell in beside him. Tasso walked behind, her pistol held  alertly. \"Major, I've been meaning to ask you something,\" Klaus said.  \"How did you run across the David? The one that was tagging you.\"    \"I met it along the way. In some ruins.\"    \"What did it say?\"    \"Not much. It said it was alone. By itself.\"    \"You couldn't tell it was a machine? It talked like a living person?  You never suspected?\"    \"It didn't say much. I noticed nothing unusual.    \"It's strange, machines so much like people that you can be fooled.  Almost alive. I wonder where it'll end.\"    \"They're doing what you Yanks designed them to do,\" Tasso said. \"You  designed them to hunt out life and destroy. Human life. Wherever they  find it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks was watching Klaus intently. \"Why did you ask me? What's on  your mind?\"    \"Nothing,\" Klaus answered.    \"Klaus thinks you're the Second Variety,\" Tasso said calmly, from  behind them. \"Now he's got his eye on you.\"    Klaus flushed. \"Why not? We sent a runner to the Yank lines and he  comes back. Maybe he thought he'd find some good game here.\"    Hendricks laughed harshly. \"I came from the UN bunkers. There were  human beings all around me.\"    \"Maybe you saw an opportunity to get into the Soviet lines. Maybe you  saw your chance. Maybe you--\"    \"The Soviet lines had already been taken over. Your lines had been  invaded before I left my command bunker. Don't forget that.\"    Tasso came up beside him. \"That proves nothing at all, Major.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"There appears to be little communication between the varieties. Each  is made in a different factory. They don't seem to work together. You  might have started for the Soviet lines without knowing anything about  the work of the other varieties. Or even what the other varieties were  like.\"    \"How do you know so much about the claws?\" Hendricks said.    \"I've seen them. I've observed them. I observed them take over the  Soviet bunkers.\"    \"You know quite a lot,\" Klaus said. \"Actually, you saw very little.  Strange that you should have been such an acute observer.\"    Tasso laughed. \"Do you suspect me, now?\"    \"Forget it,\" Hendricks said. They walked on in silence.    \"Are we going the whole way on foot?\" Tasso said, after awhile. \"I'm  not used to walking.\" She gazed around at the plain of ash, stretching  out on all sides of them, as far as they could see. \"How dreary.\"    \"It's like this all the way,\" Klaus said.    \"In a way I wish you had been in your bunker when the attack came.\"    \"Somebody else would have been with you, if not me,\" Klaus muttered.    Tasso laughed, putting her hands in her pockets. \"I suppose so.\"    They walked on, keeping their eyes on the vast plain of silent ash  around them.           *       *       *       *       *    The sun was setting. Hendricks made his way forward slowly, waving  Tasso and Klaus back. Klaus squatted down, resting his gun butt  against the ground.    Tasso found a concrete slab and sat down with a sigh. \"It's good to  rest.\"    \"Be quiet,\" Klaus said sharply.    Hendricks pushed up to the top of the rise ahead of them. The same  rise the Russian runner had come up, the day before. Hendricks dropped  down, stretching himself out, peering through his glasses at what lay  beyond.    Nothing was visible. Only ash and occasional trees. But there, not  more than fifty yards ahead, was the entrance of the forward command  bunker. The bunker from which he had come. Hendricks watched silently.  No motion. No sign of life. Nothing stirred.    Klaus slithered up beside him. \"Where is it?\"    \"Down there.\" Hendricks passed him the glasses. Clouds of ash rolled  across the evening sky. The world was darkening. They had a couple of  hours of light left, at the most. Probably not that much.    \"I don't see anything,\" Klaus said.    \"That tree there. The stump. By the pile of bricks. The entrance is to  the right of the bricks.\"    \"I'll have to take your word for it.\"    \"You and Tasso cover me from here. You'll be able to sight all the way  to the bunker entrance.\"    \"You're going down alone?\"    \"With my wrist tab I'll be safe. The ground around the bunker is a  living field of claws. They collect down in the ash. Like crabs.  Without tabs you wouldn't have a chance.\"    \"Maybe you're right.\"    \"I'll walk slowly all the way. As soon as I know for certain--\"    \"If they're down inside the bunker you won't be able to get back up  here. They go fast. You don't realize.\"    \"What do you suggest?\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#6)"],[1," too; and as I was being led to the table, everyone on  both sides stood up as if they were leading some great lord.  There were among them men of high position, who all showed  me the greatest respect and bowed low to me, and said they  would do everything in their power to serve and please me.  And as I sat there in honour, there came the messenger of  the Town Council of Antwerp with two servants and presented  to me four cans of wine from the Magistrates of Antwerp, who  told him to say that they wished thereby to show their  respect for me and to assure me of their good-will;  wherefore I returned them my humble thanks and offered my  humble services. Thereupon came Master Peter, the town  carpenter, and gave me two cans of wine with offer of his  willing service; so when we had spent a long time together  merrily, till late into the night, they accompanied us home  with lanterns in great honour. They begged me to be assured  of their good-will, and promised that in whatever I did they  would help me in every way; so I thanked them, and laid down  to sleep.    Also I have been in Master Quentin's house, and I have been  in all the three great shooting places. [Editor's note:  Quentin Matsys, the painter].  I had a very splendid dinner  at Staiber's. Another time at the Portuguese factor's, whose  portrait I have drawn in charcoal; I have made a portrait of  my host as well; Jobst Plankfelt gave me a branch of white  coral; paid 2 stivers for butter and 2 stivers to the joiner  at the Painters' armoury.    Also my host took me to the Painters' workshop in the  armoury at Antwerp, where they are making the triumphal  arches through which King Charles is to make his entry. It  is 400 bows in length and each arch is 40 feet wide: they  are to be set up on both sides of the streets, beautifully  arranged and two stories high, and on them they are to act  the plays; and this costs to make, 4,000 florins for the  joiners and painters, and the whole work is very  magnificently done.    I have dined again with the Portuguese factor, and once with  Alexander Imhof. Sebald Fischer bought of me at Antwerp  sixteen \"Small Passions\" for 4 florins, thirty-two of the  large books for 8 florins, also six engraved \"Passions\" for  3 florins, also twenty half-sheets of all kinds taken  together at 1 florin to the value of 3 florins, and again 5  1/4 florins' worth of quarter-sheets,--forty-five of all  kinds at 1 florin, and eight miscellaneous leaves at 1  florin; it is paid.    To my host I have sold a \"Madonna\" picture, painted on small  canvas, for 2 florins Rhenish. I took once more the portrait  of Felix the lute player. 1 stiver for pears and bread; 2  stivers to the surgeon-barber: besides I have given 14  stivers for three small panels, besides 4 stivers for laying  in the white and preparing them. I have dined once with  Alexander the goldsmith, and once with Felix Hungersberg;  once Master Joachim has eaten with me, and his partner also  once.    I have made a drawing in half colours for the Painters. I  have taken 1 florin for expenses. I made Peter Wolffgang a  present of four new little pieces. Master Joachim's partner  has again dined with me. I gave Master Joachim 1 florin's  worth of prints for lending me his apprentice and colours,  and I gave his apprentice 3 crowns' worth of prints. I have  sent the four new pieces to Alexander, the goldsmith. I made  charcoal portraits of these Genoese by name: Tomasin  Florianus Romanus, native of Lucca, and his two brothers,  named Vincentius and Gerhard, all three Bombelli.    I have dined with Tomasin so often: IIIIIIIIIIII. The  treasurer also gave me a \"Child's Head\" on linen and a  weapon from Calicut, and one of the light wood reeds.  Tomasin Imhof has also given me a plaited hat of elder pith.    I dined once more with the Portuguese; I also gave one of  Tomasin's brothers 3 florins' worth of engravings. Herr  Erasmus has given me a small Spanish mantilla and three  portraits of men. Tomasin's brother gave me a pair of gloves  for 3 florins' worth of engravings. I have once more made  the portrait of Tomasin's brother Vincentius; and I gave  Master Augustus Lombard two of the Imagines. Moreover, I  made a portrait of the crooked-nosed Italian named Opitius.  Also my wife and maid dined one day at Herr Tomasin's; that  makes four meals.    Our Lady's Church at Antwerp is so vast that many masses may  be sung there at one time without interfering one with  another. The altars are richly endowed; the best musicians  that can be had are employed; the Church has many devout  services and much stonework, and in particular a beautiful  tower. I also visited the rich Abbey of St. Michael, where  are the finest galleries of stonework that I have ever seen,  and a rich throne in the choir. But at Antwerp they spare no  cost in such things, for they have plenty of money.    I have made a portrait of Herr Nicolas, an astronomer who  lives with the King of England, and is very helpful and of  great service to me in many matters. He is a German, a  native of Munich. Also I have made the portrait of Tomasin's  daughter, Maid Zutta by name. Hans Pfaffroth gave me a  Philip's florin for taking his portrait in charcoal. I have  dined once more with Tomasin. My host's brother-in-law  entertained me and my wife once. I changed 2 light florins  for 24 stivers for living expenses; and I gave 1 stiver for  a tip to a man who let me see an altar-piece.    The Sunday after the Feast of the Assumption I saw the great  procession of Our Lady's Church at Antwerp, where all the  whole town was gathered together, with all the trades and  professions, and each was dressed in his best according to  his rank; every guild and profession had its sign by which  it might be recognized. Between the companies were carried  great costly gold pole-candlesticks and their long old  Frankish silver trumpets; and there were many pipers and  drummers in the German fashion; all were loudly and noisily  blown and beaten. I saw the procession pass along the  street, spread far apart so that they took up much space  crossways, but close behind one another: goldsmiths,  painters, stonecutters, broiderers, sculptors, joiners,  carpenters, sailors, fishermen, butchers, leather workers,  cloth makers, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, and all kinds of  craftsmen and workmen who work for their livelihood.  There were likewise shopkeepers and merchants with their  assistants of all sorts. After them came the marksmen with  their guns, bows, and cross-bows; then the horsemen and foot  soldiers; then came a large company of the town guard; then  a fine troop of very gallant men, nobly and splendidly  costumed. Before them, however, went all the religious  orders and the members of some foundations, very devoutly,  in their respective groups. There was, too, in this  procession, a great troop of widows, who support themselves  by their own labour and observe special rules, all dressed  from head to foot in white linen robes made expressly for  the occasion, very sorrowful to behold. Among them I saw  some very stately persons, the Canons of Our Lady's Church  with all their clergy, scholars, and treasures. Twenty  persons bore the image of the Virgin Mary and of the Lord  Jesus, adorned in the richest manner, to the honour of the  Lord God. The procession included many delightful things  splendidly got up, for example, many wagons were drawn along  with stagings of ships and other constructions. Then there  came the company of the Prophets in their order, and scenes  from the New Testament, such as the Annunciation, the Three  Magi riding great camels, and other strange beasts, very  skillfully arranged, and also how Our Lady fled into Egypt--  very conducive to devotion--and many other things which for  shortness I must leave out. Last of all came a great dragon,  which St. Margaret and her maidens led by a girdle; she was  extraordinarily beautiful. Behind her followed a St. George  with his squire, a very fine cuirassier. There also rode in  the procession many pretty and richly dressed boys and girls  in the costumes of many lands representing various saints.  This procession from beginning to end, where it passed our  house, lasted more than two hours; there were so many things  there that I could not write them in a book, so I let it  alone.    I visited Fugger's house in Antwerp, which is newly built,  with a wonderful tower, broad and high, and with a beautiful  garden, and I also saw his fine stallions. Tomasin has given  my wife fourteen ells of good thick arras for a mantle and  three and a half ells of half satin to line it. I drew a  design for a lady's forehead band for the goldsmith.    The Portuguese factor has given me a present of wine in the  inn, both Portuguese and French. Signor Rodrigo of Portugal  has given me a small cask full of all sorts of sweetmeats,  amongst them a box of sugar candy, besides two large dishes  of barley sugar, marchpane, many other kinds of sugar-work,  and some sugar-canes just as they grow; I gave his servant  in return 1 florin as a tip. I have again changed for my  expenses a light florin for 12 stivers.    The pillars in the Convent of St. Michael of Antwerp are all  made out of single blocks of a beautiful black touchstone.  Herr Egidius, King Charles's warden, has taken for me from  Antwerp the \"St. Jerome in the Cell,\" the \"Melancholy,\" and  three new \"Marys,\" the \"Anthony\" and the \"Veronica\" for the  good sculptor, Master Conrad, whose like I have not seen; he  serves Lady Margaret, the Emperor's daughter. Also I gave  Master Figidius a \"Eustace\" and a \"Nemesis.\" I owe my host 7  florins, 20 stivers, I thaler--that is, on Sunday before St.  Bartholomew: for sitting room, bedroom, and bedding I am to  pay him 11 florins a month.    I came to a new agreement with my host on the 20th August--  on the Monday before St, Bartholomew's, I am to eat with him  and pay 2"]]]
