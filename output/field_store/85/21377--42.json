But Lily knew nothing  of these discriminations, and could only pronounce her sister's career  a strange anti-climax--an impression confirmed by the fact that Isabel's  silence about Mr. Osmond, for instance, was in direct proportion to the  frequency with which he occupied her thoughts. As this happened very  often it sometimes appeared to Mrs. Ludlow that she had lost her  courage. So uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as  inheriting a fortune was of course perplexing to the cheerful Lily; it  added to her general sense that Isabel was not at all like other people.    Our young lady's courage, however, might have been taken as reaching  its height after her relations had gone home. She could imagine braver  things than spending the winter in Paris--Paris had sides by which it  so resembled New York, Paris was like smart, neat prose--and her close  correspondence with Madame Merle did much to stimulate such flights. She  had never had a keener sense of freedom, of the absolute boldness and  wantonness of liberty, than when she turned away from the platform  at the Euston Station on one of the last days of November, after the  departure of the train that was to convey poor Lily, her husband and her  children to their ship at Liverpool. It had been good for her to regale;  she was very conscious of that; she was very observant, as we know, of  what was good for her, and her effort was constantly to find something  that was good enough. To profit by the present advantage till the latest  moment she had made the journey from Paris with the unenvied travellers.  She would have accompanied them to Liverpool as well, only Edmund Ludlow  had asked her, as a favour, not to do so; it made Lily so fidgety and  she asked such impossible questions. Isabel watched the train move away;  she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews, a demonstrative  child who leaned dangerously far out of the window of the carriage and  made separation an occasion of violent hilarity, and then she walked  back into the foggy London street. The world lay before her--she could  do whatever she chose. There was a deep thrill in it all, but for the  present her choice was tolerably discreet; she chose simply to walk back  from Euston Square to her hotel. The early dusk of a November afternoon  had already closed in; the street-lamps, in the thick, brown air, looked  weak and red; our heroine was unattended and Euston Square was a long  way from Piccadilly. But Isabel performed the journey with a positive  enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose, in order  to get more sensations, so that she was disappointed when an obliging  policeman easily set her right again. She was so fond of the spectacle  of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the  London streets--the moving crowds, the hurrying cabs, the lighted shops,  the flaring stalls, the dark, shining dampness of everything. That  evening, at her hotel, she wrote to Madame Merle that she should start  in a day or two for Rome. She made her way down to Rome without touching  at Florence--having gone first to Venice and then proceeded southward by  Ancona. She accomplished this journey without other assistance than that  of her servant, for her natural protectors were not now on the ground.  Ralph Touchett was spending the winter at Corfu, and Miss Stackpole, in  the September previous, had been recalled to America by a telegram from  the Interviewer. This journal offered its brilliant correspondent a  fresher field for her genius than the mouldering cities of Europe, and  Henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from Mr. Bantling that  he would soon come over to see her. Isabel wrote to Mrs. Touchett to  apologise for not presenting herself just yet in Florence, and her aunt  replied characteristically enough. Apologies, Mrs. Touchett intimated,  were of no more use to her than bubbles, and she herself never dealt  in such articles. One either did the thing or one didn't, and what one  \"would\" have done belonged to the sphere of the irrelevant, like the  idea of a future life or of the origin of things. Her letter was frank,  but (a rare case with Mrs. Touchett) not so frank as it pretended. She  easily forgave her niece for not stopping at Florence, because she  took it for a sign that Gilbert Osmond was less in question there than  formerly. She watched of course to see if he would now find a pretext  for going to Rome, and derived some comfort from learning that he had  not been guilty of an absence. Isabel, on her side, had not been a  fortnight in Rome before she proposed to Madame Merle that they should  make a little pilgrimage to the East. Madame Merle remarked that her  friend was restless, but she added that she herself had always been  consumed with the desire to visit Athens and Constantinople. The two  ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition, and spent three months  in Greece, in Turkey, in Egypt. Isabel found much to interest her in  these countries, though Madame Merle continued to remark that even among  the most classic sites, the scenes most calculated to suggest repose  and reflexion, a certain incoherence prevailed in her. Isabel travelled  rapidly and recklessly; she was like a thirsty person draining cup  after cup. Madame Merle meanwhile, as lady-in-waiting to a princess  circulating incognita, panted a little in her rear. It was on Isabel's  invitation she had come, and she imparted all due dignity to the girl's  uncountenanced state. She played her part with the tact that might have  been expected of her, effacing herself and accepting the position of a  companion whose expenses were profusely paid. The situation, however,  had no hardships, and people who met this reserved though striking  pair on their travels would not have been able to tell you which  was patroness and which client. To say that Madame Merle improved on  acquaintance states meagrely the impression she made on her friend,  who had found her from the first so ample and so easy. At the end of an  intimacy of three months Isabel felt she knew her better; her character  had revealed itself, and the admirable woman had also at last redeemed  her promise of relating her history from her own point of view--a  consummation the more desirable as Isabel had already heard it related  from the point of view of others. This history was so sad a one (in so  far as it concerned the late M. Merle, a positive adventurer, she might  say, though originally so plausible, who had taken advantage, years  before, of her youth and of an inexperience in which doubtless those who  knew her only now would find it difficult to believe); it abounded so in  startling and lamentable incidents that her companion wondered a person  so eprouvee could have kept so much of her freshness, her interest in  life. Into this freshness of Madame Merle's she obtained a considerable  insight; she seemed to see it as professional, as slightly mechanical,  carried about in its case like the fiddle of the virtuoso, or blanketed  and bridled like the \"favourite\" of the jockey. She liked her as much  as ever, but there was a corner of the curtain that never was lifted;  it was as if she had remained after all something of a public performer,  condemned to emerge only in character and in costume. She had once  said that she came from a distance, that she belonged to the \"old, old\"  world, and Isabel never lost the impression that she was the product of  a different moral or social clime from her own, that she had grown up  under other stars.    She believed then that at bottom she had a different morality. Of course  the morality of civilised persons has always much in common; but our  young woman had a sense in her of values gone wrong or, as they said at  the shops, marked down. She considered, with the presumption of youth,  that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it; and this  conviction was an aid to detecting an occasional flash of cruelty, an  occasional lapse from candour, in the conversation of a person who had  raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for  the narrow ways of deception. Her conception of human motives might,  in certain lights, have been acquired at the court of some kingdom in  decadence, and there were several in her list of which our heroine had  not even heard. She had not heard of everything, that was very plain;  and there were evidently things in the world of which it was not  advantageous to hear. She had once or twice had a positive scare; since  it so affected her to have to exclaim, of her friend, \"Heaven forgive  her, she doesn't understand me!\" Absurd as it may seem this discovery  operated as a shock, left her with a vague dismay in which there was  even an element of foreboding. The dismay of course subsided, in the  light of some sudden proof of Madame Merle's remarkable intelligence;  but it stood for a high-water-mark in the ebb and flow of confidence.  Madame Merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases  to grow it immediately begins to decline--there being no point of  equilibrium between liking more and liking less. A stationary affection,  in other words, was impossible--it must move one way or the other.  However that might be, the girl had in these days a thousand uses for  her sense of the romantic, which was more active than it had ever been.  I do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the Pyramids  in the course of an excursion from Cairo, or as she stood among the  broken columns of the Acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point  designated to her as the Strait of Salamis; deep and memorable as these  emotions had remained.

But he  wasn't interested enough to go to the trouble of opening his sore eyes.    \"Going to Pyrrus. I tried to talk him out of it, of course, but I  couldn't change his mind. It's a shame, too, I would like to have done  more for him. He's the one who got the money for us.\"    \"Oh, that's awful,\" the girl said. Jason wondered why it was _awful_. It  didn't make sense to his groggy mind. \"It would have been much better if  he stayed on Darkhan,\" the girl continued. \"He's very nice-looking. I  think it's a shame he has to die.\"    That was too much for Jason. He pried one eye open, then the other. The  voice belonged to a girl about twenty-one who was standing next to the  bed, gazing down at Jason. She was beautiful.    Jason's eyes opened wider as he realized she was _very_ beautiful--with  the kind of beauty never found in the civilized galaxy. The women he had  known all ran to pale skin, hollow shoulders, gray faces covered with  tints and dyes. They were the product of centuries of breeding  weaknesses back into the race, as the advance of medicine kept alive  more and more non-survival types.    This girl was the direct opposite in every way. She was the product of  survival on Pyrrus. The heavy gravity that produced bulging muscles in  men, brought out firm strength in straplike female muscles. She had the  figure of a goddess, tanned skin and perfectly formed face. Her hair,  which was cut short, circled her head like a golden crown. The only  unfeminine thing about her was the gun she wore in a bulky forearm  holster. When she saw Jason's eyes open she smiled at him. Her teeth  were as even and as white as he had expected.    \"I'm Meta, pilot of this ship. And you must be--\"    \"Jason dinAlt. That was a lousy take-off, Meta.\"    \"I'm really very sorry,\" she laughed. \"But being born on a two-G planet  does make one a little immune to acceleration. I save fuel too, with the  synergy curve--\"    Kerk gave a noncommittal grunt. \"Come along, Meta, we'll take a look at  the cargo. Some of the new stuff will plug the gaps in the perimeter.\"    \"Oh yes,\" she said, almost clapping her hands with happiness. \"I read  the specs, they're simply wonderful.\"    _Like a schoolgirl with a new dress. Or a box of candy. That's a great  attitude to have towards bombs and flame-throwers._ Jason smiled wryly  at the thought as he groaned off the couch. The two Pyrrans had gone and  he pulled himself painfully through the door after them.           *       *       *       *       *    It took him a long time to find his way to the hold. The ship was big  and apparently empty of crew. Jason finally found a man sleeping in one  of the brightly lit cabins. He recognized him as the driver who had  turned the car over to them on Cassylia. The man, who had been sleeping  soundly a moment before, opened his eyes as soon as Jason drifted into  the room. He was wide awake.    \"How do I get to the cargo hold?\" Jason asked.    The other told him, closed his eyes and went instantly back to sleep  before Jason could even say thanks.    In the hold, Kerk and Meta had opened some of the crates and were  chortling with joy over their lethal contents. Meta, a pressure canister  in her arms, turned to Jason as he came through the door.    \"Just look at this,\" she said. \"This powder in here--why you can eat it  like dirt, with less harm. Yet it is instantly deadly to all forms of  vegetable life ...\" She stopped suddenly as she realized Jason didn't  share her extreme pleasure. \"I'm sorry. I forgot for a moment there that  you weren't a Pyrran. So you don't really understand, do you?\"    Before he could answer, the PA speaker called her name.    \"Jump time,\" she said. \"Come with me to the bridge while I do the  equations. We can talk there. I know so little about any place except  Pyrrus that I have a million questions to ask.\"    Jason followed her to the bridge where she relieved the duty officer and  began taking readings for the jump-setting. She looked out of place  among the machines, a sturdy but supple figure in a simple, one-piece  shipsuit. Yet there was no denying the efficiency with which she went  about her job.    \"Meta, aren't you a little young to be the pilot of an interstellar  ship?\"    \"Am I?\" She thought for a second. \"I really don't know how old pilots  are supposed to be. I have been piloting for about three years now and  I'm almost twenty. Is that younger than usual?\"    Jason opened his mouth--then laughed. \"I suppose that all depends on  what planet you're from. Some places you would have trouble getting  licensed. But I'll bet things are different on Pyrrus. By their  standards you must rank as an old lady.\"    \"Now you're making a joke,\" Meta said serenely as she fed a figure into  the calculator. \"I've seen old ladies on some planets. They are wrinkled  and have gray hair. I don't know how old they are, I asked one but she  wouldn't tell me her age. But I'm sure they must be older than anyone on  Pyrrus, no one looks like that there.\"    \"I don't mean old that way,\" Jason groped for the right word. \"Not  old--but grown-up, mature. An adult.\"    \"Everyone is grown-up,\" she answered. \"At least soon after they leave  the wards. And they do that when they're six. My first child is  grown-up, and the second one would be, too, only he's dead. So I  _surely_ must be.\"    That seemed to settle the question for her, though Jason's thoughts  jumped with the alien concepts and background, inherent behind her  words.           *       *       *       *       *    Meta punched in the last setting, and the course tape began to chunk out  of the case. She turned her attention back to Jason. \"I'm glad you're  aboard this trip, though I am sorry you are going to Pyrrus. But we'll  have lots of time to talk. There are so many things I want to find out  about other planets, and why people go around acting the way they do.  Not at all like home where you _know_ why people are doing things all  the time.\" She frowned over the tape for a moment, then turned her  attention back to Jason. \"What is your home planet like?\"    One after another the usual lies he told people came to his lips, and  were pushed away. Why bother lying to a girl who really didn't care if  you were serf or noble? To her there were only two kinds of people in  the galaxy--Pyrrans, and the rest. For the first time since he had fled  from Porgorstorsaand he found himself telling someone the truth of his  origin.    \"My home planet? Just about the stuffiest, dullest, dead-end in the  universe. You can't believe the destructive decay of a planet that is  mainly agrarian, caste-conscious and completely satisfied with its own  boring existence. Not only is there no change--but no one _wants_  change. My father was a farmer, so I should have been a farmer too--if I  had listened to the advice of my betters. It was unthinkable, as well as  forbidden for me to do anything else. And everything I wanted to do was  against the law. I was fifteen before I learned to read--out of a book  stolen from a noble school. After that there was no turning back. By the  time I stowed aboard an off-world freighter at nineteen I must have  broken every law on the planet. Happily. Leaving home for me was just  like getting out of prison.\"    Meta shook her head at the thought. \"I just can't imagine a place like  that. But I'm sure I wouldn't like it there.\"    \"I'm sure you wouldn't,\" Jason laughed. \"So once I was in space, with no  law-abiding talents or skills, I just wandered into one thing and  another. In this age of technology I was completely out of place. Oh, I  suppose I could have done well in some army, but I'm not so good at  taking orders. Whenever I gambled I did well, so little by little I just  drifted into it. People are the same everywhere, so I manage to make out  well wherever I end up.\"    \"I know what you mean about people being alike--but they are so  _different_,\" she said. \"I'm not being clear at all, am I? What I mean  is that at home I know what people will do and why they do it at the  same time. People on all the other planets do act alike, as you said,  yet I have very much trouble understanding why. For instance, I like to  try the local food when we set down on a planet, and if there is time I  always do. There are bars and restaurants near every spaceport so I go  there. And I always have trouble with the men. They want to buy me  drinks, hold my hand--\"    \"Well, a single girl in those port joints has to expect a certain amount  of interest from the men.\"    \"Oh, I know that,\" she said. \"What I don't understand is why they don't  listen when I tell them I am not interested and to go away. They just  laugh and pull up a chair, usually. But I have found that one thing  works wherever I am. I tell them if they don't stop bothering me I'll  break their arm.\"    \"Does that stop them?\" Jason asked.    \"No, of course not. But after I break their arm they go away. And the  others don't bother me either. It's a lot of fuss to go through and the  food is usually awful.\"    Jason didn't laugh. Particularly when he realized that this girl _could_  break the arm of any spaceport thug in the galaxy. She was a strange  mixture of naivete and strength, unlike anyone he had ever met before.  Once again he realized that he _had_ to visit the planet that produced  people like her and Kerk.    \"Tell me about Pyrrus,\" he asked. \"Why is it that you and Kerk assume  automatically that I will drop dead as soon as I land? What is the  planet like?\"    All the warmth was gone from her face now. \"I can't tell you. You will  have to see for yourself. I know that much after visiting some of the  other worlds. Pyrrus is like nothing you galaxy people have ever  experienced. You won't really believe it until it is too late. Will you  promise me something?\"    \"No,\" he answered. \"At least not until after I hear what it is and  decide.\"    \"Don'"]]]
