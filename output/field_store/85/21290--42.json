So Mary went quietly and alone to church. St. Paul's stood in a  neighbouring street, and its Gothic design would have interested a  curious inquirer into the history of a strange revival. Obviously,  mechanically, there was nothing amiss. The style chosen was 'geometrical  decorated,' and the tracery of the windows seemed correct. The nave, the  aisles, the spacious chancel, were reasonably proportioned; and, to be  quite serious, the only feature obviously wrong was the substitution of  a low 'chancel wall' with iron gates for the rood screen with the loft  and rood. But this, it might plausibly be contended, was merely an  adaptation of the old idea to modern requirements, and it would have  been quite difficult to explain why the whole building, from the mere  mortar setting between the stones to the Gothic gas standards, was a  mysterious and elaborate blasphemy. The canticles were sung to Joll in B  flat, the chants were 'Anglican,' and the sermon was the gospel for the  day, amplified and rendered into the more modern and graceful English of  the preacher. And Mary came away.    After their dinner (an excellent piece of Australian mutton, bought in  the 'World Wide' Stores, in Hammersmith), they sat for some time in the  garden, partly sheltered by the big mulberry tree from the observation  of their neighbours. Edward smoked his honeydew, and Mary looked at him  with placid affection.    'You never tell me about the men in your office,' she said at length.  'Some of them are nice fellows, aren't they?'    'Oh, yes, they're very decent. I must bring some of them round, one of  these days.'    He remembered with a pang that it would be necessary to provide whisky.  One couldn't ask the guest to drink table beer at tenpence the gallon.    'Who are they, though?' said Mary. 'I think they might have given you a  wedding present.'    'Well, I don't know. We never have gone in for that sort of thing. But  they're very decent chaps. Well, there's Harvey; \"Sauce\" they call him  behind his back. He's mad on bicycling. He went in last year for the  Two Miles Amateur Record. He'd have made it, too, if he could have got  into better training.    'Then there's James, a sporting man. You wouldn't care for him. I always  think he smells of the stable.'    'How horrid!' said Mrs. Darnell, finding her husband a little frank,  lowering her eyes as she spoke.    'Dickenson might amuse you,' Darnell went on. 'He's always got a joke. A  terrible liar, though. When he tells a tale we never know how much to  believe. He swore the other day he'd seen one of the governors buying  cockles off a barrow near London Bridge, and Jones, who's just come,  believed every word of it.'    Darnell laughed at the humorous recollection of the jest.    'And that wasn't a bad yarn about Salter's wife,' he went on. 'Salter is  the manager, you know. Dickenson lives close by, in Notting Hill, and he  said one morning that he had seen Mrs. Salter, in the Portobello Road,  in red stockings, dancing to a piano organ.'    'He's a little coarse, isn't he?' said Mrs. Darnell. 'I don't see much  fun in that.'    'Well, you know, amongst men it's different. You might like Wallis; he's  a tremendous photographer. He often shows us photos he's taken of his  children--one, a little girl of three, in her bath. I asked him how he  thought she'd like it when she was twenty-three.'    Mrs. Darnell looked down and made no answer.    There was silence for some minutes while Darnell smoked his pipe. 'I  say, Mary,' he said at length, 'what do you say to our taking a paying  guest?'    'A paying guest! I never thought of it. Where should we put him?'    'Why, I was thinking of the spare room. The plan would obviate your  objection, wouldn't it? Lots of men in the City take them, and make  money of it too. I dare say it would add ten pounds a year to our  income. Redgrave, the cashier, finds it worth his while to take a large  house on purpose. They have a regular lawn for tennis and a  billiard-room.'    Mary considered gravely, always with the dream in her eyes. 'I don't  think we could manage it, Edward,' she said; 'it would be inconvenient  in many ways.' She hesitated for a moment. 'And I don't think I should  care to have a young man in the house. It is so very small, and our  accommodation, as you know, is so limited.'    She blushed slightly, and Edward, a little disappointed as he was,  looked at her with a singular longing, as if he were a scholar  confronted with a doubtful hieroglyph, either wholly wonderful or  altogether commonplace. Next door children were playing in the garden,  playing shrilly, laughing, crying, quarrelling, racing to and fro.  Suddenly a clear, pleasant voice sounded from an upper window.    'Enid! Charles! Come up to my room at once!'    There was an instant sudden hush. The children's voices died away.    'Mrs. Parker is supposed to keep her children in great order,' said  Mary. 'Alice was telling me about it the other day. She had been talking  to Mrs. Parker's servant. I listened to her without any remark, as I  don't think it right to encourage servants' gossip; they always  exaggerate everything. And I dare say children often require to be  corrected.'    The children were struck silent as if some ghastly terror had seized  them.    Darnell fancied that he heard a queer sort of cry from the house, but  could not be quite sure. He turned to the other side, where an elderly,  ordinary man with a grey moustache was strolling up and down on the  further side of his garden. He caught Darnell's eye, and Mrs. Darnell  looking towards him at the same moment, he very politely raised his  tweed cap. Darnell was surprised to see his wife blushing fiercely.    'Sayce and I often go into the City by the same 'bus,' he said, 'and as  it happens we've sat next to each other two or three times lately. I  believe he's a traveller for a leather firm in Bermondsey. He struck me  as a pleasant man. Haven't they got rather a good-looking servant?'    'Alice has spoken to me about her--and the Sayces,' said Mrs. Darnell.  'I understand that they are not very well thought of in the  neighbourhood. But I must go in and see whether the tea is ready. Alice  will be wanting to go out directly.'    Darnell looked after his wife as she walked quickly away. He only dimly  understood, but he could see the charm of her figure, the delight of the  brown curls clustering about her neck, and he again felt that sense of  the scholar confronted by the hieroglyphic. He could not have expressed  his emotion, but he wondered whether he would ever find the key, and  something told him that before she could speak to him his own lips must  be unclosed. She had gone into the house by the back kitchen door,  leaving it open, and he heard her speaking to the girl about the water  being 'really boiling.' He was amazed, almost indignant with himself;  but the sound of the words came to his ears as strange, heart-piercing  music, tones from another, wonderful sphere. And yet he was her husband,  and they had been married nearly a year; and yet, whenever she spoke, he  had to listen to the sense of what she said, constraining himself, lest  he should believe she was a magic creature, knowing the secrets of  immeasurable delight.    He looked out through the leaves of the mulberry tree. Mr. Sayce had  disappeared from his view, but he saw the light-blue fume of the cigar  that he was smoking floating slowly across the shadowed air. He was  wondering at his wife's manner when Sayce's name was mentioned, puzzling  his head as to what could be amiss in the household of a most  respectable personage, when his wife appeared at the dining-room window  and called him in to tea. She smiled as he looked up, and he rose  hastily and walked in, wondering whether he were not a little 'queer,'  so strange were the dim emotions and the dimmer impulses that rose  within him.    Alice was all shining purple and strong scent, as she brought in the  teapot and the jug of hot water. It seemed that a visit to the kitchen  had inspired Mrs. Darnell in her turn with a novel plan for disposing of  the famous ten pounds. The range had always been a trouble to her, and  when sometimes she went into the kitchen, and found, as she said, the  fire 'roaring halfway up the chimney,' it was in vain that she reproved  the maid on the ground of extravagance and waste of coal. Alice was  ready to admit the absurdity of making up such an enormous fire merely  to bake (they called it 'roast') a bit of beef or mutton, and to boil  the potatoes and the cabbage; but she was able to show Mrs. Darnell that  the fault lay in the defective contrivance of the range, in an oven  which 'would not get hot.' Even with a chop or a steak it was almost as  bad; the heat seemed to escape up the chimney or into the room, and Mary  had spoken several times to her husband on the shocking waste of coal,  and the cheapest coal procurable was never less than eighteen shillings  the ton. Mr. Darnell had written to the landlord, a builder, who had  replied in an illiterate but offensive communication, maintaining the  excellence of the stove and charging all the faults to the account of  'your good lady,' which really implied that the Darnells kept no  servant, and that Mrs. Darnell did everything. The range, then,  remained, a standing annoyance and expense. Every morning, Alice said,  she had the greatest difficulty in getting the fire to light at all, and  once lighted it 'seemed as if it fled right up the chimney.' Only a few  nights before Mrs. Darnell had spoken seriously to her husband about it;  she had got Alice to weigh the coals expended "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25023"],[0,"The Biography of a Grizzly (#6)"],[1,"the sage-covered  river-flat sending the scared Antelope skimming like birds before him,  he was faced perchance, by some burly Range-bull, too young to be wise and  too big to be afraid, Wahb smashed his skull with one blow of that giant  paw, and served him as the Range-cow would have served himself long years  ago.        [Illustration: \"WAHB SMASHED HIS SKULL.\"]    The All-mother never fails to offer to her own, twin cups, one gall, and  one of balm. Little or much they may drink, but equally of each. The  mountain that is easy to descend must soon be climbed again. The grinding  hardship of Wahb's early days had built his mighty frame. All usual  pleasures of a grizzly's life had been denied him but _power_ bestowed in  more than double share.        [Illustration]    So he lived on year after year, unsoftened by mate or companion, sullen,  fearing nothing, ready to fight, but asking only to be let alone--quite  alone. He had but one keen pleasure in his sombre life--the lasting glory  in his matchless strength--the small but never failing thrill of joy as the  foe fell crushed and limp, or the riven boulders grit and heaved when he  turned on them the measure of his wondrous force.        [Illustration]              V      Everything has a smell of its own for those that have noses to smell. Wahb  had been learning smells all his life, and knew the meaning of most of  those in the mountains. It was as though each and every thing had a voice  of its own for him; and yet it was far better than a voice, for every one  knows that a good nose is better than eyes and ears together. And each of  these myriads of voices kept on crying, \"Here and such am I.\"    The juniper-berries, the rosehips, the strawberries, each had a soft, sweet  little voice, calling, \"Here we are--Berries, Berries.\"    The great pine woods had a loud, far-reaching voice, \"Here are we, the  Pine-trees,\" but when he got right up to them Wahb could hear the low,  sweet call of the pinon-nuts, \"Here are we, the Pinon-nuts.\"    And the quamash beds in May sang a perfect chorus when the wind was right:  \"Quamash beds, Quamash beds.\"    And when he got among them he made out each single voice. Each root had  its own little piece to say to his nose: \"Here am I, a big Quamash, rich  and ripe,\" or a tiny, sharp voice, \"Here am I, a good-for-nothing, stringy  little root.\"        [Illustration]    And the broad, rich russulas in the autumn called aloud, \"I am a fat,  wholesome Mushroom,\" and the deadly amanita cried, \"I am an Amanita. Let me  alone, or you'll be a sick Bear.\" And the fairy harebell of the canyon-banks  sang a song too, as fine as its thread-like stem, and as soft as its dainty  blue; but the warden of the smells had learned to report it not, for this,  and a million other such, were of no interest to Wahb.    So every living thing that moved, and every flower that grew, and every  rock and stone and shape on earth told out its tale and sang its little  story to his nose. Day or night, fog or bright, that great, moist nose told  him most of the things he needed to know, or passed unnoticed those of no  concern, and he depended on it more and more. If his eyes and ears together  reported so and so, he would not even then believe it until his nose said,  \"Yes; that is right.\"    But this is something that man cannot understand, for he has sold the  birthright of his nose for the privilege of living in towns.        [Illustration]    While hundreds of smells were agreeable to Wahb, thousands were indifferent  to him, a good many were unpleasant, and some actually put him in a rage.    He had often noticed that if a west wind were blowing when he was at the  head of the Piney Canyon there was an odd, new scent. Some days he did not  mind it, and some days it disgusted him; but he never followed it up. On  other days a north wind from the high Divide brought a most awful smell,  something unlike any other, a smell that he wanted only to get away from.                      *       *       *       *       *        [Illustration]    Wahb was getting well past his youth now, and he began to have pains in the  hind leg that had been wounded so often. After a cold night or a long time  of wet weather he could scarcely use that leg, and one day, while thus  crippled, the west wind came down the canyon with an odd message to his  nose. Wahb could not clearly read the message, but it seemed to say,  \"Come,\" and something within him said, \"Go.\" The smell of food will draw a  hungry creature and disgust a gorged one. We do not know why, and all that  any one can learn is that the desire springs from a need of the body. So  Wahb felt drawn by what had long disgusted him, and he slouched up the  mountain path, grumbling to himself and slapping savagely back at branches  that chanced to switch his face.        [Illustration]    The odd odor grew very strong; it led him where he had never been  before--up a bank of whitish sand to a bench of the same color, where there  was unhealthy-looking water running down, and a kind of fog coming out of a  hole. Wahb threw up his nose suspiciously--such a peculiar smell! He  climbed the bench.        [Illustration]    A snake wriggled across the sand in front. Wahb crushed it with a blow that  made the near trees shiver and sent a balanced boulder toppling down, and  he growled a growl that rumbled up the valley like distant thunder. Then he  came to the foggy hole. It was full of water that moved gently and steamed.  Wahb put in his foot, and found it was quite warm and that it felt  pleasantly on his skin. He put in both feet, and little by little went in  farther, causing the pool to overflow on all sides, till he was lying at  full length in the warm, almost hot, sulphur-spring, and sweltering in the  greenish water, while the wind drifted the steam about overhead.        [Illustration: \"CAUSING THE POOL TO OVERFLOW.\"]    There are plenty of these sulphur-springs in the Rockies, but this chanced  to be the only one on Wahb's range. He lay in it for over an hour; then,  feeling that he had had enough, he heaved his huge bulk up on the bank, and  realized that he was feeling remarkably well and supple. The stiffness of  his hind leg was gone.    He shook the water from his shaggy coat. A broad ledge in full sun-heat  invited him to stretch himself out and dry. But first he reared against the  nearest tree and left a mark that none could mistake. True, there were  plenty of signs of other animals using the sulphur-bath for their ills; but  what of it? Thenceforth that tree bore this inscription, in a language of  mud, hair, and smell, that every mountain creature could read:                         My bath. Keep away!                          (Signed) WAHB        [Illustration]    Wahb lay on his belly till his back was dry, then turned on his broad back  and squirmed about in a ponderous way till the broiling sun had wholly  dried him. He realized that he was really feeling very well now. He did  not say to himself, \"I am troubled with that unpleasant disease called  rheumatism, and sulphur-bath treatment is the thing to cure it.\" But what  he did know was, \"I have dreadful pains; I feel better when I am in this  stinking pool.\" So thenceforth he came back whenever the pains began again,  and each time he was cured.        [Illustration]        [Illustration]        [Illustration]              PART III        THE WANING        [Illustration]              I      Years went by. Wahb grew no bigger,--there was no need for that,--but he  got whiter, crosser, and more dangerous. He really had an enormous range  now. Each spring, after the winter storms had removed his notice-boards, he  went around and renewed them. It was natural to do so, for, first of all,  the scarcity of food compelled him to travel all over the range. There  were lots of clay wallows at that season, and the itching of his skin, as  the winter coat began to shed, made the dressing of cool, wet clay very  pleasant, and the exquisite pain of a good scratching was one of the finest  pleasures he knew. So, whatever his motive, the result was the same: the  signs were renewed each spring.        [Illustration]    At length the Palette Ranch outfit appeared on the Lower Piney, and the men  got acquainted with the \"ugly old fellow.\" The Cow-punchers, when they saw  him, decided they \"hadn't lost any Bears and they had better keep out of  his way and let him mind his business.\"        [Illustration]    They did not often see him, although his tracks and sign-boards were  everywhere. But the owner of this outfit, a born hunter, took a keen  interest in Wahb. He learned something of the old Bear's history from  Colonel Pickett, and found out for himself more than the colonel ever knew.    He learned that Wahb ranged as far south as the Upper Wiggins Fork and  north to the Stinking Water, and from the Meteetsee to the Shoshones.    He found that Wahb knew more about Bear-traps than most trappers do; that  he either passed them by or tore open the other end of the bait-pen and  dragged out the bait without going near the trap, and by accident or design  Wahb sometimes sprang the trap with one of the logs that formed the pen.  This ranch-owner found also that Wahb disappeared from his range each year  during the heat of the summer, as completely as he did each winter during  his sleep.        [Illustration]              II      Many years ago a wise government set aside the head waters of the  Yellowstone to be a sanctuary of wildlife forever. In the limits of this  great Wonderland the ideal of the Royal Singer was to be realized, and none  were to harm or make afraid. No violence was to be offered to any bird or  beast, no ax was to be carried into its primitive forests, and the streams  were to flow on forever unpolluted by mill or mine. All things were to  bear witness that such as this was the West before the white man came.        [Illustratio"]]]
