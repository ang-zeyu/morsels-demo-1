He stood regarding Stark from under brooding  brows, and at length he said, \"It is a wild tale. I can't believe  it--and yet, why should you lie?\"    He paused, as though hoping that Stark would answer that and relieve him  of worry.    Stark yawned. \"The tale is easily proved. Wait a day or two.\"    \"I will arm the city,\" said Rogain. \"I dare not do otherwise. But I will  tell you this.\" An astonishing unpleasant look came into his eyes. \"If  the attack does not come--if you have set a whole city by the ears for  nothing--I will have you flayed alive and your body tumbled over the  Wall for the carrion birds to feed on.\"    He strode out, taking his retinue with him. Balin smiled. \"He will do  it, too,\" he said, and dropped the bar.    Stark did not answer. He stared at Balin, and then at Thanis, and then  at the belt hanging on the peg, in a curiously blank and yet penetrating  fashion, like an animal that thinks its own thoughts. He took a deep  breath. Then, as though he found the air clean of danger, he rolled over  and went instantly to sleep.    Balin lifted his shoulders expressively. He grinned at Thanis. \"Are you  positive it's human?\"    \"He's beautiful,\" said Thanis, and tucked the cloths around him. \"Hold  your tongue.\" She continued to sit there, watching Stark's face as the  slow dreams moved across it. Balin laughed.    It was evening again when Stark awoke. He sat up, stretching lazily.  Thanis crouched by the hearthstone, stirring something savory in a  blackened pot. She wore a red kirtle and a necklet of beaten gold, and  her hair was combed out smooth and shining.    She smiled at him and rose, bringing him his own boots and trousers,  carefully cleaned, and a tunic of leather tanned fine and soft as silk.  Stark asked her where she got it.    \"Balin stole it--from the baths where the nobles go. He said you might  as well have the best.\" She laughed. \"He had a devil of a time finding  one big enough to fit you.\"    She watched with unashamed interest while he dressed. Stark said, \"Don't  burn the soup.\"    She put her tongue out at him. \"Better be proud of that fine hide while  you have it,\" she said. \"There's no sign of attack.\"    Stark was aware of sounds that had not been there before--the pacing of  men on the Wall above the house, the calling of the watch. Kushat was  armed and ready--and his time was running out. He hoped that Ciaran had  not been delayed on the moors.    Thanis said, \"I should explain about the belt. When Balin undressed you,  he saw Camar's name scratched on the inside of the boss. And, he can  open a lizard's egg without harming the shell.\"    \"What about you?\" asked Stark.    She flexed her supple fingers. \"I do well enough.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Balin came in. He had been seeking news, but there was little to be had.    \"The soldiers are grumbling about a false alarm,\" he said. \"The people  are excited, but more as though they were playing a game. Kushat has not  fought a war for centuries.\" He sighed. \"The pity of it is, Stark, I  believe your story. And I'm afraid.\"    Thanis handed him a steaming bowl. \"Here--employ your tongue with this.  Afraid, indeed! Have you forgotten the Wall? No one has carried it since  the city was built. Let them attack!\"    Stark was amused. \"For a child, you know much concerning war.\"    \"I knew enough to save your skin!\" she flared, and Balin smiled.    \"She has you there, Stark. And speaking of skins....\" He glanced up at  the belt. \"Or better, speaking of talismans, which we were not. How did  you come by it?\"    Stark told him. \"He had a sin on his soul, did Camar. And--he was my  friend.\"    Balin looked at him with deep respect. \"You were a fool,\" he said. \"Look  you. The thing is returned to Kushat. Your promise is kept. There is  nothing for you here but danger, and were I you I would not wait to be  flayed, or slain, or taken in a quarrel that is not yours.\"    \"Ah,\" said Stark softly, \"but it is mine. The Lord Ciaran made it so.\"  He, too, glanced at the belt. \"What of the talisman?\"    \"Return it where it came from,\" Thanis said. \"My brother is a better  thief than Camar. He can certainly do that.\"    \"No!\" said Balin, with surprising force. \"We will keep it, Stark and I.  Whether it has power, I do not know. But if it has--I think Kushat will  need it, and in strong hands.\"    Stark said somberly, \"It has power, the Talisman. Whether for good or  evil, I don't know.\"    They looked at him, startled. But a touch of awe seemed to repress their  curiosity.    He could not tell them. He was, somehow, reluctant to tell anyone of  that dark vision of what lay beyond the Gates of Death, which the  talisman of Ban Cruach had lent him.    Balin stood up. \"Well, for good or evil, at least the sacred relic of  Ban Cruach has come home.\" He yawned. \"I am going to bed. Will you come,  Thanis, or will you stay and quarrel with our guest?\"    \"I will stay,\" she said, \"and quarrel.\"    \"Ah, well.\" Balin sighed puckishly. \"Good night.\" He vanished into an  inner room. Stark looked at Thanis. She had a warm mouth, and her eyes  were beautiful, and full of light.    He smiled, holding out his hand.    The night wore on, and Stark lay drowsing. Thanis had opened the  curtains. Wind and moonlight swept together into the room, and she stood  leaning upon the sill, above the slumbering city. The smile that  lingered in the corners of her mouth was sad and far-away, and very  tender.    Stark stirred uneasily, making small sounds in his throat. His motions  grew violent. Thanis crossed the room and touched him.    Instantly he was awake.    \"Animal,\" she said softly. \"You dream.\"    Stark shook his head. His eyes were still clouded, though not with  sleep. \"Blood,\" he said, \"heavy in the wind.\"    \"I smell nothing but the dawn,\" she said, and laughed.    Stark rose. \"Get Balin. I'm going up on the Wall.\"    She did not know him now. \"What is it, Stark? What's wrong?\"    \"Get Balin.\" Suddenly it seemed that the room stifled him. He caught up  his cloak and Camar's belt and flung open the door, standing on the  narrow steps outside. The moonlight caught in his eyes, pale as  frost-fire.    Thanis shivered. Balin joined her without being called. He, too, had  slept but lightly. Together they followed Stark up the rough-cut stair  that led to the top of the Wall.    He looked southward, where the plain ran down from the mountains and  spread away below Kushat. Nothing moved out there. Nothing marred the  empty whiteness. But Stark said,    \"They will attack at dawn.\"          V      They waited. Some distance away a guard leaned against the parapet,  huddled in his cloak. He glanced at them incuriously. It was bitterly  cold. The wind came whistling down through the Gates of Death, and below  in the streets the watchfires shuddered and flared.    They waited, and still there was nothing.    Balin said impatiently, \"How can you know they're coming?\"    Stark shivered, a shallow rippling of the flesh that had nothing to do  with cold, and every muscle of his body came alive. Phobos plunged  downward. The moonlight dimmed and changed, and the plain was very  empty, very still.    \"They will wait for darkness. They will have an hour or so, between  moonset and dawn.\"    Thanis muttered, \"Dreams! Besides, I'm cold.\" She hesitated, and then  crept in under Balin's cloak. Stark had gone away from her. She watched  him sulkily where he leaned upon the stone. He might have been part of  it, as dark and unstirring.    Deimos sank low toward the west.    Stark turned his head, drawn inevitably to look toward the cliffs above  Kushat, soaring upward to blot out half the sky. Here, close under them,  they seemed to tower outward in a curving mass, like the last wave of  eternity rolling down, crested white with the ash of shattered worlds.    _I have stood beneath those cliffs before. I have felt them leaning down  to crush me, and I have been afraid._    He was still afraid. The mind that had poured its memories into that  crystal lens had been dead a million years, but neither time nor death  had dulled the terror that beset Ban Cruach in his journey through that  nightmare pass.    He looked into the black and narrow mouth of the Gates of Death,  cleaving the scarp like a wound, and the primitive ape-thing within him  cringed and moaned, oppressed with a sudden sense of fate.    He had come painfully across half a world, to crouch before the Gates of  Death. Some evil magic had let him see forbidden things, had linked his  mind in an unholy bond with the long-dead mind of one who had been half  a god. These evil miracles had not been for nothing. He would not be  allowed to go unscathed.    He drew himself up sharply then, and swore. He had left N'Chaka behind,  a naked boy running in a place of rocks and sun on Mercury. He had  become Eric John Stark, a man, and civilized. He thrust the senseless  premonition from him, and turned his back upon the mountains.    Deimos touched the horizon. A last gleam of reddish light tinged the  snow, and then was gone.    Thanis, who was half asleep, said with sudden irritation, \"I do not  believe in your barbarians. I'm going home.\" She thrust Balin aside and  went away, down the steps.    The plain was now in utter darkness, under the faint, far Northern  stars.    Stark settled himself against the parapet. There was a sort of timeless  patience about him. Balin envied it. He would have liked to go with  Thanis. He was cold and doubtful, but he stayed.    Time passed, endless minutes of it, lengthening into what seemed hours.    Stark said, \"Can you hear them?\"    \"No.\"    \"They come.\" His hearing, far keener than Balin's, picked up the little  sounds, the vast inchoate rustling of an army on the move in stealth and  darkness. Light-armed men, hunters, used to stalking wild beasts in the  show. They could move softly, very softly.    \"I hear nothing,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#6)"],[1,"r, Massachusetts, but he  left home at an early age to learn the machinist's trade.[33] After  serving an apprenticeship in Lowell, he moved to Boston. In the late  1830s, while employed in the instrument shop of Ari Davis, Howe is  reported to have overheard a discussion concerning the need for a  machine that would sew. In 1843, when illness kept him from his job for  days at a time, he remembered the conversation and the promises of the  rich reward that reputedly awaited the successful inventor. Determined  to invent such a machine, he finally managed to produce sufficient  results to interest George Fisher in buying a one-half interest in his  proposed invention. By April 1845, Howe's machine (fig. 14) was used to  sew all the seams of two woolen suits for men's clothing. He continued  to demonstrate his machine but found that interest was, at best,  indifferent.    Nevertheless, Howe completed a second machine (fig. 15), which he  submitted with his application for a patent. The fifth United States  patent (No. 4,750) for a sewing machine was issued to him on September  10, 1846. The machine used a grooved and curved eye-pointed needle  carried by a vibrating arm, with the needle supplied with thread from a  spool. Loops of thread from the needle were locked by a thread carried  by a shuttle, which was moved through the loop by means of  reciprocating drivers. The cloth was suspended in a vertical position,  impaled on pins projecting from a baster plate, which moved  intermittently under the needle by means of a toothed wheel. The length  of each stitching operation depended upon the length of the baster  plate, and the seams were necessarily straight. When the end of the  baster plate reached the position of the needle, the machine was  stopped. The cloth was removed from the baster plate, which was moved  back to its original position. The cloth was moved forward on the pins,  and the seam continued.    In his patent specifications, Howe claimed the following:         1. The forming of the seam by carrying a thread through the cloth       by means of a curved needle on the end of a vibrating arm, and the       passing of a shuttle furnished with its bobbin, in the manner set       forth, between the needle and the thread which it carried, under       combination and arrangement of parts substantially the same with       that described.         2. The lifting of the thread that passes through the needle-eye by       means of the lifting-rod, for the purpose of forming a loop of       loose thread that is to be subsequently drawn in by the passage of       the shuttle, as herein fully described, said lifting-rod being       furnished with a lifting pin, and governed in its motion by the       guide-pieces and other devices, arranged and operating       substantially as described.         3. The holding of the thread that is given out by the shuttle, so       as to prevent its unwinding from the shuttle-bobbin after the       shuttle has passed through the loop, said thread being held by       means of the lever or slipping-piece, as herein made known, or in       any other manner that is substantially the same in its operation       and result.         4. The manner of arranging and combining the small lever with the       sliding box, in combination with the spring-piece, for the purpose       of tightening the stitch as the needle is retracted.         5. The holding of the cloth to be sewed by the use of a       baster-plate furnished with points for that purpose, and with holes       enabling it to operate as a rack in the manner set forth, thereby       carrying the cloth forward and dispensing altogether with the       necessity of basting the parts together.    The five claims, which were allowed Howe in his patent, have been quoted  to show that he did not claim the invention of the eye-pointed needle,  for which he has so often been credited. The court judgment[34] that  upheld Howe's claim to his patented right to control the use of the  eye-pointed needle in combination with a shuttle to form a lockstitch  was mistakenly interpreted by some as verifying control of the  eye-pointed needle itself.    [Illustration: Figure 15.--HOWE'S PATENT MODEL, 1846. (Smithsonian photo  45525-B.)]    After patenting his invention, Howe spent three discouraging years in  both the United States and in England trying to interest manufacturers  in building his sewing machine, under license. Finally, for L250  sterling, he sold the British patent rights to William Thomas and  further agreed to adapt the machine to Thomas' manufacture of umbrellas  and corsets.[35] This did not prove to be a financial success for Howe  and by 1849 he was back in the United States, once again without funds.    [Illustration: Figure 16.--AN ENLARGEMENT of the stitching area.  (Smithsonian photo 45525-B.)]    On his return, Howe was surprised to find that other inventors were  engaged in the sewing-machine problem and that sewing machines were  being manufactured for sale. The sixth United States sewing-machine  patent (No. 5,942) had been issued to John A. Bradshaw on November 28,  1848, for a machine specifically stated as correcting the defects in the  E. Howe patent. Bradshaw did not purport that his machine was a new  invention. His specifications read:         The curved needle used in Howe's machine will not by itself form       the loop in the thread, which is necessary for the flying bobbin,       with its case, to pass through, and has, therefore, to be aided in       that operation by a lifting-pin, with the necessary mechanism to       operate it. This is a very bungling device, and is a great       incumbrance to the action of the machine, being an impediment in       the way of introducing the cloth to be sewed, difficult to keep       properly adjusted, and very frequently gets entangled between the       thread and the needle, by which the latter is frequently broken.       This accident happens very often, not withstanding all the       precaution which it is possible for the most careful operator to       exercise; and inasmuch as the delay occasioned thereby is very       considerable, and the needles costly and difficult to replace, it       is therefore very important that their breaking in this manner be       prevented, which in my machine is done in the most effectual manner       by dispensing with the lifting-pin altogether, the loop for the       flying bobbin to pass through being made with certainty and of the       proper form by means of my angular needle moved in a particular       manner just before the flying-bobbin case is thrown. The shuttle       and its bobbin for giving off the thread in Howe's machine are very       defective ... my neat and simple bobbin-case ... gives off its       thread with certainty and uniformity.... The baster-plate in the       Howe machine is very inconvenient and troublesome ... in my machine       ... the clamp ... is a very simple and efficient device.... The       Howe machine is stationary, and the baster-plate or cloth-holder       progressive. The Bradshaw machine is progressive and the       cloth-holder stationary.    Bradshaw's patent accurately described some of the defects of the Howe  machine, but other inventors were later to offer better solutions to the  problems.    [Illustration: Figure 17.--MOREY AND JOHNSON sewing machine, 1849.  Below: The machine is marked with the name of its maker, Safford &  Williams. The number 49 is a serial number. Missing parts have been  replaced with plastic. (Smithsonian photo 48400; brass plate: 48400-H.)]    Although the Bradshaw machine was not in current manufacture, a machine  based on it received the seventh United States sewing-machine patent.  Patent 6,099 was issued to Charles Morey and Joseph B. Johnson on  February 6, 1849. Their machine (fig. 17) was being offered for sale  even before the patent was issued.    This was the first American patent for a chainstitch machine. The stitch  was made by an eye-pointed needle carrying the thread through the  fabric; the thread was detained by a hook until the loop was enchained  by the succeeding one. The fabric was held vertically by a baster plate  in a manner similar to the Howe machine. Although not claimed in the  patent description, the Morey and Johnson machine also had a bar device  for stripping the cloth from the needle. This bar had a slight motion  causing a yielding pressure to be exerted on the cloth. Although the  patent was not granted until February 6, 1849, the application had been  filed in April of the previous year. The machine was featured in the  _Scientific American_ on January 27, 1849 (fig. 18):         Morey and Johnson Machine--These machines are very accurately       adjusted in all their parts to work in harmony, without this they       would be of no use. But they are now used in most of the Print       Works and Bleach Works in New England, and especially by the East       Boston Flour Company. It sews about one yard per minute, and we       consider it superior to the London Sewing Machine the specification       of which is in our possession. It [Morey and Johnson] is more       simple--and this is a great deal.... The price of a machine and       right to use $135.[36]    An improvement in the Morey and Johnson machine was patented by Jotham  S. Conant for which he was issued a patent on May 8, 1849. Conant's  machine offered a slight modification of the cloth bar and of the method  of keeping the cloth taut during the stitching operation. No successful  use of it is known.    A second improvement of the Morey and Johnson patent was also issued on  May 8, 1849; this United States patent (No. 6,439) was to John Bachelder  for the first continuous, but intermittent, sewing mechanism. As shown  in the patent model (fig. 19), his clothholder consisted of an endless  belt supported by and running around three or any other suitable"]]]
