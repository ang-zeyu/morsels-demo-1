Then he pushed the tree with his foot, and  it came out of the ground and fell with a loud thud.    And that is how Salar learned to heave with his body, though of course  he could not loosen so big a tree just yet.    There were many other tricks that Salar learned from his father, and I  shall tell you one of the best of them in the next chapter.          CHAPTER V    Elephants: The Tricky Trap      Salar and his father were going through the jungle, feeding from tree  to tree, and from bush to bush. One day they saw a little clear space  and in the middle of it a banana tree--just one tree. But beautiful  bunches of ripe bananas were growing on it from a large stalk.    Salar just loved bananas. In fact, all elephants do, as they cannot  get them in the jungle more than once in many months; for bananas grow  mostly in plantations kept by men. So Salar ran toward the tree  joyously.    But the wise old elephant had seen at once that the space all around  the tree was rather level and clear of bushes. That was strange in the  jungle, he thought!    Now, why did it look strange? Can _you_ tell? Why was it strange that  the space should be all flat and level, and clear of bushes? Just  think!    Because in the jungle that was not natural! In the jungle the space  should be all covered with grass and bushes, or at least with small  shrubs of different sizes, just as you have seen in fields which are  allowed to grow wild. So somebody must have _made_ the place level and  flat, and cleared away the bushes! That is what the wise old elephant  thought!    Then, also, he had seen that there was just _one_ banana tree, with no  other anywhere near it. That also seemed strange! Why? Because banana  trees always grow in groups of many dozens, whether they are in the  jungle or in a plantation.    \"Halt!\" the old elephant cried, just in time. Salar was not more than  five or six yards from the tree when he heard his father's voice. I  have told you before that, when an elephant child is told to do  anything by his Mamma or Papa, he obeys _at once_, or else he might  fall into some awful danger--just as a child in a town might get run  over by an auto or a street car.    So as soon as Salar heard his father's voice, he halted just where he  was. And that saved him, as you will see.      _The Elephant Taps Suspicious Ground with his Trunk_    His father came up to him, and looked around carefully. Then he  _tapped on the ground with the end of his trunk_.    \"An elephant must always tap with his trunk when he is coming to  suspicious ground, before he puts his foot on it,\" he said to Salar.    \"What does suspicious ground mean?\" Salar asked.    \"Ground where there might be danger, though you do not _see_ the  danger,\" his father answered.    He went on a couple of yards, tapping the ground before him all the  time. Then he suddenly stopped.    \"Gr-r-r-rump!\" he cried, \"it sounds strange and hollow!\"    Most carefully he put his foot forward and _felt_ the ground with it,  as an elephant always does when he thinks there is danger. Now the  ground _bent down_ a little just where he pressed it with his foot!    \"I thought so!\" he muttered.    Then he felt most carefully all along the _front_ edge of the open  space, first tapping it with his trunk, then pressing on it with his  foot--of course with the toe end of the foot. And all along that front  edge of the open space the ground bent down a little wherever he  pressed it with his foot.    Then he came to the _right side_ of the open space where the banana  tree grew, and tried the ground there also along the edge. And this  ground too bent down a little wherever he pressed it with his foot.    He came to the _back_ of the open space, and tried it in the same way.  And there also the ground bent down a little along the edge, wherever  he pressed it with his foot.    He came around at last to the _left side_, and tried that also. And  there again the ground bent down in the same way.    \"All four sides are suspicious!\" he cried. \"My son, this is _a most  tricky trap_!\"    And though he did not see them, a dozen men were hiding in the tops of  trees all around. They were the hunters kept by a great Prince, who  had ordered them to catch the big elephant and also the young one.    The hunters had first dug a huge pit. It was ten feet deep and  twenty-five feet wide on each side; so it was as big as a large room.  Then they had covered the top of the pit by laying many long bamboos  right across from side to side and very close to each other; so it was  just like the roof of a large room. And on the top of the bamboos they  had spread a layer of earth--just like what you have seen in flower  beds in a garden; and on that they had planted grass, to make it look  quite natural--only, they forgot that it might look natural for a  garden, but not for a wild jungle. Or perhaps they thought that an  elephant would not know any better!    And then they had gone to a plantation and fetched from there a banana  tree, with a huge bunch of ripe bananas on it. They had set up the  tree in the middle of that space; and as it would not keep straight,  they had first driven a long bamboo rod right through into the ground,  and then tied the banana tree to the top of the rod.    After doing all that, the hunters were hiding in the trees around.  They were watching to see the big elephant and the little elephant  come right up to the banana tree to eat the bananas, and get caught!  For if any elephant stepped upon that place, the top would give way  under his full weight, and he would fall right through into the pit.    But Salar's father grabbed him with his trunk, and pulled him away.    \"Come away!\" he said. \"This is a most hideous trap!\"    But Salar, who loved bananas quite as much as you love ice cream,  began to cry.    \"I want the bananas; I want them; I do, I do!\" he kept saying over and  over again.    Now his Papa was very fond of Salar, but he did not know how to reach  the bananas and not fall into the pit. He and Salar walked home  slowly.    \"I must think it over a bit,\" he said, scratching his head with a  bough.    He came there the next day with Salar, and looked all around the  place; but he could think of no safe way to get the bananas. The  hunters also came there the next day, for by this time they were quite  excited to see what the wily old elephant would do. In fact, it was  from the chief hunter of that Prince that I heard afterwards what the  elephant did do.    I must tell you here that these hunters had been watching the big  elephant for many years, and trying to catch him by different kinds of  traps; and that is how we know all about him and Salar. For when an  elephant is very big and has fine tusks, people sometimes try for ten  years to catch him, so that he may be used as the leading elephant of  a grand palace.    _Almost all the elephants you see in the zoo or in a circus were once  quite wild in the jungle_, and have been caught by some kind of trap.  They are then tamed, and finally trained to do tricks that men want  them to do. I shall tell you all about that in another book, when you  are a little older.    But now about Salar and his father. On the third day the big elephant  came there again, with Salar; and again the hunters came and hid in  the trees around. This time the big elephant looked farther into the  jungle. Then he saw the long bamboos growing in a clump--the very  clump from which the hunters had got the bamboos to make the trap. As  the elephant looked at the clump of bamboos, a thought came slowly  into his head.    He pulled out a long bamboo, and returned to the place where the trap  was. He stood just outside the trap, and thought again for some time.  Then he held one end of the bamboo in his trunk, pointed the other end  to the banana tree just where the stalk of the bunch began, and gave a  jab.    But he did not aim right, and the bamboo slipped off from the stalk.  So he tried again, and gave another jab at the stalk. In this way,  after trying many times, he managed at last to hit the stalk and break  it. Down fell the bunch of bananas to the ground.    Meanwhile Salar was jumping around his father for joy. But his father  told him to keep still. He had not succeeded in getting those bananas  yet! How could he get them out of the place of danger?    It puzzled him a long time. He poked at the bunch with the bamboo, but  that only broke off one or two of the bananas. Then he poked at the  stalk of the bunch, but the end of the bamboo slipped off it, as there  was nothing on the bamboo to grip the stalk with.    So he drew back the bamboo and looked at that end of it, to see why it  did not grip the stalk. Of course the end of the bamboo was all  smooth, and could not grip anything at all.      _Elephant Tricks the Tricky Trappers_    Then at last another thought seemed to come into the wise old  elephant's head. He put that end of the bamboo into his mouth and  began to _chew_ it; for an elephant has very strong teeth at the back  of his mouth. As his mouth was very big, that clever elephant chewed  as much of the end of the bamboo as his mouth would hold--and that was  as long as your arm. So the end of the bamboo became like fibers, that  is, like a bunch of hair, only very thick and rough.    [Illustration: Elephant Pulling Bananas out of a Tricky Trap]    Then that cunning elephant sat down on the ground and pushed the  bamboo along the ground straight before him toward the bananas. When  the hairy end of the bamboo reached the stalk of the bananas, he began  to _twist_ the other end of the bamboo with the tips of his trunk; for  _an elephant can use the tips of his trunk in the same way that you  use your fingers_.    He twisted and twisted many times, taking care to keep the hairy end  of the bamboo pressed against the stalk of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#6)"],[1,"for crusher                   3.00     0.015    1 blacksmith                              3.00     0.015    1 blacksmith helper                       2.00     0.010    1 foreman                                 5.00     0.025    2 tons coal at $3.50                      7.00     0.035  150 lbs. 40% dynamite at 15 cts.           22.50     0.113                                            ------   -------        Total                              $106.50    $0.533    The quarry face worked was 12 to 18 ft., and the stone was crushed to  2-in. size. Owing to the seamy character of the rock it was broken by  blasting into comparatively small pieces requiring very little sledging.  The stone was loaded into one-horse dump carts, the driver taking one  cart to the crusher while the other was being loaded. The haul was 100  ft. The carts were dumped into an inclined chute leading to a No. 5  Gates crusher. The stone was elevated by a bucket elevator and screened.  All stone larger than 2 ins. was returned through a chute to a No. 3  Gates crusher for recrushing. The cost given above does not include  interest, depreciation, and repairs; these items would add about $8 to  $10 more per day or 4 to 5 cts. per cubic yard.    In quarrying limestone, where the face of the quarry was only 5 to 6 ft.  high, and where the amount of stripping was small, one steam drill was  used. This drill received its steam from the same boiler that supplied  the crusher engine. The drill averaged 60 ft. of hole drilled per 10-hr.  day, but was poorly handled and frequently laid off for repairs.

The \"6 men wheeling\" delivered the  stone in wheelbarrows to the crusher platform, the run plank being never  longer than 150 ft. Two men fed the stone into the crusher, and a  bin-man helped load the wagons from the bin, and kept tally of the  loads. The stone was measured loose in the wagons, and it was found that  the average load was 1½ cu. yds., weighing 2,400 lbs. per cu. yd. There  were 40 wagon loads, or 60 cu. yds. crushed per 10-hr. day, although on  some days as high as 75 cu. yds. were crushed. The stone was screened  through a rotary screen, 9 ft. long, having three sizes of openings,  ½-in., 1¼-in. and 2¼-in. The output was 16% of the smallest size, 24% of  the middle size, and 60% of the large size. All tailings over 2½ ins. in  size were recrushed.    It will be noticed that the interest on the plant is quite an important  item. This is due to the fact that, year in and year out, a quarrying  and crushing plant seldom averages more than 100 days actually worked  per year, and the total charge for interest must be distributed over  these 100 days, and not over 300 days as is so commonly and erroneously  done. The cost of stripping the earth off the rock is often considerably  in excess of the above given cost, and each case must be estimated  separately. Quarry rental or royalty is usually not in excess of 5 cts.  per cu. yd., and frequently much less. The dynamite used was 40%, and  the cost of electric exploders is included in the cost given. Where a  higher quarry face is used the cost of drilling and the cost of  explosives per cu. yd. is less. Exclusive of quarry rent and heavy  stripping costs, a contractor should be able to quarry and crush  limestone or sandstone for not more than 75 cts. per cu. yd., or 62 cts.  per ton of 2,000 lbs., wages and conditions being as above given.    The labor cost of erecting bins and installing a 9×16 jaw crusher,  elevator, etc., averages about $75, including hauling the plant two or  three miles, and dismantling the plant when work is finished.    The following is a record of the cost of crushing stone and cobbles on  four jobs at Newton, Mass., in 1891. On jobs A and B the stone was  quarried and crushed; on jobs C and D cobblestones were crushed. A  9×15-in. Farrel-Marsondon crusher was used, stone being fed in by two  laborers. A rotary screen having ½, 1 and 2½-in. openings delivered the  stone into bins having four compartments, the last receiving the  \"tailings\" which had failed to pass through the screen. The broken stone  was measured in carts as they left the bin, but several cart loads were  weighed, giving the following weights per cubic foot of broken stone:                                   -----------Size.--------------                                   ½-in.  1-in. 2½-ins.

The gravel is shoveled against a portable inclined  screen through which the sand drops while the pebbles slide down and  accumulate at the bottom. The cost of screening by hand is the cost of  shoveling the gravel against the screen divided by the number of cubic  yards of saved material. In screening gravel for sand the richer the  gravel is in fine material the cheaper will be the cost per cubic yard  for screening; on the contrary in screening gravel for the pebbles the  less sand there is in the gravel the cheaper will be the cost per cubic  yard for"]]]
