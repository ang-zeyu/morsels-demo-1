Had the cannon been directed  vertically upwards, then the projectile, leaving the muzzle with the  same initial velocity as before, would soar up and up, with gradually  abating speed, until at last it reached a turning-point, the elevation  of which would depend upon the initial velocity. Poised for a moment  at the summit, the cannon-ball may then be likened to the  clock-weight, for the entire energy which it possessed by its motion  has been transformed into the statical energy of a raised weight. Thus  we see these two forms of energy are mutually interchangeable. The  raised weight if allowed to fall will acquire velocity, or the rapidly  moving weight if directed upwards will acquire altitude.    The quantity of energy which can be conveyed by a rapidly moving body  increases greatly with its speed. For instance, if the speed of the  body be doubled, the energy will be increased fourfold, or, in  general, the energy which a moving body possesses may be said to be  proportional to the square of its speed. Here then we have another  source of the energy present in our earth-moon system; for the moon is  hurrying along in its path with a speed of two-thirds of a mile per  second, or about twice or three times the speed of a cannon-shot.  Hence the fact that the moon is continuously revolving in a circle  shows us that it possesses a store of energy which is nine times as  great as that which a cannon-ball as massive as the moon, and fired  with the ordinary velocity, would receive from the powder which  discharged it.    Thus we see that the moon is endowed with two sources of energy, one  of which is due to its separation from the earth, and the other to the  speed of its motion. Though these are distinct, they are connected  together by a link which it is important for us to comprehend. The  speed with which the moon revolves around the earth is connected with  the moon's distance from the earth. The moon might, for instance,  revolve in a larger circle than that which it actually pursues; but  if it did so, the speed of its motion would have to be appropriately  lessened. The orbit of the moon might have a much smaller radius than  it has at present, provided that the speed was sufficiently increased  to compensate for the increased attraction which the earth would  exercise at the lessened distance. Indeed, I am here only stating what  every one is familiar with under the form of Kepler's Law, that the  square of the periodic time is in proportion to the cube of the mean  distance. To each distance of the moon therefore belongs an  appropriate speed. The energy due to the moon's position and the  energy due to its motion are therefore connected together. One of  these quantities cannot be altered without the other undergoing  change. If the moon's orbit were increased there would be a gain of  energy due to the enlarged distance, and a loss of energy due to the  diminished speed. These would not, however, exactly compensate. On the  whole, we may represent the total energy of the moon as a single  quantity, which increases when the distance of the moon from the earth  increases, and lessens when the distance from the earth to the moon  lessens. For simplicity we may speak of this as moon-energy.    But the most important constituent of the store of energy in the  earth-moon system is that contributed by the earth itself. I do not  now speak of the energy due to the velocity of the earth in its orbit  round the sun. The moon indeed participates in this equally with the  earth, but it does not affect those mutual actions between the earth  and moon with which we are at present concerned. We are, in fact,  discussing the action of that piece of machinery the earth-moon  system; and its action is not affected by the circumstance that the  entire machine is being bodily transported around the sun in a great  annual voyage. This has little more to do with the action of our  present argument than has the fact that a man is walking about to do  with the motions of the works of the watch in his pocket. We shall,  however, have to allude to this subject further on.    The energy of the earth which is significant in the earth-moon theory  is due to the earth's rotation upon its axis. We may here again use as  an illustration the action of machinery; and the special contrivance  that I now refer to is the punching-engine that is used in our  ship-building works. In preparing a plate of iron to be riveted to the  side of a ship, a number of holes have to be made all round the margin  of the plate. These holes must be half an inch or more in diameter,  and the plate is sometimes as much as, or more than, half an inch in  thickness. The holes are produced in the metal by forcing a steel  punch through it; and this is accomplished without even heating the  plate so as to soften the iron. It is needless to say that an intense  force must be applied to the punch. On the other hand, the distance  through which the punch has to be moved is comparatively small. The  punch is attached to the end of a powerful lever, the other end of the  lever is raised by a cam, so as to depress the punch to do its work.  An essential part of the machine is a small but heavy fly-wheel  connected by gearing with the cam.    This fly-wheel when rapidly revolving contains within it, in virtue of  its motion, a large store of energy which has gradually accumulated  during the time that the punch is not actually in action. The energy  is no doubt originally supplied from a steam-engine. What we are  especially concerned with is the action of the rapidly rotating wheel  as a reservoir in which a large store of energy can be conveniently  maintained until such time as it is wanted. In the action of punching,  when the steel die comes down upon the surface of the plate, a large  quantity of energy is suddenly demanded to force the punch against the  intense resistance it experiences; the energy for this purpose is  drawn from the store in the fly-wheel, which experiences no doubt a  check in its velocity, to be regained again from the energy of the  engine during the interval which elapses before the punch is called on  to make the next hole.    Another illustration of the fly-wheel on a splendid scale is seen in  our mighty steel works, where ponderous rails are being manufactured.  A white-hot ingot of steel is presented to a pair of powerful rollers,  which grip the steel, and send it through at the other side both  compressed and elongated. Tremendous power is required to meet the  sudden demand on the machine at the critical moment. To obtain this  power an engine of stupendous proportions is sometimes attached  directly to the rollers, but more frequently an engine of rather less  horse-power will be used, the might of this engine being applied to  giving rapid rotation to an immense fly-wheel, which may thus be  regarded as a reservoir full of energy. The rolling mills then obtain  from this store in the fly-wheel whatever energy is necessary for  their gigantic task.    These illustrations will suffice to show how a rapidly rotating body  may contain energy in virtue of its rotation, just as a cannon-ball  contains energy in virtue of its speed of translation, or as a  clock-weight has energy in virtue of the fact that it has some  distance to fall before it reaches the earth. The rotating body need  not necessarily have the shape of a wheel--it may be globular in form;  nor need the axes of rotation be fixed in bearings, like those of the  fly-wheel; nor of course is there any limit to the dimensions which  the rotating body may assume. Our earth is, in fact, a vast rotating  body 8000 miles in diameter, and turning round upon its axis once  every twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes. Viewed in this way,  the earth is to be regarded as a gigantic fly-wheel containing a  quantity of energy great in correspondence with the earth's mass. The  amount of energy which can be stored by rotation also depends upon the  square of the velocity with which the body turns round; thus if our  earth turned round in half the time which it does at present, that is,  if the day was twelve hours instead of twenty-four hours, the energy  contained in virtue of that rotation would be four times its present  amount.    Reverting now to the earth-moon system, the energy which that system  contains consists essentially of two parts--the moon-energy, whose  composite character I have already explained, and the earth-energy,  which has its origin solely in the rotation of the earth on its axis.  It is necessary to observe that these are essentially distinct--there  is no necessary relation between the speed of the earth's rotation and  the distance of the moon, such as there is between the distance of the  moon and the speed with which it revolves in its orbit.    For completeness, it ought to be added that there is also some energy  due to the moon's rotation on its axis, but this is very small for  two reasons: first, because the moon is small compared with the  earth, and second, because the angular velocity of the moon is also  very small compared with that of the earth. We may therefore dismiss  as insignificant the contributions from this source of energy to the  sum total.    I have frequently used illustrations derived from machinery, but I  want now to emphasize the profound distinction that exists between the  rotation of the earth and the rotation of a fly-wheel in a machine  shop. They are both, no doubt, energy-holders, but it must be borne in  mind, that as the fly-wheel doles out its energy to supply the wants  of the machines with which it is connected, a restitution of its store  is continually going on by the action of the engine, so that on the  whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24263"],[0,"A Hundred Anecdotes of Animals (#6)"],[1,"ts. The keeper fancied he  saw his long-lost elephant in a group that was before them. He was  determined to go up to it; nor could the strongest representations of the  danger dissuade him from his purpose. When he approached the creature, she  knew him, and giving him three salutes, by waving her trunk in the air,  knelt down and received him on her back. She afterwards assisted in  securing the other elephants, and likewise brought her three young ones.  The keeper recovered his character; and, as a recompense for his  sufferings and intrepidity, had an annuity settled on him for life. This  elephant was afterwards in the possession of Governor Hastings.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XL.    Ostrich Riding.        A gentleman tells how, during the time of his residence at Podor, a French  factory on the banks of the river Niger, there were two ostriches, though  young, of gigantic size, which afforded him a very remarkable sight. \"They  were,\" he says, \"so tame, that two little blacks mounted both together on  the back of the largest. No sooner did he feel their weight, than he began  to run as fast as possible, and carried them several times round the  village, as it was impossible to stop him otherwise than by obstructing  the passage. This sight pleased me so much, that I wished it to be  repeated, and to try their strength, directed a full-grown negro to mount  the smallest, and two others the largest. This burthen did not seem at all  disproportionate to their strength. At first they went at a tolerably  sharp trot, but when they became heated a little, they expanded their  wings as though to catch the wind, and moved with such fleetness, that  they scarcely seemed to touch the ground. Most people have, at one time or  another, seen a partridge run; and consequently know that there is no man  whatever able to keep up with it; and it is easy to imagine, that if this  bird had a longer step, its speed would be considerably augmented. The  ostrich moves like the partridge, with this advantage; and I am satisfied  that those I am speaking of would have distanced the fleetest racehorses  that were ever bred in England. It is true they would not hold out so long  as a horse; but they would undoubtedly go over a given space in less time.  I have frequently beheld this sight, which is capable of giving one an  idea of the prodigious strength of an ostrich, and of showing what use it  might be of, had we but the method of breaking and managing it as we do a  horse.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLI.    A Choice Retaliation.      A tame elephant kept by a merchant was suffered to go at large. The animal  used to walk about the streets in as quiet and familiar a manner as any of  the inhabitants, and delighted much in visiting the shops, particularly  those which sold herbs and fruit, where he was well received, except by a  couple of brutal cobblers, who, without any cause, took offence at the  generous creature, and once or twice attempted to wound his proboscis with  their awls. The noble animal, who knew it was beneath him to crush them,  did not disdain to chastise them by other means. He filled his large trunk  with a considerable quantity of water, not of the cleanest quality, and  advancing to them as usual, covered them at once with a dirty flood. The  fools were laughed at, and the punishment applauded.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLII.    The Horse and Greyhound.      Various have been the opinions upon the difference of speed between a  well-bred greyhound and a racehorse if opposed to each other. Wishes had  been frequently indulged by the sporting world that some criterion could  be adopted by which the superiority of speed could be fairly ascertained,  when the following circumstance accidentally took place, and afforded some  information upon what had been previously considered a matter of great  uncertainty. In the month of December 1800 a match was to have been run  over Doncaster racecourse for one hundred guineas, but one of the horses  having been withdrawn, a mare started alone, that by running the ground  she might ensure the wager; when having run about one mile in the four,  she was accompanied by a greyhound, which joined her from the side of the  course, and emulatively entering into the competition, continued to race  with the mare for the other three miles, keeping nearly head and head, and  affording an excellent treat to the field by the energetic exertions of  each. At passing the distance post five to four was betted in favour of  the greyhound, when parallel with the stand it was even betting, and any  person might have taken his choice from five to ten; the mare, however,  had the advantage by a head at the termination of the course.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLIII.    The Goat.      A gentleman who had taken an active share in the rebellion of 1715, after  the battle of Preston escaped into the West Highlands, where a lady, a  near relative, afforded him an asylum. A faithful servant conducted him to  the mouth of a cave, and furnished him with an abundant store of  provisions. The fugitive crept in at a low aperture, dragging his stores  along. When he reached a wider and loftier expanse he found some obstacle  before him. He drew his dirk, but unwilling to strike, lest he might take  the life of a companion in seclusion, he stooped down, and discovered a  goat with her kid stretched on the ground. He soon perceived that the  animal was in great pain, and feeling her body and limbs, ascertained that  her leg was fractured. He bound it up with his garter, and offered her a  share of the bread beside him; but she stretched out her tongue, as if to  apprise him that her mouth was parched with thirst. He gave her water,  which she took readily, and then ate some bread. After midnight he  ventured out of the cave: all was still. He plucked an armful of grass and  cut tender twigs, which the goat accepted with manifestations of joy and  thankfulness. The prisoner derived much comfort in having a living  creature in this dungeon, and he caressed and fed her tenderly. The man  who was entrusted to bring him supplies fell sick; and when another  attempted to penetrate into the cavern the goat furiously opposed him,  presenting her horns in all directions, till the fugitive, hearing a  disturbance, came forward. This new attendant giving the watchword removed  every doubt of his good intentions, and the amazon of the recess obeyed  her benefactor in permitting him to advance. The gentleman was convinced  that had a band of military attacked the cavern, his grateful patient  would have died in his defence.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLIV.    A Mother Watching her Young.      The following singular instance of the far-sighted watchfulness of the  turkey-hen over her young is narrated by a French priest. \"I have heard,\"  he says, \"a turkey-hen, when at the head of her brood, send forth the most  hideous scream, without being able to perceive the cause; her young ones,  however, immediately when the warning was given skulked under the bushes,  the grass, or whatever else seemed to offer shelter or protection. They  even stretched themselves at full length on the ground, and continued  motionless as if dead. In the meantime the mother, with her eyes directed  upwards, continued her cries and screaming as before. On looking up in the  direction in which she seemed to gaze I discovered a black spot just under  the clouds, but was unable at first to determine what it was; however, it  soon appeared to be a bird of prey, though at first at too great a  distance to be distinguished. I have seen one of those animals continue in  this agitated state, and her whole brood pinned down, as it were, to the  ground for four hours together, whilst their formidable foe has taken its  circuits, has mounted and hovered directly over their heads; at last upon  his disappearing the parent changed her note and sent forth another cry,  which in an instant gave life to the whole trembling tribe, and they all  flocked round her with expressions of pleasure, as if conscious of their  happy escape from danger.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLV.    Concerts of Animals.      An abbot, a man of wit, and skilled in the construction of new musical  instruments, was ordered by Louis XI., King of France, more in jest than  in earnest, to procure him a concert of swines' voices. The abbot said  that the thing could doubtless be done, but that it would take a good deal  of money. The king ordered that he should have whatever he required for  the purpose. The abbot then wrought a thing as singular as ever was seen;  for out of a great number of hogs of several ages which he got together,  and placed under a tent, or pavilion, covered with velvet, before which he  had a table of wood painted, with a certain number of keys, he made an  organical instrument, and as he played upon the said keys with little  spikes, which pricked the hogs, he made them cry in such order and  consonance, he highly delighted the king and all his company.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLVI.    Travellers.      An innkeeper once sent, as a present by the carrier, to a friend a dog and  cat tied up in a bag, who had been companions more than ten months. A  short time after the dog and cat took their departure together and  returned to their old habitation, a distance of thirteen miles. They  jogged along the road side by side, and on one occasion the dog gallantly  defended his fellow-traveller from the attack of another dog they met.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XLVII.
