KITTIWAKE. _Rissa tridactyla trydactyla._    Range.--North Atlantic and Arctic regions, breeding from the Gulf of the  St. Lawrence northward and wintering south to the Great Lakes and Long  Island.    The Kittiwake is sixteen inches in length, has a pearly gray mantle,  black tips to the primaries, and remainder of plumage white. Its hind  toe is very small being apparently wanting in the eastern form, while in  the Pacific it is more developed. These are very noisy Gulls, their  notes resembling a repetition of their name. They are very common in the  far north, placing nests on the ledges of high rocky cliffs, often in  company with Murres and Auks. They gather together a pile of sticks,  grass and moss, making the interior cup-shaped so as to hold their two  or three eggs. Large numbers of them breed on Bird Rock, they occupying  certain ledges while the Gannets and Murres, which also breed there,  also have distinct ledges on which to make their homes. The breeding  season is at its height during June. The eggs are buffy or brownish gray  and are spotted with different shades of brown. Size 2.25 x 1.60.  Data.--So. Labrador, June 15, 1884. Three eggs. Nest made of seaweed and  moss, placed on ledge of cliff. Many Murres nesting on other ledges.    [Illustration 041: Ivory Gull. Kittiwake.]  [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 40    40a. PACIFIC KITTIWAKE. _Rissa tridactyla pollicaris._    Range.--Coast of the North Pacific, wintering south to California.    The Pacific Kittiwake breeds in immense rookeries on some of the islands  in Bering Sea. They are well distributed over Copper Island where they  nest in June and July, choosing the high ledges which overhang the sea.  The nesting habits and eggs are precisely the same as those of the  common Kittiwake.      41. RED-LEGGED KITTIWAKE. _Rissa brevirostris._    Range.--Northwestern coasts, breeding in high latitudes.    This Kittiwake is similar to the preceding, with the exception that the  legs are bright red, the mantle is darker, and the bill is shorter. This  species was found by Dr. Leonard Stejneger to be a very abundant nesting  bird on islands in Bering Sea, selecting steep and inaccessible rocks  and ledges on which to build its nest. Their nesting habits are  precisely the same as the Pacific Kittiwake, but they most often nest in  separate colonies, but can be distinguished readily when nesting  together by the darker mantles when on the nest and the red legs when  flying. Grass, moss and mud are used in the nest. The ground color of  the eggs is buffy or brownish, and the spots are dark brown and lilac.  Size 2.15 x 1.50.      42. GLAUCOUS GULL. _Larus hyperboreus._    Range.--Arctic regions, south in winter to Long Island, the Great Lakes,  and San Francisco Bay.    This Gull shares with the Great Black-backed Gull the honor of being the  largest of the Gulls, being 28 inches in length. Mantle light gray; it  is distinguished by its size and the primaries, which are white to the  tips. A powerful bird that preys upon the smaller Gulls and also devours  the young and eggs of smaller birds.    They nest on the ground on the islands and shores of Hudson Bay,  Greenland, etc. The nest is made of seaweed, grass and moss and is  generally quite bulky. The two or three eggs are laid in June. They are  of various shades of color from a light drab to a brownish, and are  spotted with brownish and black. Size about 3.00 x 2.20.    [Illustration 042: Brownish buff.]  [Illustration: Red-legged Kittiwake. Glaucous Gull.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 41    42.1. POINT BARROW GULL. _Larus barrovianus._    Range.--Northwest coast from Bering Sea to Point Barrow.    This species is almost identical with the Glaucus Gull, averaging  perhaps a trifle smaller. Its standing as a distinct species is still  questioned and has not yet been decided satisfactorily. Early in June  their nests are built on remote islands in Bering Sea. These nests are  the same as the last species, large piles of vegetation, hollowed on top  for the reception of the eggs. The eggs have the same variations in  color and markings as the Glaucus Gull. Size 3.00 x 2.10.  Data.--Herschel Is., Alaska, July 1, 1900. Nest made of seaweed and  grass; placed on the ground. Three eggs. Collector, Rev. I. O. Stringer.      43. ICELAND GULL. _Larus leucopterus._    Range.--Arctic regions, south in winter to the Middle States.    This Gull in appearance is precisely like the two preceding ones but is  considerably smaller; 24 inches in length. A very common bird in the  north, breeding in colonies of thousands on many of the islands. It is  regarded as one of the most common of the larger Gulls in Bering Sea and  also nests commonly in Hudson Bay and Greenland, as well as in the  Eastern Hemisphere. They nest indifferently on high rocky cliffs or on  low sandy islands. Except when the eggs are laid in a sandy depression  in the soil, quite bulky nests are made of seaweed and moss. The eggs  are laid about the first of June; they number two to three and have a  ground color of brownish or greenish brown and are blotched with umber.  Size 2.80 x 1.83. Data.--Mackenzie Bay, Arctic America. June 18, 1899.  Nest made of seaweed and grass on an island in the bay.    [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: Greenish brown.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 42    44. GLAUCOUS-WINGED GULL. _Larus glaucescens_.    Range.--North Pacific coast, breeding from British Columbia northwards  and wintering from the same country to southern California.    This Gull is very like the preceding except that the primaries are the  same color as the mantle, and are tipped with white. Length about 27  inches. Not so northerly distributed a bird as the previous ones, and  consequently better known. They breed in large numbers both on the high  rocky cliffs of the islands along the coast and on the low sandy islands  of the Aleutian Chain. On Copper Island they breed on the inaccessible  cliffs overhanging the water. As in the case of the Iceland Gull, when  the nests are on the cliffs, a large nest of seaweed is made, whereas if  they are on the ground, especially in sandy places no attempt is made at  nest-building. The eggs have a greenish brown ground color and dark  brown spots. Size 2.75 x 2.05. Data.--West Coast of Vancouver Island.  June 20, 1896. Three eggs; nest made of seaweed. Located on a low ledge.  Collector, Dr. Newcombe.      45. KUMLIEN'S GULL. _Larus Kumlieni_.    Range.--North Atlantic coast, breeding in Cumberland Sound and wintering  as far south as Long Island.    This bird differs from the Glaucous-winged only in the pattern of the  gray markings of the primaries and in having a little lighter mantle. It  is quite common in its breeding haunts where it places its nest high up  on the ledges of the cliffs. The eggs are not different apparently from  glaucescens.      46. NELSON'S GULL. _Larus nelsoni_.    Range.--Coast of Alaska.    Plumage exactly like that of Kumlien Gull and questionably a new  species. The nests and eggs are not to be distinguished from the  preceding.    [Illustration 044: Iceland Gull. Glaucous-winged Gull.]  [Illustration: Pale greenish brown.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 43    47. GREAT BLACK-BACKED GULL. _Larus marinus_.    Range.--North Atlantic on both the American and European sides; breeds  from Nova Scotia northward and winters south to the Great Lakes and the  Middle States.    The largest of the Gulls (thirty inches long) and unlike any other. The  mantle is dark slaty black, and the primaries are black with white tips.  The bill is very large and powerful and quite strongly hooked. They are  quite abundant birds in their range, and are very quarrelsome, both  among themselves and other species. They do not breed in as large  colonies as do the other Gulls, half a dozen pairs appropriating a small  island to the exclusion of all other birds. They are very rapacious  birds and live to a great extent, especially during the breeding season,  upon the eggs and young of other birds such as Ducks, Murres and smaller  Gulls. They place their nests upon the higher portions of sandy islands.  They are made of grasses and seaweed. The three eggs are laid early in  June; they are grayish or brownish, spotted with brown and lilac. Size  3.00 x 2.15. Data.--South Labrador, June 21, 1884. Three eggs. Nest on a  small island off the coast; of grasses and moss.      48. SLATY-BACKED GULL.--_Larus schistisagus_.    Range.--North Pacific and Arctic Oceans.    This Gull, which is similar to the Great Black-backed, but is smaller  and has a lighter mantle, does not breed in any considerable numbers on  the American side of the Pacific. It nests in June on some of the  islands in Bering Sea and probably more commonly farther north. They  often nest in company with other species, placing their small mounds of  seaweed on the ground on the higher parts of the islands. The full set  contains three eggs of grayish or brownish color, spotted with dark  brown or black. Size 2.90 x 2.00. Data.--Harrowby Bay, N. W. T. Canada,  June 11, 1901. Nest of grass, roots and mud and lined with dry grass; on  point making into the bay. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.    [Illustration 045: Great Black-Backed Gull. Kumlien's Gull.]  [Illustration: Grayish buff.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 44    49. WESTERN GULL. _Larus occidentalis._    Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from southern California to British  Columbia.    This bird, which is the most southerly distributed of the larger Gulls  is twenty-four inches in length. Mantle slate colored; primaries black,  both these and the secondaries being broadly tipped with white. These  Gulls nest abundantly on the Farallones, the majority of them showing a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30001"],[0,"On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass (#6)"],[1,"appeared to resemble internally a    celestial globe in which figures of the sun, moon, and    other planets formed with the greatest skill moved, being    impelled by weights and wheels, so that performing their    course in certain and fixed intervals they pointed out the    hour night and day with infallible certainty; also the    twelve signs of the zodiac with certain appropriate    characters, moved with the firmament, contained within    themselves the course of the planets.    [Illustration: Figure 10.--CALENDRICAL GEARING DESIGNED BY AL-BIRUNI,  _ca._ A.D. 1000. The gear train count is 40-10+7-59+19-59+24-48. The  gear of 48 therefore makes 19 (annual) rotations while that of 19-59  shows 118 double lunations of 29+30=59 days. The gear of 40 shows a  (lunar) rotation in exactly 28 days, and the center pinions 7+10 rotate  in exactly one week. After Wiedemann (see footnote 20).]    The phrase \"resembled internally\" is of especial interest in this  passage; it may perhaps arise as a mistranslation of the technical term  for stereographic projection of the sphere, and if so the device might  have been an anaphoric clock or some other astrolabic device.    This is made more probable by the existence of a specifically Islamic  concentration on the astrolabe, and on its planetary companion  instrument, the equatorium, as devices for mechanizing computation by  use of geometrical analogues. The ordinary planispheric astrolabe, of  course, was known in Islam from its first days until almost the present  time. From the time of al-Biruni (_ca._ 1000)--significantly, perhaps,  he is well known for his travel account of India--there is remarkable  innovation.    Most cogent to our purpose is a text, described for the first time by  Wiedemann,[20] in which al-Biruni explains how a special train of  gearing may be used to show the revolutions of the sun and moon at their  relative rates and to demonstrate the changing phase of the moon,  features of fundamental importance in the Islamic (lunar) calendrical  system. This device necessarily uses gear wheels with an odd number of  teeth (_e.g._, 7, 19, 59) as dictated by the astronomical constants  involved (see fig. 10). The teeth are shaped like equilateral triangles  and square shanks are used, exactly as with the Antikythera machine.  Horse-headed wedges are used for fixing; a tradition borrowed from the  horse-shaped _Far[=a]s_ used to fasten the traditional astrolabe. Of  special interest for us is the lunar phase diagram, which is just the  same in form and structure as the lunar volvelle that occurs later in  horology and is still so commonly found today, especially as a  decoration for the dial of grandfather clocks.    [Illustration: Figure 11.--GEARED ASTROLABE BY MU[H.]AMMAD B. AB[=I] BAKR  OF ISFAHAN, A.D. 1221-1222. (_Photo courtesy of Science Museum,  London._)]    Biruni's calendrical machine is the earliest complicated geared device  on record and it is therefore all the more significant that it carries a  feature found in later clocks. From the manuscript description alone one  could not tell whether it was designed for automatic action or merely to  be turned by hand. Fortunately this point is made clear by the most  happy survival of an intact specimen of this very device, without doubt  the oldest geared machine in existence in a complete state.    [Illustration: Figure 12.--GEARING FROM ASTROLABE SHOWN IN FIGURE 11.  The gear train count is as follows: 48-13+8-64+64-64+10-60. The pinion  of 8 has been incorrectly replaced by a more modern pinion of 10. The  gear of 48 should make 13 (lunar) rotations while the double gear of  64+64 makes 6 revolutions of double months (of 29-30 days) and the gear  of 60 makes a single turn in the hegiral year of 354 days. (_Photo  courtesy of Science Museum, London._)]    This landmark in the history of science and technology is now preserved  at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, England.[21] It is an  astrolabe, dated 1221-22 and signed by the maker, Mu[h.]ammad b. Ab[=i]  Bakr (died 1231-32) of Isfahan, Persia (see figs. 11 and 12). The very  close resemblance to the design of Biruni is quite apparent, though the  gearing has been simplified very cleverly so that only one wheel has an  odd number of teeth (13), the rest being much easier to mark out  geometrically (_e.g._, 10, 48, 60, and 64 teeth). The lunar phase  volvelle can be seen through the circular opening at the back of the  astrolabe. It is quite certain that no automatic action is intended;  when the central pivot is turned, by hand, probably by using the  astrolabe rete as a \"handle,\" the calendrical circles and the lunar  phase are moved accordingly. Using one turn for a day would be too slow  for useful re-setting of the instrument, in practice a turn corresponds  more nearly to an interval of one week.    [Illustration: Figure 13.--ASTROLABE CLOCK, REGULATED BY A MERCURY DRUM,  from the Alfonsine _Libros del saber_ (see footnote 22).]    In addition to this geared development of the astrolabe, the same period  in Islam brought forth a new device, the equatorium, a mechanical model  designed to simulate the geometrical constructions used for finding the  positions of the planets in Ptolemaic astronomy. The method may have  originated already in classical times, a simple device being described  by Proclus Diadochus (_ca._ 450), but the first general, though crude,  planetary equatorium seems to have been described by Abulcacim Abnacahm  (_ca._ 1025) in Granada; it has been handed down to us in the archaic  Castilian of the Alfonsine _Libros del saber_.[22] The sections of this  book, dealing with the _Laminas de las VII Planetas_, describe not only  this instrument but also the improved modification introduced by  Azarchiel (born _ca._ 1029, died _ca._ 1087).    No Islamic examples of the equatorium have survived, but from this  period onward, there appears to have been a long and active tradition of  them, and ultimately they were transmitted to the West, along with the  rest of the Alfonsine corpus. More important for our argument is that  they were the basis for the mechanized astronomical models of Richard of  Wallingford (_ca._ 1320) and probably others, and for the already  mentioned great astronomical clock of de Dondi. In fact, the complicated  gearwork and dials of de Dondi's clock constitute a series of equatoria,  mechanized in just the same way as the calendrical device described by  Biruni.    It is evident that we are coming nearer now to the beginning of the true  mechanical clock, and our last step, also from the Alfonsine corpus of  western Islam, provides us with an important link between the anaphoric  clock, the weight drive, and a most curious perpetual-motion device, the  mercury wheel, used as an escapement or regulator. The Alfonsine book on  clocks contains descriptions of five devices in all, four of them being  due to Isaac b. Sid (two sundials, an automaton water-clock and the  present mercury clock) and one to Samuel ha-Levi Adulafia (a candle  clock)--they were probably composed just before _ca._ 1276-77.    [Illustration: Figure 14.--ISLAMIC PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL, after  manuscript cited by Schmeller (see footnote 26).]    The mercury clock of Isaac b. Sid consists of an astrolabe dial, rotated  as in the anaphoric clock, and fitted with 30 leaf-shaped gear teeth  (see fig. 13). These are driven by a pinion of 6 leaves mounted on a  horizontal axle (shown very diagrammatically in the illustration) and at  the other end of this axle is a wheel on which is mounted the special  mercury drum which is powered by a normal weight drive.    It is the mercury drum which forms the most novel feature of this  device; the fluid, constrained in 12 chambers so as to just fill 6 of  them, must slowly filter through small holes in the constraining walls.  In practice, of course, the top mercury surfaces will not be level, but  higher on the right so as to balance dynamically the moment of the  applied weight on its driven rope. This curious arrangement shows point  of resemblance to the Indian \"mercury-holes,\" to the perpetual-motion  devices found in the medieval European tradition and also in the texts  associated with Ri[d.]w[=a]n, which we shall next examine.    [Illustration: Figure 15.--ANOTHER PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL, after the  text cited in figure 14.]    It is of the greatest interest to our theme that the Islamic  contributions to horology and perpetual motion seem to form a closely  knit corpus. A most important series of horological texts, including  those of Ri[d.]w[=a]n and al-Jazar[=i], have been edited by Wiedemann  and Hauser.[23] Other Islamic texts give versions of the water clocks  and automata of Archimedes and of Hero and Philo of Alexandria.[24] In  at least three cases[25] these texts are found also associated with  texts describing perpetual-motion wheels and other hydraulic devices.  Three manuscripts of this type have been published in German translation  by Schmeller.[26] The devices include a many chambered wheel (see fig.  14) similar to the Alfonsine mercury \"escapement,\" a wheel of slanting  tubes constructed like the noria (see fig. 15), wheels of weights  swinging on arms as described by Villard of Honnecourt, and a remarkable  device which seems to be the earliest known example of a weight drive.  This latter machine is a pump, in which a chain of buckets is used to  raise water by passing over a pulley which is geared to a drum powered  by a falling weight (see fig. 16); perhaps for balance, the whole  arrangement is made in duplicate with common axles for the corresponding  parts.    [Illustration: Figure 16.--ISLAMIC PUMP POWERED BY A WEIGHT DRIVE,  after the text cited in figure 14.]    The Islamic tradition of water clocks did not involve the use of gears,  though very occasionally a pair is used to turn power through an angle  when this is dictated by the use of a water wheel "]]]
