Almsgiving stands high among virtues in the estimation  of both Hindus and Muhammadans; it is considered sufficient to atone for  many sins, and it is practised so indiscriminately as to pauperize many  who could provide for themselves. It is unfit that Christianity should  seem less careful of those who are really poor and helpless than  Hinduism and Muhammadanism are. Work such as I saw in Mr. Smith's chapel  is carried on in some places down to the present time.    A short time after our arrival at Raj Ghat my dear friend the Rev. W. P.  Lyon appeared, and took me in his conveyance by a road skirting the city  to the Mission House in Secrole, which he then occupied. From Mr. and  Mrs. Lyon, both of whom I had known intimately for years in our own  land, I received a hearty welcome.    At the corner of the mission compound, facing the public road, was the  humble chapel, built of sun-dried bricks, in which service was conducted  in the native language. I arrived half an hour before the time for the  afternoon service. Before its commencement I had the pleasure of meeting  Messrs. Buyers and Shurman, with whom I was to be for years associated  in mission work. With them I went to the service, which was conducted by  Mr. Shurman. There were at that time only two or three native Christians  connected with the mission, and these, with their families, the  missionaries and their wives, and a few orphan children, constituted the  congregation. I had just enough of the language to catch an expression  here and there, and from my ignorance of what was said my mind was left  at greater freedom for realizing my new and strange position.    I had just had a glance of the sacred city of the Hindus. I had seen at  a short distance the domes of some of the principal temples, and the  minarets of some of the principal mosques, especially those of the  mosque built by Aurungzeb, soaring far above every other object in the  city. I had dimly seen the bathing-places of the people stretching away  for miles, and the houses on the high bank of the river. As I landed I  had seen a few bathing, and a number moving about.    And now, in this poor chapel, with its low roof and earthen floor, I  found a few assembled for the worship of the living God through the Lord  Jesus Christ. I realized, as I had not done before, that I had left my  native land behind, and had come among a people the vast majority of  whom were wholly given to idolatry, and the rest followers of Muhammad,  the bitter enemies of my Lord and Saviour. The greatness and difficulty  of the missionary enterprise presented themselves to me with a painful  vividness, and but for the conviction that the work was of God, and that  my long-cherished desire to enter on it and the gratification of my  desire in my appointment to Benares had come from Him, I should have  been ready to retrace my steps. Yet here I was, worshipping with a few  persons who had been idolaters, and one of whom at least had made great  sacrifices when he had avowed his faith in Jesus. Why should we despise  the day of small things? Forty-four years have elapsed since that, to  me, memorable 31st of March, 1839, and I can now realize myself sitting  with Messrs. Buyers and Lyon in front of that humble pulpit, while Mr.  Shurman preached, and remember, as if it were yesterday, the strange  feelings that thrilled me that afternoon.    [Sidenote: RESIDENCE IN BENARES.]    I had to make no arrangement for my accommodation on reaching Benares.  Previous to my arrival it had been arranged that I was to take up my  abode with my dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. Lyon. I was at once at home  with them, for Mr. Lyon had been my fellow-student at Glasgow, and Mrs.  Lyon was the member of a family with whom I had been intimately  acquainted while studying at Edinburgh. Within a few days of my arrival  I was introduced to the missionaries of the Church Missionary Society,  and to a few European residents who took an interest in missionary  work.          CHAPTER IV.    CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN BENARES.    FROM 1816 TO 1839.      It may be well to give, before proceeding further, a brief account of  what had been done for the evangelization of Benares up to that time.    Our Baptist brethren were first in the field. All who have read the  biography of the illustrious trio of Serampore are aware that they  formed, and with ardent zeal and untiring energy prosecuted, great  schemes for the evangelization of the millions to whose spiritual good  they had consecrated their lives. The translation of the Scriptures into  the languages of India was their special service, but it was far from  standing alone. They were fully alive to the importance of preparing and  sending out men of God to go among the people, and make known to them  Jesus as the Saviour of the world. They gladly availed themselves of  Europeans, Eurasians, and natives, who seemed qualified for the work by  Christian character, zeal for the conversion of the people, and aptness  to teach, though, with few exceptions, destitute of any considerable  measure of mental culture. Some of these agents had force of character  and native talent, and much good and useful work was accomplished by  them. One of their number was Mr. Bowley, who afterwards joined the  Church Mission, and was for many years located at Chunar. He translated  the entire Scriptures into Hindee, and did beside much excellent  literary work in the translation and composition of books and tracts. As  he had no knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, his translation of the Bible  has marked defects, though from his knowledge of Hindee and his good  judgment it has also marked excellences. His translation of the New  Testament is now largely superseded, but his translation of the Old  Testament is the only one yet possessed. The style of his smaller works  in Hindustanee, or Urdu, as it is commonly called, is remarkably  idiomatic and pleasing.    [Sidenote: BAPTIST MISSION IN BENARES.]    Missionary work was commenced in Benares by Mr. William Smith, who was  sent to it by the Serampore missionaries in 1816. I have already  mentioned him as having welcomed me on my arrival. He secured a house  for himself at Raj Ghat, the northern boundary of the city, with a  crowded population around him, and there till his death he lived with  his family, during all the period diligently prosecuting his missionary  work. He had been a drummer in the native army, spoke the Hindustanee as  his mother tongue, and belonged to the large class who, having European  blood in their veins, are professing Christians, but as to their  ordinary habits of life are more native than European. Mr. Smith was a  man of limited education and of little talent, but of sterling  excellence, and secured the respect and love of all classes of the  native community by his kindly and consistent life. For years before his  death there was in his house the strange spectacle of five generations,  and his great-great-grandmother was heard by a friend of mine murmuring,  \"It looks as if God had forgotten to take me away.\" Mrs. Smith, who  was, I believe, a pure native, was a woman of remarkable energy, and  exercised a powerful influence for good on all connected with her. Owing  to the unhappy controversy between the Serampore missionaries and the  Baptist Missionary Society, and the separation in which it ended, Mr.  Smith was left for a time without any salary; but by the establishment  of a Eurasian boarding-school his wants were fully supplied. On to old  age he moved about among the people, conversing with them, going to  their great religious gatherings and distributing tracts and portions of  the Scriptures in a very quiet, unostentatious manner, and succeeded, by  God's blessing, in bringing a few into the fold of Christ.    [Sidenote: CHURCH MISSION IN BENARES.]    Among the pioneers of modern missionary work in India the late Bishop  Corrie, of Madras, has a high and honoured name. He was one of the small  band of Government chaplains who gave themselves heart and soul to the  work of diffusing the gospel among the native population. Henry Martyn  is the best known of this band, and with him men like Brown, Thomason,  and Corrie deserve to be held in everlasting remembrance. Mr. Corrie  was, in 1817, the chaplain of the European community in Benares.  Previous to that time a rich native, Rajah Jay Narayan, had established  and endowed a school in the part of the city inhabited chiefly by  Bengalees. This Rajah formed so high an opinion of Mr. Corrie, and of  his ability to carry on the school efficiently, that he asked him to  undertake its management. Mr. Corrie accepted the offer in the name of  the Church Missionary Society, whose sanction to the measure he had  obtained, and to it the school was made over by formal deed of gift in  1818. Under the name of Jay Narayan's School, and afterwards of Jay  Narayan's College, it has continued down to our day; and it has done  much for the education, on Christian principles, of successive  generations of Benares youth. A Mr. Adlington was the first head-master,  and a short time afterwards a missionary was sent. He was succeeded by  others, but owing to their failure of health little was done on to the  fourth decade of the century, except the securing of suitable ground and  the erection of mission-houses at Segra, in the immediate suburbs of the  city on its southwestern side. This place had formerly been noted for  the thieves and thugs that infested it. In 1839 the two missionaries at  Segra were the Rev. William Smith and the Rev. C. B. Leupolt. Mr. Smith  reached India in 1830, and after spending fifteen months in Goruckpore,  on the borders of Nepal, was transferred to Benares in 1832. He was  joined by Messrs. Knorpp and Leupolt in 1833. The two Church  missionaries in Benares in 1839, Messrs. Smith and Leupolt, laboured for  many years afterwards with singular devotedness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#6)"],[1,"been, though  delayed, as certain of accomplishment, and of a vastly higher and more  satisfactory plane--and the country saved the years of friction and  disgraceful public disorder that characterized the enforcement of the  Congressional plan afterwards adopted.    As to the success of Mr. Lincoln's plans, had they been sanctioned, or  even had they not been repudiated by Congress, Mr. Blaine, in his  book, asserts that Mr. Lincoln, \"By his four years of considerate and  successful administration, by his patient and positive trust in the  ultimate triumph of the Union, realized at last as he stood upon the  edge of the grave--he had acquired so complete an ascendancy over  the public, control in the loyal states, that ANY POLICY MATURED AND  ANNOUNCED BY HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY A VAST MAJORITY OF HIS  COUNTRYMEN.\"    It was indicative of the sagacious foresight of Mr. Lincoln that he did  not call the Congress into special session at the close of the war, as  would have been natural and usual, before attempting the establishment  of any method for the restoration of the revolted States. The fact that  he did not do so, but was making preparations to proceed immediately  in that work on his own lines and in accordance with his own ideas, and  with the hearty accord of his entire Cabinet, of itself affords proof  that he was apprehensive of obstruction from the same element of his  party that subsequently arose in opposition to Mr. Johnson on that  question, and that he preferred to put his plans into operation before  the assembling of Congress in the next regular winter session, in order  that he might be able then to show palpable results, and induce Congress  to accept and follow up a humane, peaceful and satisfactory system of  reconstruction. Mr. Lincoln undoubtedly hoped thus to avoid unnecessary  friction. Having the quite unlimited confidence of the great mass of the  people of the country, of both parties and on both sides of the line of  hostilities, there seem to be excellent reasons for believing that  he would have succeeded, and that the extraordinary and exasperating  differences and local turmoils that followed the drastic measures which  were afterward adopted by Congress over the President's vetoes, would  have been in a very large degree avoided, and THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO  IMPEACHMENT--either of Mr. Lincoln had he lived, or of Mr. Johnson after  him.    It was the misfortune of the time, and of the occasion, which determined  Mr. Lincoln to institute a plan of restoration during the interim  of Congress, that the Republican party, then in absolute control of  Congress, was in no sense equipped for such a work. Its first and great  mission had been the destruction of slavery. Though not phrased in  formal fashion, that was the logic of its creation and existence. It was  brought into being purely as an anti-slavery party, illustrated in the  fact that its membership included every pronounced anti-slavery man,  known as abolitionists, in the United States. All its energies, during  all its life up to the close of the war had been bent to that end. It  had been born and bred to the work of destruction. It came to destroy  slavery, and its forces had been nurtured, to the last day of the war,  in pulling down--in fact, did not then wholly cease.    The work of restoration--the rebuilding of fallen States--had now come.  The Republican party approached that work in the hot blood of war and  the elation of victory--a condition illy fitting the demands of exalted  statesmanship so essential to perfect political effort.    Never had nation or party thrust upon it a more delicate duty or graver  responsibility. It was that of leading a conquered people to build a  new civilization wholly different from the one in ruins. It was first  to reconcile two races totally different from each other, so far as  possible to move in harmony in supplanting servile by free labor, and  the slave by a free American citizen. The transition was sudden, and the  elements antagonistic in race, culture, self-governing power--indeed, in  all the qualities which characterize a free people.    There was a wide margin for honest differences between statesmen  of experience. A universal sentiment could not obtain. The accepted  political leaders of the time were illy equipped to meet the issue--much  less those who had been brought to prominence, and too often to control,  in the hot blood of war and the frictions of the time, when intemperate  denunciation and a free use of the epithets of \"rebel,\" and \"traitor,\"  had become a ready passport to public honors. It was a time when the  admonition to make haste slowly was of profound significance. A peril  greater than any other the civil war had developed, overhung the nation.  Greater than ever the demand for courage in conciliation--for divesting  the issues of all mere partyism, and the yielding of something by the  extremes, both of conservatism and radicalism.        CHAPTER II. --  THE BALTIMORE CONVENTION.    LINCOLN AND JOHNSON NOT NOMINATED AS REPUBLICANS.    Mr. Lincoln had been elected President in 1860, distinctively as a  Republican. In 1864, however, the conditions had changed. The war had  been in progress some three years, during which the insurgents had  illustrated a measure of courage, endurance, and a command of the  engineries of successful warfare that had not been anticipated by the  people of the North. It was seen that to insure the success of the  Union cause it was imperative that there should be thorough unity and  cooperation of the loyal people of all parties--that it was no time  for partisan division among those who hoped ever to see a restored  Republic--that it was necessary to lay aside, as far as possible, mere  partisan issues, and to unite, in the then approaching campaign, upon a  non-partisan, distinctively Union ticket and platform.    Mr. Lincoln had given so satisfactory an administration so wisely,  efficiently, and patriotically had he conducted his great office, that  he was on all sides conceded to be the proper person for nomination  and election. The Convention of 1861 was not called as a Republican  Convention, but distinctively as a Union Convention.    \"The undersigned,\" so ran the call, \"who by original appointment,  or subsequent delegation to fill vacancies, constitute the Executive  Committee created by the National Convention held at Chicago on the 10th  day of May, 1860, do hereby call upon all QUALIFIED VOTERS WHO DESIRE  THE UNCONDITIONAL MAINTENANCE OF THE UNION, THE SUPREMACY OF THE  CONSTITUTION, AND THE COMPLETE SUPPRESSION OF THE EXISTING REBELLION,  WITH THE CAUSE THEREOF, by vigorous war, and all apt and effective  means; to send delegates to a convention to assemble at Baltimore, on  Tuesday, the 7th day of June, 1864, at 12 o'clock noon, for the purpose  of presenting candidates for the offices of President and Vice President  of the United States.\"    The delegates met pursuant to this call. Hon. Edwin D. Morgan, of New  York, Chairman of the Union National Committee, called the Convention  to order, and Robert J. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, was chosen temporary  Chairman. In the course of his introductory address, Mr. Breckinridge  said:    Passing over many things which it would be right for me to say, did the  time serve, and were this the occasion--let me add,--you are a Union  party. Your origin has been referred to as having occurred eight years  ago. In one sense it is true. But you are far older than that. I see  before me not only primitive Republicans and primitive Abolitionists,  but I see also primitive Democrats and primitive Whigs. * * * As a Union  party I will follow you to the ends of the earth, and to the gates  of death. But as an Abolition party--as a Republican party--as a Whig  party--as a Democratic party--as an American party, I will not follow  you one foot.    Mr. William Dennison, of Ohio, was chosen President of the Convention.  On taking the chair he said:    'In no sense do we meet as members or representatives of either of the  old political parties which bound the people, or as the champions of any  principle or doctrine peculiar to either. The extraordinary condition  of the country since the outbreak of the rebellion has, from necessity,  taken from the issues of these parties their practical significance, and  compelled the formation of substantially new political organizations;  hence the organization of the Union Party--if party it can be called--of  which this Convention is for the purpose of its assembling, the  accredited representative, and the only test of membership in which is  an unreserved, unconditional loyalty to the Government and the Union.'    After perfecting its organization the Convention proceeded to ballot  for a nominee for the Presidency, and Mr. Lincoln was unanimously  nominated--the Missouri delegation at first casting its 22 votes for  Gen. Grant, but afterwards changing them to Mr. Lincoln, giving him the  total vote of the Convention--506--on the first and only ballot.    Nominations for the Vice Presidency being next in order, Mr. Lyman  Tremaine, of New York, an old time Democrat, nominated Daniel S.  Dickinson, another old time Democrat and a very distinguished citizen of  that State. In his nominating speech Mr. Tremaine again emphasized that  this Convention was a Union, and not a partisan body, in these words:    'It was well said by the temporary and by the permanent Chairman, that  we meet not here as Republicans. If we do, I have no place in this  Convention; but, like Daniel S. Dickinson, when the first gun was fired  on Sumter, I felt that I should prove false to my revolutionary ancestry  if I could have hesitated to cast partisan ties to the breeze, and rally  around the flag of the Union for the preservation of the Government.'    The Indiana delegation nominated Andrew Johnson, also a Democrat,  and the nomination"]]]
