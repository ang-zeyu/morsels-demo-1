[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31799"],[0,"Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music (#6)"],[1,"  And Tolstoi transmutes a landscape-impression into a musical impression  when he writes, in \"Lucerne\": \"Neither on the lake, nor on the  mountains, nor in the skies, a single straight line, a single unmixed  color, a single point of repose;--everywhere movement, irregularity,  caprice, variety, an incessant interplay of shades and lines, and in it  all the reposefulness, softness, harmony and inevitableness of Beauty.\"    Will this music ever be attained?    \"Not all reach Nirvana; but he who, gifted from the beginning, learns  everything that one ought to learn, experiences all that one should  experience, renounces what one should renounce, develops what one should  develop, realizes what one should realize--he shall reach Nirvana.\"[R]  (Kern, _Geschichte des Buddhismus in Indien_.)      [R] As if anticipating my thoughts, M. Vincent d'Indy has just written    me: \"... laissant de côté les contingences et les petitesses de la    vie pour regarder constamment vers un idéal qu'on ne pourra jamais    atteindre, mais dont il est permis de se rapprocher.\"    If Nirvana be the realm \"beyond the Good and the Bad,\" _one_ way leading  thither is here pointed out. A way to the very portal. To the bars that  divide Man from Eternity--or that open to admit that which was temporal.  Beyond that portal sounds _music_. Not the strains of \"musical  art.\"[S]--It may be, that we must leave Earth to find that music. But  only to the pilgrim who has succeeded on the way in freeing himself from  earthly shackles, shall the bars open.      [S] I think I have read, somewhere, that Liszt confined his Dante    Symphony to the two movements, _Inferno_ and _Purgatorio_, \"because    our tone-speech is inadequate to express the felicities of Paradise.\"          ADDENDA      FEELING--like honesty--is a moral point of honor, an attribute of whose  possession no one will permit denial, which claims a place in life and  art alike. But while, in life, a want of feeling may be forgiven to the  possessor of a more brilliant attribute, such as bravery or impartial  justice, in art feeling is held to be the highest moral qualification.    In music, however, feeling requires two consorts, taste and style. Now,  in life, one encounters real taste as seldom as deep and true feeling;  as for style, it is a province of art. What remains, is a species of  pseudo-emotion which must be characterized as lachrymose hysteria or  turgidity. And, above all, people insist upon having it plainly paraded  before their eyes! It must be underscored, so that everybody shall stop,  look, and listen. The audience sees it, greatly magnified, thrown on the  screen, so that it dances before the vision in vague, importunate  vastness; it is cried on the streets, to summon them that dwell remote  from art; it is gilded, to make the destitute stare in amaze.    For in life, too, the _expressions_ of feeling, by mien and words, are  oftenest employed; rarer, and more genuine, is that feeling which acts  without talk; and most precious is the feeling which hides itself.    \"Feeling\" is generally understood to mean tenderness, pathos, and  extravagance, of expression. But how much more does the marvelous flower  \"Emotion\" enfold! Restraint and forbearance, renunciation, power,  activity, patience, magnanimity, joyousness, and that all-controlling  intelligence wherein feeling actually takes its rise.    It is not otherwise in Art, which holds the mirror up to Life; and still  more outspokenly in Music, which repeats the emotions of Life--though  for this, as I have said, taste and style must be added; Style, which  distinguishes Art from Life.    What the amateur and the mediocre artist attempt to express, is feeling  in little, in detail, for a short stretch.    Feeling on a grand scale is mistaken by the amateur, the semi-artist,  the public (and the critics too, unhappily!), for a want of emotion,  because they all are unable to hear the longer reaches as parts of a yet  more extended whole. Feeling, therefore, is likewise economy.    Hence, I distinguish feeling as Taste, as Style, as Economy. Each a  whole in itself, and each one-third of the Whole. Within and over them  rules a subjective trinity: Temperament, Intelligence, and the instinct  of Equipoise.    These six carry on a dance of such subtility in the choice of partners  and intertwining of figures, in the bearing and the being borne, in  advancing and curtesying, in motion and repose, that no loftier height  of artistry is conceivable.    When the chords of the two triads are in perfect tune, Fantasy may--nay,  must--associate with Feeling; supported by the Six, she will not  degenerate, and out of this combination of all the elements arises  Individuality. The individuality catches, like a lens, the  light-impressions, reflects them, according to its nature, as a  negative, and the hearer perceives the true picture.                               *       *       *    In so far as taste participates in feeling, the latter--like all  else--alters its forms of expression with the period. That is, one  aspect or another of feeling will be favored at one time or another,  onesidedly cultivated, especially developed. Thus, with and after  Wagner, voluptuous sensuality came to the fore; the form of  _intensification of passion_ is still unsurmounted by contemporary  composers. On every tranquil beginning followed a swift upward surge.  Wagner, in this point insatiable, but not inexhaustible, turned from  sheer necessity to the expedient, after reaching a climax, of starting  afresh softly, to soar to a sudden new intensification.    Modern French writers exhibit a revulsion; their feeling is a reflexive  chastity, or perhaps rather a restrained sensualism; the upstriving  mountain-paths of Wagner are succeeded by monotonous plains of twilight  uniformity.    Thus \"style\" forms itself out of feeling, when led by taste.                               *       *       *    The \"Apostles of the Ninth Symphony\" have devised the notion of \"depth\"  in music. It is still current at face-value, especially in Germanic  lands.    There is a depth of feeling, and a depth of thought; the latter is  literary, and can have no application to tones. Depth of feeling, by  contrast, is psychical, and thoroughly germane to the nature of music.  The Apostles of the Ninth Symphony have a peculiar and not quite clearly  defined estimate of \"depth\" in music. _Depth_ becomes _breadth_, and the  attempt is made to attain it through _weight_; it then discovers itself  (through an association of ideas) by a preference for a _deep register_,  and (as I have had opportunity to observe) by the insinuation of a  second, mysterious notion, usually of a literary sort. If these are not  the sole specific signs, they are the most important ones.    To every disciple of philosophy, however, depth of feeling would seem to  imply exhaustiveness in feeling, a complete absorption in the given  mood.    Whoever, surrounded by the full tide of a genuine carnival crowd, slinks  about morosely or even indifferently, neither affected nor carried away  by the tremendous self-satire of mask and motley, by the might of  misrule over law, by the vengeful feeling of wit running riot, shows  himself incapable of sounding the depths of feeling. This gives further  confirmation of the fact, that depth of feeling roots in a complete  absorption in the given mood, however frivolous, and blossoms in the  interpretation of that mood; whereas the current conception of deep  feeling singles out only one aspect of feeling in man, and specializes  that.    In the so-called \"Champagne Aria\" in Don Giovanni there lies more  \"depth\" than in many a funeral march or nocturne:--Depth of feeling also  shows in not wasting it on subordinate or unimportant matters.                               *       *       *    ROUTINE is highly esteemed and frequently required; in musical  \"officialdom\" it is a _sine qua non_. That routine in music should exist  at all, and, furthermore, that it can be nominated as a condition in the  musician's bond, is another proof of the narrow confines of our musical  art. Routine signifies the acquisition of a modicum of experience and  artcraft, and their application to all cases which may occur; hence,  there must be an astounding number of analogous cases. Now, I like to  imagine a species of art-praxis wherein each case should be a new one,  an exception! How helpless and impotent would the army of practical  musicians stand before it!--in the end they would surely beat a retreat,  and disappear. Routine transforms the temple of art into a factory. It  destroys creativeness. For creation means, the bringing form out of the  void; whereas routine flourishes on imitation. It is \"poetry made to  order.\" It rules because it suits the generality: In the theatre, in the  orchestra, in virtuosi, in instruction. One longs to exclaim, \"Avoid  routine! Let each beginning be, as had none been before! Know nothing,  but rather think and feel! For, behold, the myriad strains that once  shall sound have existed since the beginning, ready, afloat in the  æther, and together with them other myriads that shall never be heard.  Only stretch forth your hands, and ye shall grasp a blossom, a breath of  the sea-breeze, a sunbeam; avoid routine, for it strives to grasp only  that wherewith your four walls are filled, and the same over and over  again; the spirit of ease so infects you, that you will scarcely leave  your armchairs, and will lay hold only of what is nearest to hand. And  myriad strains are there since the beginning, still waiting for  manifestation!\"                               *       *       *    \"It is my misfortune, to possess no routine,\" Wagner once wrote Liszt,  when the composition of \"Tristan\" was making no progress. Thus Wagner  deceived himself, and wore a mask for others. He had too much routine,  and his composing-machinery was thrown out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31847"],[0,"Dog Stories from the \"Spectator\" (#6)"],[1,"down from his bench and eats it. This perhaps is  not exactly the same, but it is still a phase of a dog's distrust of  unaccustomed food, and his reasoning power respecting it. This wonderful  reasoning power any one accustomed to dogs soon discovers.              J. B. G.      DOGS AND LANGUAGE.      DO DOGS UNDERSTAND OUR LANGUAGE?              [_Aug. 4, 1883._]    I think the question has been mooted in your columns as to whether dogs  sometimes understand our language. A circumstance that has just occurred  leads me to think that it does happen, where they are highly organised  and living much with their owners. While our family party were sitting  over dessert, a cork jumped from an apollinaris-water bottle on the  sideboard. I took no notice at first, but after the conversation was  ended, I got up and looked about for a few minutes, soon giving up the  search. My brother asked what I was looking for, and I answered. I had  no sooner sat down than our little dog crept from behind a piece of  furniture, where she was reposing on the end of a rug, and went straight  up to the cork, looking up at me and pointing to it with her nose. It  was near me, but the shadow thrown by the table prevented my seeing it.  She is a very nervous little fox-terrier, a most \"comfort-loving  animal,\" and spends her life with one or the other of us on my sofa,  when her master is out, but hearing his voice at a great distance, and  always attending to it.              ANYTHING BUT A DOG-FANCIER.      HOW OUR MEANING IS CONVEYED TO ANIMALS.              [_Aug. 11, 1883._]    The following anecdote may interest some of your readers:--Some years  ago, when starting for a foreign tour, I entrusted my little Scotch  terrier, Pixie, to the care of my brother, who lived about three miles  distant from my house. I was away for six weeks, during the whole of  which time Pixie remained contentedly at his new abode. The day,  however, before I returned, my brother mentioned in the dog's hearing  that I was expected back the next day. Thereupon, the dog started off,  and was found by me at my bedroom door the next morning, he having been  seen waiting outside the house early in the morning when the servants  got up, and been admitted by them. Pixie is still alive and flourishing,  and readily lends himself to experiments, which, however, yield no very  definite result. He certainly seems to understand as much of our meaning  as it concerns his own comfort to understand, but how he does it I  cannot quite determine. I should be sorry to affirm, clever as he is,  that he understands French and German, yet it is certainly a fact that  he will fall back just as readily if I say \"Zurueck!\" as if I say \"To  heel!\" and advance to the sound \"En avant!\" as well as to \"Hold up!\" As  in both cases I am careful to avoid any elucidatory gesture or special  tone of voice, I am inclined to think that there must be here a species  of direct thought transference. At the same time, I am bound to add that  without the spoken word I am unable to convey the slightest meaning to  him. This, however, may be due to what I believe to be a fact, that it  is almost impossible without word or gesture to formulate the will with  any distinctness. If this theory be correct, the verbal sounds used  would convey the speaker's meaning, not in virtue of the precise sounds  themselves, but of the intention put into them by the speaker. I should  be glad to know if the experience of others tends to confirm this  theory, which I do not remember to have seen suggested before.              A. EUBULE-EVANS.                [_Aug. 18, 1883._]    I beg to contribute another anecdote on the subject of how our meaning  is conveyed to animals. When I was in Norway with my husband, a dog  belonging to the people of the house went with us in all our walks. One  day a strange dog joined us, and seemed to wish to get up a fight with  our dog, Fechter, who for protection kept almost under our feet; my  husband said several times, \"Go on, Fechter,\" in English, which he  immediately did, but soon came back again. At last we succeeded in  driving the strange dog away, but he soon returned. Then my husband said  without any alteration of tone or gesture that I was aware of, \"Drive  that dog away, Fechter.\" He immediately rushed at him, and we saw no  more of our troubler. I have long thought that dogs do understand, not  \"the precise sounds themselves, but the intention put into them by the  speaker.\"              AN OBSERVER OF ANIMALS.      ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE.              [_Aug. 18, 1883._]    Perhaps I should have said the \"Intelligence of Animals,\" but my  meaning, in relation to the interesting correspondence in your columns,  is no doubt clear. The whole question seems to me to lie in the  proverbial nutshell, and to be solvable by the proverbial common sense.  Dogs' hearing is undoubtedly very keen and accurate, and even subtle;  and dogs have also the power of putting this and that together in a  marvellously shrewd and almost rational fashion. They cannot understand  sentences, but they get hold of words, _i.e._, sounds, and keep them  pigeon-holed in their memory. I might as well argue moral principle  from the fact that my dog Karl, like scores of other dogs, will hold a  piece of biscuit on his nose so long as I say \"trust,\" and will when I  say \"paid for\" gaily toss his head and catch the biscuit in his honest  mouth, as argue that because he finds eleven tennis-balls among the  shrubs in five minutes, when I say, \"We can't find them at all, Karl; do  go and find them, good dog, will you? Find the balls, old  fellow\"--therefore he understands my sentence. He simply grasps the  words \"find\" and \"balls,\" sees the game at a standstill, and reasons out  our needs and his responsibilities, quickened by the expectation of  pattings on the head, pettings, and pieces of biscuit. It is remarkable  that if I try to delude him by uttering \"base coin\" in the shape of  words just like the real words, as, for example, if I say \"Jacob\"  instead of \"paid for,\" he makes no mistake, but refuses the morsel,  however delicate, till it _is_ \"paid for.\"    Prominent nouns, participles, verbs, &c., make up the _lingua franca_  that so beautifully links together men and dogs, and now and then men  and horses, their intelligence being quickened by their dumbness, as is  that of deaf and dumb men and women, whose other faculties become so  keenly intensified, and who put this and that together so much more  quickly than do we who have all our faculties. There are of course  \"Admiral Crichtons\" among dogs, as there are among men, but the  difference between dog and dog will generally, I think, be traceable  more to human training than to born capacity. The yearning look which  Karl gives when (told to \"speak\") he gives forth his voice in response,  is sometimes piteously like \"Oh, that I could really tell all I feel!\"  He is like, and all dogs of average intelligence are like, the Frenchman  I met yesterday on the beach at Hastings, who wanted to know whether he  could reach Ramsgate on foot before nightfall, and how far it was, and  who, as I only know a few French words, and am utterly unable to speak  or understand sentences, was obliged to make me understand his wants by  a few nouns such as everybody knows, and by causing me to put this and  that together. There is of course the vital defect in the parallel that  I could learn to understand French, and the dog could never learn to  understand sentences; but as so many parallels have vital defects of  some kind, even down to that historic self-drawn parallel between  Alexander and the robber, we may well say, whether we be men or dogs,  \"Let me reflect.\" Dogs do undoubtedly reflect, and reason, and remember;  and they never forget their \"grammar,\" as school-boys do. Instinct, like  chance, is only a name expressing fitly enough our own ignorance. Did  not Luther and Wesley believe in the resurrection of animals?              S. B. JAMES.                [_Aug. 25, 1883._]    A little illustration of canine intelligence shown by my collie, Dido,  may be added to those which have lately appeared in the _Spectator_. The  dog was lying on the floor in a room in which I was preparing to go out.  An old servant was present, and when I had given her directions about  an errand on which she was going, I said, \"You will take Dido with you?\"  She assented, and the dog directly got up to follow her downstairs. I  then remembered that I should want a cab, so I asked the servant to send  one, and not to leave the house till I rang the bell. On her leaving the  room, Dido resumed her quiet attitude on the floor, with her nose to the  carpet. In rather less than ten minutes I rang the bell, and the dog at  once sprang up and ran downstairs to join her companion. I had not  spoken a word after asking the servant to wait for the bell. Was this  word-reading, or voice-reading, or thought-reading.              S. E. DE MORGAN.      ANIMALS AND LANGUAGE.              [_Sept. 1, 1883._]    I can match Mrs. De Morgan's pretty story of her Dido. A wise old dog  with whom I have the privilege to associate was, two or three days ago,  lying asleep in her basket by the fire. I entered the room with my hat  on, and invited her to join me in a walk; but, after looking up at me  for a moment, as canine politeness required, she dropped back among her  cushions, obviously replying, \"Thank you very much, but I prefer  repose.\" Thereupon I observed, in a clear voice, \"I am _not_ going on  the road [a promenade disliked by the dogs, because the walls on either  side restrict the spirit of scientific research]; I am going up the  mountain.\" Instantly my little friend jumped up, shook her ears, and,  with a cheerful bark, announced herself as ready to join the party.    Beyond doubt or question, Colleen had either understood the word \"road,\"  or the word \"mountain,\" or both, and"]]]
