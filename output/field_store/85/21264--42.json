Dodge.    _Tennessee._--Samuel Milligan, Josiah M. Anderson, Robert L.  Carruthers, Thomas Martin, Isaac R. Hawkins, R.J. McKinney, Alvin  Cullom, William P. Hickerson, George W. Jones, F.K. Zollicoffer,  William H. Stephens, A.W.O. Totten.    _Illinois._--John Wood, Stephen T. Logan, John M. Palmer, Burton C.  Cook, Thomas J. Turner.    Which report was accepted, and the names of the Commissioners were  entered upon the record.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--Certain printing has been ordered, but no provision  has been made for paying for it. The Committee on Rules have therefore  requested me to report the following resolution:         _Resolved_, That the Secretary procure for the use of the       Convention the necessary stationery, and also provide for       such printing as may be ordered. That the Journal, up to and       including this day's proceeding, as well as the Rules, be       printed for the use of the members.    The resolution of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.    The PRESIDENT:--The respective delegations have recommended, and the  Chair announces the names of the following gentlemen to compose the  committee ordered to be raised under the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE,  which was adopted yesterday:--New Hampshire, Asa Fowler; Vermont,  Hiland Hall; Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Samuel Ames;  Connecticut, Roger S. Baldwin; New Jersey, Joseph F. Randolph;  Pennsylvania, Thomas White; Delaware, Daniel M. Bates; North Carolina,  Thomas Ruffin; Kentucky, James Guthrie; Ohio, Thomas Ewing; Indiana,  Caleb B. Smith; Illinois, Stephen T. Logan; Iowa, James Harlan;  Maryland, Reverdy Johnson; Virginia, James A. Seddon.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--The Committee on Rules have further considered the  rule relating to the secrecy of the debates and proceedings of this  body, and their convictions as to the necessity and propriety of its  adoption remain unchanged. The prospect of an ultimate agreement among  the Commissioners composing this body, in the opinion of the  committee, would be materially lessened if all or any of its debates  should be made public, for reasons which have already been stated. If  any gentleman should desire to communicate with the Executive or  Legislative authorities of his State any facts, during the progress of  our business, I apprehend little difficulty would be experienced in  obtaining the leave of the Convention. We therefore recommend the  following Rule:         XIX. That nothing spoken in the Convention be printed, or       otherwise published or communicated, without leave.    Mr. SEDDON:--I do not desire to discuss the adoption of the rule under  consideration any further than I have already. The Commissioners from  the State of Virginia are appointed under resolutions which make it  their duty to communicate from time to time with her deliberative  assemblies. We do not wish to have our right to do so subject to the  action of this or any other body. It is no answer to this to say, that  there is no doubt that the leave to make the necessary communications  will be accorded to us when we ask it. We do not wish to ask it. We  insist upon our rights in this respect, as it is our duty to the State  that sent us here to do.    The rule was adopted upon a count of the members voting.    On motion, the Convention adjourned.    After the adjournment, the Convention in a body called upon the  PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, when the several delegations were  introduced by President TYLER, and the several Commissioners were  presented by the chairmen of the several delegations.          FIFTH DAY.    WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, _February 8th, 1861._      The Convention was called to order at 12 o'clock by President TYLER.  Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. BUTLER. After sundry amendments, the  Journal was approved.    Mr. SUMMERS:--I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report  that they find the following gentlemen duly accredited as members of  the Convention:    _New York._--David Dudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S.  Wadsworth, Erastus Corning, Amaziah B. James, James C. Smith, Addison  Gardner, Greene C. Bronson, John A. King, John E. Wool.    _Massachusetts._--John Z. Goodrich, John M. Forbes, Richard P. Waters,  Theophilus P. Chandler, Francis B. Crowninshield, George S. Boutwell,  Charles Allen.    _Missouri._--John D. Coalter, Alexander W. Doniphan, Waldo P. Johnson,  Aylett H. Buckner, Harrison Hough.    On motion of the respective delegations the following gentlemen were  added to the committee raised on the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE:    _New York._--Mr. Field.  _Missouri._--Mr. Doniphan.  _Tennessee._--Mr. Zollicoffer.    Mr. GUTHRIE:--I am instructed by the committee raised upon the  resolution introduced by myself, to inform the Convention that that  body is not able to report to-day, agreeable to the suggestion made at  the time they were appointed. Several States are yet unrepresented on  the committee, and delegations from some of them have only arrived  this morning. I am therefore directed to ask for further time to make  a report, assuring the Convention, at the same time, that a report  will be made at soon as a proper regard to the interests of all  sections will permit it to be done.    Mr. CLAY:--I move that the time for the report of the committee be  extended until Monday next. As in the mean time there will be little  business for the Convention to do, and that of a formal character, it  might be as well to adjourn from this time until Monday; and I move  further, that if delegates arrive from States now unrepresented, they  may present their credentials to the committee, and if no question  arises on them, they may then select a member of the committee on Mr.  GUTHRIE'S resolution, and report his name to the Secretary of that  committee.    Mr. SEDDON:--I object to an adjournment until Monday. We can meet here  to-morrow and do any business which may come before us.    The several motions of Mr. CLAY, with the alteration suggested by Mr.  SEDDON, were then agreed to without a division.    Mr. ELLIS:--I move that the President be requested to issue cards of  admission to the members and officers of this Convention.    Which motion was adopted.    Mr. HITCHCOCK:--I would like to understand whether we all construe the  rule referring to the secrecy of our transactions alike. I am told  that different constructions are placed upon it by different members,  and would suggest the propriety of the PRESIDENT'S giving his views of  the meaning of the rule.    The PRESIDENT:--I understand, by the correct interpretation of the  rule, that nothing which is said or done in the Convention having  reference to any subject of business in it, can be spoken of or  disclosed to any but members.    The Convention then adjourned.          SIXTH DAY.    WASHINGTON, SATURDAY, _February 9th, 1861._      The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT. Prayer was  offered by Rev. Dr. BULLOCK. The Journal was read, corrected, and  approved.    Mr. SUMMERS:--I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report  as members of this Convention the names of the following gentlemen  from the State of Maine:--William P. Fessenden, Lot M. Morrill, Daniel  E. Somes, John J. Perry, Ezra B. French, Freeman H. Morse, Stephen  Coburn, Stephen C. Foster.    Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, and Mr. CROWNINSHIELD, of Massachusetts, were  announced as members of the committee under the resolution of Mr.  GUTHRIE.    Mr. TUCK:--I offer certain resolutions, which I desire to have printed  and referred to the Committee on Resolutions.    The resolutions of Mr. TUCK were read, ordered to be printed, and  referred. (These resolutions will be found on a subsequent page.)    Mr. CLAY:--I hold in my hand the proceedings of a very large  Democratic meeting recently held at New Haven, in the State of  Connecticut. Among them are certain resolutions, breathing a spirit of  fervent devotion to the Union, and expressing an anxious desire for  the settlement of the difficult questions now before the country. They  have been sent to me with a request that I should lay them before this  Convention. Why I was selected by them for the performance of this  duty, I do not know, unless it was because, from my name and  associations, they thought an assurance might be found that I  participated in the sentiments expressed in the resolutions. I present  them with great pleasure, and ask that they may be referred to the  Committee on Resolutions.    The motion of Mr. CLAY was agreed to.    Mr. RANDOLPH:--I move that the Secretary be requested to furnish for  the use of the members a printed list of the delegates to and officers  of this Convention.    Which motion was adopted, and the Convention adjourned.          SEVENTH DAY.    WASHINGTON, MONDAY, _February 11th, 1861._      The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT. Prayer was  offered by Rev. Dr. GURLEY.    After the reading and amendment of the Journal, Mr. GUTHRIE, from the  Committee on Resolutions, asked for further time to make a general  report of the matters submitted to them, which was given; and  thereupon Mr. GUTHRIE, from the same Committee, made the following  report upon the resolutions of a meeting in the State of Connecticut,  which were referred to that committee on motion of Mr. CLAY:         The committee to whom were referred certain resolutions of       the Democratic party of the State of Connecticut, report       that in the opinion of the committee it is inexpedient for       this Convention to act upon any resolution purporting to       emanate from any political party whatever; and that the       member of the Convention by whom they were presented have       leave to withdraw the same.    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24562"],[0,"The Panjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir (#6)"],[1,"of the Tochi valley the country rises into lofty  mountains. The upper waters of the Tochi and its affluents drain two  fine glens known as Birmal and Shawal to the west of the country of the  Mahsud Wazirs. The Tochi valley is the direct route from India to  Ghazni, and nine centuries ago, when that decayed town was the capital  of a powerful kingdom, it must often have heard the tramp of armed men.  The loftiest peaks in Waziristan, Shuidar (11,000 feet) and Pirghal  (11,600 feet), overhang Birmal. Further south, Wana, our post in  south-west Waziristan, overlooks from its plateau the Gomal valley.    ~The Gomal Pass as a trade route.~--East of Kajuri Kach the Gomal flows  through tribal territory to the Gomal pass from which it debouches into  the plains of the Dera Ismail Khan district. \"The Gomal route is the  oldest of all trade routes. Down it there yearly pours a succession of  _kafilas_ (caravans) led and followed up by thousands of well-armed  Pathan traders, called Powindahs, from the plains of Afghanistan to  India. The Powindahs mostly belong to the Ghilzai tribes, and are not  therefore true Afghans[1]. Leaving their women and children encamped  within British territory on our border, and their arms in the keeping of  our frontier political officials, the Powindah makes his way southwards  with his camel loads of fruit and silk, bales of camel and goat hair or  sheepskin goods, carpets and other merchandise from Kabul and Bokhara,  and conveys himself through the length and breadth of the Indian  peninsula.... He returns yearly to the cool summits of the Afghan hills  and the open grassy plains, where his countless flocks of sheep and  camels are scattered for the summer grazing\" (Holdich's _India_, pp.  80-81).    ~Physical features of hilly country between Peshawar and the Gomal  river.~--The physical features of the hill country between Peshawar and  the Gomal pass may best be described in the words of Sir Thomas Holdich:         \"Natural landscape beauty, indeed, may here be measured to a       certain extent by altitude. The low ranges of sun-scorched,       blackened ridge and furrow formation which form the approaches to       the higher altitudes of the Afghan upland, and which are almost as       regularly laid out by the hand of nature in some parts of the       frontier as are the parallels ... of the engineer who is besieging       a fortress--these are by no means 'things of beauty,' and it is       this class of formation and this form of barren desolation that is       most familiar to the frontier officer.... Shades of delicate purple       and grey will not make up for the absence of the living green of       vegetation.... But with higher altitudes a cooler climate and       snow-fed soil is found, and as soon as vegetation grasps a       root-hold there is the beginning of fine scenery. The upper       pine-covered slopes of the Safed Koh are as picturesque as those of       the Swiss Alps; they are crowned by peaks whose wonderful altitudes       are frozen beyond the possibility of vegetation, and are usually       covered with snow wherever snow can lie. In Waziristan, hidden away       in the higher recesses of its great mountains, are many valleys of       great natural beauty, where we find the spreading poplar and the       ilex in all the robust growth of an indigenous flora.... Among the       minor valleys Birmal perhaps takes precedence by right of its       natural beauty. Here are stretches of park-like scenery where       grass-covered slopes are dotted with clumps of _deodar_ and pine       and intersected with rivulets hidden in banks of fern; soft green       glades open out to view from every turn in the folds of the hills,       and above them the silent watch towers of Pirghal and Shuidar ...       look down from their snow-clad heights across the Afghan uplands to       the hills beyond Ghazni.\" (Holdich's _India_, pp. 81-82.)    ~The Suliman Range.~--A well-marked mountain chain runs from the Gomal to  the extreme south-west corner of the Dera Ghazi Khan district where the  borders of Biluchistan, Sind, and the Panjab meet. It culminates forty  miles south of the Gomal in the fine Kaisargarh mountain (11,295 feet),  which is a very conspicuous object from the plains of the Derajat. On  the side of Kaisargarh there is a shrine called Takht i Suliman or  Throne of Solomon, and this is the name by which Englishmen usually know  the mountain, and which has been passed on to the whole range.  Proceeding southwards the general elevation of the chain drops  steadily. But Fort Munro, the hill station of the Dera Ghazi Khan  district, 200 miles south of the Takht, still stands 6300 feet above sea  level, and it looks across at the fine peak of Ekbhai, which is more  than 1000 feet higher. In the south of the Dera Ghazi Khan district the  general level of the chain is low, arid the Giandari hill, though only  4160 feet above the sea, stands out conspicuously. Finally near where  the three jurisdictions meet the hills melt into the Kachh Gandava  plain. Sir Thomas Holdich's description of the rugged Pathan hills  applies also to the Suliman range. Kaisargarh is a fine limestone  mountain crowned by a forest of the edible _chilgoza_ pine. But the  ordinary tree growth, where found at all, is of a much humbler kind,  consisting of gnarled olives and dwarf palms.    ~Passes and torrents in Suliman Hills.~--The drainage of the western  slopes of the Suliman range finding no exit on that side has had to wear  out ways for itself towards the plains which lie between the foot of the  hills and the Indus. This is the explanation of the large number of  passes, about one hundred, which lead from the plains into the Suliman  hills. The chief from north to south are the Vehoa, the Sangarh, the  Khair, the Kaha, the Chachar, and the Siri, called from the torrents  which flow through them to the plains. There is an easy route through  the Chachar to Biluchistan. But unfortunately the water of the torrent  is brackish.    ~Sub Himalaya or Siwaliks.~--In its lowest ridges the Himalaya drops to a  height of about 5000 feet. But the traveller to any of the summer  resorts in the mountains passes through a zone of lower hills  interspersed sometimes with valleys or \"duns.\" These consist of Tertiary  sandstones, clays, and boulder conglomerates, the debris in fact which  the Himalaya has dropped in the course of ages. To this group of hills  and valleys the general name of Siwaliks is given. East of the Jhelam it  includes the Nahan hills to the north of Ambala, the low hills of  Kangra, Hoshyarpur, Gurdaspur, and Jammu, and the Pabbi hills in Gujrat.  But it is to the west of the Jhelam that the system has its greatest  extension. Practically the whole of the soil of the plains of the  Attock, Rawalpindi, and Jhelam districts consists of disintegrated  Siwalik sandstone, and differs widely in appearance and agricultural  quality from the alluvium of the true Panjab plains. The low hills of  these districts belong to the same system, but the Salt Range is only in  part Siwalik. Altogether Siwalik deposits in the Panjab cover an area of  13,000 square miles. Beyond the Indus the hills of the Kohat district  and a part of the Suliman range are of Tertiary age.    ~The Great Panjab Plain.~--The passage from the highlands to the plains is  as a rule abrupt, and the contrast between the two is extraordinary.  This is true without qualification of the tract between the Jamna and  the Jhelam. It is equally true of British districts west of the Jhelam  and south of the Salt Range and of lines drawn from Kalabagh on the west  bank of the Indus southwards to Paniala and thence north-west through  the Pezu pass to the Waziristan hills. In all that vast plain, if we  except the insignificant hills in the extreme south-west of the province  ending to the north in the historic ridge at Delhi, some hillocks of  gneiss near Tosham in Hissar, and the curious little isolated rocks at  Kirana, Chiniot, and Sangla near the Chenab and Jhelam, the only  eminences are petty ridges of windblown sand and the \"_thehs_\" or mounds  which represent the accumulated debris of ancient village sites. At the  end of the Jurassic period and later this great plain was part of a sea  bed. Far removed as the Indian ocean now is the height above sea level  of the Panjab plain east of the Jhelam is nowhere above 1000 feet. Delhi  and Lahore are both just above the 700 feet line. The hills mentioned  above are humble time-worn outliers of the very ancient Aravalli system,  to which the hills of Rajputana belong. Kirana and Sangla were already  of enormous age, when they were islands washed by the waves of the  Tertiary sea. A description of the different parts of the vast Panjab  plain, its great stretches of firm loam, and its tracts of sand and sand  hills, which the casual observer might regard as pure desert, will be  given in the paragraphs devoted to the different districts.    ~The Salt Range.~--The tract west of the Jhelam, and bounded on the south  by the Salt Range cis-Indus, and trans-Indus by the lines mentioned  above, is of a more varied character. Time worn though the Salt Range  has become by the waste of ages, it still rises at Sakesar, near its  western extremity, to a height of 5000 feet. The eastern part of the  range is mostly in the Jhelam district, and there the highest point is  Chail (3700 feet). The hill of Tilla (3242 feet), which is a marked  feature of the landscape looking westwards from Jhelam cantonment, is on  a spur running north-east from the main chain. The Salt Range is poorly  wooded, the dwarf acacia or _phulahi_ (Acacia modesta), the olive, and  the _sanattha_ shrub (Dodonea viscosa) are the commonest species. But  these jagged and arid hills include some not infertile valleys, every  inch of which is put under crop by the crowded population. To geologists  the range is of"]]]
