Average and extreme measurements of nine adults of both sexes of _M.  p. drummondii_ from E side Minaker River, 1 mi. W Trutch, British  Columbia, are as follows: Total length, 157 (148-165); length of tail,  42 (37-46); condylobasal length, 25.1 (24.7-26.0); basal length, 24.2  (23.4-25.0); length of nasals, 6.8 (6.4-7.2); zygomatic breadth, 14.4  (13.9-14.7); breadth across auditory bullae, 12.4 (12.0-12.7);  alveolar length of upper molariform tooth-row, 6.1 (6.0-6.2); Nine  adults of both sexes from McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 miles northwest  of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, have the following measurements: 153  (147-168); 40 (33-47); 24.9 (24.2-25.5); 24.0 (23.6-24.6); 6.6  (6.2-7.2); 14.4 (13.9-15.1); 12.1 (11.7-12.5); 6.1 (6.0-6.2).

(Type \"taken    in tundra-slide above timber-line on mountain top near Tepee Lake    on north slope of St. Elias Range,\" Yukon Territory, Canada.)    _Specimen examined._--One from _Alaska_: Fish Creek, 3400 ft., 5 mi. N  and 1 mi. E Paxson.    _Remarks._--The single adult male, obtained by Alcorn, has been  compared by Dr. Henry W. Setzer with specimens of _Microtus muriei_  Nelson, _M. miurus miurus_ Osgood, and _M. m. oreas_ Osgood in the  United States National Museum. He reports that the specimen is related  most closely to _M. miurus_ but exhibits characters by which it is, at  least, subspecifically distinct from these two forms of this species.  Three specimens of _M. andersoni_ Rand and one of _M. cantator_  Anderson, borrowed from the National Museum of Canada are less mature  than the specimen in question. Even so, the male from Fish Creek is  less gray than _M. andersoni_ and as seen from measurements of the  type, an adult male (Rand, 1945:42), is larger with longer tail and  has a shorter and narrower skull and is judged to be taxonomically  separable. _M. cantator_ was named from two specimens; both the  paratype (seen by me) and seemingly the type are too young to show  clearly subspecific characters. Alcorn's specimen is tentatively  referred to _M. cantator_ until some adult topotypes can be obtained.  Measurements of the male, No. 21539, from Fish Creek, are: Total  length, 152; length of tail, 30; hind foot, 22; condylobasal length,  28.0; basal length, 26.6; length of nasals, 7.1; zygomatic breadth,  13.8; breadth across auditory bullae, 11.5; least interorbital  breadth, 3.3; alveolar length of upper molariform tooth-row, 6.2.    Alcorn took this specimen in an area above timberline where a low  growth of willow was the dominant vegetation. Traps were set where he  had seen a mouse go into a small burrow. The next morning, August 18,  1947, he found this specimen and two _Microtus oeconomus macfarlani_  in his traps.    Microtines of the subgenus _Stenocranius_ from continental areas of  Alaska and Northwestern Canada are represented in collections by a few  specimens from widely separated localities. Lacking material from  intermediate localities, describers have given specific recognition to  several of these isolated populations. Future collecting will be  necessary to disclose whether the North American mice of this subgenus  belong to one or to more than one species and may disclose whether or  not there has been more than one invasion of the North American  continent by members of this Asiatic group.

These specimens are less gray and more brown than  specimens more typical of _M. l. vellerosus_ from the Liard River  area.    Alcorn found the long-tailed meadow mouse in widely separated areas.  Most specimens were obtained in grassy situations near water or on  moist ground. The single male from Summit Pass in British Columbia was  taken above timberline.

S Haines, 5 ft.,  20.    _Remarks._--In comparison with the series of _M. l. vellerosus_ from  the Liard River area, the long-tailed meadow mice from near Haines are  more reddish brown, have a longer tail, and have a smaller skull with  smaller auditory bullae. This subspecies is restricted to the coastal  area, and as noted under the account of _M. l. vellerosus_,  intergradation between these two forms occurs a relatively short  distance inland.

Stonehouse Creek  and Kelsall River, 2.    _Remarks._--Alcorn found the tundra mouse in many of the localities at  which he trapped in east-central Alaska. Specimens were taken above  timberline, along roads, in grassy areas which had been cleared of  timber, and in low vegetation bordering streams. On August 17 at Fish  Creek, 5 miles north and 1 mile east of Paxson, Alaska, Alcorn  obtained one of these mice in a tree in the daytime. Immature  specimens taken at Stonehouse Creek are, to my knowledge, the first  records for this species in British Columbia.

Another method of annealing is to cover the hot glass with hot sand, and  allow it to cool therein.    As in the case of lead glass, so with soda glass. A thorough  acquaintance with the effect of the various parts of the flame upon it  should be gained before further work is entered upon, for which purpose  an hour or more spent in observing its behaviour in the flame will be  fully repaid by increased success subsequently.      =The Use of Combustion Tube.=--It is often necessary to construct  apparatus of what is known as hard glass or combustion tube. It is  almost as easy to work combustion tube as to deal with lead and soda  glass if the oxy-hydrogen flame be employed.    It is not necessary to set up a special apparatus for this purpose; many  of the ordinary blow-pipes can be used with oxygen instead of with air.  It is only necessary to connect the air-tube of the blow-pipe with a  bottle of compressed oxygen instead of with the bellows. The connecting  tube should not be too wide nor too long, in order to avoid the  accumulation in it, by accident, of large quantities of explosive  mixtures.    Two precautions are necessary in manipulating hard glass in the  oxy-hydrogen flame. The glass must _not_ be overheated. At first one is  very apt to go wrong in this direction. The supply of oxygen must _not_  be too great; a small hissing flame is not what is wanted. If either of  these precautions are neglected most glass will devitrify badly. With a  little care and experience, devitrification can be absolutely avoided.  Ordinary combustion tube can be used, but I find that the glass tube  (Verbrennungsroehr) made by Schott & Co. of Jena, which can be obtained  through any firm of dealers in apparatus, is far better than the  ordinary tube.    By following these instructions, any one who has learned how to work  with lead or soda glass will find it easy to manipulate hard glass.          CHAPTER III.    _CUTTING AND BENDING GLASS--FORMING GLASS APPARATUS BEFORE THE  BLOW-PIPE--MAKING AND GRINDING STOPPERS TO APPARATUS, ETC._      In the later pages of this Chapter it will be assumed that the  operations first described have been mastered. The beginner should  therefore practise each operation until he finds himself able to perform  it with some degree of certainty. Generally speaking, however, after the  failure of two or three attempts to perform any operation, it is best to  give up for a few hours, and proceed to the work next described,  returning to that upon which you have failed subsequently. If,  unfortunately, it should happen that the work next in order involves the  performance of the operation in which the failure has occurred, it is  best to pass on to some later work which does not demand this particular  accomplishment, or to rest a while, and re-attack the difficulty when  refreshed.      =Cutting Glass Tubes.=--The simplest method of cutting a glass tube is  to make a sharp scratch with a file across the glass at the point where  it is desired to cut it, and on pulling apart the two ends, it will  break clean off. It is important that the file be sharp. In pulling  apart the ends the scratch should be held upwards, and the pull should  have a downward direction, which will tend to open out the scratch. In  the case of a large tube, a scratch will not ensure its breaking clean  across. The tube must be filed to some depth, half-way, or even all  round it. A good way of breaking a tube is to place the file in the  table after scratching the glass, to hold the glass tube above its edge  with one hand on each side of the scratch, and to strike the under side  of the tube a sharp blow upon the edge of the file, directly beneath the  scratch. In this way very even fractures of large and moderately thin  tubes may be made. It answers particularly well for removing short ends  of tube, not long enough to hold; the tube is held firmly upon the file,  and a sharp blow given to the short end with a piece of large tube or a  key.    A file whose faces have been ground till they are nearly smooth, so as  to leave very finely-serrated edges, will be found useful for cutting  glass tubes. Such a file should be used almost as a knife is used for  cutting a pencil in halves.    The simple methods just described are too violent to be applied to  delicate apparatus, too tedious when employed upon the largest tubes,  and very difficult to apply when the tube to be cut is very thin, or too  short to permit the operator to get a good grip of it on either side of  the file mark. In such cases, one or other of the following methods will  be useful:--    1. Make a scratch with a file, and touch it with the end of a _very  small_ piece of glass drawn out and heated at the tip to its melting  point. It is important that the heated point of glass be very small,  or the fracture is likely to be uneven, or to spread in several  directions. Also, it is best to use hot soda glass for starting cracks  in tubes of soda glass, and lead glass for doing so in lead glass  tubes. If the crack does not pass quite round the tube, you may pull  it asunder, as previously described, or you may bring the heated piece  of glass with which the crack was started to one end of the crack, and  slowly move it (nearly touching the glass) in the required direction;  the crack will extend, following the movements of the hot glass.  Instead of hot glass, pastils of charcoal are sometimes employed for  this purpose. They continue to burn when once lighted, and there is  no need to re-heat them from time to time. They should be brought as  close to the glass as is possible without touching it, and, when no  longer needed, should be extinguished by placing the lighted end under  sand, or some other incombustible powder, for they must not be wetted.    2. A method much practised by the makers of sheet glass, and suitable  for large objects, is to wrap a thread of hot glass round the tube, at  once removing it, and touching any point of the glass which the thread  covered with water or a cold iron, when a crack will be started and will  pass round the glass where it was heated by the thread.    3. Tubes which are large and slightly conical may have a ring of red-hot  iron passed over them till it comes into contact with the glass, then,  the iron being removed, and a point on the heated glass being at once  touched with cold iron as before, it will break as desired. Or a string,  moistened with turpentine, may be loosely twisted round the tube, and  the turpentine ignited, afterwards the application of sudden cold to any  point on the zone of hot glass will usually start a crack, which, if  necessary, may be continued in the usual manner. The last three methods  are chiefly useful in dealing with the largest and thickest tubes, and  with bottles.    A fairly stout copper wire, bent into the form of a bow so that it can  be applied when hot to a considerable surface of a glass tube, will be  found superior to the point of hot glass or metal usually employed, for  leading cracks in glass tubes. With such a wire a tube can be cut so  that the cross section of the end is at any desired angle to the axis of  the tube, with considerable precision. I am indebted for this suggestion  to Mr. Vernon Boys and Dr. Ebert.      =Bending Glass Tubes.=--The blow-pipe flame is not a suitable source of  heat for bending tubes, except in certain cases which will be mentioned  in a subsequent paragraph. For small tubes, and those of moderate size,  a fish-tail burner, such as is used for purposes of illumination, will  answer best. Use a flame from one to two inches in breadth--from _A_ to  _A_ (Fig. 6), according to the size of the tube which is to be bent. If  the length of tube that is heated be less than this, the bend will  probably buckle on its concave side.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    The tube to be heated should be held in the position shown in Fig. 6,  supported by the hands on each side. It should be constantly rotated in  the flame, that it may be equally heated on all sides. In the figure the  hands are represented above the tube, with their backs upwards. A tube  can be held equally well from below, the backs of the hands being then  directed downwards, and this, I think, is the more frequent habit. It is  difficult to say which position of the hands is to be preferred. I  lately observed how a tube was held by three skilful amateurs and by a  professional glass-blower. All the former held the tube with the hands  below it. The latter, however, held it from above, as in Fig. 6. He,  however, was working with a rather heavy piece of tube, and I am  inclined myself to recommend that position in such cases. During a long  spell of work, the wrist may be rested from time to time by changing the  position of the hands.    When the tube has softened, remove it from the flame, and gently bend  it to the desired angle. The side of the tube last exposed to the flame  will be slightly hotter, and therefore softer, than that which is  opposite to it. This hotter side should form the concave side of the  bent tube.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    The exact condition in which the glass is most suitable for bending can  only be learned by making a few trials. If it is too soft in consequence  of being overheated, the sides will collapse. If, in the endeavour to  heat the side _A_ of Fig. 7 a little more than _B_, _B_ is  insufficiently heated, the tube will be likely to break on the convex  side _B_. If the bent tube be likely to become flattened, and this  cannot always be prevented in bending very thin tubes, the fault may be  avoided by blowing gently into one end of the tube whilst bending it,  for which purpose the other end should be closed beforehand. A tube  already flattened may, to some extent, be blown into shape after  closing "]]]
