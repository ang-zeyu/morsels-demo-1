All the pent-up and natural enthusiasm of years was fairly bubbling to  her lips; all the long-suppressed necessity of speech with one of her  own kind who was not of her own kin.    It seemed as though they conversed and exchanged views on every topic  which concerned heaven and earth, flashing from one subject to another  which had nothing at all to do with anything yet discussed.    Out around them the flat leagues of water turned glassy and calm as a  millpond; the ducks and geese were asleep on their stools; even old  Uncle Dudley stood sentinel, with one leg buried in the downy plumage of  his belly, but his weather eye remained brilliantly open to any stir in  the blue vault above.    [Illustration: \"They ate their luncheon there together.\"]    They ate their luncheon there together, he serving her with hot coffee  from the vacuum bottle, she plying him with sandwiches.    And now, to her beauty was added an adorable friendliness and  confidence, free from the slightest taint of self-consciousness or the  least blemish of coquetry. Intelligent, yet modest to the verge of  shyness, eager yet reserved, warm hearted yet charmingly impersonal with  him, he realized that she was finding, with him, only the happiness of  speech with mankind in the abstract. And so she poured out to him her  heart, long stifled in the abyss of her isolation; and, gazing into his  eyes, she was gazing merely toward all that was bright and happy and  youthful and responsive, and he was its symbol, God-sent from those busy  haunts of men which already, to her, had become only memories of a  blessed vision.    And all the while the undercurrent of his own thoughts ran on  unceasingly: \"What can I do for her? I am falling in love--in love,  surely, hopelessly. What can I do for her--for her brother--her father?  I am falling in love--in love--in love.\"    The long, still, sunny afternoon slipped away. Gradually the water  turned to pearl, inlaid with gold, then with glowing rose. And now, far  to the north, the first thrilling clangor of wild geese, high in the  blue, came to their ears, and they shrank apart and lay back, staring  upward. Nearer, nearer, came the sky trumpets, answering faintly each to  each--nearer, nearer, till high over the blind swept the misty wedge;  and old Uncle Dudley flapped his wings and stretched his neck, calling  up to his wild comrades of earthly delights unnumbered here under the  shadow of death. And every wild goose answered him, and the decoys  flapped and clamored a siren welcome; but the flying wedge glided onward  through the blue.    \"They've begun to move,\" whispered the girl. \"But, oh, dear! It is  blue-bird weather. Hark! Do you hear the swans? I can hear swans coming  out of the north!\"    Marche could not yet hear them, but the tethered swans and geese heard,  and a magnificent chorus rose from the water. Then, far away as  fairyland, faintly out of the sky, came a new murmur--not the martial  clangor of wild geese, but something wilder, more exquisitely  unearthly--nearer, nearer, enrapturing its weird, celestial beauty. And  now, through the blue, with great, snowy wings slowly beating, the swans  passed over like angels; and like angels passing, hailing each other as  they winged their way, drifting on broad, white pinions, they called,  each to the other in their sweet, unreal voices, gossiping, garrulous,  high in the sky. And far away they floated on until they became only a  silver ribbon undulating against the azure; and even then Marche could  hear the soft tumult of their calling: Heu! Heu! Hiou! Hiou-oo! until  sound and snowy flecks vanished together in mid-heaven.    Again, coming from the far north, the trumpets of the sky squadron were  sounding; they passed, wedge after wedge, sometimes in steady formation,  sometimes like a wavering band of witches, and again in shifting  battalions, sternly officered, passing through intricate aerial  maneuvers, and greeted by Uncle Dudley and the other decoys with wild  beseeching mixed with applause.    Snowy, angelic companies of swans came alternately with the geese; then  a whimpering, whispering flight of wild ducks, water-fowl in thousands  and tens of thousands, rushing onward through the aerial lanes.    But none came to the blind. Occasionally a wedge of geese wavered,  irresolute at the frantic persuasions of Uncle Dudley, but their leader  always dragged them back to their course, and the sagging, hesitating  ranks passed on.    Sometimes, in a nearer flight of swans, some long-necked, snowy creature  would bend its head to look curiously down at the tethered swans on the  water, but always they continued on, settling some two miles south of  Foaming Shoals, until there was half a mile of wild swans afloat there,  looking like a long, low bank of snow, touched with faintest pink by the  glow of the westering sun.          IV      Marche, pacing the shabby sitting room after supper, an unlighted  cigarette between his fingers, listened to Jim recite his Latin lesson.    \"_Atque ea qui ad efeminandos animos pertinent important_,\" repeated the  boy; and Marche nodded absently.    \"Do you understand what that means, Jim?\"    \"Not exactly, sir.\"    Marche explained, then added smilingly: \"But there is nothing luxurious  to corrupt manhood among the coast marshes down here. Barring fever and  moccasins, Jim, you ought to emerge, some day, into the larger world  equipped for trouble.\"    \"I shall go out some day,\" said the boy.    Marche glanced up at the portrait of the boy's mother in its pale-gilt  oval. Near it, another nail had been driven, and on the faded wall paper  was an oval discoloration, as though another picture had once hung  there.    \"I wish I might see your father before I go North,\" said Marche, half to  himself. \"Isn't he well enough to let me talk to him for a few minutes?\"    \"I will ask him,\" said the boy.    Marche paced the ragged carpet until the return of Jimmy.    \"Father is sorry, and asks you to please excuse him,\" he said.    Marche had picked up the boy's schoolbook and was looking at the writing  on the flyleaf again. Then he raised his head, eyes narrowing on the boy  as though searching for some elusive memory connected with him--with his  name in the Latin book--perhaps with the writing, which, somehow, had  stirred in him, once more, the same odd and uncomfortable sensation  which he had experienced when he first saw it.    [Illustration: \"'Jim,' he said, 'where did you live?'\"]    \"Jim,\" he said, \"where did you live when you lived in New York?\"    \"In Eighty-seventh Street.\"    \"West?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Do you remember the house--the number?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Was it a private house?\"    \"I don't know. It was very tall. We lived on one floor and used an  elevator.\"    \"I see. It was an apartment house.\"    The boy stood, with blonde head lowered, silently turning over the  leaves of an old magazine.    Marche walked out to the porch; his brows were bent slightly inward, and  he bit the end of his unlighted cigarette until the thing became  useless. Then he flung it away. A few stars watched him above the black  ramparts of the pines; a gentle wind was abroad, bringing inland the  restless voice of the sea.    In Marche's mind a persistent thought was groping in darkness, vainly  striving to touch and awaken memories of things forgotten. What was it  he was trying to remember? What manner of episode, and how connected  with this place, with the boy's book, with the portrait of his mother in  its oval frame? Had he seen that portrait before? Perhaps he had seen it  here, five years ago; yet that could not be, because Herold had not been  here then.    Was it the writing on the flyleaf that had stirred some forgotten  memory? It had seemed to him familiar, somehow--yet not like the  handwriting in Herold's business letters to him. Yet it _was_ Herold's  writing--\"Jim, from Daddy\"--that was the inscription. And that  inscription had riveted his attention from the first moment he saw it.    Who was Herold? Who was this man whose undoubtable breeding and personal  cultivation had stamped his children with the same unmistakable  distinction?    Somehow or other there had been a great fall in the world for him--a  terrible tumble from higher estate to land him here in this desolation  of swamp-bound silence--here where only the dark pines broke the vast  sky line, where the only sound was the far rumor of the sea. Sick,  probably with coast fever, poor, dependent, no doubt, on the salary  Marche paid him, isolated from all in the world that made the world  endurable to intelligence, responsible for two growing children--one  already a woman--what must be the thoughts of such a man on a night like  this, for instance?    \"I want to see that man,\" he kept repeating to himself. \"I want to see  him; and I'm going to.\"    Restless, but now always listening for the sound of a light tread which  he had come to know so well--alas!--he began to walk to and fro, with  keen glances toward the illuminated kitchen window every time he passed  it. Sometimes his mind was chaotic; sometimes clear. The emotions which  had awakened in him within the week were complex enough to stagger a  more intelligent man. And Marche was not a fool; he was the typical  product of his environment--the result of school and college, and a New  York business life carried on in keenest competition with men as  remorseless in business as the social code permitted. Also, he went to  church on Sundays, read a Republican newspaper, and belonged to several  unexceptionable clubs.    That was the kind of a man he had been only a week ago--a good fellow in  the usual sense among men, acceptable to women, kind hearted, not too  cynical, and every idea in his head modeled upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2439"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,"afternoon, and in Ireland and the Highlands  of Scotland on the morrow. In our age, therefore, the stages of  legislation, the rules of debate, the tactics of faction, the opinions,  temper, and style of every active member of either House, are familiar  to hundreds of thousands. Every man who now enters Parliament possesses  what, in the seventeenth century, would have been called a great stock  of parliamentary knowledge. Such knowledge was then to be obtained only  by actual parliamentary service. The difference between an old and a new  member was as great as the difference between a veteran soldier and a  recruit just taken from the plough; and James's Parliament contained  a most unusual proportion of new members, who had brought from their  country seats to Westminster no political knowledge and many violent  prejudices. These gentlemen hated the Papists, but hated the Whigs not  less intensely, and regarded the King with superstitious veneration. To  form an opposition out of such materials was a feat which required the  most skilful and delicate management. Some men of great weight, however,  undertook the work, and performed it with success. Several experienced  Whig politicians, who had not seats in that Parliament, gave useful  advice and information. On the day preceding that which had been fixed  for the debate, many meetings were held at which the leaders instructed  the novices; and it soon appeared that these exertions had not been  thrown away. [17]    The foreign embassies were all in a ferment. It was well understood  that a few days would now decide the great question, whether the King  of England was or was not to be the vassal of the King of France. The  ministers of the House of Austria were most anxious that James should  give satisfaction to his Parliament. Innocent had sent to London two  persons charged to inculcate moderation, both by admonition and by  example. One of them was John Leyburn, an English Dominican, who had  been secretary to Cardinal Howard, and who, with some learning and  a rich vein of natural humour, was the most cautious, dexterous, and  taciturn of men. He had recently been consecrated Bishop of Adrumetum,  and named Vicar Apostolic in Great Britain. Ferdinand, Count of Adda, an  Italian of no eminent abilities, but of mild temper and courtly manners,  had been appointed Nuncio. These functionaries were eagerly welcomed by  James. No Roman Catholic Bishop had exercised spiritual functions in the  island during more than half a century. No Nuncio had been received here  during the hundred and twenty-seven years which had elapsed since the  death of Mary. Leyburn was lodged in Whitehall, and received a pension  of a thousand pounds a year. Adda did not yet assume a public character.  He passed for a foreigner of rank whom curiosity had brought to London,  appeared daily at court, and was treated with high consideration. Both  the Papal emissaries did their best to diminish, as much as possible,  the odium inseparable from the offices which they filled, and to  restrain the rash zeal of James. The Nuncio, in particular, declared  that nothing could be more injurious to the interests of the Church of  Rome than a rupture between the King and the Parliament. [18]    Barillon was active on the other side. The instructions which he  received from Versailles on this occasion well deserve to be studied;  for they furnish a key to the policy systematically pursued by his  master towards England during the twenty years which preceded our  revolution. The advices from Madrid, Lewis wrote, were alarming. Strong  hopes were entertained there that James would ally himself closely  with the House of Austria, as soon as he should be assured that his  Parliament would give him no trouble. In these circumstances, it was  evidently the interest of France that the Parliament should prove  refractory. Barillon was therefore directed to act, with all possible  precautions against detection, the part of a makebate. At court he was  to omit no opportunity of stimulating the religious zeal and the kingly  pride of James; but at the same time it might be desirable to have some  secret communication with the malecontents. Such communication would  indeed be hazardous and would require the utmost adroitness; yet it  might perhaps be in the power of the Ambassador, without committing  himself or his government, to animate the zeal of the opposition for the  laws and liberties of England, and to let it be understood that those  laws and liberties were not regarded by his master with an unfriendly  eye. [19]    Lewis, when he dictated these instructions, did not foresee how speedily  and how completely his uneasiness would be removed by the obstinacy and  stupidity of James. On the twelfth of November the House of Commons,  resolved itself into a committee on the royal speech. The Solicitor  General Heneage Finch, was in the chair. The debate was conducted by  the chiefs of the new country party with rare tact and address. No  expression indicating disrespect to the Sovereign or sympathy for rebels  was suffered to escape. The western insurrection was always mentioned  with abhorrence. Nothing was said of the barbarities of Kirke and  Jeffreys. It was admitted that the heavy expenditure which had been  occasioned by the late troubles justified the King in asking some  further supply: but strong objections were made to the augmentation of  the army and to the infraction of the Test Act.    The subject of the Test Act the courtiers appear to have carefully  avoided. They harangued, however, with some force on the great  superiority of a regular army to a militia. One of them tauntingly  asked whether the defence of the kingdom was to be entrusted to  the beefeaters. Another said that he should be glad to know how the  Devonshire trainbands, who had fled in confusion before Monmouth's  scythemen, would have faced the household troops of Lewis. But these  arguments had little effect on Cavaliers who still remembered with  bitterness the stern rule of the Protector. The general feeling was  forcibly expressed by the first of the Tory country gentlemen of  England, Edward Seymour. He admitted that the militia was not in a  satisfactory state, but maintained that it might be remodelled. The  remodelling might require money; but, for his own part, he would rather  give a million to keep up a force from which he had nothing to fear,  than half a million to keep up a force of which he must ever be afraid.  Let the trainbands be disciplined; let the navy be strengthened; and the  country would be secure. A standing army was at best a mere drain on the  public resources. The soldier was withdrawn from all useful labour. He  produced nothing: he consumed the fruits of the industry of other men;  and he domineered over those by whom he was supported. But the nation  was now threatened, not only with a standing army, but with a Popish  standing army, with a standing army officered by men who might be  very amiable and honourable, but who were on principle enemies to the  constitution of the realm. Sir William Twisden, member for the county of  Kent, spoke on the same side with great keenness and loud applause. Sir  Richard Temple, one of the few Whigs who had a seat in that Parliament,  dexterously accommodating his speech to the temper of his audience,  reminded the House that a standing army had been found, by experience,  to be as dangerous to the just authority of princes as to the liberty  of nations. Sir John Maynard, the most learned lawyer of his time, took  part in the debate. He was now more than eighty years old, and could  well remember the political contests of the reign of James the First. He  had sate in the Long Parliament, and had taken part with the Roundheads,  but had always been for lenient counsels, and had laboured to bring  about a general reconciliation. His abilities, which age had not  impaired, and his professional knowledge, which had long overawed all  Westminster Hall, commanded the ear of the House of Commons. He, too,  declared himself against the augmentation of the regular forces.    After much debate, it was resolved that a supply should be granted to  the crown; but it was also resolved that a bill should be brought in for  making the militia more efficient. This last resolution was tantamount  to a declaration against the standing army. The King was greatly  displeased; and it was whispered that, if things went on thus, the  session would not be of long duration. [20]    On the morrow the contention was renewed. The language of the country  party was perceptibly bolder and sharper than on the preceding day.  That paragraph of the King's speech which related to supply preceded the  paragraph which related to the test. On this ground Middleton proposed  that the paragraph relating to supply should be first considered in  committee. The opposition moved the previous question. They contended  that the reasonable and constitutional practice was to grant no money  till grievances had been redressed, and that there would be an end of  this practice if the House thought itself bound servilely to follow the  order in which matters were mentioned by the King from the throne.    The division was taken on the question whether Middletons motion should  be put. The Noes were ordered by the Speaker to go forth into the lobby.  They resented this much, and complained loudly of his servility and  partiality: for they conceived that, according to the intricate and  subtle rule which was then in force, and which, in our time, was  superseded by a more rational and convenient practice, they were  entitled to keep their seats; and it was held by all the Parliamentary  tacticians of that age that the party which stayed in the House had an  advantage over the party which went out; for the accommodation on the  benches was then so deficient that no person who had been fortunate  enough"]]]
