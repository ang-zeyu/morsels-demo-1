The sex of  the young Rouens can, however, be told by the difference in the color of  the bills.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. Upper--Rouen Drake.

In the fall the drake again assumes the normal male  plumage. Lower--Rouen Duck. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal  Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _The Cayuga._ The Cayuga is much like the other breeds of the meat  class in general type or shape of body showing good length, breadth and  depth. It is a very solid duck and weighs heavier than it looks. The  body carriage is slightly more upright than the Rouen but not so much so  as the Pekin. The back line should be straight and any tendency toward  an arched back must be avoided. It is slightly smaller than the Pekin,  Aylesbury and Rouen, averaging about a pound less.    In making the mating, size is important and breeders should be selected  which are up to standard weights if possible. While this breed is not  kept very widely at the present time, nevertheless it is an excellent  market duck, dressing out into a very plump yellow carcass in spite of  its black plumage which is a disadvantage in dressing. The color should  be a lustrous greenish black throughout, being somewhat brighter in the  drake than in the duck. The duck is more likely to show a brownish cast  of plumage, particularly as she grows older. It is hard to hold good  black color with age. Moreover, white or gray is apt to occur in the  breast of females. With age also a little white sometimes develops on  the back of the neck, around the eyes and underneath the neck at the  base of the bill. The white which occurs in breast is more likely to  come in ducks and is not commonly found in the drakes. In the drakes on  the other hand, there is a tendency for the white to come on the throat  under the bill.    Drakes as a rule run truer in color and hold their color better than  do the ducks. Where the white mottling occurs in plumage with age one  need not hesitate to breed from these birds if they were of good black  color as young birds. The drakes of the best color do not as a rule fade  or become mottled to any great extent with age. It is necessary to guard  against birds as breeders which have a rusty brown lacing on the breast  and under the wings, also those which have a wing-bow laced with brown.  There is a tendency for the bill of drakes, which should be black, to be  too light or olive in color and this tendency increases with age. Drakes  with bills of this color should be avoided as breeders. When Cayugas are  first hatched the baby ducks all show a white breast.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Upper--Cayuga Duck. Lower--Cayuga Drake.  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _The Call._ The Call ducks are the bantams of the duck race. There is  always a tendency for them to grow too large and this is especially true  when they have an opportunity to eat all they want as for example when  they are fed with the larger ducks. They should not be fed too liberally  and should be given wheat or some other solid grain rather than any  mash. If there is a good pond of water to which the Call ducks can have  access they do not need to be fed much of anything.    In breeding, the smallest individuals which are suitable in other  respects for breeders, should be selected in order to keep down the size  and offset the tendency to breed larger in successive generations. In  type the Calls are practically miniature Pekins except that they should  have a very short, rather broad head and bill. The broad flat and short  bill and the round short head give the head an appearance which is often  described by the term \"button headed\". In this breed avoid birds which  show arched backs. The body should have what is known as a flatiron  shape, that is, should be broad at the shoulders and taper toward the  tail. Too deep keels and narrow shoulders should be avoided as should  also too long bills. Call ducks, together with East Indias and Mallards  should have their wings clipped or be pinioned, that is, have the first  joint of one wing cut off, to prevent them from flying away.    _The Gray Call._ The plumage of the Gray Call is practically that of the  Rouen although they are not quite as good in color as a breed. There is  more of a tendency for some of the birds to run to dark and others,  especially the males, to run too light in color. While they are likely  to be well penciled the shade of color is apt to be wrong. White in the  flights and under the wings must be guarded against as must also absence  of ribbon or wing bar in females. The color of the plumage is likely to  fade with age but after the birds moult and secure their new plumage,  the color is usually higher again. In general the same color  characteristics hold true as with the Rouen and the same defects must be  guarded against.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Upper--Gray Call Drake. Lower--Gray Call Duck.  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture_.)]    _The White Call._ This variety is, both in type and color, practically a  miniature Pekin except for the short, rather broad head and bill.  They breed very true in color and should be free from creaminess. The  same general defects must be watched for and avoided as in the Pekin.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. Upper--White Call Duck. Lower--White Call Drake.  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _The Black East India._ This is a black breed which is small in size  being a bantam duck like the Call. As a matter of fact it is a miniature  Cayuga. The color should be black throughout and the same color  characteristics hold true as in the case of the Cayuga. The same color  defects must therefore be guarded against, the worst one being white in  the breast of females especially. Avoid breeding from a drake with a  black bill as in this respect the breed differs from the Cayuga since  the bill of the duck should be black but that of the drake should be  very dark green. Purple barring must be carefully selected against.    _The Muscovy._ This breed differs in certain respects very markedly from  the other standard breeds of ducks. They are long and broad in body  which is carried in a horizontal position but are not so deep in keel as  the Pekin, Aylesbury or Rouen. The longest bodied young ducks will make  the largest individuals. The head should have feathers on the top which  can be elevated at will to form a crest. Guard against breeders having  smooth heads, or in other words, lacking a crest. The face is covered  with corrugations or caruncles and should be red in color. At the base  of the upper bill there is a sort of knob-like formation in the drake  which serves as one of the distinguishing characteristics between the  duck and drake of this breed. The more prominent the knob and the more  wrinkled or corrugated the face the better is the specimen in this  respect. The wings are long and strong and these birds fly very well.  They will also climb fences. The drakes are quite pugnacious and fight  one another badly at times. They are especially pugnacious when they  have young.    This breed of ducks will often roost on roosts like chickens or in the  trees or on the barn. They do not quack like other ducks and unlike  other domesticated breeds which moult two or three times a year, they  moult only once, taking longer to do so, usually about 90 days, although  the female may complete her moult a little sooner. The period of  incubation for Muscovy eggs is longer, being from 33 to 35 days as  compared to 28 days for other breeds. In size the male and female differ  considerably as will be seen from the standard weights given (See Page  14), the male being considerably larger. These ducks lay well, the  fertility runs good, the eggs hatch well, and the little ducks are hardy  and easily raised. They are a broody breed. The ducks will make their  nests and hatch out their eggs if allowed to do so and are excellent  mothers. Sometimes they will fly up and make their nests in a hollow  tree. A Muscovy duck can cover properly about 20 eggs. In spite of the  fact that they fly well they are easily domesticated. It takes about  two years for the males of this breed to fully mature although the ducks  get their full size when one year of age. The Muscovy is perhaps the  best general purpose breed for a farm flock.    The extent and intensity of the red of the face increases up to maturity  and the redder the face the better. The plumage of the Muscovy is not as  downy or oily as other breeds, the feathers being harder. For this  reason the birds are more apt to become water soaked and to drown as a  result when they have not been accustomed to water in which to swim.  This is especially true of the drakes on account of their large size and  long wing feathers. Muscovy ducks dress well, having a rich yellow skin,  and therefore make a good market duck, although the difference in size  of the duck and drake and the dark pin feathers of the Colored variety  are disadvantages from a market standpoint. Select against breeders  which run small in size as there is more or less of a tendency for this  breed to decrease in size. The Muscovy is long lived, specimens having  been known to breed until they were eight or ten years of age.    _The Colored Muscovy._ Although the standard calls for more or less"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33044"],[0,"Birds from North Borneo (#6)"],[1,"=_ (Gmelin): Watercock.--_Specimen_, 1: Tiger  Estate: sex?, December 17, 1962 (taken on dry grassland).    _=Squatarola squatarola=_ (Linnaeus): Black-bellied Plover.--On  September 2 I saw a flock of 12 plovers on the Tawau golf course. They  were in a mottled plumage indicating extensive molt and feather growth.  Later in the day a bird in almost complete breeding plumage flew  overhead.    _=Charadrius peroni=_ Schlegel: Malay Sand Plover.--On September 15, one  was sitting on the Tawau Airport runway. Another was observed on  November 20, feeding near a water buffalo wallow on the Brantian Estate.  Smythies (1960:191) lists sandy beaches as the only habitat.    _=Charadrius leschenaulti=_ Lesson: Large Sand Plover.--On September 16  one was sitting on the Tawau Airport runway.    _=Numenius phaeopus variegatus=_ (Scopoli): Whimbrel.--_Specimen_, 1:  Karindingen Island: [Male], November 24, 1962, MCT 3315.         This was the most common curlew around Karindingen Island on       November 24. Flocks of 10 to 20 individuals were feeding on the       coral sand around the island, and a few individuals were sitting in       the tops of dead mangroves at low tide.    _=Numenius arquata=_ (Linnaeus): Common Curlew.--On November 24, a  Common Curlew flew from Karindingen Island toward the mainland.    _=Numenius madagascariensis=_ (Linnaeus): Eastern Curlew.--I first  observed this curlew on August 17 at Karindingen Island, where 50 were  feeding on the coral sand. At that time it was the most abundant  shorebird. When I returned to the island on November 24, several were  seen around the island, but the species was not so abundant as _N.  phaeopus_.    _=Limosa lapponica=_ (Linnaeus): Bar-tailed Godwit.--A flock of five was  observed at Karindingen Island on November 24.    _=Tringa totanus eurhinus=_ (Oberholser): Redshank.--_Specimens_, 2:  Karindingen Island: [Female], November 24, 1962, MCT 3312; [Female],  November 24, 1962, MCT 3313.         On August 17, this bird was common and feeding on the coral sand at       Karindingen Island. When I revisited the island on November 24 the       Redshank seemed to prefer the mangrove areas for feeding and was       the most common wader.    _=Tringa ochropus=_ Linnaeus: Green Sandpiper.--_Specimen_, 1: Brantian  Estate: [Female], November 19, 1962, MCT 3305.         The specimen, one of three or four birds seen, was taken near a       grassland pond.    _=Heteroscelus incanum=_ (Gmelin): Wandering Tattler.--One was feeding  along a sandy beach and later on rocks on Siamil Island on September 18,  1962.    _=Capella megala=_ (Swinhoe): Swinhoe's Snipe.--_Specimens_, 3: Tiger  Estate: sex?, December 9, 1962; sex?, December 9, 1962. Pintasan  Agriculture Station: [Male], October 17, 1963, ADG 317.         These three specimens lend support to the theory of Smythies       (1960:206) that this species is the common snipe of North Borneo.    _=Calidris canutus=_ (Linnaeus): Knot.--On August 17, I saw 20 Knots  feeding on the coral sand at Karindingen Island. They were still partly  in breeding feather, showing rusty color here and there on the breast. I  saw no Knots on November 24 at Karindingen Island. There is but one  prior record for Borneo, from the North Natuna Islands (Chasen,  1935:39).    _=Erolia ruficollis=_ (Pallas): Red-necked Stint.--_Specimen_, 1:  Karindingen Island: [Male], November 24, 1962, MCT 3314.         The species was common on November 24 around Karindingen Island,       usually in flocks of 5 to 10 birds.    _=Glareola pratincola=_ (Linnaeus): Collared Pratincole.--_Specimen_, 1:  Tiger Estate: [Male], April 28, 1963, ADG 75.    _=Chlidonias hybrida=_ (Pallas): Whiskered Tern.--_Specimen_, 1: Kuala  Sumawang: sex?, September 18, 1962, ADG 280.         Smythies (1960:217) lists no record for North Borneo.    _=Sterna bergii=_ Lichtenstein: Greater Crested Tern.--_Specimens_, 2:  Kuala Sumawang: [Female], September 18, 1963, ADG 278; [Male], September  18, 1963, ADG 279.         This tern was observed several times off the coast of North Borneo       near Tawau.    _=Treron curvirostra curvirostra=_ (Gmelin): Thick-billed  Pigeon.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 9 x 5  mm., 166.7 gm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2693; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., 167.2  gm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2694; [Male] testis 13 x 6 mm., 167.8 gm.,  August 1, 1962, MCT 2695; [Male] testis 9 x 5 mm., 155.5 gm., August 1,  1962, MCT 2700; [Female], 112.9 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT 2712; [Male],  185.8 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT 2713; [Female], 135.4 gm., growing new  5th primary, August 25, 1962, MCT 2806; [Female], 132.2 gm., August 31,  1962, MCT 2842; [Male], 112.5 gm., August 31, 1962, MCT 2843.         This pigeon was the most common bird eating wild figs (_Ficus_) in       the communal feeding trees, where there were as many as 30 gathered       in one tree to feed. While resting, individual birds commonly       dipped their tails.    _=Treron olax olax=_ (Temminck): Little Green Pigeon.--_Specimens_, 2:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 11 x 5 mm., September 1, 1962, MCT  2844. Pintasan Agriculture Station: [Male], October 14, 1963, ADG 306.         The species was seen only once. At the Cocoa Research Station, one       bird sat on a dead tree and fed on a red berry from a vine. The       call resembled the crying of a child. Others called in the cocoa.       The bird taken had testes of a size indicating possible breeding       condition.    _=Treron vernans purpurea=_ (Gmelin): Pink-necked Green  Pigeon.--_Specimens_, 10: Tiger Estate: [Male], November 25, 1962, MCT  3323; [Female], November 25, 1962, MCT 3325.

Mt. Rumas: [Female], March  6, 1963, ADG 11. Tuaran: [Female], November 29, 1963, SCFC 34.         The species was confined to the lowlands around Tawau, as at the       Tawau Airport in the scrub growth. Flocks of 50 to 100 were       observed at Tuaran. None of the specimens taken in November was in       breeding condition.    _=Ducula bicolor=_ (Scopoli): Pied Imperial Pigeon.--I observed this  pigeon on September 18 and 19 at Siamil Island. On the first day two  were seen in the few remaining trees on the island and on September 19 a  flock of 12 flew southwest over the island at about 8:30 A. M.    _=Streptopelia bitorquata=_ (Temminck): Javanese Turtle Dove.--On Siamil  Island on September 18 and 19, two were seen at close range feeding  with 10 _S. chinensis_. There is only one other record from Borneo;  Pryer took one at Sandakan in the 1880's (Everett, 1889:193) and it has  not been recorded since. Chasen (1935:22) speculated that the Javanese  Turtle Dove was introduced to Borneo as a cage bird. But, Borneo is  seemingly well within the normal range of the species and probably it is  a resident of North Borneo. The Javanese Turtle Dove and the  Spotted-necked Dove, _S. chinensis_, closely resemble each other; this  resemblance may help to account for the lack of records of _S.  bitorquata_.    _=Streptopelia chinensis=_ (Scopoli): Spotted-necked Dove.--_Specimens_,  2: Tiger Estate: [Male], June 19, 1963, ADG 149. Telipok: [Male],  February 10, 1963, TM 34.         This is a common bird of the coconut groves around Tawau and on       Siamil Island.    _=Chalcophaps indica=_ (Linnaeus): Emerald Dove.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa  Research Station: [Male], June 17, 1963, ADG 146.         Birds, always solitary, of this species often were seen in the       cocoa groves at the Cocoa Research Station.    _=Tanygnathus lucionensis lucionensis=_ (Linnaeus): Blue-naped  Parrot.--_Specimens_, 3: Siamil Island: [Male], September 19, 1962, MCT  2928; [Female], September 19, 1962, MCT 2929; [Female], September 19,  1962, MCT 2930.         These birds were seen on September 18 and 19. I saw flocks of 10 to       20 in the remnant of forest on the north side of the island. The       birds were almost entirely inhabitants of the forest and were       rarely seen in the coconut groves. I estimated the entire island       population to be between 30 and 100 birds. The Japanese residents       knew nothing of the birds, although they were aware of a cockatoo       (_Cacatua galerita_) that had lived at large on the island for       several years. The Blue-naped Parrot has been found only on the       Maratuas and on Mantanani Island. Smythies (1960:242) surmised that       the Mantanani population was introduced by sailing craft from the       Sulu Sea. In the light of the present discovery, I think the       species is a naturally-established resident of the North Bornean       islands.    _=Psittinus cyanurus cyanurus=_ (Forester): Little Malay  Parrot.--_Specimens_, 2: Tiger Estate: [Female], October 11, 1962, MCT  2998; [Male], October 11, 1962, MCT 2997.         Smythies (1963:277) was the first to record this species from North       Borneo. However, the Harvard Primate Expedition in 1938 took three       specimens as follows: [Male], Sandakan, June 6, 1937, MCZ 197123;       [Male], Morutai Besar, June 27, 1937, MCZ 197124; [Male], Kalabakan       River, July 16, 1937, MCZ 197125. The Harvard collection of birds       from North Borneo appears to have been overlooked, although it was       mentioned in passing by Smythies (1960:526). The specimens in my       collection were taken in the same general area where H. G. Deignan       took the Harvard specimens.    _=Loriculus galgulus=_ (Linnaeus): Malay Lorikeet.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa  Research Station: [Female], May 1, 1963, ADG 103.
