It was built of stone.  The walls were  of great thickness, as the stones were laid without mortar, with which,  however, it was faced inside and out.  One large room occupied the  greater portion of the ground floor; beside this was a small  sitting-room.  Upstairs were four bedrooms.  For the time the small room  downstairs was turned into a bedroom, which Mr and Mrs Humphreys  occupied.  The four bedrooms upstairs just held the rest of the party.  The out-houses consisted only of a large barn and a rough stable.    Mr Humphreys at once rode over to Newcastle, and obtained the services  of a mason and six Kaffirs, and proceeded to add a wing to the  farmhouse.  This was for the use of Johnson and his wife, and Harrison.  The whole party were, however, to take their meals together in the great  kitchen.  A hut was also built for the Kaffirs, and another large stable  was erected.    A few days after his arrival Mr Humphreys went across the border into  the Transvaal, taking Harrison and two of the Kaffirs with him, and  returned a fortnight later with a herd of 400 cattle, which he had  purchased.  He also bought three yoke of oxen, broken to the plough.  Hitherto the farm had been purely a pastoral one, but Mr Humphreys at  once began to break up some land for wheat and Indian corn.  The Kaffirs  were set to work to fence and dig up a plot round the house for  vegetables, and to dig holes near it, over a space of some acres, for  the reception of 3000 young fruit-trees--apples, pears, peaches, and  plums,--which he had bought at Pieter-Maritzburg, and which were to come  up in two months' time.  He also bought six riding-horses.    In a few weeks the farm assumed quite a different appearance.  A gang of  Kaffirs, ten strong, had been hired to hurry on the work of preparing  the orchard and erecting a fence round it.  Wood was, Mr Humphreys  found, extremely scarce and dear, the country being absolutely bare of  trees, and wood for fuel was only obtained in kloofs or deep hollows,  and had to be fetched long distances.    \"I suppose,\" Mrs Humphreys said to her husband one evening, \"you mean  to make cattle-raising your principal point?\"    \"No,\" he said; \"every one raises cattle, and the Dutch can do it cheaper  than we can; they have immense tracts of land, and their Kaffir labour  costs them next to nothing.  I do not say that we could not live and to  a certain extent thrive on cattle, but I think that there is something  much better to be done.  Wood is an awful price here, and all that is  used has to be brought up from the coast.  I think therefore of planting  trees.  The climate is magnificent, and their growth will be rapid.  They will of course require fencing to keep out the cattle, but I shall  do that, as I am doing the orchard, with wire fencing and light  iron-uprights.  Labour is plentiful, and there are large nurseries near  Pieter-Maritzburg, where I can procure any number of young trees; so I  mean to plant 200 acres a year--in ten years the whole farm will be  planted, and the loppings for poles and firewood will in a very short  time after planting begin to pay well.  In fifteen years the first 200  acres will be fit to fell, and the property will be worth a very large  sum of money.  Of course we can sell out before that if we like.  But at  the present price of wood up here, or even should it fall to a quarter  of its present price, the value of the 2000 acres of wood will in twenty  years be extremely large.\"    The boys were delighted with their new life.  Mr Humphreys had, before  leaving England, bought for Dick a Winchester repeating-rifle.  These  arms are very light, and Dick was able to carry his without difficulty;  and very shortly after their arrival his father had a mark erected at a  distance from the house, at which he could practise with safety.  Game  was abundant all over the country.  Herds of deer and antelope of  various kinds often swept past in sight of the farmhouse, and winged  game also abounded.    Mr Humphreys had at home been considered a first-rate shot at  partridges, and had for four or five years belonged to the Castleton  volunteers, and had carried off many prizes for rifle-shooting.  He was  now able, by going out for a few hours once or twice a week, to keep the  larder well supplied, and the little flock of fifty sheep, which he had  bought for home-consumption, was but seldom drawn upon.  The Kaffirs  were fed upon mealies, as they call Indian corn, of which Mr Humphreys  had no difficulty in purchasing sufficient for his wants from the  neighbouring farmers.    His next neighbours were two brothers, Scotchmen, named Fraser, who  lived at a distance of four miles.  They rode over the day after the  travellers' arrival, and offered their services in any way.  Mr  Humphreys, however, was well supplied with stores of all kinds, and his  two white labourers, being both handy men, were able to do all that was  required about the house.    The Frasers proved pleasant neighbours, and often rode over and spent  Sunday with the Humphreys, and the boys sometimes went over and spent  the day with them.    A Kaffir lad, son of one of the men engaged upon the farm, was hired by  Mr Humphreys as a special attendant for Dick.  On these vast undulating  plains, where there are no trees to serve as a landmark, it is  exceedingly difficult for a stranger to find his way.  Dick was told by  his father that, whether riding or walking, he was always to take the  Kaffir boy with him; and except when he was indulging in a gallop the  lad was easily able to keep up with him.  He had been born a hunter, and  soon taught Dick how to stalk the timid deer, and, as the lad improved  in his shooting, he was ere long enabled to keep the larder supplied--a  duty which Mr Humphreys gladly handed over to him, as every minute of  his own time was occupied by his work on the farm.    Of an evening after supper, which was partaken of at the conclusion of  work, the men retired to their own wing and Mrs Humphreys and the two  girls sat down to their sewing by the fire; for upon the uplands the  evenings are quite cold enough to find a fire a comfort in winter.  Then  the boys would take out their lesson-books and work steadily for three  hours.  Under the changed conditions of their life, Mr Humphreys felt  that Dick might, if he chose, well discontinue his study of the  classics, and his work therefore consisted in the reading of history,  travels, and books of scientific knowledge.    \"Next to being a learned man,\" his father said to him, \"the best and  most useful thing is to be a thoroughly well-informed man on all general  subjects.\"    John, however, continued his studies as before; his life of outdoor  exercise strengthened and improved him, and he no longer wished to be  always sitting with a book in his hand--still, he had a natural love of  study, which his father encouraged, deeming it possible that as he grew  up he might be unwilling to embrace the life of a colonist, in which  case he determined to send him home to finish his education in England,  and afterwards to start him in any profession he might select.    Finding that the cost of carriage up the country was very high, and as  he would yearly require many waggon-loads of young trees and fencing Mr  Humphreys determined to do his own teaming; he therefore bought two of  the large country-waggons and set a Kaffir to work to break in some  young steers to the yoke.    Six months after their arrival in the colony they had for the first time  visitors to stay at the farm--Mr Jackson, his wife, his son Tom, and  two daughters coming out to settle near them.  This was a great delight  to the boys, and fortunately Mr Jackson was able to buy a farm of 500  acres adjoining that of his friend; the house, however, was but a cabin,  and while a fresh one was being erected the family remained guests of  the Humphreys.  Mr Jackson had, at his friend's advice, brought with  him from England a labourer with his wife and family, who at once took  up their residence in the hut on the farm.    To Dick the coming of the Jacksons was a source of special pleasure.  Tom was just his own age, and the two boys had become inseparable  friends at home after their adventure in the snow, upon which occasion  Tom, as he freely owned, had owed his life to Dick's energy and  promptness of suggestion.  Dick was fond of his brother, but three years  make a great difference at this period of life, and, as their tastes  were wholly dissimilar, John had never been a companion for him.  Since  their arrival in South Africa they had got on very well together; still,  they had not the same ideas or subjects of thought, and it was an  immense delight to Dick to have his old friend and companion with him.    It must not be supposed that Dick's time was occupied solely in  amusement; from early morning until dinner-time he worked steadily.  Sometimes he assisted to erect the hurdles and strain the wires of the  fencing; at others he aided in the planting of the fruit-trees; then he  would be with the Kaffirs who were breaking in the oxen for the waggons.  At all times he took off his coat and worked with the rest, for, as his  father said--    \"If a farmer is to be able properly to look after men at work, he must  be able to do the work himself.\"    While Dick was at work with the men, John, who was too young to be of  any use, remained indoors at his books, and, although of an afternoon he  would stroll out, he seldom went far from the house.  The other boys  generally went for long rides when work was done.  One day they sighted  a herd of steinbock.  Leaving their horses with the Kaffir lad in a  hollow, they crept round so as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#6)"],[1,"that we can ever hope to  supplement our knowledge on this subject.      b.--The Respiratory Centre.    Paresis of this centre does not play as important a part here as it does  in India, more especially after cobra-bite. The peculiar, and as yet  unexplained, tendency of snake-poison to act with special virulence on  some centres, passing others by comparatively little disturbed, is  markedly shown by the cobra poison of India as compared with that of our  Australian cobra (_hoplocephalus curtus._) The unfortunate victims of  the former are tortured by an ever-increasing dyspnoca, and finally die  from asphyxia, under what are supposed to be carbonic acid convulsions.  They retain their consciousness more or less unclouded to the last, the  poison spending all its force on the respiratory centre, and leaving the  brain intact. Here we hardly ever see actual dyspnoca after the bite of  hoplocephalus or any other Australian snake. Respiration becomes quicker  at an early stage, and then, from hour to hour, shallower; but our  patients soon pass from sleep into coma, and suffer no respiratory  distress even when, in consequence of general paralysis, the respiratory  muscles cease to act, which usually takes place a few minutes before the  heart stands still.    Feoktistow records the following observations on cats with reference to  the respiratory centre:--Small intravenous injections of the fresh  poison (0.07-0.13 mllgr.) produced a great increase in frequency of  respirations (280-360 per minute). Section of both vagi at once reduced  this frequency, from which he infers that small doses act as an irritant  to the respiratory centre. When small doses were repeated several times,  the respiratory movements were gradually retarded, and asphyxia set in  through paralysis of the centre. Large doses produced this effect at  once, without any previous acceleration. Very large ones paralysed  respiration, heart, and vaso-motors almost simultaneously, and caused  the blood pressure to fall to 0. By the kymograph respirations were  found to become shallower in proportion to their frequency. As the  latter was reduced, they became at first deeper, but ere long shallower  again, and were occasionally interrupted by spasmodic inspirations.  Artificial respiration prolonged life for a short time only.      C.--Action on Centres of Cranial Nerves.    Among the symptoms denoting paresis of motor-centres of cranial nerves,  together with sympathetic ganglia, the first and most noteworthy is the  early dilatation of the pupil. This truly pathognomic condition is never  absent, and becomes intense when paresis becomes intensified into  paralysis. The most glaring light, in immediate proximity to the  eyeball, has then no effect whatever on the pupil. If it remains dilated  after strychnine injections have restored consciousness and the power to  walk, it is a sure sign that the snake-poison is not completely  counteracted, and will in all probability re-assert itself,  necessitating another injection, whilst a pupil restored to its normal  condition justifies the conclusion that the patient is safe.    Another symptom denoting paresis of the cranial nerve-centres is a  marked change in the expression of the face. The features become  relaxed, and lose their mimetic play. The cornea is dull, and, together  with the anterior surface of the eyeball, becomes dry, as the eyelids  are moved imperfectly, if at all, and the tears in consequence are not  properly distributed over the conjunctiva. The nostrils become more or  less immovable, and the naso-labial fold is obliterated, whilst the  lower lip hangs down. The lips are apart, as the lower jaw is not held  up by the muscles. When paralysis supervenes it drops entirely, and the  tongue protrudes.    Deglutition, somewhat difficult in paresis, is completely suspended in  the paralytic stage, through paralysis of the soft palate, the pharynx,  and oesophagus. Liquids forced on the patient in this extremity may  partly flow down the oesophagus, but will also enter the larynx, and  their administration should be carefully avoided.      D. Action on motor-centres of Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia.    Of this action little if anything is patent to observation. A certain  want of co-ordination in the movements has been noticed in the early  stage of paresis, and the peculiar staggering walk of persons in this  stage is probably owing to an affection of the motor-centres of the  cerebellum. That they do not escape the action of the subtle poison,  when symptoms denoting the invasion of all the other motor-centres  throughout the body are in evidence, we have every reason to assume.  The co-ordination and automatic regulation of the lower motor-centres  must necessarily escape observation when the function of these centres  is partially suspended, and when, moreover, the powerful currents of  nerve force the cerebellum and basal ganglia receive from the motor  cortical centres of the cerebrum are partially if not wholly withdrawn.      E. Action of the Motor Cortical Centres of the Cerebrum.    In all but the very lightest cases of snakebite-poisoning there are  always symptoms manifested that cannot be referred to any other cause  than an invasion of the centres now under consideration. They range from  mere stupor, confusion of thought and delirium to the deepest coma, with  complete extinction of consciousness and insensibility to all external  impressions. Coma is a frequent and in serious cases an almost  invariable symptom in Australia. After the bite of our death adder only  we find persons sometimes collapse and expire suddenly, when still  conscious and able to answer questions rationally. Coma invariably  develops from sleep. It is, in fact, sleep intensified. An almost  irresistible desire to sleep is one of the first symptoms to be  observed. If the dose of poison imparted by the snake has been small,  the desire may pass off or the sleep may not assume the form of coma,  but in all serious cases it quickly assumes that form. _Vice versa_ the  deepest coma becomes sleep again, when the suspended function of the  cortical centres is roused by strychnine injections. The insensible and  completely paralysed patient usually announces the gradual return of  consciousness by a few groans and uneasy movements and not unfrequently  begins to snore, as in ordinary sleep, when a smart shake at the  shoulder will rouse him into full consciousness. At other times this  transition from coma back to sleep does not take place and consciousness  returns quite suddenly, the persons opening their eyes and looking  around them, dazed and bewildered, but perfectly conscious at once. When  coma is fully established and the largest and most powerful  motor-centres have succumbed to the insidious poison, general paresis  becomes general paralysis and all the motor-centres of the body are in a  condition of more or less suspended functional activity. This and this  only is the condition of the centres, the whole secret of snake-poison,  that has puzzled the human mind for ages and yet appears so simple when  discovered at last. It is beautifully and strikingly illustrated in the  phenomena before us. We have coma and complete general paralysis, every  motor-nerve cell, from the highest psycho-motor one downwards, is thrown  into a state of torpor and has ceased to discharge the life force that  regulates every process of life and the entire absence of which  inevitably must be death. Only weak, lingering currents are sent forth  yet and put off the inevitable finale for a time. But the strychnine is  injected and mark the change. It courses quickly to every one of the  sleepers, for whom it also has an affinity, but the direct opposite to  that of the deadly venom that has overpowered them. It touches them as  if with the wand of a magician and orders them to awake and do their  work. There is no disobeying the mandate, for it is founded on one of  nature's unchangeable laws. Almost immediately the cells begin their  work again, the life streams flow afresh, coma and paralysis vanish and  within a very short time the subject of this beautiful experiment is  snatched from the brink of the grave and restored to life and health.    The phenomena of sleep and coma as the result of a poison acting as a  depressant of motor nerve force afford food for some interesting  speculations, which, however, as more concerning the psychologist, the  writer can only glance at here. It is evident that in the highest of  psycho-motor centres, the organs of thought and of consciousness, the  paresis of the lower centres assumes the form of sleep, and paralysis  that of coma. Sleep, as a partial, and coma, as a complete, obliteration  of thought and consciousness must, therefore, be intimately connected  with motor nerve function, sleep being a reduction, coma a suppression  of the function, or a suspension of thought. Ideation, to use J. S.  Mill's very appropriate term for the thought process, appears to be  effected by motor nerve currents or, at all events, to be accompanied by  them and suspended with their suspension. The thinking principle, the  nous within us, is no doubt more than mere nerve action, but it can,  apparently, not manifest its presence without motor nerve cells in  healthy action. Every thought, though not synonymous, is evidently  synchronous with a current of motor nerve force, and it is not  improbable that, by means of these currents, that silent transference of  thought is effected from brain to brain, which modern psychology has  demonstrated to be not only possible but actual under certain  conditions. But further speculation on these interesting mysteries it  would be out of place here to indulge in.      F. Action on Sensory Centres and the Reflexes.    The sensory sphere remains comparatively unaffected in mild cases, and  in the early stages of more serious ones, but when paresis"]]]
