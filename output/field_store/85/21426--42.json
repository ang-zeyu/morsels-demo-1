There was a valley between  us, and the bushes were so thick on both sides of our trail that it was  not possible at any time, until we met at Guasimas, to distinguish the  other column.    As soon as the Rough Riders had reached the top of the ridge, not twenty  minutes after they had left camp, which was the first opportunity that  presented itself, Colonel Wood ordered Captain Capron to proceed with his  troop in front of the column as an advance guard, and to choose a \"point\"  of five men skilled as scouts and trailers.  Still in advance of these he  placed two Cuban scouts.  The column then continued along the trail in  single file.  The Cubans were at a distance of two hundred and fifty  yards; the \"point\" of five picked men under Sergeant Byrne and  duty-Sergeant Fish followed them at a distance of a hundred yards, and  then came Capron's troop of sixty men strung out in single file.  No  flankers were placed for the reason that the dense undergrowth and the  tangle of vines that stretched from the branches of the trees to the  bushes below made it a physical impossibility for man or beast to move  forward except along the single trail.    Colonel Wood rode at the head of the column, followed by two regular army  officers who were members of General Wheeler's staff, a Cuban officer,  and Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt.  They rode slowly in consideration of  the troopers on foot, who under a cruelly hot sun carried heavy burdens.  To those who did not have to walk, it was not unlike a hunting excursion  in our West; the scenery was beautiful and the view down the valley one  of luxuriant peace.  Roosevelt had never been in the tropics and Captain  McCormick and I were talking back at him over our shoulders and at each  other, pointing out unfamiliar trees and birds.  Roosevelt thought it  looked like a good deer country, as it once was; it reminded McCormick of  Southern California; it looked to me like the trails in Central America.  We advanced, talking in that fashion and in high spirits, and  congratulating ourselves in being shut of the transport and on breathing  fine mountain air again, and on the fact that we were on horseback.  We  agreed it was impossible to appreciate that we were really at war--that  we were in the enemy's country.  We had been riding in this pleasant  fashion for an hour and a half with brief halts for rest, when Wood  stopped the head of the column, and rode down the trail to meet Capron,  who was coming back.  Wood returned immediately, leading his horse, and  said to Roosevelt:    \"Pass the word back to keep silence in the ranks.\"    The place at which we had halted was where the trail narrowed, and  proceeded sharply downward.  There was on one side of it a stout  barbed-wire fence of five strands.  By some fortunate accident this fence  had been cut just where the head of the column halted.  On the left of  the trail it shut off fields of high grass blocked at every fifty yards  with great barricades of undergrowth and tangled trees and chapparal.  On  the other side of the trail there was not a foot of free ground; the  bushes seemed absolutely impenetrable, as indeed they were later found to  be.    When we halted, the men sat down beside the trail and chewed the long  blades of grass, or fanned the air with their hats.  They had no  knowledge of the situation such as their leaders possessed, and their  only emotion was one of satisfaction at the chance the halt gave them to  rest and to shift their packs.  Wood again walked down the trail with  Capron and disappeared, and one of the officers informed us that the  scouts had seen the outposts of the enemy.  It did not seem reasonable  that the Spaniards, who had failed to attack us when we landed at  Baiquiri, would oppose us until they could do so in force, so,  personally, I doubted that there were any Spaniards nearer than Santiago.  But we tied our horses to the wire fence, and Capron's troop knelt with  carbines at the \"Ready,\" peering into the bushes.  We must have waited  there, while Wood reconnoitred, for over ten minutes.  Then he returned,  and began deploying his troops out at either side of the trail.  Capron  he sent on down the trail itself.  G Troop was ordered to beat into the  bushes on the right, and K and A were sent over the ridge on which we  stood down into the hollow to connect with General Young's column on the  opposite side of the valley.  F and E Troops were deployed in  skirmish-line on the other side of the wire fence.  Wood had discovered  the enemy a few hundred yards from where he expected to find him, and so  far from being \"surprised,\" he had time, as I have just described, to get  five of his troops into position before a shot was fired.  The firing,  when it came, started suddenly on our right.  It sounded so close  that--still believing we were acting on a false alarm, and that there  were no Spaniards ahead of us--I guessed it was Capron's men firing at  random to disclose the enemy's position.  I ran after G Troop under  Captain Llewellyn, and found them breaking their way through the bushes  in the direction from which the volleys came.  It was like forcing the  walls of a maze.  If each trooper had not kept in touch with the man on  either hand he would have been lost in the thicket.  At one moment the  underbrush seemed swarming with our men, and the next, except that you  heard the twigs breaking, and heavy breathing or a crash as a vine pulled  some one down, there was not a sign of a human being anywhere.  In a few  minutes we broke through into a little open place in front of a dark  curtain of vines, and the men fell on one knee and began returning the  fire that came from it.    The enemy's fire was exceedingly heavy, and his aim was excellent.  We  saw nothing of the Spaniards, except a few on the ridge across the  valley.  I happened to be the only one present with field glasses, and  when I discovered this force on the ridge, and had made sure, by the  cockades in their sombreros, that they were Spaniards and not Cubans, I  showed them to Roosevelt.  He calculated they were five hundred yards  from us, and ordered the men to fire on them at that range.  Through the  two hours of fighting that followed, although men were falling all around  us, the Spaniards on the ridge were the only ones that many of us saw.  But the fire against us was not more than eighty yards away, and so hot  that our men could only lie flat in the grass and return it in that  position.  It was at this moment that our men believed they were being  attacked by Capron's troop, which they imagined must have swung to the  right, and having lost its bearings and hearing them advancing through  the underbrush, had mistaken them for the enemy.  They accordingly ceased  firing and began shouting in order to warn Capron that he was shooting at  his friends.  This is the foundation for the statement that the Rough  Riders had fired on each other, which they did not do then or at any  other time.  Later we examined the relative position of the trail which  Capron held, and the position of G Troop, and they were at right angles  to one another.    Capron could not possibly have fired into us at any time, unless he had  turned directly around in his tracks and aimed up the very trail he had  just descended.  Advancing, he could no more have hit us than he could  have seen us out of the back of his head.  When we found many hundred  spent cartridges of the Spaniards a hundred yards in front of G Troop's  position, the question as to who had fired on us was answered.    It was an exceedingly hot corner.  The whole troop was gathered in the  little open place blocked by the network of grape-vines and tangled  bushes before it.  They could not see twenty feet on three sides of them,  but on the right hand lay the valley, and across it came the sound of  Young's brigade, who were apparently heavily engaged.  The enemy's fire  was so close that the men could not hear the word of command, and Captain  Llewellyn and Lieutenant Greenway, unable to get their attention, ran  among them, batting them with their sombreros to make them cease firing.  Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt ran up just then, bringing with him  Lieutenant Woodbury Kane and ten troopers from K Troop.  Roosevelt lay  down in the grass beside Llewellyn and consulted with him eagerly.  Kane  was smiling with the charming content of a perfectly happy man.  When  Captain Llewellyn told him his men were not needed, and to rejoin his  troop, he led his detail over the edge of the hill on which we lay.  As  he disappeared below the crest he did not stoop to avoid the bullets, but  walked erect, still smiling.  Roosevelt pointed out that it was  impossible to advance farther on account of the network of wild  grape-vines that masked the Spaniards from us, and that we must cross the  trail and make to the left.  The shouts the men had raised to warn Capron  had established our position to the enemy, and the firing was now  fearfully accurate.  Sergeant Russell, who in his day had been a colonel  on a governor's staff, was killed, and the other sergeant was shot  through the wrist.  In the space of three minutes nine men were lying on  their backs helpless.  Before we got away, every third man was killed, or  wounded.  We drew off slowly to the left, dragging the wounded with us.  Owing to the low aim of the enemy, we were forced to move on our knees  and crawl.  Even then men were hit.  One man near me was shot through the  head.  Returning later to locate the body and identify him, I found that  the buzzards had torn off his lips and his eyes.

Nearly every one readily recognizes this species as it runs up and  down and around the branches and trunks of trees in search of insect  food, now and then uttering its curious _Quauk, quauk, quauk_. The  White-breasted Nuthatch is often improperly called \"Sapsucker,\" a name  commonly applied to the Downy Woodpecker and others. It is a common  breeding bird and usually begins nesting early in April, and two broods  are frequently reared in a season. For its nesting place it usually  selects the decayed trunk of a tree or stub, ranging all the way from  two to sixty feet above the ground. The entrance may be a knot hole, a  small opening, or a small round hole with a larger cavity at the end of  it. Often the old excavation of the Downy Woodpecker is made use of.  Chicken feathers, hair, and a few dry leaves loosely thrown together  compose the nest.    This Nuthatch is abundant throughout the State of Illinois, and is a  permanent resident everywhere except perhaps of the extreme northern  counties. It seems to migrate in spring and return in autumn, but, in  reality, as is well known, only retreats to the woodlands to breed,  emerging again when the food supply grows scant in the autumn.    The Nuthatches associate familiarly with the Kinglets and Titmice, and  often travel with them. Though regarded as shy birds they are not really  so. Their habits of restlessness render them difficult of examination.  \"Tree-mice\" is the local name given them by the farmers, and would be  very appropriate could they sometimes remain as motionless as that  diminutive animal.    Careful observation has disclosed that the Nuthatches do not suck  the sap from trees, but that they knock off bits of decayed or loose  bark with the beak to obtain the grubs or larvae beneath. They are  beneficial to vegetation. Ignorance is responsible for the misapplied  names given to many of our well disposed and useful birds, and it would  be well if teachers were to discourage the use of inappropriate names  and familiarize the children with those recognized by the best  authorities.    Referring to the Nuthatches Mr. Baskett says: \"They are little bluish  gray birds, with white undervests--sometimes a little soiled. Their  tails are ridiculously short, and never touch the tree; neither does the  body, unless they are suddenly affrighted, when they crouch and look,  with their beaks extended, much like a knot with a broken twig on it. I  have sometimes put the bird into this attitude by clapping my hands  loudly near the window. It is an impulse that seems to come to the bird  before flight, especially if the head should be downward. His arrival  is sudden, and seems often to be distinguished by turning a somersault  before alighting, head downward, on the tree trunk, as if he had changed  his mind so suddenly about alighting that it unbalanced him.    \"I once saw two Nuthatches at what I then supposed was a new habit.  One spring day some gnats were engaged in their little crazy love  waltzes in the air, forming small whirling clouds, and the birds left  off bark-probing and began capturing insects on the wing. They were  awkward about it with their short wings, and had to alight frequently  to rest. I went out to them, and so absorbed were they that they allowed  me to approach within a yard of a limb that they came to rest upon, where  they would sit and pant till they caught their breath, when they went at  it again. They seemed fairly to revel in a new diet and a new exercise.\"          SUMMARY      Page 83.    #YELLOW WARBLER.#--_Dendroica aestiva._ Other names:  \"Summer Yellow-bird,\" \"Wild Canary,\" \"Yellow-poll Warbler.\"    RANGE--The whole of North America; breeding throughout its range.
