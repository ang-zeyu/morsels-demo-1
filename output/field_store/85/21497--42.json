Cut a slight notch in the top log of the door for the end of the  spindle and the next move is to raise the door to the proper height.  Set a stud under the door to keep it from falling. Get your spindle  ready, flatten the top of either end a little, then cut a stanchion  just the right length to set under the spindle on the first top log.    Tie your bait onto the lower end of the trigger, one man going inside  to put the trigger in the proper place. To facilitate the springing  of the trap, lay a small round stick in the upper notch of the  trigger, letting the end of the spindle come up under the stick and  as the bear gets hold of the meat on the bottom of the trigger the  least pull will roll the trigger from the end of the spindle.  However, it will spring very easily as the stanchion under the end of  the spindle is so near the end.    This kind of trap can be made by two men in one day or less, and it  often happens that the hunter and trapper wants to set a trap for  bear a long way from any settlement or road. The carrying of a fifty  pound bear trap a distance of twenty or thirty miles is no little  task. Then again, this trap costs nothing but a little time and the  trapper's whole life is given over to time. One man can make this  trap alone and set it, but it is better for two to work together in  this work, for in case the door should spring upon him while he was  inside he would be forever lost. I have caught two wildcats at once  in this pen, but it is not to be expected that you will get more than  one bear or other large animal at a time.        CHAPTER VII.    PORTABLE TRAPS.    In describing a portable deadfall, an Indiana trapper writes as  follows: We took a piece of sawed stuff 2 x 4, say 5 feet long, then  another the same size and length. For upright pieces to hold the main  pieces so one would fall square on the other, we used sawed stuff 1 x  3, two pieces set straight up and down at each end, or about far  enough to leave the back end stick out three inches, and front end or  end where the triggers set, 6 inches.    Nail these 1 x 3 two on each end as directed above, nail to lower  piece 2 x 4 only, then at back end bore a hole through the two  uprights and also upper 2 x 4, or the piece that falls, put a bolt  through, or a wood pin if the hole in the 2 x 4 is larger than those  through the uprights; then you are ready to raise it up and let it  \"drop\" to see whether it works smoothly or not.    Better nail a block 2 x 4 between the tops of the uprights to keep  them from spreading apart, then it is ready all except the triggers  and string for them to run against. It is portable, you can pick it  up and move it anywhere, only a stake or two needed driven down on  each side. Where string is shown as tied to little bush should be a  small stake.      [Illustration: DEN SET DEADFALL.]      * * *    \"SHEAR TRAP.\"    I send a drawing of a trap called the \"Shear Trap,\" writes an Eastern  trapper. This is not a new trap, neither is it my own invention. I  have used this style and can recommend it to be O. K., cheap, easy  made, light to move, will last and will catch most any small animal.    This trap is made as follows: Take 4 strips of board 4 feet 4 inches  long, by 3 inches wide. Bore one inch hole two inches from end of all  four of them. Now make two rounds about 13 inches long and put two of  the boards on each side of the round. At the other end put the two  middle boards on the other round (see illustration). Make one other  round fifteen inches long, same size as the others. Put the two  outside boards on it, forming two separate frames at the other  end--so the two inside boards can turn on the round to which they are  coupled.      [Illustration: PORTABLE WOODEN TRAP.]    Take two strips three inches wide, two feet and six inches long. Bore  one inch hole two inches from the top end and put round broom stick  thru it seventeen inches long. Fasten all the rounds by wedges or  small wooden pins. Stand the two strips last mentioned on the outside  of the frame at the end they separate and make them fast so as to  stand perpendicular. For bait stick take lathe or one-half inch board  one inch wide. Bore hole as shown in cut (figure 6) cut notch (figure  2). For trigger any stick 18 inches long, 5/8 inch thick will do: tie  string 2 inches from end and tie other end at figure 1, pass the  short end under round from the outside (figure 3) and catch in notch  in bait lath (figure 2), the other end bait at figure 4. Put weight  at figure 5. Cover trap at figure 6 to keep animal from going in from  back up to figure 7. For bait I use fresh fish, muskrat, bird, etc.,  and scent with honey or blood.      * * *    THE BARREL TRAP.    I promised in my last letter to describe the barrel trap, says a  Northwestern trapper, which I use for capturing rats. Other trappers  may have used this trap for years, but I only mean this for the young  trappers who know nothing about this trap.    Take any kind of an old barrel made of hard wood (a salt barrel makes  a good one), and fix a board on one side of the top with a hinge. Let  one end of the barrel project out directly over the barrel to within  about 5 or 6 inches of the other side. Arrange it so that the end of  the board not over the barrel is a little the heaviest so when the  rat tilts down the end in the barrel it will come back to place  again.    Place a bit of parsnip apple, or celery near the end of the board  over the barrel so when the rat reaches his front feet over on the  board it will tilt down and let him in the barrel to stay. Bury the  barrel near a river or creek to within about 2 or 3 inches of top of  barrel, so there will be from 6 inches to 1 foot of water in the  barrel. If there is much water in the barrel the most of the rats  will be dead when you visit your traps. Several may be captured in  one night in this kind of a trap.      * * *    BLOCK TRAP.    Saw a small log in blocks from 4 to 6 inches long. Bore an inch hole  through the center. Take nails and drive them so that they form a  \"muzzle\" in one end and have the nails very sharp. Fasten your blocks  with a piece of wire and put it in the runway or on a log or anywhere  that a coon will see it, and nine out of ten will put his foot into  it. I bait with honey. I caught 75 or 80 coons this season with  \"block\" snares.    I put stoppers or false bottoms in one end of the block, piece of  corn cob or anything will do. Cut the foot off to get the animal out  of this snare.      [Illustration: THE BLOCK TRAP.]    The illustration shows a square block with the hole bored in the  side. This is done to better show how it should be done, although  when set, the hole should be up. Bait with a piece of fresh rabbit,  frog, or anything that coon are fond of.    Instead of the blocks the auger hole can be bored in a log or root of  a tree if a suitable one can be found where coon frequent.      * * *    THE \"NOXEMALL\" DEADFALL.    The best material is spruce, but if spruce is not to be had, hard  wood is better than soft. Follow directions closely; never use old,  dozy wood; good, sound, straight-grained material is the cheapest to  use. A good way to get your material is to go to the saw-mill, select  good straight-grained 2 x 4 studding, have them ripped lengthwise  again, making four strips out of the original 2 x 4, each strip being  two inches wide by one inch thick; then have them cut in the  lengths--two standards (A), 14 inches long; (B) two side pieces, 2  1/2 feet long; (C) two drop bars, 2 1/2 feet. Bore a hole in each  piece with a one inch bit, two inches from the end of the piece to  the center of the hole. (D) A piece of lath about 8 inches long, with  one end beveled off to fit in slot of E; tie a piece of small rope,  about a foot long, two inches from the other end. (E) A piece of  lath, 2 1/2 feet long, with a slot cut crosswise two inches from one  end and a piece of rope tied two inch from the other end, about a  foot long.      [Illustration: THE NOX-EM-ALL DEADFALL.]    If you get your material at the mill have four rounds (F) turned out  of oak or maple (must be hard wood), three of them being 12 inches  long, one being 8 inches long, 7/8 inch in diameter. They must be  some smaller than the hole, as they swell when wet.    Your trap is now ready to put together. Take one 12 inch round slip  on the side pieces B first, then the two standards A; next place a 12  inch round in the holes in the top of the standards. The front end of  the trap is done, except fastening the standards to the round and the  setting apparatus to the top round of standards. Next take the  remaining 12 inch round slip on the drop bars C first, then the side  pieces B outside; next place the short round G in the front end of  drop bar C.    You can drive nails thru the outside pieces and the round. Where  there are two pieces on a side on one round, fasten thru the outside  piece, always leaving the inside piece loose so that it will turn on  the round. A much better way, altho it is more work, is to bore a  hole thru the side piece and round and drive in a hard wood plug.  This is the best way, because if any part of the trap breaks you can  knock out the plug much easier than to pull out a nail. The holes  should be bored with a 1/4 inch bit.    Tie the rope attached to E to the rear round, leaving two inches  play, between E and the round. Tie the rope attached to D to the top  round of standards, leaving two inches play at top and two inches  between lower end of D and bottom round.    First place a stone on the drop bar, weighing 20 pounds. Then raise  the drop bar high enough so that you can place the short lath under  the round of drop so that the weight rests on the rope. These is the  secret of setting. The pressure on top forces"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#6)"],[1,"a period of quiescence that may extend  throughout the whole of the colder months, becomes a perfect butterfly  or moth within twenty minutes of the moment of its emergence.    But this suddenness is more apparent than real, as may easily be proved  by internal examinations of the insect at various stages of growth;  showing that we are led astray by the rapidity of _external_  changes--the mere _moultings_ or castings of the skin--while the gradual  transformations proceeding within are not so readily observed.    We have already said that the life of the perfect butterfly or moth is  short. A few days after emergence from the chrysalis case, the female  deposits her eggs on the leaves or stems of the plant that is to sustain  the larvae. Her work is now accomplished, and the few days more allowed  her are spent in frolicking among the flowers, and sucking the sweet  juices they provide. But males and females alike--bedecked with the most  gorgeous colours and overflowing with sportive mirth when first they  take to the wing--soon show the symptoms of a fast approaching end.  Their colours begin to fade, and the beauty-making scales of the wings  gradually disappear through friction against the petals of hundreds of  flowers visited and the merry dances with scores and scores of playful  companions. At last, one bright afternoon, while the sun is still high  in the heavens, a butterfly, more weary than usual, with heavy and  laborious flight, seeks a place of rest for the approaching night. Here,  on a waving stalk, it is soon lulled to sleep by a gentle breeze.    Next morning, a few hours before noon, the blazing sun calls it out for  its usual frolics. But its body now seems too heavy to be supported by  the feeble and ragged wings, and, after one or two weak attempts at  play, incited by the approach of a younger and merrier companion, it  settles down in its final resting place. On the following morning a dead  butterfly is seen, still clinging by its claws to a swinging stem, from  which it is eventually thrown during a storm.    The tale of the perfect moth is very similar to the above, except that  it is generally summoned to activity by the approach of darkness.    We see, then, that butterflies and moths exhibit none of that quality  which we term parental affection. Their duty ends with the deposition of  the eggs, and the parents are dead before the young larvae have  penetrated the shell that surrounds them.    Yet it is wonderful to see how unmistakably the females generally lay  their eggs on the very plants that provide the necessary food for their  progeny, as if they were not only conscious of and careful concerning  the exact requirements of their offspring, but also possessed such a  knowledge of botanical science as enabled them to discriminate between  the plant required and all others.    Has the perfect insect any selfish motive in this apparently careful  selection of a plant on which to lay its eggs? Does the female herself  derive any benefit from the particular plant chosen for this purpose? In  most cases, certainly not. For it often happens that the blossom of this  plant is not by any means one of those that supply the sweets which  insects love, and still more frequently does it occur that the eggs are  deposited either before the flowers have appeared or after they have  faded.    Neither can we easily impute to the insect an acquired knowledge of the  nature and wants of her offspring, or an acquaintance with botany  sufficient to enable her to distinguish plant forms. Our only solution  of the problem (which is really no solution at all) is to attribute the  whole thing to that inexplicable quality which we are pleased to term  _natural instinct_. It is to be observed, however, that it is not _all_  butterflies and moths that display this unerring power. Some few seem to  deposit their eggs indiscriminately on all kinds of herbage. But, I  believe, the larvae of these species are generally grass feeders, and  would seldom have to travel far from any spot without meeting with an  acceptable morsel.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--THE FOUR STAGES OF THE LARGE WHITE BUTTERFLY  (_Pieris Brassicae_). _a_, larva; _b_, pupa; _c_, imago; _d_, egg.]    But we must now pass on to a brief consideration of the other stages of  the insect's existence. After a time, varying from a few days to several  months, the young caterpillars or larvae make their appearance. They soon  commence feeding in right earnest. Their period of existence in this  state varies from a few weeks to several months, and even, in some  cases, to years. During this time their growth is generally very rapid,  and they undergo a series of _moults_ or changes of skin, of which we  shall have more to say in a future chapter. Then, when fully grown, they  prepare for an apparently quiescent form, which we speak of as the  _pupa_ or chrysalis, and in which they again spend a very variable  period, extending over a few days, weeks, or months. Now, inclosed in a  protective case, each pupa is undergoing a remarkable change. Some of  its old organs are disappearing, and others are developing; and, after  all the parts of the future insect have been developed as far as its  narrow shell will permit, it bursts forth into the world as a perfect  insect or _imago_.    Its wings at first are small, shapeless, and crumpled in a most  unsightly fashion; but it is not long before they assume their full  size, beautiful form, and gorgeous colouring. Then, in about another  hour or two, the wings, at first soft and flaccid, have become  sufficiently dry and stiff to bear their owner rapidly through the air.    We have thus observed some of the more striking features in the  structure of the butterfly and moth in its most perfect state; and  alluded in a very brief manner to the various stages through which these  creatures must necessarily pass before finally reaching this stage. But  now we must study these earlier stages more closely, and watch the  insects during the marvellous transitions they are destined to undergo.  This we shall do in the following chapters.          CHAPTER II    _THE EGG_      I suppose you are all acquainted with the general structure of the hen's  egg, having dissected several, in your own way, many a time.    Its outer covering, which you speak of as the 'shell,' you have observed  is hard and brittle. It is composed of a _calcareous_ or limy substance,  known chemically as _carbonate of lime_. If you put some pieces of it  into an egg cup, and throw over them a little vinegar or any other  liquid acid, you will see them gradually dissolve away, and small  bubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise into the air. Then again, if you  take a long and narrow strip of the shell, and hold one end of it in a  gas or lamp flame, after a short time that end will become softer, and  will glow brightly in the flame, for it is converted into lime--the same  substance that is used by the builders for making their mortar--and the  bright glow is really a miniature _lime light_, such as is always  produced when a piece of lime is made intensely hot.    Just inside this shell you have seen a thin membrane or skin that is  easily peeled off the substance of the egg itself. Next to this comes  the 'white' of the egg, which is really colourless while liquid, but  turns white and more or less solid in the cooking. Last of all, in the  centre of this, you have noticed the oval yellow mass that is termed the  'yoke' or 'yolk,' and which contains the embryo of the future chick.    Now if you imagine this egg to be reduced in size till two or three  dozen of them would be required to form a single line about one inch  long, the outer calcareous shell to be entirely removed, the skin or  membrane to be converted into a firmer substance of a horny nature, and,  finally, the yolk to be absent and the whole internal space to be filled  with the 'white,' you will then have some idea of the nature of the egg  of a butterfly or moth.    To put the matter more briefly, then, we will say that the eggs of these  insects are simply little liquid masses, usually of a colourless  substance, surrounded by a horny and flexible covering.    Such a description may certainly give you some idea of the nature of the  eggs of insects, but no amount of book reading will serve the purpose so  well or be so pleasant as the examination of the eggs themselves. During  the summer months very little difficulty will be experienced in finding  some eggs in your own garden. Turn over some leaves and examine their  under surfaces, choosing especially those plants which show, by their  partially eaten leaves, that they are favourites with the insect world.  Or you may amuse yourself by catching a number of butterflies--common  'Whites' are as good for the purpose as any--and temporarily confine  them in a wooden or cardboard box, containing a number of leaves from  various plants, and covered with gauze. In this way you are sure to  obtain a few females that have not yet laid all their eggs; and if you  watch your prisoners you will soon see them carefully depositing the  eggs on the under surfaces of leaves, bending their abdomens round the  edges if there is not sufficient room to get themselves completely  under. And then, when you are satisfied with the number of eggs thus  obtained for your examination, you can have the pleasure of seeing all  your liberated captives flying joyfully in the free air.    In giving these simple instructions I have assumed that the reader has  not yet learnt any of the characters by which female butterflies are to  be distinguished from their lords and masters; but I hope that he will  know soon, at least with regard to a good many species, from which  individuals he may most reasonably expect to obtain eggs, and so be able  to avoid the imprisonment, even though only temporary, of insects which  cannot satisfy his wants."]]]
