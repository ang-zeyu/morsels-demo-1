'Where are my colonies? Where are my Batavian  provinces? Where is my gigantic power, and the glory of Spain, which  resounded from one hemisphere to the other? What have you done with my  inheritance, ye cowardly and unskillful men? Where are my treasures; where  the victorious fleets that crossed the ocean to bring back in profusion to  my empire the gold and gems of the New World?' The question naturally  arises, what can be the cause of so many evils? of such utter misery, such  extreme ignorance, such disgusting sloth?    \"_Tyranny_, says the politician.    \"_Catholicism_, says the Protestant.    \"_The Inquisition_, adds the historian.    \"But these three replies form but one; they are the three sides of a  prism, which, united, give the entire ray of truth. In truth, Catholicism  is the father, the Inquisition and tyranny the daughters. We are not the  first to pen these words; we only repeat what we have read in the lines we  are now going to submit to the perusal of our readers. It is sufficient  for us to have pointed out the connection of the different causes which  will be assigned by our authorities.    \"That Catholicism produced the Inquisition, a tribunal of priests, judging  heretics, it is unnecessary to demonstrate, for the very nature of the  institution renders it evident. The ruling idea of Catholicism, the  principle of authority, was the germ of the Inquisition. It was impossible  that the Romish Church should not extend its principle to its penal code;  it does not doubt in matters of faith, neither does it doubt in criminal  matters. This is the reason why, in the church, the accused and the guilty  have but one and the same appellation. Whoever is arraigned at her  tribunal has heaven and earth against him; the interrogatory is already a  species of torture. When the church accuses, she seems already convinced;  all her efforts tend to extort the confession of the crime, which, in  virtue of her infallibility, she discovers in darkness; from this  anticipated conviction of the guilt of the accused are produced all those  ambushes and snares laid for the purpose of obtaining, by surprise, the  confession of the accused. The names of the witnesses are concealed or  falsified. Everywhere, in the most trifling details, it is strikingly  evident that, truth is on one side, and the demon on the other.\" [See  Tardiff, pp. 139, 140.]    In the second place, that Catholicism has produced the Spanish absolutism  of the Catholic kings is sufficiently shown by the very name given to  these kings.    \"Another no less deplorable consequence of the position of the clergy in  Spain and Portugal is, that they have no sooner confounded the cause of  religion with that of despotism, than this error, producing its  consequences, leads to a monstrous abuse of the word of God. Political  fury has invaded the pulpit and stained it with abject and sacrilegious  adulation.... The lips, whose mission is to speak peace, charity and  mutual love, have spoken the language of hatred and vengeance; horrible  vows, abominable threats in the presence of the tabernacles in which  abides the Son of Man, who sacrificed his life for the salvation of his  brethren.\" [Affairs de Rome, pp. 250 to 254.]    \"Spain, since Phillip II., has remained closed and uninfluenced by the  ordinary progress of the human mind elsewhere. The monkish and despotic  spirit has long preserved itself in the midst of ignorance, without,  indeed, acquiring strength from abroad, but at the same time without  permitting the intelligence of the nation to borrow foreign arms against  it.\" [Idem, p. 53.]    We shall now see this Spanish Catholicism at work; for three centuries,  assisted by its worthy offspring, absolutism and the Inquisition, and at  every ruin, at every crime you meet with, if you ask who has done this,  the reply will assuredly be: the church of the Pope, the tyranny of the  Catholic kings, the Inquisition of the priests. To convince yourselves of  the fact, you need only put your questions and listen to the records of  history, written not by us, but by men of talent and skill, who have long  enjoyed unquestionable authority.    The expulsion of the Jews and the Moors was the first fruit of the  Catholic Inquisition. \"Spain,\" says M. Roseew Saint Hilaire, \"exterminated  them forever as poisonous plants from its soil, mortal to heresy. The Jews  and the Moors left it in turn, carrying with them, the former trade, the  latter agriculture, from this disinherited land, to which the New World,  to repair so many losses, vainly bequeathed her sterile treasures. And let  it not be said that Spain, in thus depriving herself of her most active  citizens, was not aware of the extent of her loss. All her historians  concur in the statement that in acting thus she sacrificed her temporal  interests to her religious convictions, and all are at a loss for words to  extol such a glorious sacrifice.    \"In banishing the Jews from her territory, Spain, then acted consistently;  her conduct was logically just, but according to that pitiless logic which  ruins States in order to save a principle. From that period, therefore, a  new era begins for Castile. Until then she had been divided from the rest  of Europe only by her position; foreign, without being hostile, to the  ideas of the continent, she had not begun to wage war with those ideas;  but the establishment of the Inquisition is the first step in the career  in which she can never stop.\" [Saint Hilaire, vol. 6, p. 52.]    \"It required,\" says M. Sismondi, \"about one generation to accustom the  Spaniards to the sanguinary proceedings of the Inquisition, and to  fanaticise the people. This work, dictated by an infernal policy, was  scarcely accomplished, when Charles the Fifth began his reign. It was  probably the fatal spectacle of the auto-dae-fe that imparted to the  Spanish soldiers their ferocity, so remarkable during the whole of that  period, which before that time was so foreign to the national character.\"  [Sismondi, vol. 3, p. 265.] Who, employing these instruments, depopulated  Spain? THE INQUISITION. \"To calculate,\" says Liorente, secretary to the  Holy office, \"the number of victims of the Inquisition were to give  palpable proof of the most powerful and active causes of the depopulation  of Spain; for, if to several millions of inhabitants of which the  Inquisitorial system has deprived this kingdom by the total expulsion of  the Jews, the conquered Moors and the baptized Moorish, we add about  500,000 families entirely destroyed by the executions of the Holy (?)  office, it will be proved beyond a doubt that had it not been for this  tribunal, and the influence of its maxims, Spain would possess 12,000,000  souls above her present population, supposed to amount to 11,000,000.\"  [Liorente, vol. 4, p. 242.]    \"The Inquisition ruined and branded with infamy more than 340,000 persons,  whose disgrace was reflected on their families, and who bequeathed only  opprobrium and misery to their children. Add to these more than 100,000  families who emigrated in order to escape from the blood-thirsty tribunal,  and it will be seen that the Inquisition has been the most active  instrument of the ruin of Spain. But the most disastrous of all the acts  which it occasioned was the expulsion of the Moors. If we add to those who  were banished from Spain the countless numbers who perished in the  insurrection of the sixteenth century, and the 800,000 Jews who left the  kingdom, it will be seen that the country lost in the course of a hundred  and twenty years about three millions of its most industrious  inhabitants.\" [Weiss, vol. 2, pp. 60, 61.]    \"The advisors of Phillip III. said to him with affright: The houses are  falling in ruins, and none rebuild them; the inhabitants flee from the  country; villages are abandoned, fields left uncultivated, and churches  deserted. The Cortes in their turn said to him: if the evil is not  remedied, there will soon be no peasants left to till the ground, no  pilots to steer the ships; none will marry. The kingdom can not subsist  another century if a wholesome remedy be not found.\"    What was the cause of the ignorance so general and so profound in Spain?  The Catholic Inquisition. \"The commissaries of the Holy office received  orders to oppose the introduction of books written by the partisans of  modern philosophy, as reprobated by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and  ordered information to be given against persons known to be attached to  the principles of the insurrection.\" [Liorente, vol. 4, p. 99.]  \"Theological censures attacked even works on politics, and on natural,  civil and international law. The consequence is, that those appointed to  examine publications condemn and proscribe all works necessary for the  diffusion of knowledge among the Spaniards. The books that have been  published on mathematics, astronomy, natural philosophy and several other  branches of science connected with those, are not treated with more  favor.\" [Liorente, vol. 4, p. 420.] \"The Inquisition is, perhaps, the most  active cause of that intellectual death that visited Spain at the close of  the seventeenth century.... It encouraged ignorance, and instituted a  censorship even for works on jurisprudence, philosophy, and politics, and  for novels that reflected on the avarice and rapacity of the priests,  their dissolute conduct, and their hypocricy.\" [Weiss, vol. 2, pp. 319 to  321.] \"Lastly, if it be asked what has corrupted the morals both of the  clergy and the laity of the former times and of the present day, the  answer is still, Catholic superstition!\" [Napoleon Roussell.] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#6)"],[1,".[3]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Slow movement of the north pole in a circle  among the stars. (Copied from Sir R. Ball.)]    This perception of the conical motion of the earth's axis was a  beautiful generalization of Copernik's, whereby a multitude of facts  were grouped into a single phenomenon. Of course he did not explain the  motion of the axis itself. He stated the fact that it so moved, and I do  not suppose it ever struck him to seek for an explanation.    An explanation was given later, and that a most complete one; but the  idea even of seeking for it is a brilliant and striking one: the  achievement of the explanation by a single individual in the way it  actually was accomplished is one of the most astounding things in the  history of science; and were it not that the same individual  accomplished a dozen other things, equally and some still more  extraordinary, we should rank that man as one of the greatest  astronomers that ever lived.    As it is, he is Sir Isaac Newton.    We are to remember, then, as the life-work of Copernicus, that he placed  the sun in its true place as the centre of the solar system, instead of  the earth; that he greatly simplified the theory of planetary motion by  this step, and also by the simpler epicyclic chain which now sufficed,  and which he worked out mathematically; that he exhibited the precession  of the equinoxes (discovered by Hipparchus) as due to a conical motion  of the earth's axis; and that, by means of his simpler theory and more  exact planetary tables, he reduced to some sort of order the confused  chaos of the Ptolemaic system, whose accumulation of complexity and of  outstanding errors threatened to render astronomy impossible by the mere  burden of its detail.    There are many imperfections in his system, it is true; but his great  merit is that he dared to look at the facts of Nature with his own eyes,  unhampered by the prejudice of centuries. A system venerable with age,  and supported by great names, was universally believed, and had been  believed for centuries. To doubt this system, and to seek after another  and better one, at a time when all men's minds were governed by  tradition and authority, and when to doubt was sin--this required a  great mind and a high character. Such a mind and such a character had  this monk of Frauenburg. And it is interesting to notice that the  so-called religious scruples of smaller and less truly religious men did  not affect Copernicus; it was no dread of consequences to one form of  truth that led him to delay the publication of the other form of truth  specially revealed to him. In his dedication he says:--    \"If there be some babblers who, though ignorant of all mathematics, take  upon them to judge of these things, and dare to blame and cavil at my  work, because of some passage of Scripture which they have wrested to  their own purpose, I regard them not, and will not scruple to hold their  judgment in contempt.\"    I will conclude with the words of one of his biographers (Mr. E.J.C.  Morton):--    \"Copernicus cannot be said to have flooded with light the dark places of  nature--in the way that one stupendous mind subsequently did--but still,  as we look back through the long vista of the history of science, the  dim Titanic figure of the old monk seems to rear itself out of the dull  flats around it, pierces with its head the mists that overshadow them,  and catches the first gleam of the rising sun,      \"'... like some iron peak, by the Creator      Fired with the red glow of the rushing morn.'\"          DATES AND SUMMARY OF FACTS FOR LECTURE II      Copernicus lived from 1473 to 1543, and was contemporary with Paracelsus  and Raphael.      Tycho Brahe     from 1546 to 1601.    Kepler          from 1571 to 1630.    Galileo         from 1564 to 1642.    Gilbert         from 1540 to 1603.    Francis Bacon   from 1561 to 1626.    Descartes       from 1596 to 1650.    _A sketch of Tycho Brahe's life and work._ Tycho was a Danish noble,  born on his ancestral estate at Knudstorp, near Helsinborg, in 1546.  Adopted by his uncle, and sent to the University of Copenhagen to study  law. Attracted to astronomy by the occurrence of an eclipse on its  predicted day, August 21st, 1560. Began to construct astronomical  instruments, especially a quadrant and a sextant. Observed at Augsburg  and Wittenberg. Studied alchemy, but was recalled to astronomy by the  appearance of a new star. Overcame his aristocratic prejudices, and  delivered a course of lectures at Copenhagen, at the request of the  king. After this he married a peasant girl. Again travelled and observed  in Germany. In 1576 was sent for to Denmark by Frederick II., and  established in the island of Huen, with an endowment enabling him to  devote his life to astronomy. Built Uraniburg, furnished it with  splendid instruments, and became the founder of accurate instrumental  astronomy. His theories were poor, but his observations were admirable.  In 1592 Frederick died, and five years later, Tycho was impoverished and  practically banished. After wandering till 1599, he was invited to  Prague by the Emperor Rudolf, and there received John Kepler among other  pupils. But the sentence of exile was too severe, and he died in 1601,  aged 54 years.    A man of strong character, untiring energy, and devotion to accuracy,  his influence on astronomy has been immense.          LECTURE II    TYCHO BRAHE AND THE EARLIEST OBSERVATORY      We have seen how Copernicus placed the earth in its true position in the  solar system, making it merely one of a number of other worlds revolving  about a central luminary. And observe that there are two phenomena to be  thus accounted for and explained: first, the diurnal revolution of the  heavens; second, the annual motion of the sun among the stars.    The effect of the diurnal motion is conspicuous to every one, and  explains the rising, southing, and setting of the whole visible  firmament. The effect of the annual motion, _i.e._ of the apparent  annual motion, of the sun among the stars, is less obvious, but it may  be followed easily enough by observing the stars visible at any given  time of evening at different seasons of the year. At midnight, for  instance, the position of the sun is definite, viz. due north always,  but the constellation which at that time is due south or is rising or  setting varies with the time of year; an interval of one month producing  just the same effect on the appearance of the constellations as an  interval of two hours does (because the day contains twice as many hours  as the year contains months), _e.g._ the sky looks the same at midnight  on the 1st of October as it does at 10 p.m. on the 1st of November.    All these simple consequences of the geocentric as opposed to the  heliocentric point of view were pointed out by Copernicus, in addition  to his greater work of constructing improved planetary tables on the  basis of his theory. But it must be admitted that he himself felt the  hypothesis of the motion of the earth to be a difficulty. Its acceptance  is by no means such an easy and childish matter as we are apt now to  regard it, and the hostility to it is not at all surprising. The human  race, after having ridiculed and resisted the truth for a long time, is  apt to end in accepting it so blindly and unimaginatively as to fail to  recognize the real achievement of its first propounders, or the  difficulties which they had to overcome. The majority of men at the  present day have grown accustomed to hear the motion of the earth spoken  of: their acceptance of it means nothing: the attitude of the paradoxer  who denies it is more intelligent.    It is not to be supposed that the idea of thus explaining some of the  phenomena of the heavens, especially the daily motion of the entire  firmament, by a diurnal rotation of the earth had not struck any one. It  was often at this time referred to as the Pythagorean theory, and it had  been taught, I believe, by Aristarchus. But it was new to the modern  world, and it had the great weight of Aristotle against it.  Consequently, for long after Copernicus, only a few leading spirits  could be found to support it, and the long-established venerable  Ptolemaic system continued to be taught in all Universities.    The main objections to the motion of the earth were such as the  following:--    1. The motion is unfelt and difficult to imagine.         That it is unfelt is due to its uniformity, and can be explained       mechanically. That it is difficult to imagine is and remains true,       but a most important lesson we have to learn is that difficulty of       conception is no valid argument against reality.    2. That the stars do not alter their relative positions according to  the season of the year, but the constellations preserve always the same  aspect precisely, even to careful measurement.         This is indeed a difficulty, and a great one. In June the earth is       184 million miles away from where it was in December: how can we       see precisely the same fixed stars? It is not possible, unless they       are at a practically infinite distance. That is the only answer       that can be given. It was the tentative answer given by Copernicus.       It is the correct answer. Not only from every position of the       earth, but from every planet of the solar system, the same       constellations are visible, and the stars have the same aspect. The       whole immensity of the solar system shrinks to practically a point       when confronted with the distance of the stars.         Not, however, so entirely a speck as to resist the terrific       accuracy of the present century, and their microscopic relative       displacement with the season of the year has now at length been       detected, and the distance of many thereby measured.    3.
