I thought at first that it was you, but there  were at least twenty running around; I also heard conversation and  cries. At length came heavy steps upon the stairs. After this I was no  longer conscious; but at times my recollection returned for a moment,  and then I saw the same man who is nailed to the mast, sit down at  that table, singing and drinking; and he who lies not far from him on  the floor, in a scarlet cloak, sat near him, and helped him to drink.\"  Thus spoke my old servant to me.    You may believe me, my friends, that all was not right to my mind;  for there was no delusion--I too had plainly heard the dead. To sail  in such company was to me horrible; my Ibrahim, however, was again  absorbed in deep reflection. \"I have it now!\" he exclaimed at length;  there occurred to him, namely, a little verse, which his grandfather,  a man of experience and travel, had taught him, and which could give  assistance against every ghost and spectre. He also maintained that we  could, the next night, prevent the unnatural sleep which had come upon  us, by repeating right fervently sentences out of the Koran.    The proposition of the old man pleased me well. In anxious expectation  we saw the night set in. Near the cabin was a little room, to which we  determined to retire. We bored several holes in the door, large enough  to give us a view of the whole cabin; then we shut it as firmly as we  could from within, and Ibrahim wrote the name of the Prophet in all  four corners of the room. Thus we awaited the terrors of the night.    It might again have been about the eleventh hour, when a strong  inclination for sleep began to overpower me. My companion, thereupon,  advised me to repeat some sentences from the Koran, which assisted me  to retain my consciousness. All at once it seemed to become lively  overhead; the ropes creaked, there were steps upon the deck, and  several voices were plainly distinguishable. We remained, a few  moments, in intense anxiety; then we heard something descending the  cabin stairs. When the old man became aware of this, he began to  repeat the words which his grandfather had taught him to use against  spirits and witchcraft:        \"Come you, from the air descending,        Rise you from the deep sea-cave,      Spring you forth where flames are blending,        Glide you in the dismal grave:      Allah reigns, let all adore him!      Own him, spirits--bow before him!\"    I must confess I did not put much faith in this verse, and my hair  stood on end when the door flew open. The same large, stately man  entered, whom I had seen nailed to the mast. The spike still passed  through the middle of his brain, but he had sheathed his sword. Behind  him entered another, attired with less magnificence, whom also I had  seen lying on the deck. The Captain, for he was unquestionably of this  rank, had a pale countenance, a large black beard, and wildly-rolling  eyes, with which he surveyed the whole apartment. I could see him  distinctly, for he moved over opposite to us; but he appeared not to  observe the door which concealed us. The two seated themselves at the  table, which stood in the centre of the cabin, and spoke loud and  fast, shouting together in an unknown tongue. They continually became  more noisy and earnest, until at length, with doubled fist, the  Captain brought the table a blow which shook the whole apartment. With  wild laughter the other sprang up, and beckoned to the Captain to  follow him. The latter rose, drew his sabre, and then both left the  apartment. We breathed more freely when they were away; but our  anxiety had still for a long time no end. Louder and louder became the  noise upon deck; we heard hasty running to and fro, shouting,  laughing, and howling. At length there came an actually hellish sound,  so that we thought the deck and all the sails would fall down upon us,  the clash of arms, and shrieks--of a sudden all was deep silence.  When, after many hours, we ventured to go forth, we found every thing  as before; not one lay differently--all were as stiff as wooden  figures.    [Illustration]    Thus passed we several days on the vessel; it moved continually  towards the East, in which direction, according to my calculation, lay  the land; but if by day it made many miles, by night it appeared to go  back again, for we always found ourselves in the same spot when the  sun went down. We could explain this in no other way, than that the  dead men every night sailed back again with a full breeze. In order to  prevent this, we took in all the sail before it became night, and  employed the same means as at the door in the cabin; we wrote on  parchment the name of the Prophet, and also, in addition, the little  stanza of the grandfather, and bound them upon the furled sail.  Anxiously we awaited the result in our chamber. The ghosts appeared  this time not to rage so wickedly; and, mark, the next morning the  sails were still rolled up as we had left them. During the day we  extended only as much as was necessary to bear the ship gently along,  and so in five days we made considerable headway.    At last, on the morning of the sixth day, we espied land at a short  distance, and thanked Allah and his Prophet for our wonderful  deliverance. This day and the following night we sailed along the  coast, and on the seventh morning thought we discovered a city at no  great distance: with a good deal of trouble we cast an anchor into the  sea, which soon reached the bottom; then launching a boat which stood  upon the deck, we rowed with all our might towards the city. After  half an hour we ran into a river that emptied into the sea, and  stepped ashore. At the gate we inquired what the place was called, and  learned that it was an Indian city, not far from the region to which  at first I had intended to sail. We repaired to a Caravansery, and  refreshed ourselves after our adventurous sail. I there inquired for a  wise and intelligent man, at the same time giving the landlord to  understand that I would like to have one tolerably conversant with  magic. He conducted me to an unsightly house in a remote street,  knocked thereat, and one let me in with the injunction that I should  ask only for Muley.    In the house, came to me a little old man with grizzled beard and a  long nose, to demand my business. I told him I was in search of the  wise Muley; he answered me that he was the man. I then asked his  advice as to what I should do to the dead bodies, and how I must  handle them in order to remove them from the ship.    He answered me that the people of the ship were probably enchanted on  account of a crime somewhere upon the sea: he thought the spell would  be dissolved by bringing them to land, but this could be done only by  taking up the planks on which they lay. In the sight of God and  justice, he said that the ship, together with all the goods, belonged  to me, since I had, as it were, found it; and, if I would keep it very  secret, and make him a small present out of my abundance, he would  assist me with his slaves to remove the bodies. I promised to reward  him richly, and we set out on our expedition with five slaves, who  were supplied with saws and hatchets. On the way, the magician Muley  could not sufficiently praise our happy expedient of binding the  sails around with the sentences from the Koran. He said this was the  only means, by which we could have saved ourselves.    It was still pretty early in the day when we reached the ship. We  immediately set to work, and in an hour placed four in the boat. Some  of the slaves were then obliged to row to land to bury them there.  They told us, when they returned, that the bodies had spared them the  trouble of burying, since, the moment they laid them on the earth,  they had fallen to dust. We diligently set to work to saw off the  bodies, and before evening all were brought to land. There were, at  last, no more on board than the one that was nailed to the mast.  Vainly sought we to draw the nail out of the wood, no strength was  able to start it even a hair's-breadth. I knew not what next to do,  for we could not hew down the mast in order to bring him to land; but  in this dilemma Muley came to my assistance. He quickly ordered a  slave to row to land and bring a pot of earth. When he had arrived  with it, the magician pronounced over it some mysterious words, and  cast it on the dead man's head. Immediately the latter opened his  eyes, drew a deep breath, and the wound of the nail in his forehead  began to bleed. We now drew it lightly forth, and the wounded man fell  into the arms of one of the slaves.    \"Who bore me hither?\" he exclaimed, after he seemed to have recovered  himself a little. Muley made signs to me, and I stepped up to him.    \"Thank thee, unknown stranger; thou hast freed me from long torment.  For fifty years has my body been sailing through these waves, and my  spirit was condemned to return to it every night. But now my head has  come in contact with the earth, and, my crime expiated, I can go to my  fathers!\"    I entreated him, thereupon, to tell how he had been brought to this  horrible state, and he began--    \"Fifty years ago, I was an influential, distinguished man, and resided  in Algiers: a passion for gain urged me on to fit out a ship, and turn  pirate. I had already followed this business some time, when once, at  Zante, I took on board a Dervise, who wished to travel for nothing. I  and my companions were impious men, and paid no respect to the  holiness of the man; I, in particular, made sport of him. When,  however, on one occasion he upbraided me with holy zeal for my wicked  course of life, that same evening, after I had been drinking to excess  with my pilot in the cabin, anger overpowered me.

Among those who perceived with great clearness the political tendency  of these propositions, and rejoiced in it, was the elector of Saxony  himself, the most powerful prince of the empire, who had long been  vexed, in view of the vast sums which had been drained from his  subjects. He also lamented the corruptions of the church, and probably  sympathized with the theological opinions of Luther. He accordingly  protected the bold professor, although he did not openly encourage  him, or form an alliance with him. He let things take their course.  Well did Frederic deserve the epithet of _Wise_.    [Sidenote: Erasmus--Melancthon.]    There was another great man who rejoiced in the appearance of Luther's  theses; and this was Erasmus, the greatest scholar of his age, the  autocrat of letters, and, at that time, living in Basle. He was born  in Rotterdam, in 1467, of poor parents, but early attracted notice for  his attainments, and early emancipated himself from the trammels of  scholasticism, which he hated and despised as cordially as Luther  himself. He also attacked, with elegant sarcasm the absurdities of his  age, both in literature and morals. He denounced the sins and follies  of the monks, and spoke of the necessity of reform. But his  distinguishing excellence was his literary talent and taste. He was a  great Greek scholar, and published a critical edition of the  Testament, which he accompanied with a Latin translation. In this, he  rendered great service to the reformers, especially to Luther. His  fascinating style and extensive erudition gave him great literary  fame. But he was timid, conservative, and vain; and sought to be  popular, except among the monks, whom he uniformly ridiculed. One  doctor hated him so cordially, that he had his picture hung up in his  study, that he might spit in his face as often as he pleased. So far  as Luther opposed monkery and despotism, his sympathies were with him.  But he did not desire a radical reformation, as Luther did, and always  shunned danger and obloquy. He dreaded an insurrection among the  people, and any thing which looked either revolutionary or fanatical.  Luther, therefore, much as he was gratified by his favor at first,  soon learned to distrust him; and finally these two great men were  unfriendly to each other.    Melancthon was too prominent an actor in the great drama about to be  performed, to be omitted in this sketch of great men who were on the  side of reform. He was born in 1497, and was, therefore, fourteen  years younger than Luther. He was educated under the auspices of the  celebrated Greek scholar Reuchlin, who was also a relative. At twelve,  he was sent to the university of Heidelberg; at fourteen, was made  bachelor of arts; and at seventeen, doctor of philosophy. He began to  lecture publicly at the age of seventeen; and, for his extraordinary  attainments, was invited to Wittemberg, as professor of ancient  languages, at the age of twenty-one. He arrived there in 1518, and  immediately fell under the influence of Luther, who, however,  acknowledged his classical attainments. He was considered a prodigy;  was remarkably young looking, and so boyish, that the grave professors  conceived but little hope of him at first. But, when he delivered his  inaugural oration in Latin, all were astonished; and their prejudices  were removed. Luther himself was enthusiastic in his praises, and a  friendship commenced between them, which was never weakened by a  quarrel. The mildness and gentleness of Philip Melancthon strongly  contrasted with the boldness, energy, and tumultuous passions of  Luther. The former was the more learned and elegant; the latter was  the superior genius--a genius for commanding men, and guiding great  enterprises.    [Sidenote: Melancthon--Leo X.]    But there was another great personage, who now viewed the movement of  Luther with any thing but indifference; and this was Leo X., the  reigning pope when the theses were published. He belonged to the  illustrious family of the Medici, and was chosen cardinal at the age  of thirteen. He was the most elegant and accomplished of all the  popes, patronized art and literature, and ornamented his capital with  palaces, churches, and statues. But with his sympathy for intellectual  excellence, he was prodigal, luxurious, and worldly. Indeed, his  spirit was almost infidel. He was more ambitious for temporal than  spiritual power; and, when he commenced his reign, the papal  possessions were more extensive and flourishing, than at any previous  period. His leading error was, his recklessness in the imposition of  taxes, even on the clergy themselves, by which he lost their  confidence and regard. With a very fine mind, he was, nevertheless,  quite unfitted for his station and his times.    Thus far, he had allowed the outcry which Luther had raised against  indulgences to take its course, and even disregarded the theses, which  he supposed originated in a monkish squabble. But the Emperor  Maximilian was alarmed, and wrote to the pope an account of Luther's  differences with Tetzel. Frederic of Saxony had also written to his  holiness, to palliate the conduct of Luther.    When such powerful princes became interested, Leo was startled. He  summoned Luther to Rome, to be tried by Prierias. Luther, not daring  to refuse, and not willing to obey, wrote to his friend Spalatin to  use his influence with the elector to have his cause tried in Germany;  and the pope, willing to please Frederic, appointed De Vio, his  legate, to investigate the matter. Luther accordingly set out for  Augsburg, in obedience to the summons of De Vio, although dissuaded by  many of his friends. He had several interviews with the legate, by  whom he was treated with courtesy and urbanity, and by whom he was  dissuaded from his present courses. But all the persuasion and  argument of the cardinal legate were without effect on the mind of  Luther, whose convictions were not to be put aside by either kindness  or craft. De Vio had hoped that he could induce Luther to retract;  but, when he found him fixed in his resolutions, he changed his tone,  and resorted to threats. Luther then made up his mind to leave  Augsburg; and, appealing to the decision of the sovereign pontiff,  whose authority he had not yet openly defied, he fled from the city,  and returned to Wittemberg, being countenanced by the elector, to whom  he also addressed letters. His life was safe so long as Frederic  protected him.    [Sidenote: The Leipsic Disputation.]    The next event in the progress of Luther was the Leipsic disputation,  June, 1519. The pope seemed willing to make one more effort to  convince Luther, before he proceeded to more violent courses. There  was then at his court a noble Saxon, Charles Miltitz, whose talents  and insinuating address secured him the high office of chamberlain to  the pope. He accordingly was sent into his native country, with the  dignity of legate, to remove the difficulties which De Vio had  attempted. He tried persuasion and flattery, and treated the reformer  with great civility. But Luther still persisted in refusing to  retract, and the matter was referred to the elector archbishop of  Treves.    While the controversy was pending, Dr. Eck, of the university of  Ingolstadt, a man of great scholastic ingenuity and attainment, and  proud of the prizes of eight universities, challenged the professors  of Wittemberg to a public controversy on Grace and Free Will. He  regarded a disputation with the eye of a practised fencer, and sought  the means of extending his fame over North Germany. Leipsic was the  appointed arena, and thither resorted the noble and the learned of  Saxony. Eck was among the first who arrived, and, soon after, came  Carlstadt, Luther, and Melancthon.    [Sidenote: Principles of the Leipsic Disputation.]    The place for the combat was a hall in the royal palace of Duke  George, cousin to the elector Frederic, which was arranged and  ornamented with great care, and which was honored by the presence of  the duke, and of the chief divines and nobles of Northern Germany.  Carlstadt opened the debate, which did not excite much interest until  Luther's turn came, the antagonist whom Eck was most desirous to meet,  and whose rising fame he hoped to crush by a brilliant victory. Ranke  thus describes Luther's person at this time. \"He was of the middle  size, and so thin as to be mere skin and bone. He possessed neither  the thundering voice, nor the ready memory, nor the skill and  dexterity, of his distinguished antagonist. But he stood in the prime  of manhood and in the fulness of his strength. His voice was melodious  and clear; he was perfectly versed in the Bible, and its aptest  sentences presented themselves unbidden to his mind; above all, he  inspired an irresistible conviction that he sought the truth. He was  always cheerful at home, and a joyous, jocose companion at table; he  even, on this grave occasion, ascended the platform with a nosegay in  his hand; but, when there, he displayed the intrepid and  self-forgetting earnestness arising from the depth of a conviction,  until now, unfathomed, even by himself. He drew forth new thoughts,  and placed them in the fire of the battle, with a determination that  knew no fear and no personal regard. His features bore the traces of  the storms that had passed over his soul, and of the courage with  which he was prepared to encounter those which yet awaited him. His  whole aspect evinced profound thought, joyousness of temper, and  confidence in the future. The battle immediately commenced on the  question of the authority of the papacy, which, at once intelligible  and important, riveted universal attention.\" Eck, with great erudition  and masterly logic, supported the claim of the pope, from the decrees  of councils, the opinions of"]]]
