Then the stewing liquor went into the  crevices--there might also be a few very tiny crisp brown  sausages--cakes no bigger than a lady's watch. Over all came a thick,  rich crust, with a cross-cut in the middle, and corners turned deftly  back. When the crust was brown the pie was done.    No doubt we were foolish--but somehow the regular \"cases\" made our  sausages unappetizing if we put it into them for keeping. Further the  \"Tom Thumbs\" were in great request for chitterlings--I never saw them  served to white folks but have smelled their savoriness in the cabins.  That is, however, beside the mark. We saved our sausage against the  spring scarcity in several ways. One was to fry it in quantity, pack the  cakes as fried in crocks, pour over them the gravy, and when the jar was  almost full, cover the top an inch deep with melted lard. Kept cool and  dark the cakes came out as good as they went in. Still there were  palates that craved smoked sausage. To satisfy them, some folk tied up  the meat in links of clean corn husks, and hung them at the side where  the smoke barely touched them. Another way was to make small bags of  stout unbleached muslin, fill, tie close, dip the bag in melted grease,  cool and smoke. The dipping was not really essential--still it kept the  sausage a little fresher. Latterly I have been wondering if paraffin had  been known then whether or not it would have served better than grease.          [Illustration: _Hams and Other Hams_]      The proper boiling of a proper ham reaches the level of high art. Proper  boiling makes any sound ham tolerable eating; conversely a crass and  hasty cook can spoil utterly this crowning mercy of the smokehouse. Yet  proper cooking is not a recondite process, nor one beyond the simplest  intelligence. It means first and most, pains and patience, with somewhat  of foresight, and something more of judgment.    Cut off the hock, but not too high--barely the slender shankbone. Then  go all over the ham with a dull knife, scraping off every bit of  removable grease or soilure. Wipe afterward with a coarse, damp cloth,  then lay in a dishpan and cover an inch deep with cold water. If the  water is very hard soften by adding a tiny pinch of baking soda. Leave  in soak all night. In the morning wash well all over, using your coarse  cloth, and a little scouring soap, then rinse well in tepid water,  followed by a second rinsing in cold water, drain, and wipe dry. A  flat-bottomed boiler is best--with one rounding, there is greater risk  of scorching. Set a rack on the bottom else an old dish or earthen  pieplate, pour in an inch of water, set over the fire, lay the ham upon  the rack, skin side down, and fill up with cold water till it stands two  inches above the meat. Take care in adding the water not to dislodge the  ham from the rack. Bring the water to a boil, throw in a pint of cold  water and skim the boiler very clean, going over it twice or three  times. After the last skimming add half a dozen whole cloves, a dozen  whole alspice, a pod of red pepper, a few whole grains of black pepper,  and if you like, a young onion or a stalk of celery. Personally I do  not like either onion or celery--moreover they taint the fat one may  save from the pot. Let the water boil hard for half a minute, no longer,  then slack heat till it barely simmers. Keep it simmering, filling up  the pot as the water in it boils away, until the ham is tender  throughout. The time depends on several things--the hardness and age of  the ham, weight, curing. Fifteen minutes to the pound, reckoned from the  beginning of simmering, is the standard allowance. I have no hard and  fast rule--my hams boil always until the fork pierces them readily, and  the hip-bone stands clear of flesh.    A big ham, fifteen to twenty pounds weight, had better be left in the  water overnight. A smaller one, say of ten pounds weight, should remain  only until thoroughly cold. Take up carefully when cold, let drain  twenty minutes, lying flesh side up in a flat dish, then trim off the  under side and edges neatly, removing rusty fat, strings, etc., and  cutting through the skin at the hock end. Turn over and remove the  skin--taking care not to tear away too much fat with it. Remove the ham  to a clean, deep dish, or bowl--the closer fitting the better, then pour  around it either sound claret, or sweet cider, till it stands half way  up the sides. Add a little tabasco or Worcester to the liquor, if high  flavors are approved. Then stick whole cloves in a lozenge pattern all  over the fat, sprinkle on thickly red and black pepper, and last of all,  sugar--brown sugar if to be had, but white will do.    Leave standing several hours, basting once or twice with the liquor in  the bowl. Take out, set on a rack in an agate pan, pour the liquor  underneath, and bake slowly one to two hours, according to size. Baste  every fifteen minutes, adding water as the liquor cooks away. Beware  scorching--the ham should be a beautiful speckly dark brown all over.  Let cool uncovered, and keep cool, but not on ice until eaten.    Drop a lump of ice in the boiling liquor unless the weather is  cold--then set it outside. As soon as the fat on top hardens take it  off, boil it fifteen minutes in clear water, chill, skim off, and  clarify by frying slices of raw potato in it. The spices will have sunk  to the bottom, and there will be no trace of their flavor in the fat.  Any boiling vegetable--cabbage, string beans, navy beans, greens in  general--may be cooked to advantage in the liquor. It also serves as an  excellent foundation for pea soup. Drain it off from the sediment,  reduce a trifle by quick boiling, then add the other things. Dumplings  of sound cornmeal, wet up stiff, shaped the size of an egg, and dropped  in the boiling liquor, furnish a luncheon dish cheap and appetizing.    Fried ham as Mammy made it is mostly a fragrant memory--only plutocrats  dare indulge in it these days. She cut thin slices from the juicy, thick  part of the ham, using a very sharp, clean knife. Then she trimmed away  the skin, and laid the slices in a clean, hot skillet--but not too hot.  In about a minute she flipped them over delicately, so as to sear the  other side. When enough fat had been tried out to bubble a bit, she  turned them again, then set the skillet off, deadened the coals beneath  it a little--put it back, and let the ham cook until tender through and  through. She never washed the slices nor even wiped them with damp  cloths. There was no need--her hands and knife were as clean as could  be. Washing and wiping spoiled the flavor, she said. I agree with her.  After the ham was taken up, she poured in milk, half cream, shook it  well about in the hissing hot fat until it had taken up all the  delicious brown essence caked on the skillet bottom. This milk gravy was  poured over the slices in the platter. A practice I have never  followed--my gravy is made with water rather than milk, and served  separately.    Invalids and gourmets may be indulged with boiled ham, broiled over live  coals. Slice very thin, lay for half a minute upon a shovel of glowing  fresh coals, take up in a very hot dish, butter liberally, dust with  pepper and serve very hot. To frizzle ham slice as thin as possible in  tiny bits, and toss the bits till curly-crisp in blazing hot butter.  Excellent as an appetizer or to raise a thirst.    For ham and eggs slice and fry as directed, take up, break fresh eggs  separately each in a saucer, and slip them into the fat when it is  bubbling hot. Dip hot fat over them to cook the upper side--take up with  a cake turner, and arrange prettily as a border around the ham. Sprigs  of watercress outside add to the appetizing effect. Serve with hot  biscuit, or waffles or muffins, and strong, clear coffee.    Tart apples cored but not peeled sliced in rings and fried in hot fat,  drained out and sprinkled lightly with sugar, add to the charm of even  the finest ham. So does hominy, the full-grained sort, boiled tender  beforehand, and fried till there is a thick, brown crust all over the  skillet bottom. The secret of these as of all other fryings, is to have  grease enough, make it hot enough to crisp whatever goes into it  instantly, then to watch so there shall be no scorching, and take out  what is fried as soon as done, draining well. Among the paradoxes of  cookery is this--frying with scant grease makes greasy eating, whereas  frying in deep fat, sufficiently hot, makes the reverse.    Sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced, deserve frying in ham fat. Well  drained, dusted with salt, pepper, and sugar, they are delicious, also  most digestible. Frying is indeed the method of cookery most misprised  through its abuse. In capable hands it achieves results no-otherwise  attainable.    A perfect mutton ham is a matter of grace no less premeditation. It must  be cut from a wether at least four years old, grass fed, grain finished,  neither too fat, nor too lean, scientifically butchered in clear,  frosty, but not freezing weather, and hung unsalted in clean, cold air  for a matter of three days. Saw off shank and hip bones neatly, and cut  the meat smooth, removing any tags and jags, then pack down in an agate  or clean wooden vessel that has been scalded, then chilled. Half cover  with a marinade thus proportioned. One pint pickling salt to one gallon  cold water, boil and skim clean, then add one pint vinegar, a dozen each  of whole cloves, allspice and pepper corns, a pod of red pepper, a  teaspoon of powdered saltpeter, and a small cup of oil. Simmer for half  an hour, and cool before pouring on the meat. Let it lie in the liquor a  week, turning it twice daily.

Sleipnir    When Odin took an active part in war, he generally rode his  eight-footed grey steed, Sleipnir, and bore a white shield. His  glittering spear flung over the heads of the combatants was the signal  for the fray to commence, and he would dash into the midst of the  ranks shouting his warcry: \"Odin has you all!\"          \"And Odin donned      His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold,      And led the way on Sleipnir.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      At times he used his magic bow, from which he would shoot ten arrows at  once, every one invariably bringing down a foe. Odin was also supposed  to inspire his favourite warriors with the renowned \"Berserker rage\"  (bare sark or shirt), which enabled them, although naked, weaponless,  and sore beset, to perform unheard-of feats of valour and strength,  and move about as with charmed lives.    As Odin's characteristics, like the all-pervading elements, were  multitudinous, so also were his names, of which he had no less than  two hundred, almost all descriptive of some phase of his activities. He  was considered the ancient god of seamen and of the wind.                  \"Mighty Odin,        Norsemen hearts we bend to thee!      Steer our barks, all-potent Woden,        O'er the surging Baltic Sea.\"                Vail.        The Wild Hunt    Odin, as wind-god, was pictured as rushing through mid-air on his  eight-footed steed, from which originated the oldest Northern riddle,  which runs as follows: \"Who are the two who ride to the Thing? Three  eyes have they together, ten feet, and one tail: and thus they travel  through the lands.\" And as the souls of the dead were supposed to be  wafted away on the wings of the storm, Odin was worshipped as the  leader of all disembodied spirits. In this character he was most  generally known as the Wild Huntsman, and when people heard the  rush and roar of the wind they cried aloud in superstitious fear,  fancying they heard and saw him ride past with his train, all mounted  on snorting steeds, and accompanied by baying hounds. And the passing  of the Wild Hunt, known as Woden's Hunt, the Raging Host, Gabriel's  Hounds, or Asgardreia, was also considered a presage of such misfortune  as pestilence or war.          \"The Rhine flows bright; but its waves ere long        Must hear a voice of war,      And a clash of spears our hills among,        And a trumpet from afar;      And the brave on a bloody turf must lie,      For the Huntsman hath gone by!\"                The Wild Huntsman (Mrs. Hemans).      It was further thought that if any were so sacrilegious as to join  in the wild halloo in mockery, they would be immediately snatched up  and whirled away with the vanishing host, while those who joined in  the halloo with implicit good faith would be rewarded by the sudden  gift of a horse's leg, hurled at them from above, which, if carefully  kept until the morrow, would be changed into a lump of gold.    Even after the introduction of Christianity the ignorant Northern  folk still dreaded the on-coming storm, declaring that it was the  Wild Hunt sweeping across the sky.                          \"And ofttimes will start,      For overhead are sweeping Gabriel's hounds,          Doomed with their impious lord the flying hart      To chase forever on aereal grounds.\"                Sonnet (Wordsworth).      Sometimes it left behind a small black dog, which, cowering and  whining upon a neighbouring hearth, had to be kept for a whole year and  carefully tended unless it could be exorcised or frightened away. The  usual recipe, the same as for the riddance of changelings, was to brew  beer in egg-shells, and this performance was supposed so to startle  the spectral dog that he would fly with his tail between his legs,  exclaiming that, although as old as the Behmer, or Bohemian forest,  he had never before beheld such an uncanny sight.          \"I am as old      As the Behmer wold,      And have in my life      Such a brewing not seen.\"                Old Saying (Thorpe's tr.)      The object of this phantom hunt varied greatly, and was either a  visonary boar or wild horse, white-breasted maidens who were caught  and borne away bound only once in seven years, or the wood nymphs,  called Moss Maidens, who were thought to represent the autumn leaves  torn from the trees and whirled away by the wintry gale.    In the middle ages, when the belief in the old heathen deities  was partly forgotten, the leader of the Wild Hunt was no longer  Odin, but Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa, King Arthur, or some  Sabbath-breaker, like the Squire of Rodenstein or Hans von Hackelberg,  who, in punishment for his sins, was condemned to hunt for ever  through the realms of air.    As the winds blew fiercest in autumn and winter, Odin was supposed to  prefer hunting during that season, especially during the time between  Christmas and Twelfth-night, and the peasants were always careful to  leave the last sheaf or measure of grain out in the fields to serve  as food for his horse.    This hunt was of course known by various names in the different  countries of Northern Europe; but as the tales told about it are  all alike, they evidently originated in the same old heathen belief,  and to this day ignorant people of the North fancy that the baying  of a hound on a stormy night is an infallible presage of death.          \"Still, still shall last the dreadful chase,        Till time itself shall have an end;      By day, they scour earth's cavern'd space,        At midnight's witching hour, ascend.        \"This is the horn, and hound, and horse        That oft the lated peasant hears;      Appall'd, he signs the frequent cross,        When the wild din invades his ears.        \"The wakeful priest oft drops a tear        For human pride, for human woe,      When, at his midnight mass, he hears        The infernal cry of 'Holla, ho!'\"                Sir Walter Scott.      The Wild Hunt, or Raging Host of Germany, was called Herlathing  in England, from the mythical king Herla, its supposed leader; in  Northern France it bore the name of Mesnee d'Hellequin, from Hel,  goddess of death; and in the middle ages it was known as Cain's Hunt  or Herod's Hunt, these latter names being given because the leaders  were supposed to be unable to find rest on account of the iniquitous  murders of Abel, of John the Baptist, and of the Holy Innocents.    In Central France the Wild Huntsman, whom we have already seen in  other countries as Odin, Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Rodenstein, von  Hackelberg, King Arthur, Hel, one of the Swedish kings, Gabriel,  Cain, or Herod, is also called the Great Huntsman of Fontainebleau  (le Grand Veneur de Fontainebleau), and people declare that on the  eve of Henry IV.'s murder, and also just before the outbreak of the  great French Revolution, his shouts were distinctly heard as he swept  across the sky.    It was generally believed among the Northern nations that the soul  escaped from the body in the shape of a mouse, which crept out of  a corpse's mouth and ran away, and it was also said to creep in and  out of the mouths of people in a trance. While the soul was absent,  no effort or remedy could recall the patient to life; but as soon as  it had come back animation returned.        The Pied Piper    As Odin was the leader of all disembodied spirits, he was identified in  the middle ages with the Pied Piper of Hamelin. According to mediaeval  legends, Hamelin was so infested by rats that life became unbearable,  and a large reward was offered to any who would rid the town of these  rodents. A piper, in parti-coloured garments, offered to undertake  the commission, and the terms being accepted, he commenced to play  through the streets in such wise that, one and all, the rats were  beguiled out of their holes until they formed a vast procession. There  was that in the strains which compelled them to follow, until at last  the river Weser was reached, and all were drowned in its tide.          \"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,      You heard as if an army muttered;      And the muttering grew to a grumbling;      And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;      And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.      Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,      Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,      Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,        Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,      Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,        Families by tens and dozens,      Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--      Followed the Piper for their lives.      From street to street he piped advancing,      And step for step they followed dancing,      Until they came to the river Weser,      Wherein all plunged and perished!\"                Robert Browning.      As the rats were all dead, and there was no chance of their returning  to plague them, the people of Hamelin refused to pay the reward, and  they bade the piper do his worst. He took them at their word, and a  few moments later the weird strains of the magic flute again arose,  and this time it was the children who swarmed out of the houses and  merrily followed the piper.          \"There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling      Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;      Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,      Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,      And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,      Out came all the children running.
