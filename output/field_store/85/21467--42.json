[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3268"],[0,"The Mysteries of Udolpho (#6)"],[1," benevolent God designed to be  the sun-shine of our lives. My dear Emily, recollect and practise the  precepts I have so often given you, and which your own experience has so  often shewn you to be wise.    'Your sorrow is useless. Do not receive this as merely a commonplace  remark, but let reason THEREFORE restrain sorrow. I would not annihilate  your feelings, my child, I would only teach you to command them; for  whatever may be the evils resulting from a too susceptible heart,  nothing can be hoped from an insensible one; that, on the other hand,  is all vice--vice, of which the deformity is not softened, or the effect  consoled for, by any semblance or possibility of good. You know my  sufferings, and are, therefore, convinced that mine are not the light  words which, on these occasions, are so often repeated to destroy even  the sources of honest emotion, or which merely display the selfish  ostentation of a false philosophy. I will shew my Emily, that I can  practise what I advise. I have said thus much, because I cannot bear to  see you wasting in useless sorrow, for want of that resistance which  is due from mind; and I have not said it till now, because there is  a period when all reasoning must yield to nature; that is past: and  another, when excessive indulgence, having sunk into habit, weighs  down the elasticity of the spirits so as to render conquest nearly  impossible; this is to come. You, my Emily, will shew that you are  willing to avoid it.'    Emily smiled through her tears upon her father: 'Dear sir,' said she,  and her voice trembled; she would have added, 'I will shew myself worthy  of being your daughter;' but a mingled emotion of gratitude, affection,  and grief overcame her. St. Aubert suffered her to weep without  interruption, and then began to talk on common topics.    The first person who came to condole with St. Aubert was a M. Barreaux,  an austere and seemingly unfeeling man. A taste for botany had  introduced them to each other, for they had frequently met in their  wanderings among the mountains. M. Barreaux had retired from the world,  and almost from society, to live in a pleasant chateau, on the skirts of  the woods, near La Vallee. He also had been disappointed in his opinion  of mankind; but he did not, like St. Aubert, pity and mourn for them;  he felt more indignation at their vices, than compassion for their  weaknesses.    St. Aubert was somewhat surprised to see him; for, though he had often  pressed him to come to the chateau, he had never till now accepted the  invitation; and now he came without ceremony or reserve, entering the  parlour as an old friend. The claims of misfortune appeared to have  softened down all the ruggedness and prejudices of his heart. St. Aubert  unhappy, seemed to be the sole idea that occupied his mind. It was in  manners, more than in words, that he appeared to sympathize with his  friends: he spoke little on the subject of their grief; but the minute  attention he gave them, and the modulated voice, and softened look that  accompanied it, came from his heart, and spoke to theirs.    At this melancholy period St. Aubert was likewise visited by Madame  Cheron, his only surviving sister, who had been some years a widow, and  now resided on her own estate near Tholouse. The intercourse between  them had not been very frequent. In her condolements, words were not  wanting; she understood not the magic of the look that speaks at once  to the soul, or the voice that sinks like balm to the heart: but she  assured St. Aubert that she sincerely sympathized with him, praised the  virtues of his late wife, and then offered what she considered to be  consolation. Emily wept unceasingly while she spoke; St. Aubert was  tranquil, listened to what she said in silence, and then turned the  discourse upon another subject.    At parting she pressed him and her niece to make her an early visit.  'Change of place will amuse you,' said she, 'and it is wrong to give way  to grief.' St. Aubert acknowledged the truth of these words of course;  but, at the same time, felt more reluctant than ever to quit the spot  which his past happiness had consecrated. The presence of his wife  had sanctified every surrounding scene, and, each day, as it gradually  softened the acuteness of his suffering, assisted the tender enchantment  that bound him to home.    But there were calls which must be complied with, and of this kind was  the visit he paid to his brother-in-law M. Quesnel. An affair of an  interesting nature made it necessary that he should delay this visit no  longer, and, wishing to rouse Emily from her dejection, he took her with  him to Epourville.    As the carriage entered upon the forest that adjoined his paternal  domain, his eyes once more caught, between the chesnut avenue, the  turreted corners of the chateau. He sighed to think of what had passed  since he was last there, and that it was now the property of a man who  neither revered nor valued it. At length he entered the avenue, whose  lofty trees had so often delighted him when a boy, and whose melancholy  shade was now so congenial with the tone of his spirits. Every feature  of the edifice, distinguished by an air of heavy grandeur, appeared  successively between the branches of the trees--the broad turret, the  arched gate-way that led into the courts, the drawbridge, and the dry  fosse which surrounded the whole.    The sound of carriage wheels brought a troop of servants to the great  gate, where St. Aubert alighted, and from which he led Emily into the  gothic hall, now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the  family. These were displaced, and the oak wainscotting, and beams that  crossed the roof, were painted white. The large table, too, that used to  stretch along the upper end of the hall, where the master of the mansion  loved to display his hospitality, and whence the peal of laughter, and  the song of conviviality, had so often resounded, was now removed; even  the benches that had surrounded the hall were no longer there. The heavy  walls were hung with frivolous ornaments, and every thing that appeared  denoted the false taste and corrupted sentiments of the present owner.    St. Aubert followed a gay Parisian servant to a parlour, where sat Mons.  and Madame Quesnel, who received him with a stately politeness, and,  after a few formal words of condolement, seemed to have forgotten that  they ever had a sister.    Emily felt tears swell into her eyes, and then resentment checked them.  St. Aubert, calm and deliberate, preserved his dignity without assuming  importance, and Quesnel was depressed by his presence without exactly  knowing wherefore.    After some general conversation, St. Aubert requested to speak with him  alone; and Emily, being left with Madame Quesnel, soon learned that a  large party was invited to dine at the chateau, and was compelled to  hear that nothing which was past and irremediable ought to prevent the  festivity of the present hour.    St. Aubert, when he was told that company were expected, felt a mixed  emotion of disgust and indignation against the insensibility of Quesnel,  which prompted him to return home immediately. But he was informed, that  Madame Cheron had been asked to meet him; and, when he looked at Emily,  and considered that a time might come when the enmity of her uncle would  be prejudicial to her, he determined not to incur it himself, by conduct  which would be resented as indecorous, by the very persons who now  showed so little sense of decorum.    Among the visitors assembled at dinner were two Italian gentlemen, of  whom one was named Montoni, a distant relation of Madame Quesnel, a man  about forty, of an uncommonly handsome person, with features manly and  expressive, but whose countenance exhibited, upon the whole, more of the  haughtiness of command, and the quickness of discernment, than of any  other character.    Signor Cavigni, his friend, appeared to be about thirty--inferior in  dignity, but equal to him in penetration of countenance, and superior in  insinuation of manner.    Emily was shocked by the salutation with which Madame Cheron met her  father--'Dear brother,' said she, 'I am concerned to see you look so  very ill; do, pray, have advice!' St. Aubert answered, with a melancholy  smile, that he felt himself much as usual; but Emily's fears made her  now fancy that her father looked worse than he really did.    Emily would have been amused by the new characters she saw, and the  varied conversation that passed during dinner, which was served in a  style of splendour she had seldom seen before, had her spirits been less  oppressed. Of the guests, Signor Montoni was lately come from Italy, and  he spoke of the commotions which at that period agitated the country;  talked of party differences with warmth, and then lamented the probable  consequences of the tumults. His friend spoke with equal ardour, of  the politics of his country; praised the government and prosperity  of Venice, and boasted of its decided superiority over all the other  Italian states. He then turned to the ladies, and talked with the same  eloquence, of Parisian fashions, the French opera, and French manners;  and on the latter subject he did not fail to mingle what is so  particularly agreeable to French taste. The flattery was not detected  by those to whom it was addressed, though its effect, in producing  submissive attention, did not escape his observation. When he could  disengage himself from the assiduities of the other ladies, he sometimes  addressed Emily: but she knew nothing of Parisian fashions, or Parisian  operas; and her modesty, simplicity, and correct manners formed a  decided contrast to those of her female companions.    After dinner, St. Aubert stole from the room to view once more the old  chesnut which Quesnel talked of cutting down. As he stood under its  shade, and looked up among its branches, still"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#6)"],[1,"slant, it _shrank_!    This, too, the Atlanteans hoped, was new--a synthetic which air-friction  would erode away, molecule by molecule, so rapidly that no perceptible  fragment of it would reach ground.    The casing disappeared, and the yielding porous lining. And Phryges,  still at an altitude of over thirty thousand feet, kicked away the  remaining fragments of his cocoon and, by judicious planning, turned  himself so that he could see the ground, now dimly visible in the first  dull gray of dawn. There was the highway, paralleling his line of  flight; he wouldn't miss it more than a hundred yards.    He fought down an almost overwhelming urge to pull his rip-cord too  soon. He had to wait--wait until the last possible second--because  parachutes were big and Norheiman radar practically swept the ground.    Low enough at last, he pulled the ring. Z-r-r-e-e-k--WHAP! The chute  banged open; his harness tightened with a savage jerk, mere seconds  before his hard-sprung knees took the shock of landing.    That was close--too close! He was white and shaking, but unhurt, as he  gathered in the billowing, fighting sheet and rolled it, together with  his harness, into a wad. He broke open a tiny ampoule, and as the drops  of liquid touched it the stout fabric began to disappear. It did not  burn; it simply disintegrated and vanished. In less than a minute there  remained only a few steel snaps and rings, which the Atlantean buried  under a meticulously-replaced circle of sod.    He was still on schedule. In less than three minutes the signals would  be on the air and he would know where he was--unless the Norsks had  succeeded in finding and eliminating the whole Atlantean under-cover  group. He pressed a stud on a small instrument; held it down. A line  burned green across the dial--flared red--vanished.    \"Damn!\" he breathed, explosively. The strength of the signal told him  that he was within a mile or so of the hide-out--first-class  computation--but the red flash warned him to keep away. Kinnexa--_it had  better be Kinnexa!_--would come to him.    How? By air? Along the road? Through the woods on foot? He had no way of  knowing--talking, even on a tight beam, was out of the question. He made  his way to the highway and crouched behind a tree. Here she could come  at him by any route of the three. Again he waited, pressing infrequently  a stud of his sender.    A long, low-slung ground-car swung around the curve and Phryges'  binoculars were at his eyes. It was Kinnexa--or a duplicate. At the  thought he dropped his glasses and pulled his guns--blaster in right  hand, air-pistol in left. But no, that wouldn't do. She'd be suspicious,  too--she'd have to be--and that car probably mounted heavy stuff. If he  stepped out ready for business she'd fry him, and quick. Maybe not--she  might have protection--but he couldn't take the chance.    The car slowed; stopped. The girl got out, examined a front tire,  straightened up, and looked down the road, straight at Phryges' hiding  place. This time the binoculars brought her up to little more than arm's  length. Tall, blonde, beautifully built; the slightly crooked left  eyebrow. The thread-line of gold betraying a one-tooth bridge and the  tiny scar on her upper lip, for both of which he had been  responsible--she always did insist on playing cops-and-robbers with boys  older and bigger than herself--it _was_ Kinnexa! Not even Norheim's  science could imitate so perfectly every personalizing characteristic of  a girl he had known ever since she was knee-high to a duck!    The girl slid back into her seat and the heavy car began to move.  Open-handed, Phryges stepped out into its way. The car stopped.    \"Turn around. Back up to me, hands behind you,\" she directed, crisply.    The man, although surprised, obeyed. Not until he felt a finger  exploring the short hair at the back of his neck did he realize what she  was seeking--the almost imperceptible scar marking the place where she  bit him when she was seven years old!    \"Oh, Fry! It _is_ you! _Really_ you! Thank the gods! I've been ashamed  of that all my life, but now....\"    He whirled and caught her as she slumped, but she did not quite faint.    \"Quick! Get in ... drive on ... not too fast!\" she cautioned, sharply,  as the tires began to scream. \"The speed limit along here is seventy,  and we can't be picked up.\"    \"Easy it is, Kinny. But _give_! What's the score? Where's Kolanides? Or  rather, what happened to him?\"    \"Dead. So are the others, I think. They put him on a psycho-bench and  turned him inside out.\"    \"But the blocks?\"    \"Didn't hold--over here they add such trimmings as skinning and salt to  the regular psycho routine. But none of them knew anything about me, nor  about how their reports were picked up, or I'd have been dead, too. But  it doesn't make any difference, Fry--we're just one week too late.\"    \"What do you mean, too late? Speed it up!\" His tone was rough, but the  hand he placed on her arm was gentleness itself.    \"I'm telling you as fast as I can. I picked up his last report day  before yesterday. They have missiles just as big and just as fast as  ours--maybe more so--and they are going to fire one at Atlantis tonight  at exactly seven o'clock.\"    \"Tonight! Holy gods!\" The man's mind raced.    \"Yes.\" Kinnexa's voice was low, uninflected. \"And there was nothing in  the world that I could do about it. If I approached any one of our  places, or tried to use a beam strong enough to reach anywhere, I would  simply have got picked up, too. I've thought and thought, but could  figure out only one thing that might possibly be of any use, and I  couldn't do that alone. But two of us, perhaps....\"    \"Go on. Brief me. Nobody ever accused you of not having a brain, and you  know this whole country like the palm of your hand.\"    \"Steal a ship. Be over the ramp at exactly Seven Pay Emma. When the lid  opens, go into a full-power dive, beam Artomenes--if I had a second  before they blanketed my wave--and meet their rocket head-on in their  own launching-tube.\"    This was stark stuff, but so tense was the moment and so highly keyed up  were the two that neither of them saw anything out of the ordinary in  it.    \"Not bad, if we can't figure out anything better. The joker being, of  course, that you didn't see how you could steal a ship?\"    \"Exactly. I can't carry blasters. No woman in Norheim is wearing a coat  or a cloak now, so I can't either. And just look at this dress! Do you  see any place where I could hide even one?\"    He looked, appreciatively, and she had the grace to blush.    \"Can't say that I do,\" he admitted. \"But I'd rather have one of our own  ships, if we could make the approach. Could both of us make it, do you  suppose?\"    \"Not a chance. They'd keep at least one man inside all the time. Even if  we killed everybody outside, the ship would take off before we could get  close enough to open the port with the outside controls.\"    \"Probably. Go on. But first, are you sure that you're in the clear?\"    \"Positive.\" She grinned mirthlessly. \"The fact that I am still alive is  conclusive evidence that they didn't find out anything about me. But I  don't want you to work on that idea if you can think of a better one.  I've got passports and so on for you to be anything you want to be, from  a tube-man up to an Ekoptian banker. Ditto for me, and for us both, as  Mr. and Mrs.\"    \"Smart girl.\" He thought for minutes, then shook his head. \"No possible  way out that I can see. The sneak-boat isn't due for a week, and from  what you've said it probably won't get here. But you might make it, at  that. I'll drop you somewhere....\"    \"You will not,\" she interrupted, quietly but definitely. \"Which would  _you_ rather--go out in a blast like that one will be, beside a good  Atlantean, or, after deserting him, be psychoed, skinned, salted,  and--still alive--drawn and quartered?\"    \"Together, then, all the way,\" he assented. \"Man and wife.  Tourists--newlyweds--from some town not too far away. Pretty well fixed,  to match what we're riding in. Can do?\"    \"Very simple.\" She opened a compartment and selected one of a stack of  documents. \"I can fix this one up in ten minutes. We'll have to dispose  of the rest of these, and a lot of other stuff, too. And you had better  get out of that leather and into a suit that matches this passport  photo.\"    \"Right. Straight road for miles, and nothing in sight either way. Give  me the suit and I'll change now. Keep on going or stop?\"    \"Better stop, I think,\" the girl decided. \"Quicker, and we'll have to  find a place to hide or bury this evidence.\"    While the man changed clothes, Kinnexa collected the contraband,  wrapping it up in the discarded jacket. She looked up just as Phryges  was adjusting his coat. She glanced at his armpits, then stared.    \"Where are your blasters?\" she demanded. \"They ought to show, at least a  little, and even I can't see a sign of them.\"    He showed her.    \"But they're so tiny! I never saw blasters like that!\"    \"I've got a blaster, but it's in the tail pocket. These aren't. They're  air-guns. Poisoned needles. Not worth a damn beyond a hundred feet, but  deadly close up. One touch anywhere and the guy dies right then. Two  seconds max.\"    \"Nice!\" She was no shrinking violet this young Atlantean spy. \"You have  spares, of course, and I can hide two of them easily enough in  leg-holsters. Gimme, and show me how they work.\"    \"Standard controls, pretty much like blasters. Like so.\" He  demonstrated, and as he drove sedately down the highway the girl sewed  industriously.    The day wore on, nor was it uneventful. One incident, in fact--the  detailing of which would serve no useful purpose here--was of such a  nature that at its end:    \"Better pin-point me, don't you think, on that ramp?\" Phryges asked,  quietly. \"Just in case you get scragged in one of these brawls and I  don't?\"    \"Oh! Of course!"]]]
