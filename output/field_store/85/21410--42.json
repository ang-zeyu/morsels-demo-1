Among  the material is to be found a small rectangular board, the surface of  which is divided into two parts--rough and smooth. (Fig. 13.) The  child knows already how to wash his hands with cold water and soap; he  then dries them and dips the tips of his fingers for a few seconds in  tepid water. Graduated exercises for the thermic sense may also have  their place here, as has been explained in my book on the \"Method.\"    After this, the child is taught to pass the soft cushioned tips of his  fingers _as lightly as possible_ over the two separate surfaces, that  he may appreciate their difference. The delicate _movement_ backwards  and forwards of the suspended hand, as it is brought into light  contact with the surface, is an excellent exercise in control. The  little hand, which has just been cleansed and given its tepid bath,  gains much in grace and beauty, and the whole exercise is the first  step in the education of the \"tactile sense,\" which holds such an  important place in my method.    When initiating the child into the education of the sense of touch,  the teacher must always take an active part the first time; not only  must she show the child \"how it is done,\" her interference is a little  more definite still, for she takes hold of his hand and guides it to  touch the surfaces with the finger-tips in the lightest possible way.  She will make no explanations; her words will be rather to _encourage_  the child with his hand to perceive the different sensations.    When he has perceived them, it is then that he repeats the act by  himself in the delicate way which he has been taught.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--BOARD WITH GUMMED STRIPS OF PAPER.]    After the board with the two contrasting surfaces, the child is  offered another board on which are gummed strips of paper which are  rough or smooth in different degrees. (Fig. 14.)    Graduated series of sandpaper cards are also given. The child perfects  himself by exercises in touching these surfaces, not only refining his  capacity for perceiving tactile differences which are always growing  more similar, but also perfecting the movement of which he is ever  gaining greater mastery.    Following these is a series of stuffs of every kind: velvets, satins,  silks, woolens, cottons, coarse and fine linens. There are two similar  pieces of each kind of stuff, and they are of bright and vivid  colors.    The child is now taught a new movement. Where before he had to  _touch_, he must now _feel_ the stuffs, which, according to the  degree of fineness or coarseness from coarse cotton to fine silk,  are felt with movements correspondingly decisive or delicate. The  child whose hand is already practised finds the greatest pleasure  in feeling the stuffs, and, almost instinctively, in order to enhance  his appreciation of the tactile sensation he closes his eyes.  Then, to spare himself the exertion, he blindfolds himself with a  clean handkerchief, and as he feels the stuffs, he arranges the  similar pieces in pairs, one upon the other, then, taking off the  handkerchief, he ascertains for himself whether he has made any  mistake.    This exercise in _touching_ and _feeling_ is peculiarly attractive to  the child, and induces him to seek similar experiences in his  surroundings. A little one, attracted by the pretty stuff of a  visitor's dress, will be seen to go and wash his hands, then to come  and touch the stuff of the garment again and again with infinite  delicacy, his face meanwhile expressing his pleasure and interest.                      *       *       *       *       *    A little later we shall see the children interest themselves in a much  more difficult exercise.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--WOOD TABLETS DIFFERING IN WEIGHT.]    There are some little rectangular tablets which form part of the  material. (Fig. 15.) The tablets, though of identical size, are made  of wood of varying qualities, so that they differ in weight and,  through the property of the wood, in color also.    The child has to take a tablet and rest it delicately on the inner  surfaces of his four fingers, spreading them well out. This will be  another opportunity of teaching delicate movements.    The hand must move up and down as though to weigh the object, but the  movement must be as imperceptible as possible. These little movements  should diminish as the capacity and attention for perceiving the  weight of the object becomes more acute and the exercise will be  perfectly performed when the child comes to perceive the weight  almost without any movement of the hands. It is only by the repetition  of the attempts that such a result can be obtained.    Once the children are initiated into it by the teacher, they blindfold  their eyes and repeat by themselves these exercises of the _baric  sense_. For example, they lay the heavier wooden tablets on the right  and the lighter on the left.    When the child takes off the handkerchief, he can see by the color of  the pieces of wood if he has made a mistake.                      *       *       *       *       *    A long time before this difficult exercise, and during the period when  the child is working with the three sorts of geometrical solids and  with the rough and smooth tablets, he can be exercising himself with a  material which is very attractive to him.    This is the set of tablets covered with bright silk of shaded colors.  The set consists of two separate boxes each containing sixty-four  colors; that is, eight different tints, each of which has eight shades  carefully graded. The first exercise for the child is that of _pairing  the colors_; that is, he selects from a mixed heap of colors the two  tablets which are alike, and lays them out, one beside the other. The  teacher naturally does not offer the child all the one hundred and  twenty-eight tablets in a heap, but chooses only a few of the brighter  colors, for example, red, blue and yellow, and prepares and mixes up  three or four pairs. Then, taking one tablet--perhaps the red one--she  indicates to the child that he is to choose its counterpart from the  heap. This done, the teacher lays the pair together on the table. Then  she takes perhaps the blue and the child selects the tablet to form  another pair. The teacher then mixes the tablets again for the child  to repeat the exercise by himself, _i.e._, to select the two red  tablets, the two blue, the two yellow, etc., and to place the two  members of each pair next to one another.    Then the couples will be increased to four or five, and little  children of three years old end by pairing of their own accord ten or  a dozen couples of mixed tablets.    [Illustration: COLOR SPOOLS]    When the child has given his eye sufficient practise in recognizing  the identity of the pairs of colors, he is offered the shades of one  color only, and he exercises himself in the perception of the  slightest differences of shade in every color. Take, for example, the  blue series. There are eight tablets in graduated shades. The teacher  places them one beside another, beginning with the darkest, with the  sole object of making the child understand \"what is to be done.\"    She then leaves him alone to the interesting attempts which he  spontaneously makes. It often happens that the child makes a mistake.  If he has understood the idea and makes a mistake, it is a sign that  _he has not yet reached the stage_ of perceiving the differences  between the graduations of one color. It is practise which perfects in  the child that capacity for distinguishing the fine differences, and  so we leave him alone to his attempts!    There are two suggestions that we can make to help him. The first is  that he should always select the darkest color from the pile. This  suggestion greatly facilitates his choice by giving it a constant  direction.    Secondly, we can lead him to observe from time to time any two colors  that stand next to each other in order to compare them directly and  apart from the others. In this way the child does not place a tablet  without a particular and careful comparison with its neighbor.    Finally, the child himself will love to mix the sixty-four colors and  then to arrange them in eight rows of pretty shades of color with  really surprising skill. In this exercise also the child's hand is  educated to perform fine and delicate movements and his mind is  afforded special training in attention. He must not take hold of the  tablets anyhow, he must avoid touching the colored silk, and must  handle the tablets instead by the pieces of wood at the top and  bottom. To arrange the tablets next to one another in a straight line  at exactly the same level, so that the series looks like a beautiful  shaded ribbon, is an act which demands a manual skill only obtained  after considerable practise.                      *       *       *       *       *    These exercises of the chromatic sense lead, in the case of the older  children, to the development of the \"color memory.\" A child having  looked carefully at a color, is then invited to look for its companion  in a mixed group of colors, without, of course, keeping the color he  has observed under his eye to guide him. It is, therefore, by his  memory that he recognizes the color, which he no longer compares with  a reality but with an image impressed upon his mind.    The children are very fond of this exercise in \"color memory\"; it  makes a lively digression for them, as they run with the image of a  color in their minds and look for its corresponding reality in their  surroundings. It is a real triumph for them to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29691"],[0,"Taxidermy (#6)"],[1,"of poorest looking side, full length from gill to  tail fin.    If the specimen is to stand upon a pedestal of polished wood, with  supporting rods from the belly, make the incision along center of belly  full length. To prevent decay, stir three or four drops of forty per  cent solution of formalin into a quart of water.    Squeeze a cloth from this, leaving it pretty moist, and wrap the fish in  it, giving the wet cloth close contact with the skin. Do not apply  formalin inside any skin to be used for mounting. Never eat the flesh of  a fish thus kept.    Before skinning the fish, make careful outlines over him, both side and  top views. When skin is removed make outlines of skinned carcass.    Handle a fish very carefully when skinning and cleaning, moving the  specimen about or bending as little as possible during the entire  operation. Lay the head to your left. Open the skin with scissors and  make one long clean cut.    Lift edges of the skin and peel from flesh with a sharp knife or  scalpel. Cut off base of fins, when encountered, with scissors or bone  snips. Trim out most of skull with knife and bone snips, removing eyes  from inside. Be sure to scrape all flesh from cheek inside of gill  cover.    Remove flesh and fat from inside of skin with scraper, working from tail  toward head. Scrape out with point of small knife blade the flesh that  runs out thin over tail-fin bones.    This completes the skinning operation. The cleaned skin may be poisoned  to advantage with either dry or solution arsenic, brushed in well.    If the specimen is opened on the side for panel mounting and we wish to  follow a very simple method in mounting, one that is quite as practical  as it is simple, we must take a different step than outline sketches  before skinning. This is to make a complete body and head cast of the  best side in plaster of paris. This does not include the fins. To make  the cast neatly, lay the fish, best side up, in a slight hollow in a box  of clean, damp sand. Pack the sand up under the fish body smoothly so  that more than half of him rises in cameo style from the smooth surface.    Make up enough plaster to do the cast at once. To mix plaster properly,  sprinkle it into the dish of water until a little will begin to stand  out dry above the surface. Then with a spoon sunk deep in it, gently  stir to evenness. It is then ready to pour. Before doing this, jar the  pan upon the table a time or two to cause any possible bubbles to rise.    Pour evenly over the fish, or better still, dip it on with the spoon.  The plaster should be thick enough to barely flow for making a proper  cast.    The pectoral fins are simply laid flat to the side in making the cast.    Allow the cast to set hard before lifting it and removing the fish.  Trim off the overlapping edge so that no undercut remains.    The cleaned and poisoned skin should lay in damp cloth over one night  and is then laid in accurate place back in the cast. Pour it nearly full  of medium thick plaster of paris, carefully mixed free of bubbles.    Settle a board, cut to approximate body outline but much smaller, into  the unset plaster and press the flap edges of the skin back together  over the board, molding edge of back and belly to round back away from  trimmed edge of mold. This must be all done with accuracy before the  plaster sets, but you will find it gives enough time. Do not work in a  strung-up, nervous way.    When the plaster is set hard, remove fish from mold, hold it upon palm  of left hand and tack edges of skin to back-board. (For general details  of this method see Fig. 21).    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    Screw the specimen to a piece of board and adjust fins, carding them  over little blocks and holding the cards with sharp toilet pins until  drying is completed.    See that the jaws set right. They should have gone into the mold in  proper relation to each other. Dig out the plaster in eye socket on show  side and set eye in a little fresh plaster.    A simple method of making a modelled mannikin for fish follows:    Have the freshly skinned body or sketches of same at hand. Cut a  soft-wood board core, making it some smaller than outline of carcass.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    Anchor into this two rigid supporting wires or rods as shown in Fig. 22.  Upon this board core wrap strongly and smoothly with thread or small  cord a quantity of manila fiber to same shape of body but one-half to  three-quarters inch smaller than the body. Over this apply plaster of  paris and manila fiber (dipping the fiber and laying it on) to  approximate size of natural body. When this is set hard, pare it  smoothly into outlines of natural shape and gouge out slight grooves for  fin bases to set into. (See Fig. 23.).    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    Mannikins of this type should be dried out as quickly as possible and  shellaced before applying the skin. Apply the fish skin with a paste of  compo. No. I. Card the fins as in Fig. 24.    Fill the face through mouth and eyes with plaster of paris with a  little chopped manila fiber worked into it. Use a slight amount of glue  in the water to prevent rapid setting of the plaster. Hold face in place  until set, with light wrapping of soft cord, using care that it does not  crease soft parts.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    Special fish eyes may be procured at any dealers in taxidermists'  supplies. As the last detail of mounting, set the eyes. In all kinds of  specimens use a size of eyes that pass through the lids easily without  the need of stretching to admit them. A panel-fish needs but one eye as  a rule.    When the specimen is dry apply a coat of thin shellac as a filler to  the surface to paint upon. This filler should be very thin and leave  only a suggestion of gloss.    Use oil colors and apply as little pigment as may be used for the  effect. Kerosene oil is an ideal thinning medium for tube oil colors.  Have very little paint upon the brush when applying the tints to a fish  or reptile skin.    A suggestion of natural hues and markings will be found more  satisfactory than painting them on heavily. In a day or two when the  paint is dry apply a very thin coat of alcohol-cut picture varnish.  Turps-cut varnish is liable to loosen the paint, thus necessitating  entire re-finishing. Fasten a panel fish to the setting that is to frame  him, with two screws at least, countersinking their heads in the panel  back.    The fish piece may be hung as a picture, with screw eyes and cord or it  may be hung with one or two sheet metal slots countersunk into the panel  back. This will allow the piece to be applied flat to any wall that will  hold screws.    Large fishes mounted with rods for pedestal setting should have rods  threaded at both ends for nuts. Upper ends that support core board  should be bent as shown in Fig. 25. This figure also shows complete  method of setting both rod and wire supports in body core and permanent  stand.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]      PREPARING AND MOUNTING A SMALL HARD SHELLED TURTLE    For the purpose of skinning a hard shelled turtle (soft shelled species  are best unattempted) the belly plate is sawed open as shown in Fig. 26.  A piece of hacksaw blade may be shaped and set into a firm handle with  cross pegs of metal, for this purpose, or the small saw found in a  hollow handle tool kit may serve. Four corner holes must be bored by  which to start the sawing, which, for ease in accomplishing, may be thus  done upon straight lines.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    Through the sawed opening remove the viscera. With scissors and bone  snips, free the legs at their joints with the back shell, cut the neck  and tail vertebrae free and pull all these members inside out through  the opened shell. Skin the head to well down behind the eye sockets,  uncovering most of the jaw muscles and stopping where the skin and skull  are joined directly on the crown.    Cut the neck off. Clean out jaw meat, tongue, and brain. Turn head right  side out and with a stiff wire hook pull out the eyeballs.    Skin legs clear to toes and remove flesh cleanly from bones.    Skin tail out carefully. In many species this has to be split on under  side to remove bone. Dry the shell out with a bit of rag.    Poison well with arsenic water and let stand over one night, covered  with a damp cloth.    A simple method of mounting turtles, that will be found satisfactory for  decorative work, is clearly shown in Figs. 27 and 28.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    A light tow neck is wrapped upon the neck-wire, which is cut about twice  the length of the head and neck-skin, and has a small loop bent into it  near its outer end, to set into the brain cavity and a loop by front and  one by back end of belly opening to hold leg-wires. The front end is  run out through the nose. Legs are wired as in a mammal with wires bound  firmly to bones with thread or cord. Bones are then covered with a light  wrapping of tow, placed lightly and smoothly. This serves only as a core  to the filling. Tail is wrapped upon wire to natural size.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]    Legs are now pushed back into place, wires of them and tail are passed  through loops in body-wire and twisted around it once or twice, and then  leg-wires are led to drilled holes in edge of shell and clinched in them  as shown in Fig. 27.    Now tie or pin the mouth shut. Legs and head and neck are next filled  with sawdust, tamped in with a blunt piece of rod or wire or piece of  wood shaped for the purpose. Fill in the front legs and head first and  stuff some tow behind them to hold the sawdust in place when the  specimen is reversed to fill hind legs. After these are filled, stuff  the shell full of tow.    Position the turtle and wire upon a piece of board for a temporary base.    Finish shaping with a whittled modeling tool. Stuff the skin in front of  hind legs into proper concavity with wads of tow or cotton and leave  these until the"]]]
