With regard, however, to Venus and Mercury, the problem is by no means  such an easy one, as these bodies have no satellites. For information in  this latter case we have to rely upon such uncertain evidence as, for  instance, the slight disturbances caused in the motion of the earth by  the attraction of these planets when they pass closest to us, or their  observed effect upon the motions of such comets as may happen to pass  near to them.    Mass and weight, though often spoken of as one and the same thing, are  by no means so. Mass, as we have seen, merely means the amount of matter  which a body contains. The weight of a body, on the other hand, depends  entirely upon the gravitational pull which it receives. The force of  gravity at the surface of the earth is, for instance, about six times as  great as that at the surface of the moon. All bodies, therefore, weigh  about six times as much on the earth as they would upon the moon; or,  rather, a body transferred to the moon's surface would weigh only about  one-sixth of what it did on the terrestrial surface. It will therefore  be seen that if a body of given _mass_ were to be placed upon planet  after planet in turn, its _weight_ would regularly alter according to  the force of gravity at each planet's surface.    Gravitation is indeed one of the greatest mysteries of nature. What it  is, the means by which it acts, or why such a force should exist at all,  are questions to which so far we have not had even the merest hint of an  answer. Its action across space appears to be instantaneous.    The intensity of gravitation is said in mathematical parlance \"to vary  inversely with the square of the distance.\" This means that at _twice_  the distance the pull will become only _one-quarter_ as strong, and not  one-half as otherwise might be expected. At _four_ times the distance,  therefore, it will be _one-sixteenth_ as strong. At the earth's surface  a body is pulled by the earth's gravitation, or \"falls,\" as we  ordinarily term it, through 16 feet in one _second_ of time; whereas at  the distance of the moon the attraction of the earth is so very much  weakened that a body would take as long as one _minute_ to fall through  the same space.    Newton's investigations showed that if a body were to be placed _at  rest_ in space entirely away from the attraction of any other body it  would remain always in a motionless condition, because there would  plainly be no reason why it should move in any one direction rather than  in another. And, similarly, if a body were to be projected in a certain  direction and at a certain speed, it would move always in the same  direction and at the same speed so long as it did not come within the  gravitational attraction of any other body.    The possibility of an interaction between the celestial orbs had  occurred to astronomers before the time of Newton; for instance, in the  ninth century to the Arabian Musa-ben-Shakir, to Camillus Agrippa in  1553, and to Kepler, who suspected its existence from observation of the  tides. Horrox also, writing in 1635, spoke of the moon as moved by an  _emanation_ from the earth. But no one prior to Newton attempted to  examine the question from a mathematical standpoint.    Notwithstanding the acknowledged truth and far-reaching scope of the law  of gravitation--for we find its effects exemplified in every portion of  the universe--there are yet some minor movements which it does not  account for. For instance, there are small irregularities in the  movement of Mercury which cannot be explained by the influence of  possible intra-Mercurial planets, and similarly there are slight  unaccountable deviations in the motions of our neighbour the Moon.          CHAPTER V    CELESTIAL DISTANCES      Up to this we have merely taken a general view of the solar system--a  bird's-eye view, so to speak, from space.    In the course of our inquiry we noted in a rough way the _relative_  distances at which the various planets move around the sun. But we have  not yet stated what these distances _actually_ are, and it were  therefore well now to turn our attention to this important matter.    Each of us has a fair idea of what a mile is. It is a quarter of an  hour's sharp walk, for instance; or yonder village or building, we know,  lies such and such a number of miles away.    The measurements which have already been given of the diameters of the  various bodies of the solar system appear very great to us, who find  that a walk of a few miles at a time taxes our strength; but they are a  mere nothing when we consider the distances from the sun at which the  various planets revolve in their orbits.    The following table gives these distances in round numbers. As here  stated they are what are called \"mean\" distances; for, as the orbits are  oval, the planets vary in their distances from the sun, and we are  therefore obliged to strike a kind of average for each case:--    Mercury  about   36,000,000 miles.  Venus      \"     67,200,000  \"  Earth      \"     92,900,000  \"  Mars       \"    141,500,000  \"  Jupiter    \"    483,300,000  \"  Saturn     \"    886,000,000  \"  Uranus     \"  1,781,900,000  \"  Neptune    \"  2,791,600,000  \"    From the above it will be seen at a glance that we have entered upon a  still greater scale of distance than in dealing with the diameters of  the various bodies of the system. In that case the distances were  limited to thousands of miles; in this, however, we have to deal with  millions. A million being ten hundred thousand, it will be noticed that  even the diameter of the huge sun is well under a million miles.    How indeed are we to get a grasp of such distances, when those to which  we are ordinarily accustomed--the few miles' walk, the little stretch of  sea or land which we gaze upon around us--are so utterly minute in  comparison? The fact is, that though men may think that they can picture  in their minds such immense distances, they actually can not. In matters  like these we unconsciously employ a kind of convention, and we estimate  a thing as being two or three or more times the size of another. More  than this we are unable to do. For instance, our ordinary experience of  a mile enables us to judge, in a way, of a stretch of several miles,  such as one can take in with a glance; but in our estimation of a  thousand miles, or even of one hundred, we are driven back upon a mental  trick, so to speak.    In our attempts to realise such immense distances as those in the solar  system we are obliged to have recourse to analogies; to comparisons with  other and simpler facts, though this is at the best a mere self-cheating  device. The analogy which seems most suited to our purpose here, and one  which has often been employed by writers, is borrowed from the rate at  which an express train travels.    Let us imagine, for instance, that we possess an express train which is  capable of running anywhere, never stops, never requires fuel, and  always goes along at sixty miles an hour. Suppose we commence by  employing it to gauge the size of our own planet, the earth. Let us send  it on a trip around the equator, the span of which is about 24,000  miles. At its sixty-miles-an-hour rate of going, this journey will take  nearly 17 days. Next let us send it from the earth to the moon. This  distance, 240,000 miles, being ten times as great as the last, will of  course take ten times as long to cover, namely, 170 days; that is to  say, nearly half a year. Again, let us send it still further afield, to  the sun, for example. Here, however, it enters upon a journey which is  not to be measured in thousands of miles, as the others were, but in  millions. The distance from the earth to the sun, as we have seen in the  foregoing table, is about 93 millions of miles. Our express train would  take about 178 _years_ to traverse this.    Having arrived at the sun, let us suppose that our train makes a tour  right round it. This will take more than five years.    Supposing, finally, that our train were started from the sun, and made  to run straight out to the known boundaries of the solar system, that is  to say, as far as the orbit of Neptune, it would take over 5000 years to  traverse the distance.    That sixty miles an hour is a very great speed any one, I think, will  admit who has stood upon the platform of a country station while one of  the great mail trains has dashed past. But are not the immensities of  space appalling to contemplate, when one realises that a body moving  incessantly at such a rate would take so long as 10,000 years to  traverse merely the breadth of our solar system? Ten thousand years!  Just try to conceive it. Why, it is only a little more than half that  time since the Pyramids were built, and they mark for us the Dawn of  History. And since then half-a-dozen mighty empires have come and gone!    Having thus concluded our general survey of the appearance and  dimensions of the solar system, let us next inquire into its position  and size in relation to what we call the Universe.    A mere glance at the night sky, when it is free from clouds, shows us  that in every direction there are stars; and this holds good, no matter  what portion of the globe we visit. The same is really true of the sky  by day, though in that case we cannot actually see the stars, for their  light is quite overpowered by the dazzling light of the sun.    We thus reach the conclusion that our earth, that our solar system in  fact, lies plunged within the midst of a great tangle of stars. What  position, by the way, do we occupy in this mighty maze? Are we at the  centre, or anywhere near the centre, or where?    It has been indeed amply proved by astronomical research that the stars  are bodies giving off a light of their own, just as our sun does; that  they are in fact suns, and that our sun is merely one, perhaps indeed a  very unimportant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],[0,"Letters on an Elk Hunt (#6)"],[1,"to sell it. That was years ago.  We came West. The country was really wild then; there was a great  deal of lawlessness. We didn't get settled down for several years; we  hired to a man who had a contract to put up hay for the government,  and we worked for him for a long time.    \"Indians were thick as fleas on a dog then; some were camped near  us once, and among them was a Mexican woman who could jabber a  little English. Once, when I was feeling particularly resentful and  sorrowful, I told her about my little Dave; and it was her jabbered  words that showed me the way to peace. I wept for hours, but peace had  come and has stayed. Ambition came again, but a different kind: I  wanted the same peace to come to all hearts that came so late to mine,  and I wanted to help bring it. I took the only course I knew. I have  gone to others' help every time there has been a chance. After Fanny  married and Dave died, I had an ambition to save up four hundred  dollars with which to buy an entrance into an old ladies' home. Just  before I got the full amount saved up, I found that young Eddie  Carwell wanted to enter the ministry and needed help to go to college.  I had just enough; so I gave it to him. Another time I had almost  enough, when Charlie Rucker got into trouble over some mortgage  business; so I used what I had that time to help him. Now I've given  up the old ladies' home idea and am saving up for the blue silk dress  Dave would have liked me to have. I guess I'll die some day and I want  it to be buried in. I like to think I'm going to my two Daves then;  and it won't be hard,--especially if I have the blue silk on.\"    Just then a sleepy little bird twittered outside, and the baby stirred  a little. The first faint light of dawn was just creeping up the  valley. I rose and said I must get back to camp. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  and I had both wept with Mrs. Mortimer over little Dave. We have all  given up our first-born little man-child; so we felt near each other.  We told Mrs. Mortimer that we had passed under the rod also. I kissed  her toilworn old hands, and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy dropped a kiss on her  old gray head as we passed out into the rose-and-gold morning. We felt  that we were leaving a sanctified presence, and we are both of us  better and humbler women because we met a woman who has buried her  sorrow beneath faith and endeavor.    This doesn't seem much like a letter, does it? When I started on this  trip, I resolved that you should have just as much of the trip as I  could give you. I didn't know we would be so long getting to the  hunting-ground, and I felt you would _like_ to know of the people we  meet. Perhaps my next letter will not be so tame. The hunting season  opens to-morrow, but we are several days' travel from the elk yet.    Elizabeth behaves queerly. She doesn't want to go on, stay here, or go  back. I am perfectly mystified. So far she has not told us a thing,  and we don't know to whom she is going or anything about it. She is a  likable little lady, and I sincerely hope she knows what she is  doing. It is bedtime and I must stop writing. We go on to-morrow.                             With affectionate regards,                                ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          V    DANYUL AND HIS MOTHER                                    IN CAMP ON THE GROS VENTRE,                                     September 6, 1914.    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    I have neglected you for almost a week, but when you read this letter  and learn why, I feel sure you will forgive me.    To begin with, we bade Mrs. Mortimer good-bye, and started out to find  better fishing than the pretty little stream we were on afforded us.  Our way lay up Green River and we were getting nearer our final  camp-ground all the time, but we were in no hurry to begin hunting, so  we were just loitering along. There were a great many little lakes  along the valley, and thousands of duck. Mr. Stewart was driving, but  as he wanted to shoot ducks, I took the lines and drove along. There  is so much that is beautiful, and I was trying so hard to see it all,  that I took the wrong road; but none of us noticed it at first, and  then we didn't think it worth while to turn back.    The road we were on had lain along the foothills, but when I first  thought I had missed the right road we were coming down into a grassy  valley. Mr. Stewart came across a marshy stretch of meadow and climbed  up on the wagon. The ground was more level, and on every side were  marshes and pools; the willows grew higher here so that we couldn't  see far ahead. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy was behind, and she called out,  \"Say, I believe we are off the road.\" Elizabeth said she had noticed a  road winding off on our right; so we agreed that I must have taken the  wrong one, but as we couldn't turn in the willows, we had to go on.  Soon we reached higher, drier ground and passed through a yellow grove  of quaking asp.    A man came along with an axe on his shoulder, and Mr. Stewart asked  him about the road. \"Yes,\" he said, \"you are off the main road, but  on a better. You'll cross the same stream you were going to camp on,  right at my ranch. It is just a little way across here and it's almost  sundown, so I will show you the way.\"    He strode along ahead. We drove through an avenue of great dark  pines and across a log bridge that spanned a noisy, brawling stream.  The man opened a set of bars and we drove into a big clean corral.  Comfortable sheds and stables lined one side, and big stacks of hay  were conveniently placed. He began to help unharness the teams, saying  that they might just as well run in his meadow, as he was through  haying; then the horses would be safe while we fished. He insisted  on our stopping in his cabin, which we found to be a comfortable  two-room affair with a veranda the whole length. The _biggest_ pines  overshadowed the house; just behind it was a garden, in which some  late vegetables were still growing. The air was rather frosty and some  worried hens were trying hard to cover some chirping half-feathered  chicks.    It was such a homey place that we felt welcome and perfectly  comfortable at once. The inside of the house will not be hard to  describe. It was clean as could be, but with a typical bachelor's  cleanliness: there was no dirt, but a great deal of disorder. Across  the head of the iron bed was hung a miscellany of socks, neckties, and  suspenders. A discouraging assortment of boots, shoes, and leggings  protruded from beneath the bed. Some calendars ornamented the wall,  and upon a table stood a smoky lamp and some tobacco and a smelly  pipe. On a rack over the door lay a rifle.    Pretty soon our host came bustling in and exclaimed, \"The kitchen is  more pleasant than this room and there's a fire there, too.\" Then,  catching sight of his lamp, he picked it up hurriedly and said, \"Jest  as shore as I leave anything undone, that shore somebody comes and  sees how slouchy I am. Come on into the kitchen where you can warm,  and I'll clean this lamp. One of the cows was sick this morning; I  hurried over things so as to doctor her, and I forgot the lamp. I  smoke and the lamp smokes to keep me company.\"    The kitchen would have delighted the heart of any one. Two great  windows, one in the east and one in the south, gave plenty of  sunlight. A shining new range and a fine assortment of vessels--which  were not all yet in their place--were in one corner. There was a slow  ticking clock up on a high shelf; near the door stood a homemade  wash-stand with a tin basin, and above it hung a long narrow mirror.  On the back of the door was a towel-rack. The floor was made of white  pine and was spotlessly clean. In the center of the room stood the  table, with a cover of red oilcloth. Some chairs were placed about the  table, but our host quickly hauled them out for us. He opened his  storeroom and told us to \"dish in dirty-face,\" and help ourselves to  anything we wanted, because we were to be his \"somebody come\" for that  night; then he hurried out to help with the teams again. He was so  friendly and so likeable that we didn't feel a bit backward about  \"dishin' in,\" and it was not long before we had a smoking supper on  the table.    While we were at supper he said, \"I wonder, now, if any of you women  can make aprons and bonnets. I don't mean them dinky little things  like they make now, but rale wearin' things like they used to make.\"    I was afraid of another advertisement romance and didn't reply, but  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy said, \"Indade we can, none better.\"    Then he answered, \"I want a blue chambray bonnet and a bunch of aprons  made for my mother. She is on the way here from Pennsylvania. I ain't  seen her for fifteen years. I left home longer 'n that ago, but I  remember everything,--just how everything looked,--and I'd like to  have things inside the house as nearly like home as I can, anyway.\"    I didn't know how long we could stop there, so I still made no  promises, but Mrs. O'Shaughnessy could easily answer every question  for a dozen women.    \"Have you the cloth?\" she asked.    Yes, he said; he had had it for a long time, but he had not had it  sewn because he had not been sure mother _could_ come.    \"What's your name?\" asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy.    He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Daniel Holt.\"    I wondered why he hesitated, but forgot all about it when Clyde said  we would stop there for a few days, if we wanted to help Mr. Holt.  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy's mind was already made up. Elizabeth said she  would be glad to help, and I was not long in deciding when Daniel  said, \"I'll take it as a rale friendly favor if you women could help,  because mother ain't had what could rightly be called a home since I  left home. She's crippled, too, and I want to do all I can. I know  she'd just like to have some aprons and a sunbonnet.\"    His eyes had such a pathetic, appealing look that I was ashamed, and  we"]]]
