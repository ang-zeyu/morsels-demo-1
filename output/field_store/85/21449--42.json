During my spare moments, I am a great amateur of the local       form of entertainment known as television. I am especially       fascinated by the native actress Ingeborg Swedenborg, who, in spite       of being a Terran, compares most favorably with our own Fizbian       footlight favorites._         _The other day, while I am in the kitchen engaged in preparing the       ragout celeste a la fizbe for which I am justly celebrated on nine       planets, I hear a stir outside in the dining room. I strain my       ears. I hear the cry, \"It is Ingeborg Swedenborg!\"_         _I cannot help myself. I rush to the doorway. There, behold, the       incomparable Ingeborg herself! She follows the headwaiter to a       choice table. She is even more ravishing in real life than on the       screen. On her, it does not matter that she has no feathers save on       the head--even skin looks good. Overcome by involuntary ardor, I       boo at her. Whereupon I am violently assailed by a powerfully built       native whom I have not previously noticed to be escorting her._         _I am rescued before he can do me any permanent damage, though, if       you wish the truth, it will be a long time before I can fly again.       However, I am given notice by the cold-hearted management. Now I am       without a job. And what is more, if on this planet one is not       permitted to express one's instinctive and natural admiration for a       beautiful woman, then all I have to say is that it is a lousy       planet and I wiggle my toes at it. How do I go about getting       deported?_         _Impatiently yours,_         _Rajois Sludd_    \"Oh, I suppose it serves him right,\" Tarb said quickly, before Stet  could comment, \"but don't you think it would be a good idea if the  _Times_ got up a Fizbian-Terrestrial handbook of its own? It's the only  solution that I can see. The regular one, I recognize now, is more than  inadequate, with all that spiritual gup--\" Miss Snow drew in her breath  sharply--\"and not much else. All these problems are bound to arise again  and again. Frankly speaking, Stet, your solutions only take care of the  individual cases; they don't establish a sound intercultural basis.\"    He grunted.    \"What's more,\" she went on eagerly, \"we could not only give copies to  every Fizbian planning to visit Earth, but also print copies in Terran  for Terrestrials who are interested in learning more about Fizbus and  the Fizbians. In fact, all Terrans who come in contact with us should  have the book. It would help both races to understand each other so much  better and--\"    \"Unnecessary!\" Stet snapped, so violently that she stopped with her  mouth open. \"The standard handbook is more than adequate. Whatever  limitations it may have are deliberate. Setting down in cold print all  that ... stuff you want to have included would make a point of things we  prefer not to stress. I wouldn't want to have the Terrestrials humor me  as if I were a fledgling or a foreigner.\"    He leaped out of his chair and paced up and down the office. One would  think he had forgotten he ever could fly.    \"But you are a foreigner, Stet,\" Tarb said gently. \"No matter what you  do or say, Terrestrials and Fizbians are--well, worlds apart.\"    \"Spiritually, I am much closer to the Terrestrials than--but you  wouldn't understand.\" He and Miss Snow nodded sympathetically at each  other. \"And you might be interested to know that I happen to be the  author of all that 'spiritual gup.' I wrote the handbook--as a service  to Fizbus, I might point out. I wasn't paid for it.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" Tarb said. \"Oh, _dear_! I really and truly am sorry, Stet.\"    He brushed her apologies aside. \"Answer that letter. Ignore the question  about deportation entirely.\" He ran a foot through his crest. \"Just tell  the fellow to see our personnel manager. We could use a chef in the  company dining room. Haven't tasted a decent celestial ragout--at a  price I could afford--since I left Fizbus.\"    \"Would you want me to print that reply in the column?\" she asked. \"'If  you lose your job because you're unfamiliar with Terrestrial customs,  come to the _Times_. We'll give you another job at a much lower  salary.'\"    \"Of course not! Send your answer directly to him. You don't think we put  any of those letters you've been answering in the column, do you? Or any  that come in at all, for that matter. I have to write all the letters  that are printed--and answer them myself.\"    \"I should have recognized the style,\" Tarb said. \"So this is the service  the _Times_ offers to its subscribers. Nothing that would be of help.  Nothing that could prevent other Fizbians from making the same mistake.  Nothing that could be controversial. Nothing that would help  Terrestrials to understand us. Nothing, in short, but a lot of  birdseed!\"    \"Impertinence!\" Miss Snow remarked. \"You shouldn't let her talk to you  like that, Mr. Zarnon.\"    \"Tarb!\" Stet roared, casting an impatient glance at Miss Snow. \"How dare  you talk to me in that way? And all this is none of your business,  anyway.\"    \"I'm a Fizbian,\" she stated, \"and it certainly is my business. I'm not  ashamed of having wings. I'm proud of them and sorry for people who  don't have them. And, by the stars, I'm going to fly. If skirts are  improper to wear for flying, then I can wear slacks. I saw them in a  Terrestrial fashion magazine and they're perfectly respectable.\"    \"Not for working hours,\" Miss Snow sniffed.    \"I have no intention of flying during working hours,\" Tarb snapped back.  \"Even you should be able to see that the ceiling's much too low.\"    Stet ran a foot through his crest again. \"I hate to say this, Tarb, but  I don't feel you're the right person for this job. You mean well, I'm  sure, but you're too--too inflexible.\"    \"You mean I have principles,\" she retorted, \"and you don't.\" Which  wasn't entirely true; he had principles--it was just that they were  unprincipled.    \"That will be enough, Tarb,\" he said sternly. \"You'd better go now while  I think this over. I'd hate to send you back to Fizbus, because  I'd--well, I'd miss you. On the other hand....\"    Tarb went back to her office and drafted a long interstel to a cousin on  Fizbus, explaining what she would like for a birthday present. \"And  send it special delivery,\" she concluded, \"because I am having an urgent  and early birthday.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Tarb Morfatch!\" Stet howled, a few months later. \"What on Earth are you  doing?\"    \"Dictating into my scripto,\" Tarb said cheerfully. \"Some of the boys  from the print shop helped fix it up for me. They were very nice about  it, too, considering that the superscriptos will probably throw them out  of work. You know, Stet, Terrestrials can be quite decent people.\"    \"Where did you get that scripto?\"    \"Cousin Mylfis sent it to me for my birthday. I must have complained  about wearing out my claws on a typewriter and he didn't understand that  scriptos won't work on Earth. Only they do.\" She beamed at her employer.  \"All it needed was a transformer. I guess you're just not mechanically  minded, Stet.\"    He clenched his feet. \"Tarb, Terrestrials aren't ready for our  technology. You've done a very unwise thing in having that scripto sent  to you. And I've done a very unwise thing in keeping you here against my  better judgment.\"    \"Maybe the Terrestrials aren't ready,\" she said, ignoring his last  remark, \"but I'm not going to wear my feet to the bone if I can get a  gadget that'll do the same thing with no expenditure of physical  energy.\" She placed a foot on his. \"I don't see how a thing like this  could possibly corrupt the Terrestrials, Stet. It's made a better,  brighter girl out of me already.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" said Drosmig hoarsely from his perch.    \"Shut up, Senbot. You just don't understand, Tarb. If you'll only--\"    \"But I'm afraid I do understand, Stet. And I won't send my scripto  back.\"    \"May I come in?\" Miss Snow tapped lightly on the door frame. \"Is what I  hear true?\"    \"About the scripto?\" Tarb asked. \"It certainly is. All you have to do is  talk into it and the words appear on the paper. Guess that makes you  obsolete, doesn't it, Miss Snow?\"    \"And high time, too,\" commented Drosmig. \"Never liked the old biddy.\"    \"Senbot....\" Stet began, and stopped. \"Oh, what's the use trying to talk  reasonably to either of you! Tarb, come back to my office with me.\"    She could not refuse and so she followed. Miss Snow, torn between  curiosity and the scripto, hesitated and then made after them.    \"I've decided to take you off the column--for this morning, anyway--and  send you on an outside assignment,\" Stet told Tarb. \"The consul's wife  is coming to Earth today. Once she heard there was another woman on  Terra, nothing could stop her. Consul seems to think it's my fault,  too,\" he added moodily. \"Won't believe I had nothing to do with hiring  you. I told the Home Office not to send a woman, that she'd disrupt the  office, and you sure as hell have.\"    \"But I thought you said in your letters that you were doing everything  in your power to bring Fizbian womenfolk to their men on Terra!\" Tarb  pointed out malevolently.    \"Yes,\" he confessed. \"We must please our readers. You know that. Anyway,  all that's irrelevant right now. What I want you to do is go meet the  consul's wife. Nice touch, having the only other Fizbian woman here be  the one to interview her.

Shouldn't be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#6)"],[1," So said Abbe  Bartolocci, one of the first and most eminent bibliographers of  rabbinical literature, explaining that the short appellation had  the same force as when Saint Paul is designated simply as \"the  apostle.\"    The usual name applied to Rashi (R Sh I) is formed, in accordance  with a well-known Jewish custom, from the initials of his name  and patronymic in Hebrew, Rabbi Shelomo Izhaki[9], which the  Christians translated by Solomon Isaacides, just as they made  Maimonides of Moses ben Maimon.  Raymond Martini, the celebrated  author of the <I>Pugio fidei,</I> seems to have been the first  who saw in Rashi the initials of the words, R. Solomon Yarhi.  He confused Rashi either with a Solomon of Lunel, mentioned by  the traveller [traveler sic] Benjamin of Tudela, or with a  grammarian, Solomon ben Abba Mari, of Lunel, who lived in the  second half of the fourteenth century.  Sebastian Munster, the  German Hebraist (1489-1552), and the elder Buxtorf (1564-1629),  the humanist and highly esteemed Hebrew scholar, popularized the  mistake, which soon gave rise to another.  L'Empereur, also a  scholar in Hebraica, of the seventeenth century, went even  further than his predecessors, in holding Lunel [10] to have been  the birthplace of Rashi, while Basnage (1653-1725), the  celebrated historian of the Jews, spoke of \"Solomon the Lunatic.\"    Though as early a writer as Richard Simon (1638-1712) protested  against the error of making Lunel the native city of Rashi, the  mistake crept even into Jewish circles.  Since this city of  Languedoc was one of the principal centres [centers sic] of  Jewish learning in the Provence during the middle ages, Rashi, in  most unexpected fashion, came to swell the number of \"scholars\"  of Lunel, of whom mention is frequently made in rabbinical  literature.  It even seems that at the beginning of the  nineteenth century, Jews of Bordeaux went to Lunel on a  pilgrimage to his tomb.    In point of fact Rashi was neither a German nor a Provencal; he  was born and he died in Champagne, at Troyes.  At that time  France was divided into a dozen distinct countries, one of the  most important of which was the countship of Champagne, to the  northeast, between the Ile-de-France and Lorraine.  There were  Jews in all the important localities of the province, especially  in the commercial cities.  In the period with which we are  dealing, fairs took place every year successively at Lagny, Bar-  sur-Aube, Provins, Troyes, and again Provins and Troyes.  The  principal city was Troyes, which at the end of the ninth century,  when it contained about twelve thousand inhabitants, was chosen  as their capital by the counts of Champagne.    In a wide plain, where the Seine divides into several branches,  rises the city of Troyes, maintaining to some extent its medieval  character, with its narrow, illpaved streets, which of old  swarmed with geese and porkers, and with its houses of wooden  gables and overhanging roofs.  Manufactures prospered at Troyes.  Many tanneries were established there, and parchment was exported  from all parts of the district.  In fact it has been suggested  that the development of the parchment industry at Troyes  furthered the literary activity for which the province was noted,  by providing writing material at a time when in general it was so  rare.  But manufactures in that period had not attained a high  degree of perfection, and the main instrument for obtaining  wealth was commerce, chiefly the commerce carried on at fairs,  those great lists periodically opened to the commercial activity  of a whole province or a whole country.  Troyes, celebrated for  its fairs, was the scene of two a year, one beginning on St.  John's Day (the warm fair), and one beginning on St. Remy's Day  (the cold fair).  They covered a quarter so important that it  constituted two large parishes by itself.    Although religon [religion sic] had already begun to intervene in  the regulation of the fairs, Jews took a large part in them, and  somewhat later, like the Jews of Poland in the seventeenth  century, they used them as the occasions for rabbinical synods.  In the Jewish sources, the fairs of Troyes are frequently  mentioned.  The relations that sprang up among the great numbers  of Jews that went to them were favorable to the cause of science,  since the Jews in pursuing their material interests did not  forget those of learning.  Thus the fairs exercised a certain  influence upon the intellectual movement.    Troyes was also the seat of a permanent Jewish community of some  importance; for a Responsum of the first half of the eleventh  century declared that the regulations of the community should  have the force of law for each member, and when the regulations  deal with questions of general import they were to hold good for  neighboring communities as well.  Another Responsum dating from  the same period shows that the Jews of France owned land and  cultivated the vine.  Troyes no longer bears visible traces of  the ancient habitation of the Jews.  It is possible that the  parish of St. Frobert occupies the ground covered by the old  Jewry; and probably the church of St. Frobert, now in ruins, and  the church of St. Pantaleon were originally synagogues.  But in  Rashi's works there are more striking evidences that Jews were  identified with Troyes.  Certain of his expressions or other  indications attach them to the city of Troyes, \"our city,\" as he  says.    Rashi, then, was born at Troyes in 1040-the year of Gershom's  death, some authors affirm, who are more concerned with the  pragmatism of history than its truth, more with scientific  continuity than with the sequence of events.  But if it is almost  certain that the rabbi, who, as I said, was the precursor of  Rashi, had been dead for twelve years, 1040 (possibly 1038) is  probably the year of the death of another authority, no less  celebrated, Hai Gaon, whose passing away marks the irreparable  decadence of the Babylonian Gaonate.  The French rabbi and his  Spanish colleagues were destined to harvest the fruits of this  Gaonate and carry on its work, exemplifying the words of the  Talmud: \"When one star is extinguished in Israel, another star  rises on the horizon.\"    In order that Rashi should have a setting in accord with so high  a position, legend has surrounded his family with a nimbus of  glory.  History, it is true, does not make mention of his  ancestors, and this silence, joined to the popularity which Rashi  came to enjoy, inspired, or was an added stimulus to, the  fantastic genealogic theories of those who in their admiration of  him, or through pride of family, declared him to have been  descended from a rabbi of the third century, Johanan ha-  Sandlar.[11]  All that can be said with certainty is, that his  maternal uncle was Simon the Elder, a disciple of Gershom and a  learned and respected rabbi.  Rashi's father Isaac appears to  have been well-educated.  Rashi on one occasion mentions a  certain bit of instruction he had received from him.  Tradition,  fond of ascribing illustrious ancestors to its heroes, would see  in this Isaac one who through his knowledge and godliness  deserved to share in the renown of his son, and to whom his son,  moreover, rendered pious homage by quoting him in the opening  passage[12] of the commentary on Genesis.  We would willingly  believe Rashi capable of a delicate attention of this kind, only  we know that the Isaac cited is a certain Talmudic scholar.    Tradition, letting its fancy play upon the lives of great men,  delights also in clothing their birth with tales of marvels.  Sometimes the miraculous occurs even before they are born and  points to their future greatness.  The father of Rashi, for  instance, is said to have possessed a precious gem of great  value.  Some Christians wanted to take it away from him, either  because they desired to put it to a religious use, or because  they could not bear the sight of such a treasure in the hands of  a Jew.  Isaac obstinately refused their offers.  One day the  Christians lured him into a boat, and demanded that he give up  his gem.  Isaac, taking a heroic stand, threw the object of their  ardent desires into the water.  Then a mysterious voice was heard  in his school pronouncing these words: \"A son will be born to  thee, O Isaac, who will enlighten the eyes of all Israel.\"  According to a less familiar tradition, Isaac lived in a seaport  town, where he earned a poor livelihood as stevedore.  Once he  found a pearl in the harbor, and went in all haste to show it to  his wife, the daughter of a jeweler.  Realizing the value of the  pearl, she could not contain herself, and went forthwith to a  jeweler.  He offered her ten thousand ducats, double its value,  because the duke was anxious to buy it as an adornment for the  bishop's cope.  The woman would not listen to the proposition,  and ran back to her husband to tell him to what use the pearl was  going to be put.  Rather than have it adorn a bishop's vestment,  Isaac threw it into the sea, sacrificing his fortune to his God.    The scene of another tradition is laid at Worms.  One day his  wife, who had become pregnant, was walking along a street of the  city when two carriages coming from opposite directions collided.  The woman in danger of being crushed pressed up close against a  wall, and the wall miraculously sank inward to make way for her.  This made Isaac fear an accusation of witchcraft, and he left  Worms for Troyes, where a son was born to him, whom he named  Solomon.    To turn from the mythical to the hypothetical-the young Solomon  probably received his early education in his own family, and what  this education was, can easily be conceived.  It was the duty of  the father himself to take charge of the elementary instruction  of his son and turn the first glimmerings of the child's reason  upon the principles of religion.  This instruction was"]]]
