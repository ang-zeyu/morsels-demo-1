Ach nein! die Sehnsucht ist es nach dem Heil!    Würd' es durch solchen Engel mir zu Theil!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Like to a vision, seen in days long by gone,        This maiden's face and form appear:        What I have sought thro' countless years of sorrow        Am at I last beholding here!        Oft 'mid the torment of my night eternal,        Longing I gaz'd upon some being fair!        But I was driv'n by Satan's pow'r infernal        On my dread course, in anguish and despair!        The glow that warms my heart with strange emotion,        Can I, accurs'd one, call it love's devotion?        Ah! no, 'tis yearning blest repose to gain,        That such an angel might for me obtain!      SENTA.      Versank ich jetzt in wunderbares Träumen,    Was ich erblicke, ist es Wahn? --    Weilt' ich bisher in trügerischen Räumen,    Brach des Erwachens Tag heut an? --    Er steht vor mir mit leidenvollen Zügen,    Es spricht sein unerhörter Gram zu mir;    Kann tiefen Mitleids Stimme mich belügen?    Wie ich ihn oft geseh'n, so steht er hier.    Die Schmerzen, die in meinem Busen brennen,    Ach! dies Verlangen, wie soll ich es nennen?    Wonach mit Sehnsucht es ihn treibt -- das Heil.          SENTA.          And am I sunk in wondrous depths of dreaming?        Is this a vision which I see,        Or am I now set free from long delusion?        Has morning truly dawned on me?        See, there he stands, his face with sorrow clouding--        He tells me all his mingled hope and fear;        Is it the voice of sympathy that cheats me?        As he has oft in dreams, so stands he here!        The sorrow which within my breast is burning--        Ah, this compassion, what dare I call it?        Thy heart is longing after rest and peace,        And thou at last through me shall find release.      HOLLAENDER.      Wirst Du des Vaters Wahl nicht schelten?    Was er versprach, wie? dürft' es gelten? --    Du könntest Dich für ewig mir ergeben,    Und Deine Hand dem Fremdling reichtest Du?    Soll finden ich nach qualenvollem Leben    In Deiner Treu' die lang ersehnte Ruh? --          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Wilt thou, thy father's choice fulfilling,        Do what he said? Say, art thou willing?        Wilt thou, indeed, thyself forever give me?        Shall I in truth, a stranger, thus be blessed?        Say, shall I find the time of sorrow ended--        In thy true love my long-expected rest?      SENTA.      Wer Du auch seist, und welches das Verderben,    Dem grausam Dich Dein Schicksal konnte weih'n:    Was auch das Loos, das ich mir sollt' erwerben:    Gehorsam stets werd' ich dem Vater sein.          SENTA.          Whoe'er thou art, where'er thy curse may lead thee,        And me, when I thy lot mine own have made--        Whate'er the fate which I with thee may share in,        My father's will by me shall be obey'd.      HOLLAENDER.      So unbedingt, wie? könnte Dich durchdringen    Für meine Leiden tiefstes Mitgefühl?          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          So full of trust? what? canst thou in thy gladness,        For these my sorrows deep compassion know?      SENTA.      O, welche Leiden! Könnt' ich Trost Dir bringen!          SENTA.          Unheard-of sorrows! would I joy might bring thee!      HOLLAENDER.      Welch holder Klang im mächtigen Gewühl! --    Du bist ein Engel! -- Eines Engels Liebe    Verworf'ne selbst zu trösten weiss! --    Ach, wenn Erlösung mir zu hoffen bliebe,    Allewiger, durch diese sei's!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          How sweet the sound that breaks my night of woe!        Thou art an angel, and a love angelic        Can comfort bring to one like me.        Ah, if redemption still be mine to hope for,        Heaven, grant that she my savior be!      SENTA.      Ach! wenn Erlösung ihm zu hoffen bliebe,    Allewiger, durch mich nur sei's!          SENTA.          Ah, if redemption still be his to hope for,        Heaven, grant that I his saviour be!      HOLLAENDER.      O könntest das Geschick Du ahnen,    Dem dann mit mir Du angehörst:    Dich würd' es an das Opfer mahnen,    Das Du mir bringst, wenn Treu' Du schwörst.    Es flöhe schaudernd Deine Jugend,    Dem Loose, dem Du sie willst weih'n:    Nennst Du des Weibes schönste Tugend,    Nennst heil'ge Treue Du nicht Dein!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Ah, thou, the certain fate foreknowing,        Which must indeed with me be borne,        Wouldst not have made the vow thou madest--        Wouldst not to be my wife have sworn!        Thou wouldst have shuddered ere devoting,        To aid me, all thy golden youth--        Ere thou hadst woman's joys surrendered,        Ere thou hadst bid me trust thy truth?      SENTA.      Wohl kenn' ich Weibes hohe Pflichten, --    Sei d'rum getrost, unsel'ger Mann!    Lass über die das Schicksal richten,    Die seinem Spruche trotzen kann!    In meines Herzens höchster Reine    Kenn' ich der Treue Hochgebot:    Wem ich sie weih', schenk' ich die Eine;    Die Treue bis zum Tod!          SENTA.          Well know I woman's holy duties;        O hapless man, be thou at ease!        Leave me to fate's unbending judgment--        Me, who defy its dread decrees.        Within the secret realm of conscience        Know I the high demands of faith:        Him, whom I chose, him I love only,        And loving e'en till death!      HOLLAENDER.      Ein heil'ger Balsam meinen Wunden,    Dem Schwur, dem hohen Wort entfliesst!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          A healing balm for all my sorrows        From out her plighted word doth flow.      SENTA.      Von mächt'gem Zauber überwunden,    Reisst mich's zu seiner Rettung fort:          SENTA.          'Twas surely wrought by pow'r of magic        That I should his deliv'rer be.      HOLLAENDER.      Hört' es: mein Heil hab' ich gefunden,    Mächte, die ihr zurück mich stiess't!    Du Stern des Unheils, sollst erblassen!    Licht meiner Hoffnung, leuchte neu.    Ihr Engel, die mich einst verlassen,    Stärkt jetzt dies Herz in seiner Treu'!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Hear this! Release at last is granted!        Hear this, ye mighty:        Your power is now laid low!        Star of misfortune, thou art paling!        Hope's glorious light now shines anew!        Ye angels, ye who once forsook me,        Aid now my heart, and keep it true!      SENTA.      Hier habe Heimath er gefunden,    Hier ruh' sein Schiff im ew'gen Port!    Was ist's, das mächtig in mir lebet?    Was schliesst berauscht mein Busen ein?    Allmächt'ger, was mich hoch erhebet,    Lass es die Kraft der Treue sein!          SENTA.          Here may a home at last be granted,        Here may he rest, from danger free!        What is the power within me working?        What is the task it bids me do?        Almighty, now that high Thou hast raised me,        Grant me Thy strength, that I be true!      DALAND.      Verzeiht, mein Volk hält draussen sich mehr;    Nach jeder Rückkunft, wisset, giebt's ein Fest: --    Verschönern möcht' ich's, komme deshalb her,    Ob mit Verlobung sich's vereinen lässt? --    Ich denk', Ihr habt nach Herzenswunsch gefreit? --    Senta, mein Kind, sag', bist auch Du bereit? --          DALAND.          Pardon my intrusion; my men quite impatient will be,        On each arrival home we have a frolic,        And this time, I hope, it will be a marriage feast.        Say, Senta, child, art thou inclined to wed my friend?      SENTA.      Hier meine Hand, und ohne Reu'    Bis in den Tod gelob' ich Treu'!          SENTA.          Here my hand to the man of the sea:--        Unto death I will faithful be.      HOLLAENDER.      Sie reicht die Hand: gesprochen sei    Hohn Hölle dir, durch ihre Treu'!          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          Gladly she gives her fond heart to me,        And ended is now my misery.      DALAND.      Euch soll dies Bündniss nicht gereu'n!    Zum Fest! heut muss sich Alles freu'n!          DALAND.          May happiness forev'r be your part!        To the feast now with joyous heart!            DRITTER AKT.          ACT III.

I have mentioned the Reed-Bunting; let us take it as our first example  and try to follow its movements when the influence exerted by the  internal secretions begins to be reflected on the course of its  behaviour. First, it will be necessary to discover the exact localities  in any given district to which the species habitually returns for the  purpose of procreation; otherwise the earlier symptoms of any  disposition to secure a territory may quite possibly be overlooked in  the search for its breeding haunts.    In open weather Reed-Buntings pass the winter either singly, in twos or  threes, or in small flocks, on bare arable ground, upon seed fields, or  in the vicinity of water-courses; but in the breeding season they  resort to marshy ground where the _Juncus communis_ grows in abundance,  to the dense masses of the common reed (_Arundo phragmites_), and such  like places. During the winter, the male's routine of existence is of a  somewhat monotonous order, limited to the necessary search for food  during the few short hours of daylight and enforced inactivity during  the longer hours of darkness. But towards the middle of February a  distinct change manifests itself in the bird's behaviour. Observe what  then happens. When they leave the reed-bed in the morning, instead of  flying with their companions to the accustomed feeding grounds, the  males isolate themselves and scatter in different directions. The  purpose of their behaviour is not, however, to find fresh feeding  grounds, nor even to search for food as they have been wont to do, but  rather to discover stations suitable for the purpose of breeding; and,  having done so, each male behaves in a like manner--it selects some  willow, alder, or prominent reed, and, perching thereon, leads a quiet  life, singing or preening its feathers. Now if the movements of one  particular male are kept in view, it will be noticed that only part of  its time is spent in its territory. At intervals it disappears. I do not  mean that one merely loses sight of it, but that it actually deserts its  territory. As if seized with a sudden impulse it rises into the air and  flies away, often for a considerable distance and often in the same  direction, and is absent for a period which may vary in length from a  few minutes to an hour or even more. But these periodical desertions  become progressively less and less frequent in occurrence until the  whole of its life is spent in the few acres in which it has established  itself.    The behaviour of the Yellow Bunting is similar. In any roadside hedge  two or more males can generally be found within a short distance of one  another, and in such a place their movements can be closely and  conveniently followed. Under normal conditions the ordinary winter  routine continues until early in February; but the male then deserts the  flock, seeks a position of its own, and becomes isolated from its  companions. Now the position which it selects does not, as a rule,  embrace a very large area--a few acres perhaps at the most. But there is  always some one point which is singled out and resorted to with marked  frequency--a tree, a bush, a gate-post, a railing, anything in fact  which can form a convenient perch, and eventually it becomes a central  part of the bird's environment. Here it spends the greater part of its  time, here it utters its song persistently, and here it keeps watch upon  intruders. The process of establishment is nevertheless a gradual one.  The male does not appear in its few acres suddenly and remain there  permanently as does the migrant; at first it may not even roost in the  prospective territory. The course of procedure is somewhat as  follows:--At dawn it arrives and for a while utters its song, preens its  feathers, or searches for food; then it vanishes, rising into the air  and flying in one fixed direction as far as the eye can follow, until it  becomes a speck upon the horizon and is ultimately lost to view. During  these excursions it rejoins the small composite flocks which still  frequent the fields and farm buildings. For a time the hedgerow is  deserted and the bird remains with its companions. But one does not have  to wait long for the return; it reappears as suddenly as it vanished,  flying straight back to the few acres which constitute its territory,  back even to the same gate-post or railing, where it again sings. This  simple routine may be repeated quite a number of times during the first  two hours or so of daylight, with, of course, a certain amount of  variation; on one occasion the bird may be away for a few minutes only,  on another for perhaps half an hour, whilst sometimes it will fly for a  few hundred yards, hesitate, and then return--all of which shows clearly  enough that these few acres possess some peculiar significance and are  capable of exercising a powerful influence upon the course of its  behaviour. And so the disposition in relation to the territory becomes  dominant in the life of the bird.    Or take the case of the Chaffinch. In winter large or small flocks can  be found in many varied situations. But in the latter part of February,  or the early days of March, these flocks begin to disperse. At daylight  males can then be observed in all kinds of situations, either calling  loudly, uttering their spring note, or exercising their vocal powers to  the full; and it will be found that, in the majority of instances, these  males are solitary individuals, that they pass the early hours of the  morning alone, and that their normal routine of calling, singing, or  searching for food, is only interrupted by quarrels with their  neighbours. The same locality is visited regularly--not only the same  acre or so of ground, but even the same elm or oak, has, as its daily  occupant, the same cock Chaffinch. And temporary desertions from the  territory occur also, much like those referred to in the life of the  Bunting, but perhaps not so frequently. One has grown so accustomed  during the dark days of winter to the sociable side of Chaffinch  behaviour--to the large flocks searching for food, to the endless stream  of individuals returning in the evening to roost in the holly-trees, to  the absence of song--that this radical departure from the normal routine  comes as something of a surprise; for the days are still short, the  temperature is still low, the nesting season is still many weeks ahead,  and yet for part of the day, and for just that part when the promptings  of hunger must be strongest, the male, instead of joining the flock,  isolates itself and expends a good deal of energy in insuring that its  isolation shall be complete. And in place of the silence we hear from  all directions the cheerful song uttered with such marked persistency  that it almost seems as if the bird itself must be aware that by doing  so it was advertising the fact of its occupation of a territory. This is  surely a remarkable change, and the females in the meantime continue  their winter routine.    One other example. The monotonous call of the Greenfinch is probably  familiar to all. In winter these birds accompany other Finches and form  with them flocks of varying sizes, but in the spring the flocks  disperse, and the Greenfinch, in common with other units of the flock,  alters its mode of life. But whereas the Chaffinch or the Bunting begins  to acquire its territory in February, the Greenfinch only does so in  April. When the organic changes do at length begin to make themselves  felt, the male seeks a position of its own, and having found one remains  there, uttering its characteristic call. But owing probably to the fact  that it is much later than the aforementioned species in acquiring a  territory, temporary desertions are not so much in evidence. The species  is so very plentiful, and the bird is so prone to nest in gardens and  shrubberies surrounding human habitations, that this seasonal change in  its routine of existence cannot fail to be noticed. One can hear its  call in every direction, one can watch the same individual in the same  tree; and it is the male that is thus seen and heard, the female appears  later. Thus the behaviour falls into line with that of the Bunting or  the Chaffinch.    The behaviour of these resident species throws some light upon the early  arrival of the males which we are endeavouring to explain in the case of  the migrants. Let us see how their actions compare. The male resident  deserts the female early in the year and establishes itself in a  definite position, where it advertises its presence by song; the male  migrant travels from a great distance, arrives later, and also  establishes itself in a definite position, where it, too, advertises its  presence by song. The male resident passes only the earlier part of the  day in its territory at the commencement of the period of occupation;  the male migrant remains there continuously from the moment it arrives.  The male resident deserts its territory at intervals, even in the  morning; the male migrant betrays no inclination to do so. Thus there is  a very close correspondence between the behaviour of the two, and what  difference there is--slight after all--cannot be said to affect the main  biological end of securing territory. One is apt to think of the problem  of migration in terms of the species instead of in terms of the  individual. One pictures a vast army"]]]
