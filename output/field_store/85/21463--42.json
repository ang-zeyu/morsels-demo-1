Taylor collector].    _Diagnosis._--Size medium (Male to 38 mm., Female to 40 mm.); skull  wider than long; nasals truncate anteriorly; frontoparietal fontanelle  moderate in size; snout slightly protruding; tympanum about size of  largest discs on fingers; dorsum marked by longitudinal stripes; dark  stripe between eye and nostril; in life tan to olive-green with or  without dark mark between eyes; bones greenish blue.    _Description._--Head flat, longer than wide; snout long, rounded,  protruding beyond mouth; canthus indistinct; length of eye equal to  interorbital distance; loreal region not pronounced; tympanum distinct  and about two-fifths diameter of eye; interorbital triangle present or  absent; arms short; trace of web between fingers, extending as fringe  along sides of fingers; first finger very short with small disc; other  discs about size of those on toes; discs on third finger and fourth  toe as large as tympanum; outer palmar tubercle moderate in size,  partly bifid; inner palmar tubercle large, elongate, flat;  subarticular tubercles distinct; legs moderately long; tarsal fold  absent; inner metatarsal tubercle flat; outer metatarsal tubercle  smaller, indistinct; subarticular tubercles moderate in size; fringe  on toes to tip of disc of second toe; rest of toes about two-thirds  webbed; foot length about two fifths snout-vent length; tibia length  about one half snout-vent length; skin above smooth or with minute  pustules; belly finely granular; ventral surfaces of thighs and areas  below anus granular; skin on ventral surfaces of limbs smooth; tongue  relatively large, longer than wide, barely notched behind; vocal slits  elongate, lateral to tongue; choanae medium in size. In life, dorsum  yellowish brown, olive green, or grayish brown with dark brown spots  on snout, dark brown stripe from nostril to eye, dark yellow-brown  interorbital triangle, and dark supratympanic region; generally five  interrupted longitudinal dark brown stripes on dorsum (one on each  flank, pair of paravertebral and one vertebral); flanks pale yellow;  groin yellowish brown; thighs marked with one or two transverse  yellow-brown blotches; shanks with two or three yellow-brown blotches  above; spaces between blotches on thighs, shanks, tarsi, and feet  yellow; brown spots on tarsi and in some specimens on feet; arm pale  yellow with pale brown spots; belly creamy white having slight  blue-green tint; vocal sac and chin yellow; axillary region yellow,  blue-green in some specimens (Pl. 2A).    In preservative, head and dorsum yellowish brown; dark brown stripe  from nostril to eye; dark brown spots on snout; a dark brown  interorbital triangle with apex directed backward; dark brown  supratympanic region; dorsal stripes same as in living individuals;  flanks pale yellow with brown spots in some specimens; groin creamy  white; thighs and shanks having or lacking transverse dark brown  blotches; spaces between blotches creamy white or yellow-brown; arms  pale yellowish brown; belly and vocal sac creamy white.    _Variation._--Geographic variation in size and some proportions, such  as the ratio of tibia length to snout-vent length and the ratio of the  diameter of the tympanum to that of the eye, have been observed in  this species. The largest individuals are from the Golfo Dulce region  (samples from Piedras Blancas and Rincon de Osa), Puntarenas Province,  Costa Rica. The smallest individuals are from El Recreo, Zelaya  Province, Nicaragua, and from the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica.    The diameter of the tympanum is proportionately larger (relative to  the size of the eye) in males from Tilaran, Guanacaste Province; the  tympanum is nearly as large in males from Piedras Blancas, Puntarenas  Province, and Puerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica. The lowest  ratios occur in individuals from Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama, in  specimens from the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica (except Puerto  Viejo), and in those from El Recreo, Zelaya Province, Nicaragua. In  general, the tympanum is proportionately larger in females than in  males; the tympanum is largest in females from the Pacific lowlands  of Costa Rica (Table 5).    Color variation has been observed in individuals from the same  population, as well as in individuals from different localities,  between males and females, and from night to day. In life, most  individuals from the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica are dark tan to  greenish gray above with dark brown longitudinal stripes that are  entire or broken, but some specimens (mostly males) are dusky brown  and lack longitudinal stripes or an interorbital triangle; females  usually have the dark interorbital triangle and the stripes on the  dorsum. Individuals from Turrialba, Cartago Province, Costa Rica, are  pale olive-tan with olive-brown markings. Individuals from Puerto  Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, are uniformly yellowish brown  with or without dark longitudinal stripes. Specimens from El Recreo,  Zelaya Province, Nicaragua, are like those from Puerto Viejo. Males  from Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama, are pale brown with dark brown  longitudinal stripes and an indistinct interorbital triangle. Females  have a distinct interorbital triangle and dark brown blotches on the  thighs and shanks.    By night, the dorsum usually is pale yellow, and the belly is creamy  white. By day, the dorsum is dark tan; the stripes and spots are  darker, and the belly is yellowish white. Taylor (1952) noticed that  considerable variation in color pattern occurred from night to day in  individuals from Turrialba, Cartago Province, Costa Rica. At night  some individuals lacked a dorsal pattern, but by day many of these  individuals developed dorsal stripes.    _Cranial Osteology._--The skull of _Hyla elaeochroa_ is slightly wider  than it is long, and flat. The premaxillary is small and bears 10 to  15 teeth (mean for 9 specimens, 12.3). The alary process of the  premaxillary is small, vertical, and slightly concave posteriorly.  Ventrally, the premaxillary is partially united to the prevomer by  ossification. The maxillary is slender and bears 70 to 82 teeth (mean  for 9 specimens, 74.3). The pars facialis of the maxillary is  laterally convex and is about twice as high as the pars dentalis.    The nasal is large, robust, anteriorly truncate, but pointed  posteriorly in dorsal view. The nasal comprises about 45 per cent of  the total length of the skull. There is an anterior cartilaginous  septum nasi separating the two nasals; the latter overlap the  sphenethmoid posteriorly. Each nasal bears a shallow concavity in the  midlateral side and lacks a maxillary process. Dorsally, the  sphenethmoid is wider than long, roughly pentagonal in shape; the  frontoparietal is elongate, smooth, and bears a small anterior  supraorbital process. The sphenethmoid and frontoparietal form the  anterior margin of the frontoparietal fontanelle; the fontanelle is  narrow anteriorly and wider posteriorly (Fig. 5B).    The entire distal surface of the prooetic is in contact with the  posterior arm of the squamosal. A narrow cartilaginous crista parotica  is visible dorsally in some specimens. The squamosal is broad  posteriorly but its anterior arm is slender and not in contact with  the maxillary.    TABLE 5.--Geographic Variation in Size and Proportions in Males of  _Hyla elaeochroa_.

(#6)"],[1,"eign, then, to smile upon my suit,      Nor heedlessly my vows refuse;    But trust the honour of the brute      Who seeks to win thee with his muse!      The education I had received, and the advantages I possessed in the  way of books, joined to my present loneliness, induced me to carry out  an idea that had more than once entered my head, and which my kind  relation, when alive, had strongly encouraged. This was to get together  the Kittens of some of my friends who were anxious to obtain knowledge,  and impart to them some portion of that I had myself acquired,--in  brief, to keep a school.    I never ceased to remember the words of my poor cousin when speaking on  this subject. \"My dear,\" she had often said, \"it is the duty of every  Cat in this world to make herself useful; she is sent here for that  purpose, depend upon it; and although all Cats cannot be useful in the  same way or to the same extent, some being placed in very different  circumstances to others, _every_ Cat, rich or poor, _may_ do a certain  amount of useful work, which if she neglects, she is wicked. No  employment is so honourable as that of teaching to others the learning  we have ourselves attained; for learning destroys prejudice, makes us  better as well as wiser, and helps us to bear with greater fortitude  the calamities of life. As you have yourself acquired learning, you may  therefore show your usefulness by imparting it to others; and depend  upon it, no consolation will be greater to you in hours of misfortune,  and even on your bed of death, than the thought that you have not spent  your life in vain!\"    It was with such sanction that I entered on my new career. Each day  might I have been seen, perched upon a high-backed chair, with book  in hand, examining my class as it stood up before me; a rod within my  reach to frighten evil-doers, the inattentive, and the careless; and  sometimes, with a dunce of a Kitten before me standing upon a form, with  an ugly cap upon her head, on account of some terrible breach of good  manners, or an extra amount of stupidity in conning her tasks.          LOVE AND WAR.      Hum Villa, the house which had been left me by my deceased cousin, stood  a little back from the main street, and although surrounded with smaller  dwellings, was yet quiet and retired.    This was owing to its garden, and to several fine trees which shaded it;  one of them particularly, an ancient oak, that stood by the right-hand  corner of the grounds, cast its broad and knotted arms over a rustic  bench, and made a delightful retreat from the warmth of the summer sun.    It had been the favourite spot of my departed relation: here she would  come, in the long afternoons, and, reclining on the chair, with a book  in her hand, read a page or two, then stop to listen to the birds which  twittered in the topmost branches of the tree, or watch the busy insects  at her feet, as they ran about intent upon their pursuits of business or  enjoyment.    There could not have been a stronger proof of the goodness of her  disposition, than to note the friendship which existed between her and  the timid birds that frequented the garden. Perhaps it was the love of  music in both that created a kind of sympathy between them, for I have  often hidden myself within a short distance of her seat, in order to  watch the proceedings of herself and feathered friends.    When they observed her alone, they would hop down from branch to branch,  until they were almost within her reach, when, after hesitating a few  moments to see that no other Puss was near, they would leap down upon  her seat, upon the ground, upon her very shoulder, and begin their  songs. Then followed such a twittering and chattering, while their wings  trembled with excitement, until, at some noise perhaps which I myself  had made, they would start from their places, and in an instant fly up,  up, until they had put the whole height of the tree between them and the  supposed danger. Often had I wished to obtain from them a similar  confidence; often by various inducements of food and voice endeavoured  to lure them down. My persuasions were all useless: they would put their  little heads on one side, and talk a little among themselves, apparently  debating whether it would be advisable to accept my invitation; but some  old and cautious birds, I suppose, advised them to refuse my advances,  for they never dared to partake of the meal I had spread for them until  I had myself taken my departure.    Once only, after my cousin's death, when I was seated in the place, and  in the attitude she herself was accustomed to assume, did a venturesome  little creature undertake to pay me a closer visit. But I was not  flattered by the attention, for it evidently mistook me for her who was  no more; as, scarcely had it perched upon the arm of the bench, at the  opposite end to where I was sitting, and glanced at my face, than it  flew off in the greatest alarm to communicate its terrors to its  companions.    Although I thus failed to secure the confidence and friendship of my  cousin's allies, there were other sources of amusement which this quiet  nook afforded me. Unseen myself, I had a view of at least a dozen  dwellings, and of the antics played by their inhabitants. It is  astonishing to a Cat of perfect good-breeding to observe the propensity  of the uneducated classes to climbing and creeping about in the most  elevated and dangerous positions. Within a few doors of my own house  resided an old Tom, whose business I never could guess, but who was at  home all day sleeping or smoking, and went out to his occupation at  nightfall. Instead however of taking his rest within-doors, as one would  have thought it most comfortable to do, he always had his doze in the  open air, and no place would suit him but the very edge of the roof of  his house, with his legs and tail generally swinging in the air. It was  a wonder to me that he did not either fall or get pitched off; for his  sons and daughters, an immense tribe of unruly Cats of all ages, were  constantly on the roof too, chasing each other about, rolling over one  another's backs, and often hissing and spitting at each other in a most  shocking and boisterous way. Their poor mother had lost all control over  them, and after trying, as I had often seen her, to get them into more  orderly habits, she was forced to give up the struggle and allow them to  take their own course.    These rude creatures had taken a particular dislike to me: first,  because I had reproved the young Pussies for their behaviour, as being  very unbecoming their age and sex; and secondly, on account of my having  forbidden them entering my grounds to chase the poor birds who lodged in  the trees.    As to the latter particular, they at first set my wishes at defiance,  paid no attention to my remonstrances, and actually one day came over  the palings into my garden and carried off a poor little bird which  had fallen from its nest. I was then obliged to have recourse to other  measures. I hired an old Tom to scare them away, which he did so  effectually that they never ventured to come within his reach. But their  hatred to me became all the greater; and as from their lofty position on  the housetop they could see right into my garden, whenever I ventured to  walk there, they saluted me with all sorts of names, called me a \"Prude,\"  the \"Schoolmistress,\" and anything else which they thought would annoy  me, so that I was pleased to have the shelter of my arbour, where I  could be out of sight and yet enjoy the fresh air.    It is always unpleasant to be at variance with one's neighbours, and  no doubt animals ought to make many sacrifices to prevent it, and live  in harmony together; but it would have been weakness to give up the  happiness and even the lives of my favourite birds--the favourites too  of my poor dead Cousin--in order to please the unruly offspring of my  singular neighbour. A state of war might therefore be said to exist  between us, and I was not long in feeling the effect of the malice I had  unwillingly provoked.    And here I must speak of an adventure which, although quite innocent in  itself, caused me a great deal of pain, and forced me to become, for a  long time, a wanderer from my native city.    One evening, when seated in my arbour, after my pupils were dismissed,  a servant came to inform me that a strange Tom was in the parlour,  who desired to speak to me. I at once went in, and observed a tall,  foreign-looking figure, who introduced himself as Senhor Dickie. He  explained that he was an artist; had met my cousin in his own country;  had been invited by her to pay her a visit at her house in Caneville,  if ever he should come that way; that he had arrived that morning, and  learnt to his surprise that she was no more; that he had nevertheless  taken the liberty to come to the house, in order to see the surviving  relative of one for whom he entertained a warm friendship, and express  his sorrow for her death.    He said all this in so Cat-like a tone, and his beautiful green eyes had  so tender an expression when he spoke of my poor cousin and looked at  me, that I quite felt for him, and we had a long chat together about the  goodness of her who was no more. We had talked ourselves into so good  an understanding, that, when he went away, I asked him, as a matter of  course, to come and see me again; nor could I indeed avoid inviting him  to that house to which, had my cousin been alive, he would have been,  no doubt, very welcome.    Senhor Dickie came often to see me, and every time he came the better  did we become acquainted. We chatted together about all sorts of things;  we sang duets together (he had a fine bass voice); and at last he  requested permission to take my portrait, which he did, as represented  in the Frontispiece to this Autobiography.    It was on occasion of one of these visits that, on a hot"]]]
