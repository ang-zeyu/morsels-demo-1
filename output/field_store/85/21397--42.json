The Mason, when she flies  away, rushes into the tube, which enables me, without touching her, to  transfer her at once into a screw of paper. This I quickly close. A tin  box, an ordinary botanizing-case, serves to convey the prisoners, each  in her separate paper bag.    The most delicate business, that of marking each captive before  setting her free, is left to be done on the spot selected for the  starting-point. I use finely-powdered chalk, steeped in a strong  solution of gum arabic. The mixture, applied to some part of the insect  with a straw, leaves a white patch, which soon dries and adheres to  the fleece. When a particular Mason-bee has to be marked so as to  distinguish her from another in short experiments, such as I shall  describe presently, I confine myself to touching the tip of the abdomen  with my straw while the insect is half in the cell, head downwards. The  slight touch is not noticed by the Bee, who continues her work quite  undisturbed; but the mark is not very deep and moreover it is in a  rather bad place for any prolonged experiment, for the Bee is constantly  brushing her belly to detach the pollen and is sure to rub it off sooner  or later. I therefore make another one, dropping the sticky chalk right  in the middle of the thorax, between the wings.    It is hardly possible to wear gloves at this work: the fingers need all  their deftness to take up the restless Bee delicately and to overpower  her without rough pressure. It is easily seen that, though the job may  yield no other profit, you are at least sure of being stung. The sting  can be avoided with a little dexterity, but not always. You have to put  up with it. In any case, the Mason-bee's sting is far less painful than  that of the Hive-bee. The white spot is dropped on the thorax; the Mason  flies off; and the mark dries on the journey.    I start with two Mason-bees of the Walls working at their nests on the  pebbles in the alluvia of the Aygues, not far from Serignan. I carry  them home with me to Orange, where I release them after marking them.  According to the ordnance-survey map, the distance is about two and a  half miles as the crow flies. The captives are set at liberty in the  evening, at a time when the Bees begin to leave off work for the day.  It is therefore probable that my two Bees will spend their night in the  neighbourhood.    Next morning, I go to the nests. The weather is still too cool and the  works are suspended. When the dew has gone, the Masons begin work. I see  one, but without a white spot, bringing pollen to one of the nests  which had been occupied by the travellers whom I am expecting. She is  a stranger who, finding the cell whose owner I myself had exiled  untenanted, has installed herself there and made it her property, not  knowing that it is already the property of another. She has perhaps been  victualling it since yesterday evening. Close upon ten o'clock, when  the heat is at its full, the mistress of the house suddenly arrives: her  title-deeds as the original occupant are inscribed for me in undeniable  characters on her thorax white with chalk. Here is one of my travellers  back.    Over waving corn, over fields all pink with sainfoin, she has covered  the two miles and a half; and here she is, back at the nest, after  foraging on the way, for the doughty creature arrives with her abdomen  yellow with pollen. To come home again from the verge of the horizon  is wonderful in itself; to come home with a well-filled pollen-brush is  superlative economy. A journey, even a forced journey, always becomes a  foraging-expedition.    She finds the stranger in the nest:    'What's this? I'll teach you!'    And the owner falls furiously upon the intruder, who possibly was  meaning no harm. A hot chase in mid-air now takes place between the two  Masons. From time to time, they hover almost without movement, face to  face, with only a couple of inches separating them, and here, doubtless  measuring forces with their eyes, they buzz insults at each other. Then  they go back and alight on the nest in dispute, first one, then the  other. I expect to see them come to blows, to make them draw their  stings. But my hopes are disappointed: the duties of maternity speak  in too imperious a voice for them to risk their lives and wipe out  the insult in a mortal duel. The whole thing is confined to hostile  demonstrations and a few insignificant cuffs.    Nevertheless, the real proprietress seems to derive double courage and  double strength from the feeling that she is in her rights. She takes up  a permanent position on the nest and receives the other, each time  that she ventures to approach, with an angry quiver of her wings, an  unmistakable sign of her righteous indignation. The stranger, at last  discouraged, retires from the field. Forthwith the Mason resumes her  work, as actively as though she had not just undergone the hardships of  a long journey.    One more word on these quarrels about property. It is not unusual,  when one Mason-bee is away on an expedition, for another, some homeless  vagabond, to call at the nest, take a fancy to it and set to work on it,  sometimes at the same cell, sometimes at the next, if there are  several vacant, which is generally the case in the old nests. The first  occupier, on her return, never fails to drive away the intruder, who  always ends by being turned out, so keen and invincible is the mistress'  sense of ownership. Reversing the savage Prussian maxim, 'Might is  right,' among the Mason-bees right is might, for there is no other  explanation of the invariable retreat of the usurper, whose strength is  not a whit inferior to that of the real owner. If she is less bold, this  is because she has not the tremendous moral support of knowing herself  in the right, which makes itself respected, among equals, even in the  brute creation.    The second of my travellers does not reappear, either on the day when  the first arrived or on the following days. I decide upon another  experiment, on this occasion with five subjects. The starting-place is  the same; and the place of arrival, the distance, the time of day, all  remain unchanged. Of the five with whom I experiment, I find three at  their nests next day; the two others are missing.    It is therefore fully established that the Mason-bee of the Walls,  carried to a distance of two and a half miles and released at a place  which she has certainly never seen before, is able to return to the  nest. But why do first one out of two and then two out of five fail  to join their fellows? What one can do cannot another do? Is there a  difference in the faculty that guides them over unknown ground? Or is it  not rather a difference in flying-power? I remember that my Bees did not  all start off with the same vigour. Some were hardly out of my fingers  before they darted furiously into the air, where I at once lost sight  of them, whereas the others came dropping down a few yards away from me,  after a short flight. The latter, it seems certain, must have suffered  on the journey, perhaps from the heat concentrated in the furnace of my  box. Or I may have hurt the articulation of the wings in marking them,  an operation difficult to perform when you are guarding against  stings. These are maimed, feeble creatures, who will linger in the  sainfoin-fields close by, and not the powerful aviators required by the  journey.    The experiment must be tried again, taking count only of the Bees  who start off straight from between my fingers with a clean, vigorous  flight. The waverers, the laggards who stop almost at once on some  bush shall be left out of the reckoning. Moreover, I will do my best to  estimate the time taken in returning to the nest. For an experiment of  this kind, I need plenty of subjects, as the weak and the maimed, of  whom there may be many, are to be disregarded. The Mason-bee of the  Walls is unable to supply me with the requisite number: there are not  enough of her; and I am anxious not to interfere too much with the  little Aygues-side colony, for whom I have other experiments in view.  Fortunately, I have at my own place, under the eaves of a shed, a  magnificent nest of Chalicodoma sicula in full activity. I can draw to  whatever extent I please on the populous city. The insect is small, less  than half the size of C. muraria, but no matter: it will deserve all the  more credit if it can traverse the two miles and a half in store for it  and find its way back to the nest. I take forty Bees, isolating them, as  usual, in screws of paper.    In order to reach the nest, I place a ladder against the wall: it will  be used by my daughter Aglae and will enable her to mark the exact  moment of the return of the first Bee. I set the clock on the  mantelpiece and my watch at the same time, so that we may compare the  instant of departure and of arrival. Things being thus arranged, I carry  off my forty captives and go to the identical spot where C. muraria  works, in the pebbly bed of the Aygues. The trip will have a double  object: to observe Reaumur's Mason and to set the Sicilian Mason at  liberty. The latter, therefore, will also have two and a half miles to  travel home.    At last my prisoners are released, all of them being first marked with a  big white dot in the middle of the thorax.    You do not come off scot-free when handling one after the other forty  wrathful Bees, who promptly unsheathe and brandish their poisoned  stings. The stab is but too often given before the mark is made. My  smarting fingers make movements of self-defence which my will is not  always able to control. I take hold with greater precaution for myself  than for the insect; I sometimes squeeze harder than I ought to if I am  to spare my travellers. To experiment so as to lift, if possible, a  tiny corner of the veil of truth is a fine and noble thing, a mighty  stimulant in the face of danger;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2885"],[0,"The House of the Wolfings (#6)"],[1,"the wains of the Markmen, they were stoutly framed of ash-tree  with panels of aspen, and they were broad-wheeled so that they might go  over rough and smooth.  They had high tilts over them well framed of  willow-poles covered over with squares of black felt over-lapping like  shingles; which felt they made of the rough of their fleeces, for they  had many sheep.  And these wains were to them for houses upon the way if  need were, and therein as now were stored their meal and their war-store  and after fight they would flit their wounded men in them, such as were  too sorely hurt to back a horse: nor must it be hidden that whiles they  looked to bring back with them the treasure of the south.  Moreover the  folk if they were worsted in any battle, instead of fleeing without more  done, would often draw back fighting into a garth made by these wains,  and guarded by some of their thralls; and there would abide the onset of  those who had thrust them back in the field.  And this garth they called  the Wain-burg.    So now stood three of these wains aforesaid belated amidst of the  habitations of the House, their yoke-beasts standing or lying down  unharnessed as yet to them: but in the very midst of that place was a  wain unlike to them; smaller than they but higher; square of shape as to  the floor of it; built lighter than they, yet far stronger; as the  warrior is stronger than the big carle and trencher-licker that loiters  about the hall; and from the midst of this wain arose a mast made of a  tall straight fir-tree, and thereon hung the banner of the Wolfings,  wherein was wrought the image of the Wolf, but red of hue as a token of  war, and with his mouth open and gaping upon the foemen.  Also whereas  the other wains were drawn by mere oxen, and those of divers colours, as  chance would have it, the wain of the banner was drawn by ten black bulls  of the mightiest of the herd, deep-dewlapped, high-crested and  curly-browed; and their harness was decked with gold, and so was the wain  itself, and the woodwork of it painted red with vermilion.  There then  stood the Banner of the House of the Wolfings awaiting the departure of  the warriors to the hosting.    So Thiodolf stood on the top of the bent beside that same mound wherefrom  he had blown the War-horn yester-eve, and which was called the Hill of  Speech, and he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked around him; and  even therewith the carles fell to yoking the beasts to the belated wains,  and the warriors gathered together from out of the mixed throngs, and  came from the Roof and the Man's-door and all set their faces toward the  Hill of Speech.    So Thiodolf knew that all was ready for departure, and it wanted but an  hour of high-noon; so he turned about and went into the Hall, and there  found his shield and his spear hanging in his sleeping place beside the  hauberk he was wont to wear; then he looked, as one striving with  thought, at his empty hauberk and his own body covered with the dwarf-  wrought rings; nor did his face change as he took his shield and his  spear and turned away.  Then he went to the dais and there sat his foster-  daughter (as men deemed her) sitting amidst of it as yester-eve, and now  arrayed in a garment of fine white wool, on the breast whereof were  wrought in gold two beasts ramping up against a fire-altar whereon a  flame flickered; and on the skirts and the hems were other devices, of  wolves chasing deer, and men shooting with the bow; and that garment was  an ancient treasure; but she had a broad girdle of gold and gems about  her middle, and on her arms and neck she wore great gold rings wrought  delicately.  By then there were few save the Hall-Sun under the Roof, and  they but the oldest of the women, or a few very old men, and some who  were ailing and might not go abroad.  But before her on the thwart table  lay the Great War-horn awaiting the coming of Thiodolf to give signal of  departure.    Then went Thiodolf to the Hall-Sun and kissed and embraced her fondly,  and she gave the horn into his hands, and he went forth and up on to the  Hill of Speech, and blew thence a short blast on the horn, and then came  all the Warriors flocking to the Hill of Speech, each man stark in his  harness, alert and joyous.    Then presently through the Man's-door came the Hall-Sun in that ancient  garment, which fell straight and stiff down to her ancles as she stepped  lightly and slowly along, her head crowned with a garland of eglantine.  In her right hand also she held a great torch of wax lighted, whose flame  amidst the bright sunlight looked like a wavering leaf of vermilion.    The warriors saw her, and made a lane for her, and she made her way  through it up to the Hill of Speech, and she went up to the top of it and  stood there holding the lighted candle in her hand, so that all might see  it.  Then suddenly was there as great a silence as there may be on a  forenoon of summer; for even the thralls down in the meadow had noted  what was toward, and ceased their talking and shouting, for as far off as  they were, since they could see that the Hall-Sun stood on the Hill of  Speech, for the wood was dark behind her; so they knew the Farewell Flame  was lighted, and that the maiden would speak; and to all men her speech  was a boding of good or of ill.    So she began in a sweet voice yet clear and far-reaching:       \"O Warriors of the Wolfings by the token of the flame     That here in my right hand flickers, come aback to the House of the     Name!     For there yet burneth the Hall-Sun beneath the Wolfing roof,     And this flame is litten from it, nor as now shall it fare aloof     Till again it seeth the mighty and the men to be gleaned from the     fight.     So wend ye as weird willeth and let your hearts be light;     For through your days of battle all the deeds of our days shall be     fair.     To-morrow beginneth the haysel, as if every carle were here;     And who knoweth ere your returning but the hook shall smite the corn?     But the kine shall go down to the meadow as their wont is every morn,     And each eve shall come back to the byre; and the mares and foals     afield     Shall ever be heeded duly; and all things shall their increase yield.     And if it shall befal us that hither cometh a foe     Here have we swains of the shepherds good players with the bow,     And old men battle-crafty whose might is nowise spent,     And women fell and fearless well wont to tread the bent     Amid the sheep and the oxen; and their hands are hard with the spear     And their arms are strong and stalwart the battle shield to bear;     And store of weapons have we and the mighty walls of the stead;     And the Roof shall abide you steadfast with the Hall-Sun overhead.     Lo here I quench this candle that is lit from the Hall-Sun's flame     Which unto the Wild-wood clearing with the kin of the Wolfings came     And shall wend with their departure to the limits of the earth;     Nor again shall the torch be lighted till in sorrow or in mirth,     Overthrown or overthrowing, ye come aback once more,     And bid me bear the candle before the Wolf of War.\"    As she spake the word she turned the candle downward, and thrust it  against the grass and quenched it indeed; but the whole throng of  warriors turned about, for the bulls of the banner-wain lowered their  heads in the yokes and began to draw, lowing mightily; and the wain  creaked and moved on, and all the men-at-arms followed after, and down  they went through the lanes of the corn, and a many women and children  and old men went down into the mead with them.    In their hearts they all wondered what the Hall-Sun's words might  signify; for she had told them nought about the battles to be, saving  that some should come back to the Mid-mark; whereas aforetime somewhat  would she foretell to them concerning the fortune of the fight, and now  had she said to them nothing but what their own hearts told them.  Nevertheless they bore their crests high as they followed the Wolf down  into the meadow, where all was now ready for departure.  There they  arrayed themselves and went down to the lip of Mirkwood-water; and such  was their array that the banner went first, save that a band of fully  armed men went before it; and behind it and about were the others as well  arrayed as they.  Then went the wains that bore their munition, with  armed carles of the thrall-folk about them, who were ever the guard of  the wains, and should never leave them night or day; and lastly went the  great band of the warriors and the rest of the thralls with them.    As to their war-gear, all the freemen had helms of some kind, but not all  of iron or steel; for some bore helms fashioned of horse-hide and bull-  hide covered over with the similitude of a Wolf's muzzle; nor were these  ill-defence against a sword-stroke.  Shields they all had, and all these  had the image of the Wolf marked on them, but for many their thralls bore  them on the journey.  As to their body-armour some carried long byrnies  of ring-mail, some coats of leather covered with splinters of horn laid  like the shingles of a roof, and some skin-coats only: whereof indeed  there were some of which tales went that they were better than the  smith's hammer-work, because they had had spells sung over them to keep  out steel or iron.    But for their weapons, they bore spears with shafts not very long, some  eight feet of our measure; and axes heavy and long-shafted; and bills  with great and broad heads; and some few, but not many of the kindred  were bowmen, and every freeman was girt with a sword; but of the swords  some were long and two-edged, some short and heavy, cutting on one edge,  and these were of the kind which they and our forefathers long after  called 'sax.'  Thus were the freemen arrayed.    But for the thralls, there were many bows among them, especially among  those who were of blood"]]]
