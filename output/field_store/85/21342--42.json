Some of them indulge in jingo talk about crushing all foreign industries  out of competition, while the others see in technical education nothing  but a means of somewhat improving the flesh-machine of the factory and  of transferring a few workers into the upper class of trained engineers.    Such an ideal may satisfy them, but it cannot satisfy those who keep in  view the combined interests of science and industry, and consider both  as a means for raising humanity to a higher level. We maintain that in  the interests of both science and industry, as well as of society as a  whole, every human being, without distinction of birth, ought to receive  such an education as would enable him, or her, to combine a thorough  knowledge of science with a thorough knowledge of handicraft. We fully  recognize the necessity of specialization of knowledge, but we maintain  that specialization must follow general education, and that general  education must be given in science and handicraft alike. To the division  of society into brain-workers and manual workers we oppose the  combination of both kinds of activities; and instead of \"technical  education,\" which means the maintenance of the present division between  brain work and manual work, we advocate the _education integrale_, or  complete education, which means the disappearance of that pernicious  distinction. Plainly stated, the aims of the school under this system  ought to be the following: To give such an education that, on leaving  school at the age of eighteen or twenty, each boy and each girl should  be endowed with a thorough knowledge of science--such a knowledge as  might enable them to be useful workers in science--and, at the same  time, to give them a general knowledge of what constitutes the bases of  technical training, and such a skill in some special trade as would  enable each of them to take his or her place in the grand world of the  manual production of wealth. I know that many will find that aim too  large, or even impossible to attain, but I hope that if they have the  patience to read the following pages, they will see that we require  nothing beyond what can be easily attained. In fact, _it has been  attained_; and what has been done on a small scale could be done on a  wider scale, were it not for the economical and social causes which  prevent any serious reform from being accomplished in our miserably  organized society.    The experiment has been made at the Moscow Technical School for twenty  consecutive years with many hundreds of boys; and, according to the  testimonies of the most competent judges at the exhibitions of Brussels,  Philadelphia, Vienna and Paris, the experiment has been a success. The  Moscow school admits boys not older than fifteen, and it requires from  boys of that age nothing but a substantial knowledge of geometry and  algebra, together with the usual knowledge of their mother tongue;  younger pupils are received in the preparatory classes. The school is  divided into two sections--the mechanical and the chemical; but as I  personally know better the former, and as it is also the more important  with reference to the question before us, so I shall limit my remarks to  the education given in the mechanical section. After a five or six  years' stay at the school, the students leave it with a thorough  knowledge of higher mathematics, physics, mechanics, and connected  sciences--so thorough, indeed, that it is not second to that acquired in  the best mathematical faculties of the most eminent European  universities. When myself a student of the mathematical faculty of the  St. Petersburg University, I had the opportunity of comparing the  knowledge of the students at the Moscow Technical School with our own. I  saw the courses of higher geometry some of them had compiled for the use  of their comrades; I admired the facility with which they applied the  integral calculus to dynamical problems, and I came to the conclusion  that while we, University students, had more knowledge of a general  character, they, the students of the Technical School, were much more  advanced in higher geometry, and especially in the applications of  higher mathematics to the most intricate problems of dynamics, the  theories of heat and elasticity. But while we, the students of the  University, hardly knew the use of our hands, the students of the  Technical School fabricated _with their own hands_, and without the help  of professional workmen, fine steam-engines, from the heavy boiler to  the last finely turned screw, agricultural machinery, and scientific  apparatus--all for the trade--and they received the highest awards for  the work of their hands at the international exhibitions. They were  scientifically educated skilled workers--workers with university  education--highly appreciated even by the Russian manufacturers who so  much distrust science.    Now, the methods by which these wonderful results were achieved were  these: In science, learning from memory was not in honor, while  independent research was favored by all means. Science was taught hand  in hand with its applications, and what was learned in the schoolroom  was applied in the workshop. Great attention was paid to the highest  abstractions of geometry as a means for developing imagination and  research. As to the teaching of handicraft, the methods were quite  different from those which proved a failure at the Cornell University,  and differed, in fact, from those used in most technical schools. The  student was not sent to a workshop to learn some special handicraft and  to earn his existence as soon as possible, but the teaching of technical  skill was prosecuted--according to a scheme elaborated by the founder of  the school, M. Dellavos, and now applied also at Chicago and Boston--in  the same systematical way as laboratory work is taught in the  universities. It is evident that drawing was considered as the first  step in technical education. Then the student was brought, first, to the  carpenter's workshop, or rather laboratory, and there he was thoroughly  taught to execute all kinds of carpentry and joinery. No efforts were  spared in order to bring the pupil to a certain perfection in that  branch--the real basis of all trades. Later on, he was transferred to  the turner's workshop, where he was taught to make in wood the patterns  of those things which he would have to make in metal in the following  workshops. The foundry followed, and there he was taught to cast those  parts of machines which he had prepared in wood; and it was only after  he had gone through the first three stages that he was admitted to the  smith's and engineering workshops. As for the perfection of the  mechanical work of the students I cannot do better than refer to the  reports of the juries at the above-named exhibitions.    In America the same system has been introduced, in its technical part,  first, in the Chicago Manual Training School, and later on in the Boston  Technical School--the best, I am told, of the sort; and in this  country, or rather in Scotland, I found the system applied with full  success, for some years, under the direction of Dr. Ogilvie at Gordon's  College in Aberdeen. It is the Moscow or Chicago system on a limited  scale. While receiving substantial scientific education, the pupils are  also trained in the workshops--but not for one special trade, as it  unhappily too often is the case. They pass through the carpenter's  workshop, the casting in metals, and the engineering workshop; and in  each of these they learn the foundations of each of the three trades  sufficiently well for supplying the school itself with a number of  useful things. Besides, as far as I could ascertain from what I saw in  the geographical and physical classes, as also in the chemical  laboratory, the system of \"through the hand to the brain,\" and _vice  versa_, is in full swing, and it is attended with the best success. The  boys _work_ with the physical instruments, and they study geography in  the field, instruments in hands, as well as in the class-room. Some of  their surveys filled my heart, as an old geographer, with joy. It is  evident that the Gordon's College industrial department is not a mere  copy of any foreign school; on the contrary, I cannot help thinking that  if Aberdeen has made that excellent move towards combining science with  handicraft, the move was a natural outcome of what has been practised  long since, on a smaller scale, in the Aberdeen daily schools.    The Moscow Technical School surely is not an ideal school.[1] It totally  neglects the humanitarian education of the young men. But we must  recognize that the Moscow experiment--not to speak of hundreds of other  partial experiments--has perfectly well proved the possibility of  combining a scientific education of a very high standard with the  education which is necessary for becoming an excellent skilled laborer.  It has proved, moreover, that the best means for producing really good  skilled laborers is to seize the bull by the horns, and to grasp the  educational problem in its great features, instead of trying to give  some special skill in some handicraft, together with a few scraps of  knowledge in a certain branch of some science. And it has shown also  what can be obtained, without over-pressure, if a rational economy of  the scholar's time is always kept in view, and theory goes hand in hand  with practice. Viewed in this light, the Moscow results do not seem  extraordinary at all, and still better results may be expected if the  same principles are applied from the earliest years of education. Waste  of time is the leading feature of our present education. Not only are we  taught a mass of rubbish, but what is not rubbish is taught so as to  make us waste over it as much time as possible. Our present methods of  teaching originate from a time when the accomplishments required "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#6)"],[1,"methodology:  In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for  countries are reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a  purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Both measures contain information  that is useful to the reader. The PPP method involves the use of  standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to  the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.  The data derived from the PPP method probably provides the best  available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-  being between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange rate method  involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that  may not capture the value of domestic output. Furthermore, exchange  rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market  forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On  12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial  Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued  their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real  output of these countries by half. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD  countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries  are often rough approximations. In developing countries with weak  currencies, the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically  one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Most of the GDP estimates for  developing countries are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers  published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by  Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of  Pennsylvania and their colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method  should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such  as exports, imports, military expenditures, external debt, or the  current account balance, because the dollar values presented in the  Factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange  rates, not at PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the  proportion of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that  share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.  Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a currency  is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP GDP, the  official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa. However,  there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move  in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in the short- or  medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data should  not be chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because  of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by  statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information,  and changes in national statistical methods and practices.    GNP:  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic  production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather  than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad  may be important to national well-being.    GWP:  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value  of all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Geographic coordinates:  This entry includes rounded latitude and  longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic  center of an entity and is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional  Names, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on  other sources.    Geographic names:  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-  Reference List of Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various  alternate names, former names, local names, and regional names  referenced to one or more related Factbook entries. Spellings are  normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN). Alternate names and additional information are included in  parentheses.    Geography:  This category includes the entries dealing with the natural  environment and the effects of human activity.    Geography - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous geographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Gini index:  See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index    Government:  This category includes the entries dealing with the system  for the adoption and administration of public policy.    Government - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous government  information of significance not included elsewhere.      Government type:  This entry gives the basic form of government.  Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows:    Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought  about by the absence of governmental authority.    Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.    Communism - a system of government in which the state plans and  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds  power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private  ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward  a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the  people (i.e., a classless society).    Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority  over all matters except those delegated to the central government.    Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws  and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of  that government.    Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign  power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.    Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is  guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.    Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained  by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a  system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.    Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the  body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives  responsible to them.    Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).    Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.    Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which  the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim  state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.    Federal (Federative) - a form of government in which sovereign power is  formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of  its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central  government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as  upon the regional units.    Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central  government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,  colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate  sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental  representatives.    Islamic republic - a particular form of government adoped by some  Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it  remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the  laws of Islam.    Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China  by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution  is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch  with the people.    Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by  19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as  a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class  struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists  (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"  to, finally, a classless society - Communism.    Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin  from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage  of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed  to underdeveloped countries.    Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the  hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for  life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute  ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with  constitutionally limited authority.    Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group  of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.  Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the legislature  (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or  chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party  strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government  acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the  parliament.    Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a  government in "]]]
