Young women who attempt to be in  school and in society at the same time often bring themselves into the  condition of insomnia or sleeplessness, and foolishly fancy that  because they do not sleep they do not need it.    It is not at all difficult to understand that if you are constantly  taking money out of the bank, you must also be constantly putting  money in, or some day you will be told that your account is already  overdrawn and your draft will not be honored. One can overdraw for a  time, and right here is the danger with young people. They fancy,  because they are not at once told that they are overdrawing, that  their bank account is unlimited, and then, when it is too late, they  find themselves on the verge, if not clear over the verge, of  bankruptcy.    How shall you know whether you sleep enough? If you will make it a  rule to go to bed by ten o'clock every night, and go to sleep at once,  and sleep soundly and waken with a clear head and a rested feeling,  you may infer that you have slept enough. If you are still tired or  dull, something is wrong. You may have been in bed long enough, but  your room may not have been ventilated, and so you may be poisoned by  breathing over and over again the emanations from your own body. Or  for some reason the process of digestion and assimilation may not have  been carried on, and poisons have been created instead of being  eliminated.    If you waken unrefreshed, I should want to inquire into your habits of  life. Was there opportunity for fresh air to enter your room? Was  there in it no uncovered vessel, no old shoes in the closet, no soiled  underclothing, nothing that could contaminate the atmosphere? Did you  eat a hearty supper late in the evening? Is your system oppressed with  a superabundance of sweets? Are you living on simple, wholesome food,  or eating irregularly of all sorts of trash? There may be many causes,  you see, for your \"tired feeling\" in the morning, and instead of  taking some \"Sarsaparilla,\" or other drug, I should try to find out  the cause and remove it.    Many people are afraid of night air, and scrupulously shut it out of  their sleeping-rooms, and yet, what kind of air can you get at night  but night air? And is it not better to have pure night air from out of  doors than the impure night air of a close room? I once went with two  ladies to ascend the Rigi in Switzerland, in order to see the sun  rise. One of these was a Polish countess, who took with her a little  black-and-tan terrier. The hotel at the Rigi Staeffel was crowded, and  we thought ourselves very fortunate to secure a room with three beds.  The Countess disposed herself in one bed with her little dog, and I  took one bed, saying to my friend, \"You'll please open the window  before you go to bed?\" \"O certainly,\" she replied.    The little Countess sprang up in evident alarm. \"Open the window!\" she  cried; \"why, we'd all take our death of cold! I beg of you don't do  it. I could not sleep a wink if the window were open.\"    My friend spoke reassuringly to her, and she at length grew quiet,  when my friend surreptitiously raised a window and we went to sleep.  The next morning the Countess asked, with a strange air of  incredulity, \"Were you in earnest when you spoke about opening the  window? Why, I never heard of such a thing in my life. I know I  should have been ill if you had persisted in having the window open.\"    My friend and I exchanged glances silently. We knew she was not ill  and she had slept with the window open, but doubtless she would have  been ill had she known it was open, for she had a wonderful  imagination. When we were called at three o'clock to get up and go to  the top of the mountain to see the sun rise, she turned herself  luxuriously in her bed and said she could imagine it. She had taken  this journey and \"climbed the mountain\" (that is, was carried up in a  chair, with her dog in her lap), to see the famous sunrise on the  Rigi, and then remained in bed and imagined it! Her imagination seemed  entirely satisfactory, and so we did not quarrel with her.    Sleep is the most positive beautifier, the best cosmetic. The term  \"beauty sleep\" is no misnomer. Sleep freshens the complexion, smoothes  out wrinkles, clears out the brain, strengthens the muscles, puts  light into the eyes and color into the cheek.          CHAPTER V.    BREATHING.      The first thing you did when you came into this world was to inspire,  that is, to breathe in. The last thing you will do will be to expire,  that is, to breathe out. And between your first inspiration and your  last expiration there will have been the process of respiration, that  is, breathing in and out at an average rate of twenty times a minute.  Twenty times a minute means twelve hundred times an hour, or nearly  thirty thousand times a day, or over ten million times a year. If you  should live to be fifty years old, you will have breathed in and out  over five hundred million times. We eat three times a day, twenty-one  times a week, over a thousand times a year, fifty thousand times in  fifty years, but we breathe over five hundred million times in fifty  years.    We realize the importance of eating, but we can live days without  food. On the other hand, we cannot live many seconds entirely without  air. We must infer from all this that breathing is more important than  eating. How can it be? From our food our body is rebuilt. What  life-process is accomplished by breathing?    To understand this, we must learn what processes are going on in the  body, by means of which food is converted into tissue, into heat and  energy. These processes we find are chemical, and may be likened to  the combustion of wood or coal in the furnace. We know that fire must  have air in order to burn. Burning is the process of oxidation or  combustion of oxygen with the atoms of fuel and the formation of a new  substance thereby. Coal, we are told, consists of carbon and nitrogen,  both of which readily combine with oxygen, and in the process of  uniting heat is liberated, and waste compounds thus formed pass off  through the smokestack or chimney. We may not understand this  scientifically, but we know that if we want the fire to burn well we  must give it draft or air.    Our bodies are living engines, and use food and air instead of coal  and air. Food in the body without air is like the coal in an engine  without air; and air is useful only because it brings oxygen to unite  chemically with the food. This process is going on all over the body.  Each little microscopical cell is a furnace in which oxidation is  taking place; and not only is energy liberated, but reconstructive  processes are going on, new tissues are being formed, and old tissues  removed.    But how can the oxygen get to the cells in all parts of the body? We  can readily see how it gets to the air-cells of the lungs, but it  would do little good if it stopped there. It must be carried in some  way to all the minutest cells of all the tissues. This is done through  the breathing. The blood goes to the lungs, and there it gives out the  waste material it has collected in its journey through the body and  takes up oxygen. The blood goes to the lungs dark in color from its  load of waste. It is changed to a bright red by taking up oxygen. Each  red blood-corpuscle takes a load of oxygen, carries it to its  destination, and gives it to some tissue to be used up in the chemical  process of oxidation, upon which depends our life and energy. During  the hours of rest the tissues are busy in this process, and during  exercise the energy stored up in the tissue-cells is liberated and  waste created. So we see that the process is a continual round of  taking food and air, using them in rebuilding tissue, then using up  the tissue by exercise and casting out the waste products. And now we  can begin to understand that we live in proportion as we breathe. Dr.  Holbrook says: \"The activity of the child is in close relation to the  strength of its lungs; so, too, is the calmness, dignity and power of  a man in proportion to the depth and tranquility of his respiration.  If the lungs are strong and active, there is courage and boldness; if  feeble, there is cowardice and debility. To be out of spirits is to be  out of breath. To be animated and joyous is to be full of breath.\"  \"Breathing,\" writes Dr. von der Deeken, \"is an actual vivifying act,  and the need of breath as felt is a real life-hunger and a proof that  without the continual charging of the blood-column with the proper  force, all the other vital organs would soon stagnate and cease action  altogether.\"    Now I wonder how many young women really know how to breathe. \"Why,\"  you say, \"we have always breathed!\" And I reply, \"So you have, to some  extent; but do you really breathe, or do you just let a little current  of air flow gently through a part of your lungs, not reaching the  minute air-cells at all, or have you crippled a large part of your  lung-power by the restrictions of tight clothing?\" Now you shrug your  shoulders and say, with a little irritation, perhaps, \"O, now she is  going to scold about corsets and tight-lacing, and I do not wear my  clothes tight.\" But I am not now going to talk of lacing; I am going  to talk about singing, and speaking, and real living. The highest  class of living creatures are those that have most power to breathe.  The cold-blooded animals breathe little, and are slow-moving creatures  with deficient sensation and small powers of action. Man has large  lung-capacity and should be full of life and power, and will be, if he  understands himself. One benefit of exercise is the added impulse  given to the heart and lungs, calling for more breath, and bringing  more blood to the lungs to receive the added supply of oxygen.    If we were wise we would practise the art of deep, voluntary  breathing, as a daily form of gymnastics. What would it do "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#6)"],[1,"to whom they fled for safety: they spake reproachfully  of them also, and said that they were wizards, and such as called in the  Romans upon them. So the multitude was soon deluded by such plausible  pretenses as were agreeable to their own inclinations, and were  prevailed on by them. But when I was informed of this, I instructed the  multitude again, that those who fled to them for refuge ought not to be  persecuted: I also laughed at the allegation about witchcraft, [13]  and told them that the Romans would not maintain so many ten thousand  soldiers, if they could overcome their enemies by wizards. Upon my  saying this, the people assented for a while; but they returned again  afterwards, as irritated by some ill people against the great men;  nay, they once made an assault upon the house in which they dwelt at  Tarichess, in order to kill them; which, when I was informed of, I was  afraid lest so horrid a crime should take effect, and nobody else would  make that city their refuge any more. I therefore came myself, and some  others with me, to the house where these great men lived, and locked the  doors, and had a trench drawn from their house leading to the lake,  and sent for a ship, and embarked therein with them, and sailed to the  confines of Hippos: I also paid them the value of their horses; nor  in such a flight could I have their horses brought to them. I  then dismissed them, and begged of them earnestly that they would  courageously bear I this distress which befell them. I was also myself I  greatly displeased that I was compelled to expose those that had fled to  me to go again into an enemy's country; yet did I think it more eligible  that they should perish among the Romans, if it should so happen, than  in the country that was under my jurisdiction. However, they escaped at  length, and king Agrippa forgave them their offenses. And this was the  conclusion of what concerned these men.    32. But as for the inhabitants of the city of Tiberias, they wrote to  the king, and desired him to send them forces sufficient to be a guard  to their country; for that they were desirous to come over to him: this  was what they wrote to him. But when I came to them, they desired me to  build their walls, as I had promised them to do; for they had heard that  the walls of Tarichess were already built. I agreed to their proposal  accordingly; and when I had made preparation for the entire building, I  gave order to the architects to go to work; but on the third day, when I  was gone to Tarichess, which was thirty furlongs distant from Tiberias,  it so fell out, that some Roman horsemen were discovered on their march,  not far from the city, which made it to be supposed that the forces were  come from the king; upon which they shouted, and lifted up their voices  in commendations of the king, and in reproaches against me. Hereupon one  came running to me, and told me what their dispositions were, and that  they had resolved to revolt from me: upon hearing which news I was very  much alarmed; for I had already sent away my armed men from Tarichess,  to their own homes, because the next day was our sabbath; for I would  not have the people of Tarichess disturbed [on that day] by a multitude  of soldiers; and indeed, whenever I sojourned at that city, I never took  any particular care for a guard about my own body, because I had had  frequent instances of the fidelity its inhabitants bore to me. I had  now about me no more than seven armed men, besides some friends, and was  doubtful what to do; for to send to recall my own forces I did not think  proper, because the present day was almost over; and had those forces  been with me, I could not take up arms on the next day, because our laws  forbade us so to do, even though our necessity should be very great; and  if I should permit the people of Tarichess, and the strangers with them,  to guard the city, I saw that they would not be sufficient for that  purpose, and I perceived that I should be obliged to delay my assistance  a great while; for I thought with myself that the forces that came from  the king would prevent me, and that I should be driven out of the  city. I considered, therefore, how to get clear of these forces by a  stratagem; so I immediately placed those my friends of Tarichee, on whom  I could best confide, at the gates, to watch those very carefully who  went out at those gates: I also called to me the heads of families, and  bade every one of them to seize upon a ship [14] to go on board it, and  to take a master with them, and follow him to the city of Tiberias. I  also myself went on board one of those ships, with my friends, and the  seven armed men already mentioned, and sailed for Tiberias.    33. But now, when the people of Tiberias perceived that there were no  forces come from the king, and yet saw the whole lake full of ships,  they were in fear what would become of their city, and were greatly  terrified, as supposing that the ships were full of men on board; so  they then changed their minds, and threw down their weapons, and met me  with their wives and children, and made acclamations to me with great  commendations; for they imagined that I did not know their former  inclinations [to have been against me]; so they persuaded me to spare  the city. But when I was come near enough, I gave order to the masters  of the ships to cast anchor a good way off the land, that the people of  Tiberias might not perceive that the ships had no men on board; but  I went nearer to the people in one of the ships, and rebuked them for  their folly, and that they were so fickle as, without any just occasion  in the world, to revolt from their fidelity to me. However, assured them  that I would entirely forgive them for the time to come, if they would  send ten of the ringleaders of the multitude to me; and when they  complied readily with this proposal, and sent me the men forementioned,  I put them on board a ship, and sent them away to Tarichese; and ordered  them to be kept in prison.    34. And by this stratagem it was that I gradually got all the senate of  Tiberias into my power, and sent them to the city forementioned, with  many of the principal men among the populace, and those not fewer  in number than the other. But when the multitude saw into what great  miseries they had brought themselves, they desired me to punish the  author of this sedition: his name was Clitus, a young man, bold and rash  in his undertakings. Now, since I thought it not agreeable to piety to  put one of my own people to death, and yet found it necessary to punish  him, I ordered Levi, one of my own guards, to go to him, and cut off one  of Clitus's hands; but as he that was ordered to do this, was afraid to  go out of the ship alone, among 'so great a multitude, I was not willing  that the timorousness of the soldier should appear to the people of  Tiberias. So I called to Clitus himself and said to him, \"Since thou  deservest to lose both thine hands for thy ingratitude to me, be thou  thine own executioner, lest, if thou refusest so to be, thou undergo a  worse punishment.\" And when he earnestly begged of me to spare him one  of his hands, it was with difficulty that I granted it. So, in order to  prevent the loss of both his hands, he willingly took his sword, and cut  off his own left hand; and this put an end to the sedition.    35. Now the men of Tiberias, after I was gone to Taricheae, perceived  what stratagem I had used against them, and they admired how I had put  an end to their foolish sedition, without shedding of blood. But now,  when I had sent for some of those multitudes of the people of Tiberias  out of prison, among whom were Justus and his father Pistus, I made them  to sup with me; and during our supper time I said to them, that I knew  the power of the Romans was superior to all others, but did not say so  [publicly] because of the robbers. So I advised them to do as I did, and  to wait for a proper opportunity, and not to be uneasy at my being their  commander; for that they could not expect to have another who would use  the like moderation that I had done. I also put Justus in mind how  the Galileans had cut off his brother's hands before ever I came to  Jerusalem, upon an accusation laid against him, as if he had been a  rogue, and had forged some letters; as also how the people of Gamala, in  a sedition they raised against the Babylonians, after the departure of  Philip, slew Chares, who was a kinsman of Philip, and withal how they  had wisely punished Jesus, his brother Justuses sister's husband [with  death]. When I had said this to them during supper time, I in the  morning ordered Justus, and all the rest that were in prison, to be  loosed out of it, and sent away.    36. But before this, it happened that Philip, the son of Jacimus, went  out of the citadel of Gamala upon the following occasion: When Philip  had been informed that Varus was put out of his government by king  Agrippa, and that Equieulus Modius, a man that was of old his friend and  companion, was come to succeed him, he wrote to him, and related what  turns of fortune he had had, and desired him to forward the letters he  sent to the king and queen. Now, when Modius had received these letters,  he was exceedingly glad, and sent the letters to the king and queen, who  were then about Berytus. But when king Agrippa knew that the story about  Philip was false, [for it had been given out, that the Jews had begun  a war with the Romans, and that this Philip had been their commander in  that war,] he sent some horsemen to conduct Philip to him; and when he  was come, he saluted him very obligingly, and showed him to the Roman  commanders, and told them that this was the man of whom the report had  gone about as if he had revolted from the Romans. He also bid him to  take some horsemen with him, and to go quickly to the citadel of  Gamala, and to bring out thence"]]]
