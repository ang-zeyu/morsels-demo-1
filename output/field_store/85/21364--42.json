The first he thought of was to make use of his rifle.  The weapon was  within his reach where he had dropped it when diving under the tree; but  when about to reload it, he discovered that the ramrod was missing!    So sudden had been the charge of the borele, at the time the rifle was  last loaded, that the ramrod had not been returned to its proper place,  but left behind upon the plain.  This was an unlucky circumstance; and  for a time the young hunter could not think of anything better than to  keep turning from side to side, to avoid the presence of the besieger.    The borele at last seemed to show signs of exhaustion, or, at all  events, began to perceive the unprofitable nature of the tactics it had  been pursuing.  But the spirit of revenge was not the least weakened  within it, for it made no move toward taking its departure from the  spot.  On the contrary, it lay down by the baobab in a position to  command a view on both sides of the huge trunk, evidently determined to  stay there and await the chance of getting within reach of its victim.    Thus silently beleaguered, the young hunter set about considering in  what manner he might accomplish the raising of the siege.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    RESCUED.    The sun went down, the moon ascended above the tops of the surrounding  trees, yet the borele seemed no less inspired by the spirit of revenge  than on first receiving the injuries it was wishing to resent.    For many hours the young hunter waited patiently for it to move away in  search of food or any other object except that of revenge; but in this  hope he was disappointed.  The pain inflicted by the shots would not  allow either hunger or thirst to interfere with the desire for  retaliation, and it continued to maintain a watch so vigilant that Arend  dared not leave his retreat for an instant.  Whenever he made a  movement, the enemy did the same.    It was a long time before he could think of any plan that would give him  a chance of getting away.  One at length occurred to him.    Although unable to reload the rifle with a bullet, the thought came into  his mind, that the borele might be blinded by a heavy charge of powder,  or so confused by it as to give him an opportunity of stealing away.  This seemed an excellent plan, yet so simple that Arend was somewhat  surprised he had not thought of it before.    Without difficulty he succeeded in pouring a double quantity of powder  into the barrel; and, in order to keep it there until he had an  opportunity for a close shot, some dry grass was forced into the muzzle.  The chance soon offered; and, taking a deliberate aim at one of the  borele's eyes with the muzzle of the gun not more than two feet from its  head, he pulled trigger.    With a loud moan of mingled rage and agony, the rhinoceros rushed  towards him, and frantically, but vainly exerted all its strength in an  endeavour to overturn the baobab.    \"One more shot at the other eye,\" thought Arend, \"and I shall be free.\"    He immediately proceeded to pour another dose of powder into the rifle,  but while thus engaged a new danger suddenly presented itself.  The dry  grass projected from the gun had ignited and set fire to the dead leaves  that were strewed plentifully over the ground.  In an instant these were  ablaze, the flame spreading rapidly on all sides, and moving towards  him.    The trunk of the baobab could no longer afford protection.  In another  minute it, too, would be enveloped in the red fire, and to stay by its  side would be to perish in the flames.  There was no alternative but to  get to his feet and run for his life.    Not a moment was to be lost, and, slipping from under the tree, he  started off at the top of his speed.  The chances were in his favour for  escaping unobserved by the rhinoceros.  But fortune seemed decidedly  against him.  Before getting twenty paces from the tree, he saw that he  was pursued.    Guided either by one eye or its keen sense of hearing, the monster was  following him at a pace so rapid that, if long enough continued, it must  certainly overtake him.    Once more the young hunter began to feel something like despair.  Death  seemed hard upon his heels.  A few seconds more, and he might be impaled  on that terrible horn.  But for that instinctive love of life which all  feel, he might have surrendered himself to fate; but urged by this, he  kept on.    He was upon the eve of falling to the earth through sheer exhaustion,  when his ears were saluted by the deep-toned bay of a hound, and close  after it a voice exclaiming--    \"Look out, Baas Willem!  Somebody come yonder!\"    Two seconds more and Arend was safe from further pursuit.  The hound  Spoor'em was dancing about the borele's head, by his loud, angry yelps  diverting its attention from everything but himself.    Two seconds more and Groot Willem and Hendrik came riding up; and, in  less than half a minute after, the monster, having received a shot from  the heavy roer, slowly settled down in its tracks--a dead rhinoceros.    Willem and Hendrik leaped from their horses and shook hands with Arend  in a manner as cordial as if they were just meeting him after an absence  of many years.    \"What does it mean, Arend?\" jocosely inquired Hendrik.  \"Has this brute  been pursuing you for the last twelve hours?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And how much longer do you think the chase would have continued?\"    \"About ten seconds,\" replied Arend, speaking in a very positive tone.    \"Very well,\" said Hendrik, who was so rejoiced at the deliverance of his  friend that he felt inclined to be witty.  \"We know now how long you are  capable of running.  You can lead a borele a chase of just twelve hours  and ten seconds.\"    Groot Willem was for some time unspeakably happy, and said not a word  until they had returned to the place where the lion had been killed.  Here they stopped for the purpose of recovering the saddle and bridle  from the carcass of the horse.    Groot Willem proposed they should remain there till the morning; his  reason being that, in returning through the narrow path that led out to  the open plain, they might be in danger of meeting buffaloes,  rhinoceroses, or elephants, and be trampled to death in the darkness.    \"That's true,\" replied Arend; \"and it might be better to stay here until  daylight, but for two reasons.  One is, that I am dying of hunger, and  should like a roast rib of that antelope I shot in the morning.\"    \"And so should I,\" said Hendrik, \"but the jackals have saved us the  trouble of eating that.\"    Arend was now informed of the events that had occurred to his absence,  and was highly amused at Hendrik's account of the misfortune that had  befallen Swartboy and Congo.    \"We are making a very fair commencement in the way of adventures,\" said  he, after relating his own experiences of the day, \"but so far our  expedition has been anything but profitable.\"    \"We must go farther down the river,\" said Willem.  \"We have not yet seen  the spoor of either hippopotamus or giraffe.  We must keep moving until  we come upon them.  I never want to see another lion, borele, or  elephant.\"    \"But what is your other reason for going back to camp?\" asked Hendrik,  addressing himself to Arend.    \"What would it be?\" replied Arend.  \"Do you suppose that our dear friend  Hans has no feelings?\"    \"O, that's what you mean, is it?\"    \"Of course it is.  Surely Hans will by this time be half dead with  anxiety on our account.\"    All agreed that it would be best to go on to the camp; and, after  transferring the saddle and bridle from the carcass of the horse to the  shoulders of Congo, they proceeded onward, arriving in camp at a very  late hour, and finding Hans, as Arend had conjectured, overwhelmed with  apprehension at their long absence.        CHAPTER NINE.    AN INCIDENT OF THE ROAD.    Next morning, they broke up their camp and moved down the river,  extending their march into the second day.    After passing the drift where the Limpopo had been first crossed, Groot  Willem, accompanied by Congo, was riding nearly a mile in advance of his  companions.  His object in leading the way so far ahead was to bag any  game worthy of his notice, before it should be frightened by the others.    Occasionally, a small herd of some of the many varieties of antelopes in  which South Africa abounds fled before him; but these the great hunter  scarce deigned to notice.  His thief object was to find a country  frequented by hippopotami and giraffes.    On his way he passed many of the lofty pandanus or screw pine-trees.  Some of these were covered from top to bottom with parasitic plants,  giving them the appearance of tall towers or obelisks.  Underneath one  of these trees, near the river, and about three hundred yards from where  he was riding, he saw a buffalo cow with her calf.  The sun was low  down; and the time had therefore arrived when some buffalo veal would be  acceptable both to the men and dogs of the expedition.    Telling Congo to stay where he was, the hunter rode to the leeward of  the buffalo cow, and, under cover of some bushes, commenced making  approach.  Knowing that a buffalo cow is easily alarmed, more especially  when accompanied by her calf, he made his advances with the greatest  caution.  Knowing, also, that no animal shows more fierceness and  contempt for danger, while protecting its young, he was anxious to get a  dead shot, so as to avoid the risk of a conflict with the cow, should  she be only wounded.  When he had got as close as the cover would allow  him, he took aim at the cow's heart and fired.    Contrary to his expectation, the animal neither fell nor fled, but  merely turned an inquiring glance in the direction from whence the  report had proceeded.    This was a mystery the hunter could not explain.  Why did the cow keep  to the same spot?

But to find a city is one thing, and to get hold of its inhabitants is  another and a very different one. One of the Indians was an elderly man  who in the old days had trapped beaver in Canada for the Hudson Bay  Company, and he assumed the direction of the work. First of all they  chopped holes in the ice and drove a line of stakes across the stream  just above the pond, so that no one might escape in that direction.  Then, by pounding on the ice, and cutting more holes in it here and  there, they found the entrances to all the lodges and most of the  burrows, and closed them also with stakes driven into the bottom.  Fortunately they did not find the burrow where our Beaver and his wife  had taken refuge. They were about to break open the roofs of the lodges  when the old man proposed that they should play a trick on one of the  beaver families--a trick which his father had taught him when he was a  boy, and when the beavers were many in the woods around Lake Superior.  He described it with enthusiasm, and his companions agreed that it would  be great fun. For a time there was much chopping of ice and driving of  stakes, and then all was quiet again.    By and by one of our Beaver's children began to feel hungry, and as his  father and mother had not come home he decided to go out to the  wood-pile and get something to eat. So he took a header from his bed  into the water, and swam down the angle. The door had been unbarred  again, and he passed out without difficulty, but when he reached the  pile he found it surrounded by a fence made of stakes set so close  together that he could not pass between them. He swam clear around it,  and at last found one gap just wide enough to admit his body. He passed  in, and as he did so his back grazed a small twig which had been thrust  down through a hole in the ice, and the watching Indians saw it move,  and knew that a beaver had entered the trap. He picked out a nice stick  of convenient size, and started to return to the lodge. But where was  that gap in the fence? This was the place, he was sure. Here were two  stakes between which he had certainly passed as he came in, but now  another stood squarely between them, and the gate was barred. He swam  all round the wood-pile, looking for a way out, and poking his little  brown nose between the stakes, but there was no escape, and when he came  back to the entrance and found it still closed his last hope died, and  he gave up in despair. His heart and lungs and all his circulatory  apparatus had been so designed by the Great Architect that he might live  for many minutes under water, but they could not keep him alive  indefinitely. Overhead was the ice, and all around was that cruel fence.  Only a rod away was home, where his brothers and sisters were waiting  for him, and where there was air to breathe and life to live--but he  could not reach it. You have all read or heard how a drowning man feels,  and I suppose it is much the same with a drowning beaver. They say it is  an easy death.    By and by a hooked stick came down through a hole in the ice and drew  him out, the gate was unbarred, the twig was replaced, and the Indians  waited for another hungry little beaver to come for his dinner. That's  enough. You know now what the parents found when they came home--or  rather what they didn't find.    It would have taken too long to dispose of the whole city in this way,  so the Indians finally broke the dam and let the water out of the pond,  and then they tore open the lodges and all the burrows they could find,  and the inhabitants were put to the--not the sword, but the axe and the  club. Of all those who had been so happy and prosperous, the old Beaver  and his wife were the only ones who escaped; and their lives were spared  only because the Indians failed to find their hiding-place.    That was the end of the second city, but it was not quite the end of the  beavers. A few miles up-stream they dug a short burrow in the bank and  tried to make a new home. In May another baby came, but only one, and it  was dead before it was born. Next day the mother died too, and the  Beaver left the burrow and went out into the world alone. I really think  his heart was broken, though it continued to beat for several months  longer.    Just northeast of the Glimmerglass there lies a long, narrow pond, whose  shores are very low and swampy, and whose waters drain into the larger  lake through a short stream only a few rods in length. Hundreds,  perhaps thousands, of years ago the narrow strip of land that separates  them may possibly have been a beaver-dam, but to-day it is hard to tell  it from one of Nature's own formations. In the course of his lonely  wanderings the Beaver reached this pond, and here he established himself  to spend his last few weeks. He was aging rapidly. Such a little while  ago he had seemed in the very prime of life, and had been one of the  handsomest beavers in the woods, with fur of the thickest and softest  and silkiest, and a weight of probably sixty pounds. Now he was thin and  lean, his hair was falling out, his teeth were losing their sharp edges  and becoming blunt and almost useless, and even his flat tail was  growing thicker and more rounded, and its whack was not as startling as  of old when he brought it down with all his might on the surface of the  water.    Yet even now the old instinct flamed up and burned feebly for a little  while. Or shall we say the old love of work, and of using the powers and  faculties that God had given him? Why should the thing that is called  genius in a man be set down as instinct when we see it on a somewhat  smaller scale in an animal? Whatever it was, the ruling passion was  still strong. All his life he had been a civil engineer; and now, one  dark, rainy autumn night, he left his shallow burrow, swam down the pond  to its outlet, and began to build a dam. The next day, pushing up the  shallow stream in my dug-out canoe, I saw the alder-cuttings lying in  its bed, with the marks of his dull teeth on their butts. God knows why  he did it, or what he was thinking about as he cut those bushes and  dragged them into the water. I don't; but sometimes I wonder if a wild  dream of a new lodge, a new mate, a new home, and a new city was  flitting through his poor, befogged old brain.    It was only a few nights later that he put his foot into Charlie Roop's  beaver-trap, jumped for deep water, and was drowned like his father  before him. Charlie afterward showed me the pelt, which he had stretched  on a hoop made of a little birch sapling. It was not a very good pelt,  for, as I said, the Beaver had been losing his hair, but Charlie thought  he might get a dollar or two for it. Whether he needed the dollar more  than the Beaver needed his skin was a question which it seemed quite  useless to discuss.    As we left the shack I noticed the tail lying on the ground just outside  the door.    \"Why don't you eat it?\" I asked. \"Don't you know that a beaver's tail is  supposed to be one of the finest delicacies in the woods?\"    \"Huh!\" said Charlie. \"I'd rather have salt pork.\"          THE KING OF THE TROUT STREAM      IT was winter, and the trout stream ran low in its banks, hidden from  the sky by a thick shell of ice and snow, and not seeing the sun for a  season. But the trout stream was used to that, and it slipped along in  the darkness, undismayed and not one whit disheartened; talking to  itself in low, murmuring tones, and dreaming of the time when spring  would come back and all the rivers would be full.    Mingled with its waters, and borne onward and downward by the ceaseless  flow of its current, went multitudes of the tiniest air-bubbles, most of  them too small ever to be seen by a human eye, yet large enough to be  the very breath of life to thousands and thousands of creatures. Some of  them found their way to the gills of the brook trout, and some to the  minnows, and the herrings, and the suckers, and the star-gazers; some  fed the little crustacea, and the insect larvae, and the other tiny water  animals that make up the lower classes of society; and some passed  undetained down the river and out into Lake Superior. But there were  others that worked down into the gravel of the riverbed; and there, in  the nooks and crannies between the pebbles, they found a vast number of  little balls of yellow-brown jelly, about as large as small peas, which  seemed to be in need of their kindly ministrations. And the air-bubbles  touched the trout eggs gently and lovingly, and in some mysterious and  wonderful way their oxygen passed in through the pores of the shells,  and the embryos within were quickened and stirred to a new vigor and a  more rapid growth.    Not all of the eggs were alive. Some had been crushed between the  stones; some were buried in sediment, which had choked the pores and  kept away the friendly oxygen until they smothered; and some had never  really lived at all. But one danger they had been spared, for there were  no saw-mills on the stream to send a flood of fungus-breeding sawdust  down with the current. And in spite of all the misfortunes and disasters  to which trout eggs are liable, a goodly number of them were doing quite  as well as could be expected. I suppose one could hardly say that they  were being incubated, for, according to the dictionaries, to incubate is  to sit upon, and certainly there was no one sitting on them. Their  mothers had not come near them since the day they were laid. But the  gravel hid them from the eyes of egg-eating fishes and musk-rats; the  water kept them cold, but not too cold; the fresh oxygen came and  encouraged them if ever they grew tired and dull, and so the good work  went on.    Through each thin, leathery, semi-transparent shell you could have seen,  if you had examined it closely, a pair of"]]]
