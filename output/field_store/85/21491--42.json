As the activity of the present age developes itself mainly through  productive and commercial industry, this collection of the choicest  industrial products of all the nations of the globe, is not only in  perfect accordance with the spirit of the epoch, but seems indeed to  belong so properly to the present day, that it may be doubted whether  such an event could have taken place at any earlier period: while the  political and social conditions of Great Britain, her friendly relations  with all other powers, together with the perfect security for property,  the commercial freedom, and facilities of transport, which are here  enjoyed in a pre-eminent degree, combine to indicate this country as the  most appropriate arena for this first pacific contest of the nations;  the only one, perhaps, in the actual state of Europe, in which it could  have taken place at this time.    The traditions of the English people, also, are such as would naturally  suggest to them the idea of an enterprise of this kind; for not only  have Fairs (which may be regarded as a rude attempt at a more general  exhibition of wares than that afforded by the mere ordinary display of  shops) been common here, as elsewhere in Europe, for many centuries, but  exhibitions more nearly resembling the present Institution, in which the  palm of excellence, rather than direct commerce, is the primary object,  have taken place here frequently during the past century, through the  enterprise of individuals, or societies, independently of any assistance  from the Government. As early as the year 1756, the \"Society of Arts\" of  London offered prizes for the best specimens of various manufactures,  tapestry, carpets, porcelain, &c., and held public exhibitions of the  works which were offered in competition; while about the same period,  the Royal Academy, as a private society, patronized by George the Third,  rather in a personal capacity than as the head of the legislature,  organized its exhibitions of painting, sculpture, and engraving; and  during the last thirty years exhibitions of machinery and manufactures,  gotten up entirely through the efforts of private individuals, have  taken place not only in the metropolitan cities, in London, Edinburgh,  and Dublin, but in all the principal towns of the United Kingdom.    The earliest national exhibition of industrial products in France,  occurred in 1798, and was followed by others at irregular intervals  until 1819, since which period they have taken place every five years,  and have exercised a marked effect upon the industrial development of  Europe. The brilliant character of the two last of these exhibitions (in  '44 and '49), led to several ineffectual attempts on the part of the  Society of Arts, and others, to interest the British Government in the  getting up of a similar exhibition of the products of British industry,  to be held in 1851.    At length in 1849, Prince Albert, who, as President of the Society of  Arts, had known and sanctioned all these proceedings, took the project  under his own personal superintendence, enlarged upon the original  design by proposing to invite the co-operation and competition of all  foreign nations, and proceeded to settle the principles upon which the  enterprise, thus modified, should be conducted, and the mode in which  it should be carried out.    The first steps toward the realization of this new plan, were made in  the name, and under the auspices of the Society of Arts; but so  universal was the interest which this noble project called forth  throughout the country, that it was thought advisable to make it a  national concern, by taking it out of the hands of the Society, and  intrusting its execution to a body of royal commissioners, appointed for  that purpose by the Government, with Prince Albert as its President; the  Government, meantime, giving its sanction only to the undertaking, and  merely lending its aid when it was absolutely indispensable, as in  correspondence with foreign countries, providing a site for the  building, organization of police, and the cost of such assistance  whenever it entailed expense, being defrayed from the funds of the  Exhibition, thus leaving all the responsibility of the attempt,  pecuniary or other, with the commissioners themselves.    The subsequent history of the \"rise and progress\" of the undertaking;  the promptitude with which the requisite funds were subscribed by  private generosity; the selection of Hyde Park as the site of the  projected Industrial Palace; the various plans proposed for the  building, and the final adoption of the design of Mr. Paxton, after the  model of a conservatory by him erected for the Duke of Devonshire; the  admirable manner in which this design has been carried out by the  architects, Messrs. Fox & Henderson; the cordial response with which  England's friendly challenge has been answered by all the peoples of the  globe, from her next-door neighbors across the channel, to the far-off  denizens of Orient, and remote islands of sunny southern seas; the  imposing ceremonial which, on the appointed day, threw open the vast  Museum to the gaze of an impatient public; the crowds of titled dames  and potent seigneurs, of the \"wealth, beauty and fashion\" of the  aristocratic world, that fill, day after day, the immense area,  wandering from one magnificent display to another, and marvelling at the  richness, perfection, and variety of the countless objects that meet  their eyes at every turn; the probability of a somewhat formidable  thronging of less elegant, but equally interested visitors, when the  \"shilling days\" begin; the fabulous wealth flowing, week after week,  into the treasury of the royal commissioners at the various entrances of  the buildings; and the growing desire on the part of the public, that  the funds, thus arising from the Exhibition itself, should be  appropriated to the formation of a \"Permanent Museum of the Art and  Industry of all Nations;\" all this is too well known to call for further  comment.    The first impression created by the interior aspect of the Crystal  Palace, is one of admiration. Magnificent indeed is the lofty dome of  the transept, arching over glorious old trees, oriental shrubbery,  statuary, fountains, and masses of gorgeous flowers; the brilliant  perspective of the central aisle, with its double lines of galleries,  stretching away on either hand, and traversed by countless avenues,  every point of the vast expanse presenting its own special subject of  interest, and challenging the beholder's gaze. But so extensive and  various is this great collection, so striking are the contrasts of form,  color, and use, presented by the endless succession of objects that meet  the eye in every direction, that the sentiment of admiration soon gives  place to a feeling of hopeless bewilderment. A careful study of maps and  catalogues, and many visits, spent in making a general survey of the  various departments of the building, are indispensable preliminaries to  a more intimate acquaintance with the admirable objects contained in  each. But the topographic and distributive arrangements of the building  understood, the chaos of one's impressions becomes gradually into order;  and the work of examination goes on with more success.    The transept and the western wing are occupied by Great Britain and her  colonial possessions; the eastern wing is appropriated to foreign  nations, the countries lying nearest the tropics being ranged  immediately round the transept. Objects of art and artistical industry  occupy the central portions of the building; raw materials, machinery,  hardware, and carriages being placed nearest to the walls. The objects  admitted to the exhibition come under four general categories: raw  materials, machinery, manufactures, and fine arts, and are divided into  thirty classes, an arrangement which greatly facilitates the business of  investigation and comparison.    Many of the Oriental nations are very fully represented, especially  India; it would be difficult to cite any department of Indian life and  industry not illustrated in the ample collections of her natural and  manufactured products, gathered together with the utmost care. China,  Tunis, Persia, and the islands of the Indian archipelago, are also here  in great force, and make a very brilliant display. The exquisite texture  of many of their woven fabrics, the richness of color and effect, the  incredible _fineness_ and delicacy of workmanship displayed in many of  their manufactured articles, prepared with the aid only of the rudest  tools, often surpass all that the enlightened skill of European artisans  can accomplish, and may furnish western industry with many valuable  models and precious suggestions for future use. But the beauty of  eastern productions lies solely in perfection of detail; there is  nothing large, generous, or comprehensive in barbaric industry. All that  its resources can accomplish is lavished on objects of parade and  luxury, often absolutely useless, and always destined for the privileged  few; the element of ordinary existence, all that goes to make up the  daily life of the masses, is coarse and rudimentary. These shawls,  which, for fineness of texture, richness of color, and beauty of design,  leave the choicest productions of European looms at an immeasurable  distance; these muslins and gauzes, finer than gossamer, yet covered  with exquisite traceries in gold and silver thread, fabrics that seem  too etherially light to be worn by others than the ladies of Titania's  court; these silks and satins, and damasks of admirable texture, and of  richest dyes; these magnificent garments, stiff gold embroidery, with  precious stones and with tinsel whose glancing hues produce an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33967"],[0,"Descriptions of New Hylid Frogs From Mexico and Central America (#6)"],[1,"965:166) listed a specimen (TCWC 16184) of _Hyla chaneque_  from Los Fustes, 3 kilometers east of San Sebastian, Oaxaca.  Reexamination of this specimen reveals that it is _Hyla altipotens_.  The frog was obtained by Dilford Carter on April 29, 1960; it was under  a rock at the edge of a stream in an oak-pine-cypress association at an  elevation of 1800 meters.    The specific name _altipotens_ is Latin, meaning mighty, here used in  allusion to the supposed potentiality of fertilization by the production  of vast quantities of sperm in the large testes.      Plectrohyla hartwegi new species    Plate 19    _Holotype._--Adult male, UMMZ 94428, from Barrejonel (19 kilometers west  of Chicomuselo), Chiapas, Mexico, elevation 1000 meters, obtained on  June 12, 1941, by Eizi Matuda.    _Paratypes._--Two subadult males, KU 58873 from Paraje El Triunfo, north  of Mapastepec, Chiapas, Mexico, elevation 2050 meters, obtained on May  12, 1960, by Miguel Alvarez del Toro, and UIMNH 40837 from Cerro Azul  Oaxaca, Mexico, obtained on March 7, 1956, by Thomas MacDougall.    _Diagnosis._--A _Plectrohyla_ having a bifid prepollex, bold mottling on  flanks and ventral surfaces of shanks, and vertical dark bars on  anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, and lacking vocal slits and  outer tarsal fold.    _Description of holotype._--Adult male having a snout-vent length of  63.8 mm.; tibia length 34.9 mm., 54.7 per cent of snout-vent length;  foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to  tip of longest toe) 31.1 mm., 48.7 per cent of snout-vent length; head  length 19.7 mm., 30.9 per cent of snout-vent length; head width 22.6  mm., 35.4 per cent of snout-vent length. Snout short, distance from  level of anterior edge of orbit to tip of snout 70.6 per cent of length  of eye; snout in lateral profile angular, sloping abruptly from nostrils  to jaw, in dorsal profile bluntly rounded, lacking rostral keel; canthal  ridge thickened; loreal region deeply concave; lips thick, barely  flared. Nostrils small, barely protuberant, directed anterolaterally,  situated about two-thirds distance from eye to tip of snout; internarial  distance 5.6 mm. internarial area barely depressed near convergence of  canthal ridges; top of head flat; interorbital distance 6.4 mm., 28.3  per cent of head width; diameter of eye 6.8 mm.; width of eyelid 5.5  mm., 24.3 per cent of head width. Heavy dermal fold extending  posteriorly from posterior edge of orbit, covering upper edge of  tympanum; two thinner folds extending ventrally from longitudinal heavy  fold covering posterior edge of tympanum; anterior and ventral edges of  tympanum distinct; length of tympanum 2.9 mm., 42.6 per cent of diameter  of eye.    Axillary membrane absent; arms robust, forearm not noticeably heavier  than upper arm; distinct transverse fold on wrist. Fingers long,  moderately slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3;  discs moderately large, that on third finger larger than tympanum;  webbing vestigial; subarticular tubercles small, conical; terminal  tubercle on fourth finger somewhat flattened; supernumerary tubercles  small, in one row on proximal segment of fourth finger and in two rows  on proximal segments of other fingers; prepollex greatly enlarged,  barely bifurcate; spines not protruding through skin; distal spine much  longer than proximal one (Fig. 2). Heels overlap by about one-third  length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation  extends slightly beyond snout; heavy transverse dermal fold on heel;  inner tarsal fold heavy, extending full length of tarsus; outer tarsal  fold absent; inner metatarsal tubercle high, elliptical, visible from  above, outer metatarsal tubercle absent. Toes long, slender; length of  toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4; fifth toe nearly as long as  third; discs small; subarticular tubercles small, round; supernumerary  tubercles small, in single row on proximal segment of each digit; toes  about three-fourths webbed; webbing extending from base of disc of first  toe to base of penultimate phalanx of third, from base of disc of third  to base of penultimate phalanx of fourth to base of disc of fifth toe.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Palmar view of prepollical spine of right hand of  _Plectrohyla hartwegi_ (UMMZ 94428). x 5.]    Anal opening directed posteroventrally at level of mid-thigh; anal  sheath long with membranous connection to posterior surfaces of thighs.  Skin on dorsal surfaces finely tuberculate; that on throat, chest,  belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular, that on ventral surfaces  of arms and shanks smooth. Tongue nearly round, free posteriorly for  about one-fourth its length, barely notched behind. Upper jaw shallowly  notched medially. Maxillary-premaxillary teeth 38-35; prevomerine teeth  5-5, situated on small elliptical elevations between quadrangular  choanae; vocal slits absent.    Color (in preservative): uniform dull brown above and creamy yellow  below; flanks brown with creamy yellow mottling and dark brown spots in  groin; anterior surfaces of thighs creamy yellow with two broad,  vertical, dark brown bars proximally and two narrower, dull brown bars  distally; posterior surfaces of thighs brown with dark brown vertical  bars, interspaces cream-colored or brown. Ventral surfaces of shanks  creamy yellow with bold brown reticulations.    _Variation._--The paratypes are smaller, having snout-vent lengths of  48.3 and 41.8 mm. In these specimens the ratio of the length of the  tibia to the snout-vent length is 55.9 and 57.9 per cent, and the ratio  of the diameter of the tympanum to the diameter of the eye is 47.3 and  43.6 per cent, respectively. Both specimens have 4-4 prevomerine teeth;  one specimen has 37-36, and the other has 40-37, maxillary-premaxillary  teeth. In these small specimens the supratympanic fold is thin, and the  arms are not so robust as in the holotype. In one specimen (KU 58873)  the tongue is not notched posteriorly. The terminal subarticular  tubercle on each fourth finger is broad and flattened in UIMNH 40837,  but conical in KU 58873. Both specimens have bold creamy-yellow and dark  brown mottling on the flanks and dark brown reticulations on the ventral  surfaces of the shanks. There are two dark brown vertical bars on the  anterior and posterior surfaces of each thigh in KU 58873 and three bars  on each surface in UIMNH 40837.    _Comparisons._--_Plectrohyla hartwegi_ differs from all known species in  the genus by having boldly mottled flanks, dark reticulations on the  ventral surfaces of the shanks, and dark vertical bars on the shanks. In  all of the other species the anterior and posterior surfaces of the  thighs are unmarked, and the flanks are either plain or marked with  small spots or flecks. Structurally, _P. hartwegi_ belongs in the  _guatemalensis_ group of the genus, containing _avia_, _glandulosa_,  _guatemalensis_, and _pycnochila_. The species in this group lack vocal  slits and have either large, rectangular, or bifid prepollices.  _Plectrohyla hartwegi_ differs from all of these species, except  _pycnochila_, by having a tuberculate, instead of a smooth, dorsum, and  _hartwegi_ differs from _pycnochila_ by having a bifid, instead of a  rectangular, prepollex.    _Remarks._--The known distribution of _Plectrohyla hartwegi_ includes  three localities at elevations of 1000 to 2050 meters in the Sierra  Madre of Chiapas and extreme eastern Oaxaca. The specimen from Paraje El  Triunfo was found in a rocky stream in cloud forest at an elevation of  2050 meters. One _Plectrohyla sagorum_ was obtained from the same  stream.    Eizi Matuda sent the holotype to the late Dr. Norman Hartweg, who  recognized that the specimen was unique but was reluctant to name the  species on the basis of a single specimen. Now that two additional  specimens are available, it seems appropriate to associate Hartweg's  name with this new species of _Plectrohyla_, a genus that Hartweg first  adequately defined.
