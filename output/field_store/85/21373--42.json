Id in pilis ex lana arcte conglomerata & fortiter  constricta sic tentavi. Primum demittendo Pendula & mensurando reflexionem,  inveni quantitatem vis Elasticæ; deinde per hanc vim determinavi  reflexiones in aliis casibus concursuum, & respondebant experimenta.  Redibant semper pilæ ab invicem cum velocitate relativa, quæ esset ad  velocitatem relativam concursus ut 5 ad 9 circiter. Eadem fere cum  velocitate redibant pilæ ex chalybe: aliæ ex subere cum paulo minore. In  vitreis autem proportio erat 15 ad 16 circiter. Atq; hoc pacto Lex tertia  quoad ictus & reflexiones per Theoriam comprobata est, quæ cum experientia  plane congruit.    In attractionibus rem sic breviter ostendo. Corporibus duobus quibusvis A,  B se mutuo trahentibus, concipe obstaculum quodvis interponi quo congressus  eorum impediatur. Si corpus alterutrum A magis trahitur versus corpus  alterum B, quam illud alterum B in prius A, obstaculum magis urgebitur  pressione corporis A quam pressione corporis B; proindeq; non manebit in  æquilibrio. Prævalebit pressio fortior, facietq; systema corporum duorum &  obstaculi moveri in directum in partes versus B, motuq; in spatiis liberis  semper accelerato abire in infinitum. Quod est absurdum & Legi primæ  contrarium. Nam per Legem primam debebit systema perseverare in statu suo  quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, proindeq; corpora æqualiter  urgebunt obstaculum, & idcirco æqualiter trahentur in invicem. Tentavi hoc  in Magnete & ferro. Si hæc in vasculis propriis sese contingentibus seorsim  posita, in aqua stagnante juxta fluitent, neutrum propellet alterum, sed  æqualitate attractionis utrinq; sustinebunt conatus in se mutuos, ac tandem  in æquilibrio constituta quiescent.    Ut corpora in concursu & reflexione idem pollent, quorum velocitates sunt  reciproce ut vires insitæ: sic in movendis Instrumentis Mechanicis agentia  idem pollent & conatibus contrariis se mutuo sustinent, quorum velocitates  secundum determinationem virium æstimatæ, sunt reciproce ut vires. Sic  pondera æquipollent ad movenda brachia Libræ, quæ oscillante Libra, sunt  reciproce ut eorum velocitates sursum & deorsum: hoc est pondera, si recta  ascendunt & descendunt, æquipollent, quæ sunt reciproce ut punctorum a  quibus suspenduntur distantiæ ab axe Libræ; sin planis obliquis aliisve  admotis obstaculis impedita ascendunt vel descendunt oblique, æquipollent  quæ sunt ut ascensus & descensus quatenus facti secundum perpendiculum: id  adeo ob determinationem gravitatis deorsum. Similiter in Trochlea seu  Polyspasto vis manus funem directe trahentis, quæ sit ad pondus vel directe  vel oblique ascendens ut velocitas ascensus perpendicularis ad velocitatem  manus funem trahentis, sustinebit pondus. In horologiis & similibus  instrumentis, quæ ex rotulis commissus constructa sunt, vires contrariæ ad  motum rotularum promovendum & impediendum si sunt reciproce ut velocitates  partium rotularum in quas imprimuntur, sustinebunt se mutuo. Vis Cochleæ ad  premendum corpus est ad vim manus manubrium circumagentis, ut circularis  velocitas Manubrii ea in parte ubi a manu urgetur, ad velocitatem  progressivam Cochleæ versus corpus pressum. Vires quibus cuneus urget  partes duas ligni fissi est ad vim mallei in cuneum, ut progressus cunei  secundum determinationem vis a malleo in ipsum impressæ, ad velocitatem qua  partes ligni cedunt cuneo, secundum lineas faciebus cunei perpendiculares.  Et par est ratio Machinarum omnium.    Harum efficacia & usus in eo solo consistit ut diminuendo velocitatem  augeamus vim, & contra: Unde solvitur in omni aptorum instrumentorum genere  Problema; _Datum pondus data vi movendi_, aliamve datam resistentiam vi  data superandi. Nam si Machinæ ita formentur ut velocitates Agentis &  Resistentis sint reciproce ut vires, Agens resistentiam sustinebit, &  majori cum velocitatum disparitate eandem vincet. Certe si tanta sit  velocitatum disparitas ut vincatur etiam resistentia omnis, quæ tam ex  contiguorum & inter se labentium corporum attritione, quam ex continuorum &  ab invicem separandorum cohæsione & elevandorum ponderibus oriri solet;  superata omni ea resistentia, vis redundans accelerationem motus sibi  proportionalem, partim in partibus Machinæ, partim in corpore resistente  producet. Cæterum Mechanicam tractare non est hujus instituti. Hisce volui  tantum ostendere quam late pateat, quamq; certa sit Lex tertia motus. Nam  si æstimetur Agentis actio ex ejus vi & velocitate conjunctim; &  Resistentis reactio ex ejus partium singularum velocitatibus & viribus  resistendi ab earum attritione, cohæsione, pondere & acceleratione  oriundis; erunt actio & reactio, in omni instrumentorum usu, sibi invicem  semper æquales. Et quatenus actio propagatur per instrumentum & ultimo  imprimitur in corpus omne resistens, ejus ultima determinatio  determinationi reactionis semper erit contraria.           *       *       *       *       *      DE MOTU CORPORUM           *       *       *       *       *    Liber PRIMUS           *       *       *       *       *    SECT.

Sed hoc rectangulum, eo quod latitudo ejus AB in infinitum minuitur,  sit minus quovis dato.

It bears the date March 4, 1774.[11]    In the following year he executed his first \"review of the heavens,\"  memorable chiefly as an evidence of the grand and novel conceptions  which already inspired him, and of the enthusiasm with which he  delivered himself up to their guidance. Overwhelmed with professional  engagements, he still contrived to snatch some moments for the stars;  and between the acts at the theatre was often seen running from the  harpsichord to his telescope, no doubt with that \"uncommon precipitancy  which accompanied all his actions.\"[12] He now rapidly increased the  power and perfection of his telescopes. Mirrors of seven, ten, even  twenty feet focal length, were successively completed, and unprecedented  magnifying powers employed. His energy was unceasing, his perseverance  indomitable. In the course of twenty-one years no less than 430  parabolic specula left his hands. He had entered upon his forty-second  year when he sent his first paper to the _Philosophical Transactions_;  yet during the ensuing thirty-nine years his contributions--many of them  elaborate treatises--numbered sixty-nine, forming a series of  extraordinary importance to the history of astronomy. As a mere explorer  of the heavens his labours were prodigious. He discovered 2,500 nebulae,  806 double stars, passed the whole firmament in review four several  times, counted the stars in 3,400 \"gauge-fields,\" and executed a  photometric classification of the principal stars, founded on an  elaborate (and the first systematically conducted) investigation of  their relative brightness. He was as careful and patient as he was  rapid; spared no time and omitted no precaution to secure accuracy in  his observations; yet in one night he would examine, singly and  attentively, up to 400 separate objects.    The discovery of Uranus was a mere incident of the scheme he had marked  out for himself--a fruit, gathered as it were by the way. It formed,  nevertheless, the turning-point in his career. From a star-gazing  musician he was at once transformed into an eminent astronomer; he was  relieved from the drudgery of a toilsome profession, and installed as  Royal Astronomer, with a modest salary of L200 a year; funds were  provided for the construction of the forty-foot reflector, from the  great space-penetrating power of which he expected unheard-of  revelations; in fine, his future work was not only rendered possible,  but it was stamped as authoritative.[13] On Whit-Sunday 1782, William  and Caroline Herschel played and sang in public for the last time in St.  Margaret's Chapel, Bath; in August of the same year the household was  moved to Datchet, near Windsor, and on April 3, 1786, to Slough. Here  happiness and honours crowded on the fortunate discoverer. In 1788 he  married Mary, only child of James Baldwin, a merchant of the city of  London, and widow of Mr. John Pitt--a lady whose domestic virtues were  enhanced by the possession of a large jointure. The fruit of their union  was one son, of whose work--the worthy sequel of his father's--we shall  have to speak further on. Herschel was created a Knight of the  Hanoverian Guelphic Order in 1816, and in 1821 he became the first  President of the Royal Astronomical Society, his son being its first  Foreign Secretary. But his health had now for some years been failing,  and on August 25, 1822, he died at Slough, in the eighty-fourth year of  his age, and was buried in Upton churchyard.    His epitaph claims for him the lofty praise of having \"burst the  barriers of heaven.\" Let us see in what sense this is true.    The first to form any definite idea as to the constitution of the  stellar system was Thomas Wright, the son of a carpenter living at  Byer's Green, near Durham. With him originated what has been called the  \"Grindstone Theory\" of the universe, which regarded the Milky Way as the  projection on the sphere of a stratum or disc of stars (our sun  occupying a position near the centre), similar in magnitude and  distribution to the lucid orbs of the constellations.[14] He was  followed by Kant,[15] who transcended the views of his predecessor by  assigning to nebulae the position they long continued to occupy, rather  on imaginative than scientific grounds, of \"island universes,\" external  to, and co-equal with, the Galaxy. Johann Heinrich Lambert,[16] a  tailor's apprentice from Muehlhausen, followed, but independently. The  conceptions of this remarkable man were grandiose, his intuitions bold,  his views on some points a singular anticipation of subsequent  discoveries. The sidereal world presented itself to him as a hierarchy  of systems, starting from the planetary scheme, rising to throngs of  suns within the circuit of the Milky Way--the \"ecliptic of the stars,\"  as he phrased it--expanding to include groups of many Milky Ways; these  again combining to form the unit of a higher order of assemblage, and so  onwards and upwards until the mind reels and sinks before the immensity  of the contemplated creations.    \"Thus everything revolves--the earth round the sun; the sun round the  centre of his system; this system round a centre common to it with other  systems; this group, this assemblage of systems, round a centre which is  common to it with other groups of the same kind; and where shall we have  done?\"[17]    The stupendous problem thus speculatively attempted, Herschel undertook  to grapple with experimentally. The upshot of this memorable inquiry was  the inclusion, for the first time, within the sphere of human knowledge,  of a connected body of facts, and inferences from facts, regarding the  sidereal universe; in other words, the foundation of what may properly  be called a science of the stars.    Tobias Mayer had illustrated the perspective effects which must ensue in  the stellar sphere from a translation of the solar system, by comparing  them to the separating in front and closing up behind of trees in a  forest to the eye of an advancing spectator;[18] but the appearances  which he thus correctly described he was unable to detect. By a more  searching analysis of a smaller collection of proper motions, Herschel  succeeded in rendering apparent the very consequences foreseen by Mayer.  He showed, for example, that Arcturus and Vega did, in fact, appear to  recede from, and Sirius and Aldebaran to approach, each other by very  minute amounts; and, with a striking effort of divinatory genius, placed  the \"apex,\" or point of direction of the sun's motion, close to the star  Lambda in the constellation Hercules,[19] within a few degrees of  the spot indicated by later and indefinitely more refined methods of  research. He resumed the subject in 1805,[20] but though employing a  more rigorous method, was scarcely so happy in his result. In 1806,[21]  he made a preliminary attempt to ascertain the speed of the sun's  journey, fixing it, by doubtless much too low an estimate, at about  three miles a second. Yet the validity of his general conclusion as to  the line of solar travel, though long doubted, has been triumphantly  confirmed. The question as to the \"secular parallax\" of the fixed stars  was in effect answered.    With their _annual_ parallax, however, the case was very different. The  search for it had already led Bradley to the important discoveries of  the aberration of light and the nutation of the earth's axis; it was now  about to lead Herschel to a discovery of a different, but even more  elevated character. Yet in neither case was the object primarily sought  attained.    From the very first promulgation of the Copernician theory the seeming  immobility of the stars had been urged as an argument against its truth;  for if the earth really travelled in a vast orbit round the sun, objects  in surrounding space should appear to change their positions, unless  their distances were on a scale which, to the narrow ideas of the  universe then prevailing, seemed altogether extravagant.[22] The  existence of such apparent or \"parallactic\" displacements was  accordingly regarded as the touchstone of the new views, and their  detection became an object of earnest desire to those interested in  maintaining them. Copernicus himself made the attempt; but with his  \"Triquetrum,\" a jointed wooden rule with the divisions marked in ink,  constructed by himself,[23] he was hardly able to measure angles of ten  minutes, far less fractions of a second. Galileo, a more impassioned  defender of the system, strained his ears, as it were, from Arcetri, in  his blind and sorrowful old age, for news of a discovery which two more  centuries had still to wait for. Hooke believed he had found a parallax  for the bright star in the Head of the Dragon; but was deceived. Bradley  convinced himself that such effects were too minute for his instruments  to measure. Herschel made a fresh attempt by a practically untried  method.    It is a matter of daily experience that two objects situated at  different distances seem to a beholder in motion to move relatively to  each other. This principle Galileo, in the third of his Dialogues on the  Systems of the World,[24] proposed to employ for the determination of  stellar parallax; for two stars, lying apparently close together, but in  reality separated by a great gulf of space, must shift their mutual  positions when observed from opposite points of the earth's orbit; or  rather, the remoter forms a virtually fixed point, to which the  movements of the other can be conveniently referred. By this means  complications were abolished more numerous and perplexing than Galileo  himself was aware of, and the problem was reduced to one of simple  micrometrical measurement. The \"double-star method\" was also suggested  by James Gregory in 1675, and again by Wallis in 1693;[25] Huygens  first, and afterwards Dr. Long of"]]]
