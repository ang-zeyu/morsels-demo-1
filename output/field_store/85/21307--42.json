When the grass is ripe like grain,      When the scythe is stoned again,      When the lawn is shaven clear,      Then my hole shall reappear.        I shall find him, never fear,      I shall find my grenadier;      But for all that's gone and come,      I shall find my soldier dumb.        He has lived, a little thing,      In the grassy woods of spring;      Done, if he could tell me true,      Just as I should like to do.        He has seen the starry hours      And the springing of the flowers;      And the fairy things that pass      In the forests of the grass.        In the silence he has heard      Talking bee and ladybird,      And the butterfly has flown      O'er him as he lay alone.        Not a word will he disclose,      Not a word of all he knows.      I must lay him on the shelf,      And make up the tale myself.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          AUTUMN FIRES          In the other gardens        And all up the vale,      From the autumn bonfires        See the smoke trail!        Pleasant summer over        And all the summer flowers,      The red fire blazes,        The grey smoke towers.        Sing a song of seasons!        Something bright in all!      Flowers in the summer,        Fires in the fall!    [Illustration]          THE GARDENER          The gardener does not love to talk,      He makes me keep the gravel walk;      And when he puts his tools away,      He locks the door and takes the key.        Away behind the currant row,      Where no one else but cook may go,      Far in the plots, I see him dig,      Old and serious, brown and big.        He digs the flowers, green, red, and blue,      Nor wishes to be spoken to.      He digs the flowers and cuts the hay,      And never seems to want to play.        Silly gardener! summer goes,      And winter comes with pinching toes,      When in the garden bare and brown      You must lay your barrow down.        Well now, and while the summer stays,      To profit by these garden days      O how much wiser you would be      To play at Indian wars with me!    [Illustration]          HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS          Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground      That now you smoke your pipe around.      Has seen immortal actions done      And valiant battles lost and won.        Here we had best on tip-toe tread,      While I for safety march ahead,      For this is that enchanted ground      Where all who loiter slumber sound.        Here is the sea, here is the sand,      Here is simple Shepherd's Land,      Here are the fairy hollyhocks,      And there are Ali Baba's rocks.        But yonder, see! apart and high,      Frozen Siberia lies; where I,      With Robert Bruce and William Tell,      Was bound by an enchanter's spell.          ENVOYS    [Illustration]          TO WILLIE AND HENRIETTA              If two may read aright          These rhymes of old delight          And house and garden play,      You too, my cousins, and you only, may.            You in a garden green          With me were king and queen,          Were hunter, soldier, tar,      And all the thousand things that children are.            Now in the elders' seat          We rest with quiet feet,          And from the window-bay      We watch the children, our successors, play.            \"Time was,\" the golden head          Irrevocably said;          But time which none can bind,      While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.    [Illustration]          TO MY MOTHER          You too, my mother, read my rhymes      For love of unforgotten times,      And you may chance to hear once more      The little feet along the floor.    [Illustration]          TO AUNTIE          _Chief of our aunts_--not only I,      But all your dozen of nurselings cry--      _What did the other children do?_      _And what were childhood, wanting you?_    [Illustration]    [Illustration: TO AUNTIE]    [Illustration]          TO MINNIE          The red room with the giant bed      Where none but elders laid their head;      The little room where you and I      Did for awhile together lie      And, simple suitor, I your hand      In decent marriage did demand;      The great day nursery, best of all,      With pictures pasted on the wall      And leaves upon the blind      A pleasant room wherein to wake      And hear the leafy garden shake      And rustle in the wind--      And pleasant there to lie in bed      And see the pictures overhead--      The wars about Sebastopol,      The grinning guns along the wall,      The daring escalade,      The plunging ships, the bleating sheep,      The happy children ankle-deep      And laughing as they wade;      All these are vanished clean away,      And the old manse is changed to-day;      It wears an altered face      And shields a stranger race.      The river, on from mill to mill,      Flows past our childhood's garden still;      But ah! we children never more      Shall watch it from the water-door.      Below the yew--it still is there--      Our phantom voices haunt the air      As we were still at play,      And I can hear them call and say:      \"_How far is it to Babylon?_\"        Ah, far enough, my dear,      Far, far enough from here--      Yet you have farther gone!      \"_Can I get there by candlelight?_\"      So goes the old refrain.      I do not know--perchance you might--      But only, children, hear it right,      Ah, never to return again!      The eternal dawn, beyond a doubt,      Shall break on hill and plain,      And put all stars and candles out      Ere we be young again.        To you in distant India, these      I send across the seas,      Nor count it far across.      For which of us forgets      The Indian cabinets,      The bones of antelope, the wings of albatross,      The pied and painted birds and beans,      The junks and bangles, beads and screens,      The gods and sacred bells,      And the loud-humming, twisting shells!      The level of the parlour floor      Was honest, homely, Scottish shore;      But when we climbed upon a chair,      Behold the gorgeous East was there!      Be this a fable; and behold      Me in the parlour as of old,      And Minnie just above me set      In the quaint Indian cabinet!      Smiling and kind, you grace a shelf      Too high for me to reach myself.      Reach down a hand, my dear, and take      These rhymes for old acquaintance' sake!    [Illustration]          TO MY NAME-CHILD                                       1        Some day soon this rhyming volume, if you learn with proper speed,      Little Louis Sanchez, will be given you to read.      Then shall you discover, that your name was printed down      By the English printers, long before, in London town.        In the great and busy city where the East and West are met,      All the little letters did the English printer set;      While you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play,      Foreign people thought of you in places far away.        Ay, and while you slept, a baby, over all the English lands      Other little children took the volume in their hands;      Other children questioned, in their homes across the seas:      Who was little Louis, won't you tell us, mother, please?                                       2        Now that you have spelt your lesson, lay it down and go and play,      Seeking shells and seaweed on the sands of Monterey,      Watching all the mighty whalebones, lying buried by the breeze,      Tiny sandpipers, and the huge Pacific seas.        And remember in your playing, as the sea-fog rolls to you,      Long ere you could read it, how I told you what to do;      And that while you thought of no one, nearly half the world away      Some one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          TO ANY READER          As from the house your mother sees      You playing round the garden trees,      So you may see, if you will look      Through the windows of this book,      Another child, far, far away,      And in another garden, play.      But do not think you can at all,      By knocking on the window, call      That child to hear you. He intent      Is all on his play-business bent.      He does not hear; he will not look,      Nor yet be lured out of this book.      For, long ago, the truth to say,      He has grown up and gone away,      And it is but a child of air      That lingers in the garden there.

How, when engaged in a lawsuit, you could overturn       the suit, when you were about to be cast, because you       had no witnesses.         Strep. Most readily and easily.         Soc. Tell me, pray.         Strep. Well now, I'll tell you. If, while one suit was       still pending, before mine was called on, I were to run       away and hang myself.         Soc. You talk nonsense.         Strep. By the gods, would I! For no one will bring       action against me when I am dead.         Soc. You talk nonsense. Begone; I can't teach you any       longer.         Strep. Why so? Yea, by the gods, O Socrates!         Soc. You straightaway forget whatever you learn. For       what now was the first thing you were taught? Tell me.         Strep. Come, let me see: nay, what was the first? What       was the fist? Nay, what was the thing in which we knead       our flour? Ah me! What was it?         Soc. Will you not pack off to the devil, you most       forgetful and most stupid old man?         Strep. Ah me, what then, pray will become of me,       wretched man? For I shall be utterly undone, if I do not       learn to ply the tongue. Come, O ye Clouds, give me some       good advice.         Cho. We, old man, advise you, if you have a son grown       up, to send him to learn in your stead.         Strep. Well, I have a fine, handsome son, but he is not       willing to learn. What must I do?         Cho. But do you permit him?         Strep. Yes, for he is robust in body, and in good       health, and is come of the high-plumed dames of Coesyra.       I will go for him, and if he be not willing, I will       certainly drive him from my house.         [To Socrates.]         Go in and wait for me a short time.         [Exit]         Cho. Do you perceive that you are soon to obtain the       greatest benefits through us alone of the gods? For this       man is ready to do everything that you bid him. But you,       while the man is astounded and evidently elated, having       perceived it, will quickly fleece him to the best of       your power.         [Exit Socrates]         For matters of this sort are somehow accustomed to turn       the other way.         [Enter Strepsiades and Phidippides]         Strep. By Mist, you certainly shall not stay here any       longer! But go and gnaw the columns of Megacles.         Phid. My good sir, what is the matter with you, O       father? You are not in your senses, by Olympian Jupiter!         Strep. See, see, \"Olympian Jupiter!\" What folly! To       think of your believing in Jupiter, as old as you are!         Phid. Why, pray, did you laugh at this?         Strep. Reflecting that you are a child, and have       antiquated notions. Yet, however, approach, that you may       know more; and I will tell you a thing, by learning       which you will be a man. But see that you do not teach       this to any one.         Phid. Well, what is it?         Strep. You swore now by Jupiter.         Phid. I did.         Strep. Seest thou, then, how good a thing is learning?       There is no Jupiter, O Phidippides!         Phid. Who then?         Strep. Vortex reigns, having expelled Jupiter.         Phid. Bah! Why do you talk foolishly?         Strep. Be assured that it is so.         Phid. Who says this?         Strep. Socrates the Melian, and Chaerephon, who knows       the footmarks of fleas.         Phid. Have you arrived at such a pitch of frenzy that       you believe madmen?         Strep. Speak words of good omen, and say nothing bad of       clever men and wise; of whom, through frugality, none       ever shaved or anointed himself, or went to a bath to       wash himself; while you squander my property in bathing,       as if I were already dead. But go as quickly as possible       and learn instead of me.         Phid. What good could any one learn from them?         Strep. What, really? Whatever wisdom there is among men.       And you will know yourself, how ignorant and stupid you       are. But wait for me here a short time.         [Runs off]         Phid. Ah me! What shall I do, my father being crazed?       Shall I bring him into court and convict him of lunacy,       or shall I give information of his madness to the       coffin-makers?         [Re-enter Strepsiades with a cock under one arm and a       hen under the other]         Strep. Come, let me see; what do you consider this to       be? Tell me.         Phid. Alectryon.         Strep. Right. And what this?         Phid. Alectryon.         Strep. Both the same? You are very ridiculous. Do not do       so, then, for the future; but call this alektryaina, and       this one alektor.         Phid. Alektryaina! Did you learn these clever things by       going in just now to the Titans?         Strep. And many others too; but whatever I learned on       each occasion I used to forget immediately, through       length of years.         Phid. Is it for this reason, pray, that you have also       lost your cloak?         Strep. I have not lost it; but have studied it away.         Phid. What have you made of your slippers, you foolish       man?         Strep. I have expended them, like Pericles, for needful       purposes.  Come, move, let us go. And then if you obey       your father, go wrong if you like. I also know that I       formerly obeyed you, a lisping child of six years old,       and bought you a go-cart at the Diasia, with the first       obolus I received from the Heliaea.         Phid. You will assuredly some time at length be grieved       at this.         Strep. It is well done of you that you obeyed. Come       hither, come hither O Socrates! Come forth, for I bring       to you this son of mine, having persuaded him against       his will.         [Enter Socrates]         Soc. For he is still childish, and not used to the       baskets here.         Phid. You would yourself be used to them if you were       hanged.         Strep. A mischief take you! Do you abuse your teacher?         Soc. \"Were hanged\" quoth 'a! How sillily he pronounced       it, and with lips wide apart! How can this youth ever       learn an acquittal from a trial or a legal summons, or       persuasive refutation? And yet Hyperbolus learned this       at the cost of a talent.         Strep. Never mind; teach him. He is clever by nature.       Indeed, from his earliest years, when he was a little       fellow only so big, he was wont to form houses and carve       ships within-doors, and make little wagons of leather,       and make frogs out of pomegranate-rinds, you can't think       how cleverly. But see that he learns those two causes;       the better, whatever it may be; and the worse, which, by       maintaining what is unjust, overturns the better. If not       both, at any rate the unjust one by all means.         Soc. He shall learn it himself from the two causes in       person.         [Exit Socrates]         Strep. I will take my departure. Remember this now, that       he is to be able to reply to all just arguments.         [Exit Strepsiades and enter Just Cause and Unjust Cause]         Just Cause. Come hither! Show yourself to the       spectators, although being audacious.         Unjust Cause. Go whither you please; for I shall far       rather do for you, if I speak before a crowd.         Just. You destroy me? Who are you?         Unj. A cause.         Just. Ay, the worse.         Unj. But I conquer you, who say that you are better than       I.         Just. By doing what clever trick?         Unj. By discovering new contrivances.         Just. For these innovations flourish by the favour of       these silly persons.         Unj. No; but wise persons.         Just I will destroy you miserably.         Unj. Tell me, by doing what?         Just By speaking what is just.         Unj. But I will overturn them by contradicting them; for       I deny that justice even exists at all.         Just Do you deny that it exists?         Unj. For come, where is it?         Just With the gods.         Unj. How, then, if justice exists, has Jupiter not       perished, who bound his own father?         Just Bah! This profanity now is spreading! Give me a       basin.         Unj. You are a dotard and absurd.         Just You are debauched and shameless.         Unj. You have spoken roses of me.         Just And a dirty lickspittle.         Unj. You crown me with lilies.         Just And a parricide.         Unj. You don't know that you are sprinkling me with       gold.         Just Certainly not so formerly, but with lead.         Unj. But now this is an ornament to me.         Just You are very impudent.         Unj. And you are antiquated.         Just And through you, no one of our youths is willing to       go to school; and you will be found out some time or       other by the Athenians, what sort of doctrines you teach       the simple-minded.         Unj. You are shamefully squalid.         Just And you are prosperous. And yet formerly you were a       beggar saying that you were the Mysian Telephus,  and       gnawing the maxims of Pandeletus out of your little       wallet.         Unj. Oh, the wisdom--         Just Oh, the madness--         Unj. Which you have mentioned.         Just And of your city, which supports you who ruin her       youths.         Unj. You shan't teach this youth, you old dotard.         Just Yes, if he is to be saved, and not merely to       practise loquacity.         Unj. (to Phidippides) Come hither, and leave him to       rave.         Just You shall howl, if you lay your hand on him.         Cho. Cease from contention and railing. But show to us,       you, what you used to teach the men of former times, and       you, the new system of education; in order that, having       heard you disputing, he may decide and go to the school       of one or the other.
