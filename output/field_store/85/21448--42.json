From May to August, it is gorged with the  fledglings of the nest. It is fortunate that its range is so limited.  In size it is smaller than the common crow, and is a much less noble  and dignified bird. Its caw is weak and feminine--a sort of split and  abortive caw, that stamps it the sneak-thief it is. This crow is  common farther south, but is not found in this State, so far as I have  observed, except in the valley of the Hudson.    One season a pair of them built a nest in a Norway Spruce that stood  amid a dense growth of other ornamental trees near a large unoccupied  house. They sat down amid plenty. The wolf established himself in the  fold. The many birds--robins, thrushes, finches, vireos, pewees--that  seek the vicinity of dwellings (especially of these large country  residences with their many trees and park-like grounds), for the greater  safety of their eggs and young, were the easy and convenient victims  of these robbers. They plundered right and left, and were not disturbed  till their young were nearly fledged, when some boys, who had long  before marked them as their prize, rifled the nest.    The song-birds nearly all build low; their cradle is not upon the  tree-top. It is only birds of prey that fear danger from below more than  from above, and that seek the higher branches for their nests. A line  five feet from the ground would run above more than half the nests, and  one ten feet would bound more than three fourths of them. It is only  the oriole and the wood pewee that, as a rule, go higher than this. The  crows and jays and other enemies of the birds have learned to explore  this belt pretty thoroughly. But the leaves and the protective coloring  of most nests baffle them as effectually, no doubt as they do the  professional ooelogist. The nest of the red-eyed vireo is one of the most  artfully placed in the wood. It is just beyond the point where the eye  naturally pauses in its search; namely, on the extreme end of the lowest  branch of the tree, usually four or five feet from the ground. One looks  up and down through the tree,--shoots his eye-beams into it as he might  discharge his gun at some game hidden there, but the drooping tip of  that low horizontal branch--who would think of pointing his piece just  there? If a crow or other marauder were to alight upon the branch or  upon those above it, the nest would be screened from him by the large  leaf that usually forms a canopy immediately above it. The nest-hunter  standing at the foot of the tree and looking straight before him, might  discover it easily, were it not for its soft, neutral gray tint which  blends so thoroughly with the trunks and branches of trees. Indeed,  I think there is no nest in the woods--no arboreal nest--so well  concealed. The last one I saw was a pendent from the end of a low branch  of a maple, that nearly grazed the clapboards of an unused hay-barn in  a remote backwoods clearing. I peeped through a crack and saw the old  birds feed the nearly fledged young within a few inches of my face. And  yet the cow-bird finds this nest and drops her parasitical egg in  it. Her tactics in this as in other cases are probably to watch the  movements of the parent bird. She may often be seen searching anxiously  through the trees or bushes for a suitable nest, yet she may still  oftener be seen perched upon some good point of observation watching  the birds as they come and go about her. There is no doubt that, in many  cases, the cow-bird makes room for her own illegitimate egg in the nest  by removing one of the bird's own. When the cow-bird finds two or more  eggs in a nest in which she wishes to deposit her own, she will remove  one of them. I found a sparrow's nest with two sparrow's eggs and one  cow-bird's egg, another egg lying a foot or so below it on the ground.  I replaced the ejected egg, and the next day found it again removed, and  another cow-bird's egg in its place; I put it back the second time, when  it was again ejected, or destroyed, for I failed to find it anywhere.  Very alert and sensitive birds like the warblers often bury the strange  egg beneath a second nest built on top of the old. A lady, living in the  suburbs of an eastern city, one morning heard cries of distress from a  pair of house-wrens that had a nest in a honeysuckle on her front porch.  On looking out of the window, she beheld this little comedy--comedy from  her point of view, but no doubt grim-tragedy from the point of view  of the wrens; a cow-bird with a wren's egg in its beak running rapidly  along the walk with the outraged wrens forming a procession behind it,  screaming, scolding, and gesticulating as only these voluble little  birds can. The cow-bird had probably been surprised in the act of  violating the nest, and the wrens were giving her a piece of theirs  minds.    Every cow-bird is reared at the expense of two or more song-birds.  For every one of these dusky little pedestrians there amid the grazing  cattle there are two more sparrows, or vireos, or warblers, the less.  It is a big price to pay--two larks for a bunting-two sovereigns for  a shilling; but Nature does not hesitate occasionally to  contradict herself in just this way. The young of the cow-bird is  disproportionately large and aggressive, one might say hoggish.  When disturbed it will clasp the nest and scream, and snap its beak  threateningly. One hatched out in a song-sparrow's nest which was under  my observation, and would soon have overridden and overborne the young  sparrow, which came out of the shell a few hours later, had I not  interfered from time to time and lent the young sparrow a helping hand.  Every day I would visit the nest and take the sparrow out from under the  pot-bellied interloper and place it on top so that presently it was able  to hold its own against its enemy. Both birds became fledged and left  the nest about the same time. Whether the race was an even one after  that, I know not.    I noted but two warblers' nests during that season, one of the  black-throated blue-back and one of the redstart,--the latter built in  an apple-tree but a few yards from a little rustic summer-house where  I idle away many summer days. The lively little birds, darting and  flashing about, attracted my attention for a week before I discovered  their nest. They probably built it by working early in the morning,  before I appeared upon the scene, as I never saw them with material in  their beaks. Guessing from their movements that the nest was in a large  maple that stood near by, I climbed the tree and explored it thoroughly,  looking especially in the forks of the branches, as the authorities say  these birds build in a fork. But no nest could I find. Indeed, how can  one by searching find a bird's nest? I overshot the mark; the nest was  much nearer me, almost under my very nose, and I discovered it, not by  searching but by a casual glance of the eye, while thinking of other  matters. The bird was just settling upon it as I looked up from my book  and caught her in the act. The nest was built near the end of a long,  knotty, horizontal branch of an apple-tree, but effectually hidden by  the grouping of the leaves; it had three eggs, one of which proved to be  barren. The two young birds grew apace, and were out of the nest early  in the second week; but something caught one of them the first night.  The other probably grew to maturity, as it disappeared from the vicinity  with its parents after some days.    The blue-back's nest was scarcely a foot from the ground, in a little  bush situated in a low, dense wood of hemlock and beech and maple,  amid the Catskills,--a deep, massive, elaborate structure, in which the  sitting bird sank till her beak and tail alone were visible above the  brim. It was a misty, chilly day when I chanced to find the nest, and  the mother-bird knew instinctively that it was not prudent to leave her  four half incubated eggs uncovered and exposed for a moment. When I sat  down near the nest she grew very uneasy, and after trying in vain  to decoy me away by suddenly dropping from the branches and dragging  herself over the ground as if mortally wounded, she approached and  timidly and half doubtingly covered her eggs within two yards of where  I sat. I disturbed her several times to note her ways. There came to be  something almost appealing in her looks and manner, and she would keep  her place on her precious eggs till my outstretched hand was within a  few feet of her. Finally, I covered the cavity of the nest with a dry  leaf. This she did not remove with her beak, but thrust her head deftly  beneath it and shook it off upon the ground. Many of her sympathizing  neighbors, attracted by her alarm note, came and had a peep at the  intruder and then flew away, but the male bird did not appear upon the  scene. The final history of this nest I am unable to give, as I did not  again visit it till late in the season, when, of course, it was empty.    Years pass without my finding a brown-thrasher's nest; it is not a nest  you are likely to stumble upon in your walk; it is hidden as a miser  hides his gold, and watched as jealously. The male pours out his rich  and triumphant song from the tallest tree he can find, and fairly  challenges you to come and look for his treasures in his vicinity. But  you will not find them if you go. The nest is somewhere on the outer  circle of his song; he is never so imprudent as to take up his stand  very near it. The artists who draw those cosy little pictures of a  brooding mother-bird with the male perched but a yard away in full song,  do not copy from nature. The thrasher's nest I found thirty or forty  rods from the point where the male was wont to indulge in his brilliant  recitative. It was in an open field under a low ground-juniper. My dog  disturbed the sitting bird as I was passing near.

It will be noticed that the rods are placed beneath the  notches of odd numbers. In knotting warp strings in pairs it will be  found necessary, when the last tooth is reached, to do one of two  things--either allow one string to lie beyond the rod, or, having strung  the warp within one tooth of the rod, to start the next string in the  _same_ notch, bringing the two strings together. This will bring one  string on top of the rod and none beyond. In the first case, the string  beyond the rod must be taken up in weaving with the one on top of the  rod. Experience has proved the second method to be the better one.    [Sidenote: _Double warp for Turkish rugs, etc., with fringe_]    Kiz-Kilim rugs have perforated or open-work patterns. To produce this  effect string a _double_ warp through every notch in the foot and head  pieces; that is, use two strings in each notch, tying in pairs for  fringe as before. Use a brownish white carpet thread. With strong black  thread string through every other notch to outline perpendicular sides  of squares in the pattern. Your warp will be strung three-sixteenths  inch, but the black threads will be three-eighths inch. This will enable  you to keep the patterns straight as the work progresses.    [Illustration: _A Kiz-Kilim rug pattern_]    [Sidenote: _Patterns for Turkish rugs_]    In drawing designs for Turkish rugs, where the pattern is to be placed  under the warp, it is better to make a squared paper first. Lay the head  piece of the loom upon unlined paper. Place a dot at every other notch.  Draw perpendicular lines first, then dot for horizontal lines. The  result will be a foundation to fit your loom. If the squared paper of  the kindergarten be used the squares will be either too large or too  small to correspond with the notches in the loom. It will be found very  easy to transfer a pattern from a rug to the paper. Fasten the pattern  under the warp by overhanding to the rods, taking care to have the black  strings directly over the perpendicular lines in the pattern.    [Sidenote: _Patterns for Navajo blankets_]    Patterns for Navajo blankets are usually triangular. Draw on unlined  paper and fasten under the warp as before.    [Sidenote: _To string a continuous warp for long strips_]    Rugs and similar articles may be made of any length by stringing a  continuous warp. After the length has been decided upon, cut the warp  strings _twice_ as long. Place the middle of one string around the first  tooth of the foot piece (or two or three, according to the width of warp  desired) and bring up the two ends firmly to the first tooth in the head  piece. Knot securely and let the long ends extend beyond the head piece.  If desired they can be wound on spools, or around the tops of the rods,  to prevent tangling. Continue until all the warp is strung. Observe the  instructions given before for stringing warp strings in pairs. It is not  necessary to weave the loom full each time, as the last inch is very  slow work, but when the weaving is near the head piece draw out the  rods, lift it from the notches, pass it down to the foot piece so that  the part which was at the head is now at the foot, untie the knots so  that the work will lie close to the foot piece and knot the warp strings  as before at the head piece. This can be done as many times as desired.    [Sidenote: _Methods of fastening long strips together_]    For afghans, slumber robes, couch covers, etc., crochet with plain  stitch or baste on oil-cloth and weave together with tape needle, making  it as nearly like the original weaving as possible. By studying Turkish  rugs and curtains one can learn how to put strips together with a fancy  stitch somewhat like our feather stitch.    Strips for floor rugs should be basted on oil-cloth and the warp strings  in the two edges caught together at intervals, running the connecting  thread _through_ the loops so as to be invisible. Finish the outside  edges by stitching on a tape of the same color, by machine.    [Sidenote: _Table covers, afghans, slumber robes, or large rugs_]    By making several of these long strips and fastening them together one  can have a table cover, afghan, slumber robe, or a large rug.    [Sidenote: _Floor rugs_]    The floor rug shown in the illustration on page 100 (1-1/4 yards by 3/4  yard) is woven in strips with a continuous warp. The center strip is  one yard long and nine inches wide. It is made of deep cardinal carpet  wool. The strips of black, nine inches wide at the sides and ends,  terminate diagonally, as seen in the illustration. The black diagonal  lines show where the weaving ends. The warp is then tied and cut close  to the weaving. The strips are to be sewn or crocheted together.    [Sidenote: _Fine weaving_]    [Sidenote: _To produce a design with the woof_]    For very fine weaving, where it is necessary for the warp threads to  _touch_ each other in order to produce a design with the woof, string a  _double_ warp in every notch with the same material. Then, with a tape  needle, separate the warp threads, twist one over the other so that all  will lie side by side, and secure them by weaving a few times across the  loom. By using this method, one can have a close warp on the wooden  looms.    [Sidenote: _Warp for doll towels_]    In stringing warp in pairs for doll towels, have two strings on each bar  and one extending one notch beyond at each side. This makes a good  fringe for the edges of the towel.          Chapter Five    MATERIALS      [Sidenote: _Silkoline_]    Plain and figured silkoline should be cut in bias strips one-half inch  wide. Stretch and pull through the hands until both edges are raveled.  When these strips are woven, the rug or mat will be reversible. Figured  silkolines give a pretty mottled effect, especially those in which  Turkish colors predominate. Rugs having plain centers and mottled  borders are beautiful. A full-sized rug requires nearly two yards of  material.    [Sidenote: _Cheese cloth_]    Strips of cheese cloth can be prepared in the same way. Cut them  three-fourths inch wide on account of the tendency to ravel. Serviceable  face and dish cloths can be made of white cheese cloth. Some of the  colored cheese cloths make pretty rugs. When a desirable color cannot be  found, the white cloth can be dyed at home.    [Sidenote: _Dress linings_]    Soft dress linings come in many beautiful colors. Old pieces may be  utilized by cleaning and dyeing. The pieces are cut in bias strips,  one-half inch in width.    [Sidenote: _Silk_]    Pieces of old silk can also be prepared in this way. One can often  obtain new pieces at dressmaking establishments.    [Sidenote: _Candle-wicking_]    Table mats, wash cloths, and similar articles can be made from  candle-wicking. For lamp mats, cushion covers, and other articles the  material may be dyed and woven in two colors, or in two tones of one  color. A number of squares can be joined to make a hammock pillow. By  stringing a close warp with white or colored wicking and weaving over  and under one string with the same material, a coarse canvas can be  made, upon which the children can cross-stitch a pretty border and  center piece, or an all-over pattern by copying the kindergarten  designs, or even initials and monograms. Most of the canvas sold at the  stores, even the old Java canvas of our childhood days, is too fine for  little children to work upon. In canvas made of candle-wicking by the  child himself, the squares are large, and to this there is the added  pleasure of the child being able to say when the work is finished, \"I  did it all myself.\"    [Sidenote: _Rope silk, or ropetine_]    Beautiful silk canvas can be made of rope silk and cross-stitched with  another color or tone, or with chenille, making a velvet figure. This  material is, of course, more expensive. Two colors or two tones may be  woven with chenille and silk in a kindergarten design. Beautiful holiday  and birthday gifts can be made from these materials, such as mats,  cushion covers, and sachet cases. Glove, mouchoir, necktie, fan, and  trinket boxes can be made by weaving the top, bottom, and sides in  panels. Foundation boxes, which may be purchased for a few cents, are  excellent for this purpose, or they can be made very well at home from  three-ply cardboard. Make the hinges of ribbon and line the boxes with  silk of a corresponding or contrasting color.    [Sidenote: _Carpet ravelings_]    Carpet ravelings may be obtained from the carpet stores, or pieces of  carpet can be raveled by the children. Let them have the pleasure and  benefit which come from sorting the ravelings. It is an excellent lesson  in color, besides developing the patience, concentration,  discrimination, and judgment so much to be desired in other work. After  the wool is sorted--not before, because it is not all fast color--dip in  water, wring, and let the children straighten it gently, one piece at a  time. This will make it as smooth and soft as new wool. Procure some  small boxes--shoe boxes are a good size--place one color in a box with a  sample fastened outside at one end, and pile them upon a low shelf or  window sill. Train the children to go to the \"play store\" to match their  own wool. If they go quietly, one at a time, no one is disturbed and  each child gains in knowledge of color as well as in independence. A  little management of this kind helps the teacher as well as the child.    [Sidenote: _Carpet wools_]    New wools of various kinds and beautiful colors can be bought in large  quantities from dealers in materials for industrial work. In some carpet  departments you will find oriental wools which are used to mend rugs,  and a small quantity can be bought. Some of the kindergarten supply  stores and decoration companies have already advertised a stock of these  materials.
