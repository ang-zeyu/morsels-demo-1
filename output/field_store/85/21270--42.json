[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#6)"],[1,"is a most unlucky  thing to meet when it is empty.  Peppino says--    \"If you shall meet the carriage of the dead man and it is empty, perhaps  it shall be coming to take you; this is not a good thing and then must  you be holding the horn in the hand.  But if the dead man shall be riding  in his carriage, then certainly this time it shall not be for you and the  horn it is necessary not at all.  This is what they believe.\"    He did not mean that you are bound to die if you see an empty hearse, but  that unless you take precautions you will certainly meet with some kind  of misfortune.  I should say that the professor meets an empty hearse  every day of his life.  He came up to Castellinaria, not knowing there  was to be a festa, found every place full and spent the night wandering  about the streets.  It was impossible not to be sorry for the poor man  when I found him the following afternoon dozing on a chair in the kitchen  and, in a fit of expansiveness, I offered him the other bed in my room.  He accepted it with gratitude and said he should retire early as he was  too much fatigued to care about religious festivities.    Peppino took the earliest opportunity of blowing me up for this, saying  that it was most dangerous to sleep with a jettatore in the room.  I told  him I did not believe in all that nonsense any more than he did and we  had a long discussion which he ended by producing a coral horn from his  pocket, saying the professor might have the other bed if I would wear the  coral all night.  Of course I chaffed him about having the horn in his  pocket after his protestations of disbelief, but it was like talking to a  kitten that has been caught stealing fish and I had to take his charm and  promise to conform on the ground that one cannot be too careful.    The procession, which was the climax of the festa, did not begin till  11.30 P.M. and was not over till 3.30 the next morning.  On returning to  the albergo I found the professor still dozing on his chair, undisturbed  by the constant chatter of all the servants and their friends.  He had  not gone to bed because the padrone, Peppino's father, with the key of my  room in his pocket, had gone out early in the evening and got lost in the  crowd, so there were both my beds wasted and nothing to be done but to  make the best of it.  I settled myself on a chair in a corner and wished  for day.  Whereupon, almost immediately, Peppino, who, though I did not  know it till afterwards, had been keeping near me and watching me all  night in case I might meet the evil eye among the people, came in and the  discussion rose into a tumult of dialect, as the situation was made clear  to him, and then sank into complete silence which was broken by his  suddenly saying to me--    \"You wish to sleep?  All right.  I show you the bed.  Come on.\"    He preceded me up some back stairs into a room occupied by a lady in one  bed, her female attendant in another and, in various shakedowns on the  floor, another woman, two men and more children than I could count by the  light of one candle.  We picked our way among them to the farther end of  the room where there was a door.  Peppino produced a key and opened it;  to my surprise it led into my room.    \"Buon riposo,\" said Peppino, and was about to disappear the way we had  come when I reminded him that the professor was to have the other bed.  I  had some difficulty with him, but when I had hung his coral round my neck  he gave way.    After this I saw a great deal of the professor.  He said he was  forty-five and he was perhaps the most simple-minded, gentle creature I  have ever known.  Being with him was like listening to a child strumming  on a worn-out piano.  As we sat down to dinner next day he asked if he  could have a little carbonate of soda.  Peppino, with a glance at the  bill of fare, regretted that there was none in the house.  The professor  then explained to me the advantages of taking carbonate of soda before  meals and said that some chemists gave one an enormous quantity for two  soldi.  Evidently the professor had not a good digestion.  He helped me  with his own fork to a piece of meat off his own plate.  This is a mark  of very great friendliness and makes me think of Joseph entertaining his  brethren when they went down to buy corn in Egypt.    \"And he took and sent messes unto them from before him; but Benjamin's  mess was five times so much as any of theirs.\"    And I think of Menelaus in the _Odyssey_ sending a piece of meat to  Telemachus and Pisistratus when they supped with him at Lacedaemon; and  of Ulysses, at supper in the palace of Alcinous, sending a piece of meat  to Demodocus to thank him for his singing, in spite of the pain his lays  had caused him.    I always accept the gift, after deprecating the honour with words and  gestures, and a little later, in accordance with what I believe to be the  modern practice, return the compliment.    The professor was pleased to have an opportunity of improving his  knowledge of England and asked me many questions.  I am afraid he only  pretended to believe some of the things I told him.  I said that in  England a man who is the proprietor of the house he lives in is not on  that account necessarily a rich man; he may or may not be, it all  depends.  He was surprised to hear that I had travelled from London to  Castellinaria in less than three weeks; that the channel passage takes  under twelve hours and has been known to be smooth; that London is not  actually on the coast but a few miles inland and on a river; that we have  other towns even more inland and that after the death of Queen Victoria,  England did not become a republic.    I had the professor at a disadvantage because, being a Sicilian, his  natural politeness would not permit him to show that in his opinion I was  drawing upon my imagination after the manner of travellers.  Moreover  Peppino declared that all I said was quite true and added that what in  Sicily is like this (holding his hand out with the palm upwards) in  England is like that (holding it with the palm downwards).  Nevertheless  I was beginning to feel that I had gone far enough and had better be  careful, so when he asserted that England refuses Home Rule to New  Zealand, and grinds her colonies down under the iron heel of the  oppressor because she cannot afford to lose the amount they pay us in our  iniquitous income tax, I did not contradict him.  It is possible that I  misunderstood him, or he may have guessed I did not agree, or there may  have been even more confusion in his mind than I suspected, for he  afterwards said that the income tax paid by the colonies went into the  private pocket of Mr. Chamberlain, and that explained why the Secretary  for the Colonies was so rich.    \"My dear professor,\" I said, \"permit me to tell you something; my poor  mother had a cousin whose name was James.  He was perhaps the most  simple-minded, gentle creature I have ever known.  Being with him was  like listening to--well, it was like listening to certain kinds of music.  He lived by himself in the country, with an old woman to do for him, and  was over sixty before we came to know him; then we were all very fond of  him and often wondered what the dear, good old gentleman could have been  like in his early days.  It has just occurred to me that you, sir, are  like what cousin James must have been at your age.\"    He was overwhelmed; his eyes filled with tears; he said he should  remember for all his life the flattering words he had just heard; they  constituted the most pleasing and genteel compliment he had ever  received; he shook hands with me and remained silent as a sign that his  emotion was too deep for more words.        CHAPTER IV--THE WINE-SHIP      Peppino usually took half an hour off and came about noon to wherever I  was sketching to fetch me to lunch.  One morning as we walked along  nearly every man we met smiled and said to him--    \"Buona festa, Peppino,\" and he smiled and returned their salutes with the  same words.  He accounted for it by saying it was his onomastico--the day  of the saint whose name he bears.    \"What?\" said I, \"is it S. Peppino and you never told me?  I wish you many  happy returns of the day.  But it cannot be everybody's onomastico as  well, and you say 'Buona festa, Peppino' to all who speak to you.\"    He replied that it was the 19th of March, the festa of S. Giuseppe, and  assured me that he had said \"Buona festa, Peppino\" to no one who was not  a namesake; so that about two-thirds of the men at Castellinaria must  have been baptized Giuseppe.    \"Then that explains it,\" said I.  \"I was beginning to think that you  might have become engaged to be married and they were congratulating  you.\"    That did not do at all.    \"I got no time to be married,\" said he, \"too much busy.  Besides,  marriage very bad thing.  Look here, I shall tell you, listen to me.  Marriage is good for the woman, is bad for the man: every marriage makes  to be one woman more in the world, one man less.  Did you understand?  And they are not happy together.  We have a bad example in this town.\"    \"Surely you don't mean to tell me that here in Castellinaria, where  everything moves so smoothly and so peacefully, you have an unhappy  married couple?\"    He replied solemnly, slowly and decidedly, \"Not one--all.\"    He continued in his usual manner, \"Did you read the ten commandments for  the people who shall be married?  If to find, shall be showing you.  It  says, 'Non quarelate la prima volta.'  Did you understand?  'Don't begin  to quarrel,' because you will never stop.  After the quarrel you make the  peace, but it is too late: the man shall forget, perhaps, but the woman  shall forget never, never, never, and you have lost.    \"I was telling to my friend,\" he continued, \"'Please do not be married,  because when you would be married you would not love any more that lady.'  And he was telling to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24654"],[0,"Chaldea: From the Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria (#6)"],[1," place of  doorways leading into other rooms, with sculptured slabs similar to the  one first discovered, and representing scenes of battles, sieges and the  like. He walked as in a dream. It was a new and wonderful world suddenly  opened. For these sculptures evidently recorded the deeds of the  builder, some powerful conqueror and king. And those long and close  lines engraved in the stone, all along the slabs, in the same peculiar  character as the short inscriptions on the bricks that lay scattered on  the plain--they must surely contain the text to these sculptured  illustrations. But who is to read them? They are not like any known  writing in the world and may remain a sealed book forever. Who, then,  was the builder? To what age belong these structures? Which of the wars  we read about are here portrayed? None of these questions, which must  have strangely agitated him, could Mr. Botta have answered at the time.  But not the less to him remains the glory of having, first of living  men, entered the palace of an Assyrian king.    18. Mr. Botta henceforth devoted himself exclusively to the mound of  Khorsabad. His discovery created an immense sensation in Europe.  Scholarly indifference was not proof against so unlooked-for a shock;  the revulsion was complete and the spirit of research and enterprise was  effectually aroused, not to slumber again. The French consul was  supplied by his government with ample means to carry on excavations on a  large scale. If the first success may be considered as merely a great  piece of good fortune, the following ones were certainly due to  intelligent, untiring labor and ingenuous scholarship. We see the  results in Botta's voluminous work \"Monuments de Ninive\"[B] and in the  fine Assyrian collection of the Louvre, in the first room of which is  placed, as is but just, the portrait of the man to whose efforts and  devotion it is due.    19. The great English investigator Layard, then a young and enthusiastic  scholar on his Eastern travels, passing through Mosul in 1842, found Mr.  Botta engaged on his first and unpromising attempts at Koyunjik, and  subsequently wrote to him from Constantinople exhorting him to persist  and not give up his hopes of success. He was one of the first to hear of  the astounding news from Khorsabad, and immediately determined to carry  out a long-cherished project of his own, that of exploring a large mound  known among the Arabs under the name of NIMRUD, and situated somewhat  lower on the Tigris, near that river's junction with one of its chief  tributaries, the Zab. The difficulty lay in procuring the necessary  funds. Neither the trustees of the British Museum nor the English  Government were at first willing to incur such considerable expense on  what was still looked upon as very uncertain chances. It was a private  gentleman, Sir Stratford Canning, then English minister at  Constantinople, who generously came forward, and announced himself  willing to meet the outlay within certain limits, while authorities at  home were to be solicited and worked upon. So Mr. Layard was enabled to  begin operations on the mound which he had specially selected for  himself in the autumn of 1845, the year after that in which the building  of Khorsabad was finally laid open by Botta. The results of his  expedition were so startlingly vast and important, and the particulars  of his work on the Assyrian plains are so interesting and picturesque,  that they will furnish ample materials for a separate chapter.

LAYARD AND HIS WORK.      1. In the first part of November, 1845, we find the enthusiastic and  enterprising young scholar on the scene of his future exertions and  triumphs. His first night in the wilderness, in a ruinous Arab village  amidst the smaller mounds of Nimrud, is vividly described by him:--\"I  slept little during the night. The hovel in which we had taken shelter,  and its inmates, did not invite slumber; but such scenes and companions  were not new to me; they could have been forgotten, had my brain been  less excited. Hopes, long-cherished, were now to be realized, or were to  end in disappointment. Visions of palaces underground, of gigantic  monsters, of sculptured figures, and endless inscriptions floated before  me. After forming plan after plan for removing the earth, and  extricating these treasures, I fancied myself wandering in a maze of  chambers from which I could find no outlet. Then again, all was  reburied, and I was standing on the grass-covered mound.\"    2. Although not doomed to disappointment in the end, these hopes were  yet to be thwarted in many ways before the visions of that night became  reality. For many and various were the difficulties which Layard had to  contend with during the following months as well as during his second  expedition in 1848. The material hardships of perpetual camping out in  an uncongenial climate, without any of the simplest conveniences of  life, and the fevers and sickness repeatedly brought on by exposure to  winter rains and summer heat, should perhaps be counted among the least  of them, for they had their compensations. Not so the ignorant and  ill-natured opposition, open or covert, of the Turkish authorities. That  was an evil to which no amount of philosophy could ever fully reconcile  him. His experiences in that line form an amusing collection. Luckily,  the first was also the worst. The pasha whom he found installed at Mosul  was, in appearance and temper, more like an ogre than a man. He was the  terror of the country. His cruelty and rapacity knew no bounds. When he  sent his tax-collectors on their dreaded round, he used to dismiss them  with this short and pithy instruction: \"Go, destroy, eat!\" (i.e.  \"plunder\"), and for his own profit had revived several kinds of  contributions which had been suffered to fall into disuse, especially  one called \"tooth-money,\"--\"a compensation in money, levied upon all  villages in which a man of such rank is entertained, for the wear and  tear of his teeth in masticating the food he condescends to receive from  the inhabitants.\"    3. The letters with which Layard was provided secured him a gracious  reception from this amiable personage, who allowed him to begin  operations on the great mound of Nimrud with the party of Arab workmen  whom he had hired for the purpose. Some time after, it came to the  Pasha's knowledge that a few fragments of gold leaf had been found in  the rubbish and he even procured a small particle as sample. He  immediately concluded, as the Arab chief had done, that the English  traveller was digging for hidden treasure--an object far more  intelligible to them than that of disinterring and carrying home a  quantity of old broken stones. This incident, by arousing the great  man's rapacity, might have caused him to put a stop to all further  search, had not Layard, who well knew that treasure of this kind was not  likely to be plentiful in the ruins, immediately proposed that his  Excellency should keep an agent at the mound, to take charge of all the  precious metals which might be discovered there in the course of the  excavations. The Pasha raised no objections at the moment, but a few  days later announced to Layard that, to his great regret, he felt it his  duty to forbid the continuation of the work, since he had just learned  that the diggers were disturbing a Mussulman burying-ground. As the  tombs of true believers are held very sacred and inviolable by  Mohammedans, this would have been a fatal obstacle, had not one of the  Pasha's own officers confidentially disclosed to Layard that the tombs  were _sham ones_, that he and his men had been secretly employed to  fabricate them, and for two nights had been bringing stones for the  purpose from the surrounding villages. \"We have destroyed more tombs of  true believers,\" said the Aga,--(officer)--\"in making sham ones, than  ever you could have defiled. We have killed our horses and ourselves in  carrying those accursed stones.\" Fortunately the Pasha, whose misdeeds  could not be tolerated even by a Turkish government, was recalled about  Christmas, and succeeded by an official of an entirely different stamp,  a man whose reputation for justice and mildness had preceded him, and  whose arrival was accordingly greeted with public rejoicings. Operations  at the mound now proceeded for some time rapidly and successfully. But  this very success at one time raised new difficulties for our explorers.    4. One day, as Layard was returning to the mound from an excursion, he  was met on the way by two Arabs who had ridden out to meet him at full  speed, and from a distance shouted to him in the wildest excitement:  \"Hasten, O Bey! hasten to the diggers! for they have found Nimrod  himself. It is wonderful, but it is true! we have seen him with our  eyes. There is no God but God!\" Greatly puzzled, he hurried on and,  descending into the trench, found that the workmen had uncovered a  gigantic head, the body to which was still imbedded in earth and  rubbish. This head, beautifully sculptured in the alabaster furnished by  the neighboring hills, surpassed in height the tallest man present. The  great shapely features, in their majestic repose, seemed to guard some  mighty secret and to defy the bustling curiosity of those who gazed on  them in wonder and fear. \"One of the workmen, on catching the first  glimpse of the monster, had thrown down his basket and run off toward  Mossul as fast as his legs could carry him.\"    [Illustration: 2.--TEMPLE OF EA AT ERIDHU (ABU-SHAHREIN).
