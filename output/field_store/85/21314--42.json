My left arm aches now as  I think of it.    \"As I was one day gambolling with another playfellow in a large tree,  with great branches standing out from the trunk, and at a good height  from the ground, my companion, another young gorilla, but with smaller  mouth, larger nose, and other features uglier than mine, suddenly  shrieked, and looked frightened and angry. No sooner had I noticed him  than my whole frame was shaken. I was seized by two paws in the small of  my back--a very painful part to be dug into--by ten hooked claws, nearly  as long as tenpenny nails, but horribly sharp and hooked.--Oh my arm!    \"I tried to turn round, and there was a most ferocious leopard growling  at me. I tried to bite, and to scratch his eyes out, but the pain in the  small of my back made me quite giddy. The spotted scoundrel seized my  left arm--how it aches!--and gave me a _crunch_ or two. I hear, I feel  the teeth against my bones as I write. My whole body is full of pain.    \"My mother came and released me. She was large, handsome, and  well-to-do, with _such_ long and strong arms, and with a magnificent  bulging and pouting mouth. In those days of my infancy I used to fancy I  should like to try to take as large a bite of a plantain as she could. I  tried twice or thrice, but could only squash a tenth of the juice of the  fruit into my mouth. She had glorious white teeth. Her grin clearly  frightened the leopard, as well as a pinch she gave him in the 'scruff'  of the neck with one of her hands, while with the other she caught hold  of his tail and made him yell. How he roared! He fell off the branch on  to another; but soon, like all the cats, recovered his hold and jumped  down to the ground, when he skulked away with his tail behind him.    \"I must really leave off, warned both by my paper and your impatience.  Well, I grew stronger and bigger every day, and swung by one arm almost  as well as the rest did with their two. I got, in fact, so strong on my  hind feet, that my toes were actually in time thicker than those of any  of my race. It is well, my dear Orang, to use what you have left you,  and to try as soon as possible to forget what has been taken from you.    \"... Look at my portrait, I am as strong, and as bony, and as bonnie, as  any gorilla. But I begin to boast, so I will leave off.\"           *       *       *       *       *    No doubt that gorilla's injured arm affected its habits and its activity  every day of its life. The broken arm, never set by some gorilla surgeon  of celebrity, formed a highly important feature in its biography.  Reader! when next thou visitest the noble Museum in Bloomsbury, look at  the skeleton of that gorilla, whose probable story Arachnophilus hath  tried to give thee, and remember that both skin and skeleton were  exhibited there before Du Chaillu became \"a lion.\"    The gorilla is a native of West Africa. It is closely allied to the  chimpanzee, but grows to a larger size, and has many striking anatomical  characters and external marks to distinguish it. It is certainly much  dreaded by the natives on the banks of the Gaboon, and, doubtless,  dreads them equally. Dr Gray procured a large specimen in a tub from  that district. It was skinned and set up by Mr Bartlett. I have seen  photographs in the hands of my excellent old friend--that admirable  natural history and anatomical draughtsman--Mr George Ford of Hatton  Garden. These photographs were taken from its truly ugly face as it was  pulled out of the stinking brine. Life in death, or death in life, it  was most repulsive.    Professor Owen read a most elaborate paper on the gorilla before the  Zoological Society. The great comparative anatomist and zoologist shows  that it _may_ have been the very species whose skins were brought by  Hanno to Carthage, in times before the Christian era, as the skins of  _hairy wild men_. The historian refers to them as \"gorullai\" ([Greek:  Goryllai].)    The natives of West Africa name it \"N'Geena.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The stuffed specimen at the Museum is a young male. Its preparation does  great credit to Mr Bartlett's care and knowledge, for the hair over  nearly all the body was in patches among the spirit--thoroughly  corrupted in its alcoholic strength by animal matter. The peculiarly  anthropoid and morbidly-disagreeable look that even the face of the  young gorilla had was, of course, perfect in the photograph. In the  _Leisure Hour_, a tolerably good cut of it was given, but the artist did  not copy the label accurately, for on the photograph from which that cut  was derived, _another name_ was rendered by _that_ sun, who pays no  compliments and tells no lies. Professor Owen, the greatest of  comparative anatomists, has made the subject of anthropoid apes his own,  by the perfection of his researches, continued and continuous. He would  have liked, at least I may venture, I believe, to say so (if the matter  gave him more than a moment's thought), that the name of Dr Gray had  been on that label.      _Letter from C. Waterton, Esq., mentioning a young gorilla._                                              WALTON HALL, _Feb_. 4, 1856.    \"DEAR SIR,--As your favour of the 28th did not seem to require an  immediate answer I put it aside for a while, having a multiplicity of  business then on hand, and being obliged to be from home for a couple of  days.    \"I beg to enclose you the letter to which you allude.    \"Pray do not suppose that for one single moment I should be illiberal  enough to undervalue a 'closet naturalist.' 'Non cuivis homini contingit  adire corinthum.' It does not fall to every one's lot to range through  the forests of Guiana, still, a gentleman given to natural history may  do wonders for it in his own apartments on his native soil; and had  Audubon, Swainson, Jameson, &c., not attacked me in all the pride of  pompous self-conceit, I should have been the last man in the world to  expose their gross ignorance.    \"You ask me 'If we are to have another volume of essays?' I beg to  answer, no. Last year, Mrs Loudon (to whom I made a present of the  essays) wrote to me, and asked for a few papers to be inserted in a  forthcoming edition. I answered, that as I had had some strange and  awful adventures since the 'Autobiography' made its appearance, I would  tack them on to it. But from that time to this, I have never had a line,  either from Mrs Loudon or from her publishers. But some months ago,  having made a present of a superb case of preserved specimens in natural  history to the Jesuits' College in Lancashire, I gave directions to my  stationer at Wakefield to procure me from London the fourth or last  edition of the essays; and I made references to it accordingly. But, lo  and behold, when I had opened this supposed fourth edition, I saw  printed on the title page 'a new edition.' Better had they printed a  _fifth edition_. This threw all my references wrong. Should you be  passing by Messrs Longman, perhaps you will have the goodness to ask  when this 'new edition' was printed.    \"I am sorry you did not show me your drawing of the chimpanzee before it  was engraved. The artist has not done justice to it. He has made the  ears far too large.[7] The little brown chimpanzee has very small ears;  fully as small in proportion as those of a genuine negro. I am half  inclined to give to the world a little treatise on the monkey tribe. I  am prepared to show that Linnaeus, Buffon, and all our hosts of  naturalists who have copied the remarks of these celebrated naturalists,  are perfectly in the dark with regard to the true character of _all_ the  monkey tribe. Yesterday, I sent up to the _Gardener's Chronicle_ a few  notes on the woodpecker.--Believe me, dear sir, very truly yours,                                                         CHARLES WATERTON.    \"P.S.--Many thanks for your nice little treatise on the chimpanzee.\"    Mr Waterton enclosed me a copy of the following letter, which he  published in a Yorkshire newspaper:--       _To Mrs Wombwell._    \"MADAM,--I am truly sorry that the inclemency of the weather has  prevented the inhabitants of this renowned watering-place from visiting  your wonderful gorilla, or brown orang-outang.    \"I have passed two hours in its company, and I have been gratified  beyond expression.    \"Would that all lovers of natural history could get a sight of it, as,  possibly, they may never see another of the same species in this  country.    \"It differs widely in one respect from all other orang-outangs which  have been exhibited in England--namely, that, when on the ground, it  never walks on the soles of its fore-feet, but on the knuckles of the  toes of those feet; and those toes are doubled up like the closed fist  of a man. This must be a painful position; and, to relieve itself, the  animal catches hold of visitors, and clings caressingly to Miss Bright,  who exhibits it. Here then, it is at rest, with the toes of the  fore-feet performing their natural functions, which they never do when  the animal is on the ground.    \"Hence I draw the conclusion that this singular quadruped, like the  sloth, is not a walker on the ground of its own free-will, but by  accident only.    \"No doubt whatever it is born, and lives, and dies aloft, amongst the  trees in the forests of Africa.    \"Put it on a tree, and then it will immediately have the full use of the  toes of its fore-feet. Place it on the ground, and then you will see  that the toes of the fore-feet become useless, as I have already  described.    \"That it may retain its health, and thus remunerate you for the large  sum which you have expended in the purchase of it, is, madam, the  sincere hope of your obedient servant and well-wisher,                                                        CHARLES WATERTON.\"    Scarborough Cliff, No. 1,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#6)"],[1,"e,  indicated by a few small, scattering pines and many thick clumps of  bushes. Suddenly a loud, melodious song brought me to a standstill. It  came from the bushes at the side of the trail. Although I turned aside  and sought diligently, I could not find the shy lyrist. Another song of  the same kind soon reached me from a distance. Farther down the path a  white-crowned sparrow appeared, courting his mate. With crown-feathers  and head and tail erect, he would glide to the top of a stone, then down  into the grass where his lady-love sat; up and down, up and down he  scuttled again and again. My approach put an end to the picturesque  little comedy. The lady scurried away into hiding, while the little  prince with the snow-white diadem mounted to the top of a bush and  whistled the very strain that had surprised me so a little while before,  farther up the slope. Yes, I had stumbled into the summer home of the  white-crowned sparrow, which on the Atlantic coast and the central  portions of the American continent breeds far in the North.    It was not long before I was regaled with a white-crown vesper concert.  From every part of the lonely valley the voices sounded. And what did  they say? \"Oh, de-e-e-ar, de-e-ar, Whittier, Whittier,\" sometimes  adding, in low, caressing tones, \"Dear Whittier\"--one of the most  melodious tributes to the Quaker poet I have ever heard. Here I also saw  my first mountain bluebird, whose back and breast are wholly blue, there  being no rufous at all in his plumage. He was feeding a youngster  somewhere among the snags. A red-shafted flicker flew across the vale  and called, \"Zwick-ah! zwick-ah!\" and then pealed out his loud call just  like the eastern yellow-shafted high-holder. Why the Rocky Mountain  region changes the lining of the flicker's wings from gold to  crimson--who can tell? A robin--the western variety--sang his  \"Cheerily,\" a short distance up the hollow, right at the boundary of the  timber-line.    [Illustration: \"_Dear Whittier_\"    _White-Crowned Sparrow_]    About half-past five I found myself a few hundred feet below timber-line  in the lone valley, which was already beginning to look shadowy and a  little uncanny, the tall ridges that leaped up at the right obscuring  the light of the declining sun. My purpose had been to find  accommodations at a mountaineer's cabin far down the valley, in the  neighborhood of the Seven Lakes; but I had tarried too long on the  mountain, absorbed in watching the birds, and the danger now was that,  if I ventured farther down the hollow, I should lose my way and be  compelled to spend the night alone in this deserted place. I am neither  very brave nor very cowardly; but, in any case, such a prospect was not  pleasing to contemplate. Besides, I was by no means sure of being able  to secure lodgings at the mountaineer's shanty, even if I should be able  to find it in the dark. There seemed to be only one thing to do--to  climb back to the signal station on the summit.    I turned about and began the ascent. How much steeper the acclivities  were than they had seemed to be when I came down! My limbs ached before  I had gone many rods, and my breath came short. Upward I toiled, and by  the time my trail reached the cog-road I was ready to drop from  exhaustion. Yet I had not gone more than a third of the way to the top.  I had had no supper, but was too weary even to crave food, my only  desire being to find some place wherein to rest. Night had now come, but  fortunately the moon shone brightly from a sky that was almost clear,  and I had no difficulty in following the road.    Wearily I began to climb up the steep cog-wheel track. Having trudged  around one curve, I came to a portion of the road that stretched  straight up before me for what seemed an almost interminable distance,  and, oh! the way looked so steep, almost as if it would tumble back upon  my head. Could I ever drag myself up to the next bend in the track? By  a prodigious effort I did this at last--it seemed \"at last\" to me, at  all events--and, lo! there gleamed before me another long stretch of  four steel rails.    My breath came shorter and shorter, until I was compelled to open my  mouth widely and gasp the cold, rarefied air, which, it seemed, would  not fill my chest with the needed oxygen. Sharp pains shot through my  lungs, especially in the extremities far down in the chest; my head and  eye-balls ached, and it seemed sometimes as if they would burst; my  limbs trembled with weakness, and I tottered and reeled like a drunken  man from side to side of the road, having to watch carefully lest I  might topple over the edge and meet with a serious accident. Still that  relentless track, with its quartette of steel rails, stretched steep  before me in the distance.    For the last half mile or more I was compelled to fling myself down upon  the track every few rods to rest and recover breath. Up, up, the road  climbed, until at length I reached the point where it ceases to swing  around the shoulders of the mountain, and ascends directly to the  summit. Here was the steepest climb of all. By throwing my weary frame  on the track at frequent intervals and resting for five minutes, taking  deep draughts of air between my parched lips, I at last came in sight of  the government building. It is neither a mansion nor a palace, not even  a cottage, but never before was I so glad to get a glimpse of a building  erected by human hands. It was past nine o'clock when I staggered up to  the door and rang the night bell, having spent more than three hours and  a half in climbing about two miles and a half. Too weary to sleep, I  tossed for hours on my bed. At last, however, \"nature's sweet restorer\"  came to my relief, and I slept the deep sleep of unconsciousness until  seven o'clock the next morning, allowing the sun to rise upon the Peak  without getting up to greet him. That omission may have been an  unpardonable sin, for one of the chief fads of visitors is to see the  sun rise from the Peak; but I must say in my defence that, in the first  place, I failed to wake up in time to witness the Day King's advent,  and, in a second place, being on bird lore intent rather than scenic  wonders, my principal need was to recruit my strength for the tramping  to be done during the day. The sequel proved that, for my special  purpose, I had chosen the wiser course.    By eight o'clock I had written a letter home, eaten a refreshing  breakfast, paying a dollar for it, and another for lodging, and was  starting down the mountain, surprised at the exhilaration I felt, in  view of my extreme exhaustion of the evening before. I naturally  expected to feel stiff and sore in every joint, languid and woe-be-gone;  but such was not the case. It is wonderful how soon one recovers  strength among these heights. How bracing is the cool mountain air, if  you breathe it deeply! As I began the descent, I whistled and  sang,--that is, I tried to. To be frank, it was all noise and no music,  but I must have some way of giving expression to the uplifted emotions  that filled my breast. Again and again I said to myself, \"I'm so glad!  I'm so glad! I'm so glad!\" It was gladness pure and simple,--the  dictionary has no other word to express it. No pen can do justice to the  panorama of mountain and valley and plain as viewed from such a height  on a clear, crisp morning of June. One felt like exclaiming with George  Herbert:        \"Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,        The bridal of the earth and sky!\"    So far as the aesthetic value of it went, I was monarch of all I  surveyed, even though mile on mile of grandeur and glory was spread out  before me. The quatrain of Lowell recurred to my mind:        \"'Tis heaven alone that is given away,      'Tis only God may be had for the asking;      No price is set on the lavish summer;      June may be had by poorest comer.\"    Before leaving the Peak, I watched a flock of birds eating from the  waste-heap at the Summit House. They were the brown-capped rosy finches,  called scientifically _Leucosticte australis_. Their plumage was a rich  chocolate, suffused over neck, breast, and back with intense crimson,  while the pileum was quite black. With one exception--the white-tailed  ptarmigan--they range the highest in summer of all Colorado birds. They  are never seen below timber-line in that season, and are not known to  breed below twelve thousand feet; thence to the tops of the highest  peaks they hatch and rear their young. In August old and young swarm  over the summits picking edible insects from the snow, while in winter  they descend to timber-line, where most of them remain to brave the  arctic weather and its frequent storms.    Bidding a regretful good-by to the summit, for it held me as by a  magician's spell, I hastened down the steep incline of the cog-wheel  road, past Windy Point, and turning to the right, descended across the  green slope below the boulder region to the open, sunlit valley which I  had visited on the previous afternoon. It was an idyllic place, a  veritable paradise for birds. Such a chorus as greeted me from the  throats of I know not how many white-crowned sparrows,--several dozen,  perhaps,--it would have done the heart of any lover of avian minstrelsy  good to listen to. The whole valley seemed to be transfigured by their  roundelays, which have about them such an air of poetry and old-world  romance. During the morning I was so fortunate as to find a nest, the  first of this species that I had ever discovered. Providence had never  before cast my lot with these birds in their breeding haunts. The nest  was a pretty structure placed on the ground, beneath a bush amid the  green grass, its holdings consisting of four dainty, pale-blue eggs,  speckled with brown. The female leaped from her seat as I passed near,  and in that act divulged her little family secret. Although she chirped  uneasily as I bent "]]]
