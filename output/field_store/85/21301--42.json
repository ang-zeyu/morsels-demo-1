Quietly picking up his tool, he walked forward to the weird, white  thing still advancing.  He reached it, then turned with it towards the  crouching grave wreckers.  Halting about ten yards from them, Bill  shouted, \"Paddy Doolan.\"    \"Yis, Bill,\" was the timorous reply.    \"It's an Irish ghost--a Kerry one.\"    \"What is it?\" said Claud, rising and shaking off the supernatural fear  which had held him for a moment.    \"It's a white donkey on the loose,\" answered Bill, bursting into  laughter.  Paddy recovered instantly and joined with the others in the  admiration of the innocent ass which had strayed from its usual haunts.  After sniffing its new-found friends, the donkey let out a terrible  bray, flung up its heels and departed into the night.    They recommenced their digging operations; so engrossed were they with  their discoveries that they did not hear the approach of some  chattering natives.  These dusky gents were within fifty yards of them  when Bill whispered, \"Keep still--lie down.\"  They obeyed, and lying  flat on the ground saw some Arabs go by.  They could just see their  figures against the sky, and had time to note that they carried shovels.    \"On the same game,\" whispered Bill.    \"Yes,\" said Claud, \"I believe they make a speciality of digging up  these dead folks.   Glad they weren't Kerry ghosts, anyway.\"    \"Be aisy, boys, you'll meet a ghost yet before ye die.\"    The work was resumed once more.  About 2 A.M., when all thought they  had had enough of this body-snatching, they were startled with the cry  of, \"Help, boys!  Help!  They're killing me.\"    \"By Jove!  That's the Queenslander.  These niggers are at him.  Come  on, boys,\" shouted Claud, lifting his entrenching tool and running  towards the place from whence came the cry for help.    \"Help!  Help!\" rang out the cry again, this time it was more muffled  and weak.    \"Where are you, Sambo?\"    \"In here,\" came a faint reply.    The sound came from a square building, the door of which was open.  Claud dashed in, flashing his light as he went.  Turning a corner, he  was amazed by a strange and striking spectacle.    Sambo lay struggling and kicking surrounded by four great hulking  Arabs, who had been beating, kicking and biting him in a furious  struggle.  The faces of all were bleeding and bruised, and blood was  splashed over the white sort of overall that the natives wear.  To the  left of Sambo Claud saw an open tomb.  Inside he could just see a kind  of coffin arrangement, and on the ground, near at hand, the most varied  collection of brass and other beautiful Eastern wares.  This was the  cause of the bother.    Crack! went Claud's fist into the eyes of the nearest Arab.    \"Take that, ye son of a sea cook,\" chimed in Bill, giving another the  knock-out blow.    \"Here's one from Paddy Doolan,\" shouted the Hibernian as he, too, hit  his man.  The fourth one was dealt with by Claud.  With shrieks and  yells of \"Allah, Allah!\" the Arabs turned, and, jumping a low wall,  fled off into the night.  Sambo was at once released.  Meantime, Sandy,  as the unofficial cashier of the expedition, made an inventory of the  treasure trove.  It appears that Sambo had scented out in a strange way  a very ancient and dilapidated tomb, which these Arab robbers had  intended to despoil at the same time.    \"Here, boys,\" said Sandy, \"it's time we were hame.  I've had enough o'  skulls, shin banes and brass beer bottles.\"    \"An' I've had enough of ghosts,\" growled Paddy, as they staggered down  the road with their load of curios.  The car whisked them back to Mena  Camp again.  Stealthily creeping through the lines, they arrived at  their tents.  All crept to bed, weary and wiser men.  Claud was the  last one to fall asleep.  He was thinking of Sybil, the girl from the  Bush.  At last Morpheus claimed him.  As he was slipping away into the  dreamy unknown he heard Doolan muttering, \"Ghosts!  Be Jasus!  Ghosts!\"          CHAPTER V    SYBIL, THE SQUATTER'S GIRL    \"By Jove!  What a stunning girl.  She's a peach!\" whispered a Yeomanry  subaltern to his Australian friend as a beautiful girl entered the  spacious dining-room of Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo.    \"Why, that's Sybil Graham--haven't seen her since she was a kid.  My  word, she is a beauty now,\" said the Australian officer.    \"Who is she?\"    \"One of our squatter's girls.  That's her father and mother with her.  They've got miles of land, plenty of sheep and heaps of tin.  He'll be  a lucky fellow who gets her.\"    \"You know, old chap, I never thought you produced women like that in  Australia.  No offence, you know.  What I really mean is that the sun,  the want of what we call society, and the lack of cultured institutions  such as we have at home, must be a great handicap in bringing up a  girl.\"    \"Young man, you're talking through your hat,\" was the blunt reply.  \"We  have ladies in Australia just as we have at home.  And can you guess  what we haven't got?\"    \"No.\"    \"Snobs!  No time for all your damned conventions--'At Home' scandals  and Society calls.  These girls of the bush are natural, jolly,  unconventional, but not loose.  So far and no farther is their attitude  to mankind.  And they've got an independence of character which knocks  you fellows sick when you meet them.  They don't want any of these  insidious palavers and hollow attentions, and they'll tell a man pretty  quick what they think.  My word! can't they choke a Johnny off.\"    \"But, my dear fellow, all my friends who have visited Australia say  they haven't got manners, and all have a cockney twang.  When they open  their mouths they always spoil the picture.\"    \"I expect your friends have been dealing with the Pitt Street toughs or  Manly larrikins.  By the way you speak, I don't suppose they have ever  been in the bush or visited some of our squatters' homes.  Do you know  that some of these squatters are descendants of some of the finest  families in England.  Apart from that, you will find better ladies on a  squatter's veranda than you will in Park Lane.  I have been in London,  young fellow; in fact, I'm English, although I've been a long time in  Australia.  So don't say I'm biased.  But I am speaking from an  intimate knowledge of the people--not from a superficial glance which a  hen-brained tourist gets.  It isn't affectation, trinkets, dresses and  a Society drawl that makes a lady.  That's your standard.  Society at  home--at least, in certain circles, is the most hollow and unhappy  creation I know.  Everyone is in it, because they've got to be, but  every real white man or woman knows that it's the rottenest show on  earth.  We don't stand for all that sort of thing out there.  They  accept folks for what they are worth--I mean, if a person is decent,  law-abiding, cheerful and ambitious, the door of the Premier, squatter  and merchant is open to him.\"    \"Look here, old chap, you can't chuck convention overboard entirely;  it's impossible.\"    \"Rot!  You speak as if Australia was a primitive land, without schools  and culture.  You're entirely mistaken.  We can educate and create a  most charming and distinctive type.  I grant you that some of our  people may be narrow-visioned and have one-eyed views.  I admit you  will find a few folks who think Britain is a land of peers, publicans  and paupers.  But haven't you got in Britain the same narrow folks, the  same crude, ill-informed men and women who ignorantly air their views  to the disgust of every Colonial?\"    \"Yes, there's something in that, I agree.  We have got them, but I've  heard Australian officers talk as if Australia was the only place on  God's earth,\" the subaltern ejaculated a little warmly.    \"You condemn a nation for a few.  Young man, you haven't travelled far  enough.  And you make me tired to hear you talk in that way.  You're a  nice fellow spoiled, I reckon.  Why, where I live there's dozens of  English public school men working as cockies and jackaroos.  They  wouldn't go back home if you paid them.  They like the life.  Everybody  makes them at home, and many of them have married our Australian girls.  These women can milk, bake, ride, drive, sew and rear the most charming  children.  And they can meet you in a drawing-room with a natural grace  that is their own.  Intellectually, too, they are pleasant to meet, for  the loneliness has given them time to think and read.  Look at that  girl there, doesn't she look a lady?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Isn't she absolutely perfect?\"    \"Well, yes.\"    \"Does her dress fit?\"    \"Decidedly.\"    \"Do you think her table manners are awkward?\"    \"No.\"    \"Isn't there something easy and natural, no false pose, a sort of  innate grace of mind and body?\"    \"Certainly, but is this not some strange exception, just as you find in  many parts?\"    \"No, my boy.  You still seem to be unconvinced.  Hang it all, there's  only one way to convince you.  As they are rising from the table now,  get up and I'll introduce you.\"    \"Hallo, Sybil, how are you?\" said the Australian officer going forward.    \"What--Jack Gordon!\" she said, shaking hands.  \"I haven't seen you  since I was at school.\"    \"How do, Jack?\" said old Graham, in his blunt way.  Then Mrs. Graham  accorded him the same warm welcome.    \"Let me introduce Lieutenant Gore-Jones of the Yeomanry.  Take him in  hand, Sybil.  He's a good fellow spoiled.\"    \"All right, Jack,\" said Sybil, smiling, and stepping towards the wide  veranda with her new-found friend.  Gordon remained behind with the  parents to talk of old times.    \"This _is_ a pleasure,\" said Jones as they sat down.  \"I never thought  of meeting such a charming person from down under.\"    Sybil frowned a little, then looking straight into his eyes said, \"I  don't like honey, Mr. Jones, it's too sweet, and sweet things are often  sickly.\"    \"I--I--I beg your pardon,\" he stammered, blushing a little.    \"I'm afraid you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#6)"],[1," knothole  in the floor without wetting the wood.    Next in age came Lanky Smith, a small, undersized man of retiring  disposition. Then came Skinny Thompson, six feet four on his bared  soles, and true to his name; Hopalong described him as \"th' shadow of a  chalk mark.\" Pete Wilson, the slow-witted and very taciturn, and  Billy Williams, the wavering pessimist, were of ordinary height and  appearance. Red Connors, with hair that shamed the name, was the  possessor of a temper which was as dry as tinder; his greatest weakness  was his regard for the rifle as a means of preserving peace. Johnny  Nelson was the protege, and he could do no wrong.    The last, Hopalong Cassidy, was a combination of irresponsibility,  humor, good nature, love of fighting, and nonchalance when face to face  with danger. His most prominent attribute was that of always getting  into trouble without any intention of so doing; in fact, he was much  aggrieved and surprised when it came. It seemed as though when any \"bad  man\" desired to add to his reputation he invariably selected Hopalong as  the means (a fact due, perhaps, to the perversity of things in general).  Bad men became scarce soon after Hopalong became a fixture in any  locality. He had been crippled some years before in a successful  attempt to prevent the assassination of a friend, Sheriff Harris, of  Albuquerque, and he still possessed a limp.    When Red had relieved his feelings and had dug the alkali out of his  ears and eyes, he led the Sioux to the rear of the saloon, where a  \"pinto\" was busily engaged in endeavoring to pitch a saddle from his  back, employing the intervals in trying to see how much of the picket  rope he could wrap around his legs.    When By-and-by saw what he was expected to ride he felt somewhat  relieved, for the pony did not appear to have more than the ordinary  amount of cussedness. He waved his hand, and Johnny and Red bandaged the  animal's eyes, which quieted him at once, and then they untangled  the rope from around his legs and saw that the cinches were secure.  Motioning to By-and-by that all was ready, they jerked the bandage off  as the Indian settled himself in the saddle.    Had By-and-by been really sober he would have taken the conceit out of  that pony in chunks, and as it was he experienced no great difficulty in  holding his seat; but in his addled state of mind he grasped the end of  the cinch strap in such a way that when the pony jumped forward in  its last desperate effort the buckle slipped and the cinch became  unfastened; and By-and-by, still seated in the saddle, flew head  foremost into the horse trough, where he spilled much water.    As this happened Cowan turned the corner, and when he saw the wasted  water (which he had to carry, bucketful at a time, from the wells a good  quarter of a mile away) his anger blazed forth, and yelling, he ran  for the drenched Sioux, who was just crawling out of his bath. When the  unfortunate saw the irate man bearing down on him he sputtered in rage  and fear, and, turning, he ran down the street, with Cowan thundering  flatfootedly behind on a fat man's gallop, to the hysterical cheers of  the delighted outfit, who saw in it nothing but a good joke.    When Cowan returned from his hopeless task, blowing and wheezing, he  heard sundry remarks, sotto voce, which were not calculated to increase  his opinion of his physical condition.    \"Seems to me,\" remarked the irrepressible Hopalong, \"that one of those  cayuses has got th' heaves.\"    \"It shore sounds like it,\" acquiesced Johnny, red in the face from  holding in his laughter, \"an' say, somebody interferes.\"    \"All knock-kneed animals do, yu heathen,\" supplied Red.    \"Hey, yu, let up on that and have a drink on th' house,\" invited  Cowan. \"If I gits that durn war whoop I'll make yu think there's been  a cyclone. I'll see how long that bum hangs around this here burg, I  will.\"    Red's eyes narrowed and his temper got the upper hand. \"He ain't no bum  when yu gives him rotgut at a quarter of a dollar a glass, is he? Any  time that 'bum' gits razzled out for nothin' more'n this, why, I goes  too; an' I ain't sayin' nothin' about goin' peaceable--like, neither.\"    \"I knowed somethin' like this 'ud happen,\" dolefully sang out Billy  Williams, strong on the side of his pessimism.    \"For th' Lord's sake, have you broke out?\" asked Red, disgustedly. \"I'm  goin' to hit the trail--but just keep this afore yore mind: if By-and-by  gits in any accidents or ain't in sight when I comes to town again, this  here climate'll be a heep sight hotter'n it is now. No hard feelings,  sabe? It's just a casual bit of advice. Come on, fellows, let's  amble--I'm hungry.\"    As they raced across the plain toward the ranch a pair of beady eyes,  snapping with a drunken rage, watched them from an arroyo; and when  Cowan entered the saloon the next morning he could not find By-and-by's  rifle, which he had placed behind the bar. He also missed a handful of  cartridges from the box near the cash drawer; and had he looked closely  at his bottled whisky he would have noticed a loss there. A horse was  missing from a Mexican's corral and there were rumors that several  Indians had been seen far out on the plain.        CHAPTER V. The Law of the Range      \"Phew! I'm shore hungry,\" said Hopalong, as he and Red dismounted at the  ranch the next morning for breakfast. \"Wonder what's good for it?\"    \"They's three things that's good for famine,\" said Red, leading the way  to the bunk house. \"Yu can pull in yore belt, yu can drink, an yu can  eat. Yore getting as bad as Johnny--but he's young yet.\"    The others met their entrance with a volley of good-humored banter, some  of which was so personal and evoked such responses that it sounded like  the preliminary skirmish to a fight. But under all was that soft accent,  that drawl of humorous appreciation and eyes twinkling in suppressed  merriment. Here they were thoroughly at home and the spirit of  comradeship manifested itself in many subtle ways; the wit became more  daring and sharp, Billy lost some of his pessimism, and the alertness  disappeared from their manner.    Skinny left off romping with Red and yawned. \"I wish that cook'ud wake  up an' git breakfast. He's the cussedest hombre I ever saw--he kin go to  sleep standin' up an' not know it. Johnny's th' boy that worries him--th'  kid comes in an' whoops things up till he's gorged himself.\"    \"Johnny's got th' most appallin' feel for grub of anybody I knows,\"  added Red. \"I wonder what's keepin' him--he's usually hangin' around here  bawlin' for his grub like a spoiled calf, long afore cookie's got th'  fire goin'.\"    \"Mebby he rustled some grub out with him--I saw him tip-toein' out of th'  gallery this mornin' when I come back for my cigs,\" remarked Hopalong,  glancing at Billy.    Billy groaned and made for the gallery. Emerging half a minute later he  blurted out his tale of woe: \"Every time I blows myself an' don't drink  it all in town some slab-sided maverick freezes to it. It's gone,\" he  added, dismally.    \"Too bad, Billy--but what is it?\" asked Skinny.    \"What is it? Wha'd yu think it was, you emaciated match? Jewelry?  Cayuses? It's whisky--two simoleons' worth. Some-thin's allus wrong. This  here whole yearth's wrong, just like that cross-eyed sky pilot said over  to--\"    \"Will yu let up?\" Yelled Red, throwing a sombrero at the grumbling  unfortunate. \"Yu ask Buck where yore tanglefoot is.    \"I'd shore look nice askin' th' boss if he'd rustled my whisky, wouldn't  I? An' would yu mind throwin' somebody else's hat? I paid twenty wheels  for that eight years ago, and I don't want it mussed none.\"    \"Gee, yore easy! Why, Ah Sing, over at Albuquerque, gives them away  every time yu gits yore shirt washed,\" gravely interposed Hopalong as he  went out to cuss the cook.    \"Well, what'd yu think of that?\" Exclaimed Billy in an injured tone.    \"Oh, yu needn't be hikin' for Albuquerque--WasheeWashee'ud charge yu  double for washin' yore shirt. Yu ought to fall in di' river some  day--then he might talk business,\" called Hopalong over his shoulder  as he heaved an old boot into the gallery. \"Hey, yu hibernatin' son of  morphine, if yu don't git them flapjacks in here pretty sudden-like  I'll scatter yu all over di' landscape, sabe? Yu just wait till Johnny  comes!\"    \"Wonder where th' kid is?\" asked Lanky, rolling a cigarette. \"Off  somewhere lookin' at di' sun through di' bottom of my bottle,\" grumbled  Billy.    Hopalong started to go out, but halted on the sill and looked steadily  off toward the northwest. \"That's funny. Hey, fellows, here comes Buck  an' Johnny ridin' double--on a walk, too!\" he exclaimed. \"Wonder what  th'--thunder! Red, Buck's carryun' him! Somethin's busted!\" he yelled, as  he dashed for his pony and made for the newcomers.    \"I told yu he was hittin' my bottle,\" pertly remarked Billy, as he  followed the rest outside.    \"Did yu ever see Johnny drunk? Did yu ever see him drink more'n two  glasses? Shut yore wailin' face--they's somethin' worse'n that in this  here,\" said Red, his temper rising. \"Hopalong an' me took yore cheap  liquor--it's under Pete's bunk,\" he added.    The trio approached on a walk and Johnny, delirious and covered with  blood, was carried into the bunk house. Buck waited until all had  assembled again and then, his face dark with anger, spoke sharply and  without the usual drawl: \"Skragged from behind, blast them! Get some  grub an' water an' be quick. We'll see who the gent with th' grudge is.\"    At this point the expostulations of the indignant cook, who, not  understanding the cause, regarded the invasion of china shop bulls as  sacrilegious, came to his ears. Striding quickly to the door, he grabbed  the pan the Mexican was about to throw and, turning the now frightened  man around, thundered, \"Keep quiet an' get 'em some grub.\"    When rifles and ammunition had been secured they mounted "]]]
