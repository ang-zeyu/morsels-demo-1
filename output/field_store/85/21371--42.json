[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#6)"],[1,"of their hearts), why should we  banish friendship from our lives, for fear of being involved by it  in some amount of distress? If you take away emotion, what difference  remains I don't say between a man and a beast, but between a man and a  stone or a log of wood, or anything else of that kind?    Neither should we give any weight to the doctrine that virtue is  something rigid and unyielding as iron. In point of fact it is in regard  to friendship, as in so many other things, so supple and sensitive that  it expands, so to speak, at a friend's good fortune, contracts at his  misfortunes. We conclude then that mental pain which we must often  encounter on a friend's account is not of sufficient consequence to  banish friendship from our life, any more than it is true that the  cardinal virtues are to be dispensed with because they involve certain  anxieties and distresses.    14. Let me repeat then, \"the clear indication of virtue, to which a  mind of like character is naturally attracted, is the beginning of  friendship.\" When that is the case the rise of affection is a necessity.  For what can be more irrational than to take delight in many objects  incapable of response, such as office, fame, splendid buildings, and  personal decoration, and yet to take little or none in a sentient being  endowed with virtue, which has the faculty of loving or, if I may use  the expression, loving back? For nothing is really more delightful than  a return of affection, and the mutual interchange of kind feeling  and good offices. And if we add, as we may fairly do, that nothing so  powerfully attracts and draws one thing to itself as likeness does to  friendship, it will at once be admitted to be true that the good love  the good and attach them to themselves as though they were united by  blood and nature. For nothing can be more eager, or rather greedy, for  what is like itself than nature. So, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, we  may look upon this as an established fact, that between good men there  is, as it were of necessity, a kindly feeling, which is the source of  friendship ordained by nature. But this same kindliness affects the many  also. For that is no unsympathetic or selfish or exclusive virtue, which  protects even whole nations and consults their best interests. And that  certainly it would not have done had it disdained all affection for the  common herd.    Again, the believers in the \"interest\" theory appear to me to destroy  the most attractive link in the chain of friendship. For it is not so  much what one gets by a friend that gives one pleasure, as the warmth  of his feeling; and we only care for a friend's service if it has been  prompted by affection. And so far from its being true that lack of means  is a motive for seeking friendship, it is usually those who being most  richly endowed with wealth and means, and above all with virtue (which,  after all, is a man's best support), are least in need of another, that  are most openhanded and beneficent. Indeed I am inclined to think that  friends ought at times to be in want of something. For instance, what  scope would my affections have had if Scipio had never wanted my advice  or co-operation at home or abroad? It is not friendship, then, that  follows material advantage, but material advantage friendship.    15. We must not therefore listen to these superfine gentlemen when they  talk of friendship, which they know neither in theory nor in practice.  For who, in heaven's name, would choose a life of the greatest wealth  and abundance on condition of neither loving or being beloved by any  creature? That is the sort of life tyrants endure. They, of course, can  count on no fidelity, no affection, no security for the goodwill of  any one. For them all is suspicion and anxiety; for them there is no  possibility of friendship. Who can love one whom he fears, or by whom he  knows that he is feared? Yet such men have a show of friendship offered  them, but it is only a fair-weather show. If it ever happen that they  fall, as it generally does, they will at once understand how friendless  they are. So they say Tarquin observed in his exile that he never knew  which of his friends were real and which sham, until he had ceased to  be able to repay either. Though what surprises me is that a man of his  proud and overbearing character should have a friend at all. And as it  was his character that prevented his having genuine friends, so it often  happens in the case of men of unusually great means--their very wealth  forbids faithful friendships. For not only is Fortune blind herself;  but she generally makes those blind also who enjoy her favours. They are  carried, so to speak, beyond themselves with self-conceit and self-will;  nor can anything be more perfectly intolerable than a successful fool.  You may often see it. Men who before had pleasant manners enough undergo  a complete change on attaining power of office. They despise their old  friends: devote themselves to new.    Now, can anything be more foolish than that men who have all the  opportunities which prosperity, wealth, and great means can bestow,  should secure all else which money can buy--horses, servants, splendid  upholstering, and costly plate--but do not secure friends, who are, if  I may use the expression, the most valuable and beautiful furniture  of life? And yet, when they acquire the former, they know not who will  enjoy them, nor for whom they may be taking all this trouble; for they  will one and all eventually belong to the strongest: while each man has  a stable and inalienable ownership in his friendships. And even if those  possessions, which are, in a manner, the gifts of fortune, do prove  permanent, life can never be anything but joyless which is without the  consolations and companionship of friends.    16. To turn to another branch of our subject. We must now endeavour  to ascertain what limits are to be observed in friendship--what is the  boundary-line, so to speak, beyond which our affection is not to go. On  this point I notice three opinions, with none of which I agree. One is  _that we should love our friend just as much as we love ourselves, and  no more; another, that our affection to them should exactly correspond  and equal theirs to us; a third, that a man should be valued at exactly  the same rate as he values himself_. To not one of these opinions do I  assent. The first, which holds that our regard for ourselves is to be  the measure of our regard for our friend, is not true; for how many  things there are which we would never have done for our own sakes, but  do for the sake of a friend! We submit to make requests from unworthy  people, to descend even to supplication; to be sharper in invective,  more violent in attack. Such actions are not creditable in our own  interests, but highly so in those of our friends. There are many  advantages too which men of upright character voluntarily forego, or  of which they are content to be deprived, that their friends may enjoy  them rather than themselves.    The second doctrine is that which limits friendship to an exact equality  in mutual good offices and good feelings. But such a view reduces  friendship to a question of figures in a spirit far too narrow and  illiberal, as though the object were to have an exact balance in  a debtor and creditor account. True friendship appears to me to be  something richer and more generous than that comes to; and not to be so  narrowly on its guard against giving more than it receives. In such a  matter we must not be always afraid of something being wasted or running  over in our measure, or of more than is justly due being devoted to our  friendship.    But the last limit proposed is the worst, namely, that a friend's  estimate of himself is to be the measure of our estimate of him. It  often happens that a man has too humble an idea of himself, or takes too  despairing a view of his chance of bettering his fortune. In such a case  a friend ought not to take the view of him which he takes of himself.  Rather he should do all he can to raise his drooping spirits, and lead  him to more cheerful hopes and thoughts.    We must then find some other limit. But I must first mention the  sentiment which used to call forth Scipio's severest criticism. He often  said that no one ever gave utterance to anything more diametrically  opposed to the spirit of friendship than the author of the dictum, \"You  should love your friend with the consciousness that you may one day  hate him.\" He could not be induced to believe that it was rightfully  attributed to Bias, who was counted as one of the Seven Sages. It was  the sentiment of some person with sinister motives or selfish ambition,  or who regarded everything as it affected his own supremacy. How can a  man be friends with another, if he thinks it possible that he may be his  enemy? Why, it will follow that he must wish and desire his friend  to commit as many mistakes as possible, that he may have all the  more handles against him; and, conversely, that he must be annoyed,  irritated, and jealous at the right actions or good fortune of his  friends. This maxim, then, let it be whose it will, is the utter  destruction of friendship. The true rule is to take such care in the  selection of our friends as never to enter upon a friendship with a man  whom we could under any circumstances come to hate. And even if we are  unlucky in our choice, we must put up with it--according to Scipio--in  preference to making calculations as to a future breach.    17. The real limit to be observed in friendship is this: the characters  of two friends must be stainless. There must be complete harmony of  interests, purpose, and aims, without exception. Then if the case arises  of a friend's wish (not strictly right in itself) calling for support in  a matter involving his life or reputation, we must make some concession  from the straight path--on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28126"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, April, 1880 (#6)"],[1,"might come. Recognizing the apparent discrepancies  between its interpretations of revealed truth and the discoveries of  science, it has always expected that satisfactory explanations and  reconciliations would ensue, _and in this it has not been disappointed_.\"  Will all who read these lines take notice that Mr. Draper takes the  Christian's side in the above statement. \"_In this it has not been  disappointed._\" In what? Answer--Its expectation that satisfactory  explanations and reconciliations would follow the discoveries of science,  by means of which apparent discrepancies between the church's  interpretations of revealed truth and the discoveries of science would  disappear. Mr. Draper adds, \"It would have been well for modern  civilization if the Roman church had done the same.\" He guards his readers  by the following: \"In speaking of Christianity, reference is generally  made to the Roman church, partly because its adherents compose the  majority of Christendom, partly because its demands are the most  pretentious, and partly because it has commonly sought to enforce those  demands by the civil power. None of the protestant churches have ever  occupied a position so imperious, none have ever had such widespread  political influence. For the most part they have been averse to  constraint, and except in very few instances their opposition has not  passed beyond the exciting of theological odium.\" Preface, pp. 10, 11.    On pages 215 and 216, speaking upon the great question of the proper  relations of Christianity and science, Mr. Draper says: \"In the annals of  Christianity the most ill-omened day is that in which she separated  herself from science. She compelled Origen, at that time (A. D. 231) its  chief representative and supporter in the church, to abandon his charge in  Alexandria and retire to Caesarea. In vain through many subsequent  centuries did her leading men spend themselves in, as the phrase then  went, 'drawing forth the internal juice and marrow of the scriptures for  the explaining of things.' Universal history from the _third_ to the  _sixteenth_ century shows with what result. The dark ages owe their  darkness to this fatal policy.\"    The pure Christianity, as well as Christians of 231 years, are exonerated  by Mr. Draper. Unbeliever, will you remember this? Many unbelievers, like  drowning men catching at straws, have endeavored to make it appear that  Mr. Draper's book, entitled \"Conflict Between Religion and Science,\" makes  a square fight between the Bible and science. So far is this from the  truth that, on the contrary, it does not even set up a square issue  between Protestantism and science; its issue lies between Roman Catholic  religion and science. Hear him: \"Then has it, _in truth_, come to this,  that Roman Christianity and science are recognized by their respective  adherents as being absolutely incompatible; they can not exist together;  one must yield to the other; mankind must make its choice--it can not have  both. While such is, perhaps, the issue as regards Catholicism, a  reconciliation of the reformation with science is not only possible, but  would easily take place if the protestant churches would only live up to  their maxim taught by Luther and established by so many years of war. That  maxim is the right of private interpretation of the scriptures. It was the  foundation of intellectual liberty.\" (Did Luther say the foundation of  intellectual liberty?) But if a personal interpretation of the book of  Revelation is permissible, how can it be denied in the case of the book of  nature? In the misunderstandings that have taken place, we must ever bear  in mind the infirmities of men. The generations that immediately followed  the reformation may perhaps be excused for not comprehending the full  significance of cardinal principle, and for not on all occasions carrying  it into effect. When Calvin caused Servetus to be burnt he was animated,  not by the principles of the reformation, but by those of Catholicism,  from which he had not been able to emancipate himself completely. And when  the clergy of influential protestant confessions have stigmatized the  investigators of nature as infidels and atheists, the same may be said.  (No man should be called by a name that does not truthfully represent  him.) Now listen to Mr. Draper: \"For Catholicism to reconcile itself to  science, there are formidable, perhaps insuperable obstacles in the way.  For protestantism to achieve that great result there are not.\"--_Conflict  Between Religion and Science_, pp. 363, 364. Thus Draper speaks for  himself.            FACTS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS, OR WHAT CHRISTIANITY HAS DONE FOR  CANNIBALS.      The Fijians, a quarter of a century ago, were noted for cannibalism. The  following scrap of history may be of importance as a shadow to contrast  with the sunshine. It is taken from Wood's History of the Uncivilized  Races:    The Fijians are more devoted to cannibalism than the New Zealanders, and  their records are still more appalling. A New Zealander has sometimes the  grace to feel ashamed of mentioning the subject in the hearing of an  European, whereas it is impossible to make a Fijian really feel that in  eating human flesh he has committed an unworthy act. He sees, indeed, that  the white man exhibits great disgust at cannibalism, but in his heart he  despises him for wasting such luxurious food as human flesh.... The  natives are clever enough at concealing the existence of cannibalism when  they find that it shocks the white men. An European cotton grower, who had  tried unsuccessfully to introduce the culture of cotton into Fiji, found,  after a tolerable long residence, that four or five human beings were  killed and eaten weekly. There was plenty of food in the place, pigs were  numerous, and fish, fruit and vegetables abundant. But the people ate  human bodies as often as they could get them, not from any superstitious  motive, but simply because they preferred human flesh to pork.... Many of  the people actually take a pride in the number of human bodies which they  have eaten. One chief was looked upon with great respect on account of his  feats of cannibalism, and the people gave him a title of honor. They  called him the Turtle-pond, comparing his insatiable stomach to the pond  in which turtles are kept; and so proud were they of his deeds, that they  even gave a name of honor to the bodies brought for his consumption,  calling them the \"Contents of the Turtle-pond.\" ... One man gained a great  name among his people by an act of peculiar atrocity. He told his wife to  build an oven, to fetch firewood for heating it, and to prepare a bamboo  knife. As soon as she had concluded her labors her husband killed her, and  baked her in the oven which her own hands had prepared, and afterward ate  her. Sometimes a man has been known to take a victim, bind him hand and  foot, cut slices from his arms and legs, and eat them before his eyes.  Indeed, the Fijians are so inordinately vain that they will do anything,  no matter how horrible, in order to gain a name among their people; and  Dr. Pritchard, who knows them thoroughly, expresses his wonder that some  chief did not eat slices from his own limbs.    \"Cannibalism is ingrained in the very nature of the Fijian, and extends  through all classes of society. It is true that there are some persons who  have never eaten human flesh, but there is always a reason for it. Women,  for example, are seldom known to eat 'bakolo,' as human flesh is termed,  and there are a few men who have refrained from cannibalism through  superstition. Every Fijian has his special god, who is supposed to have  his residence in some animal. One god, for example, lives in a rat,  another in a shark, and so on. The worshiper of that god never eats the  animal in which his divinity resides, and as some gods are supposed to  reside in human beings, their worshipers never eat the flesh of man.\"    Recent History Of The Same People In Brief.    \"In the Fiji islands, where half a century ago the favorite dish of food  was human flesh, there are at present eight hundred and forty-one chapels,  and two hundred and ninety-one other places where preaching is held, with  fifty-eight missionaries busily engaged in preparing the way for others.  The membership numbers twenty-three thousand two hundred and seventy-four  persons.\" _The Evangelist of January 29, 1880._ It is possible that some  infidel might have been literally eaten up had it not been for the  influence of the Bible. \"According to the accounts of some of the older  chiefs, whom we may believe or not as we like, there was once a time when  cannibalism did not exist. Many years ago some strangers from a distant  land were blown upon the shores of Fiji, and received hospitably by the  islanders, who incorporated them into their own tribes, and made much of  them. But, in process of time, these people became too powerful, killed  the Fijian chiefs, took their wives and property, and usurped their  office.\"    In the emergency the people consulted the priests, who said that the  Fijians had brought their misfortunes upon themselves. They had allowed  strangers to live, whereas \"Fiji for the Fijians\" was the golden rule, and  from that time every male stranger was to be killed and eaten, and every  woman taken as a wife. The only people free from this law were the  Tongans.    The state of the Fijians is wonderfully changed--even an American infidel  may now visit those people without being flayed and roasted and devoured.    \"The Samoan islands have been entirely christianized. Out of a population  of forty thousand, thirty-five thousand are connected with Christian  churches.    \"In 1830 the native Christians in India, Burmah, and North and South  Ceylon numbered 57,000. Last October there were 460,000. Facts similar in  character might be given of Madagascar, South Africa and Japan.\""]]]
