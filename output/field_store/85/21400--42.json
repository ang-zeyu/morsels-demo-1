XIII. In the Assembly 1596, the Church complained upon the Chancelour his  retention of their registers, & desired they might be delivered to their  Clerk, which accordingly was done; as a memorandum before the beginning of  the first book, bearing the redeliverie of these foure books to _Master  James Richie_, clerk proporteth; which clearly evinceth that those foure  books are the registers of the Assembly.    XIV. The said fifth book and greatest Volume, is also marked on the  margine, with the hand-writ of the said _Master James Carmichell_; (which  is cognosced) who was appointed to peruse the books of the Assembly as  said is, and would not have margined the same by vertue of that command,  nor extracted the general acts out of it, if it were not an approbation  therof, as an authentick and famous book.    XV. The said fifth Volume doth agree with the other foure books; in all  which is extant in them, and marketh the blanks, which are lacerate and  riven out of the same; and compleateth all what is lacking in them.    XVI. In the book of Discipline pertaining to _Master James Carmichel_,  superscribed by himself, and _Master James Richie_, there are sundry acts  and passages quoted out of the said fifth great Volume, saying, It is  written in such a page of the book of the Assembly, which agreeth in  subject and quotation with the said fifth book, and cannot agree with any  other; so that _Master James Carmichel_ reviser of the Assembly books, by  their command, would not alledge that book, nor denominate the same a book  of the Assembly, if it were not an authentick famous book.    XVII. Though the corrupt nature of man hath been tempted to falsifie  particular evidents, yet it hath never been heard that any whole register  hath ever been counterfeited; neither can it bee presupposed that any will  attempt that high wickednesse, seeing the inducements anwerable to that  crime, can hardly be presupposed.    XVIII. It is certain, and notour to all these who are intrusted with the  keeping of the publick records of the Kingdome, that the same are never  subscribed by the Clerk, but only written and filled up by servants, and  most frequently by unknown hands, yet they and the extracts thereof make  publick faith, and the same are uncontrovertedly authentick registers; and  when the most publick registers of the Kingdom shall be seen, and compared  with these registers of the Assembly, it shall be found that these other  registers of the most soveraigne judicatories ever unsubscribed are more  incorrect, oftner margined, scored, and interlined, made up by greater  diversitie of unknown hand writs, than these books of the Assembly, which  by special providence are preserved so intire, that in the judgement of  any man acquainted with registers, they will manifestly appear at the very  sight to be true, famous, and authentick.    XIX. The fame and credit of ancient registers in this Kingdome, is so much  reverenced that if any extract be different or discontinuous from the  register, that extract albeit subscribed by the person who for the time  had been of greatest eminence in the trust of registers, will be  rectified, conform to the register, and have no force, so far as it  debordeth therefrom; although the registers be written with an obscure,  unknown hand, and unsubscribed.          Act. Sess. 12. December fourth.        _The six late pretended Assemblies condemned._      Anent the report of the Committie, for trying the six last pretended  Assemblies: They produced in writ sundrie reasons, clearing the  unlawfulnesse and nullitie of these Assemblies; which were confirmed by  the registers of the Assembly, the books of Presbyteries, the Kings  Majesties own letters, and by the testimonie of divers old reverend  Ministers, standing up in the Assembly, and verifying the truth thereof.  The Assembly with the universall consent of all, after the serious  examination of the reasons against every one of these six pretended  Assemblies apart, being often urged by the Moderatour, to informe  themselves thoroughly, that without doubting, and with a full perswasion  of minde, they might give their voices, declared all these six Assemblies  of _Linlithgow_ 1606. and 1608, _Glasgow_ 1610, _Aberdeen_ 1616, St.  _Andrews_ 1617, _Perth_ 1618. And every one of them to have been from the  beginning unfree, unlawfull, and null Assemblies, and never to have had,  nor hereafter to have any Ecclesiasticall authoritie, and their  conclusions to have been, and to bee of no force, vigour, nor efficacie:  Prohibited all defence and observance of them, and ordained the reasons of  their nullitie to be insert in the books of the Assembly: _Whereof the  tennour followeth._        _Reasons annulling the pretended Assembly, holden at_ Linlithgow, 1606.      I. From the indiction of it. It was indicted the third of _December_ to  bee kept the tenth of _December_. And so there was no time given to the  Presbyteries, far distant, neither for election of Commissioners nor for  preparation to those who were to be sent in Commission. The shortnesse of  the time of the indiction is proved by the Presbyterie books of  _Edinburgh_, _Perth_, and _Hadingtonn_, &c.    II. From the want of a lawfull calling, to these who went to the meeting,  seeing they were not at all elected by their Presbyteries, but were  injoyned to come by the Kings letters. This also is proved by the  foresaids books of the Presbyteries, and by his Majesties letters.    III. From the nature of that meeting, which was only a private meeting, or  convention, for consultation to be taken by some persons of sundry estates  written for, as the Kings letters and the Presbyterie books do  acknowledge.    IV. From the power of those ministers who were present. Their Presbyteries  did limitate them: First, That they should give no suffrages in that  meeting as a generall Assembly. Secondly, That they agree to nothing that  may any wayes be prejudiciall to the acts of the generall Assemblies, or  to the established discipline of the Kirk. Thirdly, That they should not  agree to resolve or conclude any question, article, or mater whatsoever,  the decision whereof is pertinent, and proper to a free generall Assembly.  Fourthly, If any thing be concluded contrary thereunto, that they protest  against it. These limitations are clear by the Presbyterie books.    V. The acts of this meeting were not insert in the book of Assemblies, as  is evident by the register.    VI. The next pretended Assembly at _Linlithgow_, 1608, doth acknowledge  the Assembly, Whereof _Master Patrick Galloway_ was Moderatour, to have  been the last immediate Assembly, preceding it selfe: and that Assembly  whereof he was moderatour, was the Assembly holden at _Halyroodhouse_,  1602. So they did not acknowledge that meeting at _Linlithgow_, 1606. for  any Assembly at all. This is clear by the registers of the Assembly, 1608,  in the entrie thereof.        _Reasons for annulling the pretended Assembly at_ Linlithgow, 1608.      I. Manie of the voters in that pretended Assembly had no lawfull  commission from the Kirk, to wit, 42 Noble men, officers of state,  councellours, and Barrons, also the Bishops, contrare to the act of  _Dundie_, 1597. And one of their caveats, the Noble men, were as  commissioners from the King, the Bishops had no commission at all from the  Presbyterie, for every Presbyterie out of which they came, had their full  number of Commissioners beside them, as the register of the Assembly  beareth.    II. In a lawfull Assembly there should be none but Commissioners from  Presbyteries, Burghs, and Universities, and but three ministers at most,  with one Elder, Commissioners from every Presbyterie, according to the act  made at _Dundie_, 1597. But in that pretended Assembly, there were foure  ministers from the severall Presbyteries, of _Edinburgh_, and _Cowper_,  five from the Presbyteries of _Arbroth_, as the roll of the said pretended  Assembly beareth, whereas there were no ruling Elders sent from  Presbyteries, according to the book of policie and act of _Dundie_.        _Reasons for annulling the pretended Assembly at_ Glasgow, 1610.      I. The Commission of the pretended Commissioners to the meeting was null.  1. Because the election of them was not free, seeing they were nominate by  the Kings Letters, as the Presbyterie books of _Edinburgh, Perth_, and  _Hadingtoun_ declare. And the Bishop of St. _Andrews_ in his letter to  some Presbyteries required them to send such commissioners as the King had  nominate: assuring them, that none other would be accepted. This the  Bishops letter registered in the Presbyterie books of _Hadingtoun_ doth  cleare. 2. And whereas there were no ruling Elders sent from the  Presbyteries to that pretended Assembly, as the roll of Commissioners  sheweth; yet there were moe ministers from undue severall Presbyteries  then three, as five from _Brechen_, five from _Arbroth_, five from  _Kirkenbright_, seven from the Presbytery of _Argyl_, foure from the  Presbyterie of _Cowper_, foure from _Linlithgow_, foure from _Pasley_,  foure from _Hammilton_, foure from _Drumfreis_, foure from _Dunkell_: as  the register of that Assembly beareth.    II. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#6)"],[1,"garrisons or entirely without  shelter, and unaccustomed to caring for their own health, the blacks who  were searching for freedom fell an easy prey to ordinary diseases and to  epidemics. Poor health conditions prevailed for several years longer. In  1870, Robert Somers remarked that \"the health of the whites has greatly  improved since the war, while the health of the Negroes has declined  till the mortality of the colored population, greater than the mortality  of the whites was before the war, has now become so markedly greater,  that nearly two colored die for every white person out of equal numbers  of each.\"    Morals and manners also suffered under the new dispensation. In the  crowded and disease-stricken towns and camps, the conditions under which  the roving Negroes lived were no better for morals than for health,  for here there were none of the restraints to which the blacks had  been accustomed and which they now despised as being a part of their  servitude. But in spite of all the relief that could be given there was  much want. In fact, to restore former conditions the relief agencies  frequently cut off supplies in order to force the Negroes back to work  and to prevent others from leaving the country for the towns. But  the hungry freedmen turned to the nearest food supply, and \"spilin de  gypshuns\" (despoiling the Egyptians, as the Negroes called stealing from  the whites) became an approved means of support. Thefts of hogs, cattle,  poultry, field crops, and vegetables drove almost to desperation those  whites who lived in the vicinity of the Negro camps. When the ex-slave  felt obliged to go to town, he was likely to take with him a team and  wagon and his master's clothes if he could get them.    The former good manners of the Negro were now replaced by impudence and  distrust. There were advisers among the Negro troops and other agitators  who assured them that politeness to whites was a mark of servitude.  Pushing and crowding in public places, on street cars and on the  sidewalks, and impudent speeches everywhere marked generally the limit  of rudeness. And the Negroes were, in this respect, perhaps no worse  than those European immigrants who act upon the principle that bad  manners are a proof of independence.    The year following emancipation was one of religious excitement for  large numbers of the blacks. Before 1865, the Negro church members were  attached to white congregations or were organized into missions, with  nearly always a white minister in charge and a black assistant. With the  coming of freedom the races very soon separated in religious matters.  For this there were two principal reasons: the Negro preachers could  exercise more influence in independent churches; and new church  organizations from the North were seeking Negro membership. Sometimes  Negro members were urged to insist on the right \"to sit together\" with  the whites. In a Richmond church a Negro from the street pushed his way  to the communion altar and knelt. There was a noticeable pause; then  General Robert E. Lee went forward and knelt beside the Negro; and the  congregation followed his example. But this was a solitary instance.  When the race issue was raised by either color, the church membership  usually divided. There was much churchgoing by the Negroes, day and  night, and church festivities and baptisms were common. The blacks  preferred immersion and, wanted a new baptism each time they changed  to a new church. Baptizings in ponds, creeks, or rivers were great  occasions and were largely attended. \"Shouting\" the candidates went into  the water and \"shouting\" they came out. One old woman came up screaming,  \"Freed from slavery! freed from sin! Bless God and General Grant!\"    In the effort to realize their new-found freedom, the Negroes were  heavily handicapped by their extreme poverty and their ignorance. The  total value of free Negro property ran up into the millions in 1860,  but the majority of the Negroes had nothing. There were a few educated  Negroes in the South, and more in the North and in Canada, but the mass  of the race was too densely ignorant to furnish its own leadership. The  case, however, was not hopeless; the Negro was able to work and in large  territories had little competition; wages were high, even though paid  in shares of the crop; the cost of living was low; and land was cheap.  Thousands seemed thirsty for an education and crowded the schools which  were available. It was too much, however, to expect the Negro to take  immediate advantage of his opportunities. What he wanted was a long  holiday, a gun and a dog, and plenty of hunting and fishing. He must  have Saturday at least for a trip to town or to a picnic or a circus; he  did not wish to be a servant. When he had any money, swindlers reaped  a harvest. They sold him worthless finery, cheap guns, preparations to  bleach the skin or straighten the hair, and striped pegs which, when set  up on the master's plantation, would entitle the purchaser to \"40 acres  and a mule.\"    The attitude of the Negroes' employers not infrequently complicated the  situation which they sought to better. The old masters were, as a rule,  skeptical of the value of free Negro labor. Carl Schurz thought this  attitude boded ill for the future: \"A belief, conviction, or prejudice,  or whatever you may call it,\" he said, \"so widely spread and apparently  deeply rooted as this, that the Negro will not work without physical  compulsion, is certainly calculated to have a very serious influence  upon the conduct of the people entertaining it. It naturally produced a  desire to preserve slavery in its original form as much and as long as  possible... or to introduce into the new system that element of physical  compulsion which would make the Negro work.\" The Negro wished to be free  to leave his job when he pleased, but, as Benjamin C. Truman stated in  his report to President Johnson, a \"result of the settled belief in the  Negro's inferiority, and in the necessity that he should not be left to  himself without a guardian, is that in some sections he is discouraged  from leaving his old master. I have known of planters who considered it  an offence against neighborhood courtesy for another to hire their old  hands, and in two instances that were reported the disputants came to  blows over the breach of etiquette.\" The new Freedmen's Bureau insisted  upon written contracts, except for day laborers, and this undoubtedly  kept many Negroes from working regularly, for they were suspicious of  contracts. Besides, the agitators and the Negro troops led them to  hope for an eventual distribution of property. An Alabama planter thus  described the situation in December 1865:    \"They will not work for anything but wages, and few are able to pay  wages. They are penniless but resolute in their demands. They expect to  see all the land divided out equally between them and their old masters  in time to make the next crop. One of the most intelligent black men I  know told me that in a neighboring village, where several hundred  blacks were congregated, he does not think that as many as three made  contracts, although planters are urgent in their solicitations and  offering highest prices for labor they can possibly afford to pay. The  same man informed me that the impression widely prevails that Congress  is about to divide out the lands, and that this impression is given  out by Federal soldiers at the nearest military station. It cannot be  disguised that in spite of the most earnest efforts of their old master  to conciliate and satisfy them, the estrangement between races increases  in its extent and bitterness. Nearly all the Negro men are armed with  repeaters, and many of them carry them openly, day and night.\"    The relations between the races were better, however, than conditions  seemed to indicate. The whites of the Black Belt were better disposed  toward the Negroes than were those of the white districts. It was in the  towns and villages that most of the race conflicts occurred. All  whites agreed that the Negro was inferior, but there were many who were  grateful for his conduct during the war and who wished him well. But  others, the policemen of the towns, the \"loyalists,\" those who had  little but pride of race and the vote to distinguish them from the  blacks, felt no good will toward the ex-slaves. It was Truman's opinion  \"not only that the planters are far better friends to the Negroes than  the poor whites, but also better than a majority of the Northern men  who go South to rent plantations.\" John T. Trowbridge, the novelist, who  recorded his impressions of the South after a visit in 1865, was of the  opinion that the Unionists \"do not like niggers.\" \"For there is,\"  he said, \"more prejudice against color among the middle and poorer  classes--the Union men of the South who owned few or no slaves--than  among the planters who owned them by scores and hundreds.\" The reports  of the Freedmen's Bureau are to the same effect. A Bureau agent in  Tennessee testified: \"An old citizen, a Union man, said to me, said  he, 'I tell you what, if you take away the military from Tennessee, the  buzzards can't eat up the niggers as fast as we'll kill them.'\"    The lawlessness of the Negroes in parts of the Black Belt and the  disturbing influences of the black troops, of some officials of the  Bureau, and of some of the missionary teachers and preachers, caused the  whites to fear insurrections and to take measures for protection. Secret  semi-military organizations were formed which later developed into the  Ku Klux orders. When, however, New Year's Day 1866 passed without the  hoped-for distribution of Property, the Negroes began to settle down.    At the beginning of the period of reconstruction, it seemed possible  that the Negro race might speedily fall into distinct economic groups,  for there were some who had property and"]]]
