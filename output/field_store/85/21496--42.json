The girl walked up to her mother and hurled the filth in her mother's  face.    \"There,\" she cried, \"you who forsake your helpless children and forget  your husband, take that!\"    And at once her mother became a hideous old woman.    The girl then went back to the lodge of the old woman, leaving the camp  in an uproar. The chief soon sent some young warriors to seize the girl  and her brother, and they were brought to his tent. He was furious with  anger.    \"Let the children be bound with lariats wrapped about their bodies and  let them be left to starve. Our camp will move on,\" he said. The chief's  son did not put away his wife, hoping she might be cured in some way and  grow young again.    Everybody in camp now got ready to move; but the old woman came close to  the girl and said:    \"In my old tepee I have dug a hole and buried a pot with punk and steel  and flint and packs of dried meat. They will tie you up like a corpse.  But before we go I will come with a knife and pretend to stab you, but  I will really cut the rope that binds you so that you can unwind it from  your body as soon as the camp is out of sight and hearing.\"    And so, before the camp started, the old woman came to the place where  the two children were bound. She had in her hand a knife bound to the  end of a stick which she used as a lance. She stood over the children  and cried aloud:    \"You wicked girl, who have shamed your own mother, you deserve all the  punishment that is given you. But after all I do not want to let you lie  and starve. Far better kill you at once and have done with it!\" and  with her stick she stabbed many times, as if to kill, but she was really  cutting the rope.    The camp moved on; but the children lay on the ground until noon the  next day. Then they began to squirm about. Soon the girl was free, and  she then set loose her little brother. They went at once to the old  woman's hut where they found the flint and steel and the packs of dried  meat.    The girl made her brother a bow and arrows and with these he killed  birds and other small game.    The boy grew up a great hunter. They became rich. They built three great  tepees, in one of which were stored rows upon rows of parfleche bags of  dried meat.    One day as the brother went out to hunt, he met a handsome young  stranger who greeted him and said to him:    \"I know you are a good hunter, for I have been watching you; your  sister, too, is industrious. Let me have her for a wife. Then you and I  will be brothers and hunt together.\"    The girl's brother went home and told her what the young stranger had  said.    \"Brother, I do not care to marry,\" she answered. \"I am now happy with  you.\"    \"But you will be yet happier married,\" he answered, \"and the young  stranger is of no mean family, as one can see by his dress and manners.\"    \"Very well, I will do as you wish,\" she said. So the stranger came into  the tepee and was the girl's husband.    One day as they were in their tent, a crow flew overhead, calling out  loudly,              \"Kaw, Kaw,    \"They who forsook the children have no meat.\"    The girl and her husband and brother looked up at one another.    \"What can it mean?\" they asked. \"Let us send for Unktomi (the spider).  He is a good judge and he will know.\"    \"And I will get ready a good dinner for him, for Unktomi is always  hungry,\" added the young wife.    When Unktomi came, his yellow mouth opened with delight at the fine  feast spread for him. After he had eaten he was told what the crow had  said.    \"The crow means,\" said Unktomi, \"that the villagers and chief who bound  and deserted you are in sad plight. They have hardly anything to eat and  are starving.\"    When the girl heard this she made a bundle of choicest meat and called  the crow.    \"Take this to the starving villagers,\" she bade him.    He took the bundle in his beak, flew away to the starving village and  dropped the bundle before the chief's tepee. The chief came out and the  crow called loudly:    \"Kaw, Kaw!    \"The children who were forsaken have much meat; those who forsook them  have none.\"    \"What can he mean,\" cried the astonished villagers.    \"Let us send for Unktomi,\" said one, \"he is a great judge; he will tell  us.\"    They divided the bundle of meat among the starving people, saving the  biggest piece for Unktomi.    When Unktomi had come and eaten, the villagers told him of the crow and  asked what the bird's words meant.    \"He means,\" said Unktomi, \"that the two children whom you forsook have  tepees full of dried meat enough for all the village.\"    The villagers were filled with astonishment at this news. To find  whether or not it was true, the chief called seven young men and sent  them out to see. They came to the three tepees and there met the girl's  brother and husband just going out to hunt (which they did now only for  sport).    The girl's brother invited the seven young men into the third or sacred  lodge, and after they had smoked a pipe and knocked out the ashes on a  buffalo bone the brother gave them meat to eat, which the seven devoured  greedily. The next day he loaded all seven with packs of meat, saying:    \"Take this meat to the villagers and lead them hither.\"    While they awaited the return of the young men with the villagers, the  girl made two bundles of meat, one of the best and choicest pieces, and  the other of liver, very dry and hard to eat. After a few days the camp  arrived. The young woman's mother opened the door and ran in crying:  \"Oh, my dear daughter, how glad I am to see you.\" But the daughter  received her coldly and gave her the bundle of dried liver to eat. But  when the old woman who had saved the children's lives came in, the  young girl received her gladly, called her grandmother, and gave her the  package of choice meat with marrow.    Then the whole village camped and ate of the stores of meat all the  winter until spring came; and withal they were so many, there was such  abundance of stores that there was still much left.              THE SIGNS OF CORN    When corn is to be planted by the Indians, it is the work of the women  folk to see to the sorting and cleaning of the best seed. It is also the  women's work to see to the planting. (This was in olden times.)    After the best seed has been selected, the planter measures the corn,  lays down a layer of hay, then a layer of corn. Over this corn they  sprinkle warm water and cover it with another layer of hay, then bind  hay about the bundle and hang it up in a spot where the warm rays of the  sun can strike it.    While the corn is hanging in the sun, the ground is being prepared to  receive it. Having finished the task of preparing the ground, the woman  takes down her seed corn which has by this time sprouted. Then she  proceeds to plant the corn.    Before she plants the first hill, she extends her hoe heavenwards and  asks the Great Spirit to bless her work, that she may have a good yield.  After her prayer she takes four kernels and plants one at the north,  one at the south, one at the east and one at the west sides of the first  hill. This is asking the Great Spirit to give summer rain and sunshine  to bring forth a good crop.    For different growths of the corn, the women have an interpretation as  to the character of the one who planted it.    1st. Where the corn grows in straight rows and the cob is full of  kernels to the end, this signifies that the planter of this corn is of  an exemplary character, and is very truthful and thoughtful.    2nd. If the rows on the ears of corn are irregular and broken, the  planter is considered careless and unthoughtful. Also disorderly and  slovenly about her house and person.    3rd. When an ear of corn bears a few scattering kernels with spaces  producing no corn, it is said that is a good sign that the planter will  live to a ripe old age. So old will they be that like the corn, their  teeth will be few and far between.    4th. When a stalk bears a great many nubbins, or small ears growing  around the large one, it is a sign that the planter is from a large and  respectable family.    After the corn is gathered, it is boiled into sweet corn and made into  hominy; parched and mixed with buffalo tallow and rolled into round  balls, and used at feasts, or carried by the warriors on the warpath as  food.    When there has been a good crop of corn, an ear is always tied at the  top of the medicine pole, of the sun dance, in thanks to the Great  Spirit for his goodness to them in sending a bountiful crop.              STORY OF THE RABBITS    The Rabbit nation were very much depressed in spirits on account of  being run over by all other nations. They, being very obedient to their  chief, obeyed all his orders to the letter. One of his orders was,  that upon the approach of any other nation that they should follow the  example of their chief and run up among the rocks and down into their  burrows, and not show themselves until the strangers had passed.    This they always did. Even the chirp of a little cricket would send them  all scampering to their dens.    One day they held a great council, and after talking over everything for  some time, finally left it to their medicine man to decide. The medicine  man arose and said:    \"My friends, we are of no use on this earth. There isn't a nation  on earth that fears us, and we are so timid that we cannot defend  ourselves, so the best thing for us to do is to rid the earth of our  nation, by all going over to the big lake and drowning ourselves.\"    This they decided to do; so going to the lake they were about to jump  in, when they heard a splashing in the water. Looking, they saw a lot of  frogs jumping into the lake.    \"We will not drown ourselves,\" said the medicine man, \"we have found a  nation who are afraid of us. It is the frog nation.\" Had it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3410"],[0,"The American Spirit in Literature: A Chronicle of Great Interpreters (#6)"],[1,"ulogy, are flourishing. The reader is reminded of that  epoch, one hundred and fifty years later, when the deaths of John Adams  and of Thomas Jefferson, falling upon the same anniversary day, the  Fourth of July, 1826, stirred all Americans to a fresh recognition of  the services wrought by the Fathers of the Republic. So it was in the  colonies at the close of the seventeenth century. Old England, in one  final paroxysm of political disgust, cast out the last Stuart in 1688.  That Revolution marks, as we have seen, the close of a long and tragic  struggle which began in the autocratic theories of James the First  and in the absolutism of Charles. Almost every phase of that momentous  conflict had its reverberation across the Atlantic, as the history of  the granting and withdrawal of colonial charters witnesses abundantly.  The American pioneers were quite aware of what was going on in England,  and they praised God or grumbled, thriftily profited by the results or  quietly nullified them, as the case might be. But all the time, while  England was rocked to its foundations, the colonists struck steadily  forward into their own independent life.        CHAPTER III. THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION    When the eighteenth century opened, many signs of change were in  the air. The third generation of native-born Americans was becoming  secularized. The theocracy of New England had failed. In the height  of the tragic folly over the supposed \"witchcraft\" in Salem, Increase  Mather and his son Cotton had held up the hands of the judges in their  implacable work. But before five years had passed, Judge Sewall does  public penance in church for his share of the awful blunder, desiring  \"to take the shame and blame of it.\" Robert Calef's cool pamphlet  exposing the weakness of the prosecutors' case is indeed burned by  Increase Mather in the Harvard Yard, but the liberal party are soon to  force Mather from the Presidency and to refuse that office to his son.  In the town of Boston, once hermetically sealed against heresy, there  are Baptist and Episcopal churches--and a dancing-master. Young Benjamin  Franklin, born in 1706, professes a high respect for the Mathers, but he  does not go to church, \"Sunday being my studying day,\" and neither the  clerical nor the secular arm of Boston is long enough and strong enough  to compel that industrious apprentice into piety.    If such was the state of New England, the laxity of New York and  Virginia needs little evidence. Contemporary travelers found the  New Yorkers singularly attached to the things of this present world.  Philadelphia was prosperous and therewith content. Virginia was a  paradise with no forbidden fruit. Hugh Jones, writing of it in 1724,  considers North Carolina \"the refuge of runaways,\" and South Carolina  \"the delight of buccaneers and pirates,\" but Virginia \"the happy retreat  of true Britons and true Churchmen.\" Unluckily these Virginians, well  nourished \"by the plenty of the country,\" have \"contemptible notions  of England!\" We shall hear from them again. In the meantime the witty  William Byrd of Westover describes for us his amusing survey of the  Dismal Swamp, and his excursions into North Carolina and to Governor  Spotswood's iron mines, where he reads aloud to the Widow Fleming, on  a rainy autumn day, three acts of the \"Beggars' Opera,\" just over from  London. So runs the world away, south of the Potomac. Thackeray paints  it once for all, no doubt, in the opening chapters of \"The Virginians.\"    To discover any ambitious literary effort in this period, we must turn  northward again. In the middle colonies, and especially in Philadelphia,  which had now outgrown Boston in population, there was a quickened  interest in education and science. But the New Englanders were still the  chief makers of books. Three great names will sufficiently represent the  age: Cotton Mather, a prodigy of learning whose eyes turn back fondly  to the provincial past; Jonathan Edwards, perhaps the most consummate  intellect of the eighteenth century; and Benjamin Franklin, certainly  the most perfect exponent of its many-sided life.    When Cotton Mather was graduated from Harvard in 1678, in his sixteenth  year, he was publicly complimented by President Oakes, in fulsome Latin,  as the grandson of Richard Mather and John Cotton. This atmosphere of  flattery, this consciousness of continuing in his own person the famous  local dynasty, surrounded and sustained him to the end. He had a less  commanding personality than his father Increase. His nervous sensibility  was excessive. His natural vanity was never subdued, though it was often  chastened by trial and bitter disappointment. But, like his father, he  was an omnivorous reader and a facile producer of books, carrying daily  such burdens of mental and spiritual excitement as would have crushed a  normal man. Increase Mather published some one hundred and fifty books  and pamphlets: Cotton Mather not less than four hundred. The Rev. John  Norton, in his sketch of John Cotton, remarks that \"the hen, which  brings not forth without uncessant sitting night and day, is an  apt emblem of students.\" Certainly the hen is an apt emblem of the  \"uncessant\" sitter, the credulous scratcher, the fussy cackler who  produced the \"Magnalia.\"    Yet he had certain elements of greatness. His tribal loyalty was  perfect. His ascetic devotion to his conception of religious truth was  absolute. His Diary, which has recently been published in full, records  his concern for the chief political events in Europe in his day, no less  than his brooding solicitude for the welfare of his townspeople, and his  agony of spirit over the lapses of his wayward eldest son. A \"sincere\"  man, then, as Carlyle would say, at bottom; but overlaid with such  \"Jewish old clothes,\" such professional robings and personal plumage  as makes it difficult, save in the revealing \"Diary,\" to see the man  himself.    The \"Magnalia Christi Americana,\" treating the history of New England  from 1620 to 1698, was published in a tall London folio of nearly 800  pages in 1702. It is divided into seven books, and proceeds, by methods  entirely unique, to tell of Pilgrim and Puritan divines and governors,  of Harvard College, of the churches of New England, of marvelous events,  of Indian wars; and in general to justify, as only a member of the  Mather dynasty could justify, the ways of God to Boston men. Hawthorne  and Whittier, Longfellow and Lowell knew this book well and found  much honey in the vast carcass. To have had four such readers and a  biographer like Barrett Wendell must be gratifying to Cotton Mather in  Paradise.    The \"Diary\" of Mather's fellow-townsman Judge Samuel Sewall has been  read more generally in recent years than anything written by Mather  himself. It was begun in 1673, nine years earlier than the first entry  in Mather's \"Diary,\" and it ends in 1729, while Mather's closes in 1724.  As a picture of everyday happenings in New England, Sewall's \"Diary\"  is as far superior to Mather's as Pepys's \"Diary\" is to George Fox's  \"Journal\" in painting the England of the Restoration. Samuel Sewall was  an admirably solid figure, keen, forceful, honest. Most readers of his  \"Diary\" believe that he really was in luck when he was rejected by the  Widow Winthrop on that fateful November day when his eye noted--in spite  of his infatuation--that \"her dress was not so clean as sometime it had  been. Jehovah Jireh!\"    One pictures Cotton Mather as looking instinctively backward to the  Heroic Age of New England with pious nervous exaltation, and Samuel  Sewall as doing the day's work uprightly without taking anxious thought  of either past or future. But Jonathan Edwards is set apart from these  and other men. He is a lonely seeker after spiritual perfection, in  quest of that city \"far on the world's rim,\" as Masefield says of it,  the city whose builder and maker is God.    The story of Edwards's career has the simplicity and dignity of tragedy.  Born in a parsonage in the quiet Connecticut valley in 1703--the year  of John Wesley's birth--he is writing at the age of ten to disprove the  doctrine of the materiality of the soul. At twelve he is studying  \"the wondrous way of the working of the spider,\" with a precision and  enthusiasm which would have made him a great naturalist. At fourteen he  begins his notes on \"The Mind\" and on \"Natural Science.\" He is graduated  from Yale in 1720, studies theology, and at twenty-four becomes the  colleague of his famous grandfather, Solomon Stoddard, in the church  at Northampton. He marries the beautiful Sarah Pierrepont, whom he  describes in his journal in a prose rhapsody which, like his mystical  rhapsodies on religion in the same youthful period, glows with a clear  unearthly beauty unmatched in any English prose of that century. For  twenty-three years he serves the Northampton church, and his sermons win  him the rank of the foremost preacher in New England. John Wesley reads  at Oxford his account of the great revival of 1735. Whitefield comes to  visit him at Northampton. Then, in 1750, the ascetic preacher  alienates his church over issues pertaining to discipline and to the  administration of the sacrament. He is dismissed. He preaches his  \"farewell sermon,\" like Wesley, like Emerson, like Newman, and many  another still unborn. He removes to Stockbridge, then a hamlet in the  wilderness, preaches to the Indians, and writes treatises on theology  and metaphysics, among them the world famous \"Freedom of the Will.\"  In 1757, upon the death of his son-in-law, President Aaron Burr of  Princeton, Edwards is called to the vacant Presidency. He is reluctant  to go, for though he is only fifty-four, his health has never been  robust, and he has his great book on the \"History of Redemption\" still  to write. But he accepts, finds the smallpox raging in Princeton upon  his arrival in January, 1758, is inoculated,"]]]
