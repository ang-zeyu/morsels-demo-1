The king refuses to banish  the woman unheard and decides to visit her.  Ankarstroem tries to  dissuade, but the King insists, and accordingly goes to Arvedson in  disguise.  During the witch's conjuration Malwina, his lady-love  appears, who seeks help from the sorceress against her forbidden  passion.  The concealed King hears Arvedson tell her to go at midnight  and gather a herb, which grows on the graves of criminals, and  triumphant in his knowledge of Malwina's confessed love, Gustavus  decides to follow her there.    When she has gone, he mockingly orders the witch to tell him his  fortune, and hears from her that he shall be killed by the man, who  first tenders him his hand.  Just then Ankarstroem who comes to protect  the King against his enemy, enters and they shake hands.    {17}    In the third act Malwina meets the King on the dismal spot, to which  she had been directed, but Ankarstroem, whose watchful fidelity never  suffers him to be far from the King, and who is utterly ignorant of the  deception being practised upon him, saves the lovers from further  guilt.  After a severe conflict with himself, Gustavus consents to fly  in his friend's cloak, Ankarstroem having pledged his honor not to ask  the veiled lady's secret, and to conduct her safely back to the city.  This plan is frustrated by the conspirators, who rush in and are about  to attack the Count.  Malwina throws herself between him and the  combatants, and the husband then recognizes in the King's companion his  own wife.  Full of indignation he turns from her and joins the  conspirators, promising to be one of them.    He swears to kill his unhappy wife, but not until another has first  fallen.    In the fourth act the conspirators have a meeting in Ankarstroem's  house, where they decide to murder the King.  The lots being cast, the  duty to strike the death-blow falls on Ankarstroem, and Malwina herself  draws the fatal paper.  At this moment an invitation to a masked ball  is brought by the King's page Oscar, and the conspirators resolve to  take advantage of this opportunity for the execution of their design.    In the last act the King, happy to know Malwina safe from discovery,  resolves to sacrifice his love to honor and friendship.  He is about to  give Ankarstroem the proof of his friendship, by naming {18} him  governor of Finland, and the minister is to depart with his wife on the  morning after the ball.  Meanwhile the King is warned by a missive from  an unknown hand, not to appear at the ball, but he disregards it.  He  meets Malwina at the ball.  His page, thinking to do the King a  service, has betrayed his mask to Ankarstroem.  Malwina warns the  prince, but in vain, for while he presents her with the paper, which is  to send her and her husband to their own beloved country, Ankarstroem  shoots him through the heart.  Gustavus dies, pardoning his murderer.          THE BARBER OF BAGDAD.    Comic Opera in two acts by PETER CORNELIUS.      It took a long time, before this charming little Opera took its place  amongst so many fellow operas much less entitled to notice.  The  composer had died 15 years previously, without having gained the  success he so fully deserved, as poet as well as composer.    Liszt, the great redeemer of many a tried genius brought the opera upon  the stage on the 15th of December 1858 in Weimar.    But the Intendant Dingelstedt was against him, the opera proved an  entire failure, though it was meant more as demonstration against Liszt  than against the opera.  Liszt, tired of these disgraceful intrigues,  quitted Weimar, only to return there from time to time in private.  With his abdication {19} Weimar's glorious time was passed.  In 1889 at  last the Barber of Bagdad took its rightful place after many years of  oblivion.    Munich, Mannheim and Vienna came first and the music having been  enthusiastically applauded, Dresden followed the good example in  October 1890.  The music is full of sweet melody, the composition  masterfully set.  Its comic parts are not quite natural, but the lyric  is almost classical and the text, written by the composer himself,  though lacking in action, shows, that Cornelius was a true poet as well  as a true musician.    The scene takes place in Bagdad, in the house of a wealthy young  Mussulman, called Nurredin.  He is lying on a couch, surrounded by his  servants, who think him dying.  But it is only the flame of love which  devours his strength and deprives him of all energy.--As soon as  Bostana, an old relative and companion of his ladylove, appears, in  order to tell him that Margiana, his adored, is willing to receive him,  Nurredin forgets his illness and only longs for the promised interview.  The ensuing duet between him and Bostana, wherein she gives instruction  about time and hour of the rendez-vous, is delightfully fresh and  piquant.    As Nurredin has neglected his personal appearance during his malady,  his first wish is for a barber, who is speedily sent to him by  Bostana.--This old worthy Abul Hassan Ali Ebe Bekar the barber makes  him desperate by his vain prattle.  Having solemnly saluted to  Nurredin, he warns him not to {20} leave the house to-day, as his  horoscope tells him that his life is in danger.  The young man not  heeding him, Abul Hassan begins to enumerate all his talents as  astrologer, philologer, philosopher, &c., in short he is everything and  knows everything.  When Nurredin orders him to begin his shaving he  relates the fate of his six brothers, who all died before him and  always of love.  At last Nurredin's patience giving way, he calls his  servants in to throw the old dotard out of doors.  But Abul drives them  all back and Nurredin tries to pacify him with flattery and finally  succeeds.    Now Abul is curious as all barbers are, and having heard Nurredin's  sighs, he determines to find out all about the young man's love.  This  scene is most ludicrous, when Abul sings his air \"Margiana\", which name  he has heard from Nurredin's lips, and the latter is in despair at  being left with only one side of his head shaved.  This great work done  at last, Abul wants to accompany the young lover to the house of the  Cadi Baba Mustapha, Margiana's father.  Nurredin again summons his  servants, who begin to surround Abul, pretending to doctor him.  Nurredin escapes, but Abul after having shaken off the servants, runs  after him.    The second act takes place in the Cadi's house.    Margiana is full of sweet anticipation, while her father, who has  already chosen a husband for his daughter in the person of an old  friend of his youth, shows her a large trunk full of gifts from the old  bridegroom.  Margiana admires them {21} obediently.  A musical scene of  surpassing beauty follows, where we hear the call of the Muezzin  summoning the faithful to prayer.  It is also the sign for Nurredin to  appear.  The Cadi hurries to the Mosque and Bostana introduces the  lover.  Here ensues a charming love-duet, accompanied, originally  enough, by a song from the old barber, who watches before the house.  Suddenly they are interrupted by cries of alarm, and with dismay they  learn from Bostana, that the Cadi has returned to punish a slave, who  has broken a precious vase.    Nurredin, unable to escape unobserved, is hidden in the big trunk.  Meanwhile Abul, having heard the slave's cries and mistaking them for  Nurredin's, summons the latter's servants and breaks into the Cadi's  house to avenge his young friend, whom he believes to be murdered.  Bostana angrily bids him carry away the trunk signifying to him whom  she has hidden in it, but the Cadi intervenes, believing the servants  to be thieves who want to rob his daughter's treasure.  The rumor of  the murder gradually penetrates the whole town; its inhabitants gather  before the house, and the appointed wailing-women mingle their doleful  lamentations with the general uproar.  At last the Calif himself  appears in order to settle the quarrel.    The Cadi accuses the barber of theft, while Abul calls the Cadi a  murderer.--To throw light upon the matter, the Calif orders the trunk  to be opened, which is done with great hesitation by {22} Margiana.  When the lid gives way Nurredin is lying in it in a deep swoon.  All  are terrified believing him to be murdered, but Abul, caressing him,  declares that his heart still throbs.  The Calif bids the barber show  his art, and Abul wakens Nurredin by the love-song to Margiana.  The  young man revives and the truth dawns upon the deceived father's mind.  The Calif, a very humane and clement prince, feels great sympathy with  the beautiful young couple, and advises the Cadi to let his daughter  have her treasure, because he had told them himself, that it was  Margiana's treasure, kept hidden in the trunk.    The Cadi consents, while the Calif bids the funny barber come to his  palace to entertain him with his stories, and invites all present to  the wedding of the betrothed pair, to the great satisfaction of the  people, who sing their Salam Aleikum in praise of their Prince,--a  brilliant finale, full of energy and melody.--          IL BARBIERE DI SEVIGLIA.    Comic Opera in two acts by ROSSINI.      This opera may be called a miracle of Rossini's creation, as it not  only is his best work, but was written by him in a fortnight, a  performance nearly incredible, for the music is so finely worked out,  and so elegant, that the opera has grown to be a favorite with all  nations.    The subject, taken from Beaumarchais' witty trilogy of \"Figaros\" had  ere this lent inspiration {23} to more than one composer; Mozart's  \"Figaro\", though done before the \"Barbiere\" is in a certain sense the  continuation of Rossini's opera.    The Barbiere had the peculiar misfortune, to experience an utter  reverse on the occasion of its first representation.  It was composed  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2465"],[0,"Carmen (#6)"],[1,"have to go to prison. Those  are my orders, and there's no help for it!'    \"We men from the Basque country have an accent which all Spaniards  easily recognise; on the other hand, not one of them can ever learn to  say _Bai, jaona_!*         * Yes, sir.    \"So Carmen easily guessed I was from the Provinces. You know, sir, that  the gipsies, who belong to no particular country, and are always moving  about, speak every language, and most of them are quite at home in  Portugal, in France, in our Provinces, in Catalonia, or anywhere else.  They can even make themselves understood by Moors and English people.  Carmen knew Basque tolerably well.    \"'_Laguna ene bihotsarena_, comrade of my heart,' said she suddenly. 'Do  you belong to our country?'    \"Our language is so beautiful, sir, that when we hear it in a foreign  country it makes us quiver. I wish,\" added the bandit in a lower tone,  \"I could have a confessor from my own country.\"    After a silence, he began again.    \"'I belong to Elizondo,' I answered in Basque, very much affected by the  sound of my own language.    \"'I come from Etchalar,' said she (that's a district about four hours'  journey from my home). 'I was carried off to Seville by the gipsies.  I was working in the factory to earn enough money to take me back to  Navarre, to my poor old mother, who has no support in the world but me,  besides her little _barratcea_* with twenty cider-apple trees in it.  Ah! if I were only back in my own country, looking up at the white  mountains! I have been insulted here, because I don't belong to this  land of rogues and sellers of rotten oranges; and those hussies are  all banded together against me, because I told them that not all their  Seville _jacques_,** and all their knives, would frighten an honest lad  from our country, with his blue cap and his _maquila_! Good comrade,  won't you do anything to help your own countrywoman?'         * Field, garden.         ** Bravos, boasters.    \"She was lying then, sir, as she has always lied. I don't know that that  girl ever spoke a word of truth in her life, but when she did speak, I  believed her--I couldn't help myself. She mangled her Basque words, and  I believed she came from Navarre. But her eyes and her mouth and her  skin were enough to prove she was a gipsy. I was mad, I paid no more  attention to anything, I thought to myself that if the Spaniards had  dared to speak evil of my country, I would have slashed their faces just  as she had slashed her comrade's. In short, I was like a drunken man, I  was beginning to say foolish things, and I was very near doing them.    \"'If I were to give you a push and you tumbled down, good  fellow-countryman,' she began again in Basque, 'those two Castilian  recruits wouldn't be able to keep me back.'    \"Faith, I forgot my orders, I forgot everything, and I said to her,  'Well, then, my friend, girl of my country, try it, and may our Lady of  the Mountain help you through.'    \"Just at that moment we were passing one of the many narrow lanes one  sees in Seville. All at once Carmen turned and struck me in the chest  with her fist. I tumbled backward, purposely. With a bound she sprang  over me, and ran off, showing us a pair of legs! People talk about a  pair of Basque legs! but hers were far better--as fleet as they were  well-turned. As for me, I picked myself up at once, but I stuck out my  lance* crossways and barred the street, so that my comrades were checked  at the very first moment of pursuit. Then I started to run myself, and  they after me--but how were we to catch her? There was no fear of that,  what with our spurs, our swords, and our lances.         * All Spanish cavalry soldiers carry lances.    \"In less time than I have taken to tell you the story the prisoner  had disappeared. And besides, every gossip in the quarter covered her  flight, poked scorn at us, and pointed us in the wrong direction. After  a good deal of marching and countermarching, we had to go back to the  guard-room without a receipt from the governor of the jail.    \"To avoid punishment, my men made known that Carmen had spoken to me in  Basque; and to tell the truth, it did not seem very natural that a blow  from such a little creature should have so easily overthrown a strong  fellow like me. The whole thing looked suspicious, or, at all events,  not over-clear. When I came off guard I lost my corporal's stripes, and  was condemned to a month's imprisonment. It was the first time I had  been punished since I had been in the service. Farewell, now, to the  sergeant's stripes, on which I had reckoned so surely!    \"The first days in prison were very dreary. When I enlisted I had  fancied I was sure to become an officer, at all events. Two of  my compatriots, Longa and Mina, are captains-general, after all.  Chapalangarra was a colonel, and I have played tennis a score of times  with his brother, who was just a needy fellow like myself. 'Now,' I kept  crying to myself, 'all the time you served without being punished  has been lost. Now you have a bad mark against your name, and to get  yourself back into the officers' good graces you'll have to work ten  times as hard as when you joined as a recruit.' And why have I got  myself punished? For the sake of a gipsy hussy, who made game of me, and  who at this moment is busy thieving in some corner of the town. Yet I  couldn't help thinking about her. Will you believe it, sir, those silk  stockings of hers with the holes in them, of which she had given me such  a full view as she took to her heels, were always before my eyes? I  used to look through the barred windows of the jail into the street,  and among all the women who passed I never could see one to compare with  that minx of a girl--and then, in spite of myself, I used to smell the  acacia blossom she had thrown at me, and which, dry as it was, still  kept its sweet scent. If there are such things as witches, that girl  certainly was one.    \"One day the jailer came in, and gave me an Alcala roll.*         * _Alcala de los Panaderos_, a village two leagues from       Seville, where the most delicious rolls are made. They are       said to owe their quality to the water of the place, and       great quantities of them are brought to Seville every day.    \"'Look here,' said he, 'this is what your cousin has sent you.'    \"I took the loaf, very much astonished, for I had no cousin in Seville.  It may be a mistake, thought I, as I looked at the roll, but it was so  appetizing and smelt so good, that I made up my mind to eat it, without  troubling my head as to whence it came, or for whom it was really  intended.    \"When I tried to cut it, my knife struck on something hard. I looked,  and found a little English file, which had been slipped into the dough  before the roll had been baked. The roll also contained a gold piece of  two piastres. Then I had no further doubt--it was a present from Carmen.  To people of her blood, liberty is everything, and they would set a  town on fire to save themselves one day in prison. The girl was artful,  indeed, and armed with that roll, I might have snapped my fingers at the  jailers. In one hour, with that little file, I could have sawn through  the thickest bar, and with the gold coin I could have exchanged my  soldier's cloak for civilian garb at the nearest shop. You may fancy  that a man who has often taken the eaglets out of their nests in our  cliff would have found no difficulty in getting down to the street  out of a window less than thirty feet above it. But I didn't choose to  escape. I still had a soldier's code of honour, and desertion appeared  to me in the light of a heinous crime. Yet this proof of remembrance  touched me. When a man is in prison he likes to think he has a friend  outside who takes an interest in him. The gold coin did rather offend  me; I should have very much liked to return it; but where was I to find  my creditor? That did not seem a very easy task.    \"After the ceremony of my degradation I had fancied my sufferings were  over, but I had another humiliation before me. That came when I left  prison, and was told off for duty, and put on sentry, as a private  soldier. You can not conceive what a proud man endures at such a moment.  I believe I would have just as soon been shot dead--then I should have  marched alone at the head of my platoon, at all events; I should have  felt I was somebody, with the eyes of others fixed upon me.    \"I was posted as sentry on the door of the colonel's house. The colonel  was a young man, rich, good-natured, fond of amusing himself. All  the young officers were there, and many civilians as well, besides  ladies--actresses, as it was said. For my part, it seemed to me as if  the whole town had agreed to meet at that door, in order to stare at me.  Then up drove the colonel's carriage, with his valet on the box. And who  should I see get out of it, but the gipsy girl! She was dressed up, this  time, to the eyes, togged out in golden ribbons--a spangled gown, blue  shoes, all spangled too, flowers and gold lace all over her. In her hand  she carried a tambourine. With her there were two other gipsy women, one  young and one old. They always have one old woman who goes with them,  and then an old man with a guitar, a gipsy too, to play alone, and also  for their dances. You must know these gipsy girls are often sent for to  private houses, to dance their special dance, the _Romalis_, and often,  too, for quite other purposes.    \"Carmen recognised me, and we exchanged glances. I don't know why, but  at that moment I should have liked to have been a hundred feet beneath  the ground.    \"'_Agur laguna_,'* said she. 'Oficial mio! You keep guard like a  recruit,' and before I could find a word in answer, she was inside the  house.         * Good-day, comrade!    \"The whole party was assembled in the _patio_, and in spite of the crowd  I could see nearly everything that went on"]]]
