The _Atua pow_ or mischievous  gods. 6. _Mooi,_ or the god that supports the earth and does not belong  to Bolotoo (vol. ii. pp. 103, 104).\"    From this it appears that the \"Atuas\" of the Polynesian are exactly  equivalent to the \"Elohim\" of the old Israelite. [20] They comprise  everything spiritual, from a ghost to a god, and from \"the merely  tutelar gods to particular private families\" (vol, ii. p. 104), to  Ta-li-y-Tooboo, who was the national god of Tonga. The Tongans had no  doubt that these Atuas daily and hourly influenced their destinies  and could, conversely, be influenced by them. Hence their \"piety,\" the  incessant acts of sacrificial worship which occupied their lives, and  their belief in omens and charms. Moreover, the Atuas were believed to  visit particular persons,--their own priests in the case of the higher  gods, but apparently anybody in that of the lower,--and to inspire them  by a process which was conceived to involve the actual residence of the  god, for the time being, in the person inspired, who was thus rendered  capable of prophesying (vol. ii. p. 100). For the Tongan, therefore,  inspiration indubitably was possession.    When one of the higher gods was invoked, through his priest, by a chief  who wished to consult the oracle, or, in old Israelitic phraseology,  to \"inquire of,\" the god, a hog was killed and cooked over night, and,  together with plantains, yams, and the materials for making the peculiar  drink _kava_ (of which the Tongans were very fond), was carried next day  to the priest. A circle, as for an ordinary kava-drinking entertainment,  was then formed; but the priest, as the representative of the god,  took the highest place, while the chiefs sat outside the circle, as an  expression of humility calculated to please the god.         As soon as they are all seated the priest is considered as     inspired, the god being supposed to exist within him from that     moment. He remains for a considerable time in silence with his     hands clasped before him, his eyes are cast down and he rests     perfectly still. During the time the victuals are being shared     out and the kava preparing, the matabooles sometimes begin to     consult him; sometimes he answers, and at other times not;     in either case he remains with his eyes cast down. Frequently he     will not utter a word till the repast is finished and the kava     too. When he speaks he generally begins in a low and very     altered tone of voice, which gradually rises to nearly its     natural pitch, though sometimes a little above it. All that he     says is supposed to be the declaration of the god, and he     accordingly speaks in the first person, as if he were the god.     All this is done generally without any apparent inward emotion     or outward agitation; but, on some occasions, his countenance     becomes fierce, and as it were inflamed, and his whole frame     agitated with inward feeling; he is seized with an universal     trembling, the perspiration breaks out on his forehead, and his     lips turning black are convulsed; at length tears start in     floods from his eyes, his breast heaves with great emotion, and     his utterance is choked. These symptoms gradually subside.     Before this paroxysm comes on, and after it is over, he often     eats as much as four hungry men under other circumstances could     devour. The fit being now gone off, he remains for some time     calm and then takes up a club that is placed by him for the     purpose, turns it over and regards it attentively; he then looks     up earnestly, now to the right, now to the left, and now again     at the club; afterwards he looks up again and about him in like     manner, and then again fixes his eyes on the club, and so on for     several times. At length he suddenly raises the club, and, after     a moment's pause, strikes the ground or the adjacent part of the     house with considerable force, immediately the god leaves him,     and he rises up and retires to the back of the ring among the     people (vol. i. pp. 100, 101).    The phenomena thus described, in language which, to any one who is  familiar with the manifestations of abnormal mental states among  ourselves, bears the stamp of fidelity, furnish a most instructive  commentary upon the story of the wise woman of Endor. As in the latter,  we have the possession by the spirit or soul (Atua, Elohim), the strange  voice, the speaking in the first person. Unfortunately nothing (beyond  the loud cry) is mentioned as to the state of the wise woman of Endor.  But what we learn from other sources (_e.g._ 1 Sam. x. 20-24) respecting  the physical concomitants of inspiration among the old Israelites  has its exact equivalent in this and other accounts of Polynesian  prophetism. An excellent authority, Moerenhout, who lived among the  people of the Society Islands many years and knew them well, says that,  in Tahiti, the _role_ of the prophet had very generally passed out of  the hands of the priests into that of private persons who professed  to represent the god, often assumed his name, and in this capacity  prophesied. I will not run the risk of weakening the force of  Moerenhout's description of the prophetic state by translating it:--    \"Un individu, dans cet etat, avait le bras gauche enveloppe d'un morceau  d'etoffe, signe de la presence de la Divinite. Il ne parlait que d'un  ton imperieux et vehement. Ses attaques, quand il allait prophetiser,  etaient aussi effroyables qu'imposantes. Il tremblait d'abord de tous  ses membres, la figure enflee, les yeux hagards, rouges et etincelants  d'une expression sauvage. Il gesticulait, articulait des mots vides de  sens, poussait des cris horribles qui faisaient tressaillir tous  les assistants, et s'exaltait parfois au point qu'on n'osait par  l'approcher. Autour de lui, le silence de la terreur et du respect....  C'est alors qu'il repondait aux questions, annoncait l'avenir, le destin  des batailles, la volonte des dieux; et, chose etonnante! au sein de  ce delire, de cet enthousiasme religieux, son langage etait grave,  imposant, son eloquence noble et persuasive.\" [21]    Just so Saul strips off his clothes, \"prophesies\" before Samuel, and  lies down \"naked all that day and night.\"    Both Mariner and Moerenhout refuse to have recourse to the hypothesis of  imposture in order to account for the inspired state of the Polynesian  prophets. On the contrary, they fully believe in their sincerity.  Mariner tells the story of a young chief, an acquaintance of his, who  thought himself possessed by the Atua of a dead woman who had fallen in  love with him, and who wished him to die that he might be near her in  Bolotoo. And he died accordingly. But the most valuable evidence on this  head is contained in what the same authority says about King Finow's  son. The previous king, Toogoo Ahoo, had been assassinated by Finow, and  his soul, become an Atua of divine rank in Bolotoo, had been pleased  to visit and inspire Finow's son--with what particular object does not  appear.       When this young chief returned to Hapai, Mr. Mariner, who was     upon a footing of great friendship with him, one day asked him     how he felt himself when the spirit of Toogoo Ahoo visited him;     he replied that he could not well describe his feelings, but the     best he could say of it was, that he felt himself all over in a     glow of heat and quite restless and uncomfortable, and did not     feel his own personal identity, as it were, but seemed to have a     mind different from his own natural mind, his thoughts wandering     upon strange and unusual subjects, though perfectly sensible of     surrounding objects. He next asked him how he knew it was the     spirit of Toogoo Ahoo? His answer was, 'There's a fool! How can     I tell you _how_ I knew it! I felt and knew it was so by a     kind of consciousness; my _mind_ told me that it was Toogoo     Ahoo (vol. i. pp. 104, 105).    Finow's son was evidently made for a theological disputant, and fell  back at once on the inexpugnable stronghold of faith when other evidence  was lacking. \"There's a fool! I know it is true, because I know it,\" is  the exemplar and epitome of the sceptic-crushing process in other places  than the Tonga Islands.    The island of Bolotoo, to which all the souls (of the upper classes at  any rate) repair after the death of the body, and from which they return  at will to interfere, for good or evil, with the lives of those whom  they have left behind, obviously answers to Sheol. In Tongan tradition,  this place of souls is a sort of elysium above ground and pleasant  enough to live in. But, in other parts of Polynesia, the corresponding  locality, which is called Po, has to be reached by descending into the  earth, and is represented dark and gloomy like Sheol. But it was not  looked upon as a place of rewards and punishments in any sense. Whether  in Bolotoo or in Po, the soul took the rank it had in the flesh; and,  a shadow, lived among the shadows of the friends and houses and food of  its previous life.    The Tongan theologians recognised several hundred gods; but there was  one, already mentioned as their national god, whom they regarded as far  greater than any of the others, \"as a great chief from the top of the  sky down to the bottom of the earth\" (Mariner, vol. ii. p. 106). He  was also god of war, and the tutelar deity of the royal family, whoever  happened to be the incumbent of the royal office for the time being. He  had no priest except the king himself, and his visits, even to  royalty, were few and far between. The name of this supreme deity was  Ta-li-y-Tooboo, the literal meaning of which is said to be \"Wait there,  Tooboo,\" from which it would appear that the peculiar characteristic  of Ta-li-y-Tooboo, in the eyes of his worshippers, was persistence of  duration. And it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],[0,"Our Bird Comrades (#6)"],[1,"was due not so much to  accident as to the fact that I had \"caught on,\" and knew more about their  ruses.  One of the nests discovered is worth describing.    It was on a hilltop in Kansas, blown by the freshest breezes that sweep  over the limitless prairies.  An ideal spot, indeed, for the nesting of  birds that love lone places.  In one of my rambles I found this pleasant  elevation, and was attracted by the possibilities it offered for bird  study.  Presently a male Kentucky warbler appeared with a couple of large  worms in his beak, and I made up my mind to find his nest if perseverance  could accomplish that object.  So I sat down in the shade of a tree and  watched the bird closely.  Now note his admirable finesse.  After  flitting about among the bushes for a minute or two, chirping his protest  at my presence, he descended into the copse below and disappeared.  Of  course, any student of birds would have supposed that he had gone down  near the nest to feed his bairns, and that he only needed to go and  examine the place to discover the little avian secret.  My pulses  thrilled more than a little as I began my search for the nest right where  the bird had descended into the thicket.  But do you know that my most  strenuous efforts--and they _were_ strenuous on a hot day like  that--resulted only in disappointment?  The nest was not to be found  within a radius of a rod from the point where the little diplomat went  down.  A few days later I made my way to the hilltop, and do you know  that the shrewd bird played me the same trick?  He scuttled down into the  bushes at almost the same point as before, and no nest rewarded my  search.  I went home just about ready to give up my search for Kentucky  warblers' nests, for I had been hunting them for a number of years  without success.    However, in a few days I found my way again to the breezy hilltop.  The  chats, vireos, and indigo birds gave due warning of my approach, and I  felt sure that Master Kentucky and his mate would be on their guard.  To  my delight, in a few minutes the female presented herself in one of the  trees, her bill holding a bunch of worms.  Luckily she was not so wary or  diplomatic as her husband, and, in addition, she extremely anxious to  feed her hungry babies.  Instead of going over to the copse where the  male bird had played me such a clever trick, she flew down the path about  four rods to a small scrub oak, from which she soon dropped into the  weeds below.  Then I said to myself; \"Aha!\" and smiled in a knowing way.    I walked down the path to the tree, but no Kentucky warblers were to be  seen--not right away.  So I sat down in the path and waited to see what  would happen.  It was only a short time till the female appeared, with a  telltale bunch of worms in her beak.  A moment later her mate also  arrived, carrying a small worm in the usual way.  The situation was  growing interesting.  The two birdlets chirped and flitted about in the  tree for a long time, afraid to go down to the nest.  I moved slowly and  cautiously farther up the path to give them a better chance to divulge  their secret.  Presently the pretty madame summoned courage to drop to a  lower perch in the tree, then to a still lower one, then to the top of  one of the bushes below, and at last into the weed clump and out of sight.    I wasted no time.  In a minute I was pressing the weeds apart and looking  down admiringly into the little cot with its four half-fledged  occupants--the first Kentucky warbler's nest I had ever seen.  Set upon  the ground, its bulky foundation of dry leaves supported the cup proper,  which was lined with fine grass.  Easy enough to find when you knew  precisely where to look for it.    Think now of the little game the male bird had played me on my previous  visits to the haunt!  He had descended into the copse about four rods  distant from the nest instead of going down near its site; then he had  doubtless followed a secret pathway through the weeds and bushes to the  nest, fed his children, and hurried away without letting himself be seen.    The parent birds did not like the idea of my finding and inspecting their  nest, for they chirped and darted about in a panic.  To relieve their  anguish I retired up the slope a short distance, seated myself in the  pleasant shade of a scrub oak, and made an entry of my find in my  notebook.  Alas!  I had probably done harm to my little friends without  intending it, for their chirping attracted the attention of one of their  worst foes, and drew him to the spot.  I loitered about for perhaps ten  minutes, and then decided to take one more peep at the pretty domicile  before leaving the hilltop.  As I drew near, I observed that the parent  birds were chirping in a low, but heart-broken way, as if they were  almost stricken dumb with terror.  Were they so badly frightened because  I was returning to their nest?    I stepped up cautiously and looked down at the nest.  It was now my turn  to give vent to a cry of consternation, for what I saw was this: A large  blacksnake coiled about the nest, the fold of his neck wabbling to and  fro in a terrifying way, while with his mouth he was trying to seize one  of the bantlings.  Fortunately I had a good-sized stick, almost a club,  in my hand, and I wasted no time in bringing it down with all the force I  could command upon the serpent, taking care to deliver the blow at the  side of the nest.  The snake tried to uncoil, but another blow broke his  backbone, if indeed the first one had not done so, and he was in my  power.  He had swallowed one of the nestlings, but three were left, and  seemed to be in good condition.  On my return to the place a few days  later the nest was empty, and I fear that the remaining little ones had  also been destroyed, perhaps by the mate of the snake from which I had  rescued them.    On the shelf of a steep bluff covered with a riot of bushes and briars a  pair of hooded warblers found a dwelling place to their taste in the  spring of 1900.  This handsome birdlet may be known by his dainty yellow  hood, bordered with black, and cannot be mistaken for any other member of  the great feathered fraternity.  One cannot look at him without feeling  that Nature tried to see what she could do in the way of an unusual  arrangement of colors.  Who can tell what impelled her to make a living  gem like this, as odd as it is beautiful?    On the side of the bluff referred to I was first attracted by the  vivacious song of the little male, which I had not heard for several  years--not since an excursion I had taken into Louisiana and Mississippi.  His voice was clear and ringing, and the tune he executed was by no means  a meager performance.    One day a loud, metallic chirping was heard, and presently two hooded  warblers appeared, each with the proverbial green worm in its beak.  I  decided to remain in the nook and watch, for the nesting habits of these  rare warblers were new to me.  In and out, up and down, here and there,  they flitted, making a checker-work of black and gold amid the foliage,  craning their necks, peering at me with anxious inquiry in their dark  little eyes, and filling the woodland with their uneasy chirping.    It was a long time to wait, but at length patience had its reward; one of  the birds flew down to the bushes on the steep slope above me and fed a  youngster in plain view.  No time was lost in pushing through the bushy  tangle to the magic spot.  Behold! it was a young cowbird that had been  fed by the devoted little mother!  That was trying beyond expression--to  think that all the efforts of the pretty couple, all their intense  solicitude, was wasted on a great, hulking impostor like the cowbird.  He  had just scrambled from the nest, from which he had doubtless previously  crowded the rightful heirs of the family to perish from starvation on the  ground.  I found the nest only about a foot away from the perch of the  young bird--a deep, neat little basket, compactly felted with down and  plant fibers, set in the crotch of a slender bush of the thicket.  It was  certainly too small to accommodate any tenants besides the strapping  young cowbird.  In the spring of 1902 another hooded warbler's nest  rewarded my search.  Its holdings were four callow bantlings, all of  which were carried off by some marauder before my next visit.    Another little charmer of the woodland, especially of thick second-growth  timber, is the blue-winged warbler, which glories in the high-sounding  Latin name of _Helminthophila pinus_.  Wherever seen, he would attract  attention on account of the peculiar cut and color of his clothes.  A  conspicuous black line reaching from the corner of the mouth back through  the eye is a diagnostic feature of his plumage, while his crown and  breast gleam in bright yellow, almost golden in the sunshine; his wings  and tail are blue-gray, with some white trimmings, and his back and rump  are bright olive  There you have an array of colors that makes a picture  indeed.  Madame Blue-wing wears the same pattern as her lord, but the  hues are less brilliant.    The manners of Sir Blue-wing--I call him so because of his distinguished  air--are interesting, for they differ, in one respect at least, from  those of most of the other warblers of my acquaintance.  He flits about  among the branches in rather a leisurely way--for a warbler; but his main  characteristic is his unwarbler-like fashion of clinging back downward to  the under side of the twigs, after the manner of the chickadee, in order  to secure the nits and worms under the leaves.  He acts decidedly like a  diminutive trapeze performer.    His song consists of an insect-like buzz, divided into stanzas of two  syllables each, with a pensive strain running through it, as if the heart  of the little singer were filled with sadness.  While it sounds rather  faint at a distance, close at hand it has a strangely"]]]
