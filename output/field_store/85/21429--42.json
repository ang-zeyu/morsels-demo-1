Thus some of the  noblest melodies of Brahms, Grieg, and Tchaikowsky are actual  folk-tunes with slight variation or original melodies conceived in a  folk-song spirit.[22]    [Footnote 21: For an eloquent presentation of the significance of  Folk-music see the article by Henry F. Gilbert in the _Musical  Quarterly_ for October, 1917.]    [Footnote 22: For an able account of the important role that  folk-melodies are taking in modern music see Chapter V of _La Chanson  Populaire en France_ by Julian Tiersot.]    As music, unlike the other arts, lacks any model in the realm of  nature, it has had to work out its own laws, and its spontaneity and  directness are the result. It has not become imitative, utilitarian or  bound by arbitrary conventions. As Berlioz says in the _Grotesques de  la Musique_: \"Music exists by itself; it has no need of poetry, and if  every human language were to perish, it would be none the less the  most poetic, the grandest and the freest of all the arts.\" When we  reach the centuries in which definite records are available, we find a  wealth of folk-songs from the Continental nations: Irish, Scotch,  English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, etc.[23] In these  we can trace the transition from the old modes to our modern major and  minor scales; the principles of tonality and of rudimentary  modulation, the dividing of the musical thought into periodic lengths  by means of cadential endings, the instinct for contrast and for the  unity gained by restatement. No better definition of Folk-songs can be  given than that of Parry in his _Evolution of the Art of Music_ where  he calls them \"the first essays made by man in distributing his notes  so as to express his feelings in terms of design.\" In folk-tunes this  design has been dominated by the metrical phraseology of the poetic  stanzas with which they were associated; for between the structure of  melody and that of poetry there is always a close correspondence. In  Folk-songs, therefore, we find a growing instinct for balanced musical  expression and, above all, an application of the principle of  Restatement after Contrast. The following example drawn from Irish  Folk-music[24]--which, for emotional depth, is justly considered the  finest in the world--will make the point clear.    [Music: THE FLIGHT OF THE EARLS]    [Footnote 23: The same statement is true of the Oriental nations, the  Arabians, Persians and Greeks, who are left out of the enumeration  only because their development in many respects has been along  different lines from ours. For suggestive speculations as to early  music among all nations see _Primitive Music_ by Richard Wallaschek.]    [Footnote 24: For illuminating comments on the Folk-music of all the  English-speaking peoples see Chapter XII of Ernest Walker's _History  of Music in England_. The famous Petrie collection of Irish Folk-tunes  should also be consulted.]    The statement is sometimes made that the principles of our modern  system of tonality and of modulation are derived from Folk-music. This  is only partially true, for pure Folk-songs always developed under the  influence of the old medieval modes, long before the establishment of  our fixed major and minor scales. Furthermore, as these were single  unaccompanied melodies, they showed slight connection with modulation  or change of key in the modern sense of the term--which implies a  system of harmonization in several voices. It is true that there was  an instinctive and growing recognition of the importance of the three  chief tonal centres: the Tonic or Keynote, the Dominant (a perfect  fifth _above_) and the Subdominant (a perfect fifth _below_) and at  times the relative minor. All these changes are illustrated in the  melody just cited; _e.g._, in the fourth measure[25] there is an  implication of E minor, in measures seven and eight there is a  distinct modulation to D major, the Dominant, and in the ninth measure  to C major, the Subdominant. This acceptance of other tonal  centres--distant a fifth from the main key-note--doubtless arose from  their simplicity and naturalness, and was later sanctioned by  acoustical law; the interval of a perfect fifth having one of the  simplest ratios (2-3), and being familiar to people as the first  overtone (after the octave) struck off by any sounding body--such as a  bell or an organ pipe. The Venetian composers, notably Willaert, had  also quite fully developed this principle of Tonic, Dominant and  Subdominant harmony in order to give homogeneity to their antiphonal  choruses. Even to-day these tonal centres are still used; for they are  elemental, like the primitive colors of the spectroscope. But  modulation, in the modern sense of a free shifting of the centre of  gravity to _any one_ of the twelve semitones of our chromatic scale,  was not developed and accepted until after the acoustical reforms of  Rameau, and the system of tuning keyed instruments embodied in that  work called the _Well-tempered Clavichord_ of Sebastian Bach. Both  these men published their discoveries about the year 1720.    [Footnote 25: In counting the measures of a phrase always consider the  first _complete_ measure,--_never_ a partial measure--as _one_.]    As we have just used the term _modal_, and since many Folk-songs in  the old modes sound peculiar or even wrong (hence the preposterous  emendations of modern editors!) because our ears can listen only in  terms of the fixed major and minor scales, a few words of explanation  concerning the nature of the medieval modes should here be given.  Their essential peculiarity is the freer relationship of tones and  semitones than is found in the definite pattern of our modern scales.  It is of great importance that the music-lover should train himself to  think naturally in these modes; for there has been a significant  return to their freedom and variety on the part of such modern  composers as Brahms, Tchaikowsky, Dvo[vr]ak, d'Indy, Debussy and  others, and some of their most individual effects are gained through  the introduction of modal types of expression. The following modes are  those most commonly employed in the formation of Folk-songs.    [Music: DORIAN]    [Music: PHRYGIAN]    [Music: LYDIAN]    [Music: MIXOLYDIAN]    [Music: AEOLIAN]    [Music: IONIAN]    The Dorian mode, at the outset, is identical with our modern minor  scale; its peculiarity lies in the _semitone_ between the 6th and 7th  degrees and the _whole_ tone between the 7th and 8th. An excellent  example of a modern adaptation of this mode may be found in Guilmant's  March for organ (see Supplement, Example No. 7). The mysterious  opening measures of Debussy's opera _Pelleas et Melisande_ also owe  their atmosphere to this mode, _e.g._    [Music]    The Phrygian mode is one of the most individual to our modern ears  with its first step a _semitone_ and with the _whole_ tone between the  7th and 8th degrees. Under the influence of harmonic development there  was worked out a cadence, known as Phrygian, which is often found in  modern music, _e.g._    [Music]    The opening measures of the slow movement of Brahms's _Fourth  Symphony_ are an excellent example of a melody in the Phrygian mode,  _e.g._    [Music]    The contrast between these measures, with their archaic flavor, and  the sudden change in measure four to the modern tonality of E major,  is very striking. Bach's well-known choral, _O Sacred Head now  wounded_ also begins in the Phrygian mode, _e.g._    [Music]    For a beautiful modern example of this Phrygian mode see the  introduction to F.S. Converse's _Dramatic Poem Job_, for voices and  orchestra.    The Lydian mode is identical with our major scale except for the  semitone between the 4th and 5th degrees. That this change, however,  gives a very characteristic effect may be seen in the passage by  Beethoven from his String-Quartet op. 132--_Song of Thanksgiving_ in  the Lydian mode (see Supplement Ex. No. 8). The Mixolydian mode is  also identical with our modern major scale except for the _whole_ tone  between the 7th and 8th degrees. This mode has had very slight usage  in modern music; because, with the development of harmony,[26] the  instinct became so strong for a leading tone (the 7th degree)--only a  semitone distant from the upper tonic--that the original whole tone  has gradually disappeared. The Aeolian Mode, mainly identical with our  customary minor scale, has the characteristic whole tone between the  7th and 8th degrees. Examples of this mode abound in modern  literature; two excellent instances being the first theme of the  Finale of Dvo[vr]ak's _New World Symphony_, _e.g._,    [Music]    and the following passage from the _Legend_ for a capella voices of  Tchaikowsky, _e.g._    [Music]    The Ionian mode corresponds exactly with our modern major scale, and  the common people among all nations early showed a strong predilection  for its use. The Church, in fact, because of this popularity with the  people, named it the \"modus lascivus\" and prohibited its use in the  ecclesiastical liturgy. One of the very earliest Folk-tunes  extant--\"Sumer is icumen in\" (already referred to)--is in the Ionian  mode and, according to Cecil Sharp,[27] the majority of English  Folk-tunes are in this same mode.    [Footnote 26: The chief reason for this leading tone, in addition to  the natural tendency of singers to raise their voices as near as  possible to the upper tonic, was so that the dominant chord, the third  of which is always the 7th degree, might invariably be a _Major_  Triad.]    [Footnote 27: For many suggestive comments on the whole subject see  his book _English Folk-Song_.]    We now cite a few typical folk-songs (taken from national sources)  which, in their structure, show a natural instinct "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30576"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#6)"],[1,"  fixes me up two papers, one 'bout a yard long and the other some  smaller, but both has big, gold seals what he says is the seal of the  State of Missouri.
