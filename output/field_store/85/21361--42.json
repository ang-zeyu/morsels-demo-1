There was incessant and loud talking and chattering, with here and there  the shriller tones of a French voice being distinctly noticeable in the  din. There were a good many French ladies and gentlemen present, easily  recognisable, even in the distance, for their clothes were of more sober  hue and of lesser richness than those of their English compeers.    But they were great lords and ladies, nevertheless, Dukes and Duchesses  and Countesses, come to England for fear of being murdered by those  devils in their own country. Richmond was full of them just now, as they  were made right welcome both at the Palace and at the magnificent home  of Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney.    Ah! here comes Sir Andrew Ffoulkes with his lady! so pretty and  dainty does she look, like a little china doll, in her new-fashioned  short-waisted gown: her brown hair in soft waves above her smooth  forehead, her great, hazel eyes fixed in unaffected admiration on the  gallant husband by her side.    \"No wonder she dotes on him!\" sighed pretty Mistress Polly after she had  bobbed her curtsy to my lady. \"The brave deeds he did for love of her!  Rescued her from those murderers over in France and brought her to  England safe and sound, having fought no end of them single-handed, so  I've beard it said. Have you not, Master Thomas Jezzard?\"    And she looked defiantly at her meek-looking cavalier.    \"Bah!\" replied Master Thomas with quite unusual vehemence in response to  the disparaging look in her brown eyes, \"'Tis not he who did it all,  as you well know, Mistress Polly. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes is a gallant  gentleman, you may take your Bible oath on that, but he that fights  the murdering frogeaters single-handed is he whom they call The Scarlet  Pimpernel: the bravest gentleman in all the world.\"    Then, as at mention of the national hero, he thought that he detected in  Mistress Polly's eyes an enthusiasm which he could not very well ascribe  to his own individuality, he added with some pique:    \"But they do say that this same Scarlet Pimpernel is mightily  ill-favoured, and that's why no one ever sees him. They say he is fit to  scare the crows away and that no Frenchy can look twice at his face, for  it's so ugly, and so they let him get out of the country, rather than  look at him again.\"    \"Then they do say a mighty lot of nonsense,\" retorted Mistress Polly,  with a shrug of her pretty shoulders, \"and if that be so, then why don't  you go over to France and join hands with the Scarlet Pimpernel? I'll  warrant no Frenchman'll want to look twice at your face.\"    A chorus of laughter greeted this sally, for the two young people had  in the meanwhile been joined by several of their friends, and now formed  part of a merry group near the band, some sitting, others standing, but  all bent on seeing as much as there was to see in Richmond Gala this  day. There was Johnny Cullen, the grocer's apprentice from Twickenham,  and Ursula Quekett, the baker's daughter, and several \"young 'uns\" from  the neighbourhood, as well as some older folk.    And all of them enjoyed a joke when they heard one and thought Mistress  Polly's retort mightily smart. But then Mistress Polly was possessed of  two hundred pounds, all her own, left to her by her grandmother, and  on the strength of this extensive fortune had acquired a reputation for  beauty and wit not easily accorded to a wench that had been penniless.    But Mistress Polly was also very kind-hearted. She loved to tease Master  Jezzard, who was an indefatigable hanger-on at her pretty skirts, and  whose easy conquest had rendered her somewhat contemptuous, but at the  look of perplexed annoyance and bewildered distress in the lad's face,  her better nature soon got the upper hand. She realized that her remark  had been unwarrantably spiteful, and wishing to make atonement, she  said with a touch of coquetry which quickly spread balm over the honest  yokel's injured vanity:    \"La! Master Jezzard, you do seem to make a body say some queer things.  But there! you must own 'tis mighty funny about that Scarlet Pimpernel!\"  she added, appealing to the company in general, just as if Master  Jezzard had been disputing the fact. \"Why won't he let anyone see who he  is? And those who know him won't tell. Now I have it for a fact from  my lady's own maid Lucy, that the young lady as is stopping at Lady  Blakeney's house has actually spoken to the man. She came over from  France, come a fortnight to-morrow; she and the gentleman they call  Mossoo Deroulede. They both saw the Scarlet Pimpernel and spoke to him.  He brought them over from France. Then why won't they say?\"    \"Say what?\" commented Johnny Cullen, the apprentice.    \"Who this mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel is.\"    \"Perhaps he isn't,\" said old Clutterbuck, who was clerk of the vestry at  the church of St. John's the Evangelist.    \"Yes!\" he added sententiously, for he was fond of his own sayings and  usually liked to repeat them before he had quite done with them, \"that's  it, you may be sure. Perhaps he isn't.\"    \"What do you mean, Master Clutterbuck?\" asked Ursula Quekett, for she  knew the old man liked to explain his wise saws, and as she wanted to  marry his son, she indulged him whenever she could. \"What do you mean?  He isn't what?\"    \"He isn't. That's all,\" explained Clutterbuck with vague solemnity.    Then seeing that he had gained the attention of the little party round  him, he condescended to come to more logical phraseology.    \"I mean, that perhaps we must not ask, 'who IS this mysterious Scarlet  Pimpernel?' but 'who WAS that poor and unfortunate gentleman?'\"    \"Then you think...\" suggested Mistress Polly, who felt unaccountably  low-spirited at this oratorical pronouncement.    \"I have it for a fact,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck solemnly, \"that he whom  they call the Scarlet Pimpernel no longer exists now: that he was  collared by the Frenchies, as far back as last fall, and in the language  of the poets, has never been heard of no more.\"    Mr. Clutterbuck was very fond of quoting from the works of certain  writers whose names he never mentioned, but who went by the poetical  generality of \"the poets.\" Whenever he made use of phrases which he was  supposed to derive from these great and unnamed authors, he solemnly  and mechanically raised his hat, as a tribute of respect to these giant  minds.    \"You think that The Scarlet Pimpernel is dead, Mr. Clutterbuck? That  those horrible Frenchies murdered him? Surely you don't mean that?\"  sighed Mistress Polly ruefully.    Mr. Clutterbuck put his hand up to his hat, preparatory no doubt to  making another appeal to the mysterious poets, but was interrupted in  the very act of uttering great thoughts by a loud and prolonged laugh  which came echoing from a distant corner of the grounds.    \"Lud! but I'd know that laugh anywhere,\" said Mistress Quekett, whilst  all eyes were turned in the direction whence the merry noise had come.    Half a head taller than any of his friends around him, his lazy blue  eyes scanning from beneath their drooping lids the motley throng around  him, stood Sir Percy Blakeney, the centre of a gaily-dressed little  group which seemingly had just crossed the toll-gate.    \"A fine specimen of a man, for sure,\" remarked Johnnie Cullen, the  apprentice.    \"Aye! you may take your Bible oath on that!\" sighed Mistress Polly, who  was inclined to be sentimental.    \"Speakin' as the poets,\" pronounced Mr. Clutterbuck sententiously,  \"inches don't make a man.\"    \"Nor fine clothes neither,\" added Master Jezzard, who did not approve of  Mistress Polly's sentimental sigh.    \"There's my lady!\" gasped Miss Barbara suddenly, clutching Master  Clutterbuck's arm vigorously. \"Lud! but she is beautiful to-day!\"    Beautiful indeed, and radiant with youth and happiness, Marguerite  Blakeney had just gone through the gates and was walking along the sward  towards the band stand. She was dressed in clinging robes of shimmery  green texture, the new-fashioned high-waisted effect suiting her  graceful figure to perfection. The large Charlotte, made of velvet to  match the gown, cast a deep shadow over the upper part of her face, and  gave a peculiar softness to the outline of her forehead and cheeks.    Long lace mittens covered her arms and hands and a scarf of diaphanous  material edged with dull gold hung loosely around her shoulders.    Yes! she was beautiful! No captious chronicler has ever denied that! and  no one who knew her before, and who saw her again on this late summer's  afternoon, could fail to mark the additional charm of her magnetic  personality. There was a tenderness in her face as she turned her head  to and fro, a joy of living in her eyes that was quite irresistibly  fascinating.    Just now she was talking animatedly with the young girl who was walking  beside her, and laughing merrily the while:    \"Nay! we'll find your Paul, never fear! Lud! child, have you forgotten  he is in England now, and that there's no fear of his being kidnapped  here on the green in broad daylight.\"    The young girl gave a slight shudder and her child-like face became a  shade paler than before. Marguerite took her hand and gave it a kindly  pressure. Juliette Marny, but lately come to England, saved from under  the very knife of the guillotine, by a timely and daring rescue, could  scarcely believe as yet that she and the man she loved were really out  of danger.    \"There is Monsieur Deroulede,\" said Marguerite after a slight pause,  giving the young girl time to recover herself and pointing to a group of  men close by. \"He is among friends, as you see.\"    They made such a pretty picture, these two women, as they stood together  for a moment on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27867"],[0,"Scientific American magazine, Vol. 2 Issue 1 (#6)"],[1,"the house is made sufficiently light without the use of lamps.  Some time ago the State Geological Surveyors paid this spring a visit,  and analyzed the gas, which was found to be composed of sulphurated  and carbonated hydrogen. The water is strongly impregnated with iron.           *       *       *       *       *          COOL FORETHOUGHT.      One of the most admirable instances of prudential forethought we have  ever heard of, occurred in Boston a few days since. Three Irishmen  were engaged in taking down a wall in Mount Vernon street. The wall  fell upon and buried them. A lady from the opposite side of the street  rushed out, and calling to those who were rescuing the poor fellows,  said, \"Bring them in here. Bring them in here. I have been expecting  this all day.\" The men were carried into her house, and, true enough,  she had \"every thing ready,\" bandages, lint, laudanum, and all. If  this be not an instance of _cool forethought_, we know not what is.           *       *       *       *       *          IT MAY BE SO.      It is stated in a Cincinnati paper, that the body of a drowned child  has been discovered by means of a loaf of bread in which was deposited  a quantity of quicksilver. The loaf was sent afloat in the canal, and  after floating some distance, remained stationary, and beneath the  spot thus indicated, the child was found. That mercury may have a  natural attraction towards a human body, is possible; but the use of  the loaf of bread in combination, indicate a superstitious faith  rather than real science.           *       *       *       *       *      Several rich lead mines have recently been discovered on the  Mississippi River, a few miles above Bellevue. The unusual low state  of the river lead to the discovery.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW INVENTIONS.      HOWE'S SEWING MACHINE.      We have heretofore noticed the extraordinary invention by Mr. Elias  Howe, Jr., of Cambridge, Mass.--a machine that sews beautiful and  strong seams in cloth as rapid as nine tailors. We are not yet  prepared to furnish a full description of this machine, but the  following claims, in the words of the patentee, may give some idea of  the various parts in combination. This machine was patented September  10th.    \"I claim the lifting of the thread that passes through the needle eye  by the lifting rod, for the purpose of forming a loop of loose thread  that is to be subsequently drawn in by the passage of the shuttle;  said lifting rod being furnished with a lifting pin, and governed in  its motions by the guide pieces and other devices.    \"I claim the holding of the thread that is given out by the shuttle,  so as to prevent its unwinding from the shuttle bobbin, after the  shuttle has passed through the loop, said thread being held by means  of the lever, or clipping piece.    \"I claim the manner of arranging and combining the small lever, with  the sliding box in combination with the spring piece, for the purpose  of tightening the stitch as the needle is retracted.    \"I claim the holding of the cloth to be sewn, by the use of a baster  plate, furnished with points for that purpose, and with holes enabling  it to operate as a rack, thereby carrying the cloth forward, and  dispensing altogether with the necessity of basting the parts  together.\"           *       *       *       *       *          STEERING APPARATUS.      Mr. R. C. Holmes, says the United States Gazette, has invented a new  application of the tiller rope to the wheel for steering vessels, and  has prepared a model of the whole application, tiller-frame, wheel,  and rope, so that the properties of the invention can be easily  discovered. The advantages are that there is no slack made; and,  consequently, there is no chafing, and a single hand at the wheel will  do the ordinary work of two men.           *       *       *       *       *          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC BOAT.      It is stated in some of our exchanges, that Dr. Page, of Washington,  has perfected a boat to be propelled by the electro-magnetic power. We  know of no man better qualified to produce and introduce successfully  such an invention, and we feel assured that whatever enterprise Dr.  Page undertakes in that line, will be very apt to go ahead. We hope  soon to obtain further intelligence on the subject.           *       *       *       *       *      It is reported that the British government has granted $100,000 per  annum to the royal company of Atlantic steamers, for the establishment  of a post route to the Pacific, across the Isthmus of Panama.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVEMENT IN BOATS.      There is a model of a steamboat to be seen on the Chesapeake, invented  and constructed by Cyrus Williams, Esq., which is exciting  considerable interest among steamboat men. It is in the usual form of  a boat, but more flat-bottomed, and much longer in proportion to its  width, than the boats now in use, giving it a greater surface to the  water, and of course a lighter draught. The improvement is in applying  the bridge principle of bearers in supporting length of boats. It  looks perfectly feasible. Mr. Williams thinks it will be a great  saving of expense, as it takes much less timber, and all of it can be  sawed in a mill, being straight stuff. He offers to build a boat on  this model, furnishing one third of the stock, and if it does not make  25 miles to the hour, he will forfeit his share.           *       *       *       *       *          CASTING IRON CANNON BY A GALVANIC PROCESS.      A hoaxical looking article, under the above caption, is going the  rounds, and represents that successful experiments on this subject  have been recently made at Berlin. As no description or illustration  of the process or principle is given, we leave the subject for those  who are ever ready to swallow whatever appears in a newspaper, without  regard to probability.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW SHINGLE MACHINE.      Among the patents particularly noticed in the Commissioner's report,  is one for a shingle machine, which cuts the shingles in a peculiar  form. The shingles cut by this machine does not taper from one  extremity to the other, but the taper is confined to about half the  length of it at one end, the faces of the remaining half being  parallel to each other. This shape of the shingle avoids the bending  which is incidental to those of the ordinary form, when nailed upon  the roof--an object well worthy of attainment.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVEMENT IN BLACKSMITHS FORGES.      This invention was entered at the Patent Office on the 15th instant,  by James K. Hobbs. The improvement consists in the placing of  grate-bars at the bottom of the fire chamber, below which is an open  air chamber into which the cinders and ashes fall through the grate,  instead of accumulating and clogging the fire chamber. The cinders may  be drawn out of the air chamber by an opening at the side of the  forge. The blast is admitted above the grate, and the mouth of the air  chamber being ordinarily closed, the blast is not affected by the  grate. We think it must prove a useful invention.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED FIRE ENGINE.      This improvement consists in part, in the arrangement of two sets of  levers and hand poles on each side, in such a manner that \"when force  is applied to the hand-poles of the outside levers, in a reverse  direction to that which is applied to the hand poles of the inside  levers, both powers will agree in forcing the pistons of the pumps in  one and the same direction, while the reverse motion of the levers  will prevent the engine from rocking\". Entered at the Patent Office, on  the 10th instant, by Barton & Button.           *       *       *       *       *          A SIMPLE CHEESE-PRESS.    [Illustration]      An ingenious mechanic, not long since, hearing some persons conversing  on the ordinary cost of cheese-presses, which is generally from three  to six dollars, boldly averred that he could build a cheese-press in  one hour, which would answer a good purpose as such, and which might  be afforded for fifty cents. Being bantered on the subject, he went to  work, and by means of a good lathe and boring machine, he actually  produced his cheese-press within the hour; though not very smoothly  finished. We give a sketch of it at the head of this article,--too  plain to require explanation. Subsequently, several others were made  on the same plan.           *       *       *       *       *          CAST IRON ROOFING.      A specimen of cast-iron plates for roofing of buildings, says the  Philadelphia Ledger, has been exhibited at the Exchange, in  Philadelphia, by the inventor and patentee, Mr. Wm. Beach. The plates  are about a foot square, and are made to fit one into another so as to  render the roof perfectly water-tight, with the application of white  lead to the joints. In every respect this material for roofing is  preferable to any other description now in use. As to its durability,  there can be no doubt that it would remain perfectly whole for ages,  if covered occasionally with a coat of paint, and even without that  preservative, rust would not affect it materially for a period of  fifty years at least. As compared with copper, the cost would be  nearly one half, as it is expected the iron can be furnished at 16  cents per square foot, while copper would at the most moderate  estimate cost 28 cents. As regards the weight of an iron roof, which  at first sight would appear an objection, it is far less than one  formed of slate, and does not much exceed one of copper. The iron  plates weigh three and a half pounds per square foot. A slate roof  would cost about eight cents per square foot, but for durability, and  the ease with which it can be put on and made water tight, the iron"]]]
