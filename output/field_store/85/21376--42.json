Such a witness, despite his  admitted use of Smith's text (if it is really all by Smith throughout)  is not to be despised, and he is not despised in America.(1) Strachey,  it is true, had not, like Smith, been captured by Indians and either  treated with perfect kindness and consideration (as Smith reported at  the time), or tied to a tree and threatened with arrows, and laid out  to have his head knocked in with a stone; as he alleged sixteen years  later! Strachey, not being captured, did not owe his release (1) to  the magnanimity of Powhattan, (2) to his own ingenious lies, (3) to  the intercession of Pocahontas, as Smith, and his friends for him, at  various dates inconsistently declared. Smith certainly saw more of the  natives at home: Strachey brought a more studious mind to what he could  learn of their customs and ideas; and is not a convicted braggart. I  conjecture that one of Strachey's sources was a native named Kemps.  Smith had seized Kemps and Kinsock in 1609. Unknown authorities (Powell?  and Todkill?) represent these two savages as \"the most exact villaines  in the country\".(2) They were made to labour in fetters, then were set  at liberty, but \"little desired it\".(3) Some \"souldiers\" ran away to the  liberated Kemps, who brought them back to Smith.(4) Why Kemps and his  friend are called \"two of the most exact villains in the country\"  does not appear. Kemps died \"of the surveye\" (scurvey, probably) at  Jamestown, in 1610-11. He was much made of by Lord De la Warr, \"could  speak a pretty deal of our English, and came orderly to church every day  to prayers\". He gave Strachey the names of Powhattan's wives, and told  him, truly or not, that Pocahontas was married, about 1610, to an Indian  named Kocoum.(5) I offer the guess that Kemps and Machumps, who came  and went from Pocahontas, and recited an Indian prayer which Strachey  neglected to copy out, may have been among Strachey's authorities. I  shall, of course, be told that Kemps picked up Ahone at church. This did  not strike Strachey as being the fact; he had no opinion of the creed in  which Ahone was a factor, \"the misery and thraldome under which Sathan  has bound these wretched miscreants\". According to Strachey, the  priests, far from borrowing any part of our faith, \"feare and tremble  lest the knowledge of God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ be taught in  these parts\".      (1) Arber, cxvii. Strachey mentions that (before his arrival in  Virginia) Pocahontas turned cart-wheels, naked, in Jamestown, being then  under twelve, and not yet wearing the apron. Smith says she was ten  in 1608, but does not mention the cart-wheels. Later, he found it  convenient to put her age at twelve or thirteen in 1608. Most American  scholars, such as Mr. Adams, entirely distrust the romantic later  narratives of Smith.    (2) The Proeeedings, etc., by W. S. Arber, p. 151.    (3) Ibid., p. 155.    (4) Ibid., p. 157.    (5) Strachey, pp. 54, 55.      Strachey is therefore for putting down the priests, and, like Smith  (indeed here borrowing from Smith), accuses them of sacrificing  children. To Smith's statement that such a rite was worked at  Quiyough-cohanock, Strachey adds that Sir George Percy (who was with  Smith) \"was at, and observed\" a similar mystery at Kecoughtan. It is  plain that the rite was not a sacrifice, but a Bora, or initiation, and  the parallel of the Spartan flogging of boys, with the retreat of the  boys and their instructors, is very close, and, of course, unnoted by  classical scholars except Mr. Frazer. Strachey ends with the critical  remark that we shall not know all the certainty of the religion and  mysteries till we can capture some of the priests, or Quiyough-quisocks.    Students who have access to a good library of Americana may do more  to elucidate Ahone. I regard him as in a line with Kiehtan and the God  spoken of by Heriot, and do not believe (1) that Strachey lied; (2) that  natives deceived Strachey; (3) that Ahone was borrowed from \"the God of  Captain Smith\".          MYTH, RITUAL, AND RELIGION.        CHAPTER I. SYSTEMS OF MYTHOLOGY.    Definitions of religion--Contradictory evidence--\"Belief in spiritual  beings\"--Objection to Mr. Tylor's definition--Definition as regards  this argument--Problem: the contradiction between religion and myth--Two  human moods--Examples--Case of Greece--Ancient mythologists--Criticism  by Eusebius--Modern mythological systems--Mr. Max Muller--Mannhardt.      The word \"Religion\" may be, and has been, employed in many different  senses, and with a perplexing width of significance. No attempt to  define the word is likely to be quite satisfactory, but almost any  definition may serve the purpose of an argument, if the writer who  employs it states his meaning frankly and adheres to it steadily. An  example of the confusions which may arise from the use of the term  \"religion\" is familiar to students. Dr. J. D. Lang wrote concerning the  native races of Australia: \"They have nothing whatever of the character  of religion, or of religious observances, to distinguish them from the  beasts that perish\". Yet in the same book Dr. Lang published evidence  assigning to the natives belief in \"Turramullun, the chief of demons,  who is the author of disease, mischief and wisdom\".(1) The belief in  a superhuman author of \"disease, mischief and wisdom\" is certainly  a religious belief not conspicuously held by \"the beasts\"; yet all  religion was denied to the Australians by the very author who prints  (in however erroneous a style) an account of part of their creed. This  writer merely inherited the old missionary habit of speaking about the  god of a non-Christian people as a \"demon\" or an \"evil spirit\".      (1) See Primitive Culture, second edition, i. 419.      Dr. Lang's negative opinion was contradicted in testimony published by  himself, an appendix by the Rev. Mr. Ridley, containing evidence of  the belief in Baiame. \"Those who have learned that 'God' is the name by  which we speak of the Creator, say that Baiame is God.\"(1)      (1) Lang's Queensland, p. 445, 1861.      As \"a minimum definition of religion,\" Mr. Tylor has suggested \"the  belief in spiritual beings\". Against this it may be urged that, while we  have no definite certainty that any race of men is destitute of belief  in spiritual beings, yet certain moral and creative deities of low races  do not seem to be envisaged as \"spiritual\" at all. They are regarded  as EXISTENCES, as BEINGS, unconditioned by Time, Space, or Death, and  nobody appears to have put the purely metaphysical question, \"Are these  beings spiritual or material?\"(1) Now, if a race were discovered which  believed in such beings, yet had no faith in spirits, that race could  not be called irreligious, as it would have to be called in Mr. Tylor's  \"minimum definition\". Almost certainly, no race in this stage of belief  in nothing but unconditioned but not expressly spiritual beings is  extant. Yet such a belief may conceivably have existed before men had  developed the theory of spirits at all, and such a belief, in creative  and moral unconditioned beings, not alleged to be spiritual, could not  be excluded from a definition of religion.(2)      (1) See The Making of Religion, pp. 201-210.    (2) \"The history of the Jews, nay, the history of our own mind, proves  to demonstration that the thought of God is a far easier thought, and a  far earlier, than that of a spirit.\" Father Tyrrell, S. J., The Month,  October, 1898. As to the Jews, the question is debated. As to our own  infancy, we are certainly taught about God before we are likely to be  capable of the metaphysical notion of spirit. But we can scarcely reason  from children in Christian houses to the infancy of the race.      For these reasons we propose (merely for the purpose of the present  work) to define religion as the belief in a primal being, a Maker,  undying, usually moral, without denying that the belief in spiritual  beings, even if immoral, may be styled religious. Our definition is  expressly framed for the purpose of the argument, because that argument  endeavours to bring into view the essential conflict between religion  and myth. We intend to show that this conflict between the religious  and the mythical conception is present, not only (where it has been  universally recognised) in the faiths of the ancient civilised peoples,  as in Greece, Rome, India and Egypt, but also in the ideas of the lowest  known savages.    It may, of course, be argued that the belief in Creator is itself a  myth. However that may be, the attitude of awe, and of moral obedience,  in face of such a supposed being, is religious in the sense of the  Christian religion, whereas the fabrication of fanciful, humorous, and  wildly irrational fables about that being, or others, is essentially  mythical in the ordinary significance of that word, though not absent  from popular Christianity.    Now, the whole crux and puzzle of mythology is, \"Why, having attained  (in whatever way) to a belief in an undying guardian, 'Master of Life,'  did mankind set to work to evolve a chronique scandaleuse about HIM?  And why is that chronique the elaborately absurd set of legends which we  find in all mythologies?\"    In answering, or trying to answer, these questions, we cannot go behind  the beliefs of the races now most immersed in savage ignorance. About  the psychology of races yet more undeveloped we can have no historical  knowledge. Among the lowest known tribes we usually find, just as in  ancient Greece, the belief in a deathless \"Father,\" \"Master,\" \"Maker,\"  and also the crowd of humorous, obscene, fanciful myths which are in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"one,\" said the old man.    \"Warburton's tone is worse than mine; he pretends to be bored. I'm not  in the least bored; I find life only too interesting.\"    \"Ah, too interesting; you shouldn't allow it to be that, you know!\"    \"I'm never bored when I come here,\" said Lord Warburton. \"One gets such  uncommonly good talk.\"    \"Is that another sort of joke?\" asked the old man. \"You've no excuse for  being bored anywhere. When I was your age I had never heard of such a  thing.\"    \"You must have developed very late.\"    \"No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason. When I was twenty  years old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working tooth and  nail. You wouldn't be bored if you had something to do; but all you  young men are too idle. You think too much of your pleasure. You're too  fastidious, and too indolent, and too rich.\"    \"Oh, I say,\" cried Lord Warburton, \"you're hardly the person to accuse a  fellow-creature of being too rich!\"    \"Do you mean because I'm a banker?\" asked the old man.    \"Because of that, if you like; and because you have--haven't you?--such  unlimited means.\"    \"He isn't very rich,\" the other young man mercifully pleaded. \"He has  given away an immense deal of money.\"    \"Well, I suppose it was his own,\" said Lord Warburton; \"and in that case  could there be a better proof of wealth? Let not a public benefactor  talk of one's being too fond of pleasure.\"    \"Daddy's very fond of pleasure--of other people's.\"    The old man shook his head. \"I don't pretend to have contributed  anything to the amusement of my contemporaries.\"    \"My dear father, you're too modest!\"    \"That's a kind of joke, sir,\" said Lord Warburton.    \"You young men have too many jokes. When there are no jokes you've  nothing left.\"    \"Fortunately there are always more jokes,\" the ugly young man remarked.    \"I don't believe it--I believe things are getting more serious. You  young men will find that out.\"    \"The increasing seriousness of things, then that's the great opportunity  of jokes.\"    \"They'll have to be grim jokes,\" said the old man. \"I'm convinced there  will be great changes, and not all for the better.\"    \"I quite agree with you, sir,\" Lord Warburton declared. \"I'm very sure  there will be great changes, and that all sorts of queer things will  happen. That's why I find so much difficulty in applying your advice;  you know you told me the other day that I ought to 'take hold' of  something. One hesitates to take hold of a thing that may the next  moment be knocked sky-high.\"    \"You ought to take hold of a pretty woman,\" said his companion. \"He's  trying hard to fall in love,\" he added, by way of explanation, to his  father.    \"The pretty women themselves may be sent flying!\" Lord Warburton  exclaimed.    \"No, no, they'll be firm,\" the old man rejoined; \"they'll not be  affected by the social and political changes I just referred to.\"    \"You mean they won't be abolished? Very well, then, I'll lay hands on  one as soon as possible and tie her round my neck as a life-preserver.\"    \"The ladies will save us,\" said the old man; \"that is the best of them  will--for I make a difference between them. Make up to a good one and  marry her, and your life will become much more interesting.\"    A momentary silence marked perhaps on the part of his auditors a sense  of the magnanimity of this speech, for it was a secret neither for his  son nor for his visitor that his own experiment in matrimony had not  been a happy one. As he said, however, he made a difference; and these  words may have been intended as a confession of personal error; though  of course it was not in place for either of his companions to remark  that apparently the lady of his choice had not been one of the best.    \"If I marry an interesting woman I shall be interested: is that what you  say?\" Lord Warburton asked. \"I'm not at all keen about marrying--your  son misrepresented me; but there's no knowing what an interesting woman  might do with me.\"    \"I should like to see your idea of an interesting woman,\" said his  friend.    \"My dear fellow, you can't see ideas--especially such highly ethereal  ones as mine. If I could only see it myself--that would be a great step  in advance.\"    \"Well, you may fall in love with whomsoever you please; but you mustn't  fall in love with my niece,\" said the old man.    His son broke into a laugh. \"He'll think you mean that as a provocation!  My dear father, you've lived with the English for thirty years, and  you've picked up a good many of the things they say. But you've never  learned the things they don't say!\"    \"I say what I please,\" the old man returned with all his serenity.    \"I haven't the honour of knowing your niece,\" Lord Warburton said. \"I  think it's the first time I've heard of her.\"    \"She's a niece of my wife's; Mrs. Touchett brings her to England.\"    Then young Mr. Touchett explained. \"My mother, you know, has been  spending the winter in America, and we're expecting her back. She writes  that she has discovered a niece and that she has invited her to come out  with her.\"    \"I see,--very kind of her,\" said Lord Warburton. Is the young lady  interesting?\"    \"We hardly know more about her than you; my mother has not gone into  details. She chiefly communicates with us by means of telegrams, and her  telegrams are rather inscrutable. They say women don't know how to write  them, but my mother has thoroughly mastered the art of condensation.  'Tired America, hot weather awful, return England with niece, first  steamer decent cabin.' That's the sort of message we get from her--that  was the last that came. But there had been another before, which I think  contained the first mention of the niece. 'Changed hotel, very bad,  impudent clerk, address here. Taken sister's girl, died last year, go to  Europe, two sisters, quite independent.' Over that my father and I  have scarcely stopped puzzling; it seems to admit of so many  interpretations.\"    \"There's one thing very clear in it,\" said the old man; \"she has given  the hotel-clerk a dressing.\"    \"I'm not sure even of that, since he has driven her from the field. We  thought at first that the sister mentioned might be the sister of the  clerk; but the subsequent mention of a niece seems to prove that the  allusion is to one of my aunts. Then there was a question as to whose  the two other sisters were; they are probably two of my late aunt's  daughters. But who's 'quite independent,' and in what sense is the term  used?--that point's not yet settled. Does the expression apply more  particularly to the young lady my mother has adopted, or does it  characterise her sisters equally?--and is it used in a moral or in a  financial sense? Does it mean that they've been left well off, or  that they wish to be under no obligations? or does it simply mean that  they're fond of their own way?\"    \"Whatever else it means, it's pretty sure to mean that,\" Mr. Touchett  remarked.    \"You'll see for yourself,\" said Lord Warburton. \"When does Mrs. Touchett  arrive?\"    \"We're quite in the dark; as soon as she can find a decent cabin.  She may be waiting for it yet; on the other hand she may already have  disembarked in England.\"    \"In that case she would probably have telegraphed to you.\"    \"She never telegraphs when you would expect it--only when you don't,\"  said the old man. \"She likes to drop on me suddenly; she thinks she'll  find me doing something wrong. She has never done so yet, but she's not  discouraged.\"    \"It's her share in the family trait, the independence she speaks of.\"  Her son's appreciation of the matter was more favourable. \"Whatever the  high spirit of those young ladies may be, her own is a match for it. She  likes to do everything for herself and has no belief in any one's power  to help her. She thinks me of no more use than a postage-stamp without  gum, and she would never forgive me if I should presume to go to  Liverpool to meet her.\"    \"Will you at least let me know when your cousin arrives?\" Lord Warburton  asked.    \"Only on the condition I've mentioned--that you don't fall in love with  her!\" Mr. Touchett replied.    \"That strikes me as hard, don't you think me good enough?\"    \"I think you too good--because I shouldn't like her to marry you. She  hasn't come here to look for a husband, I hope; so many young ladies are  doing that, as if there were no good ones at home. Then she's probably  engaged; American girls are usually engaged, I believe. Moreover I'm not  sure, after all, that you'd be a remarkable husband.\"    \"Very likely she's engaged; I've known a good many American girls, and  they always were; but I could never see that it made any difference,  upon my word! As for my being a good husband,\" Mr. Touchett's visitor  pursued, \"I'm not sure of that either. One can but try!\"    \"Try as much as you please, but don't try on my niece,\" smiled the old  man, whose opposition to the idea was broadly humorous.    \"Ah, well,\" said Lord Warburton with a humour broader still, \"perhaps,  after all, she's not worth trying on!\"        CHAPTER II    While this exchange of pleasantries took place between the two Ralph  Touchett wandered away a little, with his usual slouching gait, his  hands in his pockets and his little rowdyish terrier at his heels. His  face was turned toward the house, but his eyes were bent musingly on the  lawn; so that he had been an object of observation to a person who had  just made her appearance in the ample doorway for some moments before  he perceived her. His attention was called to her by the conduct of  his dog, who had suddenly darted forward with a little volley of shrill  barks, in which the note of welcome, however, was more sensible than  that of defiance. The person in question was a young lady, who seemed  immediately to interpret the greeting of the small beast. He advanced  with great rapidity and stood at her feet, looking up and barking hard;  whereupon,"]]]
