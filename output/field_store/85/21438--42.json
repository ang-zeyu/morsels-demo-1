V, 1) which may be both seen  and felt in the throat, and which is commonly called the Adam's Apple.  It protects the interior and more delicate parts of the voice apparatus,  from which circumstance it derives its name of shield cartilage. The  plates of the shield have each at the back two horns, the upper and the  lower. With the upper horns (pl. VI, 1, 2) the shield cartilage is  attached by means of bands (pl. VI, 6, 7) to the corresponding  projections (pl. VI, 4, 5) of the tongue-bone (pl. VI, 3), which has the  shape of a horseshoe. With the lower horns (pl. V, 8), of which on our  diagram we can only see one, it moves upon the ring cartilage as upon a  hinge (pl. V, 9).    [Illustration: PLATE V.    SIDE VIEW OF THE VOICEBOX, OR LARYNX.       1.

ELASTIC BAND UNITING THE SHIELD WITH THE RING.        14. WINDPIPE.    ]    This is a very particular point, and I beg the reader particularly to  notice that if the shield cartilage (pl. V, 5) were gradually drawn  downwards and forwards, the space which we now see between the shield  and the ring (pl. V, 10) would get smaller and smaller, until at last it  quite disappeared; and the distance between the front of the shield (pl.  V, 1) and the highest part of the back of the ring (pl. V, 4) would be  increased.         I may observe here that authorities differ as to whether the shield       moves upon the ring, or the ring upon the shield, and that some       maintain the one is drawn down while the other is tipped upward. It       is sufficient for our purpose, however, that a movement as upon a       hinge takes place, whereby, as explained just now, the distance       between the front of the shield and the highest part of the back of       the ring is increased.    3rd. =The Lid= (pl. V, 11) is an elastic cartilage which serves to close  the voicebox in the act of swallowing, in order to protect it against  any intruding foreign substances. The food we take has to pass over it,  and it sometimes happens, when the lid has not been pulled down tight  enough, that a particle of food enters the voicebox, in which case we  say it has \"gone the wrong way,\" and there is then no peace until the  intruder has been got rid of, generally by a violent fit of coughing.         The lid, it is true, is not the only means of protection which the       voicebox possesses. Professor C. J. Eberth, for instance, mentions       (Archiv fuer pathol: Anatomie, vol. lxiii., p. 135, Berlin, 1868)       the case of a woman who, upon dissection, was found to be entirely       without the free upper part of the lid, which could alone cover the       voicebox. She had never experienced any difficulty in swallowing,       and it is therefore clear that with her the closing of some of the       parts immediately below was sufficient to prevent the food from       getting into the voicebox. But \"the exception proves the rule,\" and       in spite of this and other similar cases, the fact remains that the       lid is obviously the first and most natural protector of the       voicebox.    4th and 5th. We have thus far become acquainted with three cartilages  out of the five. Let us now remove one plate of the shield, as though  cutting it off with a knife (pl. VII, 1 and 2), in order that we may  look inside and see the remaining two cartilages which have hitherto  been hidden by it. These are--    =The Pyramids= (pl. VII, 1 and 2), so called because of their shape. Their  bases are triangular and hollowed out; their sides taper upwards and  terminate in points which are bent slightly backwards, and they have  each two projections, one pointing forwards (pl. VII, 3) and the other  outwards and backwards (pl. VII, 4). It will be convenient to have a  special name for the projections pointing outwards and backwards, which  we will therefore call the Levers.    The Pyramids are attached with their hollow bases to the borders of the  ring (pl. VII, 5), and they are capable of executing rotary movements  with surprising freedom and rapidity. Their inner sides may be made to  run parallel or to diverge. In addition to this they can be drawn  towards each other, or away from each other, so that their summits may  either be widely separated or brought close together.    =The Vocal Ligaments= are two ledges of elastic tissue covered with a very  delicate membrane. Each one of them is connected along its whole length,  on one side, with the shield cartilage. The vocal ligaments are attached  by their hinder ends to those little projections of the pyramids which  point forwards (pl. VII, 3, 3), and by their front ends to the centre of  the shield (pl. VII, 6), where the two plates meet under a more or  less acute angle.    [Illustration: PLATE VII.

WINDPIPE.  ]         These vocal ligaments are generally called the vocal cords, but       this term is misleading, as it implies strings like those, for       instance, of the violin, which are attached only at either end and       are free at every other point. This, however, as we have just seen,       is not the case, the \"Cords\" being free only along their inner       edges. The name \"Vocal Bands,\" which German physiologists have       substituted for \"Vocal Cords,\" does not mend the matter, as it is       open to exactly the same objections. The term \"Vocal Lips,\" also       used by some writers, is, in my judgment, the most unfortunate of       all, because it conveys a totally wrong idea of these parts, as       will be seen from a description in another chapter of their       movements in the act of singing. I have, therefore, sought for a       word which, as a proper description of the thing it is to       designate, shall always call a correct image to the reader's mind,       and as I cannot find a better one than \"Ligament,\" I have adopted       it. I shall consequently in these pages always speak of the       tone-producing element as the \"Vocal Ligaments.\"    The vocal ligaments, having met, are struck by the air blown against  them from below, and being elastic they yield, allowing themselves to be  forced upwards. A little air is thereby set free, and the pressure from  below diminished, in consequence of which the vocal ligaments resume  their former position, and even move a little more downwards. The  renewed pressure of the air once more overcomes the resistance of the  vocal ligaments, which again recede as soon as another escape of air has  taken place, and this process is repeated in rapid and regular  succession. In this manner, and in this manner alone, is vocal tone  produced, whether it be called chest, falsetto, head, or by any other  name.         There are still some writers who teach a different doctrine. For       instance, Miss Sabilla Novello, in her \"Voice and Vocal Art,\"       embodied in the \"Collegiate Vocal Tutor,\" published by Novello,       Ewer, and Co., says on p. 9, that \"The head voice results from the       upper [_i.e._, the false] vocal cords\" (these we shall see       presently), and on page 13, that the falsetto tones \"are created       principally by the action of the trachea [windpipe] and not by that       of the vocal ligaments.\" Another writer, Mr. Rumney Illingworth, in       a paper \"On the Larynx and its Physiology,\" read before the Royal       Medical Society of Edinburgh, on March 3rd, 1879, and communicated       to \"The Students' Journal and Hospital Gazette\" (Vol. IV., No. 91,       p. 151), says that \"The falsetto voice is produced by the laryngeal       sacculi [the pockets of the voicebox, which will be described       further on] acting in the same way as a hazel-nut can be made to       act as a whistle, when the kernel has been extracted through a       small hole in the shell; or as part of the cavity of the mouth acts       in whistling.\" I shall refer to these theories again as the       opportunity for their proper discussion arises; for the present I       will quote a few authorities on the subject.         Dr. CARPENTER, in his \"Human Physiology,\" eighth edition, page 914,       says, \"The true theory of the voice may now be considered as well       established in regard to this essential particular that the sound       is the result of the vibrations of the vocal cords,\" &c.         Professor MARSHALL, in his \"Outlines of Physiology,\" page 255,       says: \"Experiments on living animals show that the vocal cords are       alone the essential organs for the production of voice, for so long       as these remain untouched, although all the other parts in the       interior of the larynx be destroyed, the animal is able to emit       vocal sounds.... The existence of an opening in the larynx of a       living animal, or of man, _above_ the glottis [glottis means the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#6)"],[1,"ht!  He and old MacKelpie took  care to be in time!  Rather low, I thought it.  Mr. St. Leger was reading  a letter.  He had evidently come in but lately, for though he seemed to  be eager about it, he was only at the first page, and I could see that  there were many sheets.  He did not look up when we came in, or till he  had finished the letter; and you may be sure that neither I nor my father  (who, as Head of the House, should have had more respect from him) took  the trouble to go to him.  After all, he is a pauper and a wastrel, and  he has not the honour of bearing our Name.  The General, however, came  forward and greeted us both cordially.  He evidently had forgotten--or  pretended to have--the discourteous way he once treated me, for he spoke  to me quite in a friendly way--I thought more warmly than he did to  father.  I was pleased to be spoken to so nicely, for, after all,  whatever his manners may be, he is a distinguished man--has won the V.C.  and a Baronetcy.  He got the latter not long ago, after the Frontier War  in India.  I was not, however, led away into cordiality myself.  I had  not forgotten his rudeness, and I thought that he might be sucking up to  me.  I knew that when I had my dear Uncle Roger's many millions I should  be a rather important person; and, of course, he knew it too.  So I got  even with him for his former impudence.  When he held out his hand I put  one finger in it, and said, \"How do?\"  He got very red and turned away.  Father and he had ended by glaring at each other, so neither of us was  sorry to be done with him.  All the time Mr. St. Leger did not seem to  see or hear anything, but went on reading his letter.  I thought the old  MacSkelpie was going to bring him into the matter between us, for as he  turned away I heard him say something under his breath.  It sounded like  \"Help!\" but Mr. S--- did not hear.  He certainly no notice of it.    As the MacS--- and Mr. S--- sat quite silent, neither looking at us, and  as father was sitting on the other side of the room with his chin in his  hand, and as I wanted to show that I was indifferent to the two S's, I  took out this notebook, and went on with the Record, bringing it up to  this moment.        THE RECORD--_Continued_.      When I had finished writing I looked over at Rupert.    When he saw us, he jumped up and went over to father and shook his hand  quite warmly.  Father took him very coolly.  Rupert, however, did not  seem to see it, but came towards me heartily.  I happened to be doing  something else at the moment, and at first I did not see his hand; but  just as I was looking at it the clock struck eleven.  Whilst it was  striking Mr. Trent came into the room.  Close behind him came his clerk,  carrying a locked tin box.  There were two other men also.  He bowed to  us all in turn, beginning with me.  I was standing opposite the door; the  others were scattered about.  Father sat still, but Sir Colin and Mr. St.  Leger rose.  Mr. Trent not did shake hands with any of us--not even me.  Nothing but his respectful bow.  That is the etiquette for an attorney, I  understand, on such formal occasions.    He sat down at the end of the big table in the centre of the room, and  asked us to sit round.  Father, of course, as Head of the Family, took  the seat at his right hand.  Sir Colin and St. Leger went to the other  side, the former taking the seat next to the attorney.  The General  knows, of course, that a Baronet takes precedence at a ceremony.  I may  be a Baronet some day myself, and have to know these things.    The clerk took the key which his master handed to him, opened the tin  box, and took from it a bundle of papers tied with red tape.  This he  placed before the attorney, and put the empty box behind him on the  floor.  Then he and the other man sat at the far end of the table; the  latter took out a big notebook and several pencils, and put them before  him.  He was evidently a shorthand-writer.   Mr. Trent removed the tape  from the bundle of papers, which he placed a little distance in front of  him.  He took a sealed envelope from the top, broke the seal, opened the  envelope, and from it took a parchment, in the folds of which were some  sealed envelopes, which he laid in a heap in front of the other paper.  Then he unfolded the parchment, and laid it before him with the outside  page up.  He fixed his glasses, and said:    \"Gentlemen, the sealed envelope which you have seen me open is endorsed  'My Last Will and Testament--ROGER MELTON, _June_, 1906.'  This  document\"--holding it up--\"is as follows:        \"'I Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange in the County of Dorset; of      number one hundred and twenty-three Berkeley Square London; and of      the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains, being of      sound mind do make this my Last Will and Testament on this day Monday      the eleventh day of the month of June in the year of Our Lord one      thousand nine hundred and six at the office of my old friend and      Attorney Edward Bingham Trent in number one hundred and seventy-six      Lincoln's Inn Fields London hereby revoking all other wills that I      may have formerly made and giving this as my sole and last Will      making dispositions of my property as follows:        \"'1.
