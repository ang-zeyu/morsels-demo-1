On the other hand, some  authors go so far as to assert that every chief domestic breed must have  had its wild prototype. This latter view is extremely improbable: it allows  nothing for variation; it passes over the almost monstrous character of  some of the breeds; and it almost necessarily assumes that a large number  of species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog; whereas we  plainly see that wild members of the dog-family are extirpated by human  agency with much difficulty; even so recently as 1710 the wolf existed in  so small an island as Ireland.    The reasons which have led various authors to infer that our dogs have  descended from more than one wild species are as follows. (1/2. Pallas, I  believe, originated this doctrine in 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburgh' 1780 Part  2. Ehrenberg has advocated it, as may be seen in De Blainville's  'Osteographie' page 79. It has been carried to an extreme extent by Col.  Hamilton Smith in the 'Naturalist Library' volumes 9 and 10. Mr. W.C.  Martin adopts it in his excellent 'History of the Dog' 1845; as does Dr.  Morton, as well as Nott and Gliddon, in the United States. Prof. Low, in  his 'Domesticated Animals' 1845 page 666, comes to this same conclusion. No  one has argued on this side with more clearness and force than the late  James Wilson, of Edinburgh, in various papers read before the Highland  Agricultural and Wernerian Societies. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire  ('Hist. Nat. Gen.' 1860 tome 3 page 107), though he believes that most dogs  have descended from the jackal, yet inclines to the belief that some are  descended from the wolf. Prof. Gervais ('Hist. Nat. Mamm.' 1855 tome 2 page  69, referring to the view that all the domestic races are the modified  descendants of a single species, after a long discussion, says, \"Cette  opinion est, suivant nous du moins, la moins probable.\") Firstly, the great  difference between the several breeds; but this will appear of  comparatively little weight, after we shall have seen how great are the  differences between the several races of various domesticated animals which  certainly have descended from a single parent-form. Secondly, the more  important fact, that, at the most anciently known historical periods,  several breeds of the dog existed, very unlike each other, and closely  resembling or identical with breeds still alive.    We will briefly run back through the historical records. The materials are  remarkably deficient between the fourteenth century and the Roman classical  period. (1/3. Berjeau 'The Varieties of the Dog; in old Sculptures and  Pictures' 1863. 'Der Hund' von Dr. F.L. Walther, Giessen 1817 s. 48: this  author seems carefully to have studied all classical works on the subject.  See also Volz 'Beitrage zur Kulturgeschichte' Leipzig 1852 s. 115, 'Youatt  on the Dog' 1845 page 6. A very full history is given by De Blainville in  his 'Osteographie, Canidae.') At this latter period various breeds, namely  hounds, house-dogs, lapdogs, etc, existed; but, as Dr. Walther has  remarked, it is impossible to recognise the greater number with any  certainty. Youatt, however, gives a drawing of a beautiful sculpture of two  greyhound puppies from the Villa of Antoninus. On an Assyrian monument,  about 640 B.C.,an enormous mastiff (1/4. I have seen drawings of this dog  from the tomb of the son of Esar Haddon, and clay models in the British  Museum. Nott and Gliddon, in their 'Types of Mankind' 1854 page 393, give a  copy of these drawings. This dog has been called a Thibetan mastiff, but  Mr. H.A. Oldfield, who is familiar with the so-called Thibet mastiff, and  has examined the drawings in the British Museum, informs me that he  considers them different.) is figured; and according to Sir H. Rawlinson  (as I was informed at the British Museum), similar dogs are still imported  into this same country. I have looked through the magnificent works of  Lepsius and Rosellini, and on the Egyptian monuments from the fourth to the  twelfth dynasties (i.e. from about 3400 B.C. to 2100 B.C.) several  varieties of the dog are represented; most of them are allied to  greyhounds; at the later of these periods a dog resembling a hound is  figured, with drooping ears, but with a longer back and more pointed head  than in our hounds. There is, also, a turnspit, with short and crooked  legs, closely resembling the existing variety; but this kind of monstrosity  is so common with various animals, as with the ancon sheep, and even,  according to Rengger, with jaguars in Paraguay, that it would be rash to  look at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits: Colonel  Sykes (1/5. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' July 12, 1831.) also has described an  Indian pariah dog as presenting the same monstrous character. The most  ancient dog represented on the Egyptian monuments is one of the most  singular; it resembles a greyhound, but has long pointed ears and a short  curled tail: a closely allied variety still exists in Northern Africa; for  Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt (1/6. 'Sporting in Algeria' page 51.) states that  the Arab boar-hound is \"an eccentric hieroglyphic animal, such as Cheops  once hunted with, somewhat resembling the rough Scotch deer-hound; their  tails are curled tight round on their backs, and their ears stick out at  right angles.\" With this most ancient variety a pariah-like dog coexisted.    We thus see that, at a period between four and five thousand years ago,  various breeds, viz. pariah dogs, greyhounds, common hounds, mastiffs,  house-dogs, lapdogs, and turnspits, existed, more or less closely  resembling our present breeds. But there is not sufficient evidence that  any of these ancient dogs belonged to the same identical sub-varieties with  our present dogs. (1/7. Berjeau gives facsimiles of the Egyptian drawings.  Mr. C.L. Martin in his 'History of the Dog' 1845 copies several figures  from the Egyptian monuments, and speaks with much confidence with respect  to their identity with still living dogs. Messrs. Nott and Gliddon ('Types  of Mankind' 1854 page 388) give still more numerous figures. Mr. Gliddon  asserts that a curl-tailed greyhound, like that represented on the most  ancient monuments, is common in Borneo; but the Rajah, Sir J. Brooke,  informs me that no such dog exists there.) As long as man was believed to  have existed on this earth only about 6000 years, this fact of the great  diversity of the breeds at so early a period was an argument of much weight  that they had proceeded from several wild sources, for there would not have  been sufficient time for their divergence and modification. But now that we  know, from the discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of  extinct animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical  changes, that man has existed for an incomparably longer period, and  bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess domestic dogs, the  argument from insufficient time falls away greatly in value.    Long before the period of any historical record the dog was domesticated in  Europe. In the Danish Middens of the Neolithic or Newer Stone period, bones  of a canine animal are embedded, and Steenstrup ingeniously argues that  these belonged to a domestic dog; for a very large proportion of the bones  of birds preserved in the refuse consists of long bones, which it was found  on trial dogs cannot devour. (1/8. These, and the following facts on the  Danish remains, are taken from M. Morlot's most interesting memoir in 'Soc.  Vaudoise des Sc. Nat.' tome 6 1860 pages 281, 299, 320.) This ancient dog  was succeeded in Denmark during the Bronze period by a larger kind,  presenting certain differences, and this again during the Iron period, by a  still larger kind. In Switzerland, we hear from Prof. Rutimeyer (1/9. 'Die  Fauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 117, 162.), that during the Neolithic period  a domesticated dog of middle size existed, which in its skull was about  equally remote from the wolf and jackal, and partook of the characters of  our hounds and setters or spaniels (Jagdhund und Wachtelhund). Rutimeyer  insists strongly on the constancy of form during a very long period of time  of this the most ancient known dog. During the Bronze period a larger dog  appeared, and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of the same age in  Denmark. Remains of two notably distinct varieties of the dog were found by  Schmerling in a cave (1/10. De Blainville 'Osteographie, Canidae.'); but  their age cannot be positively determined.    The existence of a single race, remarkably constant in form during the  whole Neolithic period, is an interesting fact in contrast with what we see  of the changes which the races underwent during the period of the  successive Egyptian monuments, and in contrast with our existing dogs. The  character of this animal during the Neolithic period, as given by  Rutimeyer, supports De Blainville's view that our varieties have descended  from an unknown and extinct form. But we should not forget that we know  nothing with respect to the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the  world. The succession of the different kinds of dogs in Switzerland and  Denmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering tribes  bringing with them their dogs; and this view accords with the belief that  different wild canine animals were domesticated in different regions.  Independently of the immigration of new races of man, we know from the  wide-spread presence of bronze, composed of an alloy of tin, how much  commerce there must have been throughout Europe at an extremely remote  period, and dogs would then probably have been bartered. At the present  time, amongst the savages of the interior of Guiana, the Taruma Indians are  considered the best trainers of dogs, and possess a large breed which they  barter at a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#6)"],[1," rushed between them.    \"Go!\" he cried again to Thaddeus, and at the same time the Queen urged  him to go with her. Then Arline begged to be left alone with her  father that she might have a private word with him. Everybody withdrew  except Thaddeus, wondering what next, and how it would all turn out.    \"Father,\" Arline pleaded when they were alone, \"I am at your feet. If  you love me you will listen. It was Thaddeus who restored me to you;  who has guarded me from harm for twelve years. I cannot give him up,  and to send him away is unworthy of you.\" The Count made a despairing  gesture of dismissal to Thaddeus.    \"But, father, we are already united,\" she urged, referring to the  gipsy marriage. At that the Count was quite horrified.    \"United?--to a strolling fellow like this?\" This was more than  Thaddeus could stand, knowing as he did that he was every bit as good  as the Count--being a Polish noble. True, if he revealed himself, he  might have to pay for it with his life, because he was still reckoned  at large as the enemy of the Emperor, but even so, he decided to tell  the truth about himself for Arline's sake.    \"Listen,\" he cried, stepping nearer to the Count. \"I am not what you  think me. Let this prove to you my birth,\" and he took the old  commission from his pocket where he had carried it for years, and  handed it to the Count. \"This will prove to thee, though I am an  exile, that I am a noble like thyself; and my birth does not separate  me from thy daughter.\" The Count read the paper tremblingly and then  looked long at Thaddeus. Tears came to his eyes.    \"The storms of a nation's strife should never part true lovers,\" he  said softly, at last: \"Thy hand!\"--and taking Thaddeus's hand he  placed it tenderly in that of Arline. As they stood thus united and  happy, the Queen appeared at the window, pointing him out to a gipsy  beside her. The gipsy was about to fire upon Thaddeus at the Queen's  command, when Devilshoof knocked up the gipsy's arm, and the bullet  meant for the lover killed the revengeful Queen.    \"Guard every portal--summon all the guests!\" the Count cried. \"Suspend  all festivities,\" at which the music which had been heard in the  distant salon ceased, and the guests began to assemble. Arline rushed  to the arms of Thaddeus. The Count explained all that had occurred,  the danger Thaddeus had just been in, that he had been given the  Count's daughter, and that congratulations were in order.    As you may believe, after so much fright and danger, everybody was  overjoyed to find that all was well--everybody but Florestein, and he  was certain to be satisfied presently when the banquet began, and he  got some especially fine tit-bit on his own plate!          BEETHOVEN      The most complete, at the same time picturesque, story of Beethoven  and his \"Fidelio\" is told in \"Musical Sketches,\" by Elise Polko, with  all the sentimentality that a German writer can command. Whole  paragraphs might be lifted from that book and included in this sketch,  but the substance of the story shall be told in a somewhat inferior  way.    \"Leonora\" (Fidelio) was composed some time before it was produced.  Ludwig van Beethoven had been urged again and again by his friends to  put the opera before the public, but he always refused.    \"It shall never be produced till I find the woman in whose powers I  have absolute confidence to sing 'Leonora.' She need not be beautiful,  change her costume ten times, nor break her throat with roulades: but  she must have _one_ thing besides her voice.\" He would not disclose  what special quality he demanded; and when his friends persisted in  urging the production of his first, last, and only opera, Beethoven  went into a great rage and declared if the subject were ever mentioned  again, he would burn the manuscript. At one time friends begged him to  hear a new prima donna, Wilhelmina Schroeder, the daughter of a great  actress, believing that in her he would find his \"Leonora.\"    This enraged him still more. The idea of entrusting his beloved  composition to a girl no more than sixteen years old!    His appearance at that time is thus described:    \"At the same hour every afternoon a tall man walked alone on the  so-called Wasserglacis (Vienna). Every one reverentially avoided him.  Neither heat nor cold made him hasten his steps; no passer-by arrested  his eye; he strode slowly, firmly and proudly along, with glance bent  downward, and with hands clasped behind his back. You felt that he was  some extraordinary being, and that the might of genius encircled this  majestic head with its glory. Gray hair grew thickly around his  magnificent brow, but he noticed not the spring breeze that played  sportively among it and pushed it in his eyes. Every child knew: 'that  is Ludwig van Beethoven, who has composed such wondrously beautiful  music.'\"    One day, during one of these outings a fearful storm arose, and he  noticed a beautiful young woman, whom he had frequently seen in his  walks, frightened but standing still without protection from the  weather. She stared at him with such peculiar devotion and entreaty  that he stopped and asked her what she did there in the storm.    She had the appearance of a child, and great simplicity of manner. She  told him she waited to see him. He, being surprised at this,  questioned her, and she declared she was Wilhelmina Schroeder, who  longed for nothing but to sing his Leonora, of which all Vienna had  heard. He took her to his home, she sang the part for him, and at once  he accepted her.    It was she who first sang \"Fidelio,\" and she who had the \"quality\"  that Beethoven demanded: the quality of kindness. It is said that her  face was instinct with gentleness and her voice exquisitely beautiful.  It was almost the last thing that Beethoven heard. His deafness was  already upon him, but he heard her voice; heard his beloved opera  sung, and was so much overcome by the beauty of the young girl's art  that during the performance he fainted.    Of all temperamental men, Beethoven was doubtless the most so, and the  anecdotes written of him are many. He was especially irascible. His  domestic annoyances are revealed freely in his diary: \"Nancy is too  uneducated for a housekeeper--indeed, quite a beast.\" \"My precious  servants were occupied from seven o'clock till ten, trying to light a  fire.\" \"The cook's off again--I shied half a dozen books at her head.\"  \"No soup to-day, no beef, no eggs. Got something from the inn at  last.\" These situations are amusing to read about, decades later, but  doubtless tragic enough at the time to the great composer!    That in financial matters Beethoven was quite practical was  illustrated by his answer to the Prussian Ambassador at Vienna, who  offered to the musician the choice of the glory of having some order  bestowed upon him or fifty ducats. Beethoven took the ducats.    Beautiful as the production of \"Fidelio\" was, it did not escape  criticism from an eminent source. Cherubini was present at the first  performance at the Karnthnerthor Theatre in Vienna, and when asked how  he liked the overture (Leonora in C) he replied:    \"To be honest, I must confess that I could not tell what key it was in  from beginning to end.\"      FIDELIO    CHARACTERS OF THE OPERA    Marcelline (jailer's daughter).  Leonora (under name of Fidelio).  Florestan (her husband and a state prisoner).  Jaquino (porter of the prison).  Pizarro (governor of the prison).  Hernando (the minister).  Rocco (the jailer).  Chorus of soldiers, prisoners and people.    Scene is laid in Spain.    Composer: Beethoven.      ACT I    Marcelline, the jailer's daughter, had been tormented to death for  months by the love-making of her father's porter, Jaquino. In short,  he had stopped her on her way to church, to work, to rest, at all  times, and every time, to make love to her, and finally she was on the  point of consenting to marry him, if only to get rid of him.    \"Marcelline, only name the day, and I vow I'll never make love to you  again,\" said the soft Jaquino. This was so funny that Marcelline  thought he was worth marrying for his drollery; but just as she was  about to make him a happy man by saying \"yes,\" some one knocked upon  the door, and with a laugh she drew away from him:         Oh, joy! once again I am free;       How weary, how weary his love makes me.    Quite disheartened, Jaquino went to open the door.    There had been a time--before a certain stranger named Fidelio had  come to the prison--when Jaquino's absurd love-making pleased  Marcelline, but since the coming of that fine youth Fidelio, she had  thought of little but him. Now, while Jaquino was opening the door,  and she watched his figure (which was not at all fascinating), she  murmured to herself:    \"After all, how perfectly absurd to think of it! I shall never marry  anybody but Fidelio. He is quite the most enchanting fellow I know.\"  At that moment Jaquino returned.    \"What, not a word for me?\" he asked, noting her change of mood.    \"Well, yes, and that word is no, no, no! So go away and let me alone,\"  she answered petulantly.    Now Fidelio was certainly a most beautiful youth, but quite different  from any Marcelline had ever seen. Fidelio observed, with a good deal  of anxiety, that the jailer's daughter was much in love with him, and  there were reasons why that should be inconvenient.    Fidelio, instead of being a fine youth, was a most adoring wife, and  her husband, Florestan, was shut up in that prison for an offence  against its wicked governor, Pizarro. He had been placed there to  starve; and indeed his wife Leonora (Fidelio) had been told that he  was already dead. She had applied, as a youth, for work in the prison,  in order to spy out the truth; to learn if her dear husband were dead  or alive.    There was both good and bad luck in the devotion of the jailer's  daughter. The favourable part of the affair was that"]]]
