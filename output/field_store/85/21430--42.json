Their notes are varied and musical; many of them  resembling the high notes of a fife, and are nearly as loud. They are in  song from March to September, beginning at the first appearance of dawn  and repeating successively twenty or thirty times, and with little  intermission, a favorite strain.    The sprightly figure and gaudy plumage of the Red Bird, his vivacity,  strength of voice, and actual variety of note, and the little expense  with which he is kept, will always make him a favorite.    This species is more numerous to the east of the great range of the  Alleghenies, but is found in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and is numerous in  the lower parts of the Southern States. In January and February they  have been found along the roadsides and fences, hovering together in  half dozens, associating with snow birds, and various kinds of sparrows.  In the northern states they are migratory, and in the southern part of  Pennsylvania they reside during the whole year, frequenting the borders  of rivulets, in sheltered hollows, covered with holly, laurel, and other  evergreens. They love also to reside in the vicinity of fields of Indian  corn, a grain that constitutes their chief and favorite food. The seeds  of apples, cherries, and other fruit are also eaten by them, and they  are accused of destroying bees.    Early in May the Red Bird begins to prepare his nest, which is very  often fixed in a holly, cedar or laurel bush. A pair of Red Birds in  Ohio returned for a number of years to build their nest in a honeysuckle  vine under a portico. They were never disturbed and never failed to rear  a brood of young. The nest was constructed of small twigs, dry weeds,  slips of vine bark, and lined with stalks of fine grass. Four eggs of  brownish olive were laid, and they usually raised two broods in a  season.    In confinement they fade in color, but if well cared for, will live to  a considerable age. They are generally known by the names: Red Bird,  Virginia Red Bird, Virginia Nightingale, and Crested Red Bird. It is  said that the female often sings nearly as well as the male.      THE REDBIRDS.        Two Redbirds came in early May,      Flashing like rubies on the way;      Their joyous notes awoke the day,      And made all nature glad and gay.        Thrice welcome! crested visitants;      Thou doest well to seek our haunts;      The bounteous vine, by thee possessed,      From prying eyes shall keep thy nest.        Sing to us in the early dawn;      'Tis then thy scarlet throats have drawn      Refreshing draughts from drops of dew,      The enchanting concert to renew.        No plaintive notes, we ween, are thine;      They gurgle like a royal wine;      They cheer, rejoice, they quite outshine      Thy neighbor's voice, tho' it's divine.        Free as the circumambient air      Do thou remain, a perfect pair,      To come once more when Proserpine      Shall swell the buds of tree and vine.                                   --C. C. M.     [Illustration: CARDINAL.]    THE RED BIRD.          Is it because he wears a red hat,        That we call him the Cardinal Bird?      Or is it because his voice is so rich        That scarcely a finer is heard?        'Tis neither, but this--I've guessed it, I'm sure--      His dress is a primary color of Nature.      It blends with the Oriole's golden display,      And the garment of Blue Bird completes the array.                                   --C. C.

Dear Sir: I have a copy of your magazine entitled \"Birds,\" and beg to  say that I consider it one of the finest things on the subject that I  have ever seen, and shall be pleased to recommend it to county and city  superintendents of the state.                               Very respectfully,                                       W. J. DAVIDSON,                             State Superintendent Public Instruction.

It should be in the hands of every primary and grammar  teacher. I send herewith copy of \"List of San Francisco Teachers.\"                                                Very respectfully,                                                          M.

NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY,               227 Dearborn Street, Chicago.    Gentlemen: I acknowledge with pleasure the receipt of your publication,  \"Birds,\" with accompanying circulars. I consider it the best on the  subject in existence. I have submitted the circulars and publication to  my teachers, who have nothing to say but praise in behalf of the  monthly.          "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3066"],[0,"The Red Man's Continent: A Chronicle of Aboriginal America (#6)"],[1,"oceans took  the place of the present northern continents. The backwardness of the  indigenous life of Africa shows how an equatorial position retards  evolution. The still more marked backwardness of Australia with its  kangaroos and duck-billed platypuses shows how much greater is the  retardation when a continent is also small and isolated. Today, no less  than in the past, the tetrahedral form of the earth and the relation of  the tetrahedron to the poles and to the equator preserve the conditions  that favor rapid evolution. They are the dominant factors in determining  that America shall be one of the two great centers of civilization.    If North and South America be counted as one major land mass, and  Europe, Asia, and Africa as another, the two present the same general  features. Yet their mountains, plains, and coastal indentations are so  arranged that what is on the east in one is on the west in the other.  Their similarity is somewhat like that of a man's two hands placed palms  down on a table.    On a map of the world place a finger of one hand on the western end of  Alaska and a finger of the other on the northeastern tip of Asia and  follow the main bones of the two continents. See how the chief mountain  systems, the Pacific \"cordilleras,\" trend away from one another,  southeastward and southwestward. In the centers of the continents they  expand into vast plateaus. That of America in the Rocky Mountain region  of the United States reaches a width of over a thousand miles,  while that of Asia in Tibet and western China expands to far greater  proportions.    From the plateaus the two cordilleras swing abruptly Atlantic-ward. The  Eurasian cordillera extends through the Hindu Kush, Caucasus, and Asia  Minor ranges to southern Europe and the Alps. Then it passes on into  Spain and ends in the volcanoes of the Canary Islands. The American  cordillera swings eastward in Mexico and continues as the isolated  ranges of the West Indies until it ends in the volcanoes of Martinique.  Central America appears at first sight to be a continuation of the  great cordillera, but really it is something quite different--a mass  of volcanic material poured out in the gap where the main chain of  mountains breaks down for a space. In neither hemisphere, however, is  the main southward sweep of the mountains really lost. In the Old World  the cordillera revives in the mountains of Syria and southern Arabia and  then runs southward along the whole length of eastern Africa. In America  it likewise revives in the mighty Andes, which take their rise fifteen  hundred miles east of the broken end of the northern cordillera in  Mexico. In the Andes even more distinctly than in Africa the cordillera  forms a mighty wall running north and south. It expands into the plateau  of Peru and Bolivia, just as its African compeer expands into that of  Abyssinia, but this is a mere incident. The main bone, so to speak,  keeps on in each case till it disappears in the great southern ocean.  Even there, however, it is not wholly lost, for it revives in the cold,  lofty continent of Antarctica, where it coalesces once more with the  other great tetrahedral ridges of Africa and Australia.    It is easy to see that these great cordilleras have turned most of the  earth's chief rivers toward the Atlantic and the Arctic Oceans. That  is why these two oceans with an area of only forty-three million square  miles receive the drainage from twenty million square miles of  land, while the far larger Indian and Pacific Oceans with an area of  ninety-one million square miles receive the rivers of only ten million  square miles. The world's streams of civilization, like the rivers of  water, have flowed from the great cordilleras toward the Atlantic. Half  of the world's people, to be sure, are lodged in the relatively small  areas known as China and India on the Pacific side of the Old World  cordillera. Nevertheless the active streams of civilization have flowed  mainly on the other side--the side where man apparently originated. From  the earliest times the mountains have served to determine man's chief  migrations. Their rugged fastnesses hinder human movements and thereby  give rise to a strong tendency to move parallel to their bases. During  the days of primitive man the trend of the mountains apparently directed  his migrations northeastward to Bering Strait and then southeastward  and southward from one end of America to the other. In the same way the  migrations to Europe and Africa which ultimately reached America moved  mainly parallel to the mountains.    From end to end of America the great mountains form a sharp dividing  line. The aboriginal tribes on the Pacific slope are markedly different  from those farther east across the mountains. Brinton sums the case up  admirably:    \"As a rule the tribes of the western coast are not connected with any  east of the mountains. What is more singular, although they  differ surprisingly among themselves in language, they have marked  anthropologic similarities, physical and psychical. Virchow has  emphasized the fact that the skulls from the northern point of  Vancouver's Island reveal an unmistakable analogy to those from the  southern coast of California; and this is to a degree true of many  intermediate points. Not that the crania have the same indices. On the  contrary, they present great and constant differences within the same  tribe; but these differences are analogous one to the other, and on  fixed lines.    \"There are many other physical similarities which mark the Pacific  Indians and contrast them with those east of the mountains. The eyes are  less oblique, the nose flatter, the lips fuller, the chin more pointed,  the face wider. There is more hair on the face and in the axilla, and  the difference between the sexes is much more obvious.    \"The mental character is also in contrast. The Pacific tribes are more  quiet, submissive, and docile; they have less courage, and less of that  untamable independence which is so constant a feature in the history of  the Algonquins and Iroquois.\" *          * D. G. Brinton, \"The American Race,\" pp. 103-4.      Although mountains may guide migrations, the plains are the regions  where people dwell in greatest numbers. The plains in the two great land  masses of the Old World and the New have the same inverse or right- and  left-handed symmetry as the mountains. In the north the vast stretches  from the Mackenzie River to the Gulf of Mexico correspond to the plains  of Siberia and Russia from the Lena to the Black Sea. Both regions have  a vast sweep of monotonous tundras at the north and both become fertile  granaries in the center. Before the white man introduced the horse, the  ox, and iron ploughs, there prevailed an extraordinary similarity in the  habits of the plains Indians from Texas to Alberta. All alike depended  on the buffalo; all hunted him in much the same way; all used his skins  for tents and robes, his bones for tools, and his horns for utensils.  All alike made him the center of their elaborate rituals and dances.  Because the plains of North America were easy to traverse, the  relatively high culture of the ancient people of the South spread into  the Mississippi Valley. Hence the Natchez tribe of Mississippi had a  highly developed form of sun-worship and a well-defined caste system  with three grades of nobility in addition to the common people. Even  farther north, almost to the Ohio River, traces of the sun-worship of  Mexico had penetrated along the easy pathway of the plains.    South of the great granaries of North America and Eurasia the plains are  broken, but occur again in the Orinoco region of South America and  the Sahara of Africa. Thence they stretch almost unbroken toward the  southern end of the continents. In view of the fertility of the plains  it is strange that the centers of civilization have so rarely been  formed in these vast level expanses.    The most striking of the inverse resemblances between America and the  Old World are found along the Atlantic border. In the north of Europe  the White Sea corresponds to Hudson Bay in America. Farther toward the  Atlantic Ocean Scandinavia with its mountains, glaciers, and fiords  is similar to Labrador, although more favored because warmer. Next  the islands of Great Britain occupy a position similar to that of  Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island. But here again the eastern  climate is much more favorable than the western. Although practically  all of Newfoundland is south of England, the American island has only  six inhabitants per square mile, while the European country has six  hundred. To the east of the British Isles the North Sea, the Baltic, and  Lakes Ladoga and Onega correspond in striking fashion to the Gulf of St.  Lawrence, the river of the same name, and the Great Lakes from Ontario  to Superior. Next the indented shores of western France and the  peninsula of Spain resemble our own indented coast and the peninsula  of Florida. Here at last the American regions are as favored as the  European. Farther south the Mediterranean and Black seas penetrate far  into the interior just as does the Gulf of Mexico, and each continent is  nearly cut in two where the canals of Suez and Panama respectively have  been trenched. Finally in the southern continents a long swing eastward  in America balances a similar swing westward in Africa. Thus Cape Saint  Roque and Cape Verde are separated by scarcely 16 degrees of longitude,  although the extreme points of the Gulf of Mexico and the Black Sea are  140 degrees apart. Finally to the south of the equator the continents  swing away from one another once more, preserving everywhere the same  curious inverse relationship.    Even more striking than the inverse resemblance of the New World to the  Old is the direct similarity of North and South America. In physical  form the two continents are"]]]
