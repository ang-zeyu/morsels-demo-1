I went to work in earnest,  and in a short time paid every cent that was so kindly advanced by my  lady patrons of St. Louis. All this time my husband was a source of  trouble to me, and a burden. Too close occupation with my needle had its  effects upon my health, and feeling exhausted with work, I determined to  make a change. I had a conversation with Mr. Keckley; informed him that  since he persisted in dissipation we must separate; that I was going  North, and that I should never live with him again, at least until I had  good evidence of his reform. He was rapidly debasing himself, and  although I was willing to work for him, I was not willing to share his  degradation. Poor man; he had his faults, but over these faults death  has drawn a veil. My husband is now sleeping in his grave, and in the  silent grave I would bury all unpleasant memories of him.    I left St. Louis in the spring of 1860, taking the cars direct for  Baltimore, where I stopped six weeks, attempting to realize a sum of  money by forming classes of young colored women, and teaching them my  system of cutting and fitting dresses. The scheme was not successful,  for after six weeks of labor and vexation, I left Baltimore with  scarcely money enough to pay my fare to Washington. Arriving in the  capital, I sought and obtained work at two dollars and a half per day.  However, as I was notified that I could only remain in the city ten days  without obtaining a license to do so, such being the law, and as I did  not know whom to apply to for assistance, I was sorely troubled. I also  had to have some one vouch to the authorities that I was a free woman.  My means were too scanty, and my profession too precarious to warrant my  purchasing [a] license. In my perplexity I called on a lady for whom I  was sewing, Miss Ringold, a member of Gen. Mason's family, from  Virginia. I stated my case, and she kindly volunteered to render me all  the assistance in her power. She called on Mayor Burritt with me, and  Miss Ringold succeeded in making an arrangement for me to remain in  Washington without paying the sum required for a license; moreover, I  was not to be molested. I rented apartments in a good locality, and soon  had a good run of custom. The summer passed, winter came, and I was  still in Washington. Mrs. Davis, wife of Senator Jefferson Davis, came  from the South in November of 1860, with her husband. Learning that Mrs.  Davis wanted a modiste, I presented myself, and was employed by her on  the recommendation of one of my patrons and her intimate friend, Mrs.  Captain Hetsill. I went to the house to work, but finding that they were  such late risers, and as I had to fit many dresses on Mrs. Davis, I told  her that I should prefer giving half the day to her, working the other  in my own room for some of my other lady patrons. Mrs. D. consented to  the proposition, and it was arranged that I should come to her own house  every day after 12 M. It was the winter before the breaking out of that  fierce and bloody war between the two sections of the country; and as  Mr. Davis occupied a leading position, his house was the resort of  politicians and statesmen from the South. Almost every night, as I  learned from the servants and other members of the family, secret  meetings were held at the house; and some of these meetings were  protracted to a very late hour. The prospects of war were freely  discussed in my presence by Mr. and Mrs. Davis and their friends. The  holidays were approaching, and Mrs. Davis kept me busy in manufacturing  articles of dress for herself and children. She desired to present Mr.  Davis on Christmas with a handsome dressing-gown. The material was  purchased, and for weeks the work had been under way. Christmas eve  came, and the gown had been laid aside so often that it was still  unfinished. I saw that Mrs. D. was anxious to have it completed, so I  volunteered to remain and work on it. Wearily the hours dragged on, but  there was no rest for my busy fingers. I persevered in my task,  notwithstanding my head was aching. Mrs. Davis was busy in the adjoining  room, arranging the Christmas tree for the children. I looked at the  clock, and the hands pointed to a quarter of twelve. I was arranging the  cords on the gown when the Senator came in; he looked somewhat careworn,  and his step seemed to be a little nervous. He leaned against the door,  and expressed his admiration of the Christmas tree, but there was no  smile on his face. Turning round, he saw me sitting in the adjoining  room, and quickly exclaimed:    \"That you, Lizzie! why are you here so late? Still at work; I hope that  Mrs. Davis is not too exacting!\"    \"No, sir,\" I answered. \"Mrs. Davis was very anxious to have this gown  finished to-night, and I volunteered to remain and complete it.\"    \"Well, well, the case must be urgent,\" and he came slowly towards me,  took the gown in his hand, and asked the color of the silk, as he said  the gas-light was so deceptive to his old eyes.    \"It is a drab changeable silk, Mr. Davis,\" I answered; and might have  added that it was rich and handsome, but did not, well knowing that he  would make the discovery in the morning.    He smiled curiously, but turned and walked from the room without another  question. He inferred that the gown was for him, that it was to be the  Christmas present from his wife, and he did not wish to destroy the  pleasure that she would experience in believing that the gift would  prove a surprise. In this respect, as in many others, he always appeared  to me as a thoughtful, considerate man in the domestic circle. As the  clock struck twelve I finished the gown, little dreaming of the future  that was before it. It was worn, I have not the shadow of a doubt, by  Mr. Davis during the stormy years that he was the President of the  Confederate States.    The holidays passed, and before the close of January the war was  discussed in Mr. Davis's family as an event certain to happen in the  future. Mrs. Davis was warmly attached to Washington, and I often heard  her say that she disliked the idea of breaking up old associations, and  going South to suffer from trouble and deprivation. One day, while  discussing the question in my presence with one of her intimate  friends, she exclaimed: \"I would rather remain in Washington and be  kicked about, than go South and be Mrs. President.\" Her friend expressed  surprise at the remark, and Mrs. Davis insisted that the opinion was an  honest one.    While dressing her one day, she said to me: \"Lizzie, you are so very  handy that I should like to take you South with me.\"    \"When do you go South, Mrs. Davis?\" I inquired.    \"Oh, I cannot tell just now, but it will be soon. You know there is  going to be war, Lizzie?\"    \"No!\"    \"But I tell you yes.\"    \"Who will go to war?\" I asked.    \"The North and South,\" was her ready reply. \"The Southern people will  not submit to the humiliating demands of the Abolition party; they will  fight first.\"    \"And which do you think will whip?\"    \"The South, of course. The South is impulsive, is in earnest, and the  Southern soldiers will fight to conquer. The North will yield, when it  sees the South is in earnest, rather than engage in a long and bloody  war.\"    \"But, Mrs. Davis, are you certain that there will be war?\"    \"Certain!--I know it. You had better go South with me; I will take good  care of you. Besides, when the war breaks out, the colored people will  suffer in the North. The Northern people will look upon them as the  cause of the war, and I fear, in their exasperation, will be inclined to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24989"],[0,"A Short Method Of Prayer (#6)"],[1,"we are.    If we become discouraged, we shall grow weaker yet; and reflection upon  our faults produces a vexation which is worse than the sin itself.    A truly humble soul does not marvel at its weakness, and the more it  perceives its wretchedness, the more it abandons itself to God, and  seeks to remain near to Him, knowing how deeply it needs His help.  God's own word to us is, \"I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the  way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye\" (Ps. xxxii.  8).    In distractions or temptations, instead of combating them directly,  which would only serve to augment them, and to wean us from God, with  whom alone we ought to be occupied, we should simply turn away from  them, and draw nearer to God; as a little child, seeing a fierce animal  approaching it, would not stay to fight it, nor even to look at it, but  would run for shelter to its mother's arms, where it would be safe. \"God  is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and  that right early\" (Ps. xlvi. 5).    If we adopt any other course of action, if we attempt to attack our  enemies in our weakness, we shall be wounded, even if we are not  entirely defeated; but remaining in the simple presence of God, we find  ourselves immediately fortified.    This was what David did: he says, \"I have set the Lord always before me;  because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my  heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in  hope.\" It is also said by Moses, \"The Lord shall fight for you, and ye  shall hold your peace\" (Exod. xiv. 14).          CHAPTER XV.    PRAYER AND SACRIFICE EXPLAINED BY THE SIMILITUDE OF A PERFUME--OUR  ANNIHILATION IN THIS SACRIFICE--SOLIDITY AND FRUITFULNESS OF THIS PRAYER  AS SET FORTH IN THE GOSPEL.      Prayer ought to be both petition and sacrifice.    Prayer, according to the testimony of St John, is an incense, whose  perfume rises to God. Therefore it is said in the Revelation (chap.  viii. 3), that an angel held a censer, which contained the incense of  the prayers of saints.    Prayer is an outpouring of the heart in the presence of God. \"I have  poured out my soul before the Lord,\" said the mother of Samuel (1 Sam.  i. 15). Thus the prayers of the Magi at the feet of the infant Jesus in  the stable of Bethlehem were signified by the incense which they  offered.    Prayer is the heat of love, which melts and dissolves the soul, and  carries it to God. In proportion as it melts, it gives out its odour,  and this odour comes from the love which burns it.    This is what the Bride meant when she said, \"While the King sitteth at  His table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof\" (Cant. i. 12).  The table is the heart. When God is there, and we are kept near to Him,  in His presence, this presence of God melts and dissolves the hardness  of our hearts, and as they melt, they give forth their perfume.  Therefore the Bridegroom, seeing His Bride thus melted by the speech of  her Beloved, says, \"Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness,  perfumed with myrrh and frankincense?\" (Cant. iii. 6).    Thus the soul rises up towards its God. But in order to this, it must  suffer itself to be destroyed and annihilated by the force of love. This  is a state of _sacrifice_ essential to the Christian religion, by which  the soul suffers itself to be destroyed and annihilated to render homage  to the sovereignty of God; as it is written, \"The power of the Lord is  great, and He is honoured of the lowly\" (Ecclus. iii. 20). And the  destruction of our own being confesses the sovereign being of God.    We must cease to be, so that the Spirit of the Word may be in us. In  order that He may come to us, we must yield our life to Him, and die to  self that He may live in us, and that we being dead, our life may be  hidden with Christ in God (Col. iii. 3).    \"Come unto me,\" says God, \"all ye that be desirous of me, and fill  yourselves with my fruits\" (Ecclus. xxiv. 19). But how can we be filled  with God? Only by being emptied of self, and going out of ourselves in  order to be lost in Him.    Now, this can never be brought about except by our becoming nothing.  Nothingness is true prayer, which renders to God \"honour, and glory, and  power, for ever and ever\" (Rev. v. 13).    This prayer is the prayer of truth. It is worshipping the Father in  spirit and in truth. In _spirit_, because we are by it drawn out of our  human and carnal action, to enter into the purity of the Spirit, who  prays in us; and in _truth_, because the soul is led into the truth of  the ALL of God, and the NOTHING of the creature.    There are but these two truths, the ALL and the NOTHING. All the rest is  untruth.    We can only honour the ALL of God by our NOTHINGNESS; and we have no  sooner become nothing, than God, who will not suffer us to be empty,  fills us with Himself. Oh, if all knew the blessings which come to the  soul by this prayer, they would be satisfied with no others: it is the  pearl of great price; it is the hidden treasure. He who finds it gladly  sells all that he has to buy it (Matt. xiii. 44, 46). It is the well of  living water, which springs up into everlasting life (John iv. 14). It  is the practice of the pure maxims of the gospel.    Does not Christ Himself tell us that the kingdom of God is within us?  (Luke xvii. 21). This kingdom is set up in two ways. The first is, when  God is so thoroughly master of us that nothing resists Him: then our  heart is truly His kingdom. The other way is, that by possessing God,  who is the sovereign Lord, we possess the kingdom of God, which is the  height of felicity, and the end for which we were created. As it has  been said, _to serve God is to reign_.    The end for which we were created is to enjoy God in this life, and men  do not believe it!          CHAPTER XVI.    THIS STATE OF PRAYER NOT ONE OF IDLENESS, BUT OF NOBLE ACTION, WROUGHT  BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, AND IN DEPENDENCE UPON HIM--THE COMMUNICATION OF  HIS LIFE AND UNION.      Some people, hearing of the prayer of silence, have wrongly imagined  that the soul remains _inactive_, _lifeless_, and _without movement_.    But the truth is, that its action is more noble and more extensive than  it ever was before it entered this degree, since it is moved by God  Himself, and acted upon by His Spirit. St Paul desires that we should be  _led by the Spirit of God_ (Rom. viii. 14). I do not say that there must  be no action, but that we must act in dependence upon the divine  movement. This is admirably set forth by Ezekiel. The prophet saw wheels  which had the spirit of life, and wherever this spirit was to go, they  went; they went on, or stood, or were lifted up, as they were moved,  for the spirit of life was in them: but they never went back (see Ezek.  i. 19-21). It should be the same with the soul: it should suffer itself  to be moved and guided by the living Spirit who is in it, following His  direction, and no other. Now this Spirit will never lead it to go  backwards, that is, to reflect upon the creature, or to lean upon  itself, but always to go forward, pressing continually towards the mark.    This action of the soul is a restful action. When it acts of itself, it  acts with effort; and is therefore more conscious of its action. But  when it acts in dependence upon the Spirit of grace, its action is so  free, so easy, so natural, that it does not seem to act at all. \"He  brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He  delighted in me\" (Ps. xviii. 19).    As soon as the soul has commenced its course towards its centre,[2] from  that moment its action becomes vigorous--that is, its course towards the  centre which attracts it, which infinitely surpasses the velocity of any  other movement.      2. See chap. ix.    It is action then, but an action so _noble_, so _peaceful_, so  _tranquil_, that it seems to the soul as though it were not acting at  all; because it rests, as it were, naturally. When a wheel is only  turning with a moderate speed, it can easily be distinguished; but when  it goes quickly, no part of it can be distinctly seen. So the soul which  remains at rest in God has an action infinitely noble and exalted, yet  very peaceful. The greater its peace, the greater is its velocity,  because it is abandoned to the Spirit, who moves it and makes it act.  This Spirit is God Himself, who draws us, and in drawing makes us run to  Him, as the Bride well knew when she said, \"Draw me, we will run\" (Cant.  i. 4). Draw me, O my Divine Centre, by my inmost heart: my powers and my  sensibilities will run at Thy attraction! This attraction alone is a  balm which heals me, and a perfume which draws. \"We will run,\" she says,  \"because of the savour of Thy good ointments.\" This attracting virtue is  _very strong_ but the soul follows it _very gladly_; and as it is  equally strong and sweet, it attracts by its strength and delights by  its sweetness.    The Bride says, \"Draw me, we will run.\" She speaks of herself, and to  herself: \"Draw _me_;\" there is the unity of the object which is  attracted: \"_We_ will run;\" there is the correspondence of all the  powers and sensibilities which follow in the train of the centre of the  heart.    It is not then a question of remaining in idleness, but of acting _in  dependence upon the Spirit of God_, who animates us, since it is in Him  that \"we live, and move, and have our being\" (Acts xvii. 23). This calm  dependence upon the Spirit of God is absolutely necessary, and causes  the soul in a short time to attain the simplicity and unity in which it  was created. It was created one and simple, like God. In order, then, to  answer the end of our creation, we must quit the multiplicity of our own  actions, to enter into the simplicity and unity of God, in whose image  we were created (Gen. i. 27). The Spirit of God is \"one only,\" \"yet  manifold\" (Wisdom of Solomon vii. 22), and its "]]]
