Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority  over all matters except those delegated to the central government.       Constitutional - a government by or operating under an  authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of  fundamental laws and principles that determines the nature, functions,  and limits of that government.       Constitutional Democracy - a form of government in which the  sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing  constitution.         Constitutional Monarchy - a system of government in which a  monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.       Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is  retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly  through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically  renewed.       Democratic Republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in  the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives  responsible to them.       Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small  clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).       Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.       Federal (Federative) - a form of government in which sovereign  power is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution -  between a central authority and a number of constituent regions  (states, colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some  management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that  the central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals  as well as upon the regional units.       Federal Republic - a state in which the powers of the central  government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,  colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate  sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental  representatives.       Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in  China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous  revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep  in touch with the people.       Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused  by 19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers  as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class  struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists  (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"  to, finally, a classless society - communism.       Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by  Lenin from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final  stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from  developed to underdeveloped countries.       Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in  the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually  for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole  absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with  constitutionally limited authority.       Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small  group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or  power.       Parliamentary Democracy - a political system in which the  legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister,  premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to  party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the  government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to  the parliament.       Parliamentary Government (Cabinet-Parliamentary Government) - a  government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its  leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to  their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly  responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by  the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the  leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer  function.       Parliamentary Monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -  a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a  legislature (parliament).       Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's  elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on  legislation.       Socialism - a government in which the means of planning,  producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government  that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of  property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended  up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.       Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);  the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.       Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as  the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government  subject to religious authority.       Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the  individual to the state by controlling not only all political and  economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its  population.

Household income or consumption by percentage share  Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different  standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys  based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than  surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with  time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country  comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes  see Data codes    Illicit drugs  This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs -  narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and  cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside of medical channels.       Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which  provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes  marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).       Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain  the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with  cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate,  cocoa, and cocoa butter.       Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.       Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety  and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).       Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.       Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance  that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment  in an individual.       Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-  awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants  (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine  analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).       Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).

When they were opened, however, nothing was found  but a little coagulated blood in the ventricle of the heart. Another  experiment was giving a white powder to a cat, in a morsel of mutton.  The cat vomited for half an hour, and was found dead the next day, but  when opened no part of it was found to be affected by the poison. A  second trial of the same poison was made upon a pigeon, which soon died.  When opened, nothing peculiar was found except a little reddish water in  the stomach.\"    These experiments proved that Sainte-Croix was a learned chemist, and  suggested the idea that he did not employ his art for nothing; everybody  recalled the sudden, unexpected deaths that had occurred, and the bonds  from the marquise and from Penautier looked like blood-money. As one of  these two was absent, and the other so powerful and rich that they dared  not arrest him without proofs, attention was now paid to the objection  put in by Lachaussee.    It was said in the objection that Lachaussee had spent seven years in  the service of Sainte-Croix, so he could not have considered the time he  had passed with the d'Aubrays as an interruption to this service. The  bag containing the thousand pistoles and the three bonds for a hundred  livres had been found in the place indicated; thus Lachaussee had a  thorough knowledge of this closet: if he knew the closet, he would know  about the box; if he knew about the box, he could not be an innocent  man. This was enough to induce Madame Mangot de Villarceaux, the  lieutenant's widow, to lodge an accusation against him, and in  consequence a writ was issued against Lachaussee, and he was arrested.    When this happened, poison was found upon him. The trial came on before  the Chatelet. Lachaussee denied his guilt obstinately. The judges  thinking they had no sufficient proof, ordered the preparatory question  to be applied. Mme. Mangot appealed from a judgment which would probably  save the culprit if he had the strength to resist the torture and own to  nothing;    [Note: There were two kinds of question, one before and one after the  sentence was passed. In the first, an accused person would endure  frightful torture in the hope of saving his life, and so would often  confess nothing. In the second, there was no hope, and therefore it was  not worth while to suffer additional pains.]    so, in virtue of this appeal, a judgment, on March 4th, 1673, declared  that Jean Amelin Lachaussee was convicted of having poisoned the  lieutenant and the councillor; for which he was to be broken alive on  the wheel, having been first subjected to the question both ordinary and  extraordinary, with a view to the discovery of his accomplices. At the  same time Madame de Brinvilliers was condemned in default of appearance  to have her head cut off.    Lachaussee suffered the torture of the boot. This was having each leg  fastened between two planks and drawn together in an iron ring, after  which wedges were driven in between the middle planks; the ordinary  question was with four wedges, the extraordinary with eight. At the  third wedge Lachaussee said he was ready to speak; so the question was  stopped, and he was carried into the choir of the chapel stretched on a  mattress, where, in a weak voice--for he could hardly speak--he begged  for half an hour to recover himself. We give a verbatim extract from the  report of the question and the execution of the death-sentence:    \"Lachaussee, released from the question and laid on the mattress, the  official reporter retired. Half an hour later Lachaussee begged that he  might return, and said that he was guilty; that Sainte-Croix told him  that Madame de Brinvilliers had given him the poison to administer to  her brothers; that he had done it in water and soup, had put the reddish  water in the lieutenant's glass in Paris, and the clear water in the pie  at Villequoy; that Sainte-Croix had promised to keep him always, and to  make him a gift of 100 pistolets; that he gave him an account of the  effect of the poisons, and that Sainte-Croix had given him some of the  waters several times. Sainte-Croix told him that the marquise knew  nothing of his other poisonings, but Lachaussee thought she did know,  because she had often spoken to him about his poisons; that she wanted  to compel him to go away, offering him money if he would go; that she  had asked him for the box and its contents; that if Sainte-Croix had  been able to put anyone into the service of Madame d'Aubray, the  lieutenant's widow, he would possibly have had her poisoned also; for he  had a fancy for her daughter.\"    This declaration, which left no room for doubt, led to the judgment that  came next, thus described in the Parliamentary register: \"Report of the  question and execution on the 24th of March 1673, containing the  declarations and confessions of Jean Amelin Lachaussee; the court has  ordered that the persons mentioned, Belleguise, Martin, Poitevin,  Olivier, Veron pere, the wife of Quesdon the wigmaker, be summoned to  appear before the court to be interrogated and heard concerning matters  arising from the present inquiry, and orders that the decree of arrest  against Lapierre and summons against Penautier decreed by the criminal  lieutenant shall be carried out. In Parliament, 27th March 1673.\" In  virtue of this judgment, Penautier, Martin, and Belleguise were  interrogated on the 21st, 22nd, and 24th of April. On the 26th of July,  Penautier was discharged; fuller information was desired concerning  Belleguise, and the arrest of Martin was ordered. On the 24th of March,  Lachaussee had been broken on the wheel. As to Exili, the beginner of it  all, he had disappeared like Mephistopheles after Faust's end, and  nothing was heard of him. Towards the end of the year Martin was  released for want of sufficient evidence. But the Marquise de  Brinvilliers remained at Liege, and although she was shut up in a  convent she had by no means abandoned one, at any rate, of the most  worldly pleasures. She had soon found consolation for the death of  Sainte-Croix, whom, all the same, she had loved so much as to be willing  to kill herself for his sake. But she had adopted a new lover, Theria by  name. About this man it has been impossible to get any information,  except that his name was several times mentioned during the trial. Thus,  all the accusations had, one by one, fallen upon her, and it was  resolved to seek her out in the retreat where she was supposed to be  safe. The mission was difficult and very delicate. Desgrais, one of the  cleverest of the officials, offered to undertake it. He was a handsome  man, thirty-six years old or thereabouts: nothing in his looks betrayed  his connection with the police; he wore any kind of dress with equal  ease and grace, and was familiar with every grade in the social scale,  disguising himself as a wretched tramp or a noble lord. He was just the  right man, so his offer was accepted.    He started accordingly for Liege, escorted by several archers, and,  fortified by a letter from the king addressed to the Sixty of that town,  wherein Louis xiv demanded the guilty woman to be given up for  punishment. After examining the letter, which Desgrais had taken pains  to procure, the council authorised the extradition of the marquise.    This was much, but it was not all. The marquise, as we know, had taken  refuge in a convent, where Desgrais dared not arrest her by force, for  two reasons: first, because she might get information beforehand, and  hide herself in one of the cloister retreats whose secret is known only  to the superior; secondly, because Liege was so religious a town that  the event would produce a great sensation: the act might be looked upon  as a sacrilege, and might bring about a popular rising, during which the  marquise might possibly contrive to escape. So Desgrais paid a visit to  his wardrobe, and feeling that an abbe's dress would best free him from  suspicion, he appeared at the doors of the convent in the guise of a  fellow-countryman just returned from Rome, unwilling to pass through  Liege without presenting his compliments to the lovely and unfortunate  marquise. Desgrais had just the manner of the younger son of a great  house: he was as flattering as a courtier, as enterprising as a  musketeer. In this first visit he made himself attractive by his wit and  his audacity, so much so that more easily than he had dared to hope, he  got leave to pay a second call. The second visit was not long delayed:  Desgrais presented himself the very next day. Such eagerness was  flattering to the marquise, so Desgrais was received even better than  the night before. She, a woman of rank and fashion, for more than a year  had been robbed of all intercourse with people of a certain set, so with  Desgrais the marquise resumed her Parisian manner. Unhappily the  charming abbe was to leave Liege in a few days; and on that account he  became all the more pressing, and a third visit, to take place next day,  was formally arranged. Desgrais was punctual: the marquise was  impatiently waiting him; but by a conjunction of circumstances that  Desgrais had no doubt arranged beforehand, the amorous meeting was  disturbed two or three times just as they were getting more intimate and  least wanting to be observed. Desgrais complained of these tiresome  checks; besides, the marquise and he too would be compromised: he owed  concealment to his cloth: He begged her to grant him a rendezvous  outside the town, in some deserted walk, where there would be no fear of  their being recognised or followed: the marquise hesitated no longer  than would serve to put a price on the favour she was granting, and the  rendezvous was fixed for the same evening.    The evening came: both waited with the same impatience, but with very"]]]
