N.B.--For the stripes in this case, white sugar is often used and looks  much better, but to do so two pans are necessary, one may be a small  saucepan to boil two pounds. The white sugar is boiled separately in the  ordinary way, otherwise, process, would be exactly as described.      LEMON STICKS.      Pulled yellow centre with yellow case.      8 lbs.

The first week or two after their arrival is spent by the young ones in  getting acquainted, for each crow must know personally all the others in  the band. Their parents meanwhile have time to rest a little after the  work of raising them, for now the youngsters are able to feed themselves  and roost on a branch in a row, just like big folks.    In a week or two the moulting season comes. At this time the old crows  are usually irritable and nervous, but it does not stop them from  beginning to drill the youngsters, who, of course, do not much enjoy the  punishment and nagging they get so soon after they have been mamma's own  darlings. But it is all for their good, as the old lady said when she  skinned the eels, and old Silverspot is an excellent teacher. Sometimes  he seems to make a speech to them. What he says I cannot guess, but  judging by the way they receive it, it must be extremely witty. Each  morning there is a company drill, for the young ones naturally drop into  two or three squads according to their age and strength. The rest of the  day they forage with their parents.    When at length September comes we find a great change. The rabble of  silly little crows have begun to learn sense. The delicate blue iris of  their eyes, the sign of a fool-crow, has given place to the dark brown  eye of the old stager. They know their drill now and have learned sentry  duty. They have been taught guns and traps and taken a special course in  wireworms and green-corn. They know that a fat old farmer's wife is much  less dangerous, though so much larger, than her fifteen-year-old son,  and they can tell the boy from his sister. They know that an umbrella is  not a gun, and they can count up to six, which is fair for young crows,  though Silverspot can go up nearly to thirty. They know the smell of  gunpowder and the south side of a hemlock-tree, and begin to plume  themselves upon being crows of the world. They always fold their wings  three times after alighting, to be sure that it is neatly done. They  know how to worry a fox into giving up half his dinner, and also that  when the kingbird or the purple martin assails them they must dash into  a bush, for it is as impossible to fight the little pests as it is for  the fat apple-woman to catch the small boys who have raided her basket.  All these things do the young crows know; but they have taken no lessons  in egg-hunting yet, for it is not the season. They are unacquainted with  clams, and have never tasted horses' eyes, or seen sprouted corn, and  they don't know a thing about travel, the greatest educator of all. They  did not think of that two months ago, and since then they have thought  of it, but have learned to wait till their betters are ready.    September sees a great change in the old crows, too, Their moulting is  over. They are now in full feather again and proud of their handsome  coats. Their health is again good, and with it their tempers are  improved. Even old Silverspot, the strict teacher, becomes quite jolly,  and the youngsters, who have long ago learned to respect him, begin  really to love him.    He has hammered away at drill, teaching them all the signals and words  of command in use, and now it is a pleasure to see them in the early  morning.    'Company I!' the old chieftain would cry in crow, and Company I would  answer with a great clamor.    'Fly!' and himself leading them, they would all fly straight forward.    'Mount!' and straight upward they turned in a moment.    'Bunch!' and they all massed into a dense black flock.    'Scatter!' and they spread out like leaves before the wind.    'Form line!' and they strung out into the long line of ordinary flight.    'Descend!' and they all dropped nearly to the ground.    'Forage!' and they alighted and scattered about to feed, while two of  the permanent sentries mounted duty--one on a tree to the right, the  other on a mound to the far left. A minute or two later Silverspot  would cry out, 'A man with a gun!' The sentries repeated the cry and  the company flew at once in open order as quickly as possible toward the  trees. Once behind these, they formed line again in safety and returned  to the home pines.    Sentry duty is not taken in turn by all the crows, but a certain number  whose watchfulness has been often proved are the perpetual sentries, and  are expected to watch and forage at the same time. Rather hard on them  it seems to us, but it works well and the crow organization is admitted  by all birds to be the very best in existence.    Finally, each November sees the troop sail away southward to learn new  modes of life, new landmarks and new kinds of food, under the guidance  of the everwise Silverspot.    III    There is only one time when a crow is a fool, and that is at night.  There is only one bird that terrifies the crow, and that is the owl.  When, therefore, these come together it is a woeful thing for the sable  birds. The distant hoot of an owl after dark is enough to make them  withdraw their heads from under their wings, and sit trembling and  miserable till morning. In very cold weather the exposure of their faces  thus has often resulted in a crow having one or both of his eyes frozen,  so that blindness followed and therefore death. There are no hospitals  for sick crows.    But with the morning their courage comes again, and arousing themselves  they ransack the woods for a mile around till they find that owl, and if  they do not kill him they at least worry him half to death and drive him  twenty miles away.    In 1893 the crows had come as usual to Castle Frank. I was walking in  these woods a few days afterward when I chanced upon the track of a  rabbit that had been running at full speed over the snow and dodging  about among the trees as though pursued. Strange to tell, I could see no  track of the pursuer. I followed the trail and presently saw a drop of  blood on the snow, and a little farther on found the partly devoured  remains of a little brown bunny. What had killed him was a mystery until  a careful search showed in the snow a great double-toed track and a  beautifully pencilled brown feather. Then all was clear--a horned owl.  Half an hour later, in passing again by the place, there, in a tree,  within ten feet of the bones of his victim, was the fierce-eyed owl  himself. The murderer still hung about the scene of his crime. For once  circumstantial evidence had not lied. At my approach he gave a guttural  'grrr-oo' and flew off with low flagging flight to haunt the distant  sombre woods.    Two days afterward, at dawn, there was a great uproar among the crows.  I went out early to see, and found some black feathers drifting over the  snow. I followed up the wind in the direction from which they came and  soon saw the bloody remains of a crow and the great double-toed track  which again told me that the murderer was the owl. All around were signs  of the struggle, but the fell destroyer was too strong. The poor crow  had been dragged from his perch at night, when the darkness bad put him  at a hopeless disadvantage.    I turned over the remains, and by chance unburied the head--then started  with an exclamation of sorrow. Alas! It was the head of old Silverspot.  His long life of usefulness to his tribe was over--slain at last by the  owl that he had taught so many hundreds of young crows to beware of.    The old nest on the Sugar Loaf is abandoned now. The crows still come  in spring-time to Castle Frank, but without their famous leader their  numbers are dwindling, and soon they will be seen no more about the old  pine-grove in which they and their forefathers had lived and learned for  ages.          RAGGYLUG, The Story of a Cottontail Rabbit    RAGGYLUG, or Rag, was the name of a young cottontail rabbit. It was  given him from his torn and ragged ear, a life-mark that he got in his  first adventure. He lived with his mother in Olifant's Swamp, where I  made their acquaintance and gathered, in a hundred different ways, the  little bits of proof and scraps of truth that at length enabled me to  write this history.    Those who do not know the animals well may think I have humanized them,  but those who have lived so near them as to know somewhat of their ways  and their minds will not think so.    Truly rabbits have no speech as we understand it, but they have a way of  conveying ideas by a system of sounds, signs, scents, whisker-touches,  movements, and example that answers the purpose of speech; and it must  be remembered that though in telling this story I freely translate from  rabbit into English, I repeat nothing that they did not say.    I    The rank swamp grass bent over and concealed the snug nest where  Raggylug's mother had hidden him. She had partly covered him with some  of the bedding, and, as always, her last warning was to lie low and say  nothing, whatever happens. Though tucked in bed, he was wide awake and  his bright eyes were taking in that part of his little green world that  was straight above. A bluejay and a red-squirrel, two notorious thieves,  were loudly berating each other for stealing, and at one time Rag's  home bush was the centre of their fight; a yellow warbler caught a blue  butterfly but six inches from his nose, and a scarlet and black ladybug,  serenely waving her knobbed feelers, took a long walk up one grass-blade,  down another, and across the nest and over Rag's face--and yet he never  moved nor even winked.    After a while he heard a strange rustling of the leaves in the near  thicket. It was an odd, continuous sound, and though it went this way  and that way and came ever nearer, there was no patter of feet with it.  Rag had lived his whole life in the Swamp (he was three weeks old) and  yet had never heard anything like this. Of course his curiosity was  greatly aroused. His mother had cautioned him to lie low, but that  was understood to be in case of danger, and this strange"]]]
