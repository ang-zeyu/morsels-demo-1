To effect this, the eccentric is set  more than 90 deg. in advance--that is, more than what the engineers call  _square_. Fig. 26 shows such an arrangement. The angle between E and  E^1 is called the _angle of advance_. Referring to the valve, you will  see that it has opened an appreciable amount, though the piston has not  yet started on its rightwards journey.      \"LAP\" OF THE VALVE--EXPANSION OF STEAM.    In the simple form of valve that appears in Fig. 24, the valve faces are  just wide enough to cover the steam ports. If the eccentric is not  _square_ with the crank, the admission of steam lasts until the very end  of the stroke; if set a little in advance--that is, given _lead_--the  steam is cut off before the piston has travelled quite along the  cylinder, and readmitted before the back stroke is accomplished. Even  with this lead the working is very uneconomical, as the steam goes to  the exhaust at practically the same pressure as that at which it entered  the cylinder. Its property of _expansion_ has been neglected. But  supposing that steam at 100 lbs. pressure were admitted till  half-stroke, and then suddenly cut off, the expansive nature of the  steam would then continue to push the piston out until the pressure had  decreased to 50 lbs. per square inch, at which pressure it would go to  the exhaust. Now, observe that all the work done by the steam after the  cut-off is so much power saved. The _average_ pressure on the piston is  not so high as in the first case; still, from a given volume of 100 lbs.  pressure steam we get much more _work_.      HOW THE CUT-OFF IS MANAGED.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--A slide-valve with \"lap.\"]    [Illustration: FIG. 28.]    Look at Fig. 27. Here we have a slide-valve, with faces much wider than  the steam ports. The parts marked black, P P, are those corresponding to  the faces of the valves shown in previous diagrams (p. 54). The shaded  parts, L L, are called the _lap_. By increasing the length of the lap we  increase the range of expansive working. Fig. 28 shows the piston full  to the left; the valve is just on the point of opening to admit steam  behind the piston. The eccentric has a throw equal to the breadth of a  port + the lap of the valve. That this must be so is obvious from a  consideration of Fig. 27, where the valve is at its central position.  Hence the very simple formula:--Travel of valve = 2 x (lap + breadth of  port). The path of the eccentric's centre round the centre of the shaft  is indicated by the usual dotted line (Fig. 28). You will notice that  the \"angle of advance,\" denoted by the arrow A, is now very  considerable. By the time that the crank C has assumed the position of  the line S, the eccentric has passed its dead point, and the valve  begins to travel backwards, eventually returning to the position shown  in Fig. 28, and cutting off the steam supply while the piston has still  a considerable part of its stroke to make. The steam then begins to work  expansively, and continues to do so until the valve assumes the position  shown in Fig. 27.    If the valve has to have \"lead\" to admit steam _before_ the end of the  stroke to the other side of the piston, the _angle of advance_ must be  increased, and the eccentric centre line would lie on the line E^2.  Therefore--total angle of advance = angle for _lap_ and angle for  _lead_.      LIMIT OF EXPANSIVE WORKING.    Theoretically, by increasing the _lap_ and cutting off the steam earlier  and earlier in the stroke, we should economize our power more and more.  But in practice a great difficulty is met with--namely, that _as the  steam expands its temperature falls_. If the cut-off occurs early, say  at one-third stroke, the great expansion will reduce the temperature of  the metal walls of the cylinder to such an extent, that when the next  spirt of steam enters from the other end a considerable proportion of  the steam's energy will be lost by cooling. In such a case, the  difference in temperature between admitted steam and exhausted steam is  too great for economy. Yet we want to utilize as much energy as  possible. How are we to do it?      COMPOUND ENGINES.    In the year 1853, John Elder, founder of the shipping firm of Elder and  Co., Glasgow, introduced the _compound_ engine for use on ships. The  steam, when exhausted from the high-pressure cylinder, passed into  another cylinder of equal stroke but larger diameter, where the  expansion continued. In modern engines the expansion is extended to  three and even four stages, according to the boiler pressure; for it is  a rule that the higher the initial pressure is, the larger is the number  of stages of expansion consistent with economical working.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Sketch of the arrangement of a  triple-expansion marine engine. No valve gear or supports, etc., shown.]    In Fig. 29 we have a triple-expansion marine engine. Steam enters the  high-pressure cylinder[4] at, say, 200 lbs. per square inch. It exhausts  at 75 lbs. into the large pipe 2, and passes to the intermediate  cylinder, whence it is exhausted at 25 lbs. or so through pipe 3 to the  low-pressure cylinder. Finally, it is ejected at about 8 lbs. per square  inch to the condenser, and is suddenly converted into water; an act  which produces a vacuum, and diminishes the back-pressure of the exhaust  from cylinder C. In fact, the condenser exerts a _sucking_ power on the  exhaust side of C's piston.      ARRANGEMENT OF EXPANSION ENGINES.    In the illustration the cranks are set at angles of 120 deg., or a third  of a circle, so that one or other is always at or near the position of  maximum turning power. Where only two stages are used the cylinders are  often arranged _tandem_, both pistons having a common piston rod and  crank. In order to get a constant turning movement they must be mounted  separately, and work cranks set at right angles to one another.      COMPOUND LOCOMOTIVES.    In 1876 Mr. A. Mallet introduced _compounding_ in locomotives; and the  practice has been largely adopted. The various types of \"compounds\" may  be classified as follows:--(1) One low-pressure and one high-pressure  cylinder; (2) one high-pressure and two low-pressure; (3) one  low-pressure and two high-pressure; (4) two high-pressure and two  low-pressure. The last class is very widely used in France, America, and  Russia, and seems to give the best results. Where only two cylinders are  used (and sometimes in the case of three and four), a valve arrangement  permits the admission of high-pressure steam to both high and  low-pressure cylinders for starting a train, or moving it up heavy  grades.      REVERSING GEARS.    [Illustration: FIGS. 30, 31, 32.--Showing how a reversing gear alters  the position of the slide-valve.]    The engines of a locomotive or steamship must be reversible--that is,  when steam is admitted to the cylinders, the engineer must be able to  so direct it through the steam-ways that the cranks may turn in the  desired direction. The commonest form of reversing device (invented by  George Stephenson) is known as Stephenson's Link Gear. In Fig. 30 we  have a diagrammatic presentment of this gear. E^1 and E^2 are two  eccentrics set square with the crank at opposite ends of a diameter.  Their rods are connected to the ends of a link, L, which can be raised  and lowered by means of levers (not shown). B is a block which can  partly revolve on a pin projecting from the valve rod, working through  a guide, G. In Fig. 31 the link is half raised, or in \"mid-gear,\" as  drivers say. Eccentric E^1 has pushed the lower end of the link fully  back; E^2 has pulled it fully forward; and since any movement of the  one eccentric is counterbalanced by the opposite movement of the other,  rotation of the eccentrics would not cause the valve to move at all, and  no steam could be admitted to the cylinder.    Let us suppose that Fig. 30 denotes one cylinder, crank, rods, etc., of  a locomotive. The crank has come to rest at its half-stroke; the  reversing lever is at the mid-gear notch. If the engineer desires to  turn his cranks in an anti-clockwise direction, he _raises_ the link,  which brings the rod of E^1 into line with the valve rod and presses  the block _backwards_ till the right-hand port is uncovered (Fig. 31).  If steam be now admitted, the piston will be pushed towards the left,  and the engine will continue to run in an anti-clockwise direction. If,  on the other hand, he wants to run the engine the other way, he would  _drop_ the link, bringing the rod of E^2 into line with the valve rod,  and drawing V _forward_ to uncover the rear port (Fig. 32). In either  case the eccentric working the end of the link remote from B has no  effect, since it merely causes that end to describe arcs of circles of  which B is the centre.      \"LINKING UP.\"    If the link is only partly lowered or raised from the central position  it still causes the engine to run accordingly, but the movement of the  valve is decreased. When running at high speed the engineer \"links up\"  his reversing gear, causing his valves to cut off early in the stroke,  and the steam to work more expansively than it could with the lever at  _full_, or _end_, gear; so that this device not only renders an engine  reversible, but also gives the engineer an absolute command over the  expansion ratio of the steam admitted to the cylinder, and furnishes a  method of cutting off the steam altogether. In Figs. 30, 31, 32, the  valve has no lap and the eccentrics are set square. In actual practice  the valve faces would have \"lap\" and the eccentric \"lead\" to correspond;  but for the sake of simplicity neither is shown.      OTHER GEARS.    In the Gooch gear for reversing locomotives the link does not shift, but  the valve rod and its block is raised or lowered. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28569"],[0,"Makers of Many Things (#6)"],[1,"do this work. In one of the  best of them the operator sits before a keyboard much like that of a  typewriter. When he presses key _a_, for instance, a mould or matrix  of the letter _a_ is set free from a tube of _a_'s, and slides down to  its place in the stick. At the end of the line, the matrices forming  it are carried in front of a slot where melted type metal from a  reservoir meets them. Thus a cast is made of the matrices, and from  this cast the printing is done. This machine is called a linotype  because it casts a whole line of type at a time.    Most book work is done on the monotype machine. When a manuscript  goes to the press to be set up in this way, the copy is given to the  keyboard operator who sets it up on a machine which looks much like  a typewriter. Instead of writing letters, however, the machine punches  tiny holes in a strip of paper which is wound on a roll. When the  roll is full it goes to the casting room where it is put on another  machine containing hot type metal and bronze matrices from which the  letters of the words are to be cast. The holes in the paper guide the  machine to make the type much as a perforated music roll guides a  piano to play a tune. The reason why the machine is called a monotype  is that the letters are made one at a time, and _monos_ is the Greek  word for _one_.    By the linotype and monotype machines type can be set in a \"galley,\"  a narrow tray about two feet long, with ledges on three sides. When a  convenient number of these galleys have been filled, long slips are  printed from them called \"galley proofs.\" These have wide margins, but  the print is of the width that the page of the book will be. They are  read by the proof-readers, and all such mistakes as the slipping in  of a wrong letter, or a broken type, the repetition of a word, or the  omission of space between words are corrected. Then the proof goes to  the author, who makes any changes in his part of the work which seem  to him desirable; and it is also read by some member of the editorial  department. If there are many changes to be made, another proof is  usually taken and sent to the author.    The reason for this extreme carefulness is that it costs much less to  make changes in the galley proof than in the \"page proof.\" This latter  is made by dividing the galley into pages, leaving space for the  beginnings of chapters and for pictures, if any are to appear on the  printed pages, and setting up the numbers of the pages and their  running titles. Page proof also goes to proof-readers and to the  author. Corrections on page proof are more expensive than on galley  proof because adding or striking out even a few words may make it  necessary to change the arrangement on every page to the end of the  chapter.    Years ago all books were printed directly from the type; and some are  still printed so. After printing, the letters were returned to their  compartments. If a second edition was called for, the type had to be  set again. Now, however, books are generally printed not from type,  but from a copper model of the type. To make this, an impression of  the page of type is made in wax and covered with graphite, which will  conduct electricity. These moulds are hung in a bath of copper  sulphate, where there are also large plates of copper. A current of  electricity is passed through it, and wherever the graphite is, a  shell of copper is deposited, which is exactly like the face of the  type. This shell is very thin, but it is made strong by adding a heavy  back of melted metal. From these plates the books are printed. A  correction made in the plate is more expensive than it would have been  if made in the galley or in the page, because sawing out a word or a  line is slow, delicate work; and even if one of the same length is  substituted, the types spelling it have to be set up, a small new  plate cast, and soldered in.    [Illustration: _Courtesy The Riverside Press._    WHERE THIS BOOK WAS PRINTED    The girls are feeding big sheets of paper into the presses, thirty-two  pages being printed at one time. The paper is fed into many modern  presses by means of a machine attached to the press. The pressmen see  that the printing is done properly.]    Printing one page at a time would be altogether too slow; therefore  the plates are arranged in such a way that sixteen, thirty-two, or  sometimes sixty-four pages can be printed on one side of the paper,  and the same number on the other side. Every page must come in its  proper place when the sheet is folded for binding. Try to arrange a  sheet of even sixteen pages, eight on each side, so that when it is  folded every page will be in the right place with its printing right  side up, and you will find that it is not very easy until you have had  considerable experience. If the sheet is folded into four leaves, the  book is called a \"quarto,\" or \"4to\"; if into eight, it is an \"octavo,\"  or \"8vo\"; if into twelve, a \"duodecimo,\" or \"12mo.\" Books are  sometimes advertised in these terms; but they are not definite,  because the sheets of the different varieties of paper vary in size.  Of late years, publishers have often given the length and width of  their books in inches.    After the sheets come from the press, they are folded to page size.  Sometimes this is done by hand, but more often by a folding machine  through which the sheet of paper travels, meeting blunt knives which  crease it and fold it. If you look at the top of a book you will see  that the leaves are put together in groups or \"signatures.\" These  signatures usually contain eight, sixteen, or thirty-two pages. If  the paper is very thick, not more than eight leaves will be in a  signature; if of ordinary thickness, sixteen are generally used. The  signatures are piled up in order, and a \"gatherer\" collects one from  each pile for every book.    The book is now gathered and \"smashed,\" or pressed enough to make it  solid and firm for binding. Next the signatures are sewed and the book  is trimmed so the edges will be even. If the edges are to be gilded,  the book is put in a gilding press and a skillful workman covers the  edges with a sizing made of the white of eggs. Gold leaf is then laid  upon them and they are burnished with tools headed with agate and  bloodstone or instruments of various sorts until they are bright.  Sometimes the edges are \"marbled,\" and this is an interesting process  to watch. On the surface of a vat of thin sizing the marbler drops a  little of many colors of paint. Then he draws a comb lightly across  the surface, making all sorts of odd figures, no two alike. The book  is held tight and the edges are allowed to touch the sizing. All these  odd figures are now transferred to the edges of the leaves and will  stand a vast amount of hard use before they will wear off.    Thus far the book is flat at the edges of the leaves and at the back.  Books are sometimes bound in this way, but the backs are usually  rounded into an outward curve, and the fronts into an inward curve.  This is done by a machine. At each end of the outward curve a deep  groove is pressed to receive the cover. To make the covers of a  cloth-bound book, two pieces of pasteboard of the right size are cut  and laid upon a piece of cloth coated with glue. The edges of the  cloth are turned over and pressed down, as you can often see if the  paper lining of the cover is not too heavy. The cover needs now only  its decorations to be complete. A die is made for these, and the  lettering and ornamentation are stamped on in colors. If more than one  color is used, a separate die has to be made for each. If this work  is to be done in gold, the design is stamped on lightly and sizing  made of white of eggs is brushed on wherever the gold is to come. Gold  leaf is laid upon this sizing, and the cover is stamped again. The  same die is used, but this time it is hot enough to make the gold and  egg stick firmly to the cover. To put the cover on, a piece of muslin  called a \"super\" is glued to the back of the book with its ends  projecting over the sides, and a strip of cartridge paper is glued  over the super. Then the book is pasted into the cover. It is now kept  under heavy pressure for a number of hours until it is thoroughly dry  and ready to be sent away for sale.    So it is that a well-made cloth-bound book is manufactured.  Leather-bound books are more expensive, not only because their  materials cost more, but also because the greater part of the work of  binding and decorating has to be done by hand. If a book is to be  illustrated, this must also be attended to, the number and style of  the pictures decided upon, and the artist engaged before the book is  put in press, in order that there may be no delay in completing it.    Many publishers do not print at all, but have their work done at some  printing establishment. Where all the making of a book, however, from  manuscript to cover, is in the hands of one firm, there is a certain  fellow-feeling among the different departments, and a wholesome pride  in making each one of \"our books\" as excellent as possible in every  detail. As one of the women workers in such an establishment said to  me, \"I often think that we become almost as interested in a book as  the author is.\"          VI    FROM GOOSE QUILLS TO FOUNTAIN PENS AND LEAD PENCILS      Whenever there was a convenient goosepond on the way to school, the  children of less than one hundred years ago used to stop there to hunt  for goose quills. They carried these to the teacher, and with his  penknife--which took its name from the work it did--he cut them into  the shape of pens. The points soon wore out, and \"Teacher, will you  please mend my pen?\" was a frequent request.    When people began to make pens of steel, they made them as nearly like  quill pens as possible, with pen and holder all in one. These were  called \"barrel pens.\" They were stiff, hard, and expensive, "]]]
