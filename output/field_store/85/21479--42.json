Now if the Sun's circular Image Y [in  _Fig._ 15.] which is made by an unrefracted beam of Light was by any  Dilation of the single Rays, or by any other irregularity in the  Refraction of the first Prism, converted into the oblong Spectrum, PT:  then ought every Circle AG, BH, CJ, &c. in that Spectrum, by the cross  Refraction of the second Prism again dilating or otherwise scattering  the Rays as before, to be in like manner drawn out and transformed into  an oblong Figure, and thereby the breadth of the Image PT would be now  as much augmented as the length of the Image Y was before by the  Refraction of the first Prism; and thus by the Refractions of both  Prisms together would be formed a four square Figure _p[Greek:  p]t[Greek: t]_, as I described above. Wherefore since the breadth of the  Spectrum PT is not increased by the Refraction sideways, it is certain  that the Rays are not split or dilated, or otherways irregularly  scatter'd by that Refraction, but that every Circle is by a regular and  uniform Refraction translated entire into another Place, as the Circle  AG by the greatest Refraction into the place _ag_, the Circle BH by a  less Refraction into the place _bh_, the Circle CJ by a Refraction still  less into the place _ci_, and so of the rest; by which means a new  Spectrum _pt_ inclined to the former PT is in like manner composed of  Circles lying in a right Line; and these Circles must be of the same  bigness with the former, because the breadths of all the Spectrums Y, PT  and _pt_ at equal distances from the Prisms are equal.    I considered farther, that by the breadth of the hole F through which  the Light enters into the dark Chamber, there is a Penumbra made in the  Circuit of the Spectrum Y, and that Penumbra remains in the rectilinear  Sides of the Spectrums PT and _pt_. I placed therefore at that hole a  Lens or Object-glass of a Telescope which might cast the Image of the  Sun distinctly on Y without any Penumbra at all, and found that the  Penumbra of the rectilinear Sides of the oblong Spectrums PT and _pt_  was also thereby taken away, so that those Sides appeared as distinctly  defined as did the Circumference of the first Image Y. Thus it happens  if the Glass of the Prisms be free from Veins, and their sides be  accurately plane and well polished without those numberless Waves or  Curles which usually arise from Sand-holes a little smoothed in  polishing with Putty. If the Glass be only well polished and free from  Veins, and the Sides not accurately plane, but a little Convex or  Concave, as it frequently happens; yet may the three Spectrums Y, PT and  _pt_ want Penumbras, but not in equal distances from the Prisms. Now  from this want of Penumbras, I knew more certainly that every one of the  Circles was refracted according to some most regular, uniform and  constant Law. For if there were any irregularity in the Refraction, the  right Lines AE and GL, which all the Circles in the Spectrum PT do  touch, could not by that Refraction be translated into the Lines _ae_  and _gl_ as distinct and straight as they were before, but there would  arise in those translated Lines some Penumbra or Crookedness or  Undulation, or other sensible Perturbation contrary to what is found by  Experience. Whatsoever Penumbra or Perturbation should be made in the  Circles by the cross Refraction of the second Prism, all that Penumbra  or Perturbation would be conspicuous in the right Lines _ae_ and _gl_  which touch those Circles. And therefore since there is no such Penumbra  or Perturbation in those right Lines, there must be none in the  Circles. Since the distance between those Tangents or breadth of the  Spectrum is not increased by the Refractions, the Diameters of the  Circles are not increased thereby. Since those Tangents continue to be  right Lines, every Circle which in the first Prism is more or less  refracted, is exactly in the same proportion more or less refracted in  the second. And seeing all these things continue to succeed after the  same manner when the Rays are again in a third Prism, and again in a  fourth refracted sideways, it is evident that the Rays of one and the  same Circle, as to their degree of Refrangibility, continue always  uniform and homogeneal to one another, and that those of several Circles  do differ in degree of Refrangibility, and that in some certain and  constant Proportion. Which is the thing I was to prove.    There is yet another Circumstance or two of this Experiment by which it  becomes still more plain and convincing. Let the second Prism DH [in  _Fig._ 16.] be placed not immediately after the first, but at some  distance from it; suppose in the mid-way between it and the Wall on  which the oblong Spectrum PT is cast, so that the Light from the first  Prism may fall upon it in the form of an oblong Spectrum [Greek: pt]  parallel to this second Prism, and be refracted sideways to form the  oblong Spectrum _pt_ upon the Wall. And you will find as before, that  this Spectrum _pt_ is inclined to that Spectrum PT, which the first  Prism forms alone without the second; the blue ends P and _p_ being  farther distant from one another than the red ones T and _t_, and by  consequence that the Rays which go to the blue end [Greek: p] of the  Image [Greek: pt], and which therefore suffer the greatest Refraction in  the first Prism, are again in the second Prism more refracted than the  rest.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    The same thing I try'd also by letting the Sun's Light into a dark Room  through two little round holes F and [Greek: ph] [in _Fig._ 17.] made in  the Window, and with two parallel Prisms ABC and [Greek: abg] placed at  those holes (one at each) refracting those two beams of Light to the  opposite Wall of the Chamber, in such manner that the two colour'd  Images PT and MN which they there painted were joined end to end and lay  in one straight Line, the red end T of the one touching the blue end M  of the other. For if these two refracted Beams were again by a third  Prism DH placed cross to the two first, refracted sideways, and the  Spectrums thereby translated to some other part of the Wall of the  Chamber, suppose the Spectrum PT to _pt_ and the Spectrum MN to _mn_,  these translated Spectrums _pt_ and _mn_ would not lie in one straight  Line with their ends contiguous as before, but be broken off from one  another and become parallel, the blue end _m_ of the Image _mn_ being by  a greater Refraction translated farther from its former place MT, than  the red end _t_ of the other Image _pt_ from the same place MT; which  puts the Proposition past Dispute. And this happens whether the third  Prism DH be placed immediately after the two first, or at a great  distance from them, so that the Light refracted in the two first Prisms  be either white and circular, or coloured and oblong when it falls on  the third.    _Exper._ 6. In the middle of two thin Boards I made round holes a third  part of an Inch in diameter, and in the Window-shut a much broader hole  being made to let into my darkned Chamber a large Beam of the Sun's  Light; I placed a Prism behind the Shut in that beam to refract it  towards the opposite Wall, and close behind the Prism I fixed one of the  Boards, in such manner that the middle of the refracted Light might pass  through the hole made in it, and the rest be intercepted by the Board.  Then at the distance of about twelve Feet from the first Board I fixed  the other Board in such manner that the middle of the refracted Light  which came through the hole in the first Board, and fell upon the  opposite Wall, might pass through the hole in this other Board, and the  rest being intercepted by the Board might paint upon it the coloured  Spectrum of the Sun. And close behind this Board I fixed another Prism  to refract the Light which came through the hole. Then I returned  speedily to the first Prism, and by turning it slowly to and fro about  its Axis, I caused the Image which fell upon the second Board to move up  and down upon that Board, that all its parts might successively pass  through the hole in that Board and fall upon the Prism behind it. And in  the mean time, I noted the places on the opposite Wall to which that  Light after its Refraction in the second Prism did pass; and by the  difference of the places I found that the Light which being most  refracted in the first Prism did go to the blue end of the Image, was  again more refracted in the second Prism than the Light which went to  the red end of that Image, which proves as well the first Proposition as  the second. And this happened whether the Axis of the two Prisms were  parallel, or inclined to one another, and to the Horizon in any given  Angles.    _Illustration._ Let F [in _Fig._ 18.] be the wide hole in the  Window-shut, through which the Sun shines upon the first Prism ABC, and  let the refracted Light fall upon the middle of the Board DE, and the  middle part of that Light upon the hole G made in the middle part of  that Board. Let this trajected part of that Light fall again upon the  middle of the second Board _de_, and there paint such an oblong coloured  Image of the Sun as was described in the third Experiment. By turning  the Prism ABC slowly to and fro about its Axis, this Image will be made  to move up and down the Board _de_, and by this means all its parts from  one end to the other may be made to pass successively through the hole  _g_ which is made in the middle of that Board. In the mean while another  Prism _abc_ is to be fixed next after that hole _g_, to refract the  trajected Light a second time. And these things being thus ordered, I  marked the places M and N of the opposite Wall upon which the refracted  Light"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#6)"],[1," dive.

Body dark gray with irregular white area on belly; flippers      white; underside of flukes often has varying amounts of white.    Head in front of blowhole flat and covered with knobs.    Baleen dark gray to black with olive-black bristles.    Dorsal fin small, quite variable in shape, usually hooked,      located on a step or hump, in last one-third of back.    Flippers very long (to nearly one-third of body length), white,      and scalloped on leading edge.    Distribution at least New England to Iceland and Greenland during      summer.    Distribution to shallow tropical banks, winter and spring.    Flukes often scalloped on trailing edges and sometimes raised on      dive.    NOTE: Because of its small adult size, usually less than 30 feet (9.1 m),  another member of the rorqual family, the minke whale, is included with  the medium-sized whales in this guide. Features by which it may be  distinguished from all other rorquals are discussed in the species  account.    Further, inasmuch as the dorsal fin of the humpback whale is highly  variable in shape, positive identification may require reference to the  sperm whale (p. 57), which, though the sperm whale has been classified  with species without dorsal fin, has a rather distinct dorsal hump,  particularly noticeable when the animal arches the back and tail to  begin a long dive.    [Illustration: Figure 8a.--Swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics  of blue, fin, sei, and Bryde's whales.]    [Illustration: Figure 8b.--Swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics  of humpback, bowhead, right, and sperm whales.]      (40-65 feet [12-20 m] maximum overall length)      Without a Dorsal Fin    There are three species of large whales without a dorsal fin in the  western North Atlantic Ocean. Two of these, the bowhead or Greenland  whale, and its more widely distributed close relative the right whale,  are baleen whales. The third, the sperm whale, is a toothed whale. The  first two have relatively smooth backs without even a trace of a dorsal  fin. The sperm whale has a humplike low, thick, dorsal ridge, which,  from certain views, particularly when the animal is humping up to begin  a dive, may be clearly visible and look like a fin. But because the  profile of that hump and the knuckles which follow it are often not very  prominent in this species, it has been classified with the finless big  whales.    All three species are characterized by very distinctive blows or spouts.  In both the bowhead and the right whales, the projection of the blow  upward from two widely separated blowholes assumes a very wide V-shape  with two distinct columns, which may be seen when the animals are viewed  from front or back. Though this character may be visible under ideal  conditions in many of the other baleen whales species as well, it is  exaggerated and uniformly distinct in the bowhead and right whales and  may be used as one of the primary key characters. In the sperm whale,  the blow emanates from a blowhole which is displaced to the left of the  head near the front and projects obliquely forward to the animal's left.  This blow seen under ideal conditions positively labels a large whale as  a sperm whale.    Remember, however, that wind conditions may affect the disposition and  duration of the blow of any species and that a single character alone is  seldom sufficient to permit positive identification.

MEDIUM-SIZED WHALES    (13-32 feet [4-10 m] maximum overall length)      With a Dorsal Fin    There are 11 species of medium-sized whales with a dorsal fin known from  the western North Atlantic. These species, taking many diverse forms,  range in maximum adult size from about 13 feet (4.0 m) (grampus) to  about 33 feet (10.1 m) (the minke whale). This group includes such  widely distributed and frequently encountered species as the pilot  whales, false killer whales, and minke whales, and such rarely  encountered and poorly known species as the various \"beaked whales\"  (_Mesoplodon_ spp. and the goosebeaked whale).    Aside from their common inclusion within the stated size range and the  presence of a dorsal fin in all species (which ranges from only a small  nubbin in some of the beaked whales to a substantial 5- to 6-foot [1.5-  to 1.8-m] sail on adult male killer whales), these species have no  diagnostic field characteristics in common. Therefore, each is discussed  in detail and is placed in the text in near proximity to those species  with which it is likely to be confused in the field.
