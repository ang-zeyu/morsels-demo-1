They will repay us with their sweetest songs.    [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff. BALTIMORE ORIOLE.]          THE SNOWY OWL.      Few of all the groups of birds have such decided markings, such  characteristic distinctions, as the Owl. There is a singular  resemblance between the face of an Owl and that of a cat, which is the  more notable, as both of these creatures have much the same habits,  live on the same prey, and are evidently representatives of the same  idea in their different classes. The Owl, in fact, is a winged cat,  just as the cat is a furred owl.    The Snowy Owl is one of the handsomest of this group, not so much on  account of its size, which is considerable, as by reason of the  beautiful white mantle which it wears, and the large orange eyeballs  that shine with the lustre of a topaz set among the snowy plumage.    It is a native of the north of Europe and America, but is also found  in the more northern parts of England, being seen, though rather a  scarce bird, in the Shetland and Orkney Islands, where it builds its  nest and rears its young. One will be more likely to find this owl  near the shore, along the line of salt marshes and woody stubble, than  further inland. The marshes do not freeze so easily or deep as the  iron bound uplands, and field-mice are more plentiful in them. It is  so fleet of wing that if its appetite is whetted, it can follow and  capture a Snow Bunting or a Junco in its most rapid flight.    Like the Hawk Owl, it is a day-flying bird, and is a terrible foe  to the smaller mammalia, and to various birds. Mr. Yarrell in his  \"History of the British Birds,\" states that one wounded on the Isle of  Balta disgorged a young rabbit whole, and that a young Sandpiper, with  its plumage entire, was found in the stomach of another.    In proportion to its size the Snowy Owl is a mighty hunter, having  been detected chasing the American hare, and carrying off wounded  Grouse before the sportsman could secure his prey. It is also a good  fisherman, posting itself on some convenient spot overhanging the  water, and securing its finny prey with a lightning-like grasp of the  claw as it passes beneath the white clad fisher. Sometimes it will  sail over the surface of a stream, and snatch the fish as they rise  for food. It is also a great lover of lemmings, and in the destruction  of these quadruped pests does infinite service to the agriculturist.    The large round eyes of this owl are very beautiful. Even by daylight  they are remarkable for their gem-like sheen, but in the evening they  are even more attractive, glowing like balls of living fire.    From sheer fatigue these birds often seek a temporary resting place on  passing ships. A solitary owl, after a long journey, settled on the  rigging of a ship one night. A sailor who was ordered aloft, terrified  by the two glowing eyes that suddenly opened upon his own, descended  hurriedly to the deck, declaring to the crew that he had seen \"Davy  Jones a-sitting up there on the main yard.\"          THE SNOWY OWL.      What do you think of this bird with his round, puffy head? You of  course know it is an Owl. I want you to know him as the Snowy Owl.    Don't you think his face is some like that of your cat? This fellow is  not full grown, but only a child. If he were full grown he would be  pure white. The dark color you see is only the tips of the feathers.  You can't see his beak very well for the soft feathers almost cover  it.    His large soft eyes look very pretty out of the white feathers. What  color would you call them? Most owls are quiet during the day and very  busy all night. The Snowy Owl is not so quiet day times. He flies  about considerably and gets most of his food in daylight.    A hunter who was resting under a tree, on the bank of a river, tells  this of him:    \"A Snowy Owl was perched on the branch of a dead tree that had fallen  into the river. He sat there looking into the water and blinking his  large eyes.    Suddenly he reached out and before I could see how he did it, a fish  was in his claws.\"    This certainly shows that he can see well in the day time. He can see  best, however, in the twilight, in cloudy weather or moonlight. That  is the way with your cat.    The wing feathers of the owl are different from those of most birds.  They are as soft as down. This is why you cannot hear him when he  flies. Owls while perching are almost always found in quiet places  where they will not be disturbed.    Did you ever hear the voice of an owl in the night? If you never have,  you cannot imagine how dreary it sounds. He surely is \"The Bird of the  Night.\"    [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences. SNOWY OWL.]          BIRDS AND FARMERS.    _From the Forest and Stream._      The advocates of protection for our small birds present two sets of  reasons for preventing their killing; the one sentimental, and the  other economic.    The sentimental reasons are the ones most often urged; they are also  of a kind to appeal with especial force to those whose responsibility  for the destruction of the birds is greatest. The women and girls, for  whose adornment birds' plumage is chiefly used, think little and know  less about the services which birds perform for agriculture, and  indeed it may be doubted whether the sight of a bunch of feathers or a  stuffed bird's skin suggests to them any thought of the life that  those feathers once represented. But when the wearers are reminded  that there was such a life; that it was cheery and beautiful, and that  it was cut short merely that their apparel might be adorned, they are  quick to recognize that bird destruction involves a wrong, and are  ready to do their part toward ending it by refusing to wear plumage.    The small boy who pursues little birds from the standpoint of the  hunter in quest of his game, feels only the ardor of pursuit. His  whole mind is concentrated on that and the hunter's selfishness, the  desire of possession, fills his heart. Ignorance and thoughtlessness  destroy the birds.    Every one knows in a general way that birds render most valuable  service to the farmer, but although these services have long been  recognized in the laws standing on the statute books of the  various states, it is only within a few years that any systematic  investigations have been undertaken to determine just what such  services are, to measure them with some approach to accuracy, to weigh  in the case of each species the good and the evil done, and so to  strike a balance in favor of the bird or against it. The inquiries  carried on by the Agricultural Department on a large scale and those  made by various local experiment stations and by individual observers  have given results which are very striking and which can no longer be  ignored.    It is a difficult matter for any one to balance the good things that  he reads and believes about any animal against the bad things that he  actually sees. The man who witnesses the theft of his cherries by  robin or catbird, or the killing of a quail by a marsh hawk, feels  that here he has ocular proof of harm done by the birds, while as to  the insects or the field mice destroyed, and the crops saved, he has  only the testimony of some unknown and distant witness. It is only  natural that the observer should trust the evidence of his senses, and  yet his eyes tell him only a small part of the truth, and that small  part a misleading one.    It is certain that without the services of these feathered laborers,  whose work is unseen, though it lasts from daylight till dark through  every day in the year, agriculture in this country would come to an  immediate standstill, and if in the brief season of fruit each one  of these workers levies on the farmer the tribute of a few berries,  the price is surely a small one to pay for the great good done.  Superficial persons imagine that the birds are here only during the  summer, but this is a great mistake. It is true that in warm weather,  when insect life is most abundant, birds are also most abundant. They  wage an effective and unceasing war against the adult insects and  their larvae, and check their active depredations; but in winter the  birds carry on a campaign which is hardly less important in its  results.          THE SCARLET TANAGER.      One of the most brilliant and striking of all American birds is  the Scarlet Tanager. From its black wings resembling pockets, it  is frequently called the \"Pocket Bird.\" The French call it the  \"Cardinal.\" The female is plain olive-green, and when seen together  the pair present a curious example of the prodigality with which  mother nature pours out her favors of beauty in the adornment of some  of her creatures and seems niggardly in her treatment of others. Still  it is only by contrast that we are enabled to appreciate the quality  of beauty, which in this case is of the rarest sort. In the January  number of BIRDS we presented the Red Rumped Tanager, a Costa Rica  bird, which, however, is inferior in brilliancy to the Scarlet, whose  range extends from eastern United States, north to southern Canada,  west to the great plains, and south in winter to northern South  America. It inhabits woodlands and swampy places. The nesting season  begins in the latter part of May, the nest being built in low thick  woods or on the skirting of tangled thickets; very often also, in an  orchard, on the horizontal limb of a low tree or sapling. It is very  flat and loosely made of twigs and fine bark strips and lined with  rootlets and fibers of inner bark.    The eggs are from three to five in number, and of a greenish blue,  speckled and blotted with brown, chiefly at the larger end.    The disposition of the Scarlet Tanager is retiring, in which respect  he differs greatly from the Summer Tanager, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],[0,"The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#6)"],[1,"his teeth and give it a bit of a nip. Sometimes he would  even pull Spot's tail.    Of course nobody can sleep under such interruptions. Spot learned that  when he wanted to rest he had to hide in some place where the puppy  couldn't follow him. And as the puppy became bigger Spot found it harder  to slip away from him. The youngster would trail Spot into the barn and  even as far as the hay-stack in the meadow.    Once the old dog had _wished_ for a puppy. Now, however, he could  scarcely wait for this lively youngster to grow into a dog.    A whole year passed before Spot had any peace again. And when another  summer had come, and Johnnie Green went visiting again, Spot muttered  with a deep groan:    \"I hope Johnnie will have sense enough not to bring another puppy with  him when he comes home.\"          XVI    MRS. WOODCHUCK RUNS      Mrs. Woodchuck was on her way home, waddling across the pasture. She had  been making a call on Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the herb doctor, who lived  under the hill. They had talked over all the news in the neighborhood.  And Mrs. Woodchuck had her mind on some gossip that Aunt Polly had told  her. Otherwise she might have noticed sooner that old dog Spot had spied  her.    If he hadn't spoken he would certainly have caught her that time. For  Mrs. Woodchuck was fat and couldn't run as fast as she used to. But when  Spot's keen nose caught a scent that told him there was one of the  Woodchuck family not far away he just had to give one long-drawn howl.    When Mrs. Woodchuck heard that dreadful sound she scurried for home. She  dropped her knitting and the apple that Aunt Polly had given her. And  she only managed to pop down the hole that was her front door with Spot  scarcely a length behind her.    \"Just missed her!\" the old dog yelped. \"How unlucky!\"    \"Just escaped!\" Mrs. Woodchuck gasped. \"How fortunate!\"    She knew that she was safe. So she took her own time in crawling through  the long hall that led to her one-room dwelling.    \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed as she entered her underground home and saw  that it was empty. \"Mr. Woodchuck and Billy are away. I must hurry and  warn them that old dog Spot is prowling about the pasture.\"    Meanwhile Spot lingered at Mrs. Woodchuck's front door. He scratched in  the dirt that was thrown up before it. He sniffed at the tracks that the  Woodchuck family had made all about.    \"I know now where that fat Mrs. Woodchuck lives,\" he growled. \"I'll keep  an eye on this hole. Some day I may be able to get between her and her  home. And then--\"    He did not finish what he was saying, but licked his lips as if he had  just enjoyed a hearty meal.    For a long time Spot waited there. He could hardly have expected Mrs.  Woodchuck to come out and invite him to enter her house. The most that  she was likely to do would be to creep not quite to the upper end of  her front hall and peer out to see what she could through the small  round opening.    \"That dame must have a family,\" Spot thought. \"I'd like to meet  them--whether there's one youngster or seven. The more the merrier for  me.\"    If Spot had happened to look around just then he would have had his wish  granted. Or if the wind had been blowing the other way he could have  told, without looking around, that Mrs. Woodchuck's son Billy was gazing  at him, with popeyes, from behind a near-by hummock. He had meandered  homewards, pausing here and there to nip off a clover head or tear at a  plantain leaf, little dreaming that old dog Spot was right in his  door-yard.    When he caught sight of the unwelcome caller Billy sat up and took one  good, long look at him.    Then Mrs Woodchuck's son turned and ran down the hillside as fast as his  short legs would carry him. He didn't stop until he had reached the  fence between the pasture and the meadow. Dashing in among the brakes  that grew deep along the fence he cowered under the cover that they gave  him.    All at once he felt quite ashamed of himself.    \"I almost forgot the rule!\" he chattered. \"The rule says, 'When there's  a Dog about, warn everybody!'\"          XVII    THE DANGER SIGNAL      Billy Woodchuck remembered, after he had fled from old dog Spot, that he  ought to warn his family and his friends. So he sat up, stuck his head  out of the tangle of brakes where he had hidden, and gave the danger  signal, a sharp whistle.    \"Dear me!\" he said. \"I fear Father and Mother won't hear that. And if  they go home they'll run upon old dog Spot. And then there's no knowing  what might happen.\"    He knew that his mother had gone to see Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who lived  under the hill. And he knew that his father, with a few cronies, was  enjoying a feast in Farmer Green's clover patch.    \"I'll hurry over to Aunt Polly's first,\" he decided, \"and tell Mother to  beware the Dog.\"    So Billy Woodchuck scampered off toward the hill where Aunt Polly  Woodchuck made her home. When he knocked at Aunt Polly's door and  learned that Mrs. Woodchuck had left some time before Billy was much  upset.    \"Perhaps she went to the clover patch,\" Aunt Polly suggested. \"You know  your father sometimes forgets to go home unless somebody goes for him.\"    Well, Billy started off again. And he hadn't gone far when he heard a  sound that made him sit up and listen. Like all his family, he had very  sharp ears. And now, after cocking his head on one side for a few  moments, he knew that what he heard was old dog Spot grumbling and  growling.    \"My goodness!\" Billy Woodchuck gasped. \"He's left our house. And if I  don't look out he'll catch me.\"    At almost the same instant old Spot paused and sniffed the air.    \"Ha!\" he cried. \"I smell a Woodchuck. And if I'm not mistaken it's a  different Woodchuck from the one I chased a little while ago.\"    Billy Woodchuck and Spot began to run at the same time. Billy headed for  home; and Spot headed for him.    Again old dog Spot was just a bit too late. Billy Woodchuck darted into  the hole in the hillside not a second too soon. He could hear Spot  panting close behind him.    \"Such luck!\" Spot growled. \"There's another that's got away from me.  There's the second one that I've run into that hole. I suppose they're  chuckling inside their house and making all manner of fun of me.\"    The old dog was mistaken. Billy Woodchuck was not chuckling. He found  nobody at home. It was plain that his parents were still abroad.    \"They may be coming from the clover patch now,\" he groaned. And if  they are, they're sure to stumble upon that terrible creature at the  door. I must warn them before it's too late.\"    While Spot was still snorting and snuffling around the Woodchuck  family's front door, Billy Woodchuck crept out of the back door and  started for the clover patch. Little did he know that his mother had  already stolen out the same way, to warn him and his father.    When unwelcome callers come, a back door is sometimes a convenient  thing to have about a house.          XVIII    A CROWDED HOUSE      Old dog Spot never once guessed that there was a back door to the  Woodchuck family's home in the pasture. He had chased Mrs. Woodchuck  into her house. He had likewise hunted her son Billy into the same front  door through which his mother had scrambled only a short time before.    \"There must be more of these fat folks about the pasture,\" Spot thought.  \"I'll range around a bit and see if I can't surprise another.\"    So he began running about the pasture in big circles. And he was lucky  enough, before long, to come upon Mr. Woodchuck himself, who had dined  so heartily on clover heads that he had decided to go to his chamber and  take a nap.    Spot was unlucky enough to lose him. Mr. Woodchuck had been feeling  quite sleepy. But when he suddenly found himself pursued by a dog he was  wide awake in an instant and running like a youngster.    He reached his home just in time.    \"Well, that makes the third one that's inside the house,\" Spot muttered,  shortly afterward, as he paused to get his breath.    Little did he know how mistaken he was. There wasn't even one of the  Woodchuck family at home; for Mr. Woodchuck had at once hurried out the  back way, because he wanted to find his wife and his son and tell them  to keep away from old dog Spot.    Soon Spot took a few more turns around the pasture. And this time he ran  across Mrs. Woodchuck again.    He had no sooner run her to earth once more than he found Billy for the  second time.    \"This is a twin brother of the fellow I chased home once before,\" Spot  panted, little dreaming that Billy Woodchuck had come back into the  daylight.    \"This twin is just as spry as the other one was,\" Spot gasped as he  reached for Billy right at his door--and missed him.    After that the old dog chased Mr. Woodchuck, then his wife, and next  their son Billy Woodchuck. And he didn't succeed in catching any one of  the three. Each of them beat him in the race to the Woodchuck family's  front door.    Old Spot began to feel quite upset.    \"I don't see what the matter with me to-day,\" he puzzled. \"I hope I'm  not getting so old that I'm _weeble_.\" (By that he meant _weak_ and  _feeble_.)    \"This last one makes eight that I've followed all the way to this door,\"  Spot growled. \"There can't be many more left in the pasture. I'm going  to lie down behind this hummock and wait till they come out.\"    So he hid a little way off and watched closely.    He had been there a long time when Mr. Crow at last flew low over the  pasture and alighted in a tree near-by.    \"What are you waiting for?\" he asked Spot.    \"Woodchucks!\" said Spot. \"This burrow is full of them.\"    \"Are you sure?\" Mr. Crow inquired.    \"I chased eight of them home,\" Spot explained.    \"That's odd,\" said Mr. Crow. \"There have been only three living here  lately. And they don't live here any more.\"    \"They don't!\" Spot cried.    \"No!\" Mr. Crow told him. \"They moved this afternoon.\"    Old dog Spot sprang to"]]]
