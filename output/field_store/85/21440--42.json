But if Des  Maizeaux lost his honour in this transaction, he was at heart an honest  man, who had swerved for a single moment; his conscience was soon  awakened, and he experienced the most violent compunctions. It was in a  paroxysm of this nature that he addressed the following letter to a  mutual friend of the late Anthony Collins and himself.         SIR,                                       _January 6, 1730._       I am very glad to hear you are come to town, and as you are my best     friend, now I have lost Mr. Collins, give me leave to open my heart     to you, and to beg your assistance in an affair which highly concerns     both Mr. Collins's (your friend) and my own honour and reputation.     The case, in few words, stands thus:--Mr. Collins by his last will     and testament left me his manuscripts. Mr. Tomlinson, who first     acquainted me with it, told me that Mrs. Collins should be glad to     have them, and I made them over to her; whereupon she was pleased to     present me with fifty guineas. I desired her at the same time to take     care they should be kept safe and unhurt, which she promised to do.     This was done the 25th of last month. Mr. Tomlinson, who managed all     this affair, was present.       Now, having further considered that matter, I find that I have done a     most wicked thing. I am persuaded that I have betrayed the trust of a     person who, for twenty-six years, had given me continual instances of     his friendship and confidence. I am convinced that I have acted     contrary to the will and intention of my dear deceased friend; showed     a disregard to the particular mark of esteem he gave me on that     occasion; in short, that I have forfeited what is dearer to me than     my own life--honour and reputation.       These melancholy thoughts have made so great an impression upon me,     that I protest to you I can enjoy no rest; they haunt me everywhere,     day and night. I earnestly beseech you, sir, to represent my unhappy     case to Mrs. Collins. I acted with all the simplicity and uprightness     of my heart; I considered that the MSS. would be as safe in Mrs.     Collins's hands as in mine; that she was no less obliged to preserve     them than myself; and that, as the library was left to her, they     might naturally go along with it. Besides, I thought I could not too     much comply with the desire of a lady to whom I have so many     obligations. But I see now clearly that this is not fulfilling Mr.     Collins's will, and that the duties of our conscience are superior to     all other regards. But it is in her power to forgive and mend what I     have done imprudently, but with a good intention. Her high sense of     virtue and generosity will not, I am sure, let her take any advantage     of my weakness; and the tender regard she has for the memory of the     best of men, and the tenderest of husbands, will not suffer that his     intentions should be frustrated, and that she should be the     instrument of violating what is most sacred. If our late friend had     designed that his MSS. should remain in her hands, he would certainly     have left them to her by his last will and testament; his acting     otherwise is an evident proof that it was not his intention.       All this I proposed to represent to her in the most respectful     manner; but you will do it infinitely better than I can in this     present distraction of mind; and I flatter myself that the mutual     esteem and friendship which has continued so many years between Mr.     Collins and you, will make you readily embrace whatever tends to     honour his memory.       I send you the fifty guineas I received, which I do now look upon as     the wages of iniquity; and I desire you to return them to Mrs.     Collins, who, as I hope it of her justice, equity, and regard to Mr.     Collins's intentions, will be pleased to cancel my paper.         I am, &c.,           P. DES MAIZEAUX.    The manuscripts were never returned to Des Maizeaux; for seven years  afterwards Mrs. Collins, who appears to have been a very spirited lady,  addressed to him the following letter on the subject of a report, that  she had permitted transcripts of these very manuscripts to get abroad.  This occasioned an animated correspondence from both sides.         SIR,                                       _March 10, 1736-37_.       I have thus long waited in expectation that you would ere this have     called on Dean Sykes, as Sir B. Lucy said you intended, that I might     have had some satisfaction in relation to a very unjust     reproach--viz., that I, or somebody that I had trusted, had     _betrayed_ some of the transcripts, or MSS., of Mr. Collins into the     Bishop of London's hands. I cannot, therefore, since you have not     been with the dean as was desired, but call on you in this manner, to     know what authority you had for such a reflection; or on what grounds     you went for saying that these transcripts are in the Bishop of     London's hands. I am determined to trace out the grounds of such a     report; and you can be no friend of mine, no friend of Mr. Collins,     no friend to common justice, if you refuse to acquaint me, what     foundation you had for such a charge. I desire a very speedy answer     to this, who am, Sir,         Your servant,           ELIZ. COLLINS.       _To Mr. Des Maizeaux, at his lodgings next door to the Quakers'     burying-ground, Hanover-street, out of Long-Acre._         TO MRS. COLLINS.                                                  _March 14, 1737._       I had the honour of your letter of the 10th inst., and as I find that     something has been misapprehended, I beg leave to set this matter     right.       Being lately with some honourable persons, I told them it had been     reported that some of Mr. C.'s MSS. were fallen into the hands of     strangers, and that I should be glad to receive from you such     information as might enable me to disprove that report. What     occasioned this surmise, or what particular MSS. were meant, I was     not able to discover; so I was left to my own conjectures, which,     upon a serious consideration, induced me to believe that it might     relate to the MSS. in eight volumes in 8vo, of which there is a     transcript. But as the original and the transcript are in your     possession, if you please, madam, to compare them together, you may     easily see whether they be both entire and perfect, or whether there     be anything wanting in either of them. By this means you will assure     yourself, and satisfy your friends, that several important pieces are     safe in your hands, and that the report is false and groundless. All     this I take the liberty to offer out of the singular respect I always     professed for you, and for the memory of Mr. Collins, to whom I have     endeavoured to do justice on all occasions, and particularly in the     memoirs that have been made use of in the General Dictionary; and I     hope my tender concern for his reputation will further appear when I     publish his life.         SIR,                                       _April 6, 1737_.       My ill state of health has hindered me from acknowledging sooner the     receipt of yours, from which I hoped for some satisfaction in     relation to your charge, in which I cannot but think myself very     deeply concerned. You tell me now, that you was left to your own     conjectures what particular MSS. were reported to have fallen into     the hands of strangers, and that upon a serious consideration you was     induced to believe that it might relate to the MSS. in eight vols.     8vo, of which there was a transcript.       I must beg of you to satisfy me very explicitly who were the persons     that reported this to you, and from whom did you receive this     information? You know that Mr. Collins left several MSS. behind him;     what grounds had you for your conjecture that it related to the MSS.     in eight vols., rather than to any other MSS. of which there was a     transcript? I beg that you will be very plain, and tell me what     strangers were named to you; and why you said the Bishop of London,     if your informer said stranger to you. I am so much concerned in     this, that I must repeat it, if you have the singular respect for Mr.     Collins which you profess, that you would help me to trace out this     reproach, which is so abusive to, Sir,         Your servant,            ELIZ. COLLINS.         TO MRS. COLLINS.       I flattered myself that my last letter would have satisfied you, but     I have the mortification to see that my hopes were vain. Therefore I     beg leave once more to set this matter right. When I told you what     had been reported, I acted, as I thought, the part of a true friend,     by acquainting you that some of your MSS. had been purloined, in     order that you might examine a fact which to me appeared of the last     consequence; and I verily believe that everybody in my case would     have expected thanks for such a friendly information. But instead of     that I find myself represented as an enemy, and challenged to produce     proofs and witnesses of a thing dropt in conversation, a hearsay, as     if in those cases people kept a register of what they hear, and     entered the names of the persons who spoke, the time, place, &c., and     had with them persons ready to witness the whole, &c. I did own I     never thought of such a thing, and whenever I happened to hear that     some of my friends had some loss, I thought it my duty to acquaint     them with such report, that they might inquire into the matter, and     see whether there was any ground for it. But I never troubled myself     with the names of the persons who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#6)"],[1,"to step in. Now! art thou going?\" and then he nodded to  the shadow, and the shadow nodded again. \"Well then, go! but don't  stay away.\"    The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony  rose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round.  Yes! if any one had paid particular attention to it, they would have  seen, quite distinctly, that the shadow went in through the half-open  balcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went  into his own room, and let the long curtain fall down after him.    Next morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the  newspapers.    \"What is that?\" said he, as he came out into the sunshine. \"I have no  shadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come again.  It is really tiresome!\"    This annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because  he knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known  to everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now  came there and told his story, they would say that he was imitating  it, and that he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk about  it at all; and that was wisely thought.    ------    * Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man.    ------    In the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the  light directly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always  have its master for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made  himself little; he made himself great: but no shadow came again. He  said, \"Hem! hem!\" but it was of no use.    It was vexatious; but in the warm lands every thing grows so quickly;  and after the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that  a new shadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had  a very fair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the  northern lands, grew more and more in the journey, so that at last it  was so long and so large, that it was more than sufficient.    The learned man then came home, and he wrote books about what was true  in the world, and about what was good and what was beautiful; and  there passed days and years,--yes! many years passed away.    One evening, as he was sitting in his room, there was a gentle  knocking at the door.    \"Come in!\" said he; but no one came in; so he opened the door, and  there stood before him such an extremely lean man, that he felt quite  strange. As to the rest, the man was very finely dressed,--he must be  a gentleman.    \"Whom have I the honor of speaking to?\" asked the learned man.    \"Yes! I thought as much,\" said the fine man. \"I thought you would not  know me. I have got so much body. I have even got flesh and clothes.  You certainly never thought of seeing me so well off. Do you not know  your old shadow? You certainly thought I should never more return.  Things have gone on well with me since I was last with you. I have, in  all respects, become very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from  service? If so, I can do it;\" and then he rattled a whole bunch of  valuable seals that hung to his watch, and he stuck his hand in the  thick gold chain he wore around his neck;--nay! how all his fingers  glittered with diamond rings; and then all were pure gems.    \"Nay; I cannot recover from my surprise!\" said the learned man: \"what  is the meaning of all this?\"    \"Something common, is it not,\" said the shadow: \"but you yourself do  not belong to the common order; and I, as you know well, have from a  child followed in your footsteps, As soon as you found I was capable  to go out alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most  brilliant circumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to  see you once more before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also  wished to see this land again,--for you know we always love our native  land. I know you have got another shadow again; have I anything to pay  to it or you? If so, you will oblige me by saying what it is.\"    \"Nay, is it really thou?\" said the learned man: \"it is most  remarkable: I never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as  a man.\"    \"Tell me what I have to pay,\" said the shadow; \"for I don't like to be  in any sort of debt.\"    \"How canst thou talk so?\" said the learned man; \"what debt is there to  talk about? Make thyself as free as any one else. I am extremely glad  to hear of thy good fortune: sit down, old friend, and tell me a  little how it has gone with thee, and what thou hast seen at our  opposite neighbor's there--in the warm lands.\"    \"Yes, I will tell you all about it,\" said the shadow, and sat down:  \"but then you must also promise me, that, wherever you may meet me,  you will never say to any one here in the town that I have been your  shadow. I intend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one  family.\"    \"Be quite at thy ease about that,\" said the learned man; \"I shall not  say to any one who thou actually art: here is my hand--I promise it,  and a man's bond is his word.\"    \"A word is a shadow,\" said the shadow, \"and as such it must speak.\"    It was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was  dressed entirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent  leather boots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was  bare crown and brim; not to speak of what we already know it  had--seals, gold neck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was  well-dressed, and it was just that which made it quite a man.    \"Now I shall tell you my adventures,\" said the shadow; and then he  sat, with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of  the learned man's new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet.  Now this was perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the ground kept  itself so still and quiet, that it might hear all that passed: it  wished to know how it could get free, and work its way up, so as to  become its own master.    \"Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?\" said the  shadow; \"it was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy! I was  there for three weeks, and that has as much effect as if one had lived  three thousand years, and read all that was composed and written; that  is what I say, and it is right. I have seen everything and I know  everything!\"    \"Poesy!\" cried the learned man; \"yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse  in large cities! Poesy! yes, I have seen her,--a single short moment,  but sleep came into my eyes! She stood on the balcony and shone as the  aurora borealis shines. Go on, go on!--thou wert on the balcony, and  went through the doorway, and then------\"    \"Then I was in the antechamber,\" said the shadow. \"You always sat and  looked over to the antechamber. There was no light; there was a sort  of twilight, but the one door stood open directly opposite the other  through a long row of rooms and saloons, and there it was lighted up.  I should have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden;  but I was circumspect, I took time to think, and that one must always  do.\"    \"And what didst thou then see?\" asked the learned man.    \"I saw everything, and I shall tell all to you: but,--it is no pride  on my part,--as a free man, and with the knowledge I have, not to  speak of my position in life, my excellent circumstances,--I certainly  wish that you would say _you_* to me!\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said the learned man; \"it is an old habit with  me. _You_ are perfectly right, and I shall remember it; but now _you_  must tell me all _you_ saw!\"    \"Everything!\" said the shadow, \"for I saw everything, and I know  everything!\"    \"How did it look in the furthest saloon?\" asked the learned man. \"Was  it there as in the fresh woods? Was it there as in a holy church? Were  the saloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high  mountains?\"    ------    * It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the  second person singular, \"Du,\" (thou) when speaking to each other. When  a friendship is formed between men, they generally affirm it, when  occasion offers, either in public or private, by drinking to each  other and exclaiming, \"_thy health_,\" at the same time striking their  glasses together.--This is called drinking \"_Duus_:\"--they are then,  \"_Duus Brodre_,\" (thou brothers,) and ever afterwards use the pronoun  \"_thou_,\" to each other, it being regarded as more familiar than \"De,\"  (you). Father and mother, sister and brother, say _thou_ to one  another--without regard to age or rank. Master and mistress say _thou_  to their servants--the superior to the inferior. But servants and  inferiors do not use the same term to their masters, or superiors--nor  is it ever used when speaking to a stranger, or any one with whom they  are but slightly acquainted--they then say as in English--_you._    ------    \"Everything was there!\" said the shadow. \"I did not go quite in, I  remained in the foremost room, in the twilight, but I stood there  quite well; I saw everything, and I know everything! I have been in  the antechamber at the court of Poesy.\"    \"But _what did_ you see? Did all the gods of the olden times pass  through the large saloons? Did the old heroes combat there? Did sweet  children play there, and relate their dreams?\"    \"I tell you I was there, and you can conceive that I saw everything  there was to be seen. Had you come over there, you would not have been  a man; but I became so! And besides, I learned to know my inward  nature, my innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the  time I was with you, I thought not of that, but always--you know it  well--when the sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so  strangely great; in the moonlight I was very near being more distinct  than yourself; at that time I did not understand my nature; it was  revealed to me in the antechamber! I became a man!--I came out  matured; but you were no longer in the warm lands;--as a man I was  ashamed to"]]]
