The seller, with  silken manners and brazen countenance, will always name a price four times  as large as it should be. Then the real business begins. The buyer offers  one half or one fourth of what he finally expects to pay; and a war of  words, in a blustering tone, leads up to the close of this every-day  farce.    The superstition of the Turks is nowhere so apparent as in their fear of  the \"evil eye.\" Jugs placed around the edge of the roof, or an old shoe  filled with garlic and blue beets (blue glass balls or rings) are a sure  guard against this illusion. Whenever a pretty child is playing upon the  street the passers-by will say: \"Oh, what an ugly child!\" for fear of  inciting the evil spirit against its beauty. The peasant classes in Turkey  are of course the most superstitious because they are the most ignorant.  They have no education whatever, and can neither read nor write. Stamboul  is the only great city of which they know. Paris is a term signifying the  whole outside world. An American missionary was once asked: \"In what part  of Paris is America?\" Yet it can be said that they are generally honest,  and always patient. They earn from about six to eight cents a day. This  will furnish them with ekmek and pilaff, and that is all they expect. They  eat meat only on feast-days, and then only mutton. The tax-gatherer is  their only grievance; they look upon him as a necessary evil. They have no  idea of being ground down under the oppressor's iron heel. Yet they are  happy because they are contented, and have no envy. The poorer, the more  ignorant, a Turk is, the better he seems to be. As he gets money and  power, and becomes \"contaminated\" by western civilization, he  deteriorates. A resident of twenty years' experience said: \"In the lowest  classes I have sometimes found truth, honesty, and gratitude; in the  middle classes, seldom; in the highest, never.\" The corruptibility of the  Turkish official is almost proverbial; but such is to be expected in the  land where \"the public treasury\" is regarded as a \"sea,\" and \"who does not  drink of it, as a pig.\" Peculation and malversation are fully expected in  the public official. They are necessary evils--_adet_ (custom) has made  them so. Offices are sold to the highest bidder. The Turkish official is  one of the politest and most agreeable of men. He is profuse in his  compliments, but he has no conscience as to bribes, and little regard for  virtue as its own reward. We are glad to be able to record a brilliant,  though perhaps theoretical, exception to this general rule. At  Koch-Hissar, on our way from Sivas to Kara Hissar, a delay was caused by a  rather serious break in one of our bicycles. In the interval we were the  invited guests of a district kadi, a venerable-looking and genial old  gentleman whose acquaintance we had made in an official visit on the  previous day, as he was then the acting _caimacam_ (mayor). His house was  situated in a neighboring valley in the shadow of a towering bluff. We  were ushered into the _selamluek_, or guest apartment, in company with an  Armenian friend who had been educated as a doctor in America, and who had  consented to act as interpreter for the occasion.    The kadi entered with a smile on his countenance, and made the usual  picturesque form of salutation by describing the figure 3 with his right  hand from the floor to his forehead. Perhaps it was because he wanted to  be polite that he said he had enjoyed our company on the previous day, and  had determined, if possible, to have a more extended conversation. With  the usual coffee and cigarettes, the kadi became informal and chatty. He  was evidently a firm believer in predestination, as he remarked that God  had foreordained our trip to that country, even the food we were to eat,  and the invention of the extraordinary \"cart\" on which we were to ride.  The idea of such a journey, in such a peculiar way, was not to be  accredited to the ingenuity of man. There was a purpose in it all. When we  ventured to thank him for his hospitality toward two strangers, and even  foreigners, he said that this world occupied so small a space in God's  dominion, that we could well afford to be brothers, one to another, in  spite of our individual beliefs and opinions. \"We may have different  religious beliefs,\" said he, \"but we all belong to the same great father  of humanity; just as children of different complexions, dispositions, and  intellects may belong to one common parent. We should exercise reason  always, and have charity for other people's opinions.\"    From charity the conversation naturally turned to justice. We were much  interested in his opinion on this subject, as that of a Turkish judge, and  rather high official. \"Justice,\" said he, \"should be administered to the  humblest person; though a king should be the offending party, all alike  must yield to the sacred law of justice. We must account to God for our  acts, and not to men.\"    The regular route from Sivas to Erzerum passes through Erzinjan. From  this, however, we diverged at Zara, in order to visit the city of Kara  Hissar, and the neighboring Lidjissy mines, which had been pioneered by  the Genoese explorers, and were now being worked by a party of Englishmen.  This divergence on to unbeaten paths was made at a very inopportune  season; for the rainy spell set in, which lasted, with scarcely any  intermission, for over a fortnight. At the base of Kosse Dagh, which  stands upon the watershed between the two largest rivers of Asia Minor,  the Kizil Irmak and Yeshil Irmak, our road was blocked by a mountain  freshet, which at its height washed everything before it. We spent a day  and night on its bank, in a primitive flour-mill, which was so far removed  from domestic life that we had to send three miles up in the mountains to  get something to eat. The Yeshil Irmak, which we crossed just before  reaching Kara Hissar, was above our shoulders as we waded through, holding  our bicycles and baggage over our heads; while the swift current rolled  the small boulders against us, and almost knocked us off our feet. There  were no bridges in this part of the country. With horses and wagons the  rivers were usually fordable; and what more would you want? With the Turk,  as with all Asiatics, it is not a question of what is better, but what  will do. Long before we reached a stream, the inhabitants of a certain  town or village would gather round, and with troubled countenances say,  \"Christian gentlemen--there is no bridge,\" pointing to the river beyond,  and graphically describing that it was over our horses' heads. That would  settle it, they thought; it never occurred to them that a \"Christian  gentleman\" could take off his clothes and wade. Sometimes, as we walked  along in the mud, the wheels of our bicycles would become so clogged that  we could not even push them before us. In such a case we would take the  nearest shelter, whatever it might be. The night before reaching Kara  Hissar, we entered an abandoned stable, from which everything had fled  except the fleas. Another night was spent in the pine-forests just on the  border between Asia Minor and Armenia, which were said to be the haunts of  the border robbers. Our surroundings could not be relieved by a fire for  fear of attracting their attention.      [Illustration: A FERRY IN ASIA MINOR.]    When at last we reached the Trebizond-Erzerum highway at Baiboot, the  contrast was so great that the scaling of Kop Dagh, on its comparatively  smooth surface, was a mere breakfast spell. From here we looked down for  the first time into the valley of the historic Euphrates, and a few hours  later we were skimming over its bottom lands toward the embattled heights  of Erzerum.    As we neared the city, some Turkish peasants in the fields caught sight of  us, and shouted to their companions: \"Russians! Russians! There they are!  Two of them!\" This was not the first time we had been taken for the  subjects of the Czar; the whole country seemed to be in dread of them.  Erzerum is the capital of that district which Russia will no doubt demand,  if the stipulated war indemnity is not paid.    The entrance into the city was made to twist and turn among the ramparts,  so as to avoid a rush in case of an attack. But this was no proof against  a surprise in the case of the noiseless wheel. In we dashed with a roaring  wind, past the affrighted guards, and were fifty yards away before they  could collect their scattered senses. Then suddenly it dawned upon them  that we were human beings, and foreigners besides--perhaps even the dreaded  Russian spies. They took after us at full speed, but it was too late.  Before they reached us we were in the house of the commandant pasha, the  military governor, to whom we had a letter of introduction from our consul  at Sivas. That gentleman we found extremely good-natured; he laughed  heartily at our escapade with the guards. Nothing would do but we must  visit the Vali, the civil governor, who was also a pasha of considerable  reputation and influence.      [Illustration: A VILLAGE SCENE.]    We had intended, but not so soon, to pay an official visit to the Vali to  present our letter from the Grand Vizir, and to ask his permission to  proceed to Bayazid, whence we had planned to attempt the ascent of Mount  Ararat, an experience which will be described in the next chapter. A few  days before, we heard, a similar application had been made by an English  traveler from Bagdad, but owing to certain suspicions the permission was  refused. It was with no little concern, therefore, that we approached the  Vali's private office in company with his French interpreter.

Peasant-maid       and little child were traced in original lines in the memory of       the scholar; he already admired the indolent _naivete_ of the       one, the prattling grace of the other. He had his eye also on       some smiling female neighbor, such as are to be found every       where; but the most attractive spectacle to him was that of       some strolling troop of dancers or country-players. On       fete-days sellers of elixirs, fortune-tellers, keepers of bears       and rattlesnakes, halted under his window. They were sure of a       spectator. Watteau suddenly fell into a profound revery at the       sight of Gilles and Margot upon the stage; nothing could divert       his attention from this amusement, not even the smile of his       female neighbor: he smiled at the grotesque coquetries of       Margot; he laughed till out of breath at the quips of Gilles.       He was frequently seen seated in the window, his legs out, his       head bent, holding on with difficulty, but not losing a word or       a gesture. What would he not have given to have been the       companion of Margot, to kiss the rusty spangles of her robe, to       live with her the happy life of careless adventure? Alas! this       happiness was not for him. Margot descended from the boards,       Gilles became a man as before, the theatre was taken down,       Watteau still on the watch; but by degrees he became sad; his       friends were departing, departing without him, with their gauze       dresses, their scarfs fringed with gold, their silver lace,       their silk breeches, and their jokes.--\"Those people are truly       happy,\" said he, \"they are going to wander gayly about the       world, to play comedy wherever they may be, without cares and       without tears!\"--Watteau, with his twelve-year-old eyes, saw       only the fair side of life. He did not guess, be it understood,       that beneath every smile of Margot there was a stifled tear.       Watteau seems to have always seen with the same eyes; his       glance, diverted by the expression and the color, did not       descend as far down as the soul. It was somewhat the fault of       his times. What had he to do while painting queens of comedy,       or dryads of the opera, with the heart, tears, or divine       sentiment?         \"After the strollers had departed, he sketched on the margins       of the 'Lives of the Saints,' the profile of Gilles, a gaping       clown, or some grotesque scene from the booth. As he often shut       himself up in his room with this book, his father, having       frequently surprised him in a dreamy and melancholy mood,       imagined that he was becoming religious. He, however, soon       discovered that Watteau's attachment to the folio was on       account of the margin, and not of the text. He carried the book       to a painter in the city. This painter, bad as he was, was       struck with the original grace of certain of Watteau's figures,       and solicited the honor of being his master. In the studio of       this worthy man, Watteau did not unlearn all that he had       acquired, although he painted for pedlers, male and female       saints by the dozen. From this studio he passed to another,       which was more profane and more to his taste. Mythology was the       great book of the place. Instead of St. Peter, with his eternal       keys, or the Magdalen, with her infinite tears, he found a       dance of fauns and naiads, Venus, issuing from the waves, or       from the net of Vulcan. Watteau bowed amorously before the gods       and demigods of Olympus; he had found the gate to his Eden. He       progressed daily, thanks to the profane gods, in the religion       of art. He was already seen to grow pale under that love of       beauty and of glory which swallows up all other loves. On his       return from a journey to Antwerp, his friends were astonished       at the enthusiasm with which he spoke of the wonders of art. He       had beheld the masterpieces of Rubens and Vandyke, the       ineffable grace of Murillo's _Virgins_, the       ingenuously-grotesque pieces of Teniers and Van Ostade, the       beautiful landscapes of Ruysdael. He returned with head bent       and eyes fatigued, and his mind filled with lasting       recollections.         \"He was not twenty when he set out for Paris with his master.       The opera, in its best days, enlisted the aid of all painters       of gracefulness. At the opera, Watteau threw the lightning       flashes of his pencil right and left: mountains, lakes,       cascades, forests, nothing dismayed him, not even the Camargos,       whom he had for models. He ended by taming himself down to this       cage of gayly-singing and fluttering birds. A dancing-girl, who       had not much to do, deigned to grant the little Flemish dauber,       the favor of sitting for her portrait. Fleming as he was,       Watteau made the progress of the portrait last longer than the       scornfulness of Mademoiselle la Montagne. This was not all: the       portrait was considered so graceful in the dancing-world, that       sitters came to him every day, on the same terms.         \"He left the opera with his master, as soon as the new       decorations were finished. Besides Gillot, the great designer       of fauns and naiads had returned there more flourishing than       ever. The master returned to Valenciennes, Watteau remained at       Paris, desiring to depend upon his fortune, good or bad. He       passed from the opera into the studio of a painter of       devotional subjects, who manufactured St. Nicholases for Paris       and the provinces, to suit to the price. So Watteau       manufactured St. Nicholases, 'My pencil,' he said, 'did       penance.' The opera always attracted him; there he could give       free scope to all the extravagance of his fancy, to all the       charming caprices of his pencil; but at the opera, his master       and himself had given way to Gillot; and the latter was not       disposed to give way to any body.\"    An allegro morceau from the life of Gretry:         A MONK OF A BAD PATTERN.         \"Other adventures also occurred, to convince Remacle that his       fellow-travellers were worthy of him. Ever in dread of the       before-mentioned officers, the old smuggler forced them to make       a _detour_ of some leagues, to see, as he said with a       disinterested air, a superb monastery, where alms were bestowed       once a week on all the poor of the country. On entering the       great hall, in the midst of a noisy crowd, Gretry saw a fat       monk, mounted on a platform, who was angrily superintending       this Christian charity. He looked as if he would like rather to       exterminate his fellow-creatures than aid them to live; he was       just bullying a poor French vagabond who implored his aid. When       he suddenly saw the noble face of Gretry he approached the       young musician.--'It is curiosity which brings you here,' he       remarked with vexation.--'It is true,' said Gretry, bowing;       'the beauty of your monastery, the sublimity of the scenery,       and the desire of contemplating the asylum where the       unfortunate traveller is received with so much humanity, have       drawn us from our route. In beholding you, I have seen the       angel of mercy. All the victims of sorrow should bless your       edifying gentleness. Tell me, father, do you make as many happy       every day as I have just witnessed?'         \"The monk, irritated by this bantering, begged Gretry to return       whence he came.--'Father,' retorted Gretry, 'have the       evangelists taught you this mode of bestowing alms, giving with       one hand and striking with the other?'--A low murmur was heard       through the hall; the monk not knowing what to say, complained       of the toothache; the cunning student lost no time, but running       up to him with an air of touching compassion, 'I am a surgeon,'       he said, as he forced him down on the bench. The monk tried to       push him off, but he held on well. 'It is Heaven which has       directed me to you, father.' Willing or not, the monk had to       open his mouth. 'Courage, father, the great saints were all       martyrs! the Saviour was crucified; and you may at least let me       pull out a tooth.' The monk struggled: 'Never, never!' he       exclaimed. The student turned with great coolness toward the       bystanders, who were all laughing in their sleeves. 'My       friends,' (he addressed crippled travellers, mountain-brigands,       and poor people of every class,) 'my friends, for the love of       God, who suffered, come and hold this good father: I do not       want him to suffer any longer!'         \"The beggars understood the joke; four of them separated from       the group, and came to the surgeon's aid. The monk struggled       furiously, but it was no use to kick and scream; he had to       submit, Gretry was not the last to come to his friend's aid;       the malicious student seized the first tooth he got hold of,       and wrenched the head of the monk by a turn of his elbow, to       the great joy of the beggars, who saw themselves revenged in a       most opportune manner. 'Well, father, what do you think of it?'       asked Gretry, after the operation; 'I am sure you do not now       suffer at all!'--The monk shook with rage; the other monks       attracted by his cries, soon arrived, but it was too late.\"    The following is among the most touching of narratives. It is  exquisitely delivered:         GRETRY'S THREE DAUGHTERS         \"Gretry was therefore happy. Happy in his wife and children, in       his old mother, who had come to sanctify his house, with her       sweet and venerable face. Happy in fortune,"]]]
