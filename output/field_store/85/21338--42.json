I like them very well; but you see I had to give them  a lesson. When they brought me to James and told him I think he was very  angry to see such big sticks. He said they were only fit for drovers or  gypsies, and not for young gentlemen.\"    \"If I had been you,\" said Ginger, \"I would have given those boys a good  kick, and that would have given them a lesson.\"    \"No doubt you would,\" said Merrylegs; \"but then I am not quite such a  fool (begging your pardon) as to anger our master or make James ashamed  of me. Besides, those children are under my charge when they are riding;  I tell you they are intrusted to me. Why, only the other day I heard our  master say to Mrs. Blomefield, 'My dear madam, you need not be anxious  about the children; my old Merrylegs will take as much care of them as  you or I could; I assure you I would not sell that pony for any money,  he is so perfectly good-tempered and trustworthy;' and do you think I am  such an ungrateful brute as to forget all the kind treatment I have  had here for five years, and all the trust they place in me, and turn  vicious because a couple of ignorant boys used me badly? No, no! you  never had a good place where they were kind to you, and so you don't  know, and I'm sorry for you; but I can tell you good places make good  horses. I wouldn't vex our people for anything; I love them, I do,\" said  Merrylegs, and he gave a low \"ho, ho, ho!\" through his nose, as he used  to do in the morning when he heard James' footstep at the door.    \"Besides,\" he went on, \"if I took to kicking where should I be? Why,  sold off in a jiffy, and no character, and I might find myself slaved  about under a butcher's boy, or worked to death at some seaside place  where no one cared for me, except to find out how fast I could go, or be  flogged along in some cart with three or four great men in it going out  for a Sunday spree, as I have often seen in the place I lived in before  I came here; no,\" said he, shaking his head, \"I hope I shall never come  to that.\"          10 A Talk in the Orchard      Ginger and I were not of the regular tall carriage horse breed, we had  more of the racing blood in us. We stood about fifteen and a half hands  high; we were therefore just as good for riding as we were for driving,  and our master used to say that he disliked either horse or man that  could do but one thing; and as he did not want to show off in London  parks, he preferred a more active and useful kind of horse. As for us,  our greatest pleasure was when we were saddled for a riding party; the  master on Ginger, the mistress on me, and the young ladies on Sir Oliver  and Merrylegs. It was so cheerful to be trotting and cantering all  together that it always put us in high spirits. I had the best of it,  for I always carried the mistress; her weight was little, her voice was  sweet, and her hand was so light on the rein that I was guided almost  without feeling it.    Oh! if people knew what a comfort to horses a light hand is, and how it  keeps a good mouth and a good temper, they surely would not chuck, and  drag, and pull at the rein as they often do. Our mouths are so tender  that where they have not been spoiled or hardened with bad or ignorant  treatment, they feel the slightest movement of the driver's hand, and  we know in an instant what is required of us. My mouth has never been  spoiled, and I believe that was why the mistress preferred me to Ginger,  although her paces were certainly quite as good. She used often to envy  me, and said it was all the fault of breaking in, and the gag bit in  London, that her mouth was not so perfect as mine; and then old Sir  Oliver would say, \"There, there! don't vex yourself; you have the  greatest honor; a mare that can carry a tall man of our master's weight,  with all your spring and sprightly action, does not need to hold her  head down because she does not carry the lady; we horses must take  things as they come, and always be contented and willing so long as we  are kindly used.\"    I had often wondered how it was that Sir Oliver had such a very short  tail; it really was only six or seven inches long, with a tassel of hair  hanging from it; and on one of our holidays in the orchard I ventured to  ask him by what accident it was that he had lost his tail. \"Accident!\"  he snorted with a fierce look, \"it was no accident! it was a cruel,  shameful, cold-blooded act! When I was young I was taken to a place  where these cruel things were done; I was tied up, and made fast so that  I could not stir, and then they came and cut off my long and beautiful  tail, through the flesh and through the bone, and took it away.    \"How dreadful!\" I exclaimed.    \"Dreadful, ah! it was dreadful; but it was not only the pain, though  that was terrible and lasted a long time; it was not only the indignity  of having my best ornament taken from me, though that was bad; but it  was this, how could I ever brush the flies off my sides and my hind legs  any more? You who have tails just whisk the flies off without thinking  about it, and you can't tell what a torment it is to have them settle  upon you and sting and sting, and have nothing in the world to lash them  off with. I tell you it is a lifelong wrong, and a lifelong loss; but  thank heaven, they don't do it now.\"    \"What did they do it for then?\" said Ginger.    \"For fashion!\" said the old horse with a stamp of his foot; \"for  fashion! if you know what that means; there was not a well-bred young  horse in my time that had not his tail docked in that shameful way, just  as if the good God that made us did not know what we wanted and what  looked best.\"    \"I suppose it is fashion that makes them strap our heads up with those  horrid bits that I was tortured with in London,\" said Ginger.    \"Of course it is,\" said he; \"to my mind, fashion is one of the wickedest  things in the world. Now look, for instance, at the way they serve dogs,  cutting off their tails to make them look plucky, and shearing up their  pretty little ears to a point to make them both look sharp, forsooth. I  had a dear friend once, a brown terrier; 'Skye' they called her. She was  so fond of me that she never would sleep out of my stall; she made  her bed under the manger, and there she had a litter of five as pretty  little puppies as need be; none were drowned, for they were a valuable  kind, and how pleased she was with them! and when they got their eyes  open and crawled about, it was a real pretty sight; but one day the man  came and took them all away; I thought he might be afraid I should tread  upon them. But it was not so; in the evening poor Skye brought them back  again, one by one in her mouth; not the happy little things that they  were, but bleeding and crying pitifully; they had all had a piece of  their tails cut off, and the soft flap of their pretty little ears was  cut quite off. How their mother licked them, and how troubled she was,  poor thing! I never forgot it. They healed in time, and they forgot the  pain, but the nice soft flap, that of course was intended to protect the  delicate part of their ears from dust and injury, was gone forever. Why  don't they cut their own children's ears into points to make them look  sharp? Why don't they cut the end off their noses to make them look  plucky? One would be just as sensible as the other. What right have they  to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\"    Sir Oliver, though he was so gentle, was a fiery old fellow, and what  he said was all so new to me, and so dreadful, that I found a bitter  feeling toward men rise up in my mind that I never had before. Of course  Ginger was very much excited; she flung up her head with flashing  eyes and distended nostrils, declaring that men were both brutes and  blockheads.    \"Who talks about blockheads?\" said Merrylegs, who just came up from  the old apple-tree, where he had been rubbing himself against the low  branch. \"Who talks about blockheads? I believe that is a bad word.\"    \"Bad words were made for bad things,\" said Ginger, and she told him what  Sir Oliver had said.    \"It is all true,\" said Merrylegs sadly, \"and I've seen that about the  dogs over and over again where I lived first; but we won't talk about  it here. You know that master, and John and James are always good to  us, and talking against men in such a place as this doesn't seem fair  or grateful, and you know there are good masters and good grooms beside  ours, though of course ours are the best.\"    This wise speech of good little Merrylegs, which we knew was quite true,  cooled us all down, especially Sir Oliver, who was dearly fond of his  master; and to turn the subject I said, \"Can any one tell me the use of  blinkers?\"    \"No!\" said Sir Oliver shortly, \"because they are no use.\"    \"They are supposed,\" said Justice, the roan cob, in his calm way, \"to  prevent horses from shying and starting, and getting so frightened as to  cause accidents.\"    \"Then what is the reason they do not put them on riding horses;  especially on ladies' horses?\" said I.    \"There is no reason at all,\" said he quietly, \"except the fashion; they  say that a horse would be so frightened to see the wheels of his own  cart or carriage coming behind him that he would be sure to run away,  although of course when he is ridden he sees them all about him if the  streets are crowded. I admit they do sometimes come too close to be  pleasant, but we don't run away; we are used to it, and understand it,  and if we never had blinkers put on we should never want them; we should  see what was there, and know what was what, and be much less frightened  than by only seeing bits of things that we can't understand. Of course  there may be some nervous horses who have been hurt or frightened when  they were young, who may be the better for them; but as I never was  nervous, I can't judge.\"    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#6)"],[1,"even purely and simply his own individual personal interest,  might be at stake. He moreover added to the declarations he had already  made, that the soldier sent to M. du Vallon was his own messenger,  and that the only object that letter had in view was to announce his  intended arrival. From that moment, no one opposed D'Artagnan's entrance  any further, and he entered accordingly. A valet wished to accompany  him, but he answered that it was useless to take that trouble on his  account, inasmuch as he knew perfectly well where M. du Vallon was.  There was nothing, of course, to say to a man so thoroughly and  completely informed on all points, and D'Artagnan was permitted,  therefore, to do as he liked. The terraces, the magnificent apartments,  the gardens, were all reviewed and narrowly inspected by the musketeer.  He walked for a quarter of an hour in this more than royal residence,  which included as many wonders as articles of furniture, and as many  servants as there were columns and doors. \"Decidedly,\" he said to  himself, \"this mansion has no other limits than the pillars of the  habitable world. Is it probable Porthos has taken it into his head to go  back to Pierrefonds without even leaving M. Fouquet's house?\" He finally  reached a remote part of the chateau inclosed by a stone wall, which was  covered with a profusion of thick plants, luxuriant in blossoms as large  and solid as fruit. At equal distances on the top of this wall were  placed various statues in timid or mysterious attitudes. These were  vestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum, with its thick, sinuous  folds; agile nymphs, covered with their marble veils, and guarding the  palace with their fugitive glances. A statue of Hermes, with his  finger on his lips; one of Iris, with extended wings; another of Night,  sprinkled all over with poppies, dominated the gardens and outbuildings,  which could be seen through the trees. All these statues threw in white  relief their profiles upon the dark ground of the tall cypresses, which  darted their somber summits towards the sky. Around these cypresses were  entwined climbing roses, whose flowering rings were fastened to every  fork of the branches, and spread over the lower boughs and the various  statues, showers of flowers of the rarest fragrance. These enchantments  seemed to the musketeer the result of the greatest efforts of the human  mind. He felt in a dreamy, almost poetical, frame of mind. The idea  that Porthos was living in so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of  Porthos, showing how tremendously true it is, that even the very highest  orders of minds are not quite exempt from the influence of surroundings.  D'Artagnan found the door, and on, or rather in the door, a kind  of spring which he detected; having touched it, the door flew open.  D'Artagnan entered, closed the door behind him, and advanced into a  pavilion built in a circular form, in which no other sound could be  heard but cascades and the songs of birds. At the door of the pavilion  he met a lackey.    \"It is here, I believe,\" said D'Artagnan, without hesitation, \"that M.  le Baron du Vallon is staying?\"    \"Yes, monsieur,\" answered the lackey.    \"Have the goodness to tell him that M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan, captain  of the king's musketeers, is waiting to see him.\"    D'Artagnan was introduced into the _salon_, and had not long to remain  in expectation: a well-remembered step shook the floor of the adjoining  room, a door opened, or rather flew open, and Porthos appeared and threw  himself into his friend's arms with a sort of embarrassment which did  not ill become him. \"You here?\" he exclaimed.    \"And you?\" replied D'Artagnan. \"Ah, you sly fellow!\"    \"Yes,\" said Porthos, with a somewhat embarrassed smile; \"yes, you see  I am staying in M. Fouquet's house, at which you are not a little  surprised, I suppose?\"    \"Not at all; why should you not be one of M. Fouquet's friends? M.  Fouquet has a very large number, particularly among clever men.\"    Porthos had the modesty not to take the compliment to himself.  \"Besides,\" he added, \"you saw me at Belle-Isle.\"    \"A greater reason for my believing you to be one of M. Fouquet's  friends.\"    \"The fact is, I am acquainted with him,\" said Porthos, with a certain  embarrassment of manner.    \"Ah, friend Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"how treacherously you have  behaved towards me.\"    \"In what way?\" exclaimed Porthos.    \"What! you complete so admirable a work as the fortifications of  Belle-Isle, and you did not tell me of it!\" Porthos colored. \"Nay, more  than that,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"you saw me out yonder, you know I  am in the king's service, and yet you could not guess that the king,  jealously desirous of learning the name of the man whose abilities had  wrought a work of which he heard the most wonderful accounts,--you could  not guess, I say, that the king sent me to learn who this man was?\"    \"What! the king sent you to learn--\"    \"Of course; but don't let us speak of that any more.\"    \"Not speak of it!\" said Porthos; \"on the contrary, we will speak of it;  and so the king knew that we were fortifying Belle-Isle?\"    \"Of course; does not the king know everything?\"    \"But he did not know who was fortifying it?\"    \"No, he only suspected, from what he had been told of the nature of the  works, that it was some celebrated soldier or another.\"    \"The devil!\" said Porthos, \"if I had only known that!\"    \"You would not have run away from Vannes as you did, perhaps?\"    \"No; what did you say when you couldn't find me?\"    \"My dear fellow, I reflected.\"    \"Ah, indeed; you reflect, do you? Well, and what did that reflection  lead to?\"    \"It led me to guess the whole truth.\"    \"Come, then, tell me what did you guess after all?\" said Porthos,  settling himself into an armchair, and assuming the airs of a sphinx.    \"I guessed, in the first place, that you were fortifying Belle-Isle.\"    \"There was no great difficulty in that, for you saw me at work.\"    \"Wait a minute; I also guessed something else,--that you were fortifying  Belle-Isle by M. Fouquet's orders.\"    \"That's true.\"    \"But even that is not all. Whenever I feel myself in trim for guessing,  I do not stop on my road; and so I guessed that M. Fouquet wished to  preserve the most absolute secrecy respecting these fortifications.\"    \"I believe that was his intention, in fact,\" said Porthos.    \"Yes, but do you know why he wished to keep it secret?\"    \"In order it should not become known, perhaps,\" said Porthos.    \"That was his principal reason. But his wish was subservient to a bit of  generosity--\"    \"In fact,\" said Porthos, \"I have heard it said that M. Fouquet was a very  generous man.\"    \"To a bit of generosity he wished to exhibit towards the king.\"    \"Oh, oh!\"    \"You seem surprised at that?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you didn't guess?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, I know it, then.\"    \"You are a wizard.\"    \"Not at all, I assure you.\"    \"How do you know it, then?\"    \"By a very simple means. I heard M. Fouquet himself say so to the king.\"    \"Say what to the king?\"    \"That he fortified Belle-Isle on his majesty's account, and that he had  made him a present of Belle Isle.\"    \"And you heard M. Fouquet say that to the king?\"    \"In those very words. He even added: 'Belle-Isle has been fortified by  an engineer, one of my friends, a man of a great deal of merit, whom I  shall ask your majesty's permission to present to you.'    \"'What is his name?' said the king.    \"'The Baron du Vallon,' M. Fouquet replied.    \"'Very well,' returned his majesty, 'you will present him to me.'\"    \"The king said that?\"    \"Upon the word of a D'Artagnan!\"    \"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos. \"Why have I not been presented, then?\"    \"Have they not spoken to you about this presentation?\"    \"Yes, certainly; but I am always kept waiting for it.\"    \"Be easy, it will be sure to come.\"    \"Humph! humph!\" grumbled Porthos, which D'Artagnan pretended not to  hear; and, changing the conversation, he said, \"You seem to be living in  a very solitary place here, my dear fellow?\"    \"I always preferred retirement. I am of a melancholy disposition,\"  replied Porthos, with a sigh.    \"Really, that is odd,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I never remarked that before.\"    \"It is only since I have taken to reading,\" said Porthos, with a  thoughtful air.    \"But the labors of the mind have not affected the health of the body, I  trust?\"    \"Not in the slightest degree.\"    \"Your strength is as great as ever?\"    \"Too great, my friend, too great.\"    \"Ah! I had heard that, for a short time after your arrival--\"    \"That I could hardly move a limb, I suppose?\"    \"How was it?\" said D'Artagnan, smiling, \"and why was it you could not  move?\"    Porthos, perceiving that he had made a mistake, wished to correct it.  \"Yes, I came from Belle-Isle upon very hard horses,\" he said, \"and that  fatigued me.\"    \"I am no longer astonished, then, since I, who followed you, found seven  or eight lying dead on the road.\"    \"I am very heavy, you know,\" said Porthos.    \"So that you were bruised all over.\"    \"My marrow melted, and that made me very ill.\"    \"Poor Porthos! But how did Aramis act towards you under those  circumstances?\"    \"Very well, indeed. He had me attended to by M. Fouquet's own doctor.  But just imagine, at the end of a week I could not breathe any longer.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"The room was too small; I had absorbed every atom of air.\"    \"Indeed?\"    \"I was told so, at least; and so I was removed into another apartment.\"    \"Where you were able to breathe, I hope and trust?\"    \"Yes, more freely; but no exercise--nothing to do. The doctor pretended  that I was not to stir; I, on the contrary, felt that I was stronger  than ever; that was the cause of a very serious accident.\"    \"What accident?\"    \"Fancy, my dear fellow, that I revolted against the directions of that  ass of a doctor, and I resolved to go out, whether it suited him or "]]]
