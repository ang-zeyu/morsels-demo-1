Her face began to get  very red, and she straightened up so suddenly to show Polly just how  very big she was that her little head came up against the edge of the  tub--over it went! a pile of saucers followed.    \"There now,\" cried Polly, \"see what you've done!\"    \"Ow!\" whimpered Phronsie, breaking into a subdued roar; \"oh, Polly! it's  all running down my back.\"    \"Is it?\" said Polly, bursting out into a laugh; \"never mind, Phronsie,  I'll dry you.\"    \"Dear me, Polly!\" said Mrs. Pepper, who had looked up in time to see the  tub racing along by itself towards the \"Provision Room\" door, a stream  of dish-water following in its wake, \"she will be wet clear through; do  get off her things, quick.\"    \"Yes'm,\" cried Polly, picking up the tub, and giving two or three quick  sops to the floor. \"Here you are, Pussy,\" grasping Phronsie, crying as  she was, and carrying her into the bedroom.    \"Oh, dear,\" wailed the child, still holding the wet dish towel; \"I won't  ever do it again, if you'll only let me do 'em all to-morrow.\"    \"When you're big and strong,\" said Polly, giving her a hug, \"you shall  do 'em every day.\"    \"May I really?\" said little Phronsie, blinking through the tears, and  looking radiant.    \"Yes, truly--every day.\"    \"Then I'll grow right away, I will,\" said Phronsie, bursting out  merrily; and she sat down and pulled off the well-worn shoes, into which  a big pool of dish-water had run, while Polly went for dry stockings.    \"So you shall,\" said Polly, coming back, a big piece of gingerbread in  her hand; \"and this'll make you grow, Phronsie.\"    \"O-o-h!\" and Phronsie's little white teeth shut down quickly on the  comforting morsel. Gingerbread didn't come often enough into the Pepper  household to be lightly esteemed.    \"Now,\" said Mrs. Pepper, when order was restored, the floor washed  up brightly, and every cup and platter in place, hobnobbing away to  themselves on the shelves of the old corner cupboard, and Polly had come  as usual with needle and thread to help mother--Polly was getting so  that she could do the plain parts on the coats and jackets, which  filled her with pride at the very thought--\"now,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"you  needn't help me this morning, Polly: I'm getting on pretty smart; but  you may just run down to the parson's, and see how he is.\"    \"Is he sick?\" asked Polly, in awe.    To have the parson sick, was something quite different from an ordinary  person's illness.    \"He's taken with a chill,\" said Mrs. Pepper, biting off a thread, \"so  Miss Huldy Folsom told me last night, and I'm afraid he's going to have  a fever.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly, in dire distress; \"whatever'd we do, mammy!\"    \"Don't know, I'm sure,\" replied Mrs. Pepper, setting her stitches  firmly; \"the Lord'll provide. So you run along, child, and see how he  is.\"    \"Can't Phronsie go?\" asked Polly, pausing half-way to the bedroom door.    \"Well, yes, I suppose she might,\" said Mrs. Pepper, assentingly.    \"No, she can't either,\" said Polly, coming back with her sun-bonnet in  her hand, and shutting the door carefully after her, \"cause she's fast  asleep on the floor.\"    \"Is she?\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"well, she's been running so this morning,  she's tired out, I s'pose.\"    \"And her face is dreadfully red,\" continued Polly, tying on her bonnet;  \"now, what'll I say, mammy?\"    \"Well, I should think 'twould be,\" said Mrs. Pepper, replying to the  first half of Polly's speech; \"she cried so. Well, you just tell Mrs.  Henderson your ma wants to know how Mr. Henderson is this morning, and  if 'twas a chill he had yesterday, and how he slept last night, and--\"    \"Oh, ma,\" said Polly, \"I can't ever remember all that.\"    \"Oh, yes, you can,\" said Mrs. Pepper, encouragingly; \"just put your mind  on it, Polly; 'tisn't anything to what I used to have to remember--when  I was a little girl, no bigger than you are.\"    Polly sighed, and feeling sure that something must be the matter with  her mind, gave her whole attention to the errand; till at last after a  multiplicity of messages and charges not to forget any one of them, Mrs.  Pepper let her depart.    Up to the old-fashioned green door, with its brass knocker, Polly went,  running over in her mind just which of the messages she ought to give  first. She couldn't for her life think whether \"if 'twas a chill he had  yesterday?\" ought to come before \"how he slept?\" She knocked timidly,  hoping Mrs. Henderson would help her out of her difficulty by telling  her without the asking. All other front doors in Badgertown were  ornaments, only opened on grand occasions, like a wedding or a funeral.  But the minister's was accessible alike to all. So Polly let fall the  knocker, and awaited the answer.    A scuffling noise sounded along the passage; and then Polly's soul sank  down in dire dismay. It was the minister's sister, and not gentle little  Mrs. Henderson. She never could get on with Miss Jerusha in the least.  She made her feel as she told her mother once--\"as if I don't know what  my name is.\" And now here she was; and all those messages.    Miss Jerusha unbolted the door, slid back the great bar, opened the  upper half, and stood there. She was a big woman, with sharp black eyes,  and spectacles--over which she looked--which to Polly was much worse,  for that gave her four eyes.    \"Well, and what do you want?\" she asked.    \"I came to see--I mean my ma sent me,\" stammered poor Polly.    \"And who is your ma?\" demanded Miss Jerusha, as much like a policeman as  anything; \"and where do you live?\"    \"I live in Primrose Lane,\" replied Polly, wishing very much that she was  back there.    \"I don't want to know where you live, before I know who you are,\" said  Miss Jerusha; \"you should answer the question I asked first; always  remember that.\"    \"My ma's Mrs. Pepper,\" said Polly.    \"Mrs. who?\" repeated Miss Jerusha.    By this time Polly was so worn that she came very near turning and  fleeing, but she thought of her mother's disappointment in her, and the  loss of the news, and stood quite still.    \"What is it, Jerusha?\" a gentle voice here broke upon Polly's ear.    \"I don't know,\" responded Miss Jerusha, tartly, still holding the door  much as if Polly were a robber; \"it's a little girl, and I can't make  out what she wants.\"    \"Why, it's Polly Pepper!\" exclaimed Mrs. Henderson, pleasantly. \"Come  in, child.\" She opened the other half of the big door, and led the  way through the wide hall into a big, old-fashioned room, with painted  floor, and high, old side-board, and some stiff-backed rocking-chairs.    Miss Jerusha stalked in also and seated herself by the window, and began  to knit. Polly had just opened her mouth to tell her errand, when the  door also opened suddenly and Mr. Henderson walked in.    \"Oh!\" said Polly, and then she stopped, and the color flushed up into  her face.    \"What is it, my dear?\" and the minister took her hand kindly, and looked  down into her flushed face.    \"You are not going to have a fever, and be sick and die!\" she cried.    \"I hope not, my little girl,\" he smiled back, encouragingly; and then  Polly gave her messages, which now she managed easily enough.    \"There,\" broke in Miss Jerusha, \"a cat can't sneeze in this town but  everybody'll know it in quarter of an hour.\"    And then Mrs. Henderson took Polly out to see a brood of new little  chicks, that had just popped their heads out into the world; and to  Polly, down on her knees, admiring, the time passed very swiftly indeed.    \"Now I must go, ma'am,\" she said at last, looking up into the lady's  face, regretfully, \"for mammy didn't say I was to stay.\"    \"Very well, dear; do you think you could carry a little pat of butter?  I have some very nice my sister sent me, and I want your mother to share  it.\"    \"Oh, thank you, ma'am!\" cried Polly, thinking, \"how glad Davie'll be,  for he does so love butter! only--\"    \"Wait a bit, then,\" said Mrs. Henderson, who didn't seem to notice the  objection. So she went into the house, and Polly went down again in  admiration before the fascinating little puff-balls.    But she was soon on the way, with a little pat of butter in a blue bowl,  tied over with a clean cloth; happy in her gift for mammy, and in the  knowledge of the minister being all well.    \"I wonder if Phronsie's awake,\" she thought to herself, turning in at  the little brown gate; \"if she is, she shall have a piece of bread with  lots of butter.\"    \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Pepper, from the rocking-chair in the middle of the  floor. She had something in her arms. Polly stopped suddenly, almost  letting the bowl fall.    \"It's Phronsie,\" said the mother, \"and I don't know what the matter is  with her; you'll have to go for the doctor, Polly, and just as fast as  you can.\"    Polly still stood, holding the bowl, and staring with all her might.  Phronsie sick!    \"Don't wake her,\" said Mrs. Pepper.    Poor Polly couldn't have stirred to save her life, for a minute; then  she said--\"Where shall I go?\"    \"Oh, run to Dr. Fisher's; and don't be gone long.\"    Polly set down the bowl of butter, and sped on the wings of the wind for  the doctor. Something dreadful was the matter, she felt, for never had  a physician been summoned to the hearty Pepper family since she could  remember, only when the father died. Fear lent speed to her feet; and  soon the doctor came, and bent over poor little Phronsie, who still lay  in her mother's arms, in a burning fever.    \"It's measles,\" he pronounced, \"that's all; no cause for alarm; you ever  had it?\" he asked, turning suddenly around on Polly, who was watching  with wide-open eyes for the verdict.    \"No, sir,\" answered Polly, not knowing in the least what \"measles\" was.    \"What shall we do!\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"there haven't any of them had  it.\"    The doctor was over by the little old table under the window, mixing up  some black-looking stuff in a tumbler, and he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#6)"],[1,"to  this heat being sufficient.    _Ether Flame._--In an emergency small instruments, needles, etc., may be  sterilised by dipping them in ether and after removal lighting the  adherent fluid and allowing it to burn off the surface of the  instruments. Repeat the process twice. It may then be safely assumed  that the apparatus so treated is sterile.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Muffle furnace.]    _Muffle Furnace_ (Fig. 25).--Although this form of heat is chiefly used  for the destruction of the dead bodies of small infected animals, morbid  tissues, etc., it is also employed for the sterilisation of porcelain  filter candles (_vide_ p. 42).    Filter candles are disinfected immediately after use by boiling in a  beaker of water for some fifteen or twenty minutes. This treatment,  however, leaves the dead bodies of the bacteria upon the surface and  blocking the interstices of the filter.    To destroy the organic matter and prepare the filter candle for further  use proceed as follows:    1. Roll each bougie up in a piece of asbestos cloth, secure the ends of  the cloth with a few turns of copper wire, and place inside the muffle  (a small muffle 76x88x163 mm. will hold perhaps four small filter  candles).    2. Light the gas and raise the contents of the muffle to a white heat;  maintain this temperature for five minutes.    3. Extinguish the gas, and when the muffle has become quite cold remove  the filter candles, and store them (without removing the asbestos  wrappings) in sterile metal boxes.         NOTE.--The too rapid cooling of the candles, such as takes       place if they are removed from the muffle before it has       cooled down to the room temperature, may give rise to       microscopic cracks and flaws which will effectually destroy       their efficiency.    _Hot Air._--Hot air at 150 deg. C. destroys all bacteria, spores, etc:, in  about thirty minutes; a momentary exposure to a temperature of 175 deg. to  180 deg. C. will effect the same result and offers the more convenient  method of sterilisation. This method is only applicable to glass and  metallic substances, and the small bulk of cotton-wool comprised in the  test-tube plugs, etc. Large masses of fabric are not effectually  sterilised by dry heat--short of charring--as its power of penetration  is not great.    Sterilisation by hot air is effected in the hot-air oven (Fig. 18). This  is a rectangular, double-walled metal box, mounted on a stand and heated  from below by a large Bunsen burner. The interior of the oven is  provided with loose shelves upon which the articles to be sterilised are  arranged, either singly or packed in square wire baskets or crates, kept  specially for this purpose. One of the sides is hinged to form a door.  The central portion of the metal bottom, on which the Bunsen flame would  play, is cut away, and replaced by firebrick plates, which slide in  metal grooves and are easily replaced when broken or worn out. The top  of the oven is provided with a perforated ventilator slide and two  tubulures, the one for the reception of a centigrade thermometer  graduated to 200 deg. or 250 deg. C., the other for a thermo-regulator. An  ordinary mercurial thermo-regulator may be used but it is preferable to  employ a regulating capsule of the Hearson type (see p. 219) with a  spring arm adjusted to the lever so that when the boiling-point of the  capsule (e. g., 175 deg. C.) is reached the gas supply is absolutely cut  off and the jet cannot again be lighted until the spring-arm has been  readjusted by hand. The thermo-regulator is by no means a necessity, and  may be replaced by a large bore thermometer with a sliding platinum  point, connected with an electric bell, which can be easily adjusted to  ring at any given temperature. Even if the steriliser is provided with  the capsule regulator above described the contact thermometer should  also be fitted.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Hot-air oven.]      TO USE THE HOT-AIR OVEN.--    1. Place the crates of test-tubes, metal cases containing plates and  pipettes, loose apparatus, etc., inside the oven, taking particular care  that none of the cotton-wool plugs are in contact with the walls,  otherwise the heat transmitted by the metal will char or even flame  them.         To prepare a wire crate for the reception of test-tubes,       etc., cover the bottom with a layer of thick asbestos cloth;       or take some asbestos fibre, moisten it with a little water       and knead it into a paste; plaster the paste over the bottom       of the crate, working it into the meshes and smoothing the       surface by means of a pestle. When several crates have been       thus treated, place them inside the hot-air oven, close the       door, open the ventilating slide, light the gas, and run the       temperature of the interior up to about 160 deg. C. After an       interval of ten minutes extinguish the gas, open the oven       door, and allow the contents to cool. The asbestos now forms       a smooth, dry, spongy layer over the bottom, which will last       many months before needing renewal, and will considerably       diminish the loss of tubes from breakage.         Copper cylinders and large test-tubes intended for the       reception of pipettes are prepared in a similar manner, in       order to protect the points of these articles from injury.    2. Close the oven door, and open the ventilating slide, in order that  any moisture left in the tubes, etc., may escape; light the gas below;  set the electric alarm to ring at 100 deg. C.    3. When the temperature of the oven has reached 100 deg. C., close the  ventilating slide; reset the alarm to ring at 175 deg. C.    4. Run the temperature up to 175 deg. C.    5. Extinguish the gas at once, and allow the apparatus to cool.    6. When the temperature of the interior, as recorded by the thermometer,  has fallen to 60 deg. C.--_but not before_--the door may be opened and  the sterile articles removed and stored away.         NOTE.--Neglect of this precautionary cooling of the oven to       60 deg. C. will result in numerous cracked and broken tubes.    On removal from the oven, the cotton-wool plugs will probably be  slightly brown in colour.    Metal instruments, such as knives, scissors, and forceps, may be  sterilised in the hot-air oven as described above, but exposure to 175 deg.  C. is likely to seriously affect the temper of the steel and certainly  blunts the cutting edges. If, however, it is desired to sterilise  surgical instruments by hot air, they should be packed in a metal box,  or boxes, and heated to 130 deg. C. and retained at that temperature for  about thirty minutes.    ~Moist Heat.~--_Water at 56 deg. C._--This temperature, if maintained for  thirty minutes, is sufficient to destroy the vegetative forms of  bacteria, but has practically no effect on spores. Its use is limited to  the sterilisation of such albuminous \"fluid\" media as would coagulate at  a higher temperature.    METHOD.--    1. Fit up a water-bath, heated by a Bunsen flame which is controlled by  a thermo-regulator, so that the temperature of the water remains at 56  deg. C.    2. Immerse the tubes or flasks containing the albuminous fluid in the  water-bath so that the upper level of such fluid is at least 2 cm. below  the level of the water. (The temperature of the bath will now fall  somewhat, but after a few minutes will again rise to 56 deg. C).    3. After thirty minutes' exposure to 56 deg. C, extinguish the gas, remove  the tubes or flasks from the bath, and subject them to the action of  running water so that their contents are rapidly cooled.    4. The vegetative forms of bacteria present in the liquid being killed,  stand it for twenty-four hours in a cool, dark place; at the end of that  time some at least of such spores as may be present will have germinated  and assumed the vegetative form.    5. Destroy these new vegetative forms by a similar exposure to 56 deg. C.  on the second day, whilst others, of slower germination, may be caught on  the third day, and so on.    6. In order to ensure thorough sterilisation, repeat the process on each  of six successive days.    This method of exposing liquids to a temperature of 56 deg. C. in a  water-bath for half an hour on each of six successive days is termed  _fractional sterilisation_.    _Water at 100 deg. C._ destroys the vegetative forms of bacteria almost  instantaneously, and spores in from five to fifteen minutes. This method  of sterilisation is applicable to the metal instruments, such as knives,  forceps, etc., used in animal experiments; syringes, rubber corks,  rubber and glass tubing, and other small apparatus, and is effected in  what is usually spoken of as the \"water steriliser\" (Fig. 27).    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Water sterilizer.]    This is a rectangular copper box, 26 cm. long, 18 cm. wide, and 12 cm.  deep, mounted on legs, heated from below by a Bunsen or radial gas  burner, and containing a movable copper wire tray, 2 cm. smaller in  every dimension than the steriliser itself, and provided with handles.  The top of the steriliser is hinged to form a lid.    METHOD.--    1. Place the instruments, etc., to be sterilised inside the copper  basket, and replace the basket in the steriliser.    2. Pour a sufficient quantity of water into the steriliser, shut down  the lid, and light the gas below.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Koch's steriliser.]    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Arnold's steriliser.]    3. After the water has boiled and steam has been issuing from beneath  the lid for at least ten minutes, extinguish the gas, open the lid, and  lift out the wire basket by its handles and rest it diagonally on the  walls of the steriliser; the contained instruments, etc., are now  sterile and ready for use.    4. After use, or when accidentally contaminated, replace the instruments  in the basket and return that to the steriliser; completely disinfect by  a further"]]]
