The earliest condition in which the mushroom can be  recognized as a vegetable entity is in that of the \"spawn\" or  mycelium, which is essentially an agglomeration of vegetating spores.  Its normal form is that of branched, slender, entangled, anastomosing,  hyaline threads. At certain privileged points of the mycelium, the  threads seem to be aggregated, and become centres of vertical  extension. At first only a small nearly globose budding, like a grain  of mustard seed, is visible, but this afterwards increases rapidly,  and other similar buddings or swellings appear at the base.[A] These  are the young hymenophore. As it pushes through the soil, it  gradually loses its globose form, becomes more or less elongated, and  in this condition a longitudinal section shows the position of the  future gills in a pair of opposite crescent-shaped darker-coloured  spots near the apex. The dermal membrane, or outer skin, seems to be  continuous over the stem and the globose head. At present, there is no  external evidence of an expanded pileus and gills; a longitudinal  section at this stage shows that the gills are being developed, that  the pileus is assuming its cap-like form, that the membrane stretching  from the stem to the edge of the young pileus is separating from the  edge of the gills, and forming a _veil_, which, in course of time,  will separate below and leave the gills exposed. When, therefore, the  mushroom has arrived almost at maturity, the pileus expands, and in  this act the veil is torn away from the margin of the cap, and remains  for a time like a collar around the stem. Fragments of the veil often  remain attached to the margin of the pileus, and the collar adherent  to the stem falls back, and thenceforth is known as the _annulus_ or  ring. We have in this stage the fully-developed hymenophore,--the stem  with its ring, supporting an expanded cap or pileus, with gills on the  under surface bearing the hymenium.[B] A longitudinal section cut  through the pileus and down the stem, gives the best notion of the  arrangement of the parts, and their relation to the whole. By this  means it will be seen that the pileus is continuous with the stem,  that the substance of the pileus descends into the gills, and that  relatively the substance of the stem is more fibrous than that of the  pileus. In the common mushroom the ring is very distinct surrounding  the stem, a little above the middle, like a collar. In some Agarics  the ring is very fugacious, or absent altogether. The form of the  gills, their mode of attachment to the stem, their colour, and more  especially the colour of the spores, are all very important features  to be attended to in the discrimination of species, since they vary in  different species. The whole substance of the Agaric is cellular. A  longitudinal slice from the stem will exhibit under the microscope  delicate tubular cells, the general direction of which is lengthwise,  with lateral branches, the whole interlacing so intimately that it is  difficult to trace any individual thread very far in its course. It  will be evident that the structure is less compact as it approaches  the centre of the stem, which in many species is hollow. The  _hymenium_ is the spore-bearing surface, which is exposed or naked,  and spread over the gills. These plates are covered on all sides with  a delicate membrane, upon which the reproductive organs are developed.  If it were possible to remove this membrane in one entire piece and  spread it out flat, it would cover an immense surface, as compared  with the size of the pileus, for it is plaited or folded like a lady's  fan over the whole of the gill-plates, or lamellae, of the fungus.[C]  If the stem of a mushroom be cut off close to the gills, and the cap  laid upon a sheet of paper, with the gills downwards, and left there  for a few hours, when removed a number of dark radiating lines will be  deposited upon the paper, each line corresponding with the interstices  between one pair of gills. These lines are made up of spores which  have fallen from the hymenium, and, if placed under the microscope,  their character will at once be made evident. If a fragment of the  hymenium be also submitted to a similar examination, it will be found  that the whole surface is studded with spores. The first peculiarity  which will be observed is, that these spores are almost uniformly in  groups of four together. The next feature to be observed is, that each  spore is borne upon a slender stalk or sterigma, and that four of  these sterigmata proceed from the apex of a thicker projection, from  the hymenium, called a _basidium_, each basidium being the supporter  of four sterigmata, and each sterigma of a spore.[D] A closer  examination of the hymenium will reveal the fact that the basidia are  accompanied by other bodies, often larger, but without sterigmata or  spores; these have been termed _cystidia_, and their structure and  functions have been the subject of much controversy.[E] Both kinds of  bodies are produced on the hymenium of most, if not all, the  Agaricini.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Section of Common Mushroom.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--_a._ Sterile cells. _b._ Basidia. _c._ Cystidium.  From _Gomphidius_ (de Seynes).]    The basidia are usually expanded upwards, so as to have more or less  of a clavate form, surmounted by four slender points, or tubular  processes, each supporting a spore; the contents of these cells are  granular, mixed apparently with oleaginous particles, which  communicate through the slender tubes of the spicules with the  interior of the spores. Corda states that, although only one spore is  produced at a time on each sporophore, when this falls away others are  produced in succession for a limited period. As the spores approach  maturity, the connection between their contents and the contents of  the basidia diminishes and ultimately ceases. When the basidium which  bears mature spores is still well charged with granular matter, it may  be presumed that the production of a second or third series of spores  is quite possible. Basidia exhausted entirely of their contents, and  which have become quite hyaline, may often be observed.    The cystidia are usually larger than the basidia, varying in size and  form in different species. They present the appearance of large  sterile cells, attenuated upwards, sometimes into a slender neck.  Corda was of opinion that these were male organs, and gave them the  name of _pollinaires_. Hoffmann has also described[F] both these  organs under the names of _pollinaria_ and _spermatia_, but does not  appear to recognize in them the sexual elements which those names  would indicate; whilst de Seynes suggests that the cystidia are only  organs returned to vegetative functions by a sort of hypertrophy of  the basidia.[G] This view seems to be supported by the fact that, in  the section _Pluteus_ and some others, the cystidia are surmounted by  short horns resembling sterigmata. Hoffmann has also indicated[H] the  passage of cystidia into basidia. The evidence seems to be in favour  of regarding the cystidia as barren conditions of basidia. There are  to be found upon the hymenium of Agarics a third kind of elongated  cells, called by Corda[I] basilary cells, and by Hoffmann \"sterile  cells,\" which are either equal in size or smaller than the basidia,  with which also their structure agrees, excepting in the development  of spicules. These are the \"proper cells of the hymenium\" of Leveille,  and are simply the terminal cells of the gill structure--cells which,  under vigorous conditions, might be developed into basidia, but which  are commonly arrested in their development. As suggested by de Seynes,  the hymenium seems to be reduced to great simplicity, \"one sole and  self-same organ is the basis of it; according as it experiences an  arrest of development, as it grows and fructifies, or as it becomes  hypertrophied, it gives us a paraphyse, a basidium, or a cystidium--in  other terms, atrophied basidium, normal basidium and hypertrophied  basidium; these are the three elements which form the hymenium.\"[J]    The only reproductive organs hitherto demonstrated in Agarics are the  spores, or, as sometimes called, from their method of production,  _basidiospores_.[K] These are at first colourless, but afterwards  acquire the colour peculiar to the species. In size and form they are,  within certain limits, exceedingly variable, although form and size  are tolerably constant in the same species. At first all are globose;  as they mature, the majority are ovoid or elliptic; some are fusiform,  with regularly attenuated extremities. In _Hygrophorus_ they are  rather irregular, reniform, or compressed in the middle. Sometimes the  external surface is rough with more or less projecting warts. Some  mycologists are of opinion that the covering of the spore is double,  consisting of an _exospore_ and an _endospore_, the latter being very  fine and delicate. In other orders the double coating of the spore has  been demonstrated. When the spore is coloured, the external membrane  alone appears to possess colour, the endospore being constantly  hyaline. It may be added here, that in this order the spore is simple  and unicellular. In _Lactarius_ and _Russula_ the trama, or inner  substance, is vesicular. True latex vessels occur occasionally in  _Agaricus_, though not filled with milk as in _Lactarius_.

Their unselfish,  faithful, and successful record demanded something more than the mere  sending of money. It deserved the thanks of the Red Cross organization  in the best and highest manner in which they could be bestowed; it was  decided that its President, in person, should most fittingly do this,  and I accordingly left Washington on the morning of November 22d in  company with Dr. Hubbell, field agent, for Camp Perry, the quarantine  station of Florida. Two days and one night by rail, a few miles across  country by wagon, where trains were forbidden to stop, and another mile  or so over the trestles of St. Mary's on a dirt car with the workmen,  brought us into camp as the evening fires were lighted and the bugle  sounded supper. The genial surgeon in charge, Dr. Hutton, who carried a  knapsack and musket in an Illinois regiment in '62, met us cordially and  extended every possible hospitality. Soon there filed past us to supper  the tall doctor and his little flock; some light and fair-skinned, with  the easy step of a well-bred lady, others dark and bony-handed, but the  strong, kind faces below the turbans told at a glance that you could  trust your life there and find it again. They were not disturbed that  night, and no certain information of our arrival got among them. It was  cold and windy, and the evening short, as nine o'clock brought taps and  lights out. In spite of all caution the news of our coming had spread  over the surrounding country, and telegrams bringing both thanks for  what had been received and the needs for more, came from all sides, and  the good Mayor of Macclenny made his troubled way to reach and greet us  in person, and take again the faithful hands that had served and saved  his people.    Surgeon Hutton's headquarter tent was politely tendered for the first  meeting, and as one could never, while memory lasts, forget this scene,  so no words can ever adequately describe it. The ample tent was filled.  Here on the right the Mayor, broad shouldered, kind faced and efficient,  officers of camp, and many visitors, wondering what it all meant; in the  center the tall doctor and his faithful band--Eliza Lanier, Lena Seymour  (mother and daughter), Elizabeth Eastman, Harriet Schmidt, Lizzie Louis,  Rebecca Vidal, Annie Evans, Arthur Duteil, Frederick Wilson, and Edward  Holyland.    I give these names because they are worthy a place in the history of any  epidemic; but no country, race, nor creed could claim them as a body:  four Americans, one German, one French, one Irish, three Africans, part  Protestant, and part Catholic, but all from New Orleans, of grand old  _Howard_ stock, from Memphis down, nursing in every epidemic from the  bayous of the Mississippi to Tampa Bay; and hereafter we will know them  as the \"_Old Guard_.\"    Here, in the winds of approaching winter they stand in the light garb of  early September in New Orleans, thin, worn, longing for home, but  patient, grateful, and glad, some trifling \"nubia\" or turban about the  head, but only one distinguishing feature in common. A pitiful little  misshapen Red Cross, made by their own hands, of two bits of scarlet  ribbon, soiled, fringed, and tattered, pinned closely upon the left  breast of each, strove in mute appeal to say who they were, and what  they served. A friendly recognition and some words of thanks from their  President, opened the way for those anxious to follow. The rich, warm  eloquence of Mayor Watkins plainly told from how near his heart the  stream of gratitude was flowing, and his manly voice trembled as he  reverted to the condition of his stricken people, on that pitiless  night, when this little band of pilgrim strangers strayed back to them  in the rain and darkness. \"I fear they often worked in hunger,\" he said,  \"for then, as now, we had little for ourselves, our sick, or our well;  but they brought us to our feet, and the blessing of every man, woman,  and child in Macclenny is on them.\"    It was with a kind of paternal pride that Dr. Gill advanced and placed  before us his matchless record of cases attended, and life preserved.  \"This is the record of our work,\" he said. \"I am proud of it, and glad  that I have been able to make it, but without the best efforts of these  faithful nurses I could not have done it; they have stood firm through  everything; not a word of complaint from, nor of, one of them, in all  these trying months, and I thank you, our President, for this  opportunity to testify to their merits in your presence.\" The full cups  overflowed, and as we took each brown calloused hand in ours, and felt  the warm tears dropping over them, we realized how far from calloused  were the hearts behind them. The silence that followed was a season of  prayer.    Then came opportunity for some conversation, questions, and  explanations. \"We wish to introduce to our President our chief nurse,  whom Colonel Southmayd placed in charge of us when we left the car, and  directed us to obey him; he is younger than any of us, Ed. Holyland.\" A  slight young man with clear, olive complexion, and dark-browed earnest  eyes that looked you straight in the face, came forward; his apparent  youthfulness gave rise to the first remark:    \"How old are you, Mr. Holyland?\"    \"Twenty-nine, madam.\"    \"And you have taken charge of these nurses?\"    \"I have done what I could for their comfort; I think that was what the  colonel desired; he knew they would need only care and advice, they  would do their best of themselves. During the few days that Colonel  Southmayd remained in Jacksonville,\" he continued, \"he was able to send  us some such comforts as we needed for the sick, and some nourishing  food for ourselves; but this was only a few days, you know, and after  that we got on as well as we could without. I know that after he left  the nurses gave to the sick, the children, the old and the helpless,  what they needed for their own strength.\"    \"But you did not tell us this, Mr. Holyland.\"    \"No, we were dazed and frightened by the things we heard. We felt that  your organization was having enough to bear. We knew we must look to  you for our pay, and we thought, under the circumstances, that would be  your share. But permit me, please, to call your attention to Mr. Wilson  (a stout colored man advanced), who took charge of a little hospital of  six cases, and carried them all through, day and night, without an  hour's relief from any person, and never lost a single case.\"    \"And permit me,\" chimed in the clear-toned Irish voice of Lizzie Louis,  \"to tell of Mr. Holyland himself, who found a neglected Italian family a  mile or more outside of the town. He went and nursed them alone, and  when the young son, a lad of thirteen or fourteen years, died, knowing  there was no one to bury him there, he wrapped him in a blanket and  brought him into town on his back, for burial.\"    Holyland's face grew sad, and his eyes modestly sought the floor, as he  listened to this unexpected revelation.    \"I wish to speak of something else,\" added one of the men, \"which we  were held back from doing, and for which we are now very glad. We should  not have thought of it ourselves. It is customary,\" he continued, \"when  a patient dies in an epidemic, to give the nurse ten dollars for  preparing the body for burial; this was done in our first case, but Mr.  Holyland had the gift promptly returned with thanks, and the explanation  that we were employed by an organization which fully rewarded its  nurses, and was too high and too correct to accept tribute for  misfortune; it was enough that the patient was lost.\"    By this time poor black Annie Evans, the \"Mammy\" of the group, could  hold quiet no longer, and broke silence with, \"Missus President! whar is  de colonel? Colonel Southmayd; dey tells me all de time he's gone away  from New Orleans, and I can't b'l'eve 'em. He can't go away; he can't  lib anywhar else, he was always dar. I'se nursed in yellow fever and  cholera more'n twenty-five year, and I neber went for nobody but him; it  arn't no New Orleans for us widout him dar. I doesn't know de name of  dat place dey say he's gone to, and I doesn't want to; he'll be in New  Orleans when we gets dar.\"    There were pitying glances among the group, at this little burst of  feeling, for in some way it was an echo of their own; and Lena Seymour  added tenderly: \"We have been trying for these two months to convince  Mammy about this, but she is firm in her faith and sometimes refuses to  hear us.\" But the subject changed with \"How many cases did you lose in  this epidemic, Mammy?\"    \"I didn't lose no cases! Lor' bless you, honey, I doesn't lose cases if  dey hasn't been killed afore dey gets to me; folks needn't die of yellow  fever.\"    We didn't suppose that \"Mammy\" intended any reflection upon the medical  fraternity.    \"But now, friends, we must turn to our settlement, which can not be  difficult. Three dollars a day for each nurse, for seventy-nine days,  till you are home on Thanksgiving morning. But here are only ten. There  are eighteen on our list who left with you and Colonel Southmayd; where  are your comrades?\" Some eyes flashed and some moistened, as they  answered, \"We do not know.\" \"They remained in the car that night, and  went on to Jacksonville.\" Swift, dark glances swept from one to another  among them. Instinctively they drew closer to each other, and over  knitted brows and firmly set teeth, a silence fell dark and ominous  like a pall, which the future alone can lift.    The bugle sounded dinner, and this ended our little camp-meeting, than  which few camp-meetings, we believe, ever came nearer to the heart of  Him who offered His life a ransom, and went about doing good.    The winds blew cold across the camp; the fires shot out long angry  tongues of flame and drifts of smoke to every passer-by. The norther was  upon us. Night came down, and all were glad of shelter and sleep. The  morning, "]]]
