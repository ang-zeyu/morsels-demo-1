There was  one convulsive twist, and the gay-coloured fins lay still, the silver  and vermilion body hung limp from the captor's jaws.    For many days thereafter, Golden Pool lay empty under its dropping  crimson and purple leaves, its slow sailing foam flakes. Then, by twos  and threes, small trout strayed in, and found the new region a good  place to inhabit. When, in the following spring, the fishermen came  back to the Clearwater, they reported the pool swarming with pan-fish,  hardly big enough to make it worth while throwing a fly. Then word  went up and down the Clearwater that the master of the pool was gone,  and the glory of the pool, for that generation of fishermen, went with  him.          [Illustration: \"HE WOULD SIT BACK AND WHINE FOR HIS MOTHER.\"]    The Return to the Trails      Down from the rocky den under the bald peak of Sugar Loaf, the old  black bear led her cub. Turning her head every moment to see that he  was close at her heels, she encouraged him with soft, half-whining,  half-grunting sounds, that would have been ridiculous in so huge a  beast had they been addressed to anything less obviously a baby than  this small, velvet-dark, wondering-eyed cub.    Very carefully the old bear chose her path, and very slowly she moved.  But for all her care, she had to stop every minute or two, and  sometimes even turn back a few paces, for the cub was continually  dropping behind. His big, inquiring ears took in all the vague, small  noises of the mountainside, puzzling over them. His sharp little nose  went poking in every direction, sniffing the strange new smells, till  he would get bewildered, and forget which foot to put forward first.  Then he would sit back and whine for his mother.    It was the cub's first adventure, this journey down the world outside  his den. Hitherto he had but played about his doorway.    When the little fellow had somewhat recovered from his first  bewilderment, the old bear moved more rapidly, leading him toward a  swampy, grassy pocket, where she thought there might be roots to dig.  The way was steep, winding down between rocks and stunted trees and  tangles of thick shrubbery, with here and there a black-green spur of  the fir forests thrust up tentatively from the lower slopes. Now and  again it led across a naked shoulder of the mountain, revealing, far  down, a landscape of dark, wide stretching, bluish woods, with  desolate, glimmering lakes strung on a thread of winding river. When  these vast spaces of emptiness opened suddenly upon his baby eyes, the  cub whimpered and drew closer to his mother. The swimming deeps of air  daunted him.    Presently, as the two continued their slow journey, the mother bear's  nostrils caught a new savour. She stopped, lifted her snout, and  tested the wind discriminatingly. It was a smell she had encountered  once before, coming from the door of a lumber camp. Well she  remembered the deliciousness of the lump of fat bacon which she had  succeeded in purloining while the cook was out getting water. Her  thin, red tongue licked her lips at that memory, and, without  hesitation, she turned up the side trail whence came the luring scent.  The cub had to stir his little legs to keep pace with her, but he felt  that something interesting was in the wind, and did his best.    A turn around a thick clump of juniper, and there was the source of  the savour. It looked pleasantly familiar to the old bear, that lump  of fat bacon. It was stuck on the end of a pointed stick, just under a  sort of slanting roof of logs, which, in a way, reminded her of the  lumbermen's cabin. The cabin had done her no harm, and she inferred  that the structure before her was equally harmless. Nevertheless, the  man smell, not quite overpowered by the fragrance of the bacon, lurked  about it; and all the works of man she viewed with suspicion. She  snatched hastily at the prize, turning to jump away even as she did  so.    But the bacon seemed to be fastened to the stick. She gave it an  impatient pull,--and it yielded suddenly. At that same instant, while  her eyes twinkled with elation, that roof of massive logs came  crashing down.    It fell across her back. Weighted as it was with heavy stones, it  crushed the life out of her in a second. There was a coughing gasp,  cut off abruptly; and the flattened form lay still, the wide-open  mouth and protruding tongue jammed down among the mosses. At the crash  the cub had jumped back in terror. Then he sat up on his haunches and  looked on with anxious bewilderment.           *       *       *       *       *    When, early the following morning, the Indian who had set the deadfall  came, he found the cub near perishing with cold and fear and hunger.  He knew that the little animal would be worth several bearskins, so he  warmed it, wrapped it in his jacket, and took it home to his cabin.  Fed and sheltered, it turned to its captor as a rescuer, and acquired  a perilous faith in the friendliness of man. In fact, it speedily  learned to follow the Indian about the cabin, and to fret for him in  his absence.    That same autumn the Indian took the cub into Edmundston and sold him  for a price that well repaid his pains; and thence, within three or  four months, and by as many transfers, the little animal found his way  into the possession of a travelling circus. Being good-natured and  teachable, and inclined, through his first misunderstanding of the  situation which had robbed him of his mother, to regard mankind as  universally beneficent, he was selected to become a trick bear. In the  course of his training for this honour, he learned that his trainer,  at least, was not wholly beneficent, and toward him he developed a  cordial bitterness, which grew with his years. But he learned his  lessons, nevertheless, and became a star of the ring; and for the  manager of the show, who always kept peanuts or gingerbread in pocket  for him, he conceived such a warmth of regard as he had hitherto  strictly reserved for the Indian.    Valued and well cared for, he grew to a magnificent stature, and up to  the middle of his fifth year he never knew what his life was missing.  To be sure, it was exasperatingly monotonous, this being rolled about  the world in stuffy, swaying cage-cars, and dancing in the ring, and  playing foolish tricks with a red-and-white clown, and being stared at  by hot, applauding, fluttering tiers of people, who looked exactly the  same at every place he came to. His memory of that first walk down the  mountain, at his great mother's heels, had been laid to sleep at the  back of his curiously occupied brain. He had no understanding of the  fierce restlessness, the vague longing, which from time to time, and  especially when the autumn frosts began to nip and tingle, would take  possession of him, moving him almost to hatred of even his special  friends, the manager and the clown.    One vaporous, golden afternoon in early autumn, the circus drew into  the little town of Edmundston, at the mouth of the Madawaska River.  When the noise of the train stopped, the soft roar of the Little Falls  grew audible,--a voice at which all the weary animals pricked their  ears, they knew not, most of them, why. But when the cars and cages  were run out into the fields, where the tents were to be raised, there  drew down from spruce-clad hills a faint fragrance which thrilled the  bear's nostrils, and stirred formless longings in his heart, and made  his ears deaf to the wild music of the falls. That fragrance,  imperceptible to nostrils less sensitive than his, was the breath of  his native wilderness, a message from the sombre solitudes of the  Squatook. He did not know that the lonely peak of Sugar Loaf was but  thirty or forty miles away. He knew only that something, in the air  and in his blood, was calling him to his own.    The bear--well-taught, well-mannered, well-content--was not regarded  as even remembering freedom, let alone desiring it. His fetters,  therefore, were at times little more than nominal, and he was never  very closely watched. Just on the edge of evening, when the dusk was  creeping up the valley and honey-scents from the fields mixed with the  tang of the dark spruce forests, his opportunity came. His trainer had  unhitched the chain from his collar and stooped over it to examine  some defect in the clasp.    At this instant that surge of impulse which, when it does come,  shatters routine and habit to bits, seized the bear. Without  premeditation, he dealt the trainer a cuff that knocked him clean over  a wagon-pole and broke his arm. Before any of the other attendants  could realize what had happened, the bear was beyond the circle of  wagons, and half-way across the buckwheat-fields. In ten minutes more  he was in the spicy glooms of the spruce-woods.    His years of association with men had given the bear a great  confidence in their resources. He was too crafty, therefore, to  slacken his efforts just because he had gained the longed-for woods.  He pressed on doggedly, at a shambling, loose-jointed, but very  effective run, till it was full night and the stars came out sharply  in the patches of clear, dark sky above the tree-tops. In the friendly  dark he halted to strip the sweet but insipid fruit of an Indian  pear, which for a little assuaged his appetite. Then he rushed  on,--perhaps aimlessly, as far as conscious purpose was concerned,  but, in reality, by a sure instinct, making toward his ancestral  steeps of Sugar Loaf.    All night he travelled; and in the steely chill of dawn he came out  upon a spacious lake. The night had been windless, and now, in the  first of the coming light, the water was smooth like blue-black oil  under innumerable writhing wisps and streamers of mist. A keen smell,  raw but sweet, rose from the wet shores, the wet spruce and fir woods,  and the fringe of a deep cedar swamp near by. The tired animal sniffed  it with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25731"],[0,"Ancient Egyptian and Greek Looms (#6)"],[1,"the specimens to  Bankfield Museum; Nos. 3 to 8 are from the old Meyer collection in the  Liverpool Museum (unfortunately the origin of them is unknown); and  those marked 9 to 15 were taken from a mummy of the XXVI. Dynasty,  brought to this country by Lord Denbigh, and now also in the Liverpool  Museum.    A.--Specimens of Mummy cloths from Theban Tombs date about B.C. 1400,  presented by Dr. Wallis-Budge.        1. A plain \"one-up-and-one-down\" linen cloth. The yarns      in this example are more irregular in diameter than      usual--the warp strands varying from 1/25\"th to 1/71\"st      (1 mm. to .2/8 mm.) The warp has about half its strands      doubled (that is twined together), whereas the weft has      only about one in twenty doubled. See Fig. 26.        2. This is a coarser fabric, has been dyed with      saffron, and is somewhat brittle to tease out the      fibres. Both these cloths had evidently absorbed some of      the gums or balsams used in the process of embalming,      and hence the difficulty of separating the fibres for      identification is increased. The structure of the fabric      is peculiar, and, indeed, the only instance I have seen      in Egyptian cloths. A portion, near the middle of the      piece sent, has the warp strands in pairs parallel to      each other, a few of them being double yarns, while all      the remainder are doubled. Of the weft, nearly half are      double yarns. See Fig. 27.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Magnified 10 diameters.]    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Magnified 10 diameters, showing the warp yarn  in pairs.]    B.--Specimens from the Meyer Collection, marked No. 11088. (Date of  acquisition about 1856; date and place of origin unknown).        3. This is a beautifully soft, fine _Wool_ fabric,      containing no size or balsam. From the fineness of the      yarn and of the individual fibres I have no doubt that      the wool has been imported from India, or, more likely,      that the cloth was made in Cashmere. The texture is a      plain weave, has a selvedge edge, the warp yarns are      doubled, while the weft is single yarn. It is much to be      regretted that the particulars of locality, of burial,      and the period of time to which this interesting fabric      belongs has been lost. I assume from the general      characteristics that it is of a late period--probably      not earlier than the Ptolemaic.        4. This linen cloth has a plain selvedge, regular weave,      and contains no size. About 25% of both warp and weft      yarns are doubled, and all are very even in diameter.        5. A coarse linen cloth with plain selvedge. All the      yarns are single and even in diameter.        6. This is a coarse, highly-sized linen cloth. The yarns      are agglutinated, are brittle, and it is difficult to      separate the fibres. The sample submitted has been cut      from the end of the piece and shows the warp ends.        7. A coarse linen cloth, sized and brittle. No selvedge      on the piece sent. Both warp and weft yarns are single,      and even in diameter.        8. This is a very coarse linen fabric heavily sized and      brittle. Both warp and weft yarns are single and very      irregular in diameter.    C.--Lord Denbigh's: XXVI. Dynasty.        9. A soft-spun linen cloth containing no size. Specimen      has been cut from the body of the fabric, showing no      selvedge. About half of the warp is composed of doubled      yarns of irregular diameter; the weft is of doubled      yarns and more regular in diameter.        10. The selvedge of this linen fabric is peculiar and      somewhat elaborate. The outer margin is composed of four      sets of ten yarns parallel to each other, forming one      strand of warp; then comes a space of 1-9/10\" (48 mm.)      where the warp yarns are dyed red; then occurs three      more sets of ten parallel yarns (the object being to      strengthen the selvedge), followed by the general body      of the fabric. The entire selvedge is 2-1/4\" (57 mm.)      wide. About half the warp yarns are doubled, while all      the weft are composed of doubled yarns, both being      fairly even in diameter, and not sized.        11. A fine, soft, linen cloth, with selvedge 1-1/8\" (29      mm.) wide; the three outer and the two inner strands of      the warp are made up of many parallel yarns, as in No.      10, with an interspace of 3/8\" (10 mm.) All the warp      yarns are dyed red, about 25% of them being doubled; the      weft is peculiar in having five or six strands of single      yarns alternating with six or seven double yarns, giving      a faint stripe in the fabric.        12. A linen cloth, with no selvedge edge. It has been      dyed red, probably _ferum_, a dye which I find uniformly      associated with friable or decomposing fibres.        13. A peculiarly coloured fine linen cloth; the pattern      is caused by some of the warp yarns being dyed, and      occurring sometimes of four, two, or one red strands,      with grey ones intermixed. A few of the warp yarns are      doubled. The weft is composed of single yarns and are      all in the grey.        14. A coarse soft-woven linen fabric, containing no      size. Lines are indicated at irregular distances along      the cloth, varying from 5/16\" to 9/16\" (8 to 14 mm.);      these are caused by the introduction of three strands of      doubled yarn in the warp while the remainder are single      yarns. The weft is all of doubled yarns; both warp and      weft are very regular in diameter.        15. This is a variegated linen fabric with warps      coloured something like No. 13, but the red strands of      warp are more irregular in distribution. Like it, a few      of the warp yarns are doubled, both the red and the      grey; while the weft is all of single yarns and in the      grey.\"    [A considerable quantity of specimens of the cloths which were woven  by the Ancient Egyptians has been examined both in this country and  abroad.
