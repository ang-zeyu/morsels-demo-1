As with the horse, I have not acquired any distinct evidence  that the crossing of differently-coloured varieties of the ass brings out the  stripes.    But now let us turn to the result of crossing the horse and ass. Although  mules are not nearly so numerous in England as asses, I have seen a much  greater number with striped legs, and with the stripes far more conspicuous  than in either parent-form. Such mules are generally light-coloured, and might  be called fallow-duns. The shoulder-stripe in one instance was deeply forked  at the extremity, and in another instance was double, though united in the  middle. Mr. Martin gives a figure of a Spanish mule with strong zebra-like  marks on its legs (13/31. 'History of the Horse' page 212.), and remarks that  mules are particularly liable to be thus striped on their legs. In South  America, according to Roulin (13/32. 'Mem. presentes par divers Savans a  l'Acad. Royale' tome 6 1835 page 338.), such stripes are more frequent and  conspicuous in the mule than in the ass. In the United States, Mr. Gosse  (13/33. 'Letters from Alabama' 1859 page 280.), speaking of these animals,  says, \"that in a great number, perhaps in nine out of every ten, the legs are  banded with transverse dark stripes.\"    Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid, from a  bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra. This animal when old  had hardly any stripes; but I was assured by the superintendent, that when  young it had shoulder-stripes, and faint stripes on its flanks and legs. I  mention this case more especially as an instance of the stripes being much  plainer during youth than in old age.    As the zebra has such a conspicuously striped body and legs, it might have  been expected that the hybrids from this animal and the common ass would have  had their legs in some degree striped; but it appears from the figures given  in Dr. Gray's 'Knowsley Gleanings' and still more plainly from that given by  Geoffroy and F. Cuvier (13/34. 'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' 1820 tome 1), that  the legs are much more conspicuously striped than the rest of the body; and  this fact is intelligible only on the belief that the ass aids in giving,  through the power of reversion, this character to its hybrid offspring.    The quagga is banded over the whole front part of its body like a zebra, but  has no stripes on its legs, or mere traces of them. But in the famous hybrid  bred by Lord Morton (13/35. 'Philosoph. Transact.' 1821 page 20.) from a  chestnut, nearly purely-bred, Arabian mare, by a male quagga, the stripes were  \"more strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of \"the quagga.\" The  mare was subsequently put to a black Arabian horse, and bore two colts, both  of which, as formerly stated, were plainly striped on the legs, and one of  them likewise had stripes on the neck and body.    The Equus indicus (13/36. Sclater in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page 163: this  species is the Ghor-Khur of N.W. India, and has often been called the Hemionus  of Pallas. See also Mr. Blyth's excellent paper in 'Journal of Asiatic Soc. of  Bengal' volume 28 1860 page 229.) is characterised by a spinal stripe, without  shoulder or leg stripes; but traces of these latter stripes may occasionally  be seen even in the adult (13/37. Another species of wild ass, the true E.  hemionus or Kiang, which ordinarily has no shoulder-stripes, is said  occasionally to have them; and these, as with the horse and ass, are sometimes  double: see Mr. Blyth in the paper just quoted and in 'Indian Sporting Review'  1856 page 320: and Col. Hamilton Smith in 'Nat. Library, Horses' page 318; and  'Dict. Class. d'Hist. Nat.' tome 3 page 563.) and Colonel S. Poole, who has  had ample opportunities for observation, informs me that in the foal, when  first born, the head and legs are often striped, but the shoulder-stripe is  not so distinct as in the domestic ass; all these stripes, excepting that  along the spine, soon disappear. Now a hybrid, raised at Knowsley (13/38.  Figured in the 'Gleanings from the Knowsley Menageries' by Dr. J.E. Gray.)  from a female of this species by a male domestic ass, had all four legs  transversely and conspicuously striped, had three short stripes on each  shoulder and had even some zebra-like stripes on its face! Dr. Gray informs me  that he has seen a second hybrid of the same parentage, similarly striped.    From these facts we see that the crossing of the several equine species tends  in a marked manner to cause stripes to appear on various parts of the body,  especially on the legs. As we do not know whether the parent-form of the genus  was striped, the appearance of the stripes can only hypothetically be  attributed to reversion. But most persons, after considering the many  undoubted cases of variously coloured marks reappearing by reversion in my  experiments on crossed pigeons and fowls, will come to the same conclusion  with respect to the horse-genus; and if so, we must admit that the progenitor  of the group was striped on the legs, shoulders, face, and probably over the  whole body, like a zebra.    Lastly, Professor Jaeger has given (13/39. 'Darwin'sche Theorie und ihre  Stellung zu Moral und Religion' page 85.) a good case with pigs. He crossed  the Japanese or masked breed with the common German breed, and the offspring  were intermediate in character. He then re-crossed one of these mongrels with  the pure Japanese, and in the litter thus produced one of the young resembled  in all its characters a wild pig; it had a long snout and upright ears, and  was striped on the back. It should be borne in mind that the young of the  Japanese breed are not striped, and that they have a short muzzle and ears  remarkably dependent.]    A similar tendency to the recovery of long lost characters holds good even  with the instincts of crossed animals. There are some breeds of fowls which  are called \"everlasting layers,\" because they have lost the instinct of  incubation; and so rare is it for them to incubate that I have seen notices  published in works on poultry, when hens of such breeds have taken to sit.  (13/40. Cases of both Spanish and Polish hens sitting are given in the  'Poultry Chronicle' 1855 volume 3 page 477.) Yet the aboriginal species was of  course a good incubator; and with birds in a state of nature hardly any  instinct is so strong as this. Now, so many cases have been recorded of the  crossed offspring from two races, neither of which are incubators, becoming  first-rate sitters, that the reappearance of this instinct must be attributed  to reversion from crossing. One author goes so far as to say, \"that a cross  between two non-sitting varieties almost invariably produces a mongrel that  becomes broody, and sits with remarkable steadiness.\" (13/41. 'The Poultry  Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866 pages 119, 163. The author, who remarks on the  two negatives ('Journ. of Hort.' 1862 page 325), states that two broods were  raised from a Spanish cock and Silver-pencilled Hamburgh hen, neither of which  are incubators, and no less than seven out of eight hens in these two broods  \"showed a perfect obstinacy in sitting.\" The Rev. E.S. Dixon ('Ornamental  Poultry' 1848 page 200) says that chickens reared from a cross between Golden  and Black Polish fowls, are \"good and steady birds to sit.\" Mr. B.P. Brent  informs me that he raised some good sitting hens by crossing Pencilled  Hamburgh and Polish breeds. A cross-bred bird from a Spanish non-incubating  cock and Cochin incubating hen is mentioned in the 'Poultry Chronicle' volume  3 page 13, as an \"exemplary mother.\" On the other hand, an exceptional case is  given in the 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 388 of a hen raised from a Spanish  cock and black Polish hen which did not incubate.) Another author, after  giving a striking example, remarks that the fact can be explained only on the  principle that \"two negatives make a positive.\" It cannot, however, be  maintained that hens produced from a cross between two non-sitting breeds  invariably recover their lost instinct, any more than that crossed fowls or  pigeons invariably recover the red or blue plumage of their prototypes. Thus I  raised several chickens from a Polish hen by a Spanish cock,--breeds which do  not incubate,--and none of the young hens at first showed any tendency to sit;  but one of them--the only one which was preserved--in the third year sat well  on her eggs and reared a brood of chickens. So that here we have the  reappearance with advancing age of a primitive instinct, in the same manner as  we have seen that the red plumage of the Gallus bankiva is sometimes  reacquired both by crossed and purely-bred fowls of various kinds as they grow  old.    The parents of all our domesticated animals were of course aboriginally wild  in disposition; and when a domesticated species is crossed with a distinct  species, whether this is a domesticated or only a tamed animal, the hybrids  are often wild to such a degree, that the fact is intelligible only on the  principle that the cross has caused a partial return to a primitive  disposition. Thus, the Earl of Powis formerly imported some thoroughly  domesticated humped cattle from India, and crossed them with English breeds,  which belong to a distinct species; and his agent remarked to me, without any  question having been asked, how oddly wild the cross-bred animals were. The  European wild boar and the Chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly  specifically distinct: Sir F. Darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a  wild Alpine boar which had become extremely tame, but the young, though having  half-domesticated blood in their veins, were \"extremely wild in confinement,  and would not eat swill like common English pigs.\" Captain Hutton, in India,  crossed a tame goat with a wild one from the Himalaya, and he remarked to me  how"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#6)"],[1,"a third star, of tenth  magnitude, and reddish in color, distance 49\", p. 103 deg.. Close by iota we  find the little double star Sigma 747, whose components are of five and  a half and six and a half magnitudes respectively, and separated 36\", p.  223 deg.. Above the uppermost star in the Sword is a small star cluster, No.  1184, which derives a special interest from the fact that it incloses a  delicate double star, Sigma 750, whose larger component is of the sixth  magnitude, while the smaller is of the ninth, and the distance is only  4.3\", p. 59 deg.. We may try the four-inch on this object.    Having looked at alpha (Betelgeuse), the great topaz star on Orion's  right shoulder, and admired the splendor of its color, we may turn the  four-inch upon the star Sigma 795, frequently referred to by its number  as \"52 Orionis.\" It consists of one star of the sixth and another of  sixth and a half magnitude, only 1.5\" apart, p. 200 deg.. Having separated  them with a power of two hundred and fifty diameters on the four-inch,  we may try them with a high power on the three-inch. We shall only  succeed this time if our glass is of first-rate quality and the air is  perfectly steady.    The star lambda in Orion's head presents an easy conquest for the  three-inch, as it consists of a light-yellow star of magnitude three and  a half and a reddish companion of the sixth magnitude; distance 4\", p.  43 deg.. There is also a twelfth-magnitude star at 27\", p. 183 deg., and a tenth  or eleventh magnitude one at 149\", p. 278 deg.. These are tests for the  five-inch, and we must not be disappointed if we do not succeed in  seeing the smaller one even with that aperture.    Other objects in Orion, to be found with the aid of our map, are: Sigma  627, a double star, magnitude six and a half and seven, distance 21\", p.  260 deg.; Omicron Sigma 98, otherwise named iota Orionis, double, magnitude  six and seven, distance 1\", p. 180 deg., requires five-inch glass; Sigma  652, double, magnitudes six and a half and eight, distance 1.7\", p.  184 deg.; rho, double, magnitudes five and eight and a half, the latter  blue, distance 7\", p. 62 deg., may be tried with a three-inch; tau, triple  star, magnitudes four, ten and a half, and eleven, distances 36\", p.  249 deg., and 36\", p. 60 deg.. Burnham discovered that the ten-and-a-half  magnitude star is again double, distance 4\", p. 50 deg.. There is not much  satisfaction in attempting tau Orionis with telescopes of ordinary  apertures; Sigma 629 otherwise _m_ Orionis, double, magnitudes five and  a half (greenish) and seven, distance 31.7\", p. 28 deg., a pretty object;  Sigma 728, otherwise A 32, double, magnitudes five and seven, distance,  0.5\" or less, p. 206 deg., a rapid binary,[2] which is at present too close  for ordinary telescopes, although it was once within their reach; Sigma  729, double, magnitudes six and eight, distance 2\", p. 26 deg., the smaller  star pale blue--try it with a four-inch, but five-inch is better; Sigma  816, double, magnitudes six and half and eight and a half, distance 4\",  p. 289 deg.; psi 2, double, magnitudes five and a half and eleven, distance  3\", or a little less, p. 322 deg.; 905, star cluster, contains about twenty  stars from the eighth to the eleventh magnitude; 1267, nebula, faint,  containing a triple star of the eighth magnitude, two of whose  components are 51\" apart, while the third is only 1.7\" from its  companion, p. 85 deg.; 1376, star cluster, small and crowded; 1361, star  cluster, triangular shape, containing thirty stars, seventh to tenth  magnitudes, one of which is a double, distance 2.4\".    [2] The term \"binary\" is used to describe double stars which are in  motion about their common center of gravity.    Let us now leave the inviting star-fields of Orion and take a glance at  the little constellation of Lepus, crouching at the feet of the mythical  giant. We may begin with a new kind of object, the celebrated red  variable R Leporis (map No. 1). This star varies from the sixth or  seventh magnitude to magnitude eight and a half in a period of four  hundred and twenty-four days. Hind's picturesque description of its  color has frequently been quoted. He said it is \"of the most intense  crimson, resembling a blood-drop on the black ground of the sky.\" It is  important to remember that this star is reddest when faintest, so that  if we chance to see it near its maximum of brightness it will not  impress us as being crimson at all, but rather a dull, coppery red. Its  spectrum indicates that it is smothered with absorbing vapors, a sun  near extinction which, at intervals, experiences an accession of energy  and bursts through its stifling envelope with explosive radiance, only  to faint and sink once more. It is well to use our largest aperture in  examining this star.    We may also employ the five-inch for an inspection of the double star  iota, whose chief component of the fifth magnitude is beautifully tinged  with green. The smaller companion is very faint, eleventh magnitude, and  the distance is about 13\", p. 337 deg..    Another fine double in Lepus is kappa, to be found just below iota; the  components are of the fifth and eighth magnitudes, pale yellow and blue  respectively, distance 2.5\", p. 360 deg.; the third-magnitude star alpha has  a tenth-magnitude companion at a distance of 35\", p. 156 deg., and its  neighbor beta (map No. 2), according to Burnham, is attended by three  eleventh-magnitude stars, two of which are at distances of 206\", p. 75 deg.,  and 240\", p. 58 deg., respectively, while the third is less than 3\" from  beta, p. 288 deg.; the star gamma (map No. 2) is a wide double, the distance  being 94\", and the magnitudes four and eight. The star numbered 45 is a  remarkable multiple, but the components are too faint to possess much  interest for those who are not armed with very powerful telescopes.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 2.]    From Lepus we pass to Canis Major (map No. 2). There is no hope of our  being able to see the companion of alpha (Sirius), at present (1901),  even with our five-inch. Discovered by Alvan Clark with an eighteen-inch  telescope in 1862, when its distance was 10\" from the center of Sirius,  this ninth-magnitude star has since been swallowed up in the blaze of  its great primary. At first, it slightly increased its distance, and  from 1868 until 1879 most of the measures made by different observers  considerably exceeded 11\". Then it began to close up, and in 1890 the  distance scarcely exceeded 4\". Burnham was the last to catch sight of it  with the Lick telescope in that year. After that no human eye saw it  until 1896, when it was rediscovered at the Lick Observatory. Since  then the distance has gradually increased to nearly 5\". According to  Burnham, its periodic time is about fifty-three years, and its nearest  approach to Sirius should have taken place in the middle of 1892. Later  calculations reduce the periodic time to forty-eight or forty-nine  years. If we can not see the companion of the Dog Star with our  instruments, we can at least, while admiring the splendor of that  dazzling orb, reflect with profit upon the fact that although the  companion is ten thousand times less bright than Sirius, it is half as  massive as its brilliant neighbor. Imagine a subluminous body half as  ponderous as the sun to be set revolving round it somewhere between  Uranus and Neptune. Remember that that body would possess one hundred  and sixty-five thousand times the gravitating energy of the earth, and  that five hundred and twenty Jupiters would be required to equal its  power of attraction, and then consider the consequences to our  easy-going planets! Plainly the solar system is not cut according to the  Sirian fashion. We shall hardly find a more remarkable coupling of  celestial bodies until we come, on another evening, to a star that  began, ages ago, to amaze the thoughtful and inspire the superstitious  with dread--the wonderful Algol in Perseus.    We may remark in passing that Sirius is the brightest representative of  the great spectroscopic type I, which includes more than half of all the  stars yet studied, and which is characterized by a white or bluish-white  color, and a spectrum possessing few or at best faint metallic lines,  but remarkably broad, black, and intense lines of hydrogen. The  inference is that Sirius is surrounded by an enormous atmosphere of  hydrogen, and that the intensity of its radiation is greater, surface  for surface, than that of the sun. There is historical evidence to  support the assertion, improbable in itself, that Sirius, within  eighteen hundred years, has changed color from red to white.    With either of our telescopes we shall have a feast for the eye when we  turn the glass upon the star cluster No. 1454, some four degrees south  of Sirius. Look for a red star near the center. Observe the curving rows  so suggestive of design, or rather of the process by which this cluster  was evolved out of a pre-existing nebula. You will recall the winding  streams in the Great Nebula of Orion. Another star cluster worth a  moment's attention is No. 1479, above and to the left of Sirius. We had  better use the five-inch for this, as many of the stars are very faint.  Not far away we find the double star , whose components are of the fifth  and eighth magnitudes, distance 2.8\", p. 343 deg.. The small star is pale  blue. Cluster No. 1512 is a pleasing object with our largest aperture.  In No. 1511 we have a faint nebula remarkable for the rows of minute  stars in and near it. The star gamma is an irregular variable. In 1670  it is said to have almost disappeared, while at the beginning of the  eighteenth century it was more than twice as bright as it is to-day. The  reddish star delta is also probably variable. In my \"Astronomy with an  Opera Glass\" will be found a cut showing a singular array of small stars  partly encircling delta. These are"]]]
