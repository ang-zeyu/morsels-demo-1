Here he was kindly treated. He saw Indian dances, heard Indian orations.  The women and children pressed about him and admired him greatly. Bread  and venison were given him in such quantity that he feared that they  meant to fatten and eat him. It is, moreover, dangerous to be considered  powerful where one is scarcely so. A young Indian lay mortally ill, and  they took Smith to him and demanded that forthwith he be cured. If the  white man could kill--how they were not able to see--he could likewise  doubtless restore life. But the Indian presently died. His father,  crying out in fury, fell upon the stranger who could have done so much  and would not! Here also coolness saved the white man.    Smith was now led in triumph from town to town through the winter woods.  The James was behind him, the Chickahominy also; he was upon new great  rivers, the Pamunkey and the Rappahannock. All the villages were much  alike, alike the still woods, the sere patches from which the corn had  been taken, the bear, the deer, the foxes, the turkeys that were  met with, the countless wild fowl. Everywhere were the same curious,  crowding savages, the fires, the rustic cookery, the covering skins  of deer and fox and otter, the oratory, the ceremonial dances, the  manipulations of medicine men or priests--these last, to the Englishmen,  pure \"devils with antique tricks.\" Days were consumed in this going from  place to place. At one point was produced a bag of gunpowder, gained  in some way from Jamestown. It was being kept with care to go into the  earth in the spring and produce, when summer came, some wonderful crop.    Opechancanough was a great chief, but higher than he moved Powhatan,  chief of chiefs. This Indian was yet a stranger to the English in  Virginia. Now John Smith was to make his acquaintance.    Werowocomoco stood upon a bluff on the north side of York River. Here  came Smith and his captors, around them the winter woods, before them  the broad blue river. Again the gathered Indians, men and women, again  the staring, the handling, the more or less uncomplimentary remarks;  then into the Indian ceremonial lodge he was pushed. Here sat the chief  of chiefs, Powhatan, and he had on a robe of raccoon skins with all  the tails hanging. About him sat his chief men, and behind these were  gathered women. All were painted, head and shoulders; all wore, bound  about the head, adornments meant to strike with beauty or with terror;  all had chains of beads. Smith does not report what he said to Powhatan,  or Powhatan to him. He says that the Queen of Appamatuck brought him  water for his hands, and that there was made a great feast. When this  was over, the Indians held a council. It ended in a death decree.  Incontinently Smith was seized, dragged to a great stone lying before  Powhatan, forced down and bound. The Indians made ready their clubs;  meaning to batter his brains out. Then, says Smith, occurred the  miracle.    A child of Powhatan's, a very young girl called Pocahontas, sprang from  among the women, ran to the stone, and with her own body sheltered that  of the Englishman....*         * A vast amount of erudition has been expended by historical       students to establish the truth or falsity of this       Pocahontas story. The author has refrained from entering the       controversy, preferring to let the story stand as it was       told by Captain Smith in his \"General History\" (1624).--       Editor.    What, in Powhatan's mind, of hesitation, wiliness, or good nature backed  his daughter's plea is not known. But Smith did not have his brains  beaten out. He was released, taken by some form of adoption into the  tribe, and set to using those same brains in the making of hatchets and  ornaments. A few days passed and he was yet further enlarged. Powhatan  longed for two of the great guns possessed by the white men and for a  grindstone. He would send Smith back to Jamestown if in return he  was sure of getting those treasures. It is to be supposed that Smith  promised him guns and grindstones as many as could be borne away.    So Werowocomoco saw him depart, twelve Indians for escort. He had  leagues to go, a night or two to spend upon the march. Lying in the  huge winter woods, he expected, on the whole, death before morning.  But \"Almighty God mollified the hearts of those sterne barbarians with  compassion.\" And so he was restored to Jamestown, where he found more  dead than when he left. Some there undoubtedly welcomed him as a strong  man restored when there was need of strong men. Others, it seems, would  as lief that Pocahontas had not interfered.    The Indians did not get their guns and grindstones. But Smith loaded a  demi-culverin with stones and fired upon a great tree, icicle-hung. The  gun roared, the boughs broke, the ice fell rattling, the smoke spread,  the Indians cried out and cowered away. Guns and grindstone, Smith told  them, were too violent and heavy devils for them to carry from river to  river. Instead he gave them, from the trading store, gifts enticing to  the savage eye, and not susceptible of being turned against the donors.    Here at Jamestown in midwinter were more food and less mortal sickness  than in the previous fearful summer, yet no great amount of food, and  now suffering, too, from bitter cold. Nor had the sickness ended, nor  dissensions. Less than fifty men were all that held together England  and America--a frayed cord, the last strands of which might presently  part....    Then up the river comes Christopher Newport in the Francis and John, to  be followed some weeks later by the Phoenix. Here is new life--stores  for the settlers and a hundred new Virginians! How certain, at any  rate, is the exchange of talk of home and hair-raising stories of this  wilderness between the old colonists and the new! And certain is  the relief and the renewed hopes. Mourning turns to joy. Even a  conflagration that presently destroys the major part of the town can not  blast that felicity.    Again Newport and Smith and others went out to explore the country. They  went over to Werowocomoco and talked with Powhatan. He told them things  which they construed to mean that the South Sea was near at hand, and  they marked this down as good news for the home Council--still impatient  for gold and Cathay. On their return to Jamestown they found under way  new and stouter houses. The Indians were again friendly; they brought  venison and turkeys and corn. Smith says that every few days came  Pocahontas and attendant women bringing food.    Spring came again with the dogwood and the honeysuckle and the  strawberries, the gay, returning birds, the barred and striped and  mottled serpents. The colony was one year old. Back to England sailed  the Francis and John and the Phoenix, carrying home Edward-Maria  Wingfield, who has wearied of Virginia and will return no more.    What rests certain and praiseworthy in Smith is his thoroughness and  daring in exploration. This summer he went with fourteen others down the  river in an open boat, and so across the great bay, wide as a sea, to  what is yet called the Eastern Shore, the counties now of Accomac and  Northampton. Rounding Cape Charles these indefatigable explorers came  upon islets beaten by the Atlantic surf. These they named Smith's  Islands. Landing upon the main shore, they met \"grimme and stout\"  savages, who took them to the King of Accomac, and him they found civil  enough. This side of the great bay, with every creek and inlet, Smith  examined and set down upon the map he was making. Even if he could find  no gold for the Council at home, at least he would know what places were  suited for \"harbours and habitations.\" Soon a great storm came up, and  they landed again, met yet other Indians, went farther, and were in  straits for fresh water. The weather became worse; they were in danger  of shipwreck--had to bail the boat continually. Indians gathered upon  the shore and discharged flights of arrows, but were dispersed by a  volley from the muskets. The bread the English had with them went bad.  Wind and weather were adverse; three or four of the fifteen fell ill,  but recovered. The weather improved; they came to the seven-mile-wide  mouth of \"Patawomeck\"--the Potomac. They turned their boat up this vast  stream. For a long time they saw upon the woody banks no savages. Then  without warning they came upon ambuscades of great numbers \"so strangely  painted, grimed and disguised, shouting, yelling and crying, as we  rather supposed them so many divils.\" Smith, in midstream, ordered  musket-fire, and the balls went grazing over the water, and the terrible  sound echoed through the woods. The savages threw down their bows and  arrows and made signs of friendliness. The English went ashore, hostages  were exchanged, and a kind of amicableness ensued. After such sylvan  entertainment Smith and his men returned to the boat. The oars dipped  and rose, the bright water broke from them; and these Englishmen in Old  Virginia proceeded up the Potomac. Could they have seen--could they but  have seen before them, on the north bank, rising, like the unsubstantial  fabric of a dream, there above the trees, a vast, white Capitol shining  in the sunlight!    Far up the river, they noticed that the sand on the shore gleamed with  yellow spangles. They looked and saw high rocks, and they thought that  from these the rain had washed the glittering dust. Gold? Harbors they  had found--but what of gold? What, even, of Cathay?    Going down stream, they sought again those friendly Indians. Did they  know gold or silver? The Indians looked wise, nodded heads, and took  the visitors up a little tributary river to a rocky hill in which  \"with shells and hatchets\" they had opened as it were a mine.

As soon as I have got a Patent in America I shall  go with the machine which I am now making, to Georgia, where I shall  stay a few weeks to see it at work. From thence I expect to go to  England, where I shall probably continue two or three years. How  advantageous this business will eventually prove to me, I cannot say. It  is generally said by those who know anything about it, that I shall make  a Fortune by it. I have no expectation that I shall make an independent  fortune by it, but think I had better pursue it than any other business  into which I can enter. Something which cannot be foreseen may frustrate  my expectations and defeat my Plan; but I am now so sure of success that  ten thousand dollars, if I saw the money counted out to me, would not  tempt me to give up my right and relinquish the object. I wish you, sir,  not to show this letter nor communicate anything of its contents to any  body except My Brothers and Sister, ENJOINING it on them to keep the  whole A PROFOUND SECRET.\"         * Then the national capital.         ** Hammond, \"Correspondence of Eli Whitney,\" American       Historical Review, vol. III, p. 99. The other citations in       this chapter are from the same source, unless otherwise       stated.      The invention, however, could not be kept \"a profound secret,\" for  knowledge of it was already out in the cotton country. Whitney's  hostess, Mrs. Greene, had shown the wonderful machine to some friends,  who soon spread the glad tidings, and planters, near and far, had  come to Mulberry Grove to see it. The machine was of very simple  construction; any blacksmith or wheelwright, knowing the principle of  the design, could make one. Even before Whitney could obtain his patent,  cotton gins based on his were being manufactured and used.    Whitney received his patent in March, 1794, and entered on his new  work with enthusiasm. His partner, Phineas Miller, was a cultivated New  England gentleman, a graduate of Yale College, who, like Whitney, had  sought his fortune as a teacher in the South. He had been a tutor in  the Greene household and on General Greene's death had taken over  the management of his estates. He afterwards married Mrs. Greene. The  partners decided to manufacture the machines in New Haven, Whitney  to give his time to the production, Miller to furnish the capital and  attend to the firm's interests in the South.    At the outset the partners blundered seriously in their plan for  commercializing the invention. They planned to buy seed cotton and clean  it themselves; also to clean cotton for the planters on the familiar  toll system, as in grinding grain, taking a toll of one pound of cotton  out of every three. \"Whitney's plan in Georgia,\" says a recent writer,  \"as shown by his letters and other evidence, was to own all the gins and  gin all the cotton made in the country. It is but human nature that this  sort of monopoly should be odious to any community.\"* Miller appears to  have calculated that the planters could afford to pay for the use of the  new invention about one-half of all the profits they derived from its  use. An equal division, between the owners of the invention on the one  hand and the cotton growers on the other, of all the super-added wealth  arising from the invention, seemed to him fair. Apparently the full  meaning of such an arrangement did not enter his mind. Perhaps Miller  and Whitney did not see at first that the new invention would cause a  veritable industrial revolution, or that the system they planned, if it  could be made effective, would make them absolute masters of the cotton  country, with the most stupendous monopoly in the world. Nor do they  appear to have realized that, considering the simple construction of  their machine and the loose operation of the patent law at that time,  the planters of the South would never submit to so great a tribute as  they proposed to exact. Their attempt in the first instance to set up  an unfair monopoly brought them presently into a sea of troubles, which  they never passed out of, even when they afterwards changed their tack  and offered to sell the machines with a license, or a license alone, at  a reasonable price.         * Tompkins, \"Cotton and Cotton Oil\", p. 86.      Misfortune pursued the partners from the beginning. Whitney writes to  his father from New Haven in May, 1794, that his machines in Georgia are  working well, but that he apprehends great difficulty in manufacturing  them as fast as they are needed. In March of the following year he  writes again, saying that his factory in New Haven has been destroyed  by fire: \"When I returned home from N. York I found my property all in  ashes! My shop, all my tools, material and work equal to twenty finished  cotton machines all gone. The manner in which it took fire is altogether  unaccountable.\" Besides, the partners found themselves in distress  for lack of capital. Then word came from England that the Manchester  spinners had found the ginned cotton to contain knots, and this was  sufficient to start the rumor throughout the South that Whitney's gin  injured the cotton fiber and that cotton cleaned by them was worthless.  It was two years before this ghost was laid. Meanwhile Whitney's  patent was being infringed on every hand. \"They continue to clean great  quantities of cotton with Lyon's Gin and sell it advantageously while  the Patent ginned cotton is run down as good for nothing,\" writes Miller  to Whitney in September, 1797. Miller and Whitney brought suits against  the infringers but they could obtain no redress in the courts.    Whitney's attitude of mind during these troubles is shown in his  letters. He says the statement that his machines injure the cotton is  false, that the source of the trouble is bad cotton, which he ventures  to think is improved fifty per cent by the use of his gin, and that  it is absurd to say that the cotton could be injured in any way in the  process of cleaning. \"I think,\" he says, writing to Miller, \"you will  be able to convince the CANDID that this is quite a mistaken notion and  them that WILL NOT BELIEVE may be damn'd.\" Again, writing later to  his friend Josiah Stebbins in New England: \"I have a set of the most  Depraved villains to combat and I might almost as well go to HELL in  search of HAPPINESS as apply to a Georgia Court for Justice.\" And  again: \"You know I always believed in the 'DEPRAVITY OF HUMAN NATURE.'  I thought I was long ago sufficiently 'grounded and stablished' in this  Doctrine. But God Almighty is continually pouring down cataracts of  testimony upon me to convince me of this fact. 'Lord I believe,  help thou,' not 'mine unbelief,' but me to overcome the rascality of  mankind.\" His partner Miller, on the other hand, is inclined to be more  philosophical and suggests to Whitney that \"we take the affairs of this  world patiently and that the little dust which we may stir up about  cotton may after all not make much difference with our successors one  hundred, much less one thousand years hence.\" Miller, however, finally  concluded that, \"the prospect of making anything by ginning in this  State [Georgia] is at an end. Surreptitious gins are being erected in  every part of the country; and the jurymen at Augusta have come to an  understanding among themselves, that they will never give a verdict in  our favor, let the merits of the case be as they may.\"*         * Cited in Roe, \"English and American Tool Builders\", p.       153.      Miller and Whitney were somewhat more fortunate in other States than  in Georgia though they nowhere received from the cotton gin enough to  compensate them for their time and trouble nor more than a pitiable  fraction of the great value of their invention. South Carolina, in  1801, voted them fifty thousand dollars for their patent rights, twenty  thousand dollars to be paid down and the remainder in three annual  payments of ten thousand dollars each. \"We get but a song for it,\" wrote  Whitney, \"in comparison with the worth of the thing, but it is securing  something.\" Why the partners were willing to take so small a sum was  later explained by Miller. They valued the rights for South Carolina  at two hundred thousand dollars, but, since the patent law was being  infringed with impunity, they were willing to take half that amount;  \"and had flattered themselves,\" wrote Miller, \"that a sense of dignity  and justice on the part of that honorable body [the Legislature] would  not have countenanced an offer of a less sum than one hundred thousand  dollars. Finding themselves, however, to be mistaken in this opinion,  and entertaining a belief that the failure of such negotiation, after  it commenced, would have a tendency to diminish the prospect, already  doubtful, of enforcing the Patent Law, it was concluded to be best  under existing circumstances to accept the very inadequate sum of fifty  thousand dollars offered by the Legislature and thereby relinquish and  entirely abandon three-fourths of the actual value of the property.\"    But even the fifty thousand dollars was not collected without  difficulty. South Carolina suspended the contract, after paying twenty  thousand dollars, and sued Miller and Whitney for recovery of the  sum paid, on the ground that the partners had not complied with the  conditions. Whitney succeeded, in 1805, in getting the Legislature to  reinstate the contract and pay him the remainder of the money. Miller,  discouraged and broken by the long struggle, had died in the meantime.    The following passage from a letter written by Whitney in February,  1805, to Josiah Stebbins, gives Whitney's views as to the treatment he  had received at the hands of the authorities. He is writing from the  residence of a friend near Orangeburg, South Carolina.    \"The principal object of my present excursion to this Country was to get  this business set right; which I have so far"]]]
