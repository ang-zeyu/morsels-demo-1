But of all men I would that thou shouldst have  the joy of this; for thou art the crown of all Norway. The name of king  will I give thee also; and all this, because Ingibiorg's brethren would  begrudge thee any honour; and would be slower in getting thee a wife  than I am.\"    Said Frithiof: \"Have all thanks, lord, for thy goodwill beyond that I  looked for! but I will have no higher dignity than to be called earl.\"    Then King Ring gave Frithiof rule over all his realm in due wise, and  the name of earl therewith; and Frithiof was to rule it until such time  as the sons of King Ring were of age to rule their own realm. So King  Ring lay sick a little while, and then died; and great mourning was  made for him; then was there a mound cast over him, and much wealth laid  therein, according to his bidding.    Thereafter Frithiof made a noble feast, whereunto his folk came; and  thereat was drunken at one and the same time the heritage feast after  King Ring, and the bridal of Frithiof and Ingibiorg.    After these things Frithiof abode in his realm, and was deemed therein a  most noble man; he and Ingibiorg had many children.          CHAPTER XV.     Frithiof King in Sogn.    Now those kings of Sogn, the brethren of Ingibiorg, heard these tidings,  how that Frithiof had gotten a king's rule in Ringrealm, and had wedded  Ingibiorg their sister. Then says Helgi to Halfdan, his brother, that  unheard of it was, and a deed over-bold, that a mere hersir's son should  have her to wife: and so thereat they gather together a mighty army, and  go their ways therewith to Ringrealm, with the mind to slay Frithiof,  and lay all his realm under them.    But when Frithiof was ware of this, he gathered folk, and spake to the  queen moreover: \"New war is come upon our realm; and now, in whatso wise  the dealings go, fain am I that thy ways to me grow no colder.\"    She said: \"In such wise have matters gone that I must needs let thee be  the highest.\"    Now was Biorn come from the east to help Frithiof; so they fared to the  fight, and it befell, as ever erst, that Frithiof was the foremost in  the peril: King Helgi and he came to handy-blows, and there he slew King  Helgi.    Then bade Frithiof raise up the Shield of Peace, and the battle was  stayed; and therewith he cried to King Halfdan: \"Two choices are in  thine hands now, either that thou give up all to my will, or else  gettest thou thy bane like thy brother; for now may men see that mine is  the better part.\"    So Halfdan chose to lay himself and his realm under Frithiof's sway;  and so now Frithiof became ruler over Sogn-folk, and Halfdan was to be  Hersir in Sogn and pay Frithiof tribute, while Frithiof ruled Ringrealm.  So Frithiof had the name of King of Sogn-folk from the time that he gave  up Ringrealm to the sons of King Ring, and thereafter he won Hordaland  also. He and Ingibiorg had two sons, called Gunnthiof and Hunthiof, men  of might, both of them.

The women sat on the dais, and Helga the Fair sat next to the bride.  Oft she turned her eyes on Gunnlaug, thereby proving the saw, \"Eyes will  bewray if maid love man.\"    Gunnlaug was well arrayed, and had on him that goodly raiment that King  Sigtrygg had given him; and now he was thought far above all other men,  because of many things, both strength, and goodliness, and growth.    There was little mirth among folk at this wedding. But on the day when  all men were making ready to go away the women stood up and got ready  to go home. Then went Gunnlaug to talk to Helga, and long they talked  together: but Gunnlaug sang:--              \"Light-heart lived the Worm-tongue            All day long no longer            In mountain-home, since Helga            Had name of wife of Raven;            Nought foresaw thy father,            Hardener white of fight-thaw,            What my words should come to.            --The maid to gold was wedded.\"    And again he sang:--              \"Worst reward I owe them,            Father thine, O wine-may,            And mother, that they made thee            So fair beneath thy maid-gear;            For thou, sweet field of sea-flame,            All joy hast slain within me.--            Lo, here, take it, loveliest            E'er made of lord and lady!\"    And therewith Gunnlaug gave Helga the cloak, Ethelred's-gift, which was  the fairest of things, and she thanked him well for the gift.    Then Gunnlaug went out, and by that time riding-horses had been brought  home and saddled, and among them were many very good ones; and they  were all tied up in the road. Gunnlaug leaps on to a horse, and rides  a hand-gallop along the homefield up to a place where Raven happened  to stand just before him; and Raven had to draw out of his way. Then  Gunnlaug said,--    \"No need to slink aback, Raven, for I threaten thee nought as at this  time; but thou knowest forsooth, what thou hast earned.\".    Raven answered and sang,--              \"God of wound-flamed glitter,            Glorier of fight-goddess,            Must we fall a-fighting            For fairest kirtle-bearer?            Death-staffs many such-like            Fair as she is are there            In south-lands o'er the sea floods.            Sooth saith he who knoweth.\"    \"Maybe there are many such, but they do not seem so to me,\" said  Gunnlaug.    Therewith Illugi and Thorstein ran up to them, and would not have them  fight.    Then Gunnlaug sang,--              \"The fair-hued golden goddess            For gold to Raven sold they,            (Raven my match as men say)            While the mighty isle-king,            Ethelred, in England            From eastward way delayed me,            Wherefore to gold-waster            Waneth tongue's speech-hunger.\"    Hereafter both rode home, and all was quiet and tidingless that winter  through; but Raven had nought of Helga's fellowship after her meeting  with Gunnlaug.          CHAPTER XIV.     Of the Holmgang at the Althing.    Now in summer men ride a very many to the Althing: Illugi the Blacky and  his sons with him, Gunnlaug and Hermund; Thorstein Egilson and  Kolsvein his son; Onund, of Mossfell, and his sons all, and Sverting,  Hafr-Biorn's son. Skapti yet held the spokesmanship-at-law.    One day at the Thing, as men went thronging to the Hill of Laws, and  when the matters of the law were done there, then Gunnlaug craved  silence, and said:--    \"Is Raven, the son of Onund, here?\"    He said he was.    Then spake Gunnlaug, \"Thou well knowest that thou hast got to wife my  avowed bride, and thus hast thou made thyself my foe. Now for this I bid  thee to holm here at the Thing, in the holm of the Axe-water, when three  nights are gone by.\"    Raven answers, \"This is well bidden, as was to be looked for of thee,  and for this I am ready, whenever thou wiliest it.\"    Now the kin of each deemed this a very ill thing. But, at that time it  was lawful for him who thought himself wronged by another to call him to  fight on the holm.    So when three nights had gone by they got ready for the holmgang, and  Illugi the Black followed his son thither with a great following. But  Skapti, the lawman, followed Raven, and his father and other kinsmen of  his.    Now before Gunnlaug went upon the holm he sang,--              \"Out to isle ofeel-field            Dight am I to hie me:            Give, O God, thy singer            With glaive to end the striving.            Here shall I the head cleave            Of Helga's love's devourer,            At last my bright sword bringeth            Sundering of head and body.\"    Then Raven answered and sang,--              \"Thou, singer, knowest not surely            Which of us twain shall gain it;            With edge for leg-swathe eager,            Here are the wound-scythes bare now.            In whatso-wise we wound us,            The tidings from the Thing here,            And fame of thanes' fair doings,            The fair young maid shall hear it.\"    Hermund held shield for his brother, Gunnlaug; but Sverting,  Hafr-Biorn's son, was Raven's shield-bearer. Whoso should be wounded was  to ransom himself from the holm with three marks of silver.    Now, Raven's part it was to deal the first blow, as he was the  challenged man. He hewed at the upper part of Gunnlaug's shield, and the  sword brake asunder just beneath the hilt, with so great might he smote;  but the point of the sword flew up from the shield and struck Gunnlaug's  cheek, whereby he got just grazed; with that their fathers ran in  between them, and many other men.    \"Now,\" said Gunnlaug, \"I call Raven overcome, as he is weaponless.\"    \"But I say that thou art vanquished, since thou art wounded,\" said  Raven.    Now, Gunnlaug was nigh mad, and very wrathful, and said it was not tried  out yet.    Illugi, his father, said they should try no more for that time.    Gunnlaug said, \"Beyond all things I desire that I might in such wise  meet Raven again, that thou, father, wert not anigh to part us.\"    And thereat they parted for that time, and all men went back to their  booths.    But on the second day after this it was made law in the law-court that,  henceforth, all holmgangs should be forbidden; and this was done by the  counsel of all the wisest men that were at the Thing; and there, indeed,  were all the men of most counsel in all the land. And this was the last  holmgang fought in Iceland, this, wherein Gunnlaug and Raven fought.    But this Thing was the third most thronged Thing that has been held  in Iceland; the first was after Njal's burning, the second after the  Heath-slaughters.    Now, one morning, as the brothers Hermund and Gunnlaug went to Axe-water  to wash, on the other side went many women towards the river, and in  that company was Helga the Fair. Then said Hermund,--    \"Dost thou see thy friend Helga there on the other side of the river?\"    \"Surely, I see her,\" says Gunnlaug, and withal he sang:--              \"Born was she for men's bickering:            Sore bale hath wrought the war-stemy            And I yearned ever madly            To hold that oak-tree golden.            To me then, me destroyer            Of swan-mead's flame, unneedful            This looking on the dark-eyed,            This golden land's beholding.\"    Therewith they crossed the river, and Helga and Gunnlaug spake awhile  together, and as the brothers crossed the river eastward back again,  Helga stood and gazed long after Gunnlaug.    Then Gunnlaug looked back and sang:--              \"Moon of linen-lapped one,            Leek-sea-bearing goddess,            Hawk-keen out of heaven            Shone all bright upon me;            But that eyelid's moonbeam            Of gold-necklaced goddess            Her hath all undoing            Wrought, and me made nought of.\"          CHAPTER XV. How Gunnlaug and Raven agreed to go East to Norway,  to try the matter again.    Now after these things were gone by men rode home from the Thing, and  Gunnlaug dwelt at home at Gilsbank.    On a morning when he awoke all men had risen up, but he alone still lay  abed; he lay in a shut-bed behind the seats. Now into the hall came  twelve men, all full armed, and who should be there but Raven, Onund's  son; Gunnlaug sprang up forthwith, and got to his weapons.    But Raven spake, \"Thou art in risk of no hurt this time,\" quoth he, \"but  my errand hither is what thou shalt now hear: Thou didst call me to a  holmgang last summer at the Althing, and thou didst not deem matters to  be fairly tried therein; now I will offer thee this, that we both fare  away from Iceland, and go abroad next summer, and go on holm in Norway,  for there our kinsmen are not like to stand in our way.\"    Gunnlaug answered, \"Hail to thy words, stoutest of men! this thine offer  I take gladly; and here, Raven, mayest thou have cheer as good as thou  mayest desire.\"    \"It is well offered,\" said Raven, \"but this time we shall first have to  ride away.\" Thereon they parted.    Now the kinsmen of both sore misliked them of this, but could in no wise  undo it, because of the wrath of Gunnlaug and Raven; and, after all,  that must betide that drew towards.    Now it is to be said of Raven that he fitted out his ship in Leiruvag;  two men are named that went with him, sisters' sons of his father Onund,  one hight Grim, the other Olaf, doughty men both. All the kinsmen of  Raven thought it great scathe when he went away, but he said he had  challenged Gunnlaug to the holmgang because he could have no joy soever  of Helga; and he said, withal, that one must fall before the other.    So Raven put to sea, when he had wind at will, and brought his ship to  Thrandheim, and was there that winter and heard nought of Gunnlaug that  winter through; there lie abode him the summer following: and still  another winter was he in Thrandheim, at a place called Lifangr.
