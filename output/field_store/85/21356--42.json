Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the    private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. The tuna    canneries and the government are by far the two largest employers.    Other economic activities include a slowly developing tourist    industry. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to    American Samoa's economic well-being.    GDP: purchasing power parity - $128 million (1991 est.)

An excess of persons entering the  country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the  country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000  population). The net migration rate indicates the  contribution of migration to the overall level of population  change. High levels of migration can cause problems such as  increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if  people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force,  perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).    People: This category includes the entries dealing with the  characteristics of the people and their society.    People--note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names--Capitalization: The Factbook capitalizes the  surname or family name of individuals for the convenience of  our users who are faced with a world of different cultures  and naming conventions. An example would be President SADDAM  Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name and Husayn is his  father's name. He may be referred to as President SADDAM  Husayn or President SADDAM, but not President Husayn. The  need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or  some other indicator of the individual's surname is apparent  in the following examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz,  William Jefferson CLINTON, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz  Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah. By knowing  the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be  used with confidence as in President Saddam, President  Castro, Chairman Mao, President Clinton, or Sultan Tunku  Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is extended to  the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly  used such as Queen ELIZABETH II.    Personal Names--Spelling: The romanization of personal names  in the Factbook normally follows the same transliteration  system used by the US Board on Geographic Names for spelling  place names. At times, however, a foreign leader expressly  indicates a preference for, or the media or official  documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs  from the transliteration derived from the US Government  standard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative  spelling.    Personal Names--Titles: The Factbook capitalizes any valid  title (or short form of it) immediately preceding a person's  name. A title standing alone is lowercased. Examples:  President YEL'TSIN and President CLINTON are chiefs of  state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the  premier is the head of the government, while in the US, the  president is both chief of state and head of government.    Pipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of  pipelines for transporting products like natural gas, crude  oil, or petroleum products.    Political parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing  of significant political organizations and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a  listing of organizations with leaders involved in politics,  but not standing for legislative election.    Population: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau  of the Census based on statistics from population censuses,  vital statistics registration systems, or sample surveys  pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about  future trends. The total population presents one overall  measure of the potential impact of the country on the world  and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993  Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly  African) have taken into account the effects of the growing  incidence of AIDS infections. These countries are Botswana,  Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,  Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,  Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana,  Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria,  Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda,  Zambia, and Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line: National estimates of the  percentage of the population lying below the poverty line  are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results  weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions  of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example,  rich nations generally employ more generous standards of  poverty than poor nations.    Population growth rate: The average annual percent change in  the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of  births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and  leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The  growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden  would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its  people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals,  housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity),  and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening  by neighboring countries.    Ports and harbors: This entry lists the major ports and  harbors selected on the basis of overall importance to each  country. This is determined by evaluating a number of  factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,  facilities, military significance).    Radio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total  number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.    Radios: This entry gives the total number of radio  receivers.    Railways: This entry includes the total length of the  railway network and component parts by gauge: broad, dual,  narrow, standard, and other.    Reference maps: This section includes world, regional, and  special or current interest maps.    Religions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions  starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent  of total population.    Sex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each  female in five age groups--at birth, under 15 years, 15-64  years, 65 years and over, and for the total population. Sex  ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of  certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For  instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries  are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide  due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future  marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it  could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to  find partners. The sex ratio at birth for the World is 1.06  (1999 est.).    Suffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and  whether the right to vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook  consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area  code (where required) in parentheses, and the local number.  The one component that is not presented is the international  access code, which varies from country to country. For  example, an international direct dial telephone call placed  from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:    011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where    011 is the international access code for station-to-station  calls    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),    [34] is the country code for Spain,    (1) is the city code for Madrid,    577 is the local exchange, and    xxxx is the local telephone number.    An international direct dial telephone call placed from  another country to the US would be as follows:    international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where    [1] is the country code for the US,    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,    939 is the local exchange, and    xxxx is the local telephone number.    Telephone system: This entry includes a brief  characterization of the system with details on the domestic  and international components. The following terms and  abbreviations are used throughout the entry:    Arabsat--Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia).    Autodin--Automatic Digital Network (US Department of  Defense).    CB--citizen's band mobile radio communications.    cellular telephone system--the telephones in this system are  radio    transceivers, with each instrument having its own private  radio frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the  booster station in its area (cell), from which the telephone  signal is fed to a regular telephone exchange.    Central American Microwave System--a trunk microwave radio  relay system that links the countries of Central America and  Mexico with each other.    coaxial cable--a multichannel communication cable consisting  of a central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated  from a cylindrical conducting shell; a large number of  telephone channels can be made available within the  insulated space by the use of a large number of carrier  frequencies.    Comsat--Communications Satellite Corporation (US).    DSN--Defense Switched Network (formerly Automatic Voice  Network or Autovon); basic general-purpose, switched voice  network of the Defense Communications System (US Department  of Defense).    Eutelsat--European Telecommunications Satellite Organization  (Paris).    fiber-optic cable--a multichannel communications cable using  a thread of optical glass fibers as a transmission medium in  which the signal (voice, video, etc.) is in the form of a  coded pulse of light.    HF-- high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to  30,000-kHz range.    Inmarsat--International Mobile Satellite Organization  (London); provider of global mobile satellite communications  for commercial, distress, and safety applications at sea, in  the air, and on land.    Intelsat--International Telecommunications Satellite  Organization (Washington, DC).    Intersputnik--International Organization of Space"]]]
