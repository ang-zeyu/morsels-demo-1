He  stooped to this dry spot and lifted up a little blanket or carpet of  matted dry grass and revealed one of the prettiest sights I had ever  seen, and the only one of the kind I had ever looked upon!--four or five  little rabbits half the size of chipmunks, cuddled down in a dry  fur-lined nest. They did not move or wink, and their ears were pressed  down close to their heads. My neighbor let the coverlet fall back, and  they were hidden again as by magic.    They had been discovered a few days before when the lawn was mown, and  one, as it sprang out from the nest, was killed by the mower, who  mistook it for a young rat. The rest of them fled and disappeared  through the grass, but the next morning they were back in the nest,  where they remained for several days longer. Only at night, so far as  was observed, did the mother visit and nurse them.    There was no opening into the nest, the mat of dried grass covered it  completely, so that the mother, in her visits to them, must have lifted  it up and crept beneath. It was a very pretty and cunning device. One  might have stepped upon it in his walk, but surely his eyes alone would  never have penetrated the secret. I am told by men wise in the lore of  the fields and woods that the rabbit always covers her nest and young  with a little blanket, usually made of fur plucked from her own breast.    [Illustration: GRAY RABBIT]    The rabbit seems to suffer very little from the deep snows and severe  cold of winter. The deeper the snow, the nearer she is brought to the  tops of the tender bushes and shoots. I see in my walks where she has  cropped the tops of the small, bushy, soft maples, cutting them  slantingly as you would with a knife, and quite as smoothly. Indeed, the  mark was so like that of a knife that, notwithstanding the tracks, it  was only after the closest scrutiny that I was convinced it was the  sharp, chisel-like teeth of the rabbit. She leaves no chips, and  apparently makes clean work of every twig she cuts off.    The hare is nocturnal in its habits, and though a very lively creature  at night, with regular courses and run-ways through the wood, is  entirely quiet by day. Timid as he is, he makes little effort to conceal  himself, usually squatting beside a log, stump, or tree, and seeming to  avoid rocks and ledges where he might be partially housed from the cold  and the snow, but where also--and this consideration undoubtedly  determines his choice--he would be more apt to fall a prey to his  enemies. In this, as well as in many other respects, he differs from the  rabbit proper. He never burrows in the ground, or takes refuge in a den  or hole, when pursued. If caught in the open fields, he is much confused  and easily overtaken by the dog; but in the woods, he leaves his enemy  at a bound. In summer, when first disturbed, he beats the ground  violently with his feet, by which means he would express to you his  surprise or displeasure; it is a dumb way he has of scolding. After  leaping a few yards, he pauses an instant, as if to determine the degree  of danger, and then hurries away with a much lighter tread.    His feet are like great pads, and his track in the snow has little of  the sharp, articulated expression of Reynard's, or of animals that climb  or dig. Yet it is very pretty, like all the rest, and tells its own  tale. There is nothing bold or vicious or vulpine in it, and his timid,  harmless character is published at every leap. He abounds in dense  woods, preferring localities filled with a small undergrowth of beech  and birch, upon the bark of which he feeds. Nature is rather partial to  him, and matches his extreme local habits and character with a suit that  corresponds with his surroundings,--reddish gray in summer and white in  winter.          V    THE MUSKRAT      It sometimes looks as if the muskrat were weather-wise and could  forecast the coming season. I doubt if a long series of observations  would bear out the truth of this remark, yet I have noticed that in his  nest-building he sometimes hits the mark with surprising accuracy.    In the fall of 1878 I observed that he built unusually high and massive  nests. I noticed them in several different localities. In a shallow,  sluggish pond by the roadside, which I used to pass daily in my walk,  two nests were in process of construction throughout the month of  November. The builders worked only at night, and I could see each day  that the work had visibly advanced. When there was a slight skim of ice  over the pond, this was broken up about the nests, with trails through  it in different directions where the material had been brought. The  houses were placed a little to one side of the main channel, and were  constructed entirely of a species of coarse wild grass that grew all  about. So far as I could see, from first to last they were solid masses  of grass, as if the interior cavity or nest was to be excavated  afterward, as doubtless it was. As they emerged from the pond they  gradually assumed the shape of a miniature mountain, very bold and steep  on the south side, and running down a long gentle grade to the surface  of the water on the north. One could see that the little architect  hauled all his material up this easy slope, and thrust it out boldly  around the other side. Every mouthful was distinctly defined. After they  were two feet or more above the water, I expected each day to see that  the finishing stroke had been given and the work brought to a close. But  higher yet, said the builder.    December drew near, the cold became threatening, and I was apprehensive  that winter would suddenly shut down upon those unfinished nests. But  the wise muskrats seemed to know better than I did. Finally, about the  6th of December, the nests assumed completion; the northern incline was  absorbed or carried up, and each structure became a strong massive cone,  three or four feet high, the largest nest of the kind I had ever seen.  \"Does it mean a severe winter?\" I inquired. An old farmer said it meant  \"high water,\" and he was right once, at least, for in a few days  afterward we had the heaviest rainfall known in this section for half a  century. The creeks rose to an almost unprecedented height. The sluggish  pond became a seething, turbulent watercourse; gradually the angry  element crept up the sides of these lake dwellings, till, when the rain  ceased, about four o'clock, they showed above the flood no larger than a  man's hat. During the night the channel shifted till the main current  swept over them, and next day not a vestige of the nests was to be seen;  they had gone downstream, as had many other dwellings of a less  temporary character. The rats had built wisely, and would have been  perfectly secure against any ordinary high water, but who can foresee a  flood? The oldest traditions of their race did not run back to the time  of such a visitation.    Nearly a week afterward another dwelling was begun, well away from the  treacherous channel, but the architects did not work at it with much  heart; the material was very scarce, the ice hindered, and before the  basement-story was fairly finished, winter had the pond under his lock  and key.    In other localities I noticed that where the nests were placed on the  banks of streams, they were made secure against the floods by being  built amid a small clump of bushes. When the fall of 1879 came, the  muskrats were very tardy about beginning their house, laying the  cornerstone--or the corner-sod--about December 1, and continuing the  work slowly and indifferently. On the 15th of the month the nest was not  yet finished. \"Maybe,\" I said, \"this indicates a mild winter;\" and, sure  enough, the season was one of the mildest known for many years. The rats  had little use for their house.    [Illustration: MUSKRAT]    Again, in the fall of 1880, while the weather-wise were wagging their  heads, some forecasting a mild, some a severe winter, I watched with  interest for a sign from my muskrats. About November 1, a month earlier  than the previous year, they began their nest, and worked at it with a  will. They appeared to have just got tidings of what was coming. If I  had taken the hint so palpably given, my celery would not have been  frozen up in the ground, and my apples caught in unprotected places.  When the cold wave struck us, about November 20, my four-legged \"I  told-you-so's\" had nearly completed their dwelling; it lacked only the  ridge-board, so to speak; it needed a little \"topping out,\" to give it a  finished look. But this it never got. The winter had come to stay, and  it waxed more and more severe, till the unprecedented cold of the last  days of December must have astonished even the wise muskrats in their  snug retreat. I approached their nest at this time, a white mound upon  the white, deeply frozen surface of the pond, and wondered if there was  any life in that apparent sepulchre. I thrust my walking-stick sharply  into it, when there was a rustle and a splash into the water, as the  occupant made his escape. What a damp basement that house has, I  thought, and what a pity to rout a peaceful neighbor out of his bed in  this weather, and into such a state of things as this! But water does  not wet the muskrat; his fur is charmed, and not a drop penetrates it.    Where the ground is favorable, the muskrats do not build these  mound-like nests, but burrow into the bank a long distance, and  establish their winter quarters there.    The muskrat does not hibernate like some rodents, but is pretty active  all winter. In December I noticed in my walk where they had made  excursions of a few yards to an orchard for frozen apples. One day,  along a little stream, I saw a mink track amid those of the muskrat;  following"]]]
