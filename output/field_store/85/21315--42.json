In this dilemma between the testimony of his senses and the results of  calculation, he waited for the following night with the utmost anxiety;  but his hopes were disappointed, for the heavens were wholly veiled in  clouds. On the 10th, two only of the stars appeared, and both on the  east of the planet. As it was obviously impossible that Jupiter could  have advanced from west to east on the 8th of January, and from east to  west on the 10th, Galileo was forced to conclude that the phenomenon  which he had observed arose from the motion of the stars, and he set  himself to observe diligently their change of place. On the 11th, there  were still only two stars, and both to the east of Jupiter; but the more  eastern star was now _twice as large as the other one_, though on the  preceding night they had been perfectly equal. This fact threw a new  light upon Galileo's difficulties, and he immediately drew the  conclusion, which he considered to be indubitable, \"_that there were in  the heavens three stars which revolved round Jupiter, in the same manner  as Venus and Mercury revolve round the sun_.\" On the 12th of January, he  again observed them in new positions, and of different magnitudes; and,  on the 13th, he discovered a fourth star, which completed the _four_  secondary planets with which Jupiter is surrounded.    Galileo continued his observations on these bodies every clear night  till the 22d of March, and studied their motions in reference to fixed  stars that were at the same time within the field of his telescope.  Having thus clearly established that the four new stars were satellites  or moons, which revolved round Jupiter in the same manner as the moon  revolves round our own globe, he drew up an account of his discovery, in  which he gave to the four new bodies the names of the _Medicean Stars_,  in honour of his patron, Cosmo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. This  work, under the title of \"Nuncius Sidereus,\" or the \"Sidereal  Messenger,\" was dedicated to the same prince; and the dedication bears  the date of the 24th of March, only two days after he concluded his  observations.    The importance of this great discovery was instantly felt by the enemies  as well as by the friends of the Copernican system. The planets had  hitherto been distinguished from the fixed stars only by their relative  change of place, but the telescope proved them to be bodies so near to  our own globe as to exhibit well-defined discs, while the fixed stars  retained, even when magnified, the minuteness of remote and lucid  points. The system of Jupiter, illuminated by four moons performing  their revolutions in different and regular periods, exhibited to the  proud reason of man the comparative insignificance of the globe he  inhabits, and proclaimed in impressive language that that globe was not  the centre of the universe.    The reception which these discoveries met with from Kepler is highly  interesting, and characteristic of the genius of that great man. He was  one day sitting idle, and thinking of Galileo, when his friend  Wachenfels stopped his carriage at his door, to communicate to him the  intelligence. \"Such a fit of wonder,\" says he, \"seized me at a report  which seemed to be so very absurd, and I was thrown into such agitation  at seeing an old dispute between us decided in this way, that between  his joy, my colouring, and the laughter of both, confounded as we were  by such a novelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or I of  listening. On our parting, I immediately began to think how there could  be any addition to the number of the planets without overturning my  'Cosmographic Mystery,' according to which Euclid's five regular solids  do not allow more than six planets round the sun.... I am so far from  disbelieving the existence of the four circumjovial planets, that I long  for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering _two_  round Mars, as the proportion seems to require, _six_ or _eight_ round  Saturn, and perhaps _one_ each round Mercury and Venus.\"    In a very different spirit did the Aristotelians receive the \"Sidereal  Messenger\" of Galileo. The principal professor of philosophy at Padua  resisted Galileo's repeated and urgent entreaties to look at the moon  and planets through his telescope; and he even laboured to convince the  Grand Duke that the satellites of Jupiter could not possibly exist.  Sizzi, an astronomer of Florence, maintained that as there were only  _seven_ apertures in the head--_two_ eyes, _two_ ears, _two_ nostrils,  and _one_ mouth--and as there were only _seven_ metals, and _seven_ days  in the week, so there could be only _seven_ planets. He seems, however,  to have admitted the visibility of the four satellites through the  telescope; but he argues, that as they are invisible to the naked eye,  they can exercise no influence on the earth; and being useless, they do  not therefore exist.    A _protege_ of Kepler's, of the name of Horky, wrote a volume against  Galileo's discovery, after having declared, \"that he would never concede  his four new planets to that Italian from Padua, even if he should die  for it.\" This resolute Aristotelian was at no loss for arguments. He  asserted that he had examined the heavens _through Galileo's own glass_,  and that no such thing as a satellite existed round Jupiter. He  affirmed, that he did not more surely know that he had a soul in his  body, than that reflected rays are the sole cause of Galileo's erroneous  observations; and that the only use of the new planets was to gratify  Galileo's thirst for gold, and afford to himself a subject of  discussion.    When Horky first presented himself to Kepler, after the publication of  this work, the opinion of his patron was announced to him by a burst of  indignation which overwhelmed the astonished author. Horky supplicated  mercy for his offence; and, as Kepler himself informed Galileo, he took  him again into favour, on the condition that Kepler was to show him  Jupiter's satellites, and that Horky was not only to see them, but to  admit their existence.    When the spirit of philosophy had thus left the individuals who bore so  unworthily her sacred name, it was fortunate for science that it found a  refuge among princes. Notwithstanding the reiterated logic of his  philosophical professor at Padua, Cosmo de Medici preferred the  testimony of his senses to the syllogisms of his instructor. He observed  the new planets several times, along with Galileo, at Pisa; and when he  parted with him, he gave him a present worth more than 1000 florins, and  concluded that liberal arrangement to which we have already referred.    As philosopher and principal mathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany,  Galileo now took up his residence at Florence, with a salary of 1000  florins. No official duties, excepting that of lecturing occasionally to  sovereign princes, were attached to this appointment; and it was  expressly stipulated that he should enjoy the most perfect leisure to  complete his treatises on the constitution of the universe, on  mechanics, and on local motion. The resignation of his professorship in  the university of Padua, which was the necessary consequence of his new  appointment, created much dissatisfaction: but though many of his former  friends refused at first to hold any communication with him, this  excitement gradually subsided; and the Venetian senate at last  appreciated the feelings, as well as the motives, which induced a  stranger to accept of promotion in his native land.    While Galileo was enjoying the reward and the fame of his great  discovery, a new species of enmity was roused against him. Simon Mayer,  an astronomer of no character, pretended that he had discovered the  satellites of Jupiter before Galileo, and that his first observation was  made on the 29th of December, 1609. Other astronomers announced the  discovery of new satellites: Scheiner reckoned five, Rheita nine, and  others found even so many as twelve: these satellites, however, were  found to be only fixed stars. The names of _Vladislavian_, _Agrippine_,  _Uranodavian_, and _Ferdinandotertian_, which were hastily given to  these common telescopic stars, soon disappeared from the page of  science, and even the splendid telescopes of modern times have not been  able to add another gem to the diadem of Jupiter.    A modern astronomer of no mean celebrity has, even in the present day,  endeavoured to rob Galileo of this staple article of his reputation.  From a careless examination of the papers of our celebrated countryman,  Thomas Harriot, which Baron Zach had made in 1784, at Petworth, the seat  of Lord Egremont, this astronomer has asserted[13] that Harriot first  observed the satellites of Jupiter on the 16th of January, 1610; and  continued his observations till the 25th of February, 1612. Baron Zach  adds the following extraordinary conclusion:--\"Galileo pretends to have  discovered them on the 7th of January, 1610; so that it is not  improbable that Harriot was likewise the first discoverer of these  attendants of Jupiter.\" In a communication which I received from Dr  Robertson, of Oxford, in 1822,[14] he informed me that he had examined a  portion of Harriot's papers, entitled, \"De Jovialibus Planetis;\" and  that it appears, from two pages of these papers, _that Harriot first  observed Jupiter's satellites on the 17th of October, 1610_. These  observations are accompanied with rough drawings of the positions of the  satellites, and rough calculations of their periodical revolutions. My  friend, Professor Rigaud,[15] who has very recently examined the Harriot  MSS., has confirmed the accuracy of Dr Robertson's observations, and has  thus restored to Galileo the honour of being the first and the sole  discoverer of these secondary planets.

For Halloween there is a design of witches with brooms, or cats and bats  in black on a yellow ground. This is ready to be laid on the table as a  cover or around the room in the effect of a frieze. There are napkins to  match and a crepe paper rope to finish the edge.    A weird effect of lighting is obtained by making lantern boxes from any  discarded boxes which may be in the house. Cover them with crepe paper,  cut eyes, nose, ears and mouth, paste colored tissue paper behind the  features and set a lighted candle inside.    The wise owl must not be forgotten in the Halloween decorations. Grey  paper is best for him. Paste the edges of a square piece of grey crepe  paper together lengthwise of the grain and gather in at the bottom.  Stuff this bag with soft paper or cotton and gather again some distance  from the top. Shape the top into ears and make two rosettes with black  centers for eyes. A beak of black stiff paper protrudes between the  eyes. Mount the owl on a branch by sewing with heavy black thread in a  way to resemble claws.    Make witches' brooms by tying slashed paper tied on any old sticks or  brooms to give the effect.           *       *       *       *       *    How to Clean It      Brass Ornaments    Any brass which is exposed to the air is likely to tarnish very quickly.  To obviate this, after I have cleaned and polished my brass vases etc.,  in the usual way I take a rag, and with this smear just a tiny scrap of  vaseline over the brass. This keeps it bright and prevents it from  tarnishing.      Wicker Tables or Chairs    To take stains out of white wicker-work, I get some oxalic acid, and  with an old toothbrush dipped in this I brush the stained parts well.  Then I rinse the article thoroughly, first in clear, warm water, and  then in cold. The brush should be destroyed after use, as oxalic acid is  poisonous.      To Wash Chiffon    To wash chiffon, wind the material round a bottle. Make a good lather of  soap and water. Immerse the bottle, and move backwards and forwards in  the lather for about five minutes. Rinse in clear, lukewarm water in  which has been dissolved a small piece of gum arabic. Then unwind the  chiffon, spread on the ironing board, lay a clean, thin cloth over it,  and iron with a very hot iron.      A Black Hat    The very best way to clean a black hat, whether it be chip, mohair, or  tagel, real or imitation, is to make some rather strong tea, and, after  brushing all dust from the hat, apply this with a small brush. Saturate  the hat thoroughly, and when dry it will be as perfect in colour and  appearance as when first bought.    If you want the hat to be stiff, add half a teaspoonful of liquid gum to  the tea, and mix well before applying. The hat will then keep its  stiffness, but will not have a glossy appearance.      Real Lace    Real lace should never be washed, but can be cleaned in the following  way. Put it between layers of tissue paper well sprinkled with calcined  magnesia, place between the leaves of a book, and under a heavy weight  for three days. Then shake the powder out and the lace will be perfectly  clean.          Small Pieces from the Whole Ham         The economy of buying a whole ham at once instead of a pound       or a slice is apparent to every housewife who studies her       weekly bills. The initial cost is less--many trips to the       store are saved and the housewife has the chance of using       all of the ham--trimmings, skin, bone, etc., etc.      HAM TOAST    Grind or chop enough Armour's Star Ham to make a cupful, using a little  of the fat. Melt one tablespoon of butter in a sauce pan and add one  tablespoon of flour. As soon as blended add one and one third cups of  milk. When slightly thickened add the ham and the whites of two  hard-boiled eggs which have been mashed with fork. Season with salt,  pepper, and pour over round slices of toast which have been placed on  hot platter. Grate the yolks of eggs and sprinkle over the top. Garnish  with parsley.--MRS. G. F. JONES, 79 WASHINGTON ST., PORTLAND, MAINE.      HAM DUMPLINGS    Cut from a boiled Star Ham fat and lean in equal proportions and chop  fine. Season with pepper and minced sage. Make a crust of one half pound  of Armour's Butterine and one pound of flour. Roll it out thick and  divide it into equal portions. Put some ham into each and close up the  crust. Have ready a pot of boiling water and put in the dumplings. Boil  about forty-five minutes.--MISS M. C. GREEN, 319 LOCUST ST., HUNTSVILLE,  ALA.      HAM RELISH    One cup of Armour's Star Ham boiled and chopped fine, one half cup of  cream, three hard-boiled eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Scald the  cream. Rub the yolks smooth with a little of the cream and add to the  cream in the farina boiler with the ham. Press the whites of the two  eggs through a sieve, add to the mixture and when thoroughly heated put  on a hot dish. Slice the remaining eggs over the ham and serve.--MRS. R.  SCHROEDER, 1923 AVENUE D, BIRMINGHAM, ALA.      ESCALLOPED HAM    Boil six eggs ten minutes. Make a thickening of two tablespoons of flour  cooked in two tablespoons of melted butter, and boil it in a pint of  milk until thick. Season with salt and pepper. Cut a cup of Armour's  Star Ham (cold boiled) into dice and moisten half a cup of cracker  crumbs in melted butter. Chop the whites of the eggs fine, sprinkle some  crumbs in a buttered dish, then some of the ham, the chopped whites,  thickened milk and sifted yolks. Then add the remainder of the ham,  whites of eggs and milk, cover with buttered crumbs and bake until  brown.---ALMA E. EDDY, COLLEGE CITY, CAL.      BAKED LEFT-OVERS    One cup of Armour's Star Ham chopped fine, one half cup of bread crumbs  and one half cup of chopped hard-boiled eggs.
