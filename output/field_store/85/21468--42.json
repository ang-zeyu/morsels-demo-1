It was  no wonder then, every man of the Brisk who first looked upon them did so  with a feeling of loathing and abhorrence of such a trade. All over the  vessel, but more especially below, old women, stark naked, were dying  in the most disgusting \"ferret-box\" atmosphere; while all those who had  sufficient strength were pulling up the hatches, and tearing at the salt  fish they found below, like dogs in a kennel.    On the 15th the Manuela was sent to the Mauritius, and we, after passing  the Comoro Islands, arrived at our destination, Zanzibar--called Lunguja  by the aborigines, the Wakhadim--and Unguja by the present Wasuahili.    On the 17th, after the anchor was cast, without a moment's delay I went  off to the British Consulate to see my old friend Colonel Rigby. He was  delighted to see us; and, in anticipation of our arrival, had prepared  rooms for our reception, that both Captain Grant and myself might enjoy  his hospitality until arrangements could be made for our final start  into the interior. The town, which I had left in so different a  condition sixteen months before, was in a state of great tranquillity,  brought about by the energy of the Bombay Government on the Muscat  side, and Colonel Rigby's exertions on this side, in preventing an  insurrection Sultan Majid's brothers had created with a view of usurping  his government.    The news of the place was as follows:--In addition to the formerly  constituted consulates--English, French, and American--a fourth one,  representing Hamburg, had been created. Dr Roscher, who during my  absence had made a successful journey to the N'yinyezi N'yassa, or  Star Lake, was afterwards murdered by some natives in Uhiyow; and  Lieutentant-Colonel Baron van der Decken, another enterprising German,  was organising an expedition with a view to search for the relics of  his countryman, and, if possible, complete the project poor Roscher had  commenced.    Slavery had received a severe blow by the sharp measures Colonel Rigby  had taken in giving tickets of emancipation to all those slaves whom our  Indian subjects the Banyans had been secretly keeping, and by fining  the masters and giving the money to the men to set them up in life. The  interior of the continent had been greatly disturbed, owing to constant  war between the natives and Arab ivory merchants. Mguru Mfupi (or  Short-legs), the chief of Khoko in Ugogo, for instance, had been shot,  and Manua Sera (the Tippler), who succeeded the old Sultan Fundi Kira,  of Unyanyembe, on his death, shortly after the late expedition left  Kaze, was out in the field fighting the Arabs. Recent letters from  the Arabs in the interior, however, gave hopes of peace being shortly  restored. Finally, in compliance with my request--and this was the most  important item of news to myself--Colonel Rigby had sent on, thirteen  days previously, fifty-six loads of cloth and beads, in charge of two of  Ramji's men, consigned to Musa at Kaze.    To call on the Sultan, of course, was our first duty. He received us  in his usually affable manner; made many trite remarks concerning our  plans; was surprised, if my only object in view was to see the great  river running out of the lake, that I did not go by the more direct  route across the Masai country and Usoga; and then, finding I wished to  see Karague, as well as to settle many other great points of interest,  he offered to assist me with all the means in his power.    The Hottentots, the mules, and the baggage having been landed, our  preparatory work began in earnest. It consisted in proving the sextants;  rating the watches; examining the compasses and boiling thermometers;  making tents and packsaddles; ordering supplies of beads, cloth, and  brass wire; and collecting servants and porters.    Sheikh Said bin Salem, our late Cafila Bashi, or caravan captain, was  appointed to that post again, as he wished to prove his character for  honour and honesty; and it now transpired that he had been ordered not  to go with me when I discovered the Victoria N'yanza. Bombay and his  brother Mabruki were bound to me of old, and the first to greet me on  my arrival here; while my old friends the Beluchs begged me to take  them again. The Hottentots, however, had usurped their place. I was  afterwards sorry for this, though, if I ever travel again, I shall  trust to none but natives, as the climate of Africa is too trying to  foreigners. Colonel Rigby, who had at heart as much as anybody the  success of the expedition, materially assisted me in accomplishing my  object--that men accustomed to discipline and a knowledge of English  honour and honesty should be enlisted, to give confidence to the rest  of the men; and he allowed me to select from his boat's crew any men I  could find who had served as men-of-war, and had seen active service in  India.    For this purpose my factotum, Bombay, prevailed on Baraka, Frij, and  Rahan--all of them old sailors, who, like himself, knew Hindustani--to  go with me. With this nucleus to start with, I gave orders that they  should look out for as many Wanguana (freed men--i.e., men emancipated  from slavery) as they could enlist, to carry loads, or do any other work  required of them, and to follow men in Africa wherever I wished, until  our arrival in Egypt, when I would send them back to Zanzibar. Each was  to receive one year's pay in advance, and the remainder when their work  was completed.    While this enlistment was going on here, Ladha Damji, the customs'  master, was appointed to collect a hundred pagazis (Wanyamuezi porters)  to carry each a load of cloth, beads, or brass wire to Kaze, as they do  for the ivory merchants. Meanwhile, at the invitation of the Admiral,  and to show him some sport in hippopotamus-shooting, I went with him in  a dhow over to Kusiki, near which there is a tidal lagoon, which at high  tide is filled with water, but at low water exposes sand islets covered  with mangrove shrub. In these islets we sought for the animals, knowing  they were keen to lie wallowing in the mire, and we bagged two. On my  return to Zanzibar, the Brisk sailed for the Mauritius, but fortune sent  Grant and myself on a different cruise. Sultan Majid, having heard that  a slaver was lying at Pangani, and being anxious to show his good faith  with the English, begged me to take command of one his vessels of war  and run it down. Accordingly, embarking at noon, as soon as the vessel  could be got ready, we lay-to that night at Tombat, with a view of  surprising the slaver next morning; but next day, on our arrival at  Pangani, we heard that she had merely put in to provision there three  days before, and had let immediately afterwards. As I had come so far, I  thought we might go ashore and look at the town, which was found greatly  improved since I last saw it, by the addition of several coralline  houses and a dockyard. The natives were building a dhow with Lindi and  Madagascar timber. On going ashore, I might add, we were stranded on the  sands, and, coming off again, nearly swamped by the increasing surf on  the bar of the river; but this was a trifle; all we thought of was to  return to Zanzibar, and hurry on our preparations there. This, however,  was not so easy: the sea current was running north, and the wind was too  light to propel our vessel against it; so, after trying in vain to make  way in her, Grant and I, leaving her to follow, took to a boat, after  giving the captain, who said we would get drowned, a letter, to say we  left the vessel against his advice.    We had a brave crew of young negroes to pull us; but, pull as they  would, the current was so strong that we feared, if we persisted, we  should be drawn into the broad Indian Ocean; so, changing our line, we  bore into the little coralline island, Maziwa, where, after riding over  some ugly coral surfs, we put in for the night. There we found, to our  relief, some fisherman, who gave us fish for our dinner, and directions  how to proceed.    Next morning, before daylight, we trusted to the boat and our good luck.  After passing, without landmarks to guide us, by an intricate channel,  through foaming surfs, we arrived at Zanzibar in the night, and found  that the vessel had got in before us.    Colonel Rigby now gave me a most interesting paper, with a map attached  to it, about the Nile and the Mountains of the Moon. It was written  by Lieutenant Wilford, from the \"Purans\" of the Ancient Hindus. As it  exemplifies, to a certain extent, the supposition I formerly arrived at  concerning the Mountains of the Moon being associated with the country  of the Moon, I would fain draw the attention of the reader of my travels  to the volume of the \"Asiatic Researches\" in which it was published. [5]  It is remarkable that the Hindus have christened the source of the Nile  Amara, which is the name of a country at the north-east corner of the  Victoria N'yanza. This, I think, shows clearly, that the ancient Hindus  must have had some kind of communication with both the northern and  southern ends of the Victoria N'yanza.    Having gone to work again, I found that Sheikh Said had brought ten men,  four of whom were purchased for one hundred dollars, which I had to pay;  Bombay, Baraka, Frij, and Rahan had brought twenty-six more, all freed  men; while the Sultan Majid, at the suggestion of Colonel Rigby, gave me  thirty-four men more, who were all raw labourers taken from his gardens.  It was my intention to have taken one hundred of this description of  men throughout the whole journey; but as so many could not be found in  Zanzibar, I still hoped to fill up the complement in Unyamuezi, the  land of the Moon, from the large establishments of the Arab merchants  residing there. The payment of these men's wages for the first year, as  well as the terms of the agreement made with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#6)"],[1,"'t guess. Who is it?\" It was a very bright and very  sweet face, with large, serious, gray-brown eyes that looked down on the  little boy.    \"Guess, mamma!\"    \"Why, who can it be? Big Mack?\"    \"No!\" Hughie danced delightedly. \"Try again. He's not big.\"    \"I am sure I can never guess. Whoa, Pony!\" Pony was most unwilling to  get in close enough to the gate-post to let Hughie spring on behind his  mother.    \"You'll have to be quick, Hughie, when I get near again. There now!  Whoa, Pony! Take care, child!\"    Hughie had sprung clean off the post, and lighting on Pony's back just  behind the saddle, had clutched his mother round the waist, while the  pony started off full gallop for the stable.    \"Now, mother, who is it?\" insisted Hughie, as Lambert, the  French-Canadian man-of-all-work, lifted him from his place.    \"You'll have to tell me, Hughie!\"    \"Ranald!\"    \"Ranald?\"    \"Yes, Ranald and his father, Macdonald Dubh, and he's hurted awful bad,  and--\"    \"Hurt, Hughie,\" interposed the mother, gently.    \"Huh-huh! Ranald said he was hurted.\"    \"Hurt, you mean, Hughie. Who was hurt? Ranald?\"    \"No; his father was hurted--hurt--awful bad. He was lying down in the  sleigh, and Yankee Jim--\"    \"Mr. Latham, you mean, Hughie.\"    \"Huh-huh,\" went on Hughie, breathlessly, \"and Yankee--Mr. Latham asked  if the minister was home, and I said 'No,' and then they went away.\"    \"What was the matter? Did you see them, Lambert?\"    \"Oui\" (\"Way,\" Lambert pronounced it), \"but dey not tell me what he's  hurt.\"    The minister's wife went toward the house, with a shadow on her face.  She shared with her husband his people's sorrows. She knew even better  than he the life-history of every family in the congregation. Macdonald  Dubh had long been classed among the wild and careless in the community,  and it weighed upon her heart that his life might be in danger.    \"I shall see him to-morrow,\" she said to herself.    For a few moments she stood on the doorstep looking at the glow in the  sky over the dark forest, which on the west side came quite up to the  house and barn.    \"Look, Hughie, at the beautiful tints in the clouds, and see the dark  shadows pointing out toward us from the bush.\" Hughie glanced a moment.    \"Mamma,\" he said, \"I am just dead for supper.\"    \"Oh, not quite, I hope, Hughie. But look, I want you to notice those  clouds and the sky behind them. How lovely! Oh, how wonderful!\"    Her enthusiasm caught the boy, and for a few moment she forgot even his  hunger, and holding his mother's hand, gazed up at the western sky. It  was a picture of rare beauty that lay stretched out from the manse back  door. Close to the barn came the pasture-field dotted with huge stumps,  then the brule where the trees lay fallen across one another, over  which the fire had run, and then the solid wall of forest here and there  overtopped by the lofty crest of a white pine. Into the forest in the  west the sun was descending in gorgeous robes of glory. The treetops  caught the yellow light, and gleamed like the golden spires of some  great and fabled city.    \"Oh, mamma, see that big pine top! Doesn't it look like windows?\" cried  Hughie, pointing to one of the lofty pine crests through which the sky  quivered like molten gold.    \"And the streets of the city are pure gold,\" said the mother, softly.    \"Yes, I know,\" said Hughie, confidently, for to him all the scenes and  stories of the Bible had long been familiar. \"Is it like that, mamma?\"    \"Much better, ever so much better than you can think.\"    \"Oh, mamma, I'm just awful hungry!\"    \"Come away, then; so am I. What have you got, Jessie, for two very  hungry people?\"    \"Porridge and pancakes,\" said Jessie, the minister's \"girl,\" who not  only ruled in the kitchen, but using the kitchen as a base, controlled  the interior economy of the manse.    \"Oh, goody!\" yelled Hughie; \"just what I like.\" And from the plates of  porridge and the piles of pancakes that vanished from his plate no one  could doubt his word.    Their reading that night was about the city whose streets were of pure  gold, and after a little talk, Hughie and his baby brother were tucked  away safely for the night, and the mother sat down to her never-ending  task of making and mending.    The minister was away at Presbytery meeting in Montreal, and for ten  days his wife would stand in the breach. Of course the elders would take  the meeting on the Sabbath day and on the Wednesday evening, but for all  other ministerial duties when the minister was absent the congregation  looked to the minister's wife. And soon it came that the sick and the  sorrowing and the sin-burdened found in the minister's wife such help  and comfort and guidance as made the absence of the minister seem no  great trial after all. Eight years ago the minister had brought his wife  from a home of gentle culture, from a life of intellectual and artistic  pursuits, and from a circle of loving friends of which she was the pride  and joy, to this home in the forest. There, isolated from all congenial  companionship with her own kind, deprived of all the luxuries and of  many of the comforts of her young days, and of the mental stimulus of  that contact of minds without which few can maintain intellectual life,  she gave herself without stint to her husband's people, with never a  thought of self-pity or self-praise. By day and by night she labored for  her husband and family and for her people, for she thought them hers.  She taught the women how to adorn their rude homes, gathered them into  Bible classes and sewing circles, where she read and talked and wrought  and prayed with them till they grew to adore her as a saint, and to  trust her as a leader and friend, and to be a little like her. And not  the women only, but the men, too, loved and trusted her, and the big  boys found it easier to talk to the minister's wife than to the minister  or to any of his session. She made her own and her children's clothes,  collars, hats, and caps, her husband's shirts and neckties, toiling late  into the morning hours, and all without frown or shadow of complaint,  and indeed without suspicion that any but the happiest lot was hers, or  that she was, as her sisters said, \"just buried alive in the backwoods.\"  Not she! She lived to serve, and the where and how were not hers to  determine. So, with bright face and brave heart, she met her days and  faced the battle. And scores of women and men are living better and  braver lives because they had her for their minister's wife.    But the day had been long, and the struggle with the March wind pulls  hard upon the strength, and outside the pines were crooning softly,  and gradually the brave head drooped till between the stitches she  fell asleep. But not for many minutes, for a knock at the kitchen door  startled her, and before long she heard Jessie's voice rise wrathful.    \"Indeed, I'll do no such thing. This is no time to come to the  minister's house.\"    For answer there was a mumble of words.    \"Well, then, you can just wait until morning. She can go in the  morning.\"    \"What is it, Jessie?\" The minister's wife came into the kitchen.    \"Oh, Ranald, I'm glad to see you back. Hughie told me you had come. But  your father is ill, he said. How is he?\"    Ranald shook hands shyly, feeling much ashamed under Jessie's sharp  reproof.    \"Indeed, it was Aunt Kirsty that sent me,\" said Ranald, apologetically.    \"Then she ought to have known better,\" said Jessie, sharply.    \"Never mind, Jessie. Ranald, tell me about your father.\"    \"He is very bad indeed, and my aunt is afraid that--\" The boy's lip  trembled. Then he went on: \"And she thought perhaps you might have some  medicine, and--\"    \"But what is the matter, Ranald?\"    \"He was hurted bad--and he is not right wise in his head.\"    \"But how was he hurt?\"    Ranald hesitated.    \"I was not there--I am thinking it was something that struck him.\"    \"Ah, a tree! But where did the tree strike him?\"    \"Here,\" pointing to his breast; \"and it is sore in his breathing.\"    \"Well, Ranald, if you put the saddle on Pony, I shall be ready in a  minute.\"    Jessie was indignant.    \"You will not stir a foot this night. You will send some medicine, and  then you can go in the morning.\"    But the minister's wife heeded her not.    \"You are not walking, Ranald?\"    \"No, I have the colt.\"    \"Oh, that's splendid. We'll have a fine gallop--that is, if the moon is  up.\"    \"Yes, it is just coming up,\" said Ranald, hurrying away to the stable  that he might escape Jessie's wrath and get the pony ready.    It was no unusual thing for the minister and his wife to be called upon  to do duty for doctor and nurse. The doctor was twenty miles away. So  Mrs. Murray got into her riding-habit, threw her knitted hood over her  head, put some simple medicines into her hand-bag, and in ten minutes  was waiting for Ranald at the door.        CHAPTER IV    THE RIDE FOR LIFE      The night was clear, with a touch of frost in the air, yet with the  feeling in it of approaching spring. A dim light fell over the forest  from the half-moon and the stars, and seemed to fill up the little  clearing in which the manse stood, with a weird and mysterious radiance.  Far away in the forest the long-drawn howl of a wolf rose and fell, and  in a moment sharp and clear came an answer from the bush just at hand.  Mrs. Murray dreaded the wolves, but she was no coward and scorned to  show fear.    \"The wolves are out, Ranald,\" she said, carelessly, as Ranald came up  with the pony.    \"They are not many, I think,\" answered the boy as carelessly; \"but--are  you--do you think--perhaps I could just take the medicine--and you will  come--\"    \"Nonsense, Ranald! bring up the pony. Do you think I have lived all this  time in Indian Lands to be afraid of a wolf?\"    \"Indeed, you are not afraid, I know that well!\" Ranald shrank from  laying the crime of being afraid at the door of the"]]]
