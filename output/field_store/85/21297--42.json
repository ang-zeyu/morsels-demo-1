But days and weeks have  passed since it has filled me utterly, it has overflown into my  unconscious self, it accompanies me wherever I go, it broods above all  my commonplace conversation, it peeps over my shoulder at the comical  little journalistic work which I must carry out. It disturbs and  intoxicates me.\"    Then suddenly the storm breaks upon him. The clouds open, the thunder  rolls and the lightning flashes about him. A thousand impressions beat  upon him simultaneously, a gigantic vision. He cannot think, he cannot  act, he can only write; breathless, unreflecting, unable to control  himself, unable to exercise the critical faculty lest he dam the  eruption, he dashes down his thoughts on scraps of paper--\"Walking,  standing, lying down, in the street, at table, in the night,\" as if  under unceasing command.    And then doubts rise up from the depths. He dines with well-to-do,  educated, oppressed people who confront the question of anti-Semitism  in a state of complete helplessness: \"They do not suspect it, but they  are ghetto-natures, quiet, decent, timid. That is what most of us are.  Will they understand the call to freedom and to manhood? When I left  them my spirits were very low. Again, my plan appeared to me to be  crazy.\" Then at once he comes to \"Today I am again as firm as steel.\"  He notes the next morning. \"The flabbiness of the people I met  yesterday gives me all the more grounds for action.\"    Clearer and clearer becomes the picture which he has of himself and of  his task in the history of his people. \"I picked up once again the  torn thread of the tradition of our people. I lead it into the  Promised Land.\"    \"The Promised Land, where we can have hooked noses, black or red  beards, and bow legs, without being despised for it; where we can live  at last as free men on our own soil, and where we can die peacefully  in our own fatherland. There we can expect the award of honor for  great deeds, so that the offensive cry of 'Jew!' may become an  honorable appellation, like German, Englishman, Frenchman--in brief,  like all civilized peoples; so that we may be able to form our state  to educate our people for the tasks which at present still lie beyond  our vision. For surely God would not have kept us alive so long if  there were not assigned to us a specific role in the history of  mankind.\" He adds: \"The Jewish state is a world need.\" He draws the  logical consequence for himself: \"I believe that for me life has ended  and world history begun.\"    He let the first storm pass over him, yielding to its imperious will,  making no effort to stem its fury lest he interrupt the inspiration.  When it had had its way with him, he took hold of himself again, and  gathered up his energies for the effort to reconstruct everything  logically and in ordered fashion. He was afraid that death might come  upon him before he had succeeded in reducing to transferable form his  historic vision. Thus, in the course of five days, he added to his  diary a sixty-five page pamphlet--in effect the outline of _Der  Judenstaat_--which he called: _Address to the Rothschilds_.    In the address he writes, \"I have the solution to the Jewish question.  I know it sounds mad; and at the beginning I shall be called mad more  than once--until the truth of what I am saying is recognized in all  its shattering force.\"    He wrote to Bismarck asking for an interview in order to submit his  plan for a solution to the Jewish problem but he received no reply.    He wrote to Rabbi Gudemann, Chief Rabbi of Vienna, the occasion being  the anti-Jewish excesses which had occurred in Vienna. \"This plan ...  is a reserve against more evil days.\"    Herzl, in his first visit to England, met and talked with Israel  Zangwill, the novelist, whom he impressed without quite winning him  over. But Zangwill made it possible for him to meet more than a few  prominent, influential Jews of whom he made immediate converts. None  of them wanted to know anything about the Argentine, and on this point  the practical men were united with the dreamers: Palestine alone came  into the picture for a national concentration of the Jews.    After his experiences in England, Herzl resolved to present his plan  to the public at large. The _Address to the Rothschilds_ which was the  first complete writing of his plan, forged in the heat of inspiration  was thoroughly reworked and emerged as his great book _Der  Judenstaat_. Its title was: _The Jewish State: An Attempt at a Modern  Solution of the Jewish Problem. Der Judenstaat_ may properly be called  Herzl's life work; his philosophy of the world, his views on the  state, on the Jewish people, on science and technology, as we have  seen them developing to this, his thirty-fifth year are concentrated  in the book.    The \"Jewish State\" was published in an edition of three thousand. It  was read by small circles in various European capitals. It was sent to  leading personalities in the press and political circles. It was soon  translated into several languages. Herzl received many letters from  authors and statesmen in which the work was praised. But the general  German press, especially the Jewish-controlled press, took a negative  attitude. A number of journalists alluded to the adventurer who would  like to become Prime Minister or King of the Jews. No mention of the  \"Jewish State\" appeared in the Neue Freie Presse, then or ever. The  Algemeine Zeitung of Vienna said that Zionism was a madness born of  despair, The Algemeine Zeitung of Munich described it as a fantastic  dream of a feuilletonist whose mind had been unhinged by Jewish  enthusiasm.    It was upon the Jewish masses that Herzl made a tremendous impression.  He dawned upon Jews of Eastern Europe as a mystic figure rising out of  the past. Little was known of his pamphlet, for it was kept out of the  country by censorship in Russia. Only its title got their attention  and the stories told of Herzl--the Western Jew returning to his  people--gripped their hearts and stirred their imagination. He was  greeted by one of the Galician Zionist societies as the leader who,  like Moses, had returned from Midian to liberate the Jews. Max Nordau,  that devastating critic of art and literature, was swept off his feet  and described the pamphlet as a revelation, Richard Beer Hoffman, the  poet, wrote to Herzl saying \"At last there comes again a man, who does  not carry his Judaism with resignation as if it were a burden or a  misfortune, but is proud to be the legal heir of an immemorial  culture.\"    It became clear to Herzl that he would have to take an active part in  the task he had set forth in \"The Jewish State.\" He no longer felt  that he stood alone. He was not inclined to appear on a public  platform. He had the shyness of the man who had always written what he  had to say. He also felt that it would do more harm than good if his  ideas were to be obscured by his personal presence. Through  correspondence he set in motion Zionist activities--in London, in  Paris, in Berlin, in the United States. The amount of letter-writing  he developed was enormous.    He decided that there were three tasks to be undertaken at once. The  first was the organization of the Society of Jews. The second was to  continue diplomatic work in Constantinople and among interested  Powers. The third was the creation of a press to influence public  opinion and to prepare the Jewish masses for the great migration.    Through the Rev. Hechler, a chaplain of the British Embassy in Vienna,  who believed in the Jewish return to the Holy Land, Herzl was  introduced to the Grand Duke of Baden, a Christian of great piety and  influence in political circles.    Herzl intended to use the influence of the Germans to affect the  Sultan and make him more sympathetic to Zionist proposals. Herzl told  the Grand Duke that he would like to have Zionism included within the  cultural sphere of German interests. The Grand Duke said that the  Kaiser seemed inclined to take Jewish migration under German  protection. The great powers were interested in maintaining certain  extra territorial rights within the Turkish Empire. If they had  nationals in any part of the Empire, they claimed the right to protect  them over and above Turkish law. It was, therefore, not the Kaiser's  interest in the Jews, but in extending German jurisdiction within the  Turkish Empire that persuaded him to suggest the adoption of Jews in  Palestine for that purpose. Germany had a special relationship to  Turkey. Most of the western powers were openly discussing the  impending partition of the Turkish Empire, but Germany was opposed to  it.    Herzl was told that the Kaiser was prepared to see him at the head of  a delegation when he visited Palestine, but Herzl was anxious to see  the Kaiser without delay. He suggested an audience before the trip to  Palestine in order that the Kaiser might be in a position to discuss  the Jewish question with the Sultan. The Grand Duke advised Herzl to  see Count Philip Zu Eulenberg, the German Ambassador at Vienna. Herzl  was given an opportunity to see Count Eulenberg in Vienna. Herzl told  him that he wanted His Imperial Majesty to persuade the Sultan to open  negotiations with the Jews.    The Count passed Herzl over to the German Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Von Buelow, who happened to be in Vienna at the same time. Van Buelow  knew a great deal about the Zionist movement. He said that the  difficulty lay in persuading the Sultan to deal with the Jews. He felt  certain that the Sultan could be impressed if he was properly advised  by the Kaiser. A week later Herzl was informed of the Kaiser's  inclination to take the Jews of Palestine under his protection, and  repeated that he would like to see Herzl at the head of a delegation  in Jerusalem, later on.    Herzl was afraid of going further in this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#6)"],[1,"phenomena, that is, identical in       every respect but one-that of awareness in which sometimes       we are aware of these conscious phenomena and sometimes       not\"(p. 87 of \"Subconscious Phenomena,\" by various authors,       Rebman). Dr. Morton Price conceives that there may be       \"consciousness\" without \"awareness.\" But this is a difficult       view, and one which makes some definition of \"consciousness\"       imperative. For nay part, I cannot see how to separate       consciousness from awareness.    What, I think, is clearly established, is that a man's actions and  beliefs may be wholly dominated by a desire of which he is quite  unconscious, and which he indignantly repudiates when it is suggested  to him. Such a desire is generally, in morbid cases, of a sort which  the patient would consider wicked; if he had to admit that he had the  desire, he would loathe himself. Yet it is so strong that it must force  an outlet for itself; hence it becomes necessary to entertain whole  systems of false beliefs in order to hide the nature of what is desired.  The resulting delusions in very many cases disappear if the hysteric or  lunatic can be made to face the facts about himself. The consequence  of this is that the treatment of many forms of insanity has grown more  psychological and less physiological than it used to be. Instead of  looking for a physical defect in the brain, those who treat delusions  look for the repressed desire which has found this contorted mode  of expression. For those who do not wish to plunge into the somewhat  repulsive and often rather wild theories of psychoanalytic pioneers, it  will be worth while to read a little book by Dr. Bernard Hart on \"The  Psychology of Insanity.\"* On this question of the mental as opposed to  the physiological study of the causes of insanity, Dr. Hart says:         * Cambridge, 1912; 2nd edition, 1914. The following       references are to the second edition.    \"The psychological conception [of insanity] is based on the view that  mental processes can be directly studied without any reference to the  accompanying changes which are presumed to take place in the brain, and  that insanity may therefore be properly attacked from the standpoint of  psychology\"(p. 9).    This illustrates a point which I am anxious to make clear from the  outset. Any attempt to classify modern views, such as I propose to  advocate, from the old standpoint of materialism and idealism, is only  misleading. In certain respects, the views which I shall be setting  forth approximate to materialism; in certain others, they approximate to  its opposite. On this question of the study of delusions, the practical  effect of the modern theories, as Dr. Hart points out, is emancipation  from the materialist method. On the other hand, as he also points  out (pp. 38-9), imbecility and dementia still have to be considered  physiologically, as caused by defects in the brain. There is no  inconsistency in this If, as we maintain, mind and matter are neither of  them the actual stuff of reality, but different convenient groupings of  an underlying material, then, clearly, the question whether, in regard  to a given phenomenon, we are to seek a physical or a mental cause, is  merely one to be decided by trial. Metaphysicians have argued endlessly  as to the interaction of mind and matter. The followers of Descartes  held that mind and matter are so different as to make any action of the  one on the other impossible. When I will to move my arm, they said,  it is not my will that operates on my arm, but God, who, by His  omnipotence, moves my arm whenever I want it moved. The modern doctrine  of psychophysical parallelism is not appreciably different from this  theory of the Cartesian school. Psycho-physical parallelism is the  theory that mental and physical events each have causes in their own  sphere, but run on side by side owing to the fact that every state of  the brain coexists with a definite state of the mind, and vice versa.  This view of the reciprocal causal independence of mind and matter has  no basis except in metaphysical theory.* For us, there is no necessity  to make any such assumption, which is very difficult to harmonize with  obvious facts. I receive a letter inviting me to dinner: the letter is  a physical fact, but my apprehension of its meaning is mental. Here we  have an effect of matter on mind. In consequence of my apprehension of  the meaning of the letter, I go to the right place at the right time;  here we have an effect of mind on matter. I shall try to persuade you,  in the course of these lectures, that matter is not so material and mind  not so mental as is generally supposed. When we are speaking of matter,  it will seem as if we were inclining to idealism; when we are speaking  of mind, it will seem as if we were inclining to materialism. Neither  is the truth. Our world is to be constructed out of what the American  realists call \"neutral\" entities, which have neither the hardness and  indestructibility of matter, nor the reference to objects which is  supposed to characterize mind.         * It would seem, however, that Dr. Hart accepts this theory       as 8 methodological precept. See his contribution to       \"Subconscious Phenomena\" (quoted above), especially pp. 121-2.    There is, it is true, one objection which might be felt, not indeed to  the action of matter on mind, but to the action of mind on matter. The  laws of physics, it may be urged, are apparently adequate to explain  everything that happens to matter, even when it is matter in a man's  brain. This, however, is only a hypothesis, not an established theory.  There is no cogent empirical reason for supposing that the laws  determining the motions of living bodies are exactly the same as those  that apply to dead matter. Sometimes, of course, they are clearly the  same. When a man falls from a precipice or slips on a piece of orange  peel, his body behaves as if it were devoid of life. These are the  occasions that make Bergson laugh. But when a man's bodily movements  are what we call \"voluntary,\" they are, at any rate prima facie, very  different in their laws from the movements of what is devoid of life.  I do not wish to say dogmatically that the difference is irreducible;  I think it highly probable that it is not. I say only that the study of  the behaviour of living bodies, in the present state of our knowledge,  is distinct from physics. The study of gases was originally quite  distinct from that of rigid bodies, and would never have advanced to its  present state if it had not been independently pursued. Nowadays both  the gas and the rigid body are manufactured out of a more primitive and  universal kind of matter. In like manner, as a question of methodology,  the laws of living bodies are to be studied, in the first place, without  any undue haste to subordinate them to the laws of physics. Boyle's law  and the rest had to be discovered before the kinetic theory of gases  became possible. But in psychology we are hardly yet at the stage  of Boyle's law. Meanwhile we need not be held up by the bogey of  the universal rigid exactness of physics. This is, as yet, a mere  hypothesis, to be tested empirically without any preconceptions. It may  be true, or it may not. So far, that is all we can say.    Returning from this digression to our main topic, namely, the criticism  of \"consciousness,\" we observe that Freud and his followers, though they  have demonstrated beyond dispute the immense importance of \"unconscious\"  desires in determining our actions and beliefs, have not attempted the  task of telling us what an \"unconscious\" desire actually is, and have  thus invested their doctrine with an air of mystery and mythology which  forms a large part of its popular attractiveness. They speak always as  though it were more normal for a desire to be conscious, and as though  a positive cause had to be assigned for its being unconscious. Thus  \"the unconscious\" becomes a sort of underground prisoner, living in a  dungeon, breaking in at long intervals upon our daylight respectability  with dark groans and maledictions and strange atavistic lusts. The  ordinary reader, almost inevitably, thinks of this underground person as  another consciousness, prevented by what Freud calls the \"censor\" from  making his voice heard in company, except on rare and dreadful occasions  when he shouts so loud that every one hears him and there is a scandal.  Most of us like the idea that we could be desperately wicked if only we  let ourselves go. For this reason, the Freudian \"unconscious\" has been a  consolation to many quiet and well-behaved persons.    I do not think the truth is quite so picturesque as this. I believe an  \"unconscious\" desire is merely a causal law of our behaviour,* namely,  that we remain restlessly active until a certain state of affairs is  realized, when we achieve temporary equilibrium If we know beforehand  what this state of affairs is, our desire is conscious; if not,  unconscious. The unconscious desire is not something actually existing,  but merely a tendency to a certain behaviour; it has exactly the same  status as a force in dynamics. The unconscious desire is in no way  mysterious; it is the natural primitive form of desire, from which the  other has developed through our habit of observing and theorizing (often  wrongly). It is not necessary to suppose, as Freud seems to do,  that every unconscious wish was once conscious, and was then, in his  terminology, \"repressed\" because we disapproved of it. On the contrary,  we shall suppose that, although Freudian \"repression\" undoubtedly occurs  and is important, it is not the usual reason for unconsciousness of our  wishes. The usual reason is merely that wishes are all, to begin with,  unconscious, and only become known when they are actively noticed.  Usually, from laziness, people do not notice, but accept"]]]
