TURNER'S DENIAL.    _A London cable dispatch of June 15 to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _said:_    At the opening of the Court of Inquiry today into the torpedoing of  the steamship Lusitania on May 7, two outstanding points were vividly  impressed. One was that the Cunarder was unarmed. The other was that  the ship was proceeding at reduced speed, eighteen knots an hour, only  nineteen of her twenty-five boilers being used, the result of her  effort to save in coal and labor.    Sir Edward Carson, the Attorney General, in outlining the evidence in  the hands of the Crown, adverted impressively to President Wilson's  note to Germany on the sinking of the Lusitania in which the President  informed the German Government that it was wrong in assuming that the  Lusitania was equipped with masked guns and manned by trained gunners.  \"We have ample evidence to disprove the German lie that the Lusitania  was armed,\" said the Attorney General. \"Aside from the word of  witnesses we have that of President Wilson in his recent note to  Germany, based upon investigation made by officials under him. The  sinking of the Lusitania was murder.\"    Sir Edward lifted a newspaper clipping of the President's note from  the table and slowly read the passage disposing of the German  allegation that the Lusitania was an armed auxiliary.    Captain W.T. Turner, who seemed slightly grayer than before the  Lusitania was torpedoed, in that way alone showing the strain under  which he has been since his ship was sunk under him, gave evidence  that there was not one gun on the Lusitania's deck, and declared that  the German assertion that the steamer was armed was a \"sheer lie.\"    [Illustration: CAPTAIN WILLIAM T. TURNER, R.N.R.    Commander of the R.M.S. _Lusitania_    (_Photo from Underwood & Underwood_)]      STAHL INDICTED FOR PERJURY.    _In_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _of June 19 appeared the following report of  the Grand Jury's indictment of Stahl on a charge of perjury and the  announcement that the Federal investigation will be continued:_    Gustav Stahl, the alleged German reservist, who made an affidavit that  he had seen guns on board the Lusitania on the day before she sailed  on her last voyage, was indicted on a charge of perjury by the Federal  Grand Jury yesterday. The perjury charge is based on his testimony  before the Grand Jury, during which examination he repeated that he  had seen the guns on the Lusitania as set forth in his affidavit filed  by the German Embassy in Washington and now in the hands of the State  Department.    The name of Paul Koenig, who, it is said, was known to Stahl as  Stemler, and who is the chief of the secret service of the  Hamburg-American Line, is mentioned by name in the indictment. The  indictment sets forth that on June 10 there was pending before the  Grand Jury an investigation concerning Koenig and others and that  Stahl was among the witnesses called in the course of that  investigation. It then goes on to say that Stahl testified in  substance and to the effect that on April 30 he went aboard the  Lusitania, then with one Leach, and that while on the vessel he saw  four guns on one of the decks of the steamship, two forward and two  aft, and all mounted on wooden blocks and covered with leather. The  indictment further charges that at the time of so swearing Stahl did  not believe it to be true that he had been on board the Lusitania and  had seen the four guns.    The indictment, in conclusion, charges that there were no guns upon  the decks of the Lusitania on April 30. \"Therefore,\" the Grand Jury  charges, \"that Stahl, after taking an oath before a competent officer  to truly depose and testify, did willfully, knowingly and feloniously  and contrary to his said oath, depose and state material matters which  were not true and which he did not then believe to be true, and  thereby did commit willful and corrupt perjury against the peace of  the United States and their dignity and contrary to the form of the  statute of the United States in such cases made and provided.\"    Stahl will be arraigned before Judge Russell in the criminal branch of  the United States District Court on Monday. He is now in the Tombs in  default of $10,000 bail. Should he be convicted of perjury he may be  sentenced to prison for five years or fined $10,000, or both.    The indictment of Stahl does not mean that the Government's  investigation of the Lusitania affidavits, and the way in which they  were procured, is at an end. On the other hand it is proceeding  vigorously. Three witnesses, all Government officials, were before the  Grand Jury yesterday in connection with the case. Heinz Hardenberg,  who was found in Cincinnati a week ago today and brought here to be  examined by the Grand Jury, has not yet appeared before that body,  although the Government agents insist they can produce him when his  testimony is desired.      THE NEBRASKAN CASE.    _An Associated Press dispatch dated at London on May 26, 1915,  reported:_    The American steamer Nebraskan, Captain Greene, from Liverpool May 24  for Delaware Breakwater, was torpedoed yesterday evening by a  submarine at a point forty miles west-southwest of Fastnet, off the  south coast of Ireland. [Captain Greene's report, given below, says  the Nebraskan was \"struck by either mine or torpedo.\"]    The sea was calm at the time. The crew at once took to the boats and  stood by the steamer. It was soon ascertained that the Nebraskan was  not seriously damaged, but she had been struck forward, and her  foreholds were full of water.    The crew returned on board and got the vessel under way. No lives were  lost among the crew. The Nebraskan did not carry any passengers.    This information was received at the British Admiralty in London, and  it was at once communicated to the American Embassy.    Immediately she was struck the Nebraskan began calling for help by  wireless. Brow Head received the wireless communication at 9 P.M.  yesterday from Crookhaven.    A message to Lloyd's from Kinsale, Ireland, says that the Nebraskan  passed that point at 11 o'clock this morning. She was down at the  bows, but was proceeding under her own steam, and flying the signal:  \"I am not under control.\"    The vessel passed Queenstown in the afternoon on the way to Liverpool.  She was proceeding at eight knots.    A message to The Star from Liverpool says that the name and  nationality of the Nebraskan were painted in large letters on her  sides. She was in water ballast.    A message to Lloyd's says that an armed trawler went to the assistance  of the Nebraskan and stood by her all night.    The report that the Nebraskan had been torpedoed caused surprise to  American officials here. Apparently the affair occurred before 9  o'clock last night.    Last evening was clear, and the period between 8 and 9 o'clock is the  twilight hour in the British islands at this season.    The German submarine campaign is continuing actively. Dispatches from  Norway state that the people of that country have been aroused by the  sinking last week of the Norwegian steamer Minerva and the attempt to  torpedo the Iris, which went to her assistance.    The steamer Cromer, loaded with passengers, had a narrow escape from  being torpedoed while bound for Rotterdam yesterday. A submarine fired  a torpedo without warning. It missed the ship by only fifteen yards.  According to the Captain's story, told to Rotterdam correspondents,  the periscope was seen 500 yards distant, and then the wash of the  torpedo, which was moving so rapidly that nothing could be done to  avoid it. The attack occurred at a point four miles north of North  Hinder Lightship.    _The first news of the Nebraskan having been disabled off the  southwest coast of Ireland was received on May 26, at the office of  the American-Hawaiian Line in a message from the Captain, which read:_    Struck by either mine or torpedo, forty-eight miles west of Fastnet.  Am steaming under convoy to Liverpool. Water in lower hold. No one  injured.    GREENE.    [Illustration: Map indicating sites of attacks on American ships or  American lives in the German submarine war zone. The damage to the  Nebraskan was sustained on May 25, last.]    _Three dispatches concerning the Nebraskan incident were received at  the State Department at Washington on May 26--one from Walter H.  Page, the American Ambassador in London, and two from Robert P.  Skinner, the United States Consul General in London. The dispatch from  the Ambassador said:_    Urgent. Report at midnight last night to British Admiralty from Lands  End states that American steamer Nebraskan torpedoed forty-five miles  south by west of Southcliffe, crew taking to boats. British trawler  standing by now reports Nebraskan still afloat and making for  Liverpool with four holds full of water. No lives reported lost.    _The first dispatch from Consul General Skinner was as follows:_    Admiralty reports American steamer Nebraskan, Liverpool for Delaware  Breakwater, torpedoed forty miles south by west of Fastnet.

When the Romans had taken possession of Pergamon, those who had charge of  the city would become familiar with the library; and it seems to me almost  certain that, when the necessity for establishing a public library at Rome  had been recognised, the splendid structure at Pergamon would be turned to  as a model. But, if I mistake not, Roman architecture had received an  influence from Pergamon long before this event occurred. What this was I  will mention presently.    No public library was established in Rome until the reign of Augustus.  Julius Caesar had intended to build one on the largest possible scale, and  had gone so far as to commission Varro to collect books for it[26]; but it  was reserved for C. Asinius Pollio, general, lawyer, orator, poet, the  friend of Virgil and Horace, to devote to this purpose the spoils he had  obtained in his Illyrian campaign, B.C. 39. In the striking words of Pliny  \"he was the first to make men's talents public property (_ingenia hominum  rem publicam fecit_)\" The same writer tells us that he also introduced the  fashion of decorating libraries with busts of departed authors, and that  Varro was the only living writer whose portrait was admitted[27]. Pollio  is further credited, by Suetonius, with having built an _atrium  libertatis_[28], in which Isidore, a writer of the seventh century,  probably quoting a lost work of Suetonius, places the library, with the  additional information, that the collection contained Greek as well as  Latin books[29].    The work of Pollio is recorded among the acts of generosity which Augustus  suggested to others. But before long the emperor turned his own attention  to libraries, and enriched his capital with two splendid structures which  may be taken as types of Roman libraries,--the library of Apollo on the  Palatine Hill, and that in the Campus Martius called after Octavia, sister  to the emperor. I will take the latter first.    The _Porticus Octaviae_, or, as it was sometimes called, the _Opera  Octaviae_, must have been one of the most magnificent structures in Rome  (fig. 3). It stood in the Campus Martius, near the Theatre of Marcellus,  between the Capitoline Hill and the Tiber. A double colonnade surrounded  an area which measured 443 feet by 377 feet, with _Jani_, or four-faced  archways, at the four corners, and on the side next the Tiber a double  hexastyle porch, which, with a few fragments of the colonnade, still  exists in a fairly good state of preservation[30]. Within this space were  two temples, one of Jupiter, the other of Juno, a _curia_ or hall, in  which the Senate frequently met, a _schola_ or \"Conversation Hall[31],\"  and two libraries, the one of Greek, the other of Latin books. The area  and buildings were crowded with masterpieces in bronze and marble.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Plan of the Porticus Octaviae, Rome. From _Formae  Urbis Romae Antiqua_, Berlin, 1896.]    This structure was originally built by Quintus Metellus, about 146  B.C.[32]. One of the temples was due to his own liberality, the other had  been erected by Domitius Lepidus, B.C. 179. Now twenty years before,  Metellus had fought in a successful campaign against Perseus king of  Macedonia, in which the Romans had been assisted by Eumenes II.: and in  B.C. 148, as Praetor, he received Macedonia as his province. Is it not  possible that on one or other of these occasions he may have visited  Pergamon, and, when designing his buildings in Rome, have copied what he  had seen there? Again, in B.C. 157, Crates of Mallus, a distinguished  grammarian, was sent from Pergamon as ambassador to Rome, and, being laid  up there by an accident, gave lectures on grammar, in the course of which  he could hardly have failed to mention the new library[33].    The buildings of Metellus were altered, if not entirely rebuilt, by  Augustus, B.C. 33, out of the proceeds of his victorious campaign against  the Dalmatians; with the additional structures above enumerated. The  _schola_ is believed to have stood behind the temples, and the libraries  behind the _schola_, with the _curia_ between them[34]. Thus the  colonnades, which Metellus had restricted to the two temples, came at last  to serve the double purpose for which they were originally intended in  connexion with a library as well as with a temple.    The temple and area of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, which Augustus began  B.C. 36 and dedicated B.C. 28, exhibit an arrangement precisely similar to  that of the Porticus Octaviae. The size was nearly the same[35], and the  structures included in the area were intended to serve the same purposes.  The temple stood in the middle of a large open peristyle, connected with  which were two libraries, one for Greek, the other for Latin books; and  between them, used perhaps as a reading-room or vestibule, was a hall in  which Augustus occasionally convened the Senate. It contained a colossal  statue of Apollo, made of gilt bronze; and on its walls were  portrait-reliefs of celebrated writers, in the form of medallions, in the  same material[36].    Of the other public libraries of Rome--of which there are said to have  been in all twenty-six--I need mention only three as possessing some  peculiarity to which I shall have to draw attention. Of these the first  was established by Tiberius in his palace, at no great distance from the  library of Apollo; the second and third by Vespasian and Trajan in their  Fora, connected in the one with the temple of Peace, and in the other with  the temple dedicated in honour of Trajan himself.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Plan of the Forum of Trajan; after Nibby.]    Of the first two of these libraries we have no information; but in the  case of the third we are more fortunate. The Forum of Trajan (fig. 4) was  excavated by order of Napoleon I., and the extent of its buildings, with  their relation to one another, is therefore known with approximate  accuracy. The Greek and Latin libraries stood to the right and left of the  small court between the _Basilica Ulpia_ and the _Templum Divi Trajani_,  the centre of which was marked by the existing Column. They were entered  from this court, each through a portico of five inter-columniations. The  rooms, measured internally, were about 60 feet long, by 45 feet broad.    At this point I must mention, parenthetically, the library built by  Hadrian at Athens. Pausanias records it in the following passage:        Hadrian also built for the Athenians a temple of Hera      and Panhellenian Zeus, and a sanctuary common to all the      gods. But most splendid of all are one hundred columns;      walls and colonnades alike are made of Phrygian marble.      Here, too, is a building adorned with a gilded roof and      alabaster and also with statues and paintings: books are      stored in it. There is also a gymnasium named after      Hadrian; it too has one hundred columns from the      quarries of Libya[37].    A building called the Stoa of Hadrian, a ground-plan of which (fig. 5) I  borrow from Miss Harrison's _Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens_,  has been identified with part at least of that which Pausanias describes  in the above passage. A lofty wall, built of large square blocks of  Pentelic marble, faced on the west side by a row of Corinthian columns,  enclosed a quadrangular court, measuring 328 feet from east to west, by  250 feet from north to south. This court, entered through a sort of  propylaea on the west side (N), was surrounded by a cloister or colonnade  27 feet wide, and containing 100 columns. None of those columns are  standing, but their number can be accurately calculated from the marks of  the bases still to be seen on the eastern side of the quadrangle.    Within this area are the remains of a building of uncertain use, and at  present only partially excavated.    On the east side a row of five chambers, of which that in the centre was  the largest, opened off from the colonnade[38].    [Illustration: Fig. 5. Plan of the Stoa of Hadrian, at Athens.      AE, KI. Pier-arcade of the medieval church of the Panagia.    B. North-east angle of this church, of Roman work.    B, C, D, F. Portions of the Roman building which preceded the church.    L, M. Reservoirs.    N. Propylaea through which the court was entered.    ]    If the ground plan of this structure (fig. 5) be compared with that of the  precinct of Athena and library at Pergamon (fig. 2), a striking similarity  between them will at once be recognised; and, whatever may have been the  destination of the building within the cloistered area, there can, I  think, be little doubt that the library was contained in the five rooms  beyond its limits to the east. They must have been entered from the  cloister, much as those at Pergamon were. It is possible that Hadrian may  himself have visited Pergamon, for Trajan had built an imperial residence  there; but, even if he did not do this, he would accept the type from the  great libraries built at Rome by Augustus. It should be mentioned that S.  Jerome specially commemorates this library among Hadrian's works at  Athens, and says that it was of remarkable construction (_miri  operis_)[39].    From this brief digression I return to the public libraries of Rome. In  the first place those built by Augustus had a regular organisation. There  appears to have been a general director called _Procurator Bibliothecarum  Augusti_[40]; and subordinate officers for each division: that is to say,  one for the Greek books, one for the Latin books. These facts are derived  from inscriptions found in _Columbaria_. Secondly, it may be concluded  that they were used not merely for reading and reference, but as  meeting-places for literary men.    The Palatine libraries evidently contained a large collection of old and  new books; and I think it is quite certain that new books, as soon as  published, were "]]]
