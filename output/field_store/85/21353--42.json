Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws  and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of  that government.  Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign  power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.  Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is  guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.  Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained  by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a  system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.  Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the  body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives  responsible to them.  Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).  Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.  Federal (Federative) - a form of government in which sovereign power is  formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of  its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central  government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as  upon the regional units.  Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central  government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,  colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate  sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental  representatives.  Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China  by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution  is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch  with the people.  Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by  19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as  a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class  struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists  (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"  to, finally, a classless society - communism.  Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin  from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage  of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed  to underdeveloped countries.  Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the  hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for  life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute  ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with  constitutionally limited authority.  Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group  of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.  Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the legislature  (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or  chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party  strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government  acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the  parliament.  Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a  government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its  leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to  their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly  responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by  the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the  leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer  function.  Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -  a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a  legislature (parliament).  Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected  deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on  legislation.  Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and  distributing goods is controlled by a central government that  theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property  and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being  no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.  Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);  the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.  Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the  supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government  subject to religious authority.  Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to  the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters,  but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.

The adult prevalence rate is calculated by  dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend  by the total adult population at yearend.    HIV/AIDS - deaths  This entry gives an estimate of the number of adults and children who  died of AIDS during a given calendar year.    HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS  This entry gives an estimate of all people (adults and children) alive  at yearend with HIV infection, whether or not they have developed  symptoms of AIDS.    Heliports  This entry gives the total number of heliports with hard-surface  runways, helipads, or landing areas that support routine sustained  helicopter operations exclusively and have support facilities including  one or more of the following facilities: lighting, fuel, passenger  handling, or maintenance. It includes former airports used exclusively  for helicopter operations but excludes heliports limited to day  operations and natural clearings that could support helicopter landings  and takeoffs.    Highways  This entry states the total length of the highway system and the length  of the paved and unpaved parts.    Household income or consumption by percentage share  Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different  standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys  based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than  surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with  time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country  comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes  see Data codes    Illicit drugs  This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs -  narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and  cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside of medical channels.  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).  Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the  stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,  which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,  and cocoa butter.  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).  Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.  Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.  Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-  awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants  (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine  analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.  Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.  Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).  Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in  Southwest Asia and Africa.  Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to  opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics  include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],[0,"Vaninka (#6)"],[1," where they were not merited. Foedor was returning,  as he had promised, worthy of his noble protector's friendship, and who  knows, perhaps worthy of Vaninka's love. Field-Marshal Souvarow had made  a friend of him, and none could know to what this friendship might not  lead; for Paul honoured Souvarow like one of the ancient heroes.    But no one could rely upon Paul, for his character was made up of  extreme impulses. Without having done anything to offend his master, and  without knowing the cause of his disgrace, Souvarow, on arriving at  Riga, received a private letter which informed him, in the emperor's  name, that, having tolerated an infraction of the laws of discipline  among his soldiers, the emperor deprived him of all the honours with  which he had been invested, and also forbade him to appear before him.    Such tidings fell like a thunderbolt upon the old warrior, already  embittered by his reverses: he was heart-broken that such storm-clouds  should tarnish the end of his glorious day.    In consequence of this order, he assembled all his officers in the  market-place of Riga, and took leave of them sorrowfully, like a father  taking leave of his family. Having embraced the generals and colonels,  and having shaken hands with the others, he said good-bye to them once  more, and left them free to continue their march to their destination.    Souvarow took a sledge, and, travelling night and day, arrived incognito  in the capital, which he was to have entered in triumph, and was driven  to a distant suburb, to the house of one of his nieces, where he died of  a broken heart fifteen days afterwards.    On his own account, Foedor travelled almost as rapidly as his general,  and entered St. Petersburg without having sent any letter to announce  his arrival. As he had no parent in the capital, and as his entire  existence was concentrated in one person, he drove direct to the  general's house, which was situated in the Prospect of Niewski, at an  angle of the Catherine Canal.    Having arrived there, he sprang out of his carriage, entered the  courtyard, and bounded up the steps. He opened the ante-chamber door,  and precipitated himself into the midst of the servants and subordinate  household officers. They cried out with surprise upon seeing him: he  asked them where the general was; they replied by pointing to the door  of the dining-room; he was in there, breakfasting with his daughter.    Then, through a strange reaction, Foedor felt his knees failing him, and  he was obliged to lean against a wall to prevent himself from falling.  At this moment, when he was about to see Vaninka again, this soul of his  soul, for whom alone he had done so much, he dreaded lest he should not  find her the same as when he had left her. Suddenly the dining-room door  opened, and Vaninka appeared. Seeing the young man, she uttered a cry,  and, turning to the general, said, \"Father, it is Foedor\"; and the  expression of her voice left no doubt of the sentiment which inspired  it.    \"Foedor!\" cried the general, springing forward and holding out his arms.    Foedor did not know whether to throw himself at the feet of Vaninka or  into the arms of her father. He felt that his first recognition ought to  be devoted to respect and gratitude, and threw himself into the  general's arms. Had he acted otherwise, it would have been an avowal of  his love, and he had no right to avow this love till he knew that it was  reciprocated.    Foedor then turned, and as at parting, sank on his knee before Vaninka;  but a moment had sufficed for the haughty girl to banish the feeling she  had shown. The blush which had suffused her cheek had disappeared, and  she had become again cold and haughty like an alabaster statue-a  masterpiece of pride begun by nature and finished by education. Foedor  kissed her hand; it was trembling but cold he felt his heart sink, and  thought he was about to die.    \"Why, Vaninka,\" said the general--\"why are you so cool to a friend who  has caused us so much anxiety and yet so much pleasure? Come, Fordor,  kiss my daughter.\"    Foedor rose entreatingly, but waited motionless, that another permission  might confirm that of the general.    \"Did you not hear my father?\" said Vaninka, smiling, but nevertheless  possessing sufficient self-control to prevent the emotion she was  feeling from appearing in her voice.    Foedor stooped to kiss Vaninka, and as he held her hands it seemed to  him that she lightly pressed his own with a nervous, involuntary  movement. A feeble cry of joy nearly escaped him, when, suddenly looking  at Vaninka, he was astonished at her pallor: her lips were as white as  death.    The general made Foedor sit down at the table: Vaninka took her place  again, and as by chance she was seated with her back to the light, the  general noticed nothing.    Breakfast passed in relating and listening to an account of this strange  campaign which began under the burning sun of Italy and ended in the  glaciers of Switzerland. As there are no journals in St. Petersburg  which publish anything other than that which is permitted by the  emperor, Souvarow's successes were spread abroad, but his reverses were  ignored. Foedor described the former with modesty and the latter with  frankness.    One can imagine, the immense interest the general took in Foedor's  story. His two captain's epaulets and the decorations on his breast  proved that the young man had modestly suppressed his own part in the  story he had told. But the general, too courageous to fear that he might  share in Souvarow's disgrace, had already visited the dying  field-marshal, and had heard from him an account of his young protege's  bravery. Therefore, when Foedor had finished his story, it was the  general's turn to enumerate all the fine things Foedor had done in a  campaign of less than a year. Having finished this enumeration, he added  that he intended next day to ask the emperor's permission to take the  young captain for his aide-de-camp. Foedor hearing this wished to throw  himself at the general's feet, but he received him again in his arms,  and to show Foedor how certain he was that he would be successful in his  request, he fixed the rooms that the young man was to occupy in the  house at once.    The next day the general returned from the palace of St. Michel with the  pleasant news that his request had been granted.    Foedor was overwhelmed with joy: from this time he was to form part of  the general's family. Living under the same roof as Vaninka, seeing her  constantly, meeting her frequently in the rooms, seeing her pass like an  apparition at the end of a corridor, finding himself twice a day at the  same table with her, all this was more than Foedor had ever dared hope,  and he thought for a time that he had attained complete happiness.    For her part, Vaninka, although she was so proud, at the bottom of her  heart took a keen interest in Foedor. He had left her with the certainty  that he loved her, and during his absence her woman's pride had been  gratified by the glory he had acquired, in the hope of bridging the  distance which separated them. So that, when she saw him return with  this distance between them lessened, she felt by the beating of her  heart that gratified pride was changing into a more tender sentiment,  and that for her part she loved Foedor as much as it was possible for  her to love anyone.    She had nevertheless concealed these feelings under an appearance of  haughty indifference, for Vaninka was made so: she intended to let  Foedor know some day that she loved him, but until the time came when it  pleased her to reveal it, she did not wish the young man to discover her  love. Things went on in this way for several months, and the  circumstances which had at first appeared to Foedor as the height of  happiness soon became awful torture.    To love and to feel his heart ever on the point of avowing its love, to  be from morning till night in the company of the beloved one, to meet  her hand at the table, to touch her dress in a narrow corridor, to feel  her leaning on his arm when they entered a salon or left a ballroom,  always to have ceaselessly to control every word, look, or movement  which might betray his feelings, no human power could endure such a  struggle.    Vaninka saw that Foedor could not keep his secret much longer, and  determined to anticipate the avowal which she saw every moment on the  point of escaping his heart.    One day when they were alone, and she saw the hopeless efforts the young  man was making to hide his feelings from her, she went straight up to  him, and, looking at him fixedly, said:    \"You love me!\"    \"Forgive me, forgive me,\" cried the young man, clasping his hands.    \"Why should you ask me to forgive you, Foedor? Is not your love  genuine?\"    \"Yes, yes, genuine but hopeless.\"    \"Why hopeless? Does not my father love you as a son?\" said Vaninka.    \"Oh, what do you mean?\" cried Foedor. \"Do you mean that if your father  will bestow your hand upon me, that you will then consent--?\"    \"Are you not both noble in heart and by birth, Foedor? You are not  wealthy, it is true, but then I am rich enough for both.\"    \"Then I am not indifferent to you?\"    \"I at least prefer you to anyone else I have met.\"    \"Vaninka!\" The young girl drew herself away proudly.    \"Forgive me!\" said Foedor. \"What am I doing? You have but to order: I  have no wish apart from you. I dread lest I shall offend you. Tell me  what to do, and I will obey.\"    \"The first thing you must do, Foedor, is to ask my father's consent.\"    \"So you will allow me to take this step?\"    \"Yes, but on one condition.\"    \"What is it? Tell me.\"    \"My father, whatever his answer, must never know that I have consented  to your making this application to him; no one must know that you are  following my instructions; the world must remain ignorant of the  confession I have just made to you; and,"]]]
