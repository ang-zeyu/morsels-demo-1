I am  happy to say, however, that this was not true, and the only sensible  difference that we noticed was, that it was more crowded and hotter,  and that the price of admission was double.    This was the last corrida of the fiesta, and some of the best bulls had  been kept in reserve. The first that was dragged on was received with  acclamations, as having distinguished himself before during the fiesta;  but he bore an ugly mark for a favourite of the people, having been  dragged by the nose till the cartilage was completely torn out by the  rope.    The next would have been worthy of the best bull-fights of Old Spain,  when the cavalier, at the glance of his lady's eye, leaped into the  ring to play the matador with his sword. He was a large black bull,  without any particular marks of ferocity about him; but a man who sat  in our box, and for whose judgment I had conceived a great respect,  lighted a new straw cigar, and pronounced him \"_muy bravo_.\" There was  no bellowing, blustering, or bravado about him, but he showed a  calmness and self-possession which indicated a consciousness of  strength. The picadores attacked him on horseback, and, like the Noir  Faineant, or Sluggish Knight, in the lists at Ashby, for a time he  contented himself with merely repelling the attacks of his assailants;  but suddenly, as if a little vexed, he laid his head low, looked up at  the spears pointed at his neck, and, shutting his eyes, rushed upon a  picador on one side, struck his horse in the belly with his horns,  lifted him off his feet, and brought horse and rider headlong to the  ground. The horse fell upon the rider, rolled completely over him, with  his heels in the air, and rose with one of the rider's feet entangled  in the stirrup. For an instant he stood like a breathing statue, with  nostrils wide and ears thrown back, wild with fright; and then,  catching sight of the bull, he sprang clear of the ground, and dashed  off at full speed around the ring, dragging after him the luckless  picador. Around he went, senseless and helpless, his whole body grimed  with dirt, and with no more life in it, apparently, than in a mere log  of wood. At every bound it seemed as if the horse must strike his hind  hoofs into his forehead. A cold shudder ran through the spectators. The  man was a favourite; he had friends and relatives present, and  everybody knew his name. A deep murmur of \"_El Pobre_\" burst from every  bosom. I felt actually lifted from my seat, and the president of the  Life and Trust would not have given a policy upon him for any premium.  The picadores looked on aghast; the bull was roaming loose in the ring,  perhaps the only indifferent spectator. My own feelings were roused  against his companions, who, after what seemed an age of the rack,  keeping a special good lookout upon the bull, at length started in  pursuit with lazos, caught the horse around the neck, and brought him  up headlong. The picadores extricated their fallen companion, and  carried him out. His face was so begrimed with dirt that not a feature  was visible; but, as he was borne across the ring, he opened his eyes,  and they seemed starting from his head with terror.    He was hardly out of the ring when a hoarse cry ran through the  spectators, \"_a pie! a pie!_\" \"on foot! on foot!\" The picadores  dismounted and attacked the bull fiercely on foot, flourishing their  ponchas. Almost at the first thrust he rushed upon one of his  adversaries, tumbled him down, passed over his body, and walked on  without even turning round to look at him. He too was picked up and  carried off.    The attack was renewed, and the bull became roused. In a few moments he  brought another picador to the ground, and, carried on by his own  impetus, passed over the body, but, with a violent effort, recovered  himself, and turned short round upon his prostrate prey, glared over  him for a moment with a low bellow, almost a howl, and, raising his  fore feet a little from the ground, so as to give full force to the  blow, thrust both horns into the stomach of the fallen picador.  Happily, the points were sawed off; and, furious at not being able to  gore and toss him, he got one horn under the picador's sash, lifted  him, and dashed him back violently upon the ground. Accustomed as the  spectators were to scenes of this kind, there was a universal burst of  horror. Not a man moved to save him. It would, perhaps, be unjust to  brand them as cowards, for, brutal and degrading as their tie was, they  doubtless had a feeling of companionship; but, at all events, not a man  attempted to save him, and the bull, after glaring over him, smelling  and pawing him for a moment, to all a moment of intense excitement,  turned away and left him.    This man, too, was carried off. The sympathy of the spectators had for  a while kept them hushed; but, as soon as the man was out of sight, all  their pent-up feelings broke out in indignation against the bull, and  there was a universal cry, in which the soft tones of women mingled  with the hoarse voices of the men, \"_Matalo! matalo!_\" \"Kill him! kill  him!\" The picadores stood aghast. Three of their companions had been  struck down and carried off the field; the bull, pierced in several  places, with blood streaming from him, but fresh as when he began, and  fiercer, was roaming round the ring, and they held back, evidently  afraid to attack him. The spectators showered upon them, the  opprobrious name of \"_cobardes! cobardes!_\" \"cowards! cowards!\" The  dragoon enforced obedience to their voice, and, fortifying themselves  with a strong draught of agua ardiente, they once more faced the bull,  poised their spears before him, but with faint hands and trembling  hearts, and finally, without a single thrust, amid the contemptuous  shouts of the crowd, fell back, and left the bull master of the field.    Others were let in, and it was almost dark when the last fight ended.  With the last bull the ring was opened to the boys, who, amid roars of  laughter, pulled, hauled, and hustled him till he could hardly stand,  and, amid the solemn tones of the vesper bell, the bull-fight in honour  of San Cristoval ended.    Modern laws, we are told, have done much to abate the danger and  ferocity of bull-fights. The horns of the bull are sawed off, so that  he cannot gore, and spears are not allowed of more than a certain  length, so that the bull cannot be killed by a direct blow; but, in my  opinion, it would be really better for effect upon moral character that  a bullfight should be, as it once was, a battle for life between man  and beast, for then it was an exhibition of skill and daring, around  which were sometimes thrown the graces of chivalry. The danger to which  the man exposed himself, to a certain extent atoned for the barbarities  inflicted on the bull. Here for eight days bulls with blunted horns had  been stabbed, mangled, and tortured; many, no doubt, died of their  wounds, or were killed because they could not recover; and that day we  had seen four men struck down and carried off, two of whom had narrowly  escaped with their lives, if, indeed, they ever recovered. After the  immediate excitement of the danger, the men were less objects of  commiseration than the beasts, but the whole showed the still bloody  effects of this modified system of bull-fighting. Men go into all  places without shame, though not without reproach, but I am happy in  being able to say that none of what are called the higher classes of  the ladies of Merida were present. Still there were many whose young  and gentle faces did not convey the idea that they could find pleasure  in scenes of blood, even though but the blood of brutes.    In the evening we took another hot-bath at the loteria, and the next  day was Sunday, the last day of the fiesta, which opened in the morning  with grand mass in the church of San Cristoval. The great church, the  paintings and altars, the burning of incense, the music, the imposing  ceremonies of the altar, and the kneeling figures, inspired, as they  always do, if not a religious, at least a solemn feeling; and, as on  the occasion of grand mass in the Cathedral on my first visit to  Merida, among the kneeling figures of the women my eyes rested upon one  with a black mantle over her head, a prayer-book in her hand, and an  Indian woman by her side, whose face exhibited a purity and  intellectual softness which it was easy for the imagination to invest  with all those attributes that make woman perfect. Whether she was  maid, wife, or widow, I never learned.    At four o'clock in the afternoon we set out for the procession and  paseo. The intense heat of the day was over, there was shade in the  streets, and a fresh evening breeze. The streets through which the  procession was to pass were adorned with branches, and at the corners  were large collections of them, forming groves of green. The balconies  of the windows were hung with silk curtains and banners, and in the  doorways and along the walks sat rows of ladies simply but beautifully  dressed, without hats, their hair adorned with flowers, and their necks  with jewels. Near the church of San Cristoval we were arrested by the  crowd, and waited till the procession came up.    It was headed by three priests, all richly dressed, one supporting a  large silver cross ten feet high, and each of the others bearing a tall  silver candlestick. They were followed by an Indian band, a motley  group, the leaders of which were three Indians, one supporting the head  and another the foot of a large violoncello. Next came a party of  Indians, bearing on their shoulders a barrow supporting a large silver  cross. At the foot of the cross sat the figure of Mary Magdalen, large  as life, dressed in red. Over her head was a blue silk mantilla, with a  broad gold border, and across her lap the figure of the dead Christ.

He leaned over his saddle, questioning the men  and thanking them for their gallantry. I thought he looked grayer and  older than when he had addressed us.    \"Who mun that old geezer be, Jock?\" asked a Highlander when he had  passed.    \"I dinna ken,\" said the other Scot. \"An' I dinna care.\"    \"It's the Commander-in-Chief,\" I said. \"Sir John French.\"    \"Eh?\" said the younger man, of the 8th Gordons. He did not seem thrilled  by the knowledge I had given him, but turned his head and stared after  the figure on the white horse. Then he said: \"Well, he's made a mess o'  the battle. We could've held Hill 70 against all the di'els o' hell if  there had bin supports behind us.\"    \"Ay,\" said his comrade, \"an' there's few o' the laddies'll come back fra  Cite St.-Auguste.\"          IX      It was another commander-in-chief who received us some months after the  battle of Loos, in a chateau near Montreuil, to which G. H. Q. had then  removed. Our only knowledge of Sir Douglas Haig before that day was of  a hostile influence against us in the First Army, which he commanded. He  had drawn a line through his area beyond which we might not pass. He did  not desire our presence among his troops nor in his neighborhood. That  line had been broken by the protests of our commandant, and now as  Commander-in-Chief, Sir Douglas Haig had realized dimly that he might be  helped by our services.    It was in another French salon that we waited for the man who controlled  the British armies in the field--those armies which we now knew in some  intimacy, whom we had seen in the front-line trenches and rest-camps and  billets, hearing their point of view, knowing their suffering and their  patience, and their impatience--and their deadly hatred of G. H. Q.    He was very handsome as he sat behind a Louis XIV table, with General  Charteris--his Chief of Intelligence, who was our chief, too--behind him  at one side, for prompting and advice. He received us with fine courtesy  and said:    \"Pray be seated, gentlemen.\"    There had been many troubles over censorship, of which he knew but  vaguely through General Charteris, who looked upon us as his special  \"cross.\" We had fought hard for liberty in mentioning units, to give  the honor to the troops, and for other concessions which would free our  pens.    The Commander-in-Chief was sympathetic, but his sympathy was expressed  in words which revealed a complete misunderstanding of our purpose and  of our work, and was indeed no less than an insult, unconscious but very  hurtful.    \"I think I understand fairly well what you gentlemen want,\" he said.  \"You want to get hold of little stories of heroism, and so forth, and to  write them up in a bright way to make good reading for Mary Ann in the  kitchen, and the Man in the Street.\" The quiet passion with which those  words were resented by us, the quick repudiation of this slur upon our  purpose by a charming man perfectly ignorant at that time of the new  psychology of nations in a war which was no longer a professional  adventure, surprised him. We took occasion to point out to him that the  British Empire, which had sent its men into this war, yearned to know  what they were doing and how they were doing, and that their patience  and loyalty depended upon closer knowledge of what was happening than  was told them in the communiques issued by the Commander-in-Chief  himself. We urged him to let us mention more frequently the names of the  troops engaged--especially English troops--for the sake of the soldiers  themselves, who were discouraged by this lack of recognition, and for  the sake of the people behind them... It was to the pressure of the  war correspondents, very largely, that the troops owed the mention  and world-wide honor which came to them, more generously, in the later  phases of the war.    The Commander-in-Chief made a note of our grievances, turning now and  again to General Charteris, who was extremely nervous at our frankness  of speech, and telling him to relax the rules of censorship as far as  possible. That was done, and in later stages of the war I personally  had no great complaint against the censorship, and wrote all that was  possible to write of the actions day by day, though I had to leave out  something of the underlying horror of them all, in spite of my continual  emphasis, by temperament and by conviction, on the tragedy of all this  sacrifice of youth. The only alternative to what we wrote would have  been a passionate denunciation of all this ghastly slaughter and violent  attacks on British generalship. Even now I do not think that would have  been justified. As Bernard Shaw told me, \"while the war lasts one must  put one's own soul under censorship.\"    After many bloody battles had been fought we were received again by the  Commander-in-Chief, and this time his cordiality was not marred by any  slighting touch.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"you have played the game like men!\"    When victory came at last--at last!--after the years of slaughter, it  was the little band of war correspondents on the British front, our  foreign comrades included, whom the Field-Marshal addressed on his first  visit to the Rhine. We stood on the Hohenzollern Bridge in Cologne,  watched by groups of Germans peering through the escort of Lancers. It  was a dank and foul day, but to us beautiful, because this was the end  of the long journey--four-and--a-half years long, which had been filled  with slaughter all the way, so that we were tired of its backwash  of agony, which had overwhelmed our souls--mine, certainly. The  Commander-in-Chief read out a speech to us, thanking us for our  services, which, he said, had helped him to victory, because we had  heartened the troops and the people by our work. It was a recognition  by the leader of our armies that, as chroniclers of war, we had been a  spiritual force behind his arms. It was a reward for many mournful days,  for much agony of spirit, for hours of danger--some of us had walked  often in the ways of death--and for exhausting labors which we did  so that the world might know what British soldiers had been doing and  suffering.          X      I came to know General Headquarters more closely when it removed, for  fresher air, to Montreuil, a fine old walled town, once within sight of  the sea, which ebbed over the low-lying ground below its hill, but  now looking across a wide vista of richly cultivated fields where many  hamlets are scattered among clumps of trees. One came to G. H. Q. from  journeys over the wild desert of the battlefields, where men lived in  ditches and \"pill-boxes,\" muddy, miserable in all things but spirit, as  to a place where the pageantry of war still maintained its old and dead  tradition. It was like one of those pageants which used to be played in  England before the war--picturesque, romantic, utterly unreal. It was as  though men were playing at war here, while others sixty miles away were  fighting and dying, in mud and gas-waves and explosive barrages.    An \"open sesame,\" by means of a special pass, was needed to enter this  City of Beautiful Nonsense. Below the gateway, up the steep hillside,  sentries stood at a white post across the road, which lifted up on  pulleys when the pass had been examined by a military policeman in a  red cap. Then the sentries slapped their hands on their rifles to the  occupants of any motor-car, sure that more staff-officers were going  in to perform those duties which no private soldier could attempt to  understand, believing they belonged to such mysteries as those of God.  Through the narrow streets walked elderly generals, middle-aged colonels  and majors, youthful subalterns all wearing red hat-bands, red tabs,  and the blue-and-red armlet of G. H. Q., so that color went with them on  their way.    Often one saw the Commander-in-Chief starting for an afternoon ride,  a fine figure, nobly mounted, with two A. D. C.'s and an escort of  Lancers. A pretty sight, with fluttering pennons on all their lances,  and horses groomed to the last hair. It was prettier than the real thing  up in the salient or beyond the Somme, where dead bodies lay in upheaved  earth among ruins and slaughtered trees. War at Montreuil was quite a  pleasant occupation for elderly generals who liked their little stroll  after lunch, and for young Regular officers, released from the painful  necessity of dying for their country, who were glad to get a game of  tennis, down below the walls there, after strenuous office-work in which  they had written \"Passed to you\" on many \"minutes,\" or had drawn the  most comical caricatures of their immediate chief, and of his immediate  chief, on blotting-pads and writing-blocks.    It seemed, at a mere glance, that all these military inhabitants of G.  H. Q. were great and glorious soldiers. Some of the youngest of them had  a row of decorations from Montenegro, Serbia, Italy, Rumania, and other  states, as recognition of gallant service in translating German letters  (found in dugouts by the fighting-men), or arranging for visits  of political personages to the back areas of war, or initialing  requisitions for pink, blue, green, and yellow forms, which in due  course would find their way to battalion adjutants for immediate  filling-up in the middle of an action. The oldest of them, those  white-haired, bronze-faced, gray-eyed generals in the administrative  side of war, had started their third row of ribbons well before the end  of the Somme battles, and had flower-borders on their breasts by the  time the massacres had been accomplished in the fields of Flanders. I  know an officer who was awarded the D. S. O. because he had hindered the  work of war correspondents with the zeal of a hedge-sparrow in search of  worms, and another who was"]]]
