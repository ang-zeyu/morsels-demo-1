Here the fruit is grown for  its beauty only, and thus no gastronomic possibilities interfere with  the appreciation of color, and form, and situation! But again, to come  to the Arboretum some time during the reign of the lilacs is to  experience an even greater pleasure, perhaps, for here the old farm  garden \"laylock\" assumes a wonderful diversity of form and color, from  the palest wands of the Persian sorts to the deepest blue of some of the  French hybrids.    The pines themselves will well repay any investigation and appreciation.  Seven species are with us in the New England and Middle Atlantic States,  seven more are found South, while the great West, with its yet  magnificent forests, has twenty-five pines of distinct character. The  white pine is perhaps most familiar to us, because of its economic  importance, and it is as well the tallest and most notable of all those  we see in the East. From its first essay as a seedling, with its  original cluster of five delicate blue-green leaflets, to its lusty  youth, when it is spreading and broad, if given room to grow, it is a  fine object, and I have had some thrills of joy at finding this splendid  common thing planted in well-placed groups on the grounds of wealthy  men, instead of some Japanese upstart with a name a yard long and a  truly crooked Oriental disposition! In age the white pine dominates any  landscape, wearing even the scars of its long battle with the elements  with stately dignity. A noble pair of white pines on the shore of Lake  Champlain I remember especially--they were the monarchs of the lakeside  as they towered above all other trees. Ragged they were, their symmetry  gone long years ago through attacks of storms and through strife with  the neighboring trees that had succumbed while they only suffered and  stood firm. Yet they seemed all complete, of proved strength and staying  power, and their aspect was not of defiance or anger, but rather  indicative of beneficent strength, as if they said, \"Here we stand;  somewhat crippled, it is true, but yet pointing upright to the heavens,  yet vigorous, yet seed-bearing and cheerful!\"    Another group of these white pines that stood close to some only less  picturesque red pines on the shores of a pond deep in the Adirondacks  emphasized again for me one May day the majesty of this beneficent  friend of mankind; and yet another old pine monarch against the sunset  sky pointed the westward way from the picturesque Cornell campus, and  alas! also pointed the danger to even this one unreplaceable tree when  modern \"enterprise\" constructs a trolley line on a scenic route,  ruthlessly destroying the very features that make the route desirable,  rather than go to any mechanical trouble!    My readers will easily recall for themselves just the same sort of \"old  pine\" groups they have record of on memory's picture-gallery, and will,  I am sure, agree with me as to the informality, dignity and true beauty  of these survivors of the forest, all of which deserve to be  appreciatively cared for, against any encroachment of train, trolley or  lumberman.    I am ashamed to say I have not yet seen the blossoms of the white pine,  which the botanists tell us come in early spring, minute and light  brown, to be followed by the six-inch-long cones which mature the second  year. I promise my camera that another spring it shall be turned toward  these shy blossoms.    [Illustration: The long-leaved pines of the South]    [Illustration: The fountain-like effect of the young long-leaved pine]    Any one who has traveled south of Virginia, even by the Pullman way of  not seeing, cannot fail to have noted the lovely green leaf-fountains  springing up from the ground along the railroads. These are the young  trees of the long-leaved or Southern yellow pine. How beautiful they  are, these narrow leaves of vivid green, more than a foot long, drooping  gracefully from the center outward, with none of the stiffness of our  Northern species! In some places they seem to fairly bubble in green  from all the surface of the ground, so close are they. And the grand  long-leaved pine itself, maintained in lusty vigor above these  greeneries, is a tree of simple dignity, emphasized strongly when seen  at its best either in the uncut forest, or in a planted avenue. We of  the North are helping to ruin the next generation of Southern pines by  lavish use, for decorations, of the young trees of about two feet high,  crowded with the long drooping emerald needles. The little cut-off pine  lasts a week or two, in a parlor--it took four or five years to grow!    All pine-cones are interesting, and there is a great variation between  the different species. The scrub-pine one sees along the railroads  between New York and Philadelphia has rather stubby cones, while the  pitch-pine, beloved of the fireplace for its \"light-knots,\" has a  somewhat pear-shaped and gracefully disposed cone. A most peculiar cone  is that of a variety of the Norway pine, which, among other species  brought from Europe, is valued for ornament. The common jack-pine of the  Middle States hillsides wears symmetrical and handsome cones with  dignity. Cones are, of course, the fruits or seed-holders of the pine,  but the seeds themselves are found at the base of the scales, or parts  of the cones, attached in pairs. Each cone, like an apple, has in its  care a number of seeds, which it guards against various dangers until a  kindly soil encourages the rather slow germination characteristic of the  order.    The nurserymen have imported many pines from Europe, which give pleasing  variety to our ornamental plantings, and aid in enriching the winter  coloring. The Austrian pine and the Scotch pine are welcome additions to  our own pine family. In these days of economic chemistry and a  deficient rag supply, every reader of these words is probably in close  proximity to an important spruce product--paper. The manufacturers say,  with hand on heart, that they do not use _much_ wood pulp, but when one  has passed a great paper-mill flanked on all sides by piles of spruce  logs, with no bales of rags in sight anywhere, he is tempted to think  otherwise! Modern forestry is now planting trees on waste lands for the  pulp \"crop,\" and the common poplar is coming in to relieve the spruces.    Beautiful trees are these spruces and firs, either in the forest or when  brought by the planter to his home grounds. The leaves are much shorter  than those of most pines, and clothe the twigs closely. There is a vast  variety in color, too, from the wonderful whitish or \"glaucous\" blue of  the Colorado blue spruce, to the deep shining green of Nordmann's fir, a  splendid introduction from the Caucasus. Look at them, glistening in the  winter sun, or drooping with the clinging snow; walk in a spruce wood,  inhaling the bracing balsamic fragrance which seems so kindly to the  lungs; hark to the music of the wind in their tops, telling of health  and purity, of God's love and provision for man's mind and heart, and  you will begin to know the song of the firs. To really hear this grand  symphony, for such it then becomes, you must listen to the wind playing  on the tops of a great primeval coniferous forest, of scores and  hundreds of acres or miles in extent. And even then, many visits are  needed, for there are movements to this symphony--the allegro of the  gale, the scherzo of the easy morning breeze, the deep adagio of a  rain-storm, and the andante of warm days and summer breezes, when you  may repose prone upon a soft carpet of pine needles, every sense made  alert, yet soothed, by the master-theme you are hearing.    There is a little wood of thick young pines, interspersed with hard  maple and an occasional birch, close by the lake of the Eagles, where my  summers are made happy. The closeness of the pines has caused their  lower branches to die, as always in the deep forest, and the falling  needles, year by year, have deepened the soft brown carpet that covers  the forest floor. Some one, years ago, struck by the aisles that the  straight trunks mark out so clearly, called this the \"Cathedral Woods.\"  The name seems appropriate at all times, but especially when, on a warm  Sunday afternoon, I lie at ease on the aromatic carpet, hearing the soft  organ tones in the pine tops, and drinking in God's forest message.    [Illustration: An avenue of white pines]    I have visited these pine woods at midnight, when a full moon, making  brilliant the near-by lake, gave but a ghostly gloom in the deep, deep  silence of the Cathedral; but, more impressive, I have often trodden  through in a white fog, when the distance was misty and dim, and the  aisles seemed longer and higher, and to lead one further away from the  trifles of temper and trial. Indeed, I do not believe that any one who  has but once fully received from the deep forest that which it gives out  so freely and constantly can ever think of things trivial, or of minor  annoyances, while again within its soothing portals.    But of the trees of the forest of pine and spruce it must be noted that  sometimes the deepest, glossiest green of the leaves as presented to  the eye only hides the dainty, white-lined interior surface of those  same leaves. To the outside, a somber dignity, unassailable, untouched  by frost or sun, protective, defenseful, as nature often appears to the  careless observer; but inside is light, softly reflected, revealing  unsuspected delicacies of structure and finish.    To us who are not woodsmen or \"timber-cruisers\" the most familiar of all  the spruces is the introduced form from Norway. Its yellowish green  twigs are bright and cheerful, and in specimens that have reached the  fruiting age the crown of cones, high up in the tree, is an additional  charm, for these soft brown \"strobiles,\" as the botanist calls them, are  smooth and regular, and very different from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28767"],[0,"The Defenders (#6)"],[1,"y.\"    \"The conquest of space,\" breathed Colonel Borodoy.    \"The meaning of life,\" Moss added.    \"Eliminating hunger and poverty,\" said Taylor.    The leady opened the door of the ship. \"All that and more. How much  more? We cannot foresee it any more than the first men who formed a  tribe could foresee this day. But it will be unimaginably great.\"    The door closed and the ship took off toward their new home.                                                          --PHILIP K.
