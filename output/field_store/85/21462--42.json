And she did not dare  leave the active boy alone in the house. Little Matty could be caged in  her crib, and, even if she woke, she would at best only cry. But Tom was  irrepressible.    So they unbolted the lee-door, and worked out into the snow. Then poor  Laura, with the child, crept round into the storm. Heavens! how it  raged and howled! Where was her poor bridegroom now? She seized up Tom,  and turned her back to the wind, and worked along, go,--step sideway,  sideway, the only way she could by step,--did it ever seem so far  before? Tommy was crying. \"One minute more, dear boy. Tommy shall see  the other lantern. And Tommy shall carry mamma's great scissors up the  stairs. Don't cry, my darling, don't cry.\"    Here is the door;--just as she began to wonder if she were dreaming or  crazy. Not so badly drifted in as she feared. At least she is under  cover. \"Up-a-day, my darling, up-a-day. One, two, what a many steps for  Tommy! That's my brave boy.\" And they were on the lantern deck again,  fairly rocking in the gale,--and Laura was chopping away on her stiff  wicks, and pumping up her oil again, and filling the receivers, as if  she had ever done it till this Christmas before. And she kept saying  over to herself,--    \"Then those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.\"    \"And I will light them,\" said she aloud. \"That will save another walk at  sundown. And I know these carcels run at least five hours.\" So she  struck a match, and with some little difficulty coaxed the fibres to  take fire. The yellow light flared luridly on the white snow-flakes, and  yet it dazzled her and Tommy as it flashed on them from the reflectors.  \"Will anybody see it, mamma?\" said the child. \"Will papa see it?\" And  just then the witching devil who manages the fibres of memory, drew from  the little crypt in Laura's brain, where they had been stored unnoticed  years upon years, four lines of Leigh Hunt's, and the child saw that she  was Hero:--        \"Then at the flame a torch of fire she lit,      And, o'er her head anxiously holding it,      Ascended to the roof, and, leaning there,      Lifted its light into the darksome air.\"    If only the devil would have been satisfied with this. But of course she  could not remember that, without remembering Schiller:--        \"In the gale her torch is blasted,        Beacon of the hoped-for strand:      Horror broods above the waters,        Horror broods above the land.\"    And she said aloud to the boy, \"Our torch shall not go out, Tommy,--come  down, come down, darling, with mamma.\" But all through the day horrid  lines from the same poem came back to her. Why did she ever learn it!  Why, but because dear Tom gave her the book himself; and this was his  own version, as he sent it to her from the camp in the valley,--        \"Yes, 'tis he! although he perished,      Still his sacred troth he cherished.\"    \"Why did Tom write it for me?\"        \"And they trickle, lightly playing      O'er a corpse upon the sand.\"    \"What a fool I am! Come, Tommy. Come, Matty, my darling. Mamma will tell  you a story. Once there was a little boy, and he had two kittens. And he  named one Buff and one Muff\"-- But this could not last for ever. Sundown  came. And then Laura and Tommy climbed their own tower,--and she lighted  her own lantern, as she called it. Sickly and sad through the storm, she  could see the sister lantern burning bravely. And that was all she could  see in the sullen whiteness. \"Now, Tommy, my darling, we will come and  have some supper.\" \"And while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered  and slept.\" \"Yes, 'tis he; although he perished, still his sacred troth  he cherished.\" \"Come, Tommy,--come Tommy,--come, Tommy, let me tell you  a story.\"    But the children had their supper,--asking terrible questions about  papa,--questions which who should answer? But she could busy herself  about giving them their oatmeal, and treating them to ginger-snaps,  because it was Christmas Eve. Nay, she kept her courage, when Tommy  asked if Santa Claus would come in the boat with papa. She fairly  loitered over the undressing them. Little witches, how pretty they were  in their flannel nightgowns! And Tommy kissed her, and gave her--ah  me!--one more kiss for papa. And in two minutes they were asleep. It  would have been better if they could have kept awake one minute longer.  Now she was really alone. And very soon seven o'clock has come. She does  not dare leave the clock-work at the outer lantern a minute longer. Tom  and Mipples wind the works every four hours, and now they have run five.  One more look at her darlings. Shall she ever see them again in this  world? Now to the duty next her hand!    Yes, the wind is as fierce as ever! A point more to the north, Laura  notices. She has no child to carry now. She tumbles once in the drift.  But Laura has rolled in snow before. The pile at the door is three feet  thick. But she works down to the latch,--and even her poor numb hand  conquers it,--and it gives way. How nice and warm the tower is! and how  well the lights burn! Can they be of any use this night to anybody? O my  God, grant that they be of use to him!    She has wound them now. She has floundered into the snow again. Two or  three falls on her way home,--but no danger that she loses the line of  march. The light above her own house is before her. So she has only to  aim at that. Home again! And now to wait for five hours,--and then to  wind that light again--at midnight!    \"And at midnight there was a cry made\"--\"oh dear!--if he would come,--I  would not ask for any cry!\"--           *       *       *       *       *    And Laura got down her choice inlaid box, that Jem brought her from  sea,--and which held her treasures of treasures. And the dear girl did  the best thing she could have done. She took these treasures out.--You  know what they were, do not you? They were every letter Tom Cutts ever  wrote her--from the first boy note in print,--\"Laura,--these hedgehog  quills are for you. I killed him. TOM.\" And Laura opened them all,--and  read them one by one, each twice,--and put them back, in their order,  without folding, into the box. At ten she stopped,--and worked her way  upstairs into her own lantern,--and wound its works again. She tried to  persuade herself that there was less wind,--did persuade herself so. But  the snow was as steady as ever. Down the tower-stairs again,--and then a  few blessed minutes brooding over Matty's crib, and dear little Tom who  has kicked himself right athwart her own bed where she had laid him.  Darlings! they are so lovely, their father must come home to see them!  Back then to her kitchen fire. There are more of dear Tom's letters yet.  How manly they are,--and how womanly. She will read them all!--will she  ever dare to read them all again?    Yes,--she reads them all,--each one twice over,--and his soldier  diary,--which John Wildair saved and sent home, and, as she lays it  down, the clock strikes twelve. Christmas day is born!--    \"And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh.\"  Laura fairly repeated this aloud. She knew that the other carcel must be  wound again. She dressed herself for the fight thoroughly. She ran in  and trusted herself to kiss the children. She opened the lee-door  again, and crept round again into the storm,--familiar now with such  adventure. Did the surf beat as fiercely on the rocks? Surely not. But  then the tide is now so low! So she came to her other tower, crept up  and wound her clock-work up again, wiped off, or tried to wipe off, what  she thought was mist gathering on the glasses, groped down the stairway,  and looked up on the steady light above her own home. And the Christmas  text came back to her. \"The star went before them, and stood above the  place where the young child was.\"    \"A light to lighten the Gentiles,--and the glory of my people Israel!\"    \"By the way of the sea,\"--and this Laura almost shouted aloud,--\"Galilee  of the Gentiles, the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and  to them who sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.\"  \"Grant it, merciful Father,--grant it for these poor children!\" And she  almost ran through the heavy drifts, till she found the shelter again of  her friendly tower. Her darlings had not turned in their bed, since she  left them there.    And after this Laura was at rest. She took down her Bible, and read the  Christmas chapters. It was as if she had never known before what  darkness was,--or what the Light was, when it came. She took her Hymn  Book and read all the Christmas Hymns. She took her Keble,--and read  every poem for Advent and the hymn for Christmas morning. She knew this  by heart long ago. Then she took Bishop Ken's \"Christian Year,\"--which  Tom had given for her last birthday present,--and set herself bravely to  committing his \"Christmas Day\" to memory:--          \"Celestial harps, prepare        To sound your loftiest air;      You choral angels at the throne,      Your customary hymns postpone;\"    and thus, dear girl, she kept herself from thinking even of the wretched  Hero and Leander lines, till her clock struck three. Upstairs then to  her own tower, and to look out upon the night. The sister flame was  steady. The wind was all hushed. But the snow was as steady, right and  left, behind and before. Down again, one more look at the darlings, and  then, as she walked up and down her little kitchen, she repeated the  verses she had learned, and then sat down to--        \"You with your heavenly ray      Gild the expanse this day;        \"You with your heavenly ray      Gild--the expanse--this day;        \"You--with--your--heavenly--ray\"--    Dear Laura, bless God, she is asleep. \"He giveth his beloved sleep.\"           *       *      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32472"],[0,"Food in War Time (#6)"],[1,"g)                     41.3        32.0      Eggs                                   44.7        45.0 (1 dozen)      Beefsteak (round)                      50.4        34.0      TABLE 7--_Cost of Fruit._      Fresh (in season):        Bananas                              23.0         6        Apples                               23.7         5        Oranges                              65.0        10      Dried:        Prunes                                8.4        10        Apples                               11.1        15        Peaches                              12.5        15        Apricots                             15.5        20      TABLE 8--_Cost of Syrup._      Cane sugar                              4.5         8      Karo corn syrup                         5.7         8    A British scientific commission has reported to Parliament that if the  workman be undernourished he may, by grit and pluck, continue his labor  for a certain time, but in the end his work is sure to fail. It makes no  difference what the nutritive condition of the person is, if a certain  job involving muscular effort is to be done it always requires a  definite amount of extra food-fuel to do it. Rubner, the greatest German  authority on nutrition, excited grossly inappropriate hilarity in the  comic press of his country by showing that a poor woman who waited  several hours in line in order to receive the dole of fat allowed her by  the government actually consumed more of her own body fat in the effort  of standing during those hours than she obtained in the fat given her  when her turn to receive it came at last.    A method by which food-fuel can readily be saved with benefit to the  nation and to the individual is for the overfat to reduce their weight.  This has been done with drastic severity in Germany. I have heard from  unquestioned sources how a man who had weighed 240 pounds lost 90 pounds  since the war began; how a corpulent professor at Breslau lost greatly  in weight, but during the second summer of the war regained his former  corpulence during a sojourn in the Bavarian Tyrol, a joy not now  tolerated; and how an American woman lost 40 pounds in weight last  winter in Dresden. There is every reason why a man who is overweight at  the age of fifty should reduce his weight until he reaches the weight he  was when he was thirty-five. According to Dr. Fisk he is a better  insurance risk if after thirty-five he is under the weight which is the  average for those of his years. Reduction in weight reduces the basal  requirement for food, and reduces the amount of fuel needed for moving  the body in walking. The most extreme illustration of the effect of  emaciation upon the food requirement is afforded by a woman who after  losing nearly half of her body weight was found to need only 40 per  cent. of the food-fuel formerly required. This represented a state not  far from the border line of death from starvation, but it indicates how  a community may long support itself on restricted rations. It must be  strictly borne in mind, however, that if any external muscular work is  to be accomplished it can only be effected at the expense of a given  added quantity of food-fuel, whether the person be fat or thin.    It is not at all difficult to reduce the body weight. Suppose a  clergyman or a physician requires 2500 calories daily in the  accomplishment of his work and takes 2580 calories per day instead. The  additional 80 calories is the equivalent of a butter ball weighing a  third of an ounce, or an ounce of bread or half a glass of milk. It  would seem to be the height of absurdity to object to such a trifle. But  if this excess in food intake be continued for a year, the person will  gain nine pounds and at the end of ten years ninety pounds. Such a  person would find that he required a constantly increasing amount of  food in order to transport his constantly increasing weight. In  instances of this sort a motto may be applied which I heard the last  time I was in Washington: \"Do not stuff your husband, husband your  stuff.\"    Now it is evident that, if instead of taking more than the required  amount of food a little less be taken than is needed, the balance of  food-fuel must be obtained from the reserves of the body's own supply of  fat. By cutting down the quantity of fat taken, or by eliminating a  glass of beer or a drink of whiskey, and not compensating for the loss  of these by adding other food stuffs, the weight may be gradually  reduced. The amusing little book entitled \"Eat and Grow Thin\" recommends  a high protein and almost carbohydrate-free diet for the accomplishment  of this purpose, but its advice has made so many of my friends so  utterly miserable that I am sure in the end it will counteract its own  message.    The work of the world is accomplished in largest part by the oxidation  of carbohydrates, that is to say, of sugars and starches. Bread, corn,  rice, macaroni, cane-sugar, these are _par excellence_ the food-fuels of  the human machine. In the dinner-pail of the laborer they testify as to  the source of his power. They are convertible into glucose in the body,  which glucose gives power to the human machine. They may be used for the  production of work without of themselves increasing the heat production  of the worker, as happens after meat ingestion. (See p. 18.) Fat also  may be used as a source of energy, but unless carbohydrate is present a  person can not work up to his fullest capacity.    Cane-sugar is a valuable condiment, and when taken in small quantities  every half hour, may delay the onset of fatigue. It is more largely used  in the United States than in other countries in the world. As a  substitute, glucose may be used. This is found in grapes and in raisins  and it is also produced in large quantities by the hydrolysis of starch  and sold under the commercial name of corn syrup or Karo. This substance  is entirely wholesome and may be freely employed in the place of sugar,  which is scarce.    As to the use of alcoholic beverages, the question resolves itself into  several factors. Alcohol gives a sham sensation of added force and in  reality decreases the ability to do work. Alcohol is the greatest cause  of misery in the world, and as Cushny has put it, if alcohol had been a  new synthetic drug introduced from Germany, its importation would long  since have been forbidden. On the other hand, good beer makes poor food  taste well. It also frequently leads to overeating. The cure for bad  food is to have our daughters taught how to cook a decent meal. After  that we can talk about prohibition.    In some parts of the world whole nations are starving to death. In most  countries of the world people are short of food. In America we have more  food than in any other land, and we must, therefore, be careful in our  abundance, saving it to the utmost, while, at the same time, conserving  the safety of our own people.          III    RULES OF SAVING AND SAFETY      1. Let no family (of five persons) buy meat until it has bought three  quarts of milk, the cheapest protein food. Farmers should be urged to  meet this demand.    2. Save the cream and butter and eat oleomargarine and vegetable oils.  Olive oil or cottonseed oil, taken with cabbage, lettuce, or beet-tops,  is excellent food, in many ways imitating milk.    3. Eat meat sparingly, rich and poor, laborer and indolent alike. Meat  does not increase the muscular power. When a person is exposed to great  cold, meat may be recommended, for it warms the body more than any other  food. In hot weather, for the same reason, it causes increased sweating  and discomfort. In general, twice as much meat is used as is now right,  for to produce meat requires much fodder which might better be used for  milk production.    4. Eat corn bread. It saved our New England ancestors from starvation.  If we eat it we can send wheat to France. Eat oatmeal.    5. Drink no alcohol. In many families 10 per cent. of the income is  spent for drink, or a sum which, if spent for real food, would greatly  improve the welfare of the family.    6. Eat corn syrup on cereals. It will save the sugar. Eat raisins in  rice pudding, for raisins contain sugar.    7. Eat fresh fish.    8. Eat fruit and vegetables.    Since the total energy for the maintenance of our bodies can be measured  in calories, and since this energy serves for the maintenance of the  nations of the world, is it not surprising how little even educated  people know about the subject?
