An instance  which leads still more unequivocally to the same conclusion is given by  Humboldt. He states that an acre of land, planted with bananas, yields  annually about 152,000 pounds weight of fruit, containing about 32,000  pounds, or almost exactly 14 tons of carbon; and as this production goes  on during a period of twenty years, there must be withdrawn in that time  no less than 280 tons of carbon. But the soil on an acre of land weighs,  in round numbers, 1000 tons, and supposing it to contain 4 per cent of  humus, the total weight of carbon in it would amount to little more than  20 tons.    It is obvious from these and many other analogous facts that humus  cannot be the only or even a considerable source of the carbon of  plants, although it is still contended by some chemists that it may be  absorbed to a small extent. But even this is at variance with many  well-known facts. For if humus were absorbed, it might be expected that  vegetation would be most luxuriant on soils containing abundance of that  substance, especially if it existed in a soluble and readily absorbable  form; but so far from this being the case, nothing is more certain than  that peat, in which these conditions are fulfilled, is positively  injurious to most plants. On the other hand, our daily experience  affords innumerable examples of plants growing luxuriantly in soils and  places where no humus exists. The sands of the sea-shore, and the most  barren rocks, have their vegetation, and the red-hot ashes which are  thrown out by active volcanoes are no sooner cool than a crop of plants  springs up on them.    The conclusions to be drawn from these considerations have been further  confirmed by the direct experiments of different observers. Boussingault  sowed peas, weighing 15.60 grains, in a soil composed of a mixture of  sand and clay, which had been heated red-hot, and consequently contained  no humus, and after 99 days' growth, during which they had been watered  with distilled water, he found the crop to weigh 68.72 grains, so that  there had been a fourfold increase. Similar experiments have been made  by Prince Salm Horstmar, on oats and rape sown in a soil deprived of  organic matter by ignition, in which they grew readily, and arrived at  complete maturity. One oat straw attained a height of three feet, and  bore 78 grains; another bore 47; and a third 28--in all 153. These when  dried at 212 deg. weighed 46.302 grains, and the straw 45.6 grains. The most  satisfactory experiments, however, are those of Weigman and Polstorf,  these observers having found that it was possible to obtain a  two-hundred-fold produce of barley in an entirely artificial soil,  provided care was taken to give it the _physical_ characters of a  fertile soil. They prepared a mixture of six parts of sand, two of  chalk, one of white bole, and one of wood charcoal; to which was added a  small quantity of felspar, previously fused with marble and some soluble  salts, so as to imitate as closely as possible the inorganic parts of a  soil, and in it they planted twelve barley pickles. The plants grew  luxuriantly, reaching a height of three feet, and each bearing nine  ears, containing 22 pickles. The grain of the twelve plants weighed 2040  grains.    These experiments show that plants can grow and produce seed when the  most scrupulous care is taken to deprive them of every trace of humus.  But Saussure has gone further, and shown that even when present, humus  is not absorbed. He allowed plants of the common bean and the Polygonum  Persicaria to grow in solutions of humate of potash, and found a very  trifling diminution in the quantity of humic acid present; but the value  of his experiments is invalidated by his having omitted to ascertain  whether the diminution of humic acid which he observed was really due  to absorption by the plant. This omission has been supplied by Weigman  and Polstorf. They grew plants of mint (Mentha undulata) and of  Polygonum Persicaria in solutions of humate of potash, and placed beside  the glass containing the plant, another perfectly similar, and  containing only the solution of humate of potash. The solution, which  contained in every 100 grains, 0.148 grains of solid matter, consisting  of humate of potash, etc. was found to become gradually paler, and at  the end of a month, during which time the plants had increased by 6-1/2  inches, the quantity of solid matter in 100 grains had diminished to  0.132. But the solution contained in the other glass, and in which no  plant had grown, had diminished to 0.136, so that the absorption could  not have amounted to more than 0.004 grains for every 100 grains of  solution employed. This quantity is so small as to be within the limits  of error of experiment, and we are consequently entitled to draw the  conclusion that humus, even under the most favourable circumstances, is  not absorbed by plants.    But though not directly capable of affording nutriment to plants, it  must not, on that account, be supposed that humus is altogether devoid  of importance, for it is constantly undergoing decomposition in the  soil, and thus becomes a source of carbonic acid which can be absorbed,  and, as we shall afterwards more particularly see, it exercises very  important functions in bringing the other constituents of the soil into  readily available forms of combination.    It has been already observed that carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and  oxygen, cannot be absorbed by plants when uncombined, but only in the  forms of water, carbonic acid, ammonia, and nitric acid. It is scarcely  necessary to detail the grounds on which this conclusion has been  arrived at in regard to carbon and hydrogen, for practically it is of  little importance whether they can be absorbed or not, as the former is  rarely, the latter never, found uncombined in nature. Neither can there  be any doubt that water and carbonic acid are the only substances from  which these elements can be obtained. Every-day experience convinces us  that water is essential to vegetation; and Saussure, and other  observers, have shown that plants will not grow if they are deprived of  carbonic acid, and that they actually absorb that substance abundantly  from the atmosphere. The evidence for the non-absorption of oxygen lies  chiefly in the fact that plants obtain, in the form of water and  carbonic acid, a larger quantity of that element than they require, and  in place of absorbing, are constantly exhaling it. The form in which  nitrogen may be absorbed has given rise to much difference of opinion.  In the year 1779, Priestley commenced the examination of this subject,  and drew from his experiments the conclusion, that plants absorb the  nitrogen of the air. Saussure shortly afterwards examined the same  subject, and having found, that when grown in a confined space of air,  and watered with pure water, the nitrogen of the plants underwent no  increase, he inferred that they derived their entire supplies of that  element from ammonia, or the soluble nitrogenous constituents of the  soil or manure. Boussingault has since re-examined this question, and by  a most elaborate series of experiments, in which the utmost care was  taken to avoid every source of fallacy, he was led to the conclusion,  that when haricots, oats, lupins, and cresses were grown in calcined  pumice-stone, mixed with the ash of plants, and supplied with air  deprived of ammonia and nitric acid, their nitrogen underwent no  increase. It has been objected to these experiments, that the plants  being confined in a limited bulk of air, were placed in an unnatural  condition, and Ville has recently repeated them with a current of air  passing through the apparatus, and found a slight increase in the  nitrogen, due, as he thinks, to direct absorption. It is much more  probable, however, that it depends on small quantities of ammonia or  nitric acid which had not been completely removed from the air by the  means employed for that purpose, for nothing is more difficult than the  complete abstraction of these substances, and as the gain of nitrogen  was only 0.8 grains, while 60,000 gallons of air, and 13 of water, were  employed in the experiment, which lasted for a considerable time, it is  reasonable to suppose that a sufficient quantity may have remained to  produce this trifling increase.    While these experiments show that plants maintain only a languid  existence when grown in air deprived of ammonia and nitric acid, and  hence, that the direct absorption of nitrogen, if it occur at all, must  do so to a very small extent, the addition of a very minute quantity of  the former substance immediately produces an active vegetation and rapid  increase in size of the plants. Among the most striking proofs of this  are the experiments of Wolff, made by growing barley and vetches in a  soil calcined so as to destroy organic matters, and then mixed with  small quantities of different compounds of ammonia. He found that when  the produce from the calcined soil was represented by 100, that from the  different ammoniacal salts was--                            Barley.     Vetches.    Muriate of Ammonia       257.2      176.4  Carbonate of Ammonia     123.6      173.8  Sulphate of Ammonia      203.6      125.2    These experiments not only prove that ammonia can be absorbed, but they  also indirectly confirm the statement already made, that humus is not  necessary; for in some instances the produce was higher than that  obtained from the uncalcined soil with the same manures, although it  contained four per cent of humus.    On such experiments Liebig rests his opinion that ammonia is the  exclusive source of the nitrogen of plants, and although he has recently  admitted that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#6)"],[1,"conditions of their own industry  and of their own daily lives more endurable. How far there was need of  such an interference may be judged by any fair-minded man who reads the  list of their complaints. A superficial view may recognise the Boers as  the champions of liberty, but a deeper insight must see that they (as  represented by their elected rulers) have in truth stood for all that  history has shown to be odious in the form of exclusiveness and  oppression. Their conception of liberty has been a narrow and selfish  one, and they have consistently inflicted upon others far heavier wrongs  than those against which they had themselves rebelled.    As the mines increased in importance and the miners in numbers, it was  found that these political disabilities affected some of that  cosmopolitan crowd far more than others, in proportion to the amount of  freedom to which their home institutions had made them accustomed. The  Continental Uitlanders were more patient of that which was unendurable  to the American and the Briton. The Americans, however, were in so great  a minority that it was upon the British that the brunt of the struggle  for freedom fell. Apart from the fact that the British were more  numerous than all the other Uitlanders combined, there were special  reasons why they should feel their humiliating position more than the  members of any other race. In the first place, many of the British were  British South Africans, who knew that in the neighbouring countries  which gave them birth the most liberal possible institutions had been  given to the kinsmen of these very Boers who were refusing them the  management of their own drains and water-supply. And again, every Briton  knew that Great Britain claimed to be the paramount Power in South  Africa, and so he felt as if his own land, to which he might have looked  for protection, was conniving at and acquiescing in his ill-treatment.  As citizens of the paramount Power, it was peculiarly galling that they  should be held in political subjection. The British, therefore, were the  most persistent and energetic of the agitators.    But it is a poor cause which cannot bear to fairly state and honestly  consider the case of its opponents. The Boers had made, as has been  briefly shown, great efforts to establish a country of their own. They  had travelled far, worked hard, and fought bravely. After all their  efforts they were fated to see an influx of strangers into their  country, some of them men of questionable character, who threatened to  outnumber the original inhabitants. If the franchise were granted to  these, there could be no doubt that, though at first the Boers might  control a majority of the votes, it was only a question of time before  the new-comers would dominate the Raad and elect their own President,  who might adopt a policy abhorrent to the original owners of the land.  Were the Boers to lose by the ballot-box the victory which they had won  by their rifles? Was it fair to expect it? These new-comers came for  gold. They got their gold. Their companies paid a hundred per cent. Was  not that enough to satisfy them? If they did not like the country, why  did they not leave it? No one compelled them to stay there. But if they  stayed, let them be thankful that they were tolerated at all, and not  presume to interfere with the laws of those by whose courtesy they were  allowed to enter the country.    That is a fair statement of the Boer position, and at first sight an  impartial man might say that there was a good deal to say for it; but a  closer examination would show that, though it might be tenable in  theory, it is unjust and impossible in practice.    In the present crowded state of the world a policy of Thibet may be  carried out in some obscure corner, but it cannot be done in a great  tract of country which lies right across the main line of industrial  progress. The position is too absolutely artificial. A handful of people  by the right of conquest take possession of an enormous country over  which they are dotted at such intervals that it is their boast that one  farmhouse cannot see the smoke of another, and yet, though their numbers  are so disproportionate to the area which they cover, they refuse to  admit any other people upon equal terms, but claim to be a privileged  class who shall dominate the new-comers completely. They are outnumbered  in their own land by immigrants who are far more highly educated and  progressive, and yet they hold them down in a way which exists nowhere  else upon earth. What is their right? The right of conquest. Then the  same right may be justly invoked to reverse so intolerable a situation.  This they would themselves acknowledge. 'Come on and fight! Come on!'  cried a member of the Volksraad when the franchise petition of the  Uitlanders was presented. 'Protest! Protest! What is the good of  protesting?' said Kruger to Mr. W. Y. Campbell; 'you have not got the  guns, I have.' There was always the final court of appeal. Judge Creusot  and Judge Mauser were always behind the President.    Again, the argument of the Boers would be more valid had they received  no benefit from these immigrants. If they had ignored them they might  fairly have stated that they did not desire their presence. But even  while they protested they grew rich at the Uitlanders' expense. They  could not have it both ways. It would be consistent to discourage him  and not profit by him, or to make him comfortable and build the State  upon his money; but to ill-treat him and at the same time grow strong by  his taxation must surely be an injustice.    And again, the whole argument is based upon the narrow racial  supposition that every naturalised citizen not of Boer extraction must  necessarily be unpatriotic. This is not borne out by the examples of  history. The new-comer soon becomes as proud of his country and as  jealous of her liberty as the old. Had President Kruger given the  franchise generously to the Uitlander, his pyramid would have been firm  upon its base and not balanced upon its apex. It is true that the  corrupt oligarchy would have vanished, and the spirit of a broader, more  tolerant freedom influenced the counsels of the State. But the republic  would have become stronger and more permanent with a population who, if  they differed in details, were united in essentials. Whether such a  solution would have been to the advantage of British interests in South  Africa is quite another question. In more ways than one President Kruger  has been a good friend to the Empire.    At the time of the Convention of Pretoria (1881) the rights of  burghership might be obtained by one year's residence. In 1882 it was  raised to five years, the reasonable limit which obtains both in Great  Britain and in the United States. Had it remained so, it is safe to say  that there would never have been either an Uitlander question or a war.  Grievances would have been righted from the inside without external  interference.    In 1890 the inrush of outsiders alarmed the Boers, and the franchise was  raised so as to be only attainable by those who had lived fourteen years  in the country. The Uitlanders, who were increasing rapidly in numbers  and were suffering from the formidable list of grievances already  enumerated, perceived that their wrongs were so numerous that it was  hopeless to have them set right seriatim, and that only by obtaining the  leverage of the franchise could they hope to move the heavy burden which  weighed them down. In 1893 a petition of 13,000 Uitlanders, couched in  most respectful terms, was submitted to the Raad, but met with  contemptuous neglect. Undeterred, however, by this failure, the National  Reform Union, an association which was not one of capitalists, came back  to the attack in 1894. They drew up a petition which was signed by  35,000 adult male Uitlanders, as great a number probably as the total  Boer male population of the country. A small liberal body in the Raad  supported this memorial and endeavoured in vain to obtain some justice  for the new-comers. Mr. Jeppe was the mouthpiece of this select band.  'They own half the soil, they pay at least three-quarters of the taxes,'  said he. 'They are men who in capital, energy, and education are at  least our equals. What will become of us or our children on that day  when we may find ourselves in a minority of one in twenty without a  single friend among the other nineteen, among those who will then tell  us that they wished to be brothers, but that we by our own act have made  them strangers to the republic?' Such reasonable and liberal sentiments  were combated by members who asserted that the signatures could not  belong to law-abiding citizens, since they were actually agitating  against the law of the franchise, and others whose intolerance was  expressed by the defiance of the member already quoted, who challenged  the Uitlanders to come out and fight. The champions of exclusiveness and  racial hatred won the day. The memorial was rejected by sixteen votes to  eight, and the franchise law was, on the initiative of the President,  actually made more stringent than ever, being framed in such a way that  during the fourteen years of probation the applicant should give up his  previous nationality, so that for that period he would belong to no  country at all. No hopes were held out that any possible attitude upon  the part of the Uitlanders would soften the determination of the  President and his burghers. One who remonstrated was led outside the  State buildings by the President, who pointed up at the national flag.  'You see that flag?' said he. 'If I grant the franchise, I may as well  pull it down.' His animosity against the immigrants was bitter.  'Burghers, friends, thieves, murderers, new-comers, and others,' is the  conciliatory opening of one of his public addresses. Though Johannesburg  is only thirty-two miles "]]]
