You forget, surely  that my father was a----\"    \"Oh, bother your father,\" ungallantly retorted Mr. Wren. \"I'm tired and  sick of that subject. If you don't like the looks of that house up there  say so, and I'll take you to see several others.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Mrs. Wren, who all the time had thought the tea-pot  just the cutest little apartment in the world, \"I'll fly up there and  examine it. Maybe it will do.\"    \"It's just lovely,\" she announced, flying back to the tree, and for a  minute or two they chattered and sang, and fluttered about in such a  joyful manner that some of their bird neighbors flew over, curious to  hear and see.    \"Still,\" remarked Mrs. Jenny the next day, when fetching material for  the nest, \"I had hoped, my dear, that you would have followed my  father's example in selecting a house for your family.\"    \"Still harping on 'my father,'\" groaned Mr. Wren, dropping on the porch  the straws he had fetched in his bill. \"Well,\" cheerfully, \"how did he  do, my dear?\"    \"As a bird of courage would, Mr. Wren. He never looked for a _vacant_  house, not he! From place to place, from tree to tree he flew, and when  he espied a nest which pleased him, off he chased the other bird and  took possession. Bluebird or Martin, it was all the same to him. Ah,  indeed, my father was a great warrior.\"    \"Hm, yes!\" said Mr. Wren, who didn't like to be thought less brave than  another. \"That accounted for his one eye and lame leg, I presume.\"    \"The scars of battle are not to be laughed at, Mr. Wren,\" loftily said  Mrs. Jenny, \"Papa's one eye and crooked leg were objects of great pride  to his family.\"    \"The old scoundrel,\" muttered Mr. Wren, who looked upon his  father-in-law as no better than a robber, but to keep peace in the  family he said no more, and with a gush of song flew off to gather some  particularly nice sticks for the nest.    For some days Mr. and Mrs. Wren were too busy to pay much attention to  their neighbors. Mr. Wren, unlike some birds he knew, did not do all the  singing while his mate did the work, but fetched and carried with the  utmost diligence, indeed brought more sticks, Mrs. Wren told her  friends, than she had any use for.    \"Such a litter, ma'am,\" said Bridget the next morning to the mistress of  the house, \"as I do be afther sweepin' up from the porch ivery day. A  pair of birds, I do be thinkin', are after building a nest in that owld  tin pot on the wall. It's this day I'm goin' to tear it down, so I am.  Birds are nuisances anyway, and it's not Bridget O'Flaherty that's goin'  to be clanin' afther them, at all, at all.\"    \"Oh don't!\" chorused the children, \"we want to see with our own eyes how  the birds go to housekeeping in the Spring. It's ever so much better than  just reading about it. Tell Bridget, mamma,\" they pleaded, \"to leave the  pot alone.\"    Mamma, who found bird-life a delightful study, was only too willing to  give the desired command, and thus it chanced that Mr. and Mrs. Wren  grew quite accustomed to many pair of eyes watching them at their work  of building a nest, every day.    \"Do you know,\" said Mrs. Wren, placing a particularly fine feather in  the nest one day, \"that I have a notion to name our birdlings, when they  come out of their shell, after our landlady's family? I think it is not  more than fair, since we have got a cute apartment and no rent to pay.\"    \"A capital idea!\" chirped Mr. Wren, \"her children have such pretty  names, too.\"    \"And pretty manners,\" returned Mrs. Wren, who, being of such genteel  birth, was quick to recognize it in others. \"Let me see, there's just  six. Pierre, Emmett, Walter, Henry, Bobby, and that darling little  fair-haired girl, Dorothy. I had my head tucked under my wing the other  evening, but all the same I heard her speaking a piece that she said she  had learned at school that day.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Wren, tilting his tail over his back and singing loudly,  \"I think we are very fortunate to have such a family for our neighbors.  You can pick up so many things their mamma says to the children, and  teach our birdies the same lessons, you know.\"    \"Of course,\" said Mrs. Wren, standing on the edge of the pot and eyeing  her work with great satisfaction, \"I had thought of that before. I  already have some of her sayings in my mind. But come, we musn't be  standing here chattering all day. The nest must be ready to-morrow for  the first egg.\"    \"Hm! You don't say?\" replied Mr. Wren, beginning to count his toes,  \"why, bless me, to-morrow is the twelfth day. Well, well, how time flies  when one is busy and happy,\" and off they both flew, singing as they  went for very joy.    [TO BE CONTINUED.]          SUMMARY.

The Food which supplies Respiration.    This, in the herbivorous animals, after they are deprived of the milk,  which furnishes it in abundance, is the starch, gum, sugar, vegetable  fats, and oils that exist in the vegetables, grain, and roots which they  consume; and in certain cases where there is a deficiency of other  food, it is sparingly furnished in woody and cellular fibre. All these  substances constitute the principal part of dry vegetable food, and are  made up of three elements, _which in starch, gum, cane-sugar, and  cellular fibre, exist in precisely the same proportions_, viz: 44 per  cent. of carbon, 6.2 of hydrogen, and 40.8 of oxygen.    Grape sugar, woody fibre, and vegetable and animal fats and oils are  made up of the same elements, but in different proportions, the last  containing much more carbon and hydrogen than those above specified. In  the fattening animals, it is supposed the vegetable fats and oils are  immediately transferred to the fat cells, undergoing only such slight  modification as perfectly adapts them to the animal economy, while  respiration is supplied by the other enumerated vegetable matters. If  these last are taken into the stomach beyond the necessary demand for  its object, they too are converted by the animal functions into fat, and  are stored up in the system for future use. But if the supply of the  latter is insufficient for respiration, it first appropriates the  vegetable fat contained in the food; if this is deficient, it draws on  the accumulated stores of animal fat already secreted in the system, and  when these too are exhausted, it seizes upon what is contained in the  tissues and muscle. When the animal commences drawing upon its own  resources for the support of its vital functions, deterioration begins;  and if long continued, great emaciation succeeds, which is soon followed  by starvation and death.    The carnivorous animals are furnished with their respiratory excretions,  from the animal fat and fibre which exist in their food, and which the  herbivorae had previously abstracted from the vegetable creation.      Circumstances which augment Respiration.    These are, exercise, cold, and an abundant supply of food. Exercise,  besides exhausting the materials of fat, produces a waste of fibre and  tissue, the muscular and nitrogenized parts of the animal system; and it  is obvious from the foregoing principles, that cold requires a  corresponding demand for carbon and hydrogen to keep up the vital  warmth. The consumption of food to the fullest extent required for  invigorating the frame, creates a desire for activity, and it insensibly  induces full respiration. The well-fed, active man, unconsciously draws  a full, strong breath; while the abstemious and the feeble, unwittingly  use it daintily, as if it were a choice commodity not to be lavishly  expended. If the first be observed when sleep has effectually arrested  volition, the expanded chest will be seen, heaving with the long-drawn,  sonorous breath; while that of the latter will exhibit the gentle repose  of the infant on its mother's breast.    The difference between the food of the inhabitants of the polar and  equatorial regions, is strikingly illustrative of the demands both for  breathing and perspiration. The latter are almost destitute of clothing,  and subsist on their light, juicy, tropical fruits, which contain  scarcely 12 per cent. of carbon, yet furnish all the elements for  abundant perspiration; while the former are imbedded in furs, and devour  gallons of train oil or its equivalent of fat, which contains nearly 80  per cent. of carbon, that is burnt up in respiration to maintain a  necessary warmth.    The bear retires to his den in the beginning of winter, loaded with fat,  which he has accumulated from the rich, oily mast abounding in the woods  in autumn. There he lies for months, snugly coiled and perfectly  dormant; the thickness of his shaggy coat, his dry bed of leaves, and  well-protected den, effectually guarding him from cold, which in  addition to his want of exercise, draw slightly upon respiration to keep  up the vital heat. When the stores of carbon and hydrogen contained in  the fat are expended, his hunger and cold compel him to leave his  winter-quarters, again to wander in pursuit of food.    Many of the swallow tribes, in like manner, hybernate in large hollow  trees, and for months eke out a torpid, scarcely perceptible existence,  independent of food. Activity and full respiration, on the return of  spring, demand a support, which is furnished in the myriads of flies  they daily consume. The toad and frog have repeatedly been found in a  torpid state, imbedded in limestones, sandstones, and the breccias,  where they were probably imprisoned for thousands of years without a  morsel of food; yet when exposed to the warmth of the vital air and the  stimulus of its oxygen, they have manifested all the activity of their  species. This they are enabled to sustain only by an enormous  consumption of insects.    Dr. Playfair states, that in an experiment made by Lord Ducie, 100 sheep  were placed in a shed, and ate 20 pounds of Swedes turnips each per day;  another 100 were placed in the open air, and ate 25 pounds per day; yet  the former, which had one-fifth less food, weighed, after a few weeks,  three pounds more per head than the latter. He then fed five sheep in  the open air, between the 21st November and 1st December. They consumed  90 pounds of food per day, the temperature being at 44 deg., and at the end  of this time, they weighed two pounds less than when first exposed. Five  sheep were then placed under a shed, and allowed to run about in a  temperature of 49 deg.. At first they consumed 82 pounds per day; then 70  pounds, and at the end of the time they had gained 23 pounds. Again,  five sheep were placed under a shed as before, and not allowed to take  any exercise. They ate at first, 64 pounds of food per day, then 58  pounds, and increased in weight 30 pounds. Lastly, five sheep were kept  quiet and covered, and in the dark. They ate 35 pounds per day, and  increased eight pounds.    Mr. Childers states, that 80 Leicester sheep in the open field, consumed  50 baskets of cut turnips per day, besides oil-cake. On putting them in  a shed, they were immediately able to consume only 30 baskets, and soon  after but 25, being only half the quantity required before, and yet they  fattened as rapidly as when eating the largest quantity. The minimum of  food, then, required for the support of animals, is attained when  closely confined in a warm, dark shelter; and the maximum, when running  at large, exposed to all weathers.      THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS.    This should be regulated by a variety of considerations. The young which  may be destined for maturity, should be supplied with milk from the dam  until weaning-time. No food can be substituted for the well-filled udder  of the parent, which is so safe, healthful, and nutritious. If from any  cause there is deficiency or total privation, it must be made up by that  kind of food, meal-gruel, &c., which, in its composition, approaches  nearest in quality to the milk. At a more advanced age, or the time for  weaning, grass, hay, roots, or grain, may be substituted, in quantities  sufficient to maintain a steady but _not a forced growth_. Stuffing can  only be tolerated in animals which are speedily destined for the  slaughter. Alternately improving and falling back, is injurious to all  stock. _An animal should never be fat but once._ Especially is high  feeding bad for breeding animals. Much as starving is to be deprecated,  the prejudicial effects of repletion are still greater. The calf or lamb  intended for the butcher, may be pushed forward with all possible  rapidity. Horses or colts should never exceed a good working or breeding  condition.      Purposes fulfilled by different Kinds of Food.    The objects designed to be answered by food, are to a certain extent the  same. All food is intended to meet the demands of respiration and  nutrition, and fattening to a greater or less degree. But some are  better suited to one object than others, and it is for the intelligent  farmer to select such as will most effectually accomplish his particular  purposes.    The very young animal requires large quantities of the phosphate of lime  for the formation of bone; and this is yielded in the milk in larger  proportions than from any other food. The growing animal wants bone,  muscle, and a certain amount of fat, and these are procured from the  grasses, roots, and grain; from the former when fed alone, and from the  two latter when mixed with hay or grass.    Horses, cattle, and sheep need hay to qualify the too watery nature of  the roots, and the too condensed nutritiveness of the grain. Animals  that are preparing for the shambles, require vegetable oils or fat,  starch, sugar, or gum. The first is contained in great abundance in flax  and cotton-seed, the sun-flower, and many other of the mucilaginous  seeds. Indian corn is the most fattening grain. The potato contains the  greatest proportion of starch, and the sugar-beet has large quantities  of sugar, and both consequently are good for stall-feeding. The ripe  sugar-cane is perhaps the most fattening of vegetables, if we except the  oily seeds and grain. The Swedes turnip is a good food to commence with  fattening cattle and sheep; but where great ripeness in animals is  desired, they should be followed with beets, carrots or potatoes, and  grain.    The table of the average composition of the different crops, which we  subjoin from Johnston, shows the comparative qualities of various kinds  of food, and it will be found a valuable reference for their nutritive  and fattening qualities."]]]
