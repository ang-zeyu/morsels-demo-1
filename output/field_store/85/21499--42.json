I have one means left whereby to judge of the value of my explanation,  namely, to experiment with tubes open at both ends and lying  horizontally. The horizontal position has a twofold advantage. In  the first place, it removes the insect from the influence of gravity,  inasmuch as it leaves it indifferent to the direction to be taken, the  right or the left. In the second place, it does away with the descent  of the rubbish which, falling under the worker's feet when the boring is  done from below, sooner or later discourages her and makes her abandon  her enterprise.    There are a few precautions to be observed for the successful conduct of  the experiment; I recommend them to any one who might care to make the  attempt. It is even advisable to remember them in the case of the tests  which I have already described. The males, those puny creatures, not  built for work, are sorry labourers when confronted with my stout disks.  Most of them perish miserably in their glass cells, without succeeding  in piercing their partitions right through. Moreover, instinct has been  less generous to them than to the females. Their corpses, interspersed  here and there in the series of the cells, are disturbing causes,  which it is wise to eliminate. I therefore choose the larger, more  powerful-looking cocoons. These, except for an occasional unavoidable  error, belong to females. I pack them in tubes, sometimes varying their  position in every way, sometimes giving them all a like arrangement.  It does not matter whether the whole series comes from one and the same  bramble-stump or from several: we are free to choose where we please;  the result will not be altered.    The first time that I prepared one of these horizontal tubes open at  both ends, I was greatly struck by what happened. The series consisted  of ten cocoons. It was divided into two equal batches. The five on the  left went out on the left, the five on the right went out on the right,  reversing, when necessary, their original direction in the cell. It was  very remarkable from the point of view of symmetry; moreover, it was  a very unlikely arrangement among the total number of possible  arrangements, as mathematics will show us.    Let us take n to represent the number of Osmiae. Each of them, once  gravity ceases to interfere and leaves the insect indifferent to either  end of the tube, is capable of two positions, according as she chooses  the exit on the right or on the left. With each of the two positions  of this first Osmia can be combined each of the two positions of the  second, giving us, in all, 2 x 2 = (2 squared) arrangements. Each of  these (2 squared) arrangements can be combined, in its turn, with each  of the two positions of the third Osmia. We thus obtain 2 x 2 x 2 = (2  cubed) arrangements with three Osmiae; and so on, each additional  insect multiplying the previous result by the factor 2. With n Osmiae,  therefore, the total number of arrangements is (2 to the power n.)    But note that these arrangements are symmetrical, two by two: a given  arrangement towards the right corresponds with a similar arrangement  towards the left; and this symmetry implies equality, for, in the  problem in hand, it is a matter of indifference whether a fixed  arrangement correspond with the right or left of the tube. The previous  number, therefore, must be divided by 2. Thus, n Osmiae, according as  each of them turns her head to the right or left in my horizontal tube,  are able to adopt (2 to the power n - 1) arrangements. If n = 10, as in  my first experiment, the number of arrangements becomes (2 to the power  9) = 512.    Consequently, out of 512 ways which my ten insects can adopt for their  outgoing position, there resulted one of those in which the symmetry  was most striking. And observe that this was not an effect obtained by  repeated attempts, by haphazard experiments. Each Osmia in the left half  had bored to the left, without touching the partition on the right; each  Osmia in the right half had bored to the right, without touching  the partition on the left. The shape of the orifices and the surface  condition of the partition showed this, if proof were necessary. There  had been a spontaneous decision, one half in favour of the left, one  half in favour of the right.    The arrangement presents another merit, one superior to that of  symmetry: it has the merit of corresponding with the minimum expenditure  of force. To admit of the exit of the whole series, if the string  consists of n cells, there are originally n partitions to be perforated.  There might even be one more, owing to a complication which I disregard.  There are, I say, at least n partitions to be perforated. Whether each  Osmia pierces her own, or whether the same Osmia pierces several, thus  relieving her neighbours, does not matter to us: the sum-total of the  force expended by the string of Bees will be in proportion to the number  of those partitions, in whatever manner the exit be effected.    But there is another task which we must take seriously into  consideration, because it is often more troublesome than the boring of  the partition: I mean the work of clearing a road through the wreckage.  Let us suppose the partitions pierced and the several chambers blocked  by the resulting rubbish and by that rubbish only, since the horizontal  position precludes any mixing of the contents of different chambers. To  open a passage for itself through these rubbish-heaps, each insect  will have the smallest effort to make if it passes through the smallest  possible number of cells, in short, if it makes for the opening nearest  to it. These smallest individual efforts amount, in the aggregate, to  the smallest total effort. Therefore, by proceeding as they did in my  experiment, the Osmiae effect their exit with the least expenditure of  energy. It is curious to see an insect apply the 'principle of least  action,' so often postulated in mechanics.    An arrangement which satisfies this principle, which conforms to the law  of symmetry and which possesses but one chance in 512, is certainly no  fortuitous result. It is determined by a cause; and, as this cause  acts invariably, the same arrangement must be reproduced if I renew the  experiment. I renewed it, therefore, in the years that followed, with as  many appliances as I could find bramble-stumps; and, at each new test, I  saw once more what I had seen with such interest on the first occasion.  If the number be even--and my column at that time consisted usually  of ten--one half goes out on the right, the other on the left. If the  number be odd--eleven, for instance--the Osmia in the middle goes out  indiscriminately by the right or left exit. As the number of cells to be  traversed is the same on both sides, her expenditure of energy does not  vary with the direction of the exit; and the principle of least action  is still observed.    It was important to discover if the Three-pronged Osmia shared her  capacity, in the first place, with the other bramble-dwellers and, in  the second, with Bees differently housed, but also destined laboriously  to cut a new road for themselves when the hour comes to quit the nest.  Well, apart from a few irregularities, due either to cocoons whose  larva perished in my tubes before developing, or to those inexperienced  workers, the males, the result was the same in the case of Anthidium  scapulare. The insects divided themselves into two equal batches, one  going to the right, the other to the left. Tripoxylon figulus left  me undecided. This feeble insect is not capable of perforating my  partitions; it nibbles at them a little; and I had to judge the  direction from the marks of its mandibles. These marks, which are not  always very plain, do not yet allow me to pronounce an opinion. Solenius  vagus, who is a skilful borer, behaved differently from the Osmia. In a  column of ten, the whole exodus was made in one direction.    On the other hand, I tested the Mason-bee of the Sheds, who, when  emerging under natural conditions, has only to pierce her cement ceiling  and is not confronted with a series of cells. Though a stranger to the  environment which I created for her, she gave me a most positive answer.  Of a column of ten laid in a horizontal tube open at both ends, five  made their way to the right and five to the left. Dioxys cincta, a  parasite in the buildings of both species of Mason-bees, the Chalicodoma  of the Sheds and the Chalicodoma of the Walls (Cf. \"The Mason-bees\"  by J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos:  passim.--Translator's Note.), provided me with no precise result.  The Leaf-cutting Bee (Megachile apicalis, SPIN. (Cf. Chapter 8 of the  present volume.--Translator's Note.)), who builds her leafy cups in the  old cells of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, acts like the Solenius and  directs her whole column towards the same outlet.    Incomplete as it is, this symmetry shows us how unwise it were to  generalize from the conclusions to which the Three-pronged Osmia leads  us. Whereas some Bees, such as the Anthidium and the Chalicodoma, share  the Osmia's talent for using the twofold exit, others, such as the  Solenius and the Leaf-cutter, behave like a flock of sheep and follow  the first that goes out. The entomological world is not all of a piece;  its gifts are very various: what one is capable of doing another cannot  do; and penetrating indeed would be the eyes that saw the causes of  these differences. Be this as it may, increased research will certainly  show us a larger number of species qualified to use the double outlet.  For the moment, we know three; and that is enough for our purpose.    I will add that, when the horizontal tube has one of its ends closed,  the whole string of Osmiae"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#6)"],[1,"for strengthening the muscles of the  spine, designed chiefly to exercise the muscles on either side of the  spine, consists of two wooden handles attached to india-rubber cords, one  of which is attached to a hook made fast in the ceiling, or in the top of  the door-case; and the other to another hook fastened in the wall,  door-post, or window-casing, about the height {35} of the shoulder. When  traction is made with the left hand, it exercises the muscles on the left  side of the spine, while those on the opposite side are left almost at  rest, owing to the oblique direction given to the shoulders when the right  hand grasps the horizontal cord. (This appliance will be understood by  referring to Fig. 13.)    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    {36}    27. Fig. 11 shows an appliance consisting of two strong elastic cords, with  handles, secured to a hook in the floor, so arranged that the patient has  to stoop forward to reach them. On raising the body the spinal muscles are  powerfully exercised. Fig. 12 shows other modes of using the elastic cords  for strengthening the spine and chest.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    28. These various appliances have been combined so as to form a system of  gymnastics suitable for parlor use; other appliances have been added by  which the muscles of {37} the legs may be called into action as well as  those of the spine and upper part of the body (Fig. 13). Combinations of  cords suitable for particular cases may also be made, and by using one or  several cords on the same hook, their power may be adapted to the strength  of the most robust as well as to that of the invalid, or of the most  delicate child. The entire apparatus is quite simple in its construction  and inexpensive, requiring but little space, and at the same time affording  a great variety of exercises.    EXERCISES THAT MAY BE PRACTISED ON THIS APPARATUS.        EXERCISE I. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect under the cords and place the heels      together. Grasp the handles firmly, keeping the knees and elbows stiff,      and pull downward and forward until the fingers nearly touch the toes.      Return slowly to the erect position. Repeat.        EXERCISE II. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect, and having grasped the handles      overhead firmly, separate them and bring them down slowly until they      touch the sides: then return them slowly to the original position.      Repeat.        EXERCISE III. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect, heels together, grasp the      handles overhead, and charge forward with the right foot. Return to      first position, and then charge with the left. Repeat, using the right      and left foot alternately.        EXERCISE IV. (Fig. 13).--Stand erect, heels together. Grasp the handle      overhead, and charge forward with the right foot, knee bent. Remain in      this position and bring the arms down to the sides so that the arm and      fore-arm may form a right angle. Still holding the handles, thrust      forward, first the right hand and then the left, until the arm is      straight. Repeat. Return to first position, then charge forward with      the left foot, performing the same movements as before.        EXERCISE V. (Fig. 13).--In this exercise we change to the pulleys      leading from the side posts, which can be used in several different      ways. 1st. Stand erect, heels together, facing one of the posts, grasp      the handle with the right hand, the arm being extended, then flex the      fore-arm on the arm. Repeat. Perform the same movements with the left      hand. 2d. Stand with back to the post; grasp the pulley behind with the      right hand, then gradually bring the hand forward until it is extended      in a straight line in front. Repeat. Perform the same exercise with the      left hand.        {38} EXERCISE VI. (Fig. 13).--This exercise is especially adapted to      the legs. Stirrups are so arranged that they can be attached to the      pulleys overhead, and can hang down to within three or four feet of the      floor. Place the foot in the stirrup, and then press down until it      touches the floor. Repeat. Exercise the left foot in the same way.        EXERCISE VII. (Fig. 13.)--This exercise requires a little attention in      the adjustment of the apparatus. Under the pulleys in the floor are      passed ropes which can be attached to the snap-hooks that hold the      handles overhead. Stoop forward with the knees stiff, and take hold of      the handles, and then raise the body to the erect position. Repeat.        EXERCISE VIII. (Fig. 13).--Sit on the floor or on a seat three or four      inches high; bend forward, take hold of the handles, and perform the      same movements that you would in rowing a boat.        EXERCISE IX. (Fig. 13).--The trapeze can now be let down; take hold of      it with both hands, sustaining the weight of the body with the arms,      then rotate the body first from right to left, then from left to right      alternately. This exercise is especially suitable for females.        EXERCISE X. (Fig. 13).--Grasp the trapeze as before, bearing all the      weight with the arms: then draw the body up slowly until you can place      the chin over the bars. This requires strength of muscle, and might      strain if done too violently; if slowly performed there is no danger.        These are but a few of the exercises that can be practised with this      apparatus. As these become familiar they can easily be modified, and      new ones can be arranged to meet the requirements of particular cases.      Most of the exercises described can be practised with one hand so as to      strengthen the muscles on one side.    [Sidenote: 29. Need of repose? How do we obtain rest? Alfred the Great? The  eight-hour division of time?]    29. REST.--We cannot always be active: repose must succeed labor. We obtain  this rest partly by suspending all exertion, as in sleep, and partly by a  change of employment. It is said that Alfred the Great recommended that  each day should be divided in the following manner: \"Eight hours for work,  eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for sleep.\" This division of  time is as good as any that could now be made, if it be borne in mind that,  when the work is physical, the time of recreation should {39} be devoted to  the improvement of the mind; and when mental, we should then recreate by  means of physical exercise.    [Sidenote: 30. Cessation of voluntary activity? Temperature of the body?  Consequence? Body and mind during sleep? Nutrition? Describe it.  Consequences of insufficient sleep?]    30. During sleep, all voluntary activity ceases, the rapidity of the  circulation and breathing diminishes, and the temperature of the body falls  one or two degrees. In consequence, the body needs warmer coverings than  during the hours of wakefulness. During sleep, the body seems wholly at  rest, and the mind is also inactive, if we except those involuntary mental  wanderings which we call dreams. Nevertheless a very active and important  physical process is going on. Nutrition, or the nourishing of the tissues,  now takes place. While the body is in action, the process of pulling down  predominates, but in sleep, that of building up takes place more actively.  In this way we are refreshed each night, and prepared for the work and  pleasures of another day. If sleep is insufficient, the effects are seen in  the lassitude and weakness which follow. Wakefulness is very frequently the  forerunner of insanity, especially among those who perform excessive mental  labor.    [Sidenote: 31. Amount of sleep in different persons? Cases? Frederick the  Great? Bonaparte? Instances of long deprivation of sleep?]    31. All persons do not require the same amount of sleep, but the average of  men need from seven to nine hours. There are well-authenticated cases where  individuals have remained without sleep for many days without apparent  injury. Frederick the Great required only five hours of sleep daily.  Bonaparte could pass days with only a few hours of rest. But this long  continued absence of sleep is attended with danger. After loss of sleep for  a long period, in some instances, stupor has come on so profoundly, that  there has been no awaking.    [Sidenote: 32. Instances of sailors? French soldiers? During torture?]    32. There are instances related of sailors falling asleep {40} on the  gun-deck of their ships while in action. On the retreat from Moscow, the  French soldiers would fall asleep on the march, and could only be aroused  by the cry, \"The Cossacks are coming!\" Tortured persons are said to have  slept upon the rack in the intervals of their torture. In early life, while  engaged in a laborious country practice, the writer not unfrequently slept  soundly on horseback. These instances, and others, show the imperative  demand which nature makes for rest in sleep.
