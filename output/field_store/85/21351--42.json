Accordingly the flotilla was directed for the Gulf of Salerno, but  within sight of the island of Capri a violent storm broke over it, and  drove it as far as Paola, a little seaport situated ten miles from  Cosenza. Consequently the vessels were anchored for the night of the 5th  of October in a little indentation of the coast not worthy of the name  of a roadstead. The king, to remove all suspicion from the coastguards  and the Sicilian scorridori, [Small vessels fitted up as ships-of-war.]  ordered that all lights should be extinguished and that the vessels  should tack about during the night; but towards one o'clock such a  violent land-wind sprang up that the expedition was driven out to sea,  so that on the 6th at dawn the king's vessel was alone.    During the morning they overhauled Captain Cicconi's felucca, and the  two ships dropped anchor at four o'clock in sight of Santo-Lucido. In  the evening the king commanded Ottoviani, a staff officer, to go ashore  and reconnoitre. Luidgi offered to accompany him. Murat accepted his  services. So Ottoviani and his guide went ashore, whilst Cicconi and his  felucca put out to sea in search of the rest of the fleet.    Towards eleven o'clock at night the lieutenant of the watch descried a  man in the waves swimming to the vessel. As soon as he was within  hearing the lieutenant hailed him. The swimmer immediately made himself  known: it was Luidgi. They put out the boat, and he came on board. Then  he told them that Ottoviani had been arrested, and he had only escaped  himself by jumping into the sea. Murat's first idea was to go to the  rescue of Ottoviani; but Luidgi made the king realise the danger and  uselessness of such an attempt; nevertheless, Joachim remained agitated  and irresolute until two o'clock in the morning.    At last he gave the order to put to sea again. During the manoeuvre  which effected this a sailor fell overboard and disappeared before they  had time to help him. Decidedly these were ill omens.    On the morning of the 7th two vessels were in sight. The king gave the  order to prepare for action, but Barbara recognised them as Cicconi's  felucca and Courrand's lugger, which had joined each other and were  keeping each other company. They hoisted the necessary signals, and the  two captains brought up their vessels alongside the admiral's.    While they were deliberating as to what route to follow, a boat came up  to Murat's vessel. Captain Pernice was on board with a lieutenant. They  came to ask the king's permission to board his ship, not wishing to  remain on Courrand's, for in their opinion he was a traitor.    Murat sent to fetch him, and in spite of his protestations he was made  to descend into a boat with fifty men, and the boat was moored to the  vessel. The order was carried out at once, and the little squadron  advanced, coasting along the shores of Calabria without losing sight of  them; but at ten o'clock in the evening, just as they came abreast of  the Gulf of Santa-Eufemia, Captain Courrand cut the rope which moored  his boat to the vessel, and rowed away from the fleet.    Murat had thrown himself on to his bed without undressing; they brought  him the news.    He rushed up to the deck, and arrived in time to see the boat, which was  fleeing in the direction of Corsica, grow small and vanish in the  distance. He remained motionless, not uttering a cry, giving no signs of  rage; he only sighed and let his head fall on his breast: it was one  more leaf falling from the exhausted tree of his hopes.    General Franceschetti profited by this hour of discouragement to advise  him not to land in Calabria, and to go direct to Trieste, in order to  claim from Austria the refuge which had been offered.    The king was going through one of those periods of extreme exhaustion,  of mortal depression, when courage quite gives way: he refused flatly at  first, and there at last agreed to do it.    Just then the general perceived a sailor lying on some coils of ropes,  within hearing of all they said; he interrupted himself, and pointed him  out to Murat.    The latter got up, went to see the man, and recognised Luidgi; overcome  with exhaustion, he had fallen asleep on deck. The king satisfied  himself that the sleep was genuine, and besides he had full confidence  in the man. The conversation, which had been interrupted for a moment,  was renewed: it was agreed that without saying anything about the new  plans, they would clear Cape Spartivento and enter the Adriatic; then  the king and the general went below again to the lower deck.    The next day, the 8th October, they found themselves abreast of Pizzo,  when Joachim, questioned by Barbara as to what he proposed to do, gave  the order to steer for Messina. Barbara answered that he was ready to  obey, but that they were in need of food and water; consequently he  offered to go on, board Cicconi's vessel and to land with him to get  stores. The king agreed; Barbara asked for the passports which he had  received from the allied powers, in order, he said, not to be molested  by the local authorities.    These documents were too important for Murat to consent to part with  them; perhaps the king was beginning to suspect: he refused. Barbara  insisted; Murat ordered him to land without the papers; Barbara flatly  refused.    The king, accustomed to being obeyed, raised his riding-whip to strike  the Maltese, but, changing his resolution, he ordered the soldiers to  prepare their arms, the officers to put on full uniform; he himself set  the example. The disembarkation was decided upon, and Pizzo was to  become the Golfe Juan of the new Napoleon.    Consequently the vessels were steered for land. The king got down into a  boat with twenty-eight soldiers and three servants, amongst whom was  Luidgi. As they drew near the shore General Franceschetti made a  movement as if to land, but Murat stopped him.    \"It is for me to land first,\" he said, and he sprang on shore.    He was dressed in a general's coat, white breeches and riding-boots, a  belt carrying two pistols, a gold-embroidered hat with a cockade  fastened in with a clasp made of fourteen brilliants, and lastly he  carried under his arm the banner round which he hoped to rally his  partisans. The town clock of Pizzo struck ten. Murat went straight up to  the town, from which he was hardly a hundred yards distant. He followed  the wide stone staircase which led up to it.    It was Sunday. Mass was about to be celebrated, and the whole population  had assembled in the Great Square when he arrived. No one recognised  him, and everyone gazed with astonishment at the fine officer. Presently  he saw amongst the peasants a former sergeant of his who had served in  his guard at Naples. He walked straight up to him and put his hand on  the man's shoulder.    \"Tavella,\" he said, \"don't you recognise me?\"    But as the man made no answer:    \"I am Joachim Murat, I am your king,\" he said. \"Yours be the honour to  shout 'Long live Joachim!' first.\"    Murat's suite instantly made the air ring with acclamations, but the  Calabrians remained silent, and not one of his comrades took up the cry  for which the king himself had given the signal; on the contrary, a low  murmur ran through the crowd. Murat well understood this forerunner of  the storm.    \"Well,\" he said to Tavella, \"if you won't cry 'Long live Joachim!' you  can at least fetch me a horse, and from sergeant I will promote you to  be captain.\"    Tavella walked away without answering, but instead of carrying out the  king's behest, went into his house, and did not appear again.    In the meantime the people were massing together without evincing any of  the sympathy that the king had hoped for. He felt that he was lost if he  did not act instantly.    \"To Monteleone!\" he cried, springing forward towards the road which led  to that town.    \"To Monteleone!\" shouted his officers and men, as they followed him.    And the crowd, persistently silent, opened to let them pass.    But they had hardly left the square before a great disturbance broke  out. A man named Giorgio Pellegrino came out of his house with a gun and  crossed the square, shouting, \"To your arms!\"    He knew that Captain Trenta Capelli commanding the Cosenza garrison was  just then in Pizzo, and he was going to warn him.    The cry \"To arms!\" had more effect on the crowd than the cry \"Long live  Joachim!\"    Every Calabrian possesses a gun, and each one ran to fetch his, and when  Trenta Capelli and Giorgio Pellegrino came back to the square they found  nearly two hundred armed men there.    They placed themselves at the head of the column, and hastened forward  in pursuit of the king; they came up with him about ten minutes from the  square, where the bridge is nowadays. Seeing them, Murat stopped and  waited for them.    Trenta Capelli advanced, sword in hand, towards the king.    \"Sir,\" said the latter, \"will you exchange your captain's epaulettes for  a general's? Cry 'Long live Joachim!' and follow me with these brave  fellows to Monteleone.\"    \"Sire,\" said Trenta Capelli, \"we are the faithful subjects of King  Ferdinand, and we come to fight you, and not to bear you company. Give  yourself up, if you would prevent bloodshed.\"    Murat looked at the captain with an expression which it would be  impossible to describe; then without deigning to answer, he signed to  Cagelli to move away, while his other hand went to his pistol. Giotgio  Pellegrino perceived the movement.    \"Down, captain, down!\" he cried. The captain obeyed. Immediately a  bullet whistled over his head and brushed Murat's head.    \"Fire!\" commanded Franceschetti.    \"Down with your arms!\" cried Murat.
