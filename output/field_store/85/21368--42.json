The late Henry Wolfsohn, one of the greatest managers America has ever  produced, told the writer frequently that the task of introducing a new  artist was one of the most thankless and uncertain undertakings  imaginable.    Does the work, the time, the expense frighten you, little miss at the  keyboard? Do you fear the grind, the grueling disappoints, the unceasing  sacrifices? Then abandon your great career and join the army of useful  music workers who are teaching the young people of the land to love  music as it should be loved,--not in hysterical outbursts in the concert  hall but in the home circle. If you have the unextinguishable fire  within your soul, if you have the talent from on high, if you have  health, energy, system, vitality, nothing can stop you from becoming  great. Advice, interferences, obstacles will be nothing to you. You will  work day and night to reach your goal. What better guide could you  possibly have than the words of the great pianists themselves? While  the ensuing pages were compiled with the view of helping the amateur  performer quite as much as the student who would become a professional  pianist, you will nevertheless find in the expressions of the really  great virtuosos a wealth of information and practical advice.    Most of the following chapters are the results of many different  conferences with the greatest living pianists. All have had the revision  of the artists in person before publication was undertaken. In order to  indicate how carefully and willingly this was done by the pianists it is  interesting to note the case of the great Russian composer-virtuoso  Rachmaninoff. The original conference was conducted in German and in  French. The material was arranged in manuscript form in English. M.  Rachmaninoff then requested a second conference. In the mean time he had  had the better part of the manuscript translated into his native  Russian. However, in order to insure accuracy in the use of words, the  writer translated the entire matter back into German in the pianist's  presence. M. Rachmaninoff did not speak English and the writer did not  speak Russian.    The chapter relating to Harold Bauer is the result of a conference  conducted in English. Mr. Bauer's use of his native tongue is as fluent  and eloquent as a poet or an orator. In order that his ideas might have  the best possible expression the entire chapter was written several  times in manuscript and carefully rearranged and rephrased by Mr. Bauer  in person.    Some of the conferences lasted well on through the night. The writer's  twenty years' experience in teaching was constantly needed to grasp  different shadings of meaning that some pianists found difficult to  phrase. Many indeed have felt their weakness in the art of verbal  expression and have rejoiced to have their ideas clothed with fitting  words. Complete frankness and sincerity were encouraged in every case.  The results of the conference with Wilhelm Bachaus, conceded by many  other pianists to be the foremost \"technicalist\" of the day, are, it  will be observed, altogether different in the statement of teaching  principles from those of Harold Bauer. Each is a sincere expression of  individual opinion and the thoughtful student by weighing the ideas of  both may reach conclusions immensely to his personal advantage.    No wider range of views upon the subject of pianoforte playing could  possibly come between the covers of a book. The student, the teacher,  and the music lover who acquaints himself with the opinions of the  different masters of the keyboard can not fail to have a very clear  insight into the best contemporary ideas upon technic, interpretation,  style and expression. The author--or shall he call himself a  collector?--believes that the use of the questions following each  chapter will be found practical and useful in the work of both clubs and  classes. Practice, however, is still more important than precept. The  student might easily learn this book \"by heart\" and yet be unable to  play a perfect scale. Let him remember the words of Locke:        \"Men of much reading are greatly learned: but may be little knowing.\"    After all, the virtuoso is great because he really knows and W-O-R-K-S.          PEPITO ARRIOLA    BIOGRAPHICAL      Pepito Arriola was born on the 14th of December, 1897. A careful  investigation of his ancestry reveals that no less than twelve of his  forefathers and relations have been pronouncedly musical. His father was  a physician, but his mother was a musician. His early musical training  was given to him exclusively by his mother. The following was prepared  when he was twelve years old and at that time he was apparently a  perfectly healthy child, with the normal activity of a boy of his age  and with a little more general education in addition to his music than  the average child at fifteen or sixteen possesses. He spoke French,  German (fluently) and Spanish, but little English. Despite the fact that  he had received numerous honors from European monarchs and famous  musicians, he was exceptionally modest. In his playing he seemed never  to miss a note in even very complicated compositions and his musical  maturity and point of view were truly astonishing. The following is  particularly valuable from an educational standpoint, because of the  absolute unaffectedness of the child's narrative of his own training.    (The following conference was conducted in German and French.)    [Illustration: PEPITO ARRIOLA]          III    THE STORY OF A WONDER CHILD    PEPITO ARRIOLA      MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTIONS    So much that was of interest to me was continually occurring while I was  a child that it all seems like a kind of haze to me. I cannot remember  when I first commenced to play, for my mother tells me that I wanted to  reach out for the keyboard before I was out of her arms. I have also  learned that when I was about two and one-half years of age, I could  quite readily play after my mother anything that the size of my hand  would permit me to play.    I loved music so dearly, and it was such fun to run over the keyboard  and make the pretty sounds, that the piano was really my first and best  toy. I loved to hear my mother play, and continually begged her to play  for me so that I could play the same pieces after her. I knew nothing of  musical notation and played entirely by ear, which seemed to me the most  natural way to play. At that time, word was sent to the King of Spain  that I showed talent, and he became interested in me, and I played  before him.      MY FRIENDSHIP WITH ARTHUR NIKISCH    A short time afterward, Herr Arthur Nikisch, conductor of the  _Gewandhaus_ Orchestra at Leipsic, and at one time conductor of the  Boston Symphony Orchestra in America, came to Madrid to conduct the  Philharmonic Orchestra for a special concert. Some one told him about my  playing and I was permitted to play for him. He became so interested  that he insisted upon my being taken to Leipsic for further study. I was  then four years of age, and although musical advantages in Spain are  continually increasing, my mother thought it best at the time that she  should follow the great musician's advice and that I should be taken to  the German city.    I want to say that in my earliest work, my mother made no effort to push  me or urge me to go ahead. I loved to play for the sake of playing, and  needed no coaxing to spend time at the keyboard. In my very early years  I was permitted to play in public very little, although there were  constant demands made to engage me. I was looked upon as a kind of  curiosity and my mother wanted me to study in the regular way with good  masters, and also to acquire more strength before I played in public  very much.    I did, however, play at the great Albert Hall, in London. The big  building holds 8000 people, but that was so long ago that I have almost  forgotten all about it, except that they all seemed pleased to see a  little boy of four playing in so very big a place. I also played for  royal personages, including the Kaiser of Germany, who was very good to  me and gave me a beautiful pin. I like the Kaiser very much. He seems  like a fine man.      MY FIRST REGULAR INSTRUCTION    My first teacher, aside from my mother, was a Herr Dreckendorf, of  Leipsic. He was very kind to me and took the greatest pains, but the  idea of learning the notes was very distasteful to me. I was terribly  bored with the technical exercises he gave me, but have since learned  that one can save much time by practicing scales and exercises. Although  I do not like them, I practice them every day now, for a little while,  so as to get my fingers in good working order.    In about six weeks I knew all that was expected of me in the way of  scales in octaves, sixths, thirds, double thirds, etc., and my teacher  commenced to turn his attention to studies and pieces. For the first  time I found musical notation interesting, for then I realized that it  was not necessary for me to wait until some one else played a piece  before I could begin to explore its beauties. Ah! it was wonderful,  those first days with the pieces. I was in a new country and could  hardly wait to master one at a time, so eager was I to reach the next  one and see just what it was like.    Herr Dreckendorf gave me some studies by Dussek, Cramer, the  _Inventions_ of Bach, etc., but before long the fascination of playing  beautiful pieces was so great that he found it hard to keep me away from  them.      EARLY REPERTORY    So hungry was I to find new musical works that when I was eight and a  half years old I could play from memory such pieces as the B flat minor  Scherzo, the A flat major Polonaise, and most of the Valses and Etudes  of Chopin. I also played the Sixth Rhapsody of Liszt and the C minor  Concerto"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#6)"],[1," the  gratitude and admiration of her country and mankind by her  self-sacrifice and her powers of organization. Rev. Henry Kinglake, in  his \"History of the Crimea,\" says she brought a priceless  reinforcement of brain power to the nation at a time when the brains  of Englishmen had given signs of inanition.    A few years later brought our own civil war, and the wonderful  sanitary commission, more familiarly known as \"The Sanitary,\" the  public records of which are a part of the history of the war; its  sacrifices and its successes have burned themselves deep into the  hearts of thousands upon thousands. Its fairs in New York, New  England, and the Northwest, were the wonders of the world in the  variety and beauty of their exhibits and the vast sums realized from  them. Scarcely a woman in the nation, from the girl of tender  years,[12] to the aged matron of ninety, whose trembling hands scraped  lint or essayed to knit socks and mittens for \"the boys in blue,\" but  knows its work, for of it they were a part. But not a hundred of all  those thousands who toiled with willing hands, and who, at every  battle met anew to prepare or send off stores, knows that to one of  her own sex was the formation of the Great Sanitary due.[13]    Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, returning to this country from England about  the time of the breaking out of the war, fresh from an acquaintance  with Miss Nightingale, and filled with her enthusiasm, at once called  an informal meeting at the New York Infirmary[14] for Women and  Children, where, on April 25th, 1861, the germ of the sanitary, known  as the Ladies' Central Relief,[15] was inaugurated. A public meeting  was held April 26, 1861, at the Cooper Union, its object being to  concentrate scattered efforts by a large and formal organization. The  society then received the name of the \"Woman's Central Relief  Association of New York.\" Miss Louisa Lee Schuyler was chosen its  president. She soon sent out an appeal to women which brought New York  into direct connection with many other portions of the country,  enabling it \"to report its monthly disbursements by tens of thousands,  and the sum total of its income by millions.\" But very soon after its  organization, Miss Schuyler saw the need of more positive connection  with the Government. A united address was sent to the Secretary of War  from the Woman's Central Relief Association, the Advisory Committee of  the Board of Physicians and Surgeons of the hospitals of New York, and  the New York Medical Association for furnishing medical supplies. As  the result of this address, the Sanitary Commission was established  the 9th of June, 1861, under the authority of the Government, and went  into immediate operation. Although acting under Government  authorization, this commission was not sustained at Government  expense, but was supported by the women of the nation. It was  organized under the following general rules:         1. The system of sanitary relief established by army regulations       was to be adopted; the Sanitary Commission was to acquaint itself       fully with those rules, and see that its agents were familiar       with all the plans and methods of the army system.         2. The Commission was to direct its efforts mainly to       strengthening the regular army system, and work to secure the       favor and co-operation of the Medical Bureau.         3. The Commission was to know nothing of religious differences or       State distinctions, distributing without regard to the place       where troops were enlisted, in a purely national spirit.    Under these provisions the Sanitary Commission completed its full  organization. Dr. Blackwell, in the Ladies' Relief Association, acted  as Chairman of the Registration Committee, a position of onerous  duties, requiring accord with the Medical Bureau and War Department,  and visited Washington in behalf of this committee. But the  Association soon lost her services by her own voluntary act of  withdrawal. Professional jealousy of women doctors being offensively  shown by some of those male physicians with whom she was brought in  contact, she chose to resign rather than allow sex-prejudice to  obstruct the carrying on of the great work originated by her. The  Sanitary, with its Auxiliary Aid Societies, at once presented a method  of help to the loyal[16] women of the country, and every city,  village, and hamlet soon poured its resources into the Commission.  Through it $92,000,000 were raised in aid of the sick and wounded of  the army. Nothing connected with the war so astonished foreign nations  as the work of the Sanitary Commission.    Dr. Henry Bellows, its President at the close of the war, declared in  his farewell address, that the army of women at home had been as  patriotic and as self-sacrificing as the army of men in the field, and  had it not been for their aid the war could not have been brought to a  successful termination.[17]    At every important period in the nation's history, woman has stood by  the side of man in duties. Husband, father, son, or brother have not  suffered or sacrificed alone.        \"The old Continentals      In their ragged regimentals      Faltered not,\"    because back of them stood the patriotic women of the thirteen  Colonies; those of the north-eastern pine-woods, who aided in the  first naval battle of the Revolution; those of Massachusetts,  Daughters of Liberty, who formed anti-tea leagues, proclaimed inherent  rights, and demanded an independency in advance of the men; those of  New York, who tilled the fields, and, removing their hearth-stones,  manufactured saltpetre from the earth beneath, to make powder for the  army; those of New Jersey, who rebuked traitors; those of  Pennsylvania, who saved the army; those of Virginia, who protested  against taxation without representation; those of South Carolina, who  at Charleston established a paper in opposition to the Stamp Act;  those of North Carolina, whose fiery patriotism secured for the  counties of Rowan and Mecklenberg the derisive name of \"The Hornet's  Nest of America.\" The women of the whole thirteen Colonies everywhere  showed their devotion to freedom and their choice of liberty with  privation, rather than oppression with luxury and ease.    The civil war in our own generation was but an added proof of woman's  love for freedom and her worthiness of its possession. The grandest  war poem, \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" was the echo of a woman's  voice,[18] while woman's prescience and power were everywhere  manifested. She saw, before President, Cabinet, generals, or Congress,  that slavery must die before peace could be established in the  country.[19] Months previous to the issue by the President of the  Emancipation Proclamation, women in humble homes were petitioning  Congress for the overthrow of slavery, and agonizing in spirit because  of the dilatoriness of those in power. Were proof of woman's love of  freedom, of her right to freedom needed, the history of our civil war  would alone be sufficient to prove that love, to establish that right.      WOMEN AS SOLDIERS.    Many women fought in the ranks during the war, impelled by the same  patriotic motives which led their fathers, husbands, and brothers into  the contest. Not alone from one State, or in one regiment, but from  various parts of the Union, women were found giving their services and  lives to their country among the rank and file of the army.[20]  Although the nation gladly summoned their aid in camp and hospital,  and on the battle-field with the ambulance corps, it gave them no  recognition as soldiers, even denying them the rights of  chaplaincy,[21] and by \"army regulations\" entirely refusing them  recognition as part of the fighting forces of the country.    Historians have made no mention of woman's services in the war;  scarcely referring to the vast number commissioned in the army, whose  sex was discovered through some terrible wound, or by their dead  bodies on the battle-field. Even the volumes especially devoted to an  account of woman's work in the war, have mostly ignored her as a  common soldier, although the files of the newspapers of that heroic  period, if carefully examined, would be found to contain many accounts  of women who fought on the field of battle.[22]    Gov. Yates, of Illinois, commissioned the wife of Lieut. Reynolds of  the 17th, as Major, for service in the field, the document being made  out with due formality, having attached to it the great seal of State.  President Lincoln, more liberal than the Secretary of War, himself  promoted the wife of another Illinois officer, named Gates, to a  majorship, for service in the hospital and bravery on the field.    One young girl is referred to who served in seven different regiments,  participated in several engagements, was twice severely wounded; had  been discovered and mustered out of service eight times, but as many  times had re-enlisted, although a Canadian by birth, being determined  to fight for the American Union.    Hundreds of women marched steadily up to the mouth of a hundred cannon  pouring out fire and smoke, shot and shell, mowing down the advancing  hosts like grass; men, horses, and colors going down in confusion,  disappearing in clouds of smoke; the only sound, the screaming of  shells, the crackling of musketry, the thunder of artillery, through  all this women were sustained by the enthusiasm born of love of  country and liberty.        Amid \"sighing shot and shrieking shell      And the splintered fire of the shattered hell,      And the great white breaths of the cannon smoke      As the growling guns by the battery spoke.        .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .        Right up to the guns, black-throated and grim,      Right down on the hedges bordered with steel,\"    bravely marched hundreds of women.    Nor was the war without its naval heroines.
