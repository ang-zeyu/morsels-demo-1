Pray God not to  lead you into temptation.\"    Then she scolded her daughter severely and went out, slamming the door  after her. That same day a carriage drove into the village, and some  gentlemen invited mother and daughter to share the bread of the lord  of the manor. The mother considered such an offer a great honour, but  the daughter refused it and replied to the gentlemen scornfully: \"Even  if you had come to fetch me in a carriage of solid silver and had  presented me with a golden diadem, I would never have consented to be  the wife of your lord.\"    The gentlemen turned away in disgust and returned home; the mother  rebuked her severely for so much pride.    \"Miserable, foolish girl!\" she cried, \"pride is a breath from hell. It  is your duty to be humble, honest, and sweet-tempered.\"    The daughter replied by a laugh.    The third night she slept soundly, but the poor woman at her side  could not close her eyes. Tormented with dark forebodings, she feared  some misfortune was about to happen, and counted her beads, praying  fervently. All at once the young sleeper began to sneer and laugh.    \"Merciful God! ah me!\" cried the poor woman, \"what are these dreams  that worry her poor brain!\"    In the morning she said, \"What made you sneer so frightfully last  night? You must have had bad dreams again, my poor child.\"    \"Now, mother, you look as if you were going to preach again.\"    \"No, no; but I want to know what you were dreaming about.\"    \"Well, I dreamt some one drove up in a golden carriage and asked me to  marry him, and he brought me a mantle of cloth of pure gold. When we  came into church, the crowd pressed forward to kneel before me.\"    The mother wrung her hands piteously, and the girl left the room to  avoid hearing her lamentations. That same day three carriages entered  the yard, one of brass, one of silver, and one of gold. The first was  drawn by two, the second by three, the third by four magnificent  horses. Gentlemen wearing scarlet gloves and green mantles got out of  the brass and silver carriages, while from the golden carriage  alighted a prince who, as the sun shone on him, looked as if he were  dressed in gold. They all made their way to the widow and asked for  her daughter's hand.    \"I fear we are not worthy of so much honour,\" replied the widow  meekly, but when the daughter's eyes fell upon her suitor she  recognised in him the lover of her dreams, and withdrew to weave an  aigrette of many-coloured feathers. In exchange for this aigrette  which she offered her bridegroom, he placed upon her finger a ring set  with stones that shone like the stars in heaven, and over her  shoulders a mantle of cloth of gold. The young bride, beside herself  with joy, retired to complete her toilette. Meanwhile the anxious  mother, a prey to the blackest forebodings, said to her son-in-law,  \"My daughter has consented to share your bread, tell me of what sort  of flour it is made?\"    [Illustration]    \"In our house we have bread of brass, of silver, and of gold; my wife  will be free to choose.\"    Such a reply astonished her more than ever, and made her still more  unhappy. The daughter asked no questions, was in fact content to know  nothing, not even what her mother suffered. She looked magnificent in  her bridal attire and golden mantle, but she left her home with the  prince without saying good-bye either to her mother or to her youthful  companions. Neither did she ask her mother's blessing, though the  latter wept and prayed for her safety.    After the marriage ceremony they mounted the golden carriage and set  off, followed by the attendants of silver and brass. The procession  moved slowly along the road without stopping until it reached the foot  of a high rock. Here, instead of a carriage entrance, was a large  cavern which led out into a steep slope down which the horses went  lower and lower. The giant _Zemo-tras_ (he who makes the earthquakes)  closed the opening with a huge stone. They made their way in darkness  for some time, the terrified bride being reassured by her husband.    \"Fear nothing,\" said he, \"in a little while it will be clear and  beautiful.\"    Grotesque dwarfs, carrying lighted torches, appeared on all sides,  saluted and welcomed their King Kovlad as they illumined the road for  him and his attendants. Then for the first time the girl knew she had  married Kovlad, but this mattered little to her. On coming out from  these gloomy passages into the open they found themselves surrounded  by large forests and mountains, mountains that seemed to touch the  sky. And, strange to relate, all the trees of whatsoever kind, and  even the mountains that seemed to touch the sky, were of solid lead.  When they had crossed these marvellous mountains the giant Zemo-tras  closed all the openings in the road they had passed. They then drove  out upon vast and beautiful plains, in the centre of which was a  golden palace covered with precious stones. The bride was weary with  looking at so many wonders, and gladly sat down to the feast prepared  by the dwarfs. Meats of many kinds were served, roast and boiled, but  lo! they were of metal--brass, silver, and gold. Every one ate  heartily and enjoyed the food, but the young wife, with tears in her  eyes, begged for a piece of bread.    \"Certainly, madam, with pleasure,\" answered Kovlad. But she could not  eat the bread which was brought, for it was of brass. Then the king  sent for a piece of silver bread, still she could not eat it; and  again for a slice of golden bread, that too she was unable to bite.  The servants did all they could to get something to their mistress's  taste, but she found it impossible to eat anything.    \"I should be most happy to gratify you,\" said Kovlad \"but we have no  other kind of food.\"    Then she realised for the first time in whose power she had placed  herself, and she began to weep bitterly and wish she had taken her  mother's advice.    \"It is of no use to weep and regret,\" said Kovlad, \"you must have  known the kind of bread you would have to break here; your wish has  been fulfilled.\"    And so it was, for nothing can recall the past. The wretched girl was  obliged henceforth to live underground with her husband Kovlad, the  God of Metals, in his golden palace. And this because she had set her  heart upon nothing but the possession of gold, and had never wished  for anything better.          [Illustration]    II    THE LOST CHILD      Long long ago there lived a very rich nobleman. But though he was so  rich he was not happy, for he had no children to whom he could leave  his wealth. He was, besides, no longer young. Every day he and his  wife went to church to pray for a son. At last, after long waiting,  God sent them what they desired. Now the evening before its arrival  the father dreamed that its chance of living would depend upon one  condition, namely, that its feet never touched the earth until it was  twelve years old. Great care was taken that this should be avoided,  and when the little stranger came, only trustworthy nurses were  employed to look after him. As the years passed on the child was  diligently guarded, sometimes he was carried in his nurses' arms,  sometimes rocked in his golden cradle, but his feet never touched the  ground.    Now when the end of the time drew near the father began preparations  for a magnificent feast which should be given to celebrate his son's  release. One day while these were in progress a frightful noise,  followed by most unearthly yells, shook the castle. The nurse dropped  the child in her terror and ran to the window: that instant the noises  ceased. On turning to take up the boy, imagine her dismay when she  found him no longer there, and remembered that she had disobeyed her  master's orders.    Hearing her screams and lamentations, all the servants of the castle  ran to her. The father soon followed, asking, \"What is the matter?  What has happened? Where is my child?\" The nurse, trembling and  weeping, told of the disappearance of his son, his only child. No  words can tell the anguish of the father's heart. He sent servants in  every direction to hunt for his boy, he gave orders, he begged and  prayed, he threw away money right and left, he promised everything if  only his son might be restored to him. Search was made without loss of  time, but no trace of him could be discovered; he had vanished as  completely as if he had never existed.    Many years later the unhappy nobleman learnt that in one of the most  beautiful rooms of the castle, footsteps, as of some one walking up  and down, and dismal groans, were heard every midnight. Anxious to  follow the matter up, for he thought it might in some way concern his  lost son, he made known that a reward of three hundred gold pieces  would be given to any one who would watch for one whole night in the  haunted room. Many were willing, but had not the courage to stay till  the end; for at midnight, when the dismal groans were heard, they  would run away rather than risk their lives for three hundred gold  pieces. The poor father was in despair, and knew not how to discover  the truth of this dark mystery.    Now close to the castle dwelt a widow, a miller by trade, who had  three daughters. They were very poor, and hardly earned enough for  their daily needs. When they heard of the midnight noises in the  castle and the promised reward, the eldest daughter said, \"As we are  so very poor we have nothing to lose; surely we might try to earn  these three hundred gold pieces by remaining in the room one night. I  should like to try, mother, if you will let me.\"    The mother shrugged her shoulders, she hardly knew what to say; but  when she thought of their poverty and the difficulty they had to earn  a living she gave permission for her eldest daughter to remain one  night in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#6)"],[1,"a very observing naturalist, of one of these  variations in the pointer's instinct, which may, by careful  selection, possibly lead to a very useful change in the habits of  the animal. Hunting the Virginia partridge in the tall grass on the  sea-coast of Georgia, his dog found by experience that his master  could not discern him when he was pointing birds, and that a yelp of  impatience would put up the covey before the gun was ready for them.  The sagacious dog, therefore, adopted the habit of backing away from  the point where he first fixed himself, so that he, by barking,  denoted the presence of the birds without giving them alarm.  Although, in this first instance, the action is purely rational, and  is indeed good evidence of singular discernment and contriving  skill, it seems likely that by careful breeding it may be brought  into the realm of pure instinct or inherited habit.    The great variation in habits which is taking place in those varieties  of dogs which are immediately under the master's eye during all the  process of the chase, is easily explained by the fact that these  creatures are in a position to be immediately and constantly  influenced during their most active, and therefore teachable state of  mind, by the will of man. A pack of fox-hounds is, to a great extent,  out of hand while engaged in the pursuit of their prey; but a pointer  or setter, even when under extreme excitement, is almost completely  mastered by the superior will. When we observe the extent to which  human intelligence is affecting the qualities of our hunting-dogs, it  is not surprising to note that, in almost every district where there  are peculiar kinds of game, varieties of the dog are developing which  are especially adapted to its pursuit. Thus, in the parts of North  America where the raccoon abounds, a variety of hunting-dog is in  process of development which has a singular assemblage of qualities  which fit it for this peculiar form of the chase. Although as yet  \"coon-dogs\" have not been cultivated for a sufficient time to acquire  distinct physical characteristics, their habits exhibit a larger range  of specialization than those of any other breed of sporting dogs.    In those parts of the Americas where peccaries are hunted, the dogs  used in their pursuit have learned to beware of assaulting the pack  which they have brought to bay, and instead of indulging in the  instinct which leads them into that way of danger and of certain  death, they circle round the assemblage, compelling them to show front  on every side and so to remain stationary until the hunters come up.  Perhaps a score of similar specializations in the modes of action of  our dogs which are employed in the chase could be recited; but as they  all lead us to one conclusion--which is to the effect that these  creatures are, as far as their mental powers are concerned, like clay  in the hands of the potter--we may pass them by for some  considerations which appear to have escaped the attention of writers  who have discussed the problems of canine intelligence.    The singular elasticity as regards both mental and physical qualities  which the dog exhibits, may well be compared with the other conditions  which we find in certain of our domesticated animals, as, for instance,  in the horse, where the mind shows but slight changes, and where the  body has proved far less plastic than among dogs. The readiness with  which the proportions of the dog may, by the breeder's art, be made to  vary, is probably due to the fact that the group to which this creature  belongs is one of relatively modern institution. It has the plasticity  which we note as a characteristic of many other newly-established forms.  The flexibility of mind is a concomitant of the carnivorous habit where  creatures obtain their prey by the chase. Such an occupation tends to  develop agile minds as well as bodies, and where exercised as it  doubtless was by the ancestry of the dog, in the manner of pack hunting,  where many individuals share in the chase, it is well calculated to  insure a certain free and outgoing quality of the mind.    [Illustration: Dutch Dogs used in Harness]    So long as our dogs were employed in the labor or the organized  recreations of man, the tendency of the association with the superior  being was in a high measure educative. They were constantly submitted  to a more or less critical but always effective selection which  tended ever to develop a higher grade of intelligence. With the  advance in the organization of society the dog is losing something of  his utility, even in the way of sport. He is fast becoming a mere  idle favorite, prized for unimportant peculiarities of form. The  effort in the main is not now to make creatures which can help in the  employments of man, but to breed for show alone, demanding no more  intelligence than is necessary to make the animal a well-behaved  denizen of a house. The result is the institution of a wonderful  variety in the size, shape, and special peculiarities of different  breeds with what appears to be a concomitant loss in their  intelligence. We often hear it remarked by those who are familiar  with dogs that the ordinary mongrels are more intelligent and more  susceptible of high training than the carefully inbred varieties,  which are more highly prized because they conform to some thoroughly  artificial standard of form or coloring. This is what we should  expect from all we know concerning the breeding. Where for  generations the dog-fancier has selected for reproduction with  reference to the trifling and often injurious features of shape he  seeks to attain, he naturally and almost necessarily neglects to  choose the creatures in regard to their mental peculiarities. The  result is that the breed tends to fall back in these regards to below  the level of the ordinary cur, who makes his place in the affections  of his owner because he has attractive or useful qualities of mind.  It appears to me, in a word, that our treatment of this noble animal,  where he is bred for ornament, is in effect degrading.    Although the formation of our fancy breeds does not serve to advance the  development of those intellectual features which are the most  interesting part of our dogs, the experiments have served to show the  amazing physical plasticity of this species under the conditions of long  domestication. The range in size between a tiny spaniel, such as those  which are bred in Chihuahua, in northern Mexico, and the great Danes or  mastiffs of northern Europe, is, perhaps, the greatest which has ever  been attained in any mammal. In some cases the larger individuals  belonging to the mastiff breed probably weigh nearly thirty times as  much as their smaller kinsmen. Great as are these variations, they are  only in form and bulk. They involve none of those curious changes in the  number of bones of the skeleton which we may trace among the  domesticated pigeons. We therefore turn from these results of breeders'  fancy to consider certain of the mental qualities of dogs which have not  come in our way in our review of the history of its relations to man.    First of all, we may note the fact that the friendly relations which  dogs have become accustomed to form with men vary exceedingly in their  range and activity. Perhaps in no other regard does the dog exhibit  such distinctly human characteristics as in the way in which he meets  the individuals of the mastering species. The gamut of their social  relations with men is almost exactly parallel with our own. With from  one to a dozen persons a dog may maintain an attitude of almost equally  complete sympathy and mutual understanding. He may be on terms of  acquaintanceship in varied degrees of familiarity with a few score  others with whom he comes in frequent contact. Toward the rest of  mankind he maintains a position of more or less complete distrust,  which with experience may attain the indifference which men commonly  show toward perfect strangers. If we observe a dog going along a  much-frequented street, we may note that his relations to the people  are substantially those which the folk have to each other. He shows as  they do a certain consideration for the individuals he encounters,  gives them their due place, and yet holds to his own. It is  particularly noticeable that he avoids all contact with the other  passers--in fact a dog has to be much beside himself with rage or fear,  or insane from disease, before he will break those bounds of  personality which civilization has set up to guide the conduct of life.    [Illustration: King Charles Spaniel]    The social culture of dogs appears to have gone to the point where  they recognize the meaning of an introduction--at least as far as the  sympathetic relations of that understanding are concerned. Almost any  well-bred dog will submit to be presented by his master, or even by  persons whom he knows but is not accustomed to obey, to a stranger to  whom he has already exhibited some dislike. During the introduction  he will submit to those formal exchanges of courtesy which he is  accustomed to recognize as the indices of friendship. The impression  of this understanding seems to be so permanent that on subsequent  meetings the dog, though he may maintain his original dislike of the  man who has been forced upon his acquaintance, will continue to treat  him with a certain consideration, though it is often easy to see that  it is a difficult matter for him to conform to the requirements of  society. When we compare the conduct of dogs in these regards with  the behavior of other animals, even highly domesticated forms, we  perceive how marvellously successful has been man's unconscious  effort to mould this creature on his own nature.    Another extremely human characteristic of our canine friends is shown  in their susceptibility to ridicule. Faint traces of this quality are  to be"]]]
