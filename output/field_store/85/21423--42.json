With great sorrow she determined to sever her connection  with home and family and join her sister in Philadelphia. There the  exile from the South poured out her soul in an Appeal to the Christian  Women of the South. The manuscript was handed to the officers of the  Anti-slavery Society in the city and, as they read, tears filled  their eyes. The Appeal was immediately printed in large quantities for  distribution in Southern States.    Copies of the Appeal which had been sent to Charleston were seized by a  mob and publicly burned. When it became known soon afterwards that the  author of the offensive document was intending to return to Charleston  to spend the winter with her family, there was intense excitement, and  the mayor of the city informed the mother that her daughter would not be  permitted to land in Charleston nor to communicate with any one there,  and that, if she did elude the police and come ashore, she would be  imprisoned and guarded until the departure of the next boat. On account  of the distress which she would cause to her friends, Miss Grimke  reluctantly gave up the exercise of her constitutional right to visit  her native city and in a very literal sense she became a permanent  exile.    The two sisters let their light shine among Philadelphia Quakers. In  the religious meetings negro women were consigned to a special seat. The  Grimkes, having first protested against this discrimination, took their  own places on the seat with the colored women. In Charleston, Angelina  had scrupulously adhered to the Quaker garb because it was viewed as a  protest against slavery. In Philadelphia, however, no such meaning was  attached to the costume, and she adopted clothing suited to the climate  regardless of conventions. A series of parlor talks to women which had  been organized by the sisters grew in interest until the parlors became  inadequate, and the speakers were at last addressing large audiences of  women in the public meeting-places of Philadelphia.    At this time when Angelina was making effective use of her unrivaled  power as a public speaker, she received in 1836 an invitation from the  Anti-slavery Society of New York to address the women of that city. She  informed her sister that she believed this to be a call from God and  that it was her duty to accept. Sarah decided to be her companion and  assistant in the work in the new field, which was similar to that in  Philadelphia. Its fame soon extended to Boston, whence came an urgent  invitation to visit that city. It was in Massachusetts that men began to  steal into the women's meetings and listen from the back seats. In Lynn  all barriers were broken down, and a modest, refined, and naturally  diffident young woman found herself addressing immense audiences of men  and women. In the old theater in Boston for six nights in succession,  audiences filling all the space listened entranced to the messenger of  emancipation. There is uniform testimony that, in an age distinguished  for oratory, no more effective speaker appeared than Angelina Grimke.  It was she above all others who first vindicated the right of women to  speak to men from the public platform on political topics. But it must  be remembered that scores of other women were laboring to the same end  and were fully prepared to utilize the new opportunity.    The great world movement from slavery towards freedom, from despotism  to democracy, is characterized by a tendency towards the equality of  the sexes. Women have been slaves where men were free. In barbarous ages  women have been ignored or have been treated as mere adjuncts to the  ruling sex. But wherever there has been a distinct contribution to the  cause of liberty there has been a distinct recognition of woman's share  in the work. The Society of Friends was organized on the principle that  men and women are alike moral beings, hence are equal in the sight of  God. As a matter of experience, women were quite as often moved to break  the silence of a religious meeting as were the men.    For two hundred years women had been accustomed to talk to both men  and women in Friends' meetings and, when the moral war against slavery  brought religion and politics into close relation, they were ready  speakers upon both topics. When the Grimke sisters came into the church  with a fresh baptism of the Spirit, they overcame all obstacles and,  with a passion for righteousness, moral and spiritual and political,  they carried the war against slavery into politics.    In 1833, at the organization of the American Anti-Slavery Society  in Philadelphia, a number of women were present. Lucretia Mott, a  distinguished \"minister\" in the Society of Friends, took part in the  proceedings. She was careful to state that she spoke as a mere visitor,  having no place in the organization, but she ventured to suggest various  modifications in the report of Garrison's committee on a declaration of  principles which rendered it more acceptable to the meeting. It had not  then been seriously considered whether women could become members of  the Anti-Slavery Society, which was at that time composed exclusively  of men, with the women maintaining their separate organizations as  auxiliaries.    The women of the West were already better organized than the men and  were doing a work which men could not do. They were, for the most part,  unconscious of any conflict between the peculiar duties of men and  those of women in their relations to common objects. The \"library  associations\" of Indiana, which were in fact effective anti-slavery  societies, were to a large extent composed of women. To the library  were added numerous other disguises, such as \"reading circles,\" \"sewing  societies,\" \"women's clubs.\" In many communities the appearance of men  in any of these enterprises would create suspicion or even raise a mob.  But the women worked on quietly, effectively, and unnoticed.    The matron of a family would be provided with the best riding-horse  which the neighborhood could furnish. Mounted upon her steed, she would  sally forth in the morning, meet her carefully selected friends in  a town twenty miles away, gain information as to what had been  accomplished, give information as to the work in other parts of the  district, distribute new literature, confer as to the best means of  extending their labors, and return in the afternoon. The father of  such a family was quite content with the humbler task of cooperation by  supplying the sinews of war. There was complete equality between husband  and wife because their aims were identical and each rendered the service  most convenient and most needed. Women did what men could not do. In  the territory of the enemy the men were reached through the gradual and  tentative efforts of women whom the uninitiated supposed to be spending  idle hours at a sewing circle. Interest was maintained by the use of  information of the same general character as that which later took the  country by storm in Uncle Tom's Cabin. In course of time all disguise  was thrown aside. A public speaker of national reputation would appear,  a meeting would be announced, and a rousing abolition speech would be  delivered; the mere men of the neighborhood would have little conception  how the surprising change had been accomplished.    On rare occasions the public presentation of the anti-slavery view  would be undertaken prematurely, as in 1840 at Pendleton, Indiana, when  Frederick Douglass attempted to address a public meeting and was almost  slain by missiles from the mob. Pendleton, however, was not given over  to the enemy. The victim of the assault was restored to health in the  family of a leading citizen. The outrage was judiciously utilized  to convince the fair-minded that one of the evils of slavery was the  development of minds void of candor and justice. On the twenty-fifth  anniversary of the Pendleton disturbance there was another great meeting  in the town. Frederick Douglass was the hero of the occasion. The woman  who was the head of the family that restored him to health was on the  platform. Some of the men who threw the brickbats were there to make  public confession and to apologize for the brutal deed.    In the minds of a few persons of rare intellectual and logical  endowment, democracy has always implied the equality of the sexes. From  the time of the French Revolution there have been advocates of this  doctrine. As early as 1820, Frances Wright, a young woman in Scotland  having knowledge of the Western republic founded upon the professed  principles of liberty and equality, came to America for the express  purpose of pleading the cause of equal rights for women. To the  general public her doctrine seemed revolutionary, threatening the very  foundations of religion and morality. In the midst of opposition and  persecution she proclaimed views respecting the rights and duties of  women which today are generally accepted as axiomatic.    The women who attended the meetings for the organization of the American  Anti-Slavery Society were not suffragists, nor had they espoused any  special theories respecting the position of women. They did not wish to  be members of the men's organizations but were quite content with their  own separate one, which served its purpose very well under prevailing  local conditions. James G. Birney, the candidate of the Liberty party  for the Presidency in 1840, had good reasons for opposition to the  inclusion of men and women in the same organization. He knew that by  acting separately they were winning their way. The introduction of a  novel theory involving a different issue seemed to him likely to be a  source of weakness. The cause of women was, however, gaining ground  and winning converts. Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were  delegates to the World's Anti-Slavery Convention at London. They  listened to the debate which ended in the refusal to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30396"],[0,"Books and Authors (#6)"],[1,"Varina,  was a Miss Jane Waryng, to whom he wrote passionate letters, and whom,  when he had succeeded in gaining her affections, he deserted, after a  sort of seven years' courtship. The next flame of the Dean's was the  well-known Miss Esther Johnson, whom he fancifully called Stella.  Somehow, he had the address to gain her decided attachment to him,  though considerably younger, beautiful in person, accomplished, and  estimable. He dangled upon her, fed her hopes of an union, and at length  persuaded her to leave London and reside near him in Ireland. His  conduct then was of a piece with the rest of his life: he never saw  her alone, never slept under the same roof with her, but allowed her  character and reputation to be suspected, in consequence of their  intimacy; nor did he attempt to remove such by marriage until a late  period of his life, when, to save her from dissolution, he consented to  the ceremony, upon condition that it should never be divulged; that she  should live as before; retain her own name, &c.; and this wedding, upon  the above being assented to, was performed in a garden! But Swift never  acknowledged her till the day of his death. During all this treatment of  his Stella, Swift had ingratiated himself with a young lady of fortune  and fashion in London, whose name was Vanhomrig, and whom he called  Vanessa. It is much to be regretted that the heartless tormentor should  have been so ardently and passionately beloved, as was the case with the  latter lady. Selfish, hardhearted as was Swift, he seemed but to live in  disappointing others. Such was his coldness and brutality to Vanessa,  that he may be said to have caused her death.           *       *       *       *       *      COLERIDGE'S \"WATCHMAN.\"    Coleridge, among his many speculations, started a periodical, in prose  and verse, entitled _The Watchman_, with the motto, \"that all might know  the truth, and that the truth might make us free.\" He watched in vain!  Coleridge's incurable want of order and punctuality, and his philosophical  theories, tired out and disgusted his readers, and the work was  discontinued after the ninth number. Of the unsaleable nature of this  publication, he relates an amusing illustration. Happening one morning  to rise at an earlier hour than usual, he observed his servant-girl  putting an extravagant quantity of paper into the grate, in order to  light the fire, and he mildly checked her for her wastefulness: \"La!  sir,\" replied Nanny; \"why, it's only _Watchmen_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      IRELAND'S SHAKSPEARE FORGERIES.    Mr. Samuel Ireland, originally a silk merchant in Spitalfields, was  led by his taste for literary antiquities to abandon trade for those  pursuits, and published several tours. One of them consisted of an  excursion upon the river Avon, during which he explored, with ardent  curiosity, every locality associated with Shakspeare. He was accompanied  by his son, a youth of sixteen, who imbibed a portion of his father's  Shakspearean mania. The youth, perceiving the great importance which his  parent attached to every relic of the poet, and the eagerness with which  he sought for any of his MS. remains, conceived that it would not be  difficult to gratify his father by some productions of his own, in the  language and manner of Shakspeare's time. The idea possessed his mind  for a certain period; and, in 1793, being then in his eighteenth year,  he produced some MSS. said to be in the handwriting of Shakspeare, which  he said had been given him by a gentleman possessed of many other old  papers. The young man, being articled to a solicitor in Chancery, easily  fabricated, in the first instance, the deed of mortgage from Shakspeare  to Michael Fraser. The ecstasy expressed by his father urged him to the  fabrication of other documents, described to come from the same quarter.  Emboldened by success, he ventured upon higher compositions in prose and  verse; and at length announced the discovery of an original drama, under  the title of _Vortigern_, which he exhibited, act by act, written in  the period of two months. Having provided himself with the paper of the  period, (being the fly-leaves of old books,) and with ink prepared by a  bookbinder, no suspicion was entertained of the deception. The father,  who was a maniac upon such subjects, gave such _eclat_ to the supposed  discovery, that the attention of the literary world, and all England,  was drawn to it; insomuch that the son, who had announced other papers,  found it impossible to retreat, and was goaded into the production of  the series which he had promised.    The house of Mr. Ireland, in Norfolk-street, Strand, was daily crowded  to excess by persons of the highest rank, as well as by the most  celebrated men of letters. The MSS. being mostly decreed genuine, were  considered to be of inestimable worth; and at one time it was expected  that Parliament would give any required sum for them. Some conceited  amateurs in literature at length sounded an alarm, which was echoed by  certain of the newspapers and public journals; notwithstanding which,  Mr. Sheridan agreed to give 600_l_. for permission to play _Vortigern_  at Drury-lane Theatre. So crowded a house was scarcely ever seen as on  the night of the performance, and a vast number of persons could not  obtain admission. The predetermined malcontents began an opposition  from the outset: some ill-cast characters converted grave scenes into  ridicule, and there ensued between the believers and sceptics a contest  which endangered the property. The piece was, accordingly, withdrawn.    The juvenile author was now so beset for information, that he found it  necessary to abscond from his father's house; and then, to put an end  to the wonderful ferment which his ingenuity had created, he published  a pamphlet, wherein he confessed the entire fabrication. Besides  _Vortigern_, young Ireland also produced a play of Henry II.; and,  although there were in both such incongruities as were not consistent  with Shakspeare's age, both dramas contain passages of considerable  beauty and originality.    The admissions of the son did not, however, screen the father from  obloquy, and the reaction of public opinion affected his fortunes and  his health. Mr. Ireland was the dupe of his zeal upon such subjects; and  the son never contemplated at the outset the unfortunate effect. Such  was the enthusiasm of certain admirers of Shakspeare, (among them Drs.  Parr and Warton,) that they fell upon their knees before the MSS.; and,  by their idolatry, inspired hundreds of others with similar enthusiasm.  The young author was filled with astonishment and alarm, which at that  stage it was not in his power to check. Sir Richard Phillips, who knew  the parties, has thus related the affair in the _Anecdote Library_.    In the Catalogue of Dr. Parr's Library at Hatton, (_Bibliotheca  Parriana_,) we find the following attempted explanation by the Doctor:--    \"Ireland's (Samuel) 'Great and impudent forgery, called,' Miscellaneous  Papers and Legal Instruments, under the hand and seal of William  Shakspeare, folio 1796.    \"I am almost ashamed to insert this worthless and infamously trickish  book. It is said to include the tragedy of _King Lear_, and a fragment  of _Hamlet_. Ireland told a lie when he imputed to _me_ the words which  _Joseph Warton_ used, the very morning I called on Ireland, and was  inclined to admit the possibility of genuineness in his papers. In my  subsequent conversation, I told him my change of opinion. But I thought  it not worth while to dispute in print with a detected impostor.--S. P.\"    Mr. Ireland died about 1802. His son, William Henry, long survived him;  but the forgeries blighted his literary reputation for ever, and he  died in straitened circumstances, about the year 1840. The reputed  Shakspearean MSS. are stated to have been seen for sale in a pawnbroker's  window in Wardour-street, Soho.           *       *       *       *       *      HOOLE, THE TRANSLATOR OF TASSO. THE GHOST PUZZLED.    Hoole was born in a hackney-coach, which was conveying his mother to  Drury-lane Theatre, to witness the performance of the tragedy of  _Timanthes_, which had been written by her husband. Hoole died in 1839,  at a very advanced age. In early life, he ranked amongst the literary  characters that adorned the last century; and, for some years before his  death, had outlived most of the persons who frequented the _conversazioni_  of Dr. Johnson. By the will of the Doctor, Mr. Hoole was enabled to take  from his library and effects such books and furniture as he might think  proper to select, by way of memorial of that great personage. He  accordingly chose a chair in which Dr. Johnson usually sat, and the  desk upon which he had written the greater number of the papers of the  _Rambler_; both these articles Mr. Hoole used constantly until nearly  the day of his death.    Hoole was near-sighted. He was partial to the drama; and, when young,  often strutted his hour at an amateur theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields.  Upon one occasion, whilst performing the ghost in _Hamlet_, Mr. Hoole  wandered incautiously from off the trap-door through which he had  emerged from the nether world, and by which it was his duty to descend.  In this dilemma he groped about, hoping to distinguish the aperture,  keeping the audience in wonder why he remained so long on the stage  after the crowing of the cock. It was apparent from the lips of the  ghost that he was holding converse with some one at the wings. He at  length became irritated, and \"alas! poor ghost!\" ejaculated, in tones  sufficiently audible, \"I tell you I can't find it.\" The laughter that  ensued may be imagined. The ghost, had he been a sensible one, would  have walked off; but no--he became more and more irritated, until  the perturbed spirit was placed, by some of the bystanders, on the  trap-door,"]]]
