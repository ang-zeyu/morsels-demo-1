The state had recognized the importance of the  new device and cuirassiers in glittering breastplates on horseback,  and halbardiers in buff leather on foot guarded it in its transit  through the sleeping city. But Paris was not all asleep. An escort  of the sensation-loving rabble kept pace with the guards. The cries  of the quarters rose above the tramp of the armed men. Observers  have recorded that the passing cab drivers were so affected by  wonder that they clambered down from their boxes and with doffed  hats knelt in the highway while the procession passed.    The ascension, which occurred two days later, was another moving  spectacle. In the centre of the great square which has seen so many  historic pageants, rose the swaying, quivering balloon, now filled  to its full capacity of twenty-two thousand feet. Whether from the  art instinct indigenous to the French, or some superstitious idea  like that which impels the Chinese to paint eyes on their junks, the  balloon was lavishly decorated in water colours, with views of  rising suns, whirling planets, and other solar bodies amongst which  it was expected to mingle.    Ranks of soldiers kept the populace at a distance, while within the  sacred precincts strolled the King and the ladies and cavaliers of  his court treading all unconsciously on the brink of that red terror  soon to engulf the monarchy. The gas in the reeling bag was no more  inflammable than the air of Paris in those days just before the  Revolution. With a salvo of cannon the guy-ropes were released and  the balloon vanished in the clouds.    Benjamin Franklin, at the moment representing in France the American  colonies then struggling for liberty, witnessed this ascension! \"Of  what use is a new-born child?\" he remarked sententiously as the  balloon vanished. 'Twas a saying worthy of a cautious philosopher.  Had Franklin been in Paris in 1914 he would have found the child,  grown to lusty manhood, a strong factor in the city's defence. It is  worth noting by the way that so alert was the American mind at that  period that when the news of the Montgolfiers' achievement reached  Philadelphia it found David Rittenhouse and other members of the  Philosophical Society already experimenting with balloons.    [Illustration: _A Rescue at Sea._    _From the painting by Lieutenant Farre._    Photo by Peter A. Juley.]    A curious sequel attended the descent of the Montgolfier craft which  took place in a field fifteen miles from Paris. Long before the days  of newspapers, the peasants had never heard of balloons, and this  mysterious object, dropping from high heaven into their peaceful  carrot patch affrighted them. Some fled. Others approached timidly,  armed with the normal bucolic weapons--scythes and pitchforks.  Attacked with these the fainting monster, which many took for a  dragon, responded with loud hisses and emitted a gas of unfamiliar  but most pestiferous odour. It suggested brimstone, which to the  devout in turn implied the presence of Satan. With guns, flails, and  all obtainable weapons they fell upon the emissary of the Evil One,  beat him to the ground, crushed out of him the vile-smelling breath  of his nostrils, and finally hitched horses to him and dragged him  about the fields until torn to tatters and shreds.    When the public-spirited M. Charles who had contributed largely to  the cost of this experiment came in a day or two to seek his balloon  he found nothing but some shreds of cloth, and some lively legends  of the prowess of the peasants in demolishing the devil's own  dragon.    The government, far-sightedly, recognizing that there would be more  balloons and useful ones, thereupon issued this proclamation for the  discouragement of such bucolic valour:         A discovery has been made which the government deems it wise to       make known so that alarm may not be occasioned to the people. On       calculating the different weights of inflammable and common air       it has been found that a balloon filled with inflammable air will       rise toward heaven until it is in equilibrium with the       surrounding air; which may not happen till it has attained to a       great height. Anyone who should see such a globe,       resembling the moon in an eclipse, should be aware that far from       being an alarming phenomenon it is only a machine made of       taffetas, or light canvas covered with paper, that cannot       possibly cause any harm and which will some day prove serviceable       to the wants of society.    Came now the next great step in the progress of aeronautics. It had  been demonstrated that balloons could lift themselves. They had even  been made to lift dumb animals and restore them to earth unhurt. But  if the conquest of the air was to amount to anything, men must go  aloft in these new machines. Lives must be risked to demonstrate a  theory, or to justify a calculation. Aeronautics is no science for  laboratory or library prosecution. Its battles must be fought in the  sky, and its devotees must be willing to offer their lives to the  cause. In that respect the science of aviation has been different  from almost any subject of inquiry that has ever engaged the  restless intellect of man, unless perhaps submarine navigation, or  the invention of explosives. It cannot be prosecuted except with a  perfect willingness to risk life. No doubt this is one of the  reasons why practical results seemed so long in the coming. Nor have  men been niggardly in this enforced sacrifice. Though no records of  assured accuracy are available, the names of forty-eight aeronauts  who gave up their lives in the century following the Montgolfiers'  invention are recorded. That record ended in 1890. How many have  since perished, particularly on the battlefields of Europe where  aircraft are as commonplace as cannon, it is too early yet to  estimate.    [Illustration: Montgolfier's Passenger Balloon.]    After the success of the ascension from the _Champ de Mars_, the  demand at once arose for an ascension by a human being. It was a  case of calling for volunteers. The experiments already made showed  clearly enough that the balloon would rise high in air. Who would  risk his life soaring one thousand feet or more above the earth, in  a flimsy bag, filled with hot air, or inflammable gas, without means  of directing its course or bringing it with certainty and safety  back to a landing place? It was a hard question, and it is  interesting to note that it was answered not by a soldier or sailor,  not by an adventurer, or devil-may-care spirit, but by a grave and  learned professor of physical science, Pilatre de Rozier. Presently  he was joined in his enterprise by a young man of the fashionable  world and sporting tastes, the Marquis d'Arlandes. Aristocratic  Paris took up aviation in the last days of the eighteenth century,  precisely as the American leisure class is taking it up in the first  days of the twentieth.    The balloon for this adventure was bigger than its predecessors and  for the first time a departure was taken from the spherical  variety--the gas bag being seventy-four feet high, and forty-eight  feet in diameter. Like the first Montgolfier balloons it was to be  inflated with hot air, and the car was well packed with bundles of  fuel with which the two aeronauts were to fill the iron brazier when  its fires went down. The instinct for art and decoration, so strong  in the French mind, had been given full play by the constructors of  this balloon and it was painted with something of the gorgeousness  of a circus poster.    A tremendous crowd packed the park near Paris whence the ascent was  made. Always the spectacle of human lives in danger has a morbid  attraction for curiosity seekers, and we have seen in our own days  throngs attracted to aviation congresses quite as much in the  expectation of witnessing some fatal disaster, as to observe the  progress made in man's latest conquest over nature. But in this  instance the occasion justified the widest interest. It was an  historic moment--more epoch-making than those who gathered in that  field in the environs of Paris could have possibly imagined. For in  the clumsy, gaudy bag, rolling and tossing above a smoky fire lay  the fundamentals of those great airships that, perfected by the  persistence of Count Zeppelin, have crossed angry seas, breasted  fierce winds, defied alike the blackest nights and the thickest fogs  to rain their messages of death on the capital of a foe.    Contemporary accounts of this first ascension are but few, and those  that have survived have come down to us in but fragmentary form. It  was thought needful for two to make the ascent, for the car, or  basket, which held the fire hung below the open mouth of the bag,  and the weight of a man on one side would disturb the perfect  equilibrium which it was believed would be essential to a successful  flight. The Marquis d'Arlandes in a published account of the brief  flight, which sounds rather as if the two explorers of an unknown  element were not free from nervousness, writes:    \"Our departure was at fifty-four minutes past one, and occasioned  little stir among the spectators. Thinking they might be frightened  and stand in need of encouragement I waved my arm.\"    This solicitude for the fears of the spectators, standing safely on  solid earth while the first aeronauts sailed skywards, is  characteristically Gallic. The Marquis continues:         M. de Rozier cried: \"You are doing nothing, and we are not       rising.\" I stirred the fire and then began to scan the river,       but Pilatre again cried: \"See the river. We are dropping into       it!\" We again urged the fire, but still clung to the river bed.       Presently I heard a noise in the upper part "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#6)"],[1,"that quite a  crowd of boys, as well as men, had collected, though it was early in  the morning. Somehow, news of the test had leaked out.    The ship continued to get lighter and lighter as more gas was  generated. It was held down by ropes, fastened to stakes driven in the  ground. Mr. Sharp entered the big car that was suspended, below the  aeroplanes.    \"Come on, Tom,\" the aeronaut called. \"We're almost ready to fly. Will  you come too, Mr. Swift, and Garret?\"    \"Some other time,\" promised the aged inventor. \"It looks as though you  were going to succeed, though. I'll wait, however, until after the test  before I venture.\"    \"How about you, Garret?\" asked Tom of the engineer, as the young  inventor climbed into the car.    \"The ground is good enough for me,\" was the answer, with a smile.  \"Broken bones don't mend so easily when you're past sixty-five.\"    \"But we're not going to fall!\" declared Mr. Sharp. \"All ready, Tom.  Cast off! Here we go!\"    The restraining ropes were quickly cast aside. Slowly at first, and  then with a rush, as though feeling more and more sure of herself, the  Red Cloud arose in the air like a gigantic bird of scarlet plumage. Up  and up it went, higher than the house, higher than the big shed where  it had been built, higher, higher, higher!    \"There she is!\" cried the shrill voices of the boys in the meadow, and  the hoarser tones of the men mingled with them.    \"Hurrah!\" called Tom softly to the balloonist. \"We're off!\" and he  waved his hand to his father and Garret.    \"I told you so,\" spoke Mr. Sharp confidently. \"I'm going to start the  propellers in a minute.\"    \"Oh, dear me, goodness sakes alive!\" cried Mrs. Baggert, the  housekeeper, running from the house and wringing her hands. \"I'm sure  they'll fall!\"    She looked up apprehensively, but Tom only waved his hand to her, and  threw her a kiss. Clearly he had no fears, though it was the first time  he had ever been in an airship. Mr. Sharp was as calm and collected as  an ocean captain making his hundredth trip across the Atlantic.    \"Throw on the main switch,\" he called to our hero, and Tom, moving to  amidships in the car, did as directed. Mr. Sharp pulled several levers,  adjusted some valves, and then, with a rattle and bang, the huge,  twenty-cylinder motor started.    Waiting a moment to see that it was running smoothly, Mr. Sharp grasped  the steering wheel. Then, with a quick motion he threw the two  propellers in gear. They began to whirl around rapidly.    \"Here we go!\" cried Tom, and, sure enough, the Red Cloud, now five  hundred feet in the air, shot forward, like a boat on the water, only  with such a smooth, gliding, easy motion, that it seemed like being  borne along on a cloud.    \"She works! She works!\" cried the balloonist. \"Now to try our elevation  rudder,\" and, as the Red Cloud gathered speed, he tilted the small  planes which sent the craft up or down, according to the manner in  which they were tilted. The next instant the airship was pointed at an  angle toward the clouds, and shooting along at swift speed, while, from  below came the admiring cheers of the crowd of boys and men.          Chapter 5    Colliding With A Tower      \"She seems to work,\" observed Tom, looking from where he was stationed  near some electrical switches, toward Mr. Sharp.    \"Of course she does,\" replied the aeronaut. \"I knew it would, but I  wasn't so sure that it would scoot along in this fashion. We're making  pretty good speed, but we'll do better when the motor gets to running  smoother.\"    \"How high up are we?\" asked Tom.    The balloonist glanced at several gauges near the steering wheel.    \"A little short of three thousand feet,\" he answered. \"Do you want to  go higher?\"    \"No--no--I--I guess not,\" was Tom's answer. He halted over the works,  and his breath came in gasps.    \"Don't get alarmed,\" called Mr. Sharp quickly, noting that his  companion was in distress because of the high altitude. \"That always  happens to persons who go into a thin air for the first time; just as  if you had climbed a high mountain. Breathe as slowly as you can, and  swallow frequently. That will relieve the pressure on your ear drums.  I'll send the ship lower.\"    Tom did as he was advised, and the aeronaut, deflecting the rudder,  sent the Red Cloud on a downward slant. Tom at once felt relieved, both  because the action of swallowing equalized the pressure on the ear  drums, and because the airship was soon in a more dense atmosphere,  more like that of the earth.    \"How are you now?\" asked the man of the lad, as the craft was again on  an even keel.    \"All right,\" replied Tom, briskly. \"I didn't know what ailed me at  first.\"    \"I was troubled the same way when I first went up in a balloon,\"  commented Mr. Sharp. \"We'll run along for a few miles, at an elevation  of about five hundred feet, and then we'll go to within a hundred feet  of the earth, and see how the Red Cloud behaves under different  conditions. Take a look below and see what you think of it.\"    Tom looked low, through one of several plate glass windows in the floor  of the car. He gave a gasp of astonishment.    \"Why! We're right over Lake Carlopa!\" he gasped.    \"Of course,\" admitted Mr. Sharp with a laugh. \"And I'm glad to say that  we're better off than when I was last in the air over this same body of  water,\" and he could scarcely repress a shudder as he thought of his  perilous position in the blazing balloon, as related in detail in \"Tom  Swift and His Motor-Boat.\"    The lake was spread out below the navigators of the air like some  mirror of silver in a setting of green fields. Tom could see a winding  river, that flowed into the lake, and he noted towns, villages, and  even distant cities, interspersed here and there with broad farms or  patches of woodlands, like a bird's-eye view of a stretch of country.    \"This is great!\" he exclaimed, with enthusiasm. \"I wouldn't miss this  for the world!\"    \"Oh, you haven't begun to see things yet,\" replied Mr. Sharp. \"Wait  until we take a long trip, which we'll do soon, as this ship is  behaving much better than I dared to hope. Well, we're five hundred  feet high now, and I'll run along at that elevation for a while.\"    Objects on the earth became more distinct now, and Tom could observe  excited throngs running along and pointing upward. They were several  miles from Shopton, and the machinery was running smoothly; the motor,  with its many cylinders purring like a big cat.    \"We could have lunch, if we'd brought along anything to eat,\" observed  Tom.    \"Yes,\" assented his companion. \"But I think we'll go back now. Your  father may be anxious. Just come here, Tom, and I'll show you how to  steer. I'm going down a short distance.\"    He depressed the rudder, and the Red Cloud shot earthward. Then, as the  airship was turned about, the young inventor was allowed to try his  hand at managing it. He said, afterward, that it was like guiding a  fleecy cloud.    \"Point her straight for Shopton,\" counseled Mr. Sharp, when he had  explained the various wheels and levers to the lad.    \"Straight she is,\" answered the lad, imitating a sailor's reply. \"Oh,  but this is great! It beats even my motor-boat!\"    \"It goes considerably faster, at all events,\" remarked Mr. Sharp.  \"Keep her steady now, while I take a look at the engine. I want to be  sure it doesn't run hot.\"    He went aft, where all the machinery in the car was located, and Tom  was left alone in the small pilot house. He felt a thrill as he looked  down at the earth beneath him, and saw the crowds of wonder-gazers  pointing at the great, red airship flying high over their heads.  Rapidly the open fields slipped along, giving place to a large city.    \"Rocksmond,\" murmured Tom, as he noted it. \"We're about fifty miles  from home, but we'll soon be back in the shed at this rate. We  certainly are slipping along. A hundred and fifty feet elevation,\" he  went on, as he looked at a gauge. \"I wonder if I'll ever get used to  going several miles up in the air?\"    He shifted the rudder a bit, to go to the left. The Red Cloud obeyed  promptly, but, the next instant something snapped. Tom, with a startled  air, looked around. He could see nothing wrong, but a moment later, the  airship dipped suddenly toward the earth. Then it seemed to increase  its forward speed, and, a few seconds later, was rushing straight at a  tall, ornamental tower that rose from one corner of a large building.    \"Mr. Sharp! Mr. Sharp!\" cried the lad. \"Something has happened! We're  heading for that tower!\"    \"Steer to one side!\" called the balloonist.    Tom tried, but found that the helm had become jammed. The horizontal  rudder would not work, and the craft was rushing nearer and nearer,  every minute, to the pile of brick and mortar.    \"We're going to have a collision!\" shouted Tom. \"Better shut off the  power!\"    The two propellers were whirling around so swiftly that they looked  like blurs of light. Mr. Sharp came rushing forward, and Tom  relinquished the steering wheel to him. In vain did the aeronaut try to  change the course of the airship. Then, with a shout to Tom to  disconnect the electric switch, the man turned off the power from the  motor.    But it was too late. Straight at the tower rushed the Red Cloud, and, a  moment later had hit it a glancing blow, smashing the forward  propeller, and breaking off both blades. The nose of the aluminum gas  container knocked off a few bricks from the tower, and then, the ship  losing way, slowly settled to the flat roof of the building.    \"We're smashed!\" cried Tom, with something like despair in his voice.    \"That's nothing! Don't worry! It might be worse! Not the first time  I've had an accident. It's only one propeller, and I can easily make  another,\" said Mr. Sharp, in his quick, jerky sentences. He had allowed  some of the gas to escape from the container, making the ship less  buoyant, so that it"]]]
