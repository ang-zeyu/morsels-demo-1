The habits of the animal render it impossible to  prevent infection of the external opening at the end of the teat and  there is no mechanical reason why bacteria cannot readily find their way  along the moist lining membrane for some distance. If organisms are  adapted to this kind of an environment, ideal conditions exist for their  multiplication, as moisture, warmth and suitable food supply are  present. The question arises how far up into this organ is penetration  possible? Within late years numerous observations have been made on the  presence of organisms in the upper portion of the udder in contact with  the secreting tissue.[8]    These investigations prove that bacteria are distributed throughout the  whole of the udder, although numerically they are much less abundant in  the region of the milk-secreting tissue than in the lower portion.  Ward's conclusions are \"that milk when secreted by the glands of a  healthy udder is sterile. It may however, immediately become  contaminated by the bacteria which are normally present in the smaller  milk ducts of the udder.\"    ~Nature of bacteria in fore milk.~ Generally speaking the number of  different species found in the fore milk is not large, and of those  which do appear many occur at only occasional intervals. Moore[9] in the  examination of 9 udders found 20 different forms, and of these only 3  species predominated, all of which proved to be micrococci. Streptococci  have also been quite frequently reported. Freudenreich[10] found the  most common types to be cocci, belonging to both the liquefying and  non-liquefying class.    Peptonizing[11] and spore-bearing[12] species have also been reported as  well as gas-producing[13] forms allied to the colon bacillus. Such  findings are, however, due in all probability to accidental invasion.  Most investigators report the absence of the distinctively lactic-acid  group of organisms.[14]    ~Origin of bacteria in udder.~ There is no question but that many of the  types of bacteria found in the udder gain access from the outside. Those  belonging to the spore-bearing, digesting and intestinal types have such  a favorable opportunity for introduction from outside and are so  unlikely to have come directly from the body of the animal, that the  external source of infection is much more probable. Whether this  explanation answers the origin of the cocci that are so generally found  in the upper portion of the udder is questionable. The statement is  ordinarily made that the inner tissues of healthy organs are  bacteria-free, but the studies of Ford[15] seem to indicate that 70 per  cent. of such organs, removed under aseptic conditions from guinea pigs,  rabbits, dogs and cats contained living organisms. Others have reported  similar results in which cocci have been found[16] very similar to those  occurring in the udder. These findings increase the probability that the  origin of this type is from the blood. The persistence of certain  species in the udder for months as noted by Ward indicates possibility  of growth of some forms at least. Stocking[17] has shown where cows are  not milked clean that the germ content of succeeding milkings is greatly  increased.    ~Artificial introduction of bacteria into udder.~ If bacteria are capable  of actually developing in the udder proper, it ought to be possible to  easily demonstrate this by the artificial introduction of cultures. In a  number of cases[18] such experiments have been made with various  saprophytic forms, such as _B. prodigiosus_, lactic acid bacilli and  others. In no case has it appeared evident that actual growth has  occurred, although the introduced organism has been demonstrated in  diminishing numbers for 5-6 days. Even the common lactic acid germ and a  yellow liquefying coccus isolated from the fore milk failed to persist  for more than a few days when thus artificially introduced. This failure  to colonize is indeed curious and needs explanation. Is it due to  unsuitable environmental conditions or attributable to the germicidal  influence of the milk?    Various body fluids are known to possess the property of destroying  bacteria and it is claimed by Fokker[19] that this same property was  found in freshly drawn milk. This peculiarity has also been investigated  by Freudenreich,[20] and Hunziker[21] who find a similar property.    No material increase in germ content takes place in milk for several  hours when chilled to 40 deg.-70 deg. F.; on the other hand an actual,  but usually not a marked decrease is observed for about 6 hours. This  phenomenon varies with the milk of different cows. Nothing is known as  to the cause of this apparent germicidal action. The question is yet by  no means satisfactorily settled, although the facts on which the  hypothesis is based are not in controversy. If such a peculiarity  belongs to milk, it is not at all improbable that it may serve to keep  down the germ content in the udder. Freudenreich[22] found that udders  which were not examined for some time after death showed abundant  growth, which fact he attributed to the loss of this germicidal  property.    The infection of the whole milk can be materially reduced by rejecting  the fore milk, but it is questionable whether such rejection is worth  while, except in the case of \"sanitary\" dairies where milk is produced  with as low a germ content as possible. The intrinsic loss in butter fat  in the fore milk is inconsiderable as the first few streams contain only  about one-fifth the normal fat content.    ~Infection of milk after withdrawal from animal.~ The germ content of the  milk, when it is being drawn from the animal is immediately increased  upon contact with the atmosphere. These organisms are derived from the  surrounding air and the utensils in which the milk is received and  stored. The number of organisms which find their way into the milk  depends largely upon the character of the surroundings. Bacteria are so  intimately associated with dirt, dust and filth of all kinds that  wherever the latter are found, the former are sure to be present in  abundance.    The most important factors in the infection of the milk after withdrawal  are the pollution which is directly traceable to the animal herself and  the condition of the milk utensils. Fortunately both of these sources of  contamination are capable of being greatly minimized by more careful  methods of handling.    ~Infection directly from the cow.~ It is a popular belief that the  organisms found in milk are derived from the feed and water which the  cow consumes, the same passing directly from the intestinal tract to the  milk by the way of the blood circulation. Such a view has no foundation  in fact as bacteria absorbed into the circulation are practically all  destroyed in the tissues by the action of the body fluids and cells.[23]  While organisms cannot pass readily from the intestine to the udder, yet  this must not be interpreted as indicating that no attention should be  given to the bacterial character of the material consumed. The water  supply given should be pure and wholesome and no decomposed or spoiled  food should be used.    The infection traceable directly to the cow is modified materially by  the conditions under which the animal is kept and the character of the  feed consumed. The nature of the fecal matter is in part dependent upon  the character of the food. The more nitrogenous rations with which  animals are now fed leads to the production of softer fecal discharges  which is more likely to soil the coat of the animal unless care is  taken. The same is true with animals kept on pasture in comparison with  those fed dry fodder.    Stall-fed animals, however, are more likely to have their flanks fouled,  unless special attention is paid to the removal of the manure. All dairy  stalls should be provided with a manure drop which should be cleaned as  frequently as circumstances will permit.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. Showing the bacterial contamination arising from  hair. These hairs were allowed to fall on a sterile gelatin surface. The  adherent bacteria developed readily in this medium, and the number of  bacteria thus introduced into the milk from these hairs can be estimated  by the number of developing colonies.]    The animal herself contributes materially to the quota of germ life  finding its way into the milk through the dislodgment of dust and filth  particles adhering to its hairy coat. The nature of this coat is such as  to favor the retention of these particles. Unless care is taken the  flanks and udder become polluted with fecal matter, which upon drying is  displaced with every movement of the animal. Every hair or dirt particle  so dislodged and finding its way into the milk-pail adds its quota of  organisms to the liquid. This can be readily demonstrated by placing  cow's hairs collected with care on the moist surface of gelatin culture  plates. Almost invariably, bacteria will be found in considerable  numbers adhering to such hairs as is indicated in Fig. 9. Dirt particles  are even richer in germ life. Not only is there the dislodgment of  hairs, epithelial scales and masses of dirt and filth, but during the  milking process, as at all other times, every motion of the animal is  accompanied by a shower of _invisible_ particles more or less teeming  with bacterial life.    The amount of actual impurities found in milk is often considerable and  when it is remembered that about one-half of fresh manure dissolves in  milk,[24] and thus does not appear as sediment, the presence of this  undissolved residue bespeaks filthy conditions as to milking. From  actual tests made, it is computed that the city of Berlin, Germany  consumes about 300 pounds of such dirt and filth daily.

A pleasant chapter might be  written on the suburban seats of our great lawyers from the Restoration  down to the present time. Lord Mansfield's 'Kenwood' is dear to all who  are curious in legal _ana_. Charles Yorke had a villa at Highgate, where  he entertained his political and personal friends. Holland, the  architect, built a villa at Dulwich for Lord Thurlow; and in consequence  of a quarrel between the Chancellor and the builder, the former took  such a dislike to the house, that after its completion he never slept a  night in it, though he often passed his holidays in a small lodge  standing in the grounds of the villa. \"Lord Thurlow,\" asked a lady of  him, as he was leaving the Queen's Drawing-room, \"when are you going  into your new house?\" \"Madam,\" answered the surly Chancellor, incensed  by her curiosity, \"the Queen has asked me that impudent question, and I  would not answer her; I will not tell you.\" For years Loughborough and  Erskine had houses in Hampstead. \"In Lord Mansfield's time,\" Erskine  once said to Lord Campbell, \"although the King's Bench monopolized all  the common-law business, the court often rose at one or two o'clock--the  papers, special, crown, and peremptory, being cleared; and then I  refreshed myself by a drive to my villa at Hampstead.\" It was on  Hampstead Heath that Loughborough, meeting Erskine in the dusk, said,  \"Erskine, you must not take Paine's brief;\" and received the prompt  reply, \"But I have been retained, and I will take it, by G-d!\" Much of  that which is most pleasant in Erskine's career occurred at his  Hampstead villa. Of Lord Kenyon's weekly trips from his mansion in  Lincoln's Inn Fields to his farm-house at Richmond notice has been taken  in a previous chapter. The memory of Charles Abbott's Hendon villa is  preserved in the name, style, and title of Lord Tenterden, of Hendon, in  the county of Middlesex. Indeed, lawyers have for many generations  manifested much fondness for fresh air; the impure atmosphere of their  courts in past time apparently whetting their appetites for wholesome  breezes.    Throughout the eighteenth century Lincoln's Inn Fields, an open though  disorderly spot, was a great place for the residence of legal magnates.  Somers, Nathan Wright, Cowper, Harcourt, successively inhabited Powis  House. Chief Justice Parker (subsequently Lord Chancellor Macclesfield)  lived there when he engaged Philip Yorke (then an attorney's articled  clerk, but afterwards Lord Chancellor of England) to be his son's law  tutor. On the south side of the square, Lord Chancellor Henley kept high  state in the family mansion that descended to him on the death of his  elder brother, and subsequently passed into the hands of the Surgeons,  whose modest but convenient college stands upon its site. Wedderburn and  Erskine had their mansions in Lincoln's Inn Fields, as well as their  suburban villas. And between the lawyers of the Restoration and the  judges of George III.'s reign, a large proportion of our most eminent  jurists and advocates lived in that square and the adjoining streets;  such as Queen Street on the west, Serle Street, Carey Street, Portugal  Street, Chancery Lane, on the south and south-east. The reader, let it  be observed, may not infer that this quarter was confined to legal  residents. The lawyers were the most conspicuous and influential  occupants; but they had for neighbors people of higher quality, who,  attracted to the square by its openness, or the convenience of its site,  or the proximity of the law colleges, made it their place of abode in  London. Such names as those of the Earl of Lindsey and the Earl of  Sandwich in the seventeenth, and of the Duke of Ancaster and the Duke of  Newcastle in the eighteenth century, establish the patrician character  of the quarter for many years. Moreover, from the books of popular  antiquaries, a long list might be made of wits, men of science, and  minor celebrities, who, though in no way personally connected with the  law, lived during the same period under the shadow of Lincoln's Inn.    Whilst Lincoln's Inn Fields took rank amongst the most aristocratic  quarters of the town, it was as disorderly a square as could be found in  all London. Royal suggestions, the labors of a learned committee  especially appointed by James I. to decide on a proper system of  architecture, and Inigo Jones's magnificent but abortive scheme had but  a poor result. In Queen Anne's reign, and for twenty years later, the  open space of the fields was daily crowded with beggars, mountebanks,  and noisy rabble; and it was the scene of constant uproar and frequent  riots. As soon as a nobleman's coach drew up before one of the  surrounding mansions, a mob of half-naked rascals swarmed about the  equipage, asking for alms in alternate tones of entreaty and menace.  Pugilistic encounters, and fights resembling the faction fights of an  Irish row, were of daily occurrence there; and when the rabble decided  on torturing a bull with dogs, the wretched beast was tied to a stake in  the centre of the wide area, and there baited in the presence of a  ferocious multitude, and to the diversion of fashionable ladies, who  watched the scene from their drawing-room windows. The Sacheverell  outrage was wildest in this chosen quarter of noblemen and blackguards;  and in George II.'s reign, when Sir Joseph Jekyll, the Master of the  Rolls, made himself odious to the lowest class by his Act for laying an  excise upon gin, a mob assailed him in the middle of the fields, threw  him to the ground, kicked him over and over, and savagely trampled upon  him. It was a marvel that he escaped with his life; but with  characteristic good humor, he soon made a joke of his ill-usage, saying  that until the mob made him their football he had never been master of  _all_ the _rolls_. Soon after this outbreak of popular violence, the  inhabitants enclosed the middle of the area with palisades, and turned  the enclosure into an ornamental garden. Describing the Fields in 1736,  the year in which the obnoxious Act concerning gin became law, James  Ralph says, \"Several of the original houses still remain, to be a  reproach to the rest; and I wish the disadvantageous comparison had  been a warning to others to have avoided a like mistake.... But this is  not the only quarrel I have to Lincoln's Inn Fields. The area is capable  of the highest improvement, might be made a credit to the whole city,  and do honor to those who live round it; whereas at present no place can  be more contemptible or forbidding; in short, it serves only as a  nursery for beggars and thieves, and is a daily reflection on those who  suffer it to be in its abandoned condition.\"    During the eighteenth century, a tendency to establish themselves in the  western portion of the town was discernible amongst the great law lords.  For instance, Lord Cowper, who during his tenure of the seals resided in  Powis House, during his latter years occupied a mansion in Great George  Street, Westminster--once a most fashionable locality, but now a street  almost entirely given up to civil engineers, who have offices there, but  usually live elsewhere. In like manner, Lord Harcourt, moving westwards  from Lincoln's Inn Fields, established himself in Cavendish Square. Lord  Henley, on retiring from the family mansion in Lincoln's Inn Fields,  settled in Grosvenor Square. Lord Camden lived in Hill Street, Berkeley  Square. On being entrusted with the sole custody of the seals, Lord  Apsley (better known as Lord Chancellor Bathurst) made his first  state-progress to Westminster Hall from his house in Dean Street, Soho;  but afterwards moving farther west, he built Apsley House (familiar to  every Englishman as the late Duke of Wellington's town mansion) upon the  site of Squire Western's favorite inn--the 'Hercules' Pillars.'          CHAPTER V.    THE OLD LAW QUARTER.      Fifteen years since the writer of this page used to dine with a  conveyancer--a lawyer of an old and almost obsolete school--who had a  numerous household, and kept a hospitable table in Lincoln's Inn Fields;  but the conveyancer was almost the last of his species. The householding  legal _resident_ of the Fields, like the domestic resident of the  Temple, has become a feature of the past. Among the ordinary nocturnal  population of the square called Lincoln's Inn Fields, may be found a few  solicitors who sleep by night where they work by day, and a sprinkling  of young barristers and law students who have residential chambers in  grand houses that less than a century since were tenanted by members of  a proud and splendid aristocracy; but the gentle families have by this  time altogether disappeared from the mansions.    But long before this aristocratic secession, the lawyers took possession  of a new quarter. The great charm of Lincoln's Inn Fields had been the  freshness of the air which played over the open space. So also the  recommendation of Great Queen Street had been the purity of its rural  atmosphere. Built between 1630 and 1730, that thoroughfare--at present  hemmed in by fetid courts and narrow passages--caught the keen breezes  of Hampstead, and long maintained a character for salubrity as well as  fashion. Of those fine squares and imposing streets which lie between  High Holborn and Hampstead, not a stone had been laid when the ground  covered by the present Freemason's Tavern was one of the most desirable  sites of the metropolis. Indeed, the houses between Holborn and Great  Queen Street were not erected till the mansions on the south side of  the latter thoroughfare--built long before the northern side--had for  years commanded an "]]]
