In reference to Mather's belief in the power of prayer, he expresses  himself with a bald simplicity, never equalled even by that Divine.  After stating that the Almighty Sovereign was his Father, and had  promised to hear and answer his petitions, he goes on to say: \"He had  often tested this promise, and had found it faithful and sure.\" One  would think, in hearing such a phraseology, he was listening to an  agent, vending a patent medicine as an infallible cure, or trying to  bring into use a labor-saving machine.    The Reviewer calls me to account for representing \"the Goodwin affair\"  as having had \"a very important relation to the Salem troubles,\" and  attempts to controvert that position.    On this point, Francis Hutchinson, before referred to, gives his views,  very decidedly, in the following passages: [_Pp. 95, 96, 101._] \"Mr.  Cotton Mather, no longer since than 1690, published the case of one  Goodwin's children. * * * The book was sent hither to be printed amongst  us, and Mr. Baxter recommended it to our people by a Preface, wherein he  says: 'That man must be a very obdurate Sadducee that will not believe  it.' The year after, Mr. Baxter, perhaps encouraged by Mr. Mather's  book, published his own _Certainty of the World of Spirits_, with  another testimony, 'That Mr. Mather's book would Silence any incredulity  that pretended to be rational.' And Mr. Mather dispersed Mr. Baxter's  book in New England, with the character of it, as a book that was  ungainsayable.\"    Speaking of Mather's book, Doctor Hutchinson proceeds: \"The judgment I  made of it was, that the poor old woman, being an Irish Papist, and not  ready in the signification of English words, had entangled herself by a  superstitious belief, and doubtful answers about Saints and Charms; and  seeing what advantages Mr. Mather made of it, I was afraid I saw part of  the reasons that carried the cause against her. And first it is manifest  that Mr. Mather is magnified as having great power over evil spirits. A  young man in his family is represented so holy, that the place of his  devotions was a certain cure of the young virgin's fits. Then his  grandfather's and father's books have gained a testimony, that, upon  occasion, may be _improved_ one knows not how far. For amongst the many  experiments that were made, Mr. Mather would bring to this young maid,  the Bible, the _Assembly's Catechism_, his grandfather Cotton's _Milk  for Babes_, his father's _Remarkable Providences_, and a book to prove  that there were Witches; and when any of these were offered for her to  read in, she would be struck dead, and fall into convulsions. 'These  good books,' he says, 'were mortal to her'; and lest the world should be  so dull as not to take him right, he adds, 'I hope I have not spoiled  the credit of the books, by telling how much the Devil hated them.'\"    This language, published by Doctor Hutchinson, in England, during the  life-time of the Mathers, shows how strong was the opinion, at that  time, that the writings of those two Divines were designed and used to  promote the prevalence of the Witchcraft superstition, and especially  that such was the effect, as well as the purpose, of Cotton Mather's  publication of the case of the Goodwin children, put into such  circulation, as it was, by him and Baxter, in both Old and New England.  In the same connection, Francis Hutchinson says: \"Observe the time of  the publication of that book, and of Mr. Baxter's. Mr. Mather's came out  in 1690, and Mr. Baxter's the year after; and Mr. Mather's father's  _Remarkable Providences_ had been out before that; and, in the year  1692, the frights and fits of the afflicted, and the imprisonment and  execution of Witches in New England, made as sad a calamity as a plague  or a war. I know that Mr. Mather, in his late Folio, imputes it to the  Indian Pawaws sending their spirits amongst them; but I attribute it to  Mr. Baxter's book, and his, and his father's, and the false principles,  and frightful stories, that filled the people's minds with great fears  and dangerous notions.\"    Our own Hutchinson, in his _History of Massachusetts_, [_II., 25-27_]  alludes to the excitement of the public mind, occasioned by the case of  the Goodwin children. \"I have often,\" he says, \"heard persons who were  of the neighborhood, speak of the great consternation it occasioned.\"    In citing this author, in the present discussion, certain facts are  always to be borne in mind. One of his sisters was the wife of Cotton  Mather's son, towards whom Hutchinson cherished sentiments appropriate  to such a near connection, and of which Samuel Mather was, there is no  reason to doubt, worthy. In the Preface to his first volume he speaks  thus: \"I am obliged to no other person more than to my friend and  brother, the Reverend Mr. Mather, whose library has been open to me, as  it had been before to the Reverend Mr. Prince, who has taken from thence  the greatest and most valuable part of what he had collected.\"    Moreover, this very library was, it can hardly be questioned, that of  Cotton Mather; of which, in his Diary, he speaks as \"very great.\" In an  interesting article, to which I may refer again, in the _Collections of  the Massachusetts Historical Society_, [_IV., ii., 128_], we are told  that, in the inventory of the estate of Cotton Mather, filed by his  Administrator, \"not a single book is mentioned among the assets of this  eccentric scholar.\" He had, it is to be presumed, given them all, in his  life-time, to his son, who succeeded to his ministry in the North  Church, in 1732.    When the delicacy of his relation to the Mather family and the benefit  he was deriving from that library are considered, the avoidance, by  Hutchinson, of any unpleasant reference to Cotton Mather, by name, is  honorable to his feelings. But he maintained, nevertheless, a faithful  allegiance to the truth of history, as the following, as well as many  other passages, in his invaluable work, strikingly show. They prove that  he regarded Mather's \"printed account\" of the case of the Goodwin  children, as having a very important relation to the immediately  subsequent delusion in Salem. \"The eldest was taken,\" he says, \"into a  Minister's family, where at first she behaved orderly, but after some  time suddenly fell into her fits.\" \"The account of her sufferings is in  print; some things are mentioned as extraordinary, which tumblers are  every day taught to perform; others seem more than natural; but it was a  time of great credulity. * * * The printed account was published with a  Preface by Mr. Baxter. * * * It obtained credit sufficient, together  with other preparatives, to dispose the whole country to be easily  imposed upon, by the more extensive and more tragical scene, which was  presently after acted at Salem and other parts of the county of Essex.\"  After mentioning several works published in England, containing  \"_witch-stories_,\" witch-trials, etc., he proceeds: \"All these books  were in New England, and the conformity between the behavior of  Goodwin's children, and most of the supposed be-witched at Salem, and  the behavior of those in England, is so exact, as to leave no room to  doubt the stories had been read by the New England persons themselves,  or had been told to them by others who had read them. Indeed this  conformity, instead of giving suspicion, was urged in confirmation of  the truth of both. The Old England demons and the New being so much  alike.\"    It thus appears that the opinion was entertained, in England and this  country, that the notoriety given to the case of the Goodwin children,  especially by Mather's printed account of it, had an efficient influence  in bringing on the \"tragical scene,\" shortly afterwards exhibited at  Salem. This opinion is shown to have been correct, by the extraordinary  similarity between them--the one being patterned after the other. The  Salem case, in 1692, was, in fact, a substantial repetition of the  Boston case, in 1688. On this point, we have the evidence of Cotton  Mather himself.    The Rev. John Hale of Beverly, who was as well qualified as any one to  compare them, having lived in Charlestown, which place had been the  residence of the Goodwin family, and been an active participator in the  prosecutions at Salem, in his book, entitled, _A modest Enquiry into  the nature of Witchcraft_, written in 1697, but not printed until 1702,  after mentioning the fact that Cotton Mather had published an account of  the conduct of the Goodwin children, and briefly describing the  manifestations and actions of the Salem girls, says: [_p. 24_] \"I will  not enlarge in the description of their cruel sufferings, because they  were, in all things, afflicted as bad as John Goodwin's children at  Boston, in the year 1689, as he, that will read Mr. Mather's book on  _Remarkable Providences_, p. 3. &c., may read part of what these  children, and afterwards sundry grown persons, suffered by the hand of  Satan, at Salem Village, and parts adjacent, _Anno 1691-2_, yet there  was more in their sufferings than in those at Boston, by pins invisibly  stuck into their flesh, pricking with irons (as, in part, published in a  book printed 1693, viz: _The Wonders of the Invisible World_).\" This is  proof of the highest authority, that, with the exceptions mentioned,  there was a perfect similarity in the details of the two cases. Mr.  Hale's book had not the benefit of his revision, as it did not pass  through the press until two years after his death; and we thus account  for the error as to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#6)"],[1,"also commenced to        outflank us.          \"'Meanwhile the remainder of the Aden Movable Column was        marching towards Lahej, but was delayed by water        difficulties and heavy going. It was therefore decided that        the small force at Lahej should fall back.          \"'The retirement was carried out successfully in the early        morning of July 5, and the detachment joined the rest of        the column at Bir Nasir. Our troops, however, were        suffering considerably from the great heat and the shortage        of water, and their difficulties were increased by the        desertion of Arab transport followers. It was therefore        decided to fall back to Aden, and this was done without the        enemy attempting to follow up.          \"'Our losses included three British officers wounded: names        will be communicated later. We took one Turkish officer (a        major) and thirteen men prisoners.'\"    Aden seems to have made no attempt to stem the tide of Turkish influence  while she could. The best fighting tribe in the protectorate stretches  along the coast and far inland north-east of Aden, and its capital is  only a few hours' steam from that harbour. The Turks made every effort  to win over this important tribal unit, which might have been a grave  menace on their left flank. Its sultan made frequent representations to  Aden for even a gunboat to show itself off his port, but to no purpose.  After the Turks had succeeded in alienating those of his tribe they  could get at, or who could get at them, a tardy political visit was paid  by sea from Aden. The indignant old sultan came aboard and spoke his  mind. \"You throw your friends on the midden,\" he said bitterly, and  departed to establish a _modus vivendi_ on his own account with the  Turks.    The situation at Aden has had a marked effect in bolstering up the  Turkish campaign of spurious pan-Islamism, and those of us who have been  dealing with chiefs in other parts of Arabia have met it at every turn.  It is idle to blame individuals--the whole system is at fault. The  policy of non-interference which the Liberal Government introduced,  after the Boundary Commission had finished its task and withdrawn, has  been over-strained by the Aden authorities to such an extent that they  would neither keep in direct personal touch themselves nor let anyone  else do so.    As an explorer and naturalist whose chief work has lain for years in  that country, I have made every effort to continue my researches there  until my persistency has incurred official persecution. The serious  aspect of this attitude is that at a time when accurate and up-to-date  knowledge of the hinterland would have been invaluable it was not  available. The pernicious policy of selecting any one chief (unchecked  by a European) to keep her posted as to affairs in her own protectorate  has been followed blindly by Aden to disaster. The excuse in official  circles there is that the Haushabi sultan had been suborned by the Turks  without their knowledge and he had prevented any information from  getting through Lahej to them. Can there be any more damning indictment  of such a system?    The Aden incident is similar to the Mesopotamian medical muddle, both  being due to sporadic dry-rot in high places which the test of war  revealed. The loyalty of its princes and the devotion of its army prove  that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with British rule in India to  command such sentiments, but some of those mandarins who have had wide  control of human affairs and destinies have ignored a situation until it  was forcibly thrust upon them and have fumbled with it disastrously. It  is difficult to bring such people to book, for they shuffle  responsibility from one to the other or take refuge in the truly  oriental pose of heaven-born officialdom. Such types should be obsolete  even in India by now, but this war has proved that they are not, and  when their inanities fritter away gallant lives and trail British  prestige in the dust they need rebuke. I hope some day, if I live, to  deal faithfully with Aden's hinterland policy.    In the autumn of 1915 I was fit enough to join the Red Sea maritime  patrol as political officer with the naval rank of lieutenant. Our  duties were to harry the Turk without hurting the Arab, to blockade the  Arabian coast against the Turk while allowing dhow-traffic with  foodstuffs consigned to Arab merchants and steamer-cargoes of food for  the alleged use of pilgrims to go through. Incidentally we had to keep  the eastern highway free of mines and transportable submarines, prevent  the passage of spies between Arabia and Egypt, and fetch and carry as  the shore-folk required.    Taking it all round, it was not an easy job, but I think the blockade  presented the most complex features. You knew where you were with  spies--anyone with the necessary experience could spot a doubtful  customer as soon as the dhow that carried him came alongside; and  irregular but frequent visits at the various ports soon put a stop to  the mine-industry and prevented any materialisation of the submarine  menace except in reports from Aden which caused me a good many  additional trips in an armed steam-cutter to \"go, look, see.\"    But the problems presented by the blockade required some solving with  very little time for the operation, and if your solution was not  approved by the authorities on the beach they lost no time in letting  you know it--usually by wireless, which was picked up by most ships in  the patrol by the time it reached you.    The basic idea was that if in doubt it was better to let stuff through  to the Turks than pinch Hejazi bellies and get ourselves disliked. In  theory this was perfectly sound, for we wanted the Hejaz to like us well  enough to fight on our side, and only the Huns think you can get people  to love you by afflicting them. In practice, however, we soon found that  the Hejazi merchants were selling direct to the Turks and letting their  fellow-countrymen have what was left at the highest possible price. On  top of it all India started a howl that her pilgrims in the Hejaz were  starving, and we had to defer to this outcry. I have never had to  legislate for highly-civilised Moslems with a taste for agitation, but I  have always sympathised with those who have, and could quite appreciate  India's position in the matter. Still, after comparing her relief  cargoes with the number of her pilgrims in the country and finding that  each had enough to feed him for the rest of his natural life, I ventured  to ask that this wholesale charity might cease, more especially as these  big steamer-cargoes were dealt with much as the dhow-borne cereals and  chiefly benefited the Turks and local profiteers.    As regards dhows, our rule was to allow coastal traffic from Jeddah and  empties returning there, as it tended to distribute food among the Arabs  and get it away from the Turks. Dhows bringing cargo from the African  coast or from Aden were permitted, provided they did not carry  contraband of war; this permitted native cereals, such as millet, but  barred wheat and particularly barred barley, which the local Arab does  not eat for choice, but which the Turks wanted very badly for their  cavalry.    In this connection a typical incident may be mentioned as illustrating  the sort of thing we were up against.    The ship I was serving in at the time lay off Jeddah and had three boats  down picketing the dhow-channels leading in to that reef-girt harbour,  for which dhows were making like homing bees. In such cases my post was  usually on the bridge, while the ship's interpreter and Arab-speaking  Seedee-boys went away in the boats. The dhows were reached and their  papers examined, then allowed to proceed if all was in order. Otherwise  the officer examining signalled the facts and awaited instructions.  Usually it was some technical point which I could waive, but on this  occasion one of the cutters made a signal to the effect that barley in  bulk had been found in one dhow. I was puzzled, because all the dhows  were from Suakin or further south, quite outside the barley-belt, except  on very high ground which rarely exports cereals. However, the signal  was repeated, and I had to have the dhow alongside. Meanwhile the  \"owner\" was anxious to get steerage-way, for we were not at anchor and  in very ticklish soundings; so I slid off the bridge and had a sample of  the grain handed up to me: it was a species of millet, looking very like  pearl-barley as \"milled\" for culinary purposes. I shouted to the _reis_  to go where he liked as long as he kept clear of our propellers, which  thereupon gave a ponderous flap or two as if to emphasise my remarks,  and he bore away from us rejoicing. In the ward-room later on I rallied  that cutter's officer on his error. \"Well, it was just like the barley  one sees in soup,\" was his defence.    In the southern part of the Red Sea, which was handled politically from  Aden, the problems of blockade were even more complex, for there even  arms and ammunition were allowed between certain ports to meet the  convenience of the Idrisi chief, who was theoretically at war with the  Turks, but rather diffident about putting his principles into practice,  especially after the Turkish success outside Aden.    This meant that the sorely-tried officers responsible for the conduct  of the blockade in those waters had frequently to decide on a cargo of  illicit-looking rifles and cartridges, not of Government make, but  purchased from private firms and guaranteed by a filthy scrap of paper  inscribed with crabbed Arabic which carried no conviction. All they had  to help them was the half-educated ship's interpreter, with no knowledge  of the political situation, for Aden had not an officer available for  this work. To enhance the difficulties of the position, some of these  coastal chiefs were"]]]
