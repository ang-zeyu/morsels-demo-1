[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#6)"],[1," floor, and on Sunday go to church.    With each verse the children dance hand in hand round the imaginary  juniper bush, singing lustily, and illustrating the different actions  of the washing operations. Finally, two and two and arm in arm,  they promenade round, as if going to church, and generally prolong  the walk while they sing the last verse a second time.    Another very favourite game is _Slaengkompas_, which is perhaps best  translated almost literally as Scatter-Compass. It is a rapid game,  and full of excitement. The players grasp hands in a circle and gallop  round, singing the refrain as they go:          \"Those who would join in _Slaengkompas_ must be tolerably quick!      One--two--three--and four--and five.      So comes _Slaengkompas_ again.\"      When the counting begins the players let go hands, and, clapping to  the tune, spin round separately until the word \"five\" is reached,  when they should be in position ready to join hands again and continue  to gallop round in the original circle.    The aim of the game is to keep things going until the verse has been  sung three times, but, of course, the players often become giddy and  lose their places.    There is not space to describe more of these ring dances here, but  there are many of them, and a great many which our English children  would do well to adopt.    Our good old street game of \"Hop-scotch\" you may see played  almost anywhere in Norway under the somewhat curious name of  \"Hop-in-Paradise,\" while in some parts \"Cat's Cradle,\" though a milder  form of amusement, is quite popular, and a large variety of figures  is known.    Then the girls are very fond of dressing up as brides, with crowns  and all, and having a mock wedding, with its accompanying procession  and dancing. Above all things they love dancing, and their fathers and  grandfathers play the fiddle for them for many an hour of a winter's  evening, while the mothers sing nursery rhymes to the smaller  children. And, as with the games, these jingles are more or less  the same as our own. They have \"This is the house that Jack built,\"  with the malt, and the rat, and everything, only that they prefer  the name Jacob to Jack. They have \"Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul\";  and the baby on his mother's knee has the joy of being shaken about to  \"This is the way the farmer rides, bumpety-bumpety-bump.\"            CHAPTER VII    SOME FAIRY TALES      Norwegian children are just as fond of fairy stories as are any  other children, and they are lucky in having a great number, for  that famous story-teller, Hans Christian Andersen, was a Dane, and  as the Danish language is very like the Norwegian, his stories were  probably known in Norway long before they were known in England. But  the Norwegians have plenty of other stories of their own, and they  love to sit by the fire of burning logs or round the stove in the  long winter evenings and listen to them. Of course, they know all  about people like Cinderella and Jack the Giant-Killer, but their  favourite hero is called by the name of Ashpot, who is sometimes a  kind of boy Cinderella and sometimes a Jack the Giant-Killer.    The following are two stories which the little yellow-haired Norse  children gloat over:    Once upon a time there was a man who had been out cutting wood, and  when he came home he found that he had left his coat behind, so he  told his little daughter to go and fetch it. The child started off,  but before she reached the wood darkness came on, and suddenly a  great big hill-giant swooped down upon her.    \"Please, Mr. Giant,\" said she, trembling all over, \"don't take me  away to-night, as father wants his coat; but to-morrow night, if you  will come when I go to the _stabbur_ to fetch the bread, I will go  away with you quite quietly.\"    So the giant agreed, and the next night, when she went to fetch the  bread, he came and carried her off. As soon as it was found that she  was missing, her father sent her eldest brother to look for her, but  he came back without finding her. The second brother was also sent,  but with no better result. At last the father turned to his youngest  son, who was the drudge of the house, and said: \"Now, Ashpot, you go  and see if you can find your sister.\"    So away went Ashpot, and no sooner had he reached the wood than he  met a bear.    \"Friend bear,\" said Ashpot, \"will you help me?\"    \"Willingly,\" answered the bear. \"Get up on my back.\"    And Ashpot mounted the bear's back and rode off. Presently they met  a wolf.    \"Friend wolf,\" said Ashpot, \"will you do some work for me ?\"    \"Willingly,\" answered the wolf.    \"Then jump up behind,\" said Ashpot, and the three went on deeper into  the wood.    They next met a fox, and then a hare, both of whom were enlisted into  Ashpot's service, and, mounted on the back of the bear, were swiftly  carried off to the giant's abode.    \"Good-day, Mr. Giant!\" said they.    \"Scratch my back!\" roared the giant, who lay stretched in front of  the fire warming himself.    The hare immediately climbed up and began to scratch as desired; but  the giant knocked him over, and down he fell on to the hearth-stone,  breaking off his fore-legs, since which time all hares have had  short fore-legs.    The fox next clambered up to scratch the giant's back, but he was  served like the hare. Then the wolf's turn came, but the giant said  that he was no better at scratching than the others.    \"_You_ scratch me!\" shouted the giant, turning impatiently to the bear.    \"All right,\" answered Bruin; \"I know all about scratching,\" and he  forthwith dug his claws into the giant's back and ripped it into a  thousand pieces.    Then all the beasts danced on the dead body of the monster, and  Ashpot recovered his sister and took her home, carrying off, at the  same time, all the giant's gold and silver. The bear and the wolf  burst into the cattle-sheds and devoured all the cows and sheep,  the fox feasted in the henroost, while the hare had the free run of  the oatfield. So everyone was satisfied.        The other story is also about Ashpot, whose two elder brothers  still treated him very badly, and eventually turned him out of his  home. Poor Ashpot wandered away up into the mountains, where he met  a huge giant. At first he was terribly afraid, but after a little  while he told the giant what had happened to him, and asked him if  he could find a job for him.    \"You are just the very man I want,\" said the giant. \"Come along  with me.\"    The first work to be done was to make a fire to brew some ale, so they  went off together to the forest to cut firewood. The giant carried a  club in place of an axe, and when they came to a large birch-tree he  asked Ashpot whether he would like to club the tree down or climb up  and hold the top of it. The boy thought that the latter would suit  him best, and he soon got up to the topmost branches and held on to  them. But the giant gave the tree such a blow with his club as to  knock it right out of the ground, sending Ashpot flying across the  meadows into a marsh. Luckily he landed on soft ground, and was none  the worse for his adventure; and they soon managed to get the tree  home, when they set to work to make a fire.    But the wood was green, and would not burn, so the giant began to  blow. At the first puff Ashpot found himself flying up to the ceiling  as if he had been a feather, but he managed to catch hold of a piece of  birch-bark among the rafters, and on reaching the ground again he told  the giant that he had been up to get something to make the fire burn.    The fire was soon burning splendidly, and the giant commenced to brew  the ale, drinking it off as fast as it was made. Ashpot watched him  getting gradually drunk, and heard him mutter to himself, \"To-night  I will kill him,\" so he began to think of a plan to outwit his  master. When he went to bed he placed the giant's cream-whisk between  the sheets as a dummy, while he himself crept under the bedstead.    In the middle of the night, just as he had expected, he heard the  giant come into his room, and then there was a tremendous whack as  the giant brought his club down on to the bed. Next morning the boy  came out of his room as if nothing had happened, and his master was  very much surprised to find him still alive.    \"Hullo!\" said the giant. \"Didn't you feel anything in the night?\"    \"I did feel something,\" said Ashpot; \"but I thought that it was only  a sausage-peg that had fallen on the bed, so I went to sleep again.\"    The giant was more astonished than ever, and went off to consult  his sister, who lived in a neighbouring mountain, and was about ten  times his size. At length it was settled that the giantess should  set her cooking-pot on the fire, and that Ashpot should be sent to  see her, when she was to tip him into the caldron and boil him. In  the course of the day the giant sent the boy off with a message to  his sister, and when he reached the giantess's dwelling he found her  busy cooking. But he soon saw through her design, and he took out of  his pocket a nut with a hole in it.    \"Look here,\" he said, showing the nut to the ogress, \"you think you  can do everything. I will tell you one thing that you can't do: you  can't make yourself so small as to be able to creep into the hole in  this nut.\"    \"Rubbish!\" replied the giantess. \"Of course I can!\"    And in a moment she became as small as a fly, and crept into the nut,  whereupon Ashpot hurled it into the fire, and that was the end of  the giantess.    The boy was so delighted that he returned to his old tyrant the giant  and told him what had happened to his sister. This set the big man  thinking again as to how he was to rid himself of this sharp-witted  little nuisance. He did not understand boys, and he was afraid of  Ashpot's tricks, so he offered him as much gold and silver as he  could carry if he would go away and never return. Ashpot, however,  replied that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24681"],[0,"Opportunities in Engineering (#6)"],[1,"concern, and himself a graduate in  electrical engineering, if the product be only a single line, and so  small a thing as spark-plugs, it will profit him greatly to read  whatever has been printed on the subject of spark-plugs. So with the  mining graduate in the matter of the different processes of recovering  minerals; so with the civil graduate, especially in the concrete field  of construction, which has made rapid strides in the past few years--the  graduate should absorb as much as he can of the available works printed  on the subject. Indeed, this is the profession of it, in that the  practitioner must ever be alive and alert to what is being done and has  been done from the beginning in his chosen line of endeavor.    Next must come fealty. The graduate on his first job must believe--and  if he does not believe ought to change connections--that the product of  his company is the best in the market. This need not necessarily be  true; but he must feel that it is true. For only in this way can he put  the best that is in him into his work. Industry--and the engineer is the  backbone of industry--is a hotbed of competition. Any organization needs  all the enthusiasm it can get. Greatest enthusiasm of all must come from  within its own circles. Lacking this enthusiasm within its own family,  the organization as a whole suffers. The graduate must first of all  supply enthusiasm to the source of his employment, because at first he  can supply but very little else. He must be true to his trust in ways  other than the mere doing of what he is told or producing what he is  expected to produce. This attitude cannot but help him qualify for  promotion, and rapidly. It is a very important factor in any engineer's  advancement.    Then there is the matter of patience. The writer knows of no other  qualification more fruitful of reward than patience. The word control is  frequently used in this regard--self-control. Its other name, however,  is patience--the thing that gives a man to try and try again until he  succeeds. Engineering is a difficult profession, though not more  difficult than other professions, and in the average engineer's  working-day many things occur which, if he be not possessed of infinite  patience, will serve to try him to a considerable degree. Patience with  those below him--patience with those above him--patience with  himself--these are all necessary and will prove helpful to him in  reaching the top. He must accept the petty tasks with a cheerfulness no  less apparent than he accepts the more important ones. He must present  his own ideas to his superiors with a degree of caution which, where the  ideas are rejected, will yet permit him to withdraw within himself  without giving the impression of being peeved. For engineering is above  all other things the interchange of ideas among men having an equal  training but a vastly different quality of experience. Men of diverse  experience thus drawn together make for a balanced engineering staff,  and a balanced engineering staff makes for a well-organized whole. The  young engineer must conduct himself in such a way that his superiors  will like him for what he is, as indicated by his personality, rather  than for what he knows or does in his daily work.    To sum up, then, the young engineer, having entered upon his first job,  must do three or four things in order quickly to qualify for promotion.  He first of all must spend time in study after his day's work is  done--absorb all information having to do with the company's own  product; hold himself ever alert to the company's own methods of  production; watch for an opportunity whereby this production may be  improved upon or the methods of production themselves improved upon. The  young engineer must proceed slowly in everything he undertakes; when  brought to a halt through difficulties he should instantly appeal to one  or another of his associates or superiors; he must be absolutely frank  in all his dealings with these associates and superiors. In this regard,  also, it might be said that the young graduate, following a habit become  almost second nature with him in his school-days, must keep a note-book  covering his activities throughout each working-day, a book wherein he  will jot down everything of value to him which comes up in the day's  work. Such books often form the basis of complete text-books in after  years, and, indeed, are acknowledged to be the foundation of more than  one recognized authority. Though in this regard, further, such a  practice is sometimes discouraged in some organizations, since it is  apparent that these note-books often contain facts which the  organization does not wish to have made public, being, as these notes  often are, in the nature of trade secrets. However, the student with a  conscience will effectively guard the secrets of his employer as  contained in his note-book, holding its contents for his own use in  furthering the interests of the company which employs him.    And finally--in the matter of personality--patience and regard for the  foibles of others will go far toward advancing the young engineer toward  success. He must never forget in his earlier years that he is embryonic  in the profession; that the profession is a difficult one and with many  ramifications; that if he was able to live through three normal lives he  would yet know only a very little of what there is to know about his  chosen work. Thus he will conduct himself in a manner designed to win  the interest and affection of men who are superior to him. Life to-day  consists more than ever of service, and no man can go the path alone.  Service--assistance one to another--makes up the sum total of life. No  engineering graduate--no young man in any walk of life--can progress far  without assistance, however brilliant as a student and capable as a man  he may be. If he will but bear this last in mind--this and the other  even more important truth, that as a man gives so shall he  receive--that a dollar spent in charity means two dollars in the bank--I  mean that exactly--then the heights themselves will beckon to him at an  early age.    \"Early to bed and early to rise\"; \"take care of the pennies and the  dollars will take care of themselves\"; \"a bird in the hand is worth two  in the bush\"--we don't need--the engineering graduate does not  need--that form of admonition. It means nothing and is false. What alone  counts for success is a considerable regard for the rights and  privileges of others, the unfortunate as well as the fortunate. Greed  never brought success that was lasting to any one, and certainly it  breeds unhappiness. Engineering is a work of service--service to  others--and to the graduate who \"gets\" this truism will come all things  of this life, not the least of which will be material rewards.          VII    THE CONSULTING ENGINEER      The consulting engineer represents the pinnacle, as it were, of  professional success. The inventor is something else--a wilding in the  profession--and as such cannot be considered in a paper of this kind,  save only as to say that he is the presiding genius among engineers, the  Shakespeare or Milton among his kind, a man whose path to the heights is  nowhere known of men. The consulting engineer, on the contrary,  representing, as he does, the zenith of slowly attained power in some  certain branch of engineering, a vantage--point open freely to all, is  the embodiment of the goal toward which all graduates should strive. The  consulting engineer has perfected himself in his chosen field; he has  become an authority in his branch of engineering; his word is accepted  as final in court and privy council. Having gained to this enviable  position only after prolonged study and protracted and wide experience  in his particular specialty, the consulting engineer has well earned  whatever accrues to him in the way, among other things, of generous fees  for his services.    Still, there are consulting engineers who have become so through  accident. The writer personally knows a consulting engineer who was  following a general engineering practice when called upon one day to  advise a group of capitalists in the matter of a garbage-disposal plant  of new design for a large mid-Western city. His services were sought not  because he was a garbage expert, but rather because he was expert in  intricate pipe layouts and the like. However, once he got his hand into  garbage disposition on a large scale, he remained in this branch of  engineering, eventually traveling about the country supervising the  design of similar plants whose object was the economical disposal of  municipal refuse. Practically alone in the field, his writings soon  became accepted as authoritative, and yet the whole thing began with  that first call, quite by chance, in a matter foreign to the subject.  Like other professional men, engineers never know when the heavens will  open for their particular benefit.    Yet these cases are rare. The average consulting engineer is a man who  has won to pre-eminence only through protracted study and hard work in  one line. He is a specialist with a high reputation for accuracy and  skill in that line. The basis of this skill, of course, lies in a broad  general engineering experience, upon which is built a peculiar knowledge  of a certain, and not infrequently isolated, branch of engineering.  Heating and ventilating engineers are but specialists grown to such  large numbers as to form a definite branch of engineering. Likewise,  automotive engineers are men who have specialized through long years in  this branch. The man who knows more about building dredges, say, than  any other man among his engineering brothers is a man who will be most  frequently sought by industrial powers feeling the need for a dredge,  just as a man suffering eye-strain will seek out the best specialist  known to the medical fraternity."]]]
