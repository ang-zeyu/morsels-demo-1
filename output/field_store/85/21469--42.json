What is the meaning of this?\"    \"I don't profess to know the meaning of it,\" said Cecil Barker; \"but I  have seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.\"    \"And so have I,\" said the butler. \"Many a time when the master has  rolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I've often wondered  what it could be.\"    \"Then it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,\" said the sergeant.  \"But it's a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum.  Well, what is it now?\"    The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at  the dead man's outstretched hand.    \"They've taken his wedding ring!\" he gasped.    \"What!\"    \"Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the  little finger of his left hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it  was above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third finger. There's  the nugget and there's the snake, but the wedding ring is gone.\"    \"He's right,\" said Barker.    \"Do you tell me,\" said the sergeant, \"that the wedding ring was BELOW  the other?\"    \"Always!\"    \"Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you call  the nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget  ring back again.\"    \"That is so!\"    The worthy country policeman shook his head. \"Seems to me the sooner we  get London on to this case the better,\" said he. \"White Mason is a smart  man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It won't be  long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we'll have to look  to London before we are through. Anyhow, I'm not ashamed to say that it  is a deal too thick for the likes of me.\"          Chapter 4--Darkness        At three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the urgent  call from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a  light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-forty train in  the morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard, and he was at the  Birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us. White Mason was  a quiet, comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit, with a  clean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs  adorned with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired gamekeeper,  or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the  provincial criminal officer.    \"A real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!\" he kept repeating. \"We'll  have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I'm hoping  we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and  messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that I can  remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr. Holmes,  or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos will have  a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville Arms.  There's no other place; but I hear that it is clean and good. The man  will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you please.\"    He was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In ten  minutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated in the  parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events  which have been outlined in the previous chapter. MacDonald made an  occasional note; while Holmes sat absorbed, with the expression of  surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the  rare and precious bloom.    \"Remarkable!\" he said, when the story was unfolded, \"most remarkable! I  can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.\"    \"I thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,\" said White Mason in great  delight. \"We're well up with the times in Sussex. I've told you now  how matters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson  between three and four this morning. My word! I made the old mare go!  But I need not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out; for there  was nothing immediate that I could do. Sergeant Wilson had all the  facts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my  own.\"    \"What were they?\" asked Holmes eagerly.    \"Well, I first had the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood there to  help me. We found no signs of violence upon it. I was hoping that if Mr.  Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his mark  upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was no  stain.\"    \"That, of course, proves nothing at all,\" remarked Inspector MacDonald.  \"There has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.\"    \"Quite so. It doesn't prove it wasn't used. But there might have been  stains, and that would have helped us. As a matter of fact there were  none. Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot cartridges, and, as  Sergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that,  if you pulled on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged. Whoever  fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances  of missing his man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot long--one  could carry it easily under one's coat. There was no complete maker's  name; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the  barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.\"    \"A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?\" asked Holmes.    \"Exactly.\"    \"Pennsylvania Small Arms Company--well-known American firm,\" said  Holmes.    White Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks  at the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties  that perplex him.    \"That is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful!  Wonderful! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in  your memory?\"    Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave.    \"No doubt it is an American shotgun,\" White Mason continued. \"I seem  to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of  America. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to  me. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house and  killed its master was an American.\"    MacDonald shook his head. \"Man, you are surely travelling overfast,\"  said he. \"I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the  house at all.\"    \"The open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, the marks of  boots in the corner, the gun!\"    \"Nothing there that could not have been arranged. Mr. Douglas was an  American, or had lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You don't  need to import an American from outside in order to account for American  doings.\"    \"Ames, the butler--\"    \"What about him? Is he reliable?\"    \"Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos--as solid as a rock. He has been  with Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago. He has  never seen a gun of this sort in the house.\"    \"The gun was made to conceal. That's why the barrels were sawed. It  would fit into any box. How could he swear there was no such gun in the  house?\"    \"Well, anyhow, he had never seen one.\"    MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. \"I'm not convinced yet  that there was ever anyone in the house,\" said he. \"I'm asking you to  conseedar\" (his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his  argument) \"I'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose  that this gun was ever brought into the house, and that all these  strange things were done by a person from outside. Oh, man, it's just  inconceivable! It's clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr.  Holmes, judging it by what we have heard.\"    \"Well, state your case, Mr. Mac,\" said Holmes in his most judicial  style.    \"The man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. The ring  business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private  reason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the  deliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows  anything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the  house is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose? You would  say the most silent in the world. Then he could hope when the deed was  done to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away  at his leisure. That's understandable. But is it understandable that  he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he  could select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the  house to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that  he will be seen before he can get across the moat? Is that credible, Mr.  Holmes?\"    \"Well, you put the case strongly,\" my friend replied thoughtfully.  \"It certainly needs a good deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White  Mason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see  if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?\"    \"There were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a stone ledge, and one could  hardly expect them.\"    \"No tracks or marks?\"    \"None.\"    \"Ha! Would there be any objection, Mr. White Mason, to our going down to  the house at once? There may possibly be some small point which might be  suggestive.\"    \"I was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put you  in touch with all the facts before we go. I suppose if anything should  strike you--\" White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur.    \"I have worked with Mr. Holmes before,\" said Inspector MacDonald. \"He  plays the game.\"    \"My own idea of the game, at any rate,\" said Holmes, with a smile. \"I go  into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police. If  I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because they  have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to score at  their expense.

To continue the portrait: his head and face are  small in proportion to his height; his complexion swarthy; the muscles  of his face, being relaxed, give him the appearance of a man of fifty  years of age, nor can he be much younger; his countenance has a faithful  expression of great good humour and hilarity; while his black eyes  that unerring index--possess an irradiating spirit, which proclaims the  imperial powers of the mind that sits enthroned within.\"    The \"British Spy\" then describes Marshall's personality as an orator at  the time when he was still practicing at the Virginia bar:    \"His voice [the description continues] is dry and hard; his attitude, in  his most effective orations, was often extremely awkward, as it was not  unusual for him to stand with his left foot in advance, while all  his gestures proceeded from his right arm, and consisted merely in a  vehement, perpendicular swing of it from about the elevation of his head  to the bar, behind which he was accustomed to stand.... [Nevertheless]  if eloquence may be said to consist in the power of seizing the  attention with irresistible force, and never permitting it to elude the  grasp until the hearer has received the conviction which the speaker  intends, [then] this extraordinary man, without the aid of fancy,  without the advantages of person, voice, attitude, gesture, or any of  the ornaments of an orator, deserves to be considered as one of the most  eloquent men in the world.... He possesses one original, and, almost,  supernatural faculty; the faculty of developing a subject by a single  glance of his mind, and detecting at once, the very point on which every  controversy depends. No matter what the question; though ten times more  knotty than the gnarled oak, the lightning of heaven is not more rapid  nor more resistless, than his astonishing penetration. Nor does the  exercise of it seem to cost him an effort. On the contrary, it is as  easy as vision. I am persuaded that his eyes do not fly over a landscape  and take in its various objects with more promptitude and facility, than  his mind embraces and analyzes the most complex subject.    \"Possessing while at the bar this intellectual elevation, which enables  him to look down and comprehend the whole ground at once, he determined  immediately and without difficulty, on which side the question might  be most advantageously approached and assailed. In a bad cause his art  consisted in laying his premises so remotely from the point directly in  debate, or else in terms so general and so spacious, that the hearer,  seeing no consequence which could be drawn from them, was just as  willing to admit them as not; but his premises once admitted, the  demonstration, however distant, followed as certainly, as cogently, as  inevitably, as any demonstration in Euclid.    \"All his eloquence consists in the apparently deep self-conviction, and  emphatic earnestness of his manner, the correspondent simplicity and  energy of his style; the close and logical connexion of his thoughts;  and the easy gradations by which he opens his lights on the attentive  minds of his hearers.    \"The audience are never permitted to pause for a moment. There is no  stopping to weave garlands of flowers, to hang in festoons, around a  favorite argument. On the contrary, every sentence is progressive; every  idea sheds new light on the subject; the listener is kept perpetually  in that sweetly pleasurable vibration, with which the mind of man always  receives new truths; the dawn advances in easy but unremitting pace; the  subject opens gradually on the view; until, rising in high relief, in  all its native colors and proportions, the argument is consummated by  the conviction of the delighted hearer.\"    What appeared to Marshall's friends as most likely in his early middle  years to stand in the way of his advancement was his addiction to ease  and to a somewhat excessive conviviality. But it is worth noting that  the charge of conviviality was never repeated after he was appointed  Chief Justice; and as to his unstudious habits, therein perhaps lay one  of the causes contributing to his achievement. Both as attorney and as  judge, he preferred the quest of broad, underlying principles, and, with  plenty of time for recuperation from each exertion, he was able to bring  to each successive task undiminished vitality and unclouded attention.  What the author of the \"Leviathan\" remarks of himself may well be  repeated of Marshall--that he made more use of his brains than of his  bookshelves and that, if he had read as much as most men, he would have  been as ignorant as they.    That Marshall was one of the leading members of his profession in  Virginia, the most recent biographical researches unmistakably prove.  \"From 1790 until his election to Congress nine years later,\" Albert J.  Beveridge * writes, \"Marshall argued 113 cases decided by the court  of appeals of Virginia.... He appeared during this time in practically  every important cause heard and determined by the supreme tribunal of  the State.\" Practically all this litigation concerned property rights,  and much of it was exceedingly intricate. Marshall's biographer also  points out the interesting fact that \"whenever there was more than  one attorney for the client who retained Marshall, the latter almost  invariably was retained to make the closing argument.\" He was thus able  to make good any lack of knowledge of the technical issues involved  as well as to bring his great debating powers to bear with the best  advantage.       * \"The Life of John Marshall,\" vol. II, p. 177.      Meanwhile Marshall was also rising into political prominence. From  the first a supporter of Washington's Administration, he was gradually  thrust into the position of Federalist leader in Virginia. In 1794 he  declined the post of Attorney-General, which Washington had offered him.  In the following year he became involved in the acrimonious struggle  over the Jay Treaty with Great Britain, and both in the Legislature and  before meetings of citizens defended the treaty so aggressively that its  opponents were finally forced to abandon their contention that it was  unconstitutional and to content themselves with a simple denial that it  was expedient. Early in 1796 Marshall made his first appearance before  the Supreme Court, in the case of Ware vs. Hylton. The fame of his  defense of \"the British Treaty\" during the previous year had preceded  him, and his reception by the Federalist leaders from New York and New  England was notably cordial. His argument before the Court, too, though  it did not in the end prevail, added greatly to his reputation. \"His  head,\" said Rufus King, who heard the argument, \"is one of the best  organized of any one that I have known.\"    Either in 1793 or early in the following year, Marshall participated in  a business transaction which, though it did not impart to his political  and constitutional views their original bent, yet must have operated  more or less to confirm his opinions. A syndicate composed of Marshall,  one of his brothers, and two other gentlemen, purchased from the British  heirs what remained of the great Fairfax estate in the Northern Neck, a  tract \"embracing over 160,000 acres of the best land in Virginia.\" By an  Act passed during the Revolution, Virginia had decreed the confiscation  of all lands held by British subjects; and though the State had never  prosecuted the forfeiture of this particular estate, she was always  threatening to do so. Marshall's investment thus came to occupy for many  years a precarious legal footing which, it may be surmised, did not a  little to keep alert his natural sympathy for all victims of legislative  oppression. Moreover the business relation which he formed with Robert  Morris in financing the investment brought him into personal contact for  the first time with the interests behind Hamilton's financial program,  the constitutionality of which he had already defended on the hustings.    It was due also to this business venture that Marshall was at last  persuaded to break through his rule of declining office and to accept  appointment in 1797, together with Pinckney and Gerry, on the famous  \"X.Y.Z. \"mission to France. From this single year's employment he  obtained nearly $20,000, which, says his biographer, \"over and above  his expenses,\" was \"three times his annual earnings at the bar\"; and the  money came just in the nick of time to save the Fairfax investment, for  Morris was now bankrupt and in jail. But not less important as a  result of his services was the enhanced reputation which Marshall's  correspondence with Talleyrand brought him. His return to Philadelphia  was a popular triumph, and even Jefferson, temporarily discomfited by  the \"X.Y.Z.\" disclosures, found it discreet to go through the form of  paying him court--whereby hangs a tale. Jefferson called at Marshall's  tavern. Marshall was out. Jefferson thereupon left a card deploring how  \"unlucky\" he had been. Commenting years afterwards upon the occurrence,  Marshall remarked that this was one time at least when Jefferson came  NEAR telling the truth.    Through the warm insistence of Washington, Marshall was finally  persuaded in the spring of 1799 to stand as Federalist candidate for  Congress in the Richmond district. The expression of his views at this  time is significant. A correspondent of an Alexandria newspaper signing  himself \"Freeholder\" put to him a number of questions intended to call  forth Marshall's opinions on the issues of the day. In answering a query  as to whether he favored an alliance with Great Britain, the candidate  declared that the whole of his \"politics respecting foreign nations\" was  \"reducible to"]]]
