About ten meters farther on, the ground sloped up sharply to form a  ridge rising a meter and a half above the rest of the terrain. The water  had not reached its blunted top, and on this fairly level strip of  ground, perhaps three meters wide, Algol had been paralleling their path  in dry-pawed comfort.    \"Scientists!\" Louisa Bernardi almost spat. \"Professors! We could have  been walking on that, too. But did anybody think to look for dry  ground? No! It was wet in one place, so it would be wet in another. Oh,  Algol--\" she reached over to embrace the cat--\"you're smarter than any  so-called intelligent life-forms.\"    He indignantly straightened a whisker she had crumpled.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Look,\" Mortland exclaimed in delight as they attained the top of the  ridge, \"here are some dryish twigs! Don't suppose the trees want them,  since they've let them fall. If I can get a fire going, we could boil  some swamp water and make tea. Nasty thought, but it's better than no  tea at all. And how long can one go on living without tea?\"    \"We'll need some food before long, too,\" Professor Bernardi observed,  putting his briefcase down on a fallen log. \"The usual procedure, I  believe, would be for us to draw straws to see which gets  eaten--although there isn't any hurry.\"    \"I'm glad then that we'll be able to have a fire,\" Mortland said, busily  collecting twigs. \"I should hate to have to eat you raw, Carl.\"    _Mr. Pitt and his little friend are delightful creatures_, Mrs. Bernardi  thought. _So intelligent and so well behaved. But eating them wouldn't  really be cannibalism. They aren't people._    _That premise works both ways, dear lady_, Jrann-Pttt ideated. _And I  must say your species will prove far easier to peel for the cooking  pot._    \"Monster! What are you doing?\" Mortland dropped his twigs and pulled the  mosquito-bat away from a bush. \"Don't eat those berries, you silly ass;  the bush won't like it!\" The mosquito-bat piped wrathfully.    Jrann-Pttt probed with intentness. \"You know, I rather think the bush  wants its berries to be eaten. Something to do with--er--propagating  itself. Of course it has a false impression as to what is going to be  done with the berries, but the important fact is that it won't put up  any resistance.\"    \"All right, old fellow.\" Mortland released the mosquito-bat, which  promptly flew back to the bush. \"I'm not the custodian of your morals.\"    \"I wonder whether we could eat those berries, too,\" Professor Bernardi  remarked pensively.    \"Carl!\" Mrs. Bernardi's tear-stained face flushed pink. \"Why--why,  that's almost indecent!\"    \"We eat beans, don't we?\" Mortland pointed out. \"They're seeds.\"    \"We also eat meat,\" Miss Anspacher added.    There was silence. \"I imagine,\" Mrs. Bernardi murmured, \"it's because  we never get to meet the meat socially.\" She avoided the saurians' eyes.    \"We'd better see how Monster makes out, though,\" Miss Anspacher  observed, replenishing her lipstick, \"before we try the berries  ourselves. The fact that the bush is anxious to dispose of them doesn't  mean they can't be poisonous.\"    \"Why should Monster sacrifice himself for us?\" Mortland retorted hotly,  overlooking the fact that Monster's purpose in eating the berries was  almost certainly not an altruistic one. \"If we can risk his life, we can  risk our own.\" He crammed a handful of berries into his mouth defiantly.  \"I say, they're good!\"    Algol sniffed the bush with disgust, then turned away.    \"See?\" said Miss Anspacher. \"They're undoubtedly poisonous. When he's  really hungry, he isn't so fussy.\" She combed her hair.    \"But is he really hungry?\" Bernardi asked suspiciously. \"Come here,  Algol. Nice kitty.\" He bent down and sniffed the cat's breath. The cat  sniffed his interestedly. Their whiskers touched. \"I thought so. Fish!\"    \"You mean,\" Mrs. Bernardi shrieked, \"that while we were struggling  through that water, alternately starving and drowning by centimeters,  that wretched cat has not only been walking along here dry as toast, but  gorging himself on fish?\"    \"Now, now, Mrs. Bernardi,\" Jrann-Pttt said. \"Being a dumb animal, he  wouldn't think of informing you about matters of which he'd assume that  you, as the superior beings, would be fully cognizant.\"    \"You might have told us there were fish on this planet, Mr. Pitt.\"    \"Dear lady, there is something I feel I should tell you. I am not--\"    \"They're here on the other side of the ridge,\" Greenfield called,  bending over and peering through the foliage. \"The fish, I mean.\"    \"The pools look shallow,\" Bernardi said, also bending over. \"The fish  should be easy enough to catch. Might even be able to get them in our  hands.\" He reached out to demonstrate, proving the error of both his  theses, for the fish slipped right through his fingers and, as he  grabbed for them, he lost his balance, toppled over the side of the  ridge into the mud and water below and began to disappear, showing  beyond a doubt that the pools were deeper than he had thought.    \"Carl, what are you doing?\" Mrs. Bernardi peered into the murky depths  where her husband was threshing about. \"Why don't you come out of that  filthy mud?\"    His voice, though muffled, was still acid. \"It isn't mud, my dear. It's  quicksand!\"    \"Rope!\" the captain exclaimed, grabbing a coil.    \"Hold on, chaps!\" cried a squeaky voice. \"I'm coming to the rescue!\" A  stout twelve-foot vine plunged out of the shadows and wrapped one end of  itself around a tree--disregarding the latter's violent objections--and  the other end around Professor Bernardi's thorax, which was just  disappearing into the mud. \"Now if one or two of you would haul away,  we'll soon have him out all shipshape and proper. Heave ho! Don't be  afraid of hurting me; my strength is as the strength of ten because my  heart is pure.\"    \"It's that vine!\" Dfar-Lll exclaimed. \"So that's what has been following  us all along!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"I can accept the idea of a vegetable thinking,\" Professor Bernardi  gasped as he was pulled out of the quicksand, \"although with the utmost  reluctance.\" He shook himself like a dog. \"But how can it be mobile?\"    \"You chaps can move around,\" the vine explained, \"so I said to myself:  'Dammit, I'll have a shot at doing that, too.' Hard going at first, when  you're using suckers, but I persevered and I made it. Look, I can talk,  too. Never heard of a vine doing that before, did you? Fact is, I hadn't  thought of it before, but then I never had anyone to communicate with.  All those other vines are so stupid; you have absolutely no idea! Hope  you don't mind my picking up your language, but it was the only one  around--\"    \"We are honored,\" Professor Bernardi declared. \"And I am deeply grateful  to you, too, sir or madam, for saving my life.\"    \"Think nothing of it,\" the vine said, arranging its leaves, which were  of a pleasing celadon rather than the whitish-green favored by the rest  of the local vegetation. \"Now that I can move, I'll probably be doing  heroic things like that all the time. Are you all going to the city? May  I go with you? I've heard lots about the city,\" it went on, taking  consent for granted, \"but I never thought I'd get to see it. Everybody  in the swamp is such an old stick-in-the-mud. I thought I was trapped,  too, forced to spend the rest of my life in a provincial environment. Is  it true that the streets are filled with chlorophyll? Do you think I can  get a job in a botanical garden or something? Perhaps I can give little  talks on horticulture to visitors?\"    The mosquito-bat looked out of the tea kettle austerely. \"Monster!\" it  piped shrilly.    \"The very idea!\" the vine snapped back indignantly. \"Oh, well,\" it said,  calming down, \"you probably don't know any better. It's up to me as the  intelligent life-form to forgive you, and I shall.\"    Jrann-Pttt and Dfar-Lll looked at each other in consternation. _Do you  think there really are cities on this planet, sir? Can there be  indigenous intelligent life? If so, it may have already got in touch  with the commandant._    _Impossible_, Jrann-Pttt replied. _The vine probably just heard us  talking about a city. After all, it picked up the language that way;  very likely it absorbed some terrestrial concepts along with it. If  there are any real settlements at all, they must be quite  primitive--nothing more than villages. No, it's we who will build the  cities on Venus. Combining our technology with the terrestrials', we  could develop a pretty little civilization here--after we've disposed of  the commandant, so he can't report our disappearance. We don't want any  publicity. So much better to keep our little society exclusive._           *       *       *       *       *    \"Wonder what time it is,\" the captain remarked as he rose and stretched  in the dim yellow light of the long Venusian day. \"Must have slept for  hours. My watch seems to have stopped.\"    \"Mine, too.\" Mortland unstrapped his from his wrist and shook it  futilely. \"Waterproof, hah! If we ever get back to Earth, I shall make  the manufacturer eat his guarantee.\"    \"Oh, well, what does time matter to us now?\" Professor Bernardi pointed  out as he rose from his leafy couch with a loud creak. All of them--even  the saurians--had aches and pains in every joint and muscle as a result  of the unaccustomed exercise and the damp climate. \"We are out of its  reach. It has no present meaning for us.\"    This depressed them all. Only the vine seemed in good health and  spirits. \"I notice you're all wearing clothes except for the short  four-legged gentleman with the home-grown fur coat,\" it chattered  happily. \"Do you think I'll be socially acceptable without them? I  wouldn't want to make a bad impression at the very start--or would  leaves do?\"    Everybody"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],[0,"What Bird is That? (#6)"],[1," April.      RED-TAILED HAWK    _Buteo borealis borealis. Case 1, Figs. 5, 6; Case 3, Fig. 13._              This, the largest of our common Hawks, is a            heavy-bodied bird with wings which when closed,            reach nearly to the end of the tail. The adult has            the tail bright reddish brown with a narrow black            band near the tip. The immature bird has the tail            rather inconspicuously barred with blackish, and a            broken band of blackish spots across the            underparts. L. male, 20; female, 23.              _Range._ Eastern North America, migrating only at            the northern limit of its range. There are several            races, Krider's Red-tail, a paler form inhabiting            the great Plains, and Harlan's Hawk, a darker form            with a mottled tail, the lower Mississippi Valley.              Washington, common W.V., rare S.R. Ossining,            common P.R., less common in winter. Cambridge,            rare T.V., locally W.V., Oct. 10-Apl. 20. N. Ohio,            common P.R. Glen Ellyn, P.R., not common, chiefly            T.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 2.    The Red-tail resembles the Red-shoulder in general habits, but it is  more a bird of the fields, where it may be seen perched on the limb of a  dead tree or similar exposed situation. Its note, a long-drawn,  squealing whistle, is quite unlike that of the Red-shoulder. The  Red-tail feeds chiefly on mice and other small mammals. With the  Red-shoulder it is often called 'Chicken Hawk,' but does not deserve the  name. It nests in trees 30-70 feet up and in April lays 2-4 eggs, dull  white sparingly marked with brown.      RED-SHOULDERED HAWK    _Buteo lineatus lineatus. Case 1, Fig. 4; Case 3 Fig. 12_    [Illustration: RED-SHOULDERED HAWK. ADULT.    Note the Barred Tail.]              Seen from below the reddish brown underparts and            black and white barred tail will identify adults            of this species. Immature birds are streaked below            with blackish; the tail is dark grayish brown            indistinctly barred, but the shoulder is always            rusty, though this is not a marking one can see in            life. L., male. 18-1/2; female, 20-1/4.              _Range._ Eastern North America from northern            Florida to Canada; resident except in the northern            part of its range.              Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, common, Apl.-Nov., less common in            winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, P.R.,            more common than the Red-tail; chiefly T.V.    A medium-sized, heavy-bodied Hawk with wings which, when closed, reach  well toward the tip of the tail. It lives both in the woods and open  places, and may be flushed from the border of a brook or seen soaring  high in the air. Its note, frequently uttered, as it swings in wide  circles, is a distinctive _Kee-you, Kee-you_, quite unlike the call of  any of our other Hawks. It is often well imitated by the Blue Jay. The  Red-shoulder feeds chiefly on mice and frogs. It nests in trees 30-60  feet up and, in April, lays 3-5 eggs, white marked with brown.    The Florida Red-shouldered Hawk (_Buteo lineatus alleni_), a smaller  form with grayer head and paler underparts, is a resident in Florida and  along the coast from South Carolina to Mexico. It nests in February.      BROAD-WINGED HAWK    _Buteo platypterus_              With a general resemblance to the Red-shouldered            Hawk, but smaller; no red on the bend of the wing,            or rusty in the primaries, only the outer three of            which are 'notched.' L., male, 15-3/4; female,            16-3/4.              _Range._ Eastern North America. Breeding from the            Gulf States to the St. Lawrence; winters from Ohio            and Delaware to S.A.; migrates northward in March.              Washington, uncommon P.R. Ossining, tolerably            common S.R., Mch. 15-Oct. 23. Cambridge, uncommon            T.V. in early fall, rare in spring and summer;            Apl. 25-Sept. 30. N. Ohio, not common P.R. Glen            Ellyn, not common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 4. SE. Minn.,            common S.R., Mch. 11.    A rather retiring, unwary Hawk which nests in thick woods and is less  often seen in the open than the Red-shoulder, but, when migrating,  hundreds pass high in the air, with other Hawks. Its call is a high,  thin, penetrating whistle. It nests in late April and early May, laying  2-4 whitish eggs marked with brown.      ROUGH-LEGGED HAWK    _Archibuteo lagopus sancti-johannis_              Legs feathered to the toes; basal half of tail            white; belly black. Some individuals are wholly            black. L., male, 21; female, 23.              _Range._ Breeds in northern Canada; usually rare            and irregular in the northern U.S., from November            to April.              Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining,            casual. Cambridge, T.V., not common, Nov.-Dec.;            Mch.-Apl. N. Ohio, not common W.V., Nov. 20-Apl.            3. Glen Ellyn, quite common W.V., Oct. 12-Apl. 30.            SE. Minn., W.V., Oct. 15-Mch.    Frequents fields and marshes, where it hunts to and fro after mice,  which form its principal fare.      GOLDEN EAGLE    _Aquila chrysaetos_              With the Bald Eagle, largest of our raptorial            birds; with a general resemblance to the young of            that species, in which the head and tail are dark,            but with the legs feathered to the toes. L., male,            32-1/2; female, 37-1/2.              _Range._ Northern parts of the northern            Hemisphere; in the United States, rare east of the            Mississippi.              Washington, rare W.V., Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, 1            record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE. Minn., P.R.    The Golden Eagle is so rare in the eastern United States and its general  resemblance to a young Bald Eagle is so close, that only an experienced  ornithologist could convince me that he had seen a Golden Eagle east of  the Mississippi.      BALD EAGLE    _Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus. Case 3, Fig. 11_              When immature the head and tail resemble the body            in color, and at this age the bird is sometimes            confused with the more western Golden Eagle. The            latter has the head browner and the legs feathered            to the toes. L., male, 33; female, 35-1/2.              _Range._ North America but rare in the interior            and in California, migratory at the northern limit            of its range.              Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, of irregular occurrence at all seasons.            N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. SE. Minn., P.R.,            becoming rare.    An adult Bald Eagle will at once be recognized by its white head and  tail; the immature birds by their large size. Eagles are usually found  near the water where fish may be obtained either on the shore or from  the Osprey. The call of the male is a human-like, loud, clear  _cac-cac-cac_; that of the female is said to be more harsh and often  broken. Eagles nest in tall trees and on cliffs, and lay two or three  dull white eggs, in Florida, in November and December; in Maine, in  April.          FALCONS, CARACARAS, ETC. FAMILY FALCONIDAE      GYRFALCON    _Falco rusticolus gyrfalco_              A large Hawk with long, pointed wings, the upper            parts brown with numerous narrow, buffy bars or            margins, the tail evenly barred with grayish and            blackish, the underparts white lightly streaked            with black. L. 22.              _Range._ Arctic regions; south in winter rarely to            New York and Minnesota. The Gray Gyrfalcon (_F. r.            rusticolus_) a paler form, with a streaked crown,            the Black Gyrfalcon (_F. r. obsoletus_) a            slate-colored race, and the White Gyrfalcon (_F.            islandus_) are also rare winter visitants to the            northern United States.    These great Falcons are so rare in the United States that unless they  are seen by an experienced observer, under exceptionally favorable  conditions, authentic records of their visits can be based only on the  actual capture of specimens.      DUCK HAWK    _Falco peregrinus anatum_              The adult is slaty blue above; buff below marked            with black, and with black cheek-patches. Immature            birds are blackish above margined with rusty,            below deep rusty buff streaked with blackish. L.,            male, 16; female, 19.              _Range._ Northern Hemisphere, breeding south            locally to New Jersey and in Alleghanies to South            Carolina; winters from New Jersey southward.              Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining,            casual. Cambridge, rare T.V., casual in winter,            SE. Minn., uncommon S.R., Apl. 4.    As the Peregrine of falconry we know of the Duck Hawk as a fearless,  dashing hunter of greater power of wing and talon. It nests in rocky  cliffs in April and from its eyrie darts upon passing Pigeons and other  birds. It is most often seen following the coast-line during migrations  where it takes toll of Ducks and shore-birds. Three to four heavily  marked, brownish eggs are laid in April.      PIGEON HAWK    _Falco columbarius_              A small Hawk, about the size of a Sparrow Hawk.            The adult is slaty blue above, with a rusty collar            and a barred, white-tipped tail; below buff,            streaked with blackish. Young birds have the            upperparts blackish brown. L. 11.              _Range._ Breeds north of, and winters chiefly            south of the United States. Migrates northward in            April and May, and southward in September and            October.              Washington, not uncommon T.V. Ossining, tolerably  "]]]
