Such a motive  entitles the author to respect, and gives an additional value to the  book; while the talent with which it is written, renders it a narrative  of unusual interest. In nothing but its _theme_ is it like to any of  Cooper's novels. Its incidents and its characters are not similar, and  they lack truthfulness quite as much as they lack similarity. We know  something of Indian life; in our youth we saw much of it; and we regard  Cooper as its faithfulest delineator in literary art. The time at which  this romance opens is in the year 1600, when the wars between France and  England led to hostilities in Canada, and when an abortive attack was  made upon Quebec by the British and colonial army. The hero and heroine  are victims to the disasters of that war, and in describing their  adventures, Canada, and the condition of its civilized as well as of its  wild inhabitants, are vividly presented. The incidents justify the  author in making this appeal to his English readers when he reminds them  of the associations that should ever be connected with the fortress of  Quebec:--         \"Men of England, look not coldly upon the interests of that       land for the possession of which your fathers fought and bled.       Quench not irretrievably the flame of loyalty which burns in       many an earnest heart, loath to contract these new ties which       the progress of an irresistible destiny would seem to favor, at       the sacrifice of affection for the fatherland. The blood of the       greatest and wisest nation since the days of the Romans, flows       in the veins of the Anglo-Americans, unadulterated by the air       of another hemisphere, and stimulated into vigorous action by a       necessity for continual exertion, combined with an entire       liberty of thought which calls into play every resource of the       physical and intellectual man. The sturdy and intelligent race       that treads the virgin soil of Canada, can surely claim       equality, at the very least, with the denizens of older Europe;       cramped as they are for want of room, and enervated by an       ultra-civilization that wrongs nature, and has almost taken the       sceptre from her hand to put it into that of art. The British       colonist enjoys a peculiar exemption from those prejudices,       which, for so many ages, have retarded progress, and are       successively being overcome by the convictions of a more       enlightened era. There is a voice in the woods and mountains of       a great solitude that elevates the soul and fortifies it with       courage in the time of need. The great torrents and inland seas       of that noble country have schooled the generation, nurtured by       their side, into a strong conception of freedom, and the right       to be justly dealt with, at the hands of those with whom it is       connected by the double alliance of kindred predilection. A       pernicious, temporizing policy has of late caused such wounds       as may not be healed up very easily, we fear. The upright       colonist has seen an unprincipled faction permitted to ride       triumphant over those whose intentions are honest, and whose       loyalty is proven. Let us hope, that ere long something of the       chivalrous generosity of other days will pervade the councils       of the state, and rouse the stalwart spirit of the Briton to       scourge this ignominy from the land; if encouragement be due at       all, it surely is to those true-hearted provincials who are       avowedly proud of the great people from whence they derive       their character, their language, and their laws--and who are as       able, as they are willing, to preserve unto their beloved       Sovereign the colony their sires won.\"    This is tolerably good rhetoric, but it is not likely to have much  effect when the strong argument and imposing eloquence of statesmen have  failed to arrest attention. We see notices of another political novel  referring to Canada, which deals more directly, if with less talent,  with the disabilities and wishes of the people. It is entitled, _The  Footsteps of Montcalm_, and its hero, descended from a follower of the  brave Frenchman, contrasts with his ideal of freedom and happiness, the  laws, institutions, habits, and miseries, which he regards as  inseparable from the colonial relation. As in the rebellion of 1838,  whatever disaffection now prevails in British America, is probably  shared much less largely by the English than by the French population.  Political, religious, or sectarian novels, however, executed never so  cleverly, are but sugared pills at which the appetite revolts as soon as  the quality is discovered.          DR. WEBSTER, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW-YORK FREE ACADEMY.    [Illustration]      Throughout the world an extraordinary degree of attention has recently  been directed to systems and means of Education, and the truth has at  length been generally recognized that the stability and glory of nations  must depend upon the intelligence and virtue of their inhabitants. In  our own country, which is most of all interested in the diffusion of  knowledge, unexampled efforts are being made not only for the general  improvement of the culture offered in the seminaries, but for that  elevation of the laboring classes which, whatever may be said by  ambitious feeble-minds, seeking for reputation as reformers of the  social system, is really to be found only in a wise development of  individual capacities for the strife that has been and must be waged for  individual well-being.    There have been many improvements suggested or realized lately in  collegiate education. We have been gratified with Professor Sedgwick's  admirable treatise on the subject, which, at this time, is receiving in  England that consideration to which any thing from the mind of one so  distinguished is entitled. In this country we think no one, upon the  whole, has written more wisely than Dr. Wayland, whose views are to be  illustrated in the future government of the university over which he has  so long presided. But we shall not be satisfied until we have a great  institution, as much above the existing colleges as they are above the  common schools in the wards of the city, to which bachelors of arts only  shall be admitted, and to which they, whether coming from Harvard,  Oberlin, or Virginia, shall be admitted without charge.    The establishment of the NEW-YORK FREE ACADEMY is suggestive of many  things, and of this among them. We suppose a discussion whether our  colleges supply the _degree_ of education suitable to our general  condition, could be entertained only by dunces; the point whether they  furnish the kind and quality of culture to fit men for efficient and  just action, in such public affairs and private occupations as the  humblest may be called to in a free state, has been amply discussed, and  it is decided against the colleges.    Our schools, called colleges, have for the most part been fashioned  after the universities of Europe, but they have in all cases been  inadequately endowed, and without the internal police which is necessary  to their vigorous administration. Nine-tenths of the professors are  incompetent, and quite one half of them, in any thing worthy the name of  university could claim admission only to the class of freshmen; while  those who are capable of a reputable performance of their duties--so  uncertain are the revenues of the institutions to which they are  attached--are very frequently compelled to modify regulations and relax  discipline to such a degree that the colleges become only schools of  vice or nurseries of indolence.    The deficiency is of _authority_. It is useless to talk about courses of  study, or any thing else, until the discipline of the schools is as  absolute as that of the camp, the factory, or the counting-room. We are  inclined to believe that the usefulness of the Military Academy at West  Point,--which has furnished so large a proportion of the best civil  engineers, lawyers, physicians, and divines, as well as the soldiers who  and who _alone_ have conducted our armies to real glory,--we are  inclined to believe that this justly celebrated school owes all its  triumphs to its rigid laws and independence of popular clamor.    Discipline is every thing. Without it a man is but a fair model in wood,  which by it is turned to an engine of iron, and by opportunity furnished  with water and fire to impel it on a resistless course through the  world. And a man must be governed by others before he will govern  himself. The silliness about _liberty_ which is sometimes obtruded into  discussions of this subject, is fit for very young children and very old  women. There is no desirable liberty but in obedience. The cant about it  sometimes illustrates only a pitiable feebleness of intellect, but it  more frequently discloses some kind or degree of wilful licentiousness.  The \"voluntary system\" does very well in the churches. It will not do at  all in the colleges. St. Paul is always found even with the wisdom of  the age in which he is quoted, and he tells us that a youth \"differeth  nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors  and governors.\" This is the true philosophy. The \"sovereign\" people who  disregard law, and exult when it is outraged at the cost of an unpopular  party, have not learned what is necessary to freedom; they are not fit  for it; they will destroy its fairest fabrics, if the state does not  prepare its children by a thorough discipline for their inheritance. The  _way_ is by free schools and free colleges, supported by public taxes.  Sects and parties may have as many seminaries as they choose, and with  rules of study and conduct so easily to be complied with, and  administrations so "]]]
