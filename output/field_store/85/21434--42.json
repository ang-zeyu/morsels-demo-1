[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#6)"],[1," beautiful--but very imperfect; in many respects  ignorant, and yet radiant with a strong, childlike light of imagination,  which flames up under Constantine, illumines all the shores of the  Bosphorus and the Aegean and the Adriatic Sea, and then gradually, as the  people give themselves up to idolatry, becomes Corpse-light. The  architecture sinks into a settled form--a strange, gilded, and embalmed  repose: it, with the religion it expressed; and so would have remained  for ever,--so _does_ remain, where its languor has been undisturbed.[19]  But rough wakening was ordained for it.    Sec. XXI. This Christian art of the declining empire is divided into two  great branches, western and eastern; one centred at Rome, the other at  Byzantium, of which the one is the early Christian Romanesque, properly  so called, and the other, carried to higher imaginative perfection by  Greek workmen, is distinguished from it as Byzantine. But I wish the  reader, for the present, to class these two branches of art together in  his mind, they being, in points of main importance, the same; that is to  say, both of them a true continuance and sequence of the art of old Rome  itself, flowing uninterruptedly down from the fountain-head, and  entrusted always to the best workmen who could be found--Latins in Italy  and Greeks in Greece; and thus both branches may be ranged under the  general term of Christian Romanesque, an architecture which had lost the  refinement of Pagan art in the degradation of the empire, but which was  elevated by Christianity to higher aims, and by the fancy of the Greek  workmen endowed with brighter forms. And this art the reader may  conceive as extending in its various branches over all the central  provinces of the empire, taking aspects more or less refined, according  to its proximity to the seats of government; dependent for all its power  on the vigor and freshness of the religion which animated it; and as  that vigor and purity departed, losing its own vitality, and sinking  into nerveless rest, not deprived of its beauty, but benumbed and  incapable of advance or change.    Sec. XXII. Meantime there had been preparation for its renewal. While in  Rome and Constantinople, and in the districts under their immediate  influence, this Roman art of pure descent was practised in all its  refinement, an impure form of it--a patois of Romanesque--was carried by  inferior workmen into distant provinces; and still ruder imitations of  this patois were executed by the barbarous nations on the skirts of the  empire. But these barbarous nations were in the strength of their youth;  and while, in the centre of Europe, a refined and purely descended art  was sinking into graceful formalism, on its confines a barbarous and  borrowed art was organising itself into strength and consistency. The  reader must therefore consider the history of the work of the period as  broadly divided into two great heads: the one embracing the elaborately  languid succession of the Christian art of Rome; and the other, the  imitations of it executed by nations in every conceivable phase of early  organisation, on the edges of the empire, or included in its now merely  nominal extent.    Sec. XXIII. Some of the barbaric nations were, of course, not susceptible  of this influence; and when they burst over the Alps, appear, like the  Huns, as scourges only, or mix, as the Ostrogoths, with the enervated  Italians, and give physical strength to the mass with which they mingle,  without materially affecting its intellectual character. But others,  both south and north of the empire, had felt its influence, back to the  beach of the Indian Ocean on the one hand, and to the ice creeks of the  North Sea on the other. On the north and west the influence was of the  Latins; on the south and east, of the Greeks. Two nations, pre-eminent  above all the rest, represent to us the force of derived mind on either  side. As the central power is eclipsed, the orbs of reflected light  gather into their fulness; and when sensuality and idolatry had done  their work, and the religion of the empire was laid asleep in a  glittering sepulchre, the living light rose upon both horizons, and the  fierce swords of the Lombard and Arab were shaken over its golden  paralysis.    Sec. XXIV. The work of the Lombard was to give hardihood and system to  the enervated body and enfeebled mind of Christendom; that of the Arab  was to punish idolatry, and to proclaim the spirituality of worship.  The Lombard covered every church which he built with the sculptured  representations of bodily exercises--hunting and war.[20] The Arab  banished all imagination of creature form from his temples, and  proclaimed from their minarets, \"There is no god but God.\" Opposite in  their character and mission, alike in their magnificence of energy, they  came from the North and from the South, the glacier torrent and the lava  stream: they met and contended over the wreck of the Roman empire; and  the very centre of the struggle, the point of pause of both, the dead  water of the opposite eddies, charged with embayed fragments of the  Roman wreck, is VENICE.    The Ducal palace of Venice contains the three elements in exactly equal  proportions--the Roman, Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of  the world.    Sec. XXV. The reader will now begin to understand something of the  importance of the study of the edifices of a city which includes, within  the circuit of some seven or eight miles, the field of contest between  the three pre-eminent architectures of the world:--each architecture  expressing a condition of religion; each an erroneous condition, yet  necessary to the correction of the others, and corrected by them.    Sec. XXVI. It will be part of my endeavor, in the following work, to mark  the various modes in which the northern and southern architectures were  developed from the Roman: here I must pause only to name the  distinguishing characteristics of the great families. The Christian  Roman and Byzantine work is round-arched, with single and  well-proportioned shafts; capitals imitated from classical Roman;  mouldings more or less so; and large surfaces of walls entirely covered  with imagery, mosaic, and paintings, whether of scripture history or of  sacred symbols.    The Arab school is at first the same in its principal features, the  Byzantine workmen being employed by the caliphs; but the Arab rapidly  introduces characters half Persepolitan, half Egyptian, into the shafts  and capitals: in his intense love of excitement he points the arch and  writhes it into extravagant foliations; he banishes the animal imagery,  and invents an ornamentation of his own (called Arabesque) to replace  it: this not being adapted for covering large surfaces, he concentrates  it on features of interest, and bars his surfaces with horizontal lines  of color, the expression of the level of the Desert. He retains the  dome, and adds the minaret. All is done with exquisite refinement.    Sec. XXVII. The changes effected by the Lombard are more curious still,  for they are in the anatomy of the building, more than its decoration.  The Lombard architecture represents, as I said, the whole of that of  the northern barbaric nations. And this I believe was, at first, an  imitation in wood of the Christian Roman churches or basilicas. Without  staying to examine the whole structure of a basilica, the reader will  easily understand thus much of it: that it had a nave and two aisles,  the nave much higher than the aisles; that the nave was separated from  the aisles by rows of shafts, which supported, above, large spaces of  flat or dead wall, rising above the aisles, and forming the upper part  of the nave, now called the clerestory, which had a gabled wooden roof.    These high dead walls were, in Roman work, built of stone; but in the  wooden work of the North, they must necessarily have been made of  horizontal boards or timbers attached to uprights on the top of the nave  pillars, which were themselves also of wood.[21] Now, these uprights  were necessarily thicker than the rest of the timbers, and formed  vertical square pilasters above the nave piers. As Christianity extended  and civilisation increased, these wooden structures were changed into  stone; but they were literally petrified, retaining the form which had  been made necessary by their being of wood. The upright pilaster above  the nave pier remains in the stone edifice, and is the first form of the  great distinctive feature of Northern architecture--the vaulting shaft.  In that form the Lombards brought it into Italy, in the seventh century,  and it remains to this day in St. Ambrogio of Milan, and St. Michele of  Pavia.    Sec. XXVIII. When the vaulting shaft was introduced in the clerestory  walls, additional members were added for its support to the nave piers.  Perhaps two or three pine trunks, used for a single pillar, gave the  first idea of the grouped shaft. Be that as it may, the arrangement of  the nave pier in the form of a cross accompanies the superimposition of  the vaulting shaft; together with corresponding grouping of minor shafts  in doorways and apertures of windows. Thus, the whole body of the  Northern architecture, represented by that of the Lombards, may be  described as rough but majestic work, round-arched, with grouped shafts,  added vaulting shafts, and endless imagery of active life and fantastic  superstitions.    Sec. XXIX. The glacier stream of the Lombards, and the following one of  the Normans, left their erratic blocks, wherever they had flowed; but  without influencing, I think, the Southern nations beyond the sphere of  their own presence. But the lava stream of the Arab, even after it  ceased to flow, warmed the whole of the Northern air; and the history of  Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and  spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence. The noblest "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#6)"],[1," enrich them. For the execution of the rest  of the pulpit is studiously simple, and it is in this respect that its  design possesses, it seems to me, an interest to the religious spectator  greater than he will take in any other portion of the building. It is  supported, as I said, on a group of four slender shafts; itself of a  slightly oval form, extending nearly from one pillar of the nave to the  next, so as to give the preacher free room for the action of the entire  person, which always gives an unaffected impressiveness to the  eloquence of the southern nations. In the centre of its curved front, a  small bracket and detached shaft sustain the projection of a narrow  marble desk (occupying the place of a cushion in a modern pulpit), which  is hollowed out into a shallow curve on the upper surface, leaving a  ledge at the bottom of the slab, so that a book laid upon it, or rather  into it, settles itself there, opening as if by instinct, but without  the least chance of slipping to the side, or in any way moving beneath  the preacher's hands.[9] Six balls, or rather almonds, of purple marble  veined with white are set round the edge of the pulpit, and form its  only decoration. Perfectly graceful, but severe and almost cold in its  simplicity, built for permanence and service, so that no single member,  no stone of it, could be spared, and yet all are firm and uninjured as  when they were first set together, it stands in venerable contrast both  with the fantastic pulpits of mediaeval cathedrals and with the rich  furniture of those of our modern churches. It is worth while pausing for  a moment to consider how far the manner of decorating a pulpit may have  influence on the efficiency of its service, and whether our modern  treatment of this, to us all-important, feature of a church be the best  possible.    Sec. XIII. When the sermon is good we need not much concern ourselves  about the form of the pulpit. But sermons cannot always be good; and I  believe that the temper in which the congregation set themselves to  listen may be in some degree modified by their perception of fitness or  unfitness, impressiveness or vulgarity, in the disposition of the place  appointed for the speaker,--not to the same degree, but somewhat in the  same way, that they may be influenced by his own gestures or expression,  irrespective of the sense of what he says. I believe, therefore, in the  first place, that pulpits ought never to be highly decorated; the  speaker is apt to look mean or diminutive if the pulpit is either on a  very large scale or covered with splendid ornament, and if the interest  of the sermon should flag the mind is instantly tempted to wander. I  have observed that in almost all cathedrals, when the pulpits are  peculiarly magnificent, sermons are not often preached from them; but  rather, and especially if for any important purpose, from some temporary  erection in other parts of the building: and though this may often be  done because the architect has consulted the effect upon the eye more  than the convenience of the ear in the placing of his larger pulpit, I  think it also proceeds in some measure from a natural dislike in the  preacher to match himself with the magnificence of the rostrum, lest the  sermon should not be thought worthy of the place. Yet this will rather  hold of the colossal sculptures, and pyramids of fantastic tracery which  encumber the pulpits of Flemish and German churches, than of the  delicate mosaics and ivory-like carving of the Romanesque basilicas, for  when the form is kept simple, much loveliness of color and costliness of  work may be introduced, and yet the speaker not be thrown into the shade  by them.    Sec. XIV. But, in the second place, whatever ornaments we admit ought  clearly to be of a chaste, grave, and noble kind; and what furniture we  employ, evidently more for the honoring of God's word than for the ease  of the preacher. For there are two ways of regarding a sermon, either as  a human composition, or a Divine message. If we look upon it entirely as  the first, and require our clergymen to finish it with their utmost care  and learning, for our better delight whether of ear or intellect, we  shall necessarily be led to expect much formality and stateliness in its  delivery, and to think that all is not well if the pulpit have not a  golden fringe round it, and a goodly cushion in front of it, and if the  sermon be not fairly written in a black book, to be smoothed upon the  cushion in a majestic manner before beginning; all this we shall duly  come to expect: but we shall at the same time consider the treatise thus  prepared as something to which it is our duty to listen without  restlessness for half an hour or three quarters, but which, when that  duty has been decorously performed, we may dismiss from our minds in  happy confidence of being provided with another when next it shall be  necessary. But if once we begin to regard the preacher, whatever his  faults, as a man sent with a message to us, which it is a matter of life  or death whether we hear or refuse; if we look upon him as set in charge  over many spirits in danger of ruin, and having allowed to him but an  hour or two in the seven days to speak to them; if we make some endeavor  to conceive how precious these hours ought to be to him, a small vantage  on the side of God after his flock have been exposed for six days  together to the full weight of the world's temptation, and he has been  forced to watch the thorn and the thistle springing in their hearts, and  to see what wheat had been scattered there snatched from the wayside by  this wild bird and the other, and at last, when breathless and weary  with the week's labor they give him this interval of imperfect and  languid hearing, he has but thirty minutes to get at the separate hearts  of a thousand men, to convince them of all their weaknesses, to shame  them for all their sins, to warn them of all their dangers, to try by  this way and that to stir the hard fastenings of those doors where the  Master himself has stood and knocked yet none opened, and to call at the  openings of those dark streets where Wisdom herself hath stretched forth  her hands and no man regarded,--thirty minutes to raise the dead  in,--let us but once understand and feel this, and we shall look with  changed eyes upon that frippery of gay furniture about the place from  which the message of judgment must be delivered, which either breathes  upon the dry bones that they may live, or, if ineffectual, remains  recorded in condemnation, perhaps against the utterer and listener  alike, but assuredly against one of them. We shall not so easily bear  with the silk and gold upon the seat of judgment, nor with ornament of  oratory in the mouth of the messenger: we shall wish that his words may  be simple, even when they are sweetest, and the place from which he  speaks like a marble rock in the desert, about which the people have  gathered in their thirst.    Sec. XV. But the severity which is so marked in the pulpit at Torcello  is still more striking in the raised seats and episcopal throne which  occupy the curve of the apse. The arrangement at first somewhat recalls  to the mind that of the Roman amphitheatres; the flight of steps which  lead up to the central throne divides the curve of the continuous steps  or seats (it appears in the first three ranges questionable which were  intended, for they seem too high for the one, and too low and close for  the other), exactly as in an amphitheatre the stairs for access  intersect the sweeping ranges of seats. But in the very rudeness of this  arrangement, and especially in the want of all appliances of comfort  (for the whole is of marble, and the arms of the central throne are not  for convenience, but for distinction, and to separate it more  conspicuously from the undivided seats), there is a dignity which no  furniture of stalls nor carving of canopies ever could attain, and well  worth the contemplation of the Protestant, both as sternly significative  of an episcopal authority which in the early days of the Church was  never disputed, and as dependent for all its impressiveness on the utter  absence of any expression either of pride or self-indulgence.    Sec. XVI. But there is one more circumstance which we ought to remember as  giving peculiar significance to the position which the episcopal throne  occupies in this island church, namely, that in the minds of all early  Christians the Church itself was most frequently symbolized under the  image of a ship, of which the bishop was the pilot. Consider the force  which this symbol would assume in the imaginations of men to whom the  spiritual Church had become an ark of refuge in the midst of a  destruction hardly less terrible than that from which the eight souls  were saved of old, a destruction in which the wrath of man had become as  broad as the earth and as merciless as the sea, and who saw the actual  and literal edifice of the Church raised up, itself like an ark in the  midst of the waters. No marvel if with the surf of the Adriatic rolling  between them and the shores of their birth, from which they were  separated for ever, they should have looked upon each other as the  disciples did when the storm came down on the Tiberias Lake, and have  yielded ready and loving obedience to those who ruled them in His name,  who had there rebuked the winds and commanded stillness to the sea. And  if the stranger would yet learn in what spirit it was that the dominion  of Venice was begun, and in what strength she went forth conquering and  to conquer, let him not seek to estimate the wealth of her arsenals or  number of her armies, nor look upon the pageantry of her palaces, nor  enter into the secrets of her councils; but let him ascend the highest  tier of the stern ledges that sweep round the altar of Torcello, and  then, looking as the pilot did of old"]]]
