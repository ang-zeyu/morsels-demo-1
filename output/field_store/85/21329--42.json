After a few minutes he suddenly ceased, and started  off full speed for a higher part of the stream. Mr. Davy was able to  keep him in view, and he did not stop till he came to a spot where a  plank connected the banks, on which he crossed dry-footed, and soon  joined his companions.    Dogs have sometimes strange fancies with respect to moving from one  place to another. A Fellow of a College at Cambridge had a dog, which  sometimes took it into his head to visit his master's usual places of  resort in London. He would then return to his home in Suffolk, and  then go to Cambridge, remaining at each place as long as he felt  disposed to do so, and going and returning with the most perfect  indifference and complacency.    The extraordinary sense of a dog was shown in the following instance.  A gentleman, residing near Pontypool, had his horse brought to his  house by a servant. While the man went to the door, the horse ran away  and made his escape to a neighbouring mountain. A dog belonging to the  house saw this, and of his own accord followed the horse, got hold of  the bridle and brought him back to the door.    I have been informed of two instances of dogs having slipped their  collars and put their heads into them again of their own accord, after  having committed depredations in the night, and I have elsewhere  mentioned the fact of a dog, now in my possession, who undid the  collar of another dog chained to a kennel near him. These are curious  instances of sense and sagacity.    Mr. Bell, in his \"History of British Quadrupeds,\" gives us the  following fact of a dog belonging to a friend of his. This gentleman  dropped a louis d'or one morning, when he was on the point of leaving  his house. On returning late at night, he was told by his servant that  the dog had fallen sick, and refused to eat, and, what appeared very  strange, she would not suffer him to take her food away from before  her, but had been lying with her nose close to the vessel, without  attempting to touch it. On Mr. Bell's friend entering the room, the  dog instantly jumped upon him, laid the money at his feet, and began  to devour her victuals with great voracity.    It is a curious fact that dogs can count time. I had, when a boy, a  favourite terrier, which always went with me to church. My mother,  thinking that he attracted too much of my attention, ordered the  servant to fasten him up every Sunday morning. He did so once or  twice, but never afterwards. Trim concealed himself every Sunday  morning, and either met me as I entered the church, or I found him  under my seat in the pew. Mr. Southey, in his \"Omniana,\" informs us  that he knew of a dog, which was brought up by a Catholic and  afterwards sold to a Protestant, but still he refused to eat anything  on a Friday.    Dogs have been known to die from excess of joy at seeing their masters  after a long absence. An English officer had a large dog, which he  left with his family in England, while he accompanied an expedition to  America during the war of the Colonies. Throughout his absence, the  animal appeared very much dejected. When the officer returned home,  the dog, who happened to be lying at the door of an apartment into  which his master was about to enter, immediately recognised him, leapt  upon his neck, licked his face, and in a few minutes fell dead at his  feet. A favourite spaniel of a lady recently died on seeing his  beloved mistress after a long absence.    A gentleman who had a dog of a most endearing disposition, was obliged  to go a journey periodically once a-month. His stay was short, and  his departure and return very regular, and without variation. The dog  always grew uneasy when he first lost his master, and moped in a  corner, but recovered himself gradually as the time for his return  approached; which he knew to an hour, nay, to a minute. When he was  convinced that his master was on the road, at no great distance from  home, he flew all over the house; and if the street door happened to  be shut, he would suffer no servant to have any rest until it was  opened. The moment he obtained his freedom away he went, and to a  certainty met his benefactor about two miles from town. He played and  frolicked about him till he had obtained one of his gloves, with which  he ran or rather flew home, entered the house, laid it down in the  middle of the room, and danced round it. When he had sufficiently  amused himself in this manner, out of the house he flew, returned to  meet his master, and ran before him, or gambolled by his side, till he  arrived with him at home. \"I know not (says Mr. Dibdin, who relates  this anecdote), how frequently this was repeated; but it lasted till  the old gentleman grew infirm, and incapable of continuing his  journeys. The dog by this time was also grown old, and became at  length blind; but this misfortune did not hinder him from fondling his  master, whom he knew from every other person, and for whom his  affection and solicitude rather increased than diminished. The old  gentleman, after a short illness, died. The dog knew the  circumstance, watched the corpse, blind as he was, and did his utmost  to prevent the undertaker from screwing up the body in the coffin, and  most outrageously opposed its being taken out of the house. Being past  hope, he grew disconsolate, lost his flesh, and was evidently verging  towards his end. One day he heard a gentleman come into the house, and  he ran to meet him. His master being old and infirm, wore ribbed  stockings for warmth. The gentleman had stockings on of the same kind.  The dog perceived it, and thought it was his master, and began to  exhibit the most extravagant signs of pleasure; but upon further  examination finding his mistake, he retired into a corner, where in a  short time he expired.\"    Some dogs are so faithful that they will never quit a thing entrusted  to their charge, and will defend it to the utmost of their power. This  may be often observed in the case of a cur, lying on the coat of a  labourer while he is at work in the fields, and in those of carriers'  and bakers' dogs. An instance is on record of a chimney-sweeper having  placed his soot-bag in the street under the care of his dog, who  suffered a cart to drive over and crush him to death, sooner than  abandon his charge. Colonel Hamilton Smith, in the \"Cyclopaedia of  Natural History,\" mentions a curious instance of fidelity and sagacity  in a dog. He informs us that \"in the neighbourhood of Cupar, in the  county of Fife, there lived two dogs, mortal enemies to each other,  and who always fought desperately whenever they met. Capt. R---- was  the master of one of them, and the other belonged to a neighbouring  farmer. Capt. R----'s dog was in the practice of going messages, and  even of bringing butchers' meat and other articles from Cupar. One  day, while returning charged with a basket containing some pieces of  mutton, he was attacked by some of the curs of the town, who, no  doubt, thought the prize worth contending for. The assault was fierce,  and of some duration; but the messenger, after doing his utmost, was  at last overpowered and compelled to yield up the basket, though not  before he had secured a part of its contents. The piece saved from the  wreck he ran off with, at full speed, to the quarters of his old  enemy, at whose feet he laid it down, stretching himself beside it  till he had eaten it up. A few snuffs, a few whispers in the ear, and  other dog-like courtesies, were then exchanged; after which they both  set off together for Cupar, where they worried almost every dog in the  town; and, what is more remarkable, they never afterwards quarrelled,  but were always on friendly terms.\"    That society and culture soften and moderate the passions of dogs  cannot be doubted, and they constantly imbibe feelings from those of  their master. Thus, if he is a coward, his dog is generally found to  be one. Dogs are, however, in many respects, rational beings; and some  proofs of this will be given in the present work. They will watch the  countenance of their master--they will understand words, which,  though addressed to others, they will apply to themselves, and act  accordingly. Thus a dog, which, from its mangy state, was ordered to  be destroyed, took the first opportunity of quitting the ship, and  would never afterwards come near a sailor belonging to it. If I desire  the servant to wash a little terrier, who is apparently asleep at my  feet, he will quit the room, and hide himself for some hours. A dog,  though pressed with hunger, will never seize a piece of meat in  presence of his master, though with his eyes, his movements, and his  voice, he will make the most humble and expressive petition. Is not  this reasoning?    But there is one faculty in the dog which would appear perfectly  incomprehensible. It is the sense of smelling. He will not only scent  various kinds of game at considerable distances, but he has been known  to trace the odour of his master's feet through all the winding  streets of a populous city. This extreme sensibility is very  wonderful. It would thus appear that the feelings of dogs are more  exquisite than our own. They have sensations, but their faculty of  comparing them, or of forming ideas, is much circumscribed. A dog can  imitate some human actions, and is capable of receiving a certain  degree of instruction; but his progress soon stops. It is, however, an  animal that should always be loved and treated with kindness. It is a  curious fact, that dogs who have had their ears and tails cut for  many generations, transmit these defects to their descendants.  Drovers' dogs, which may always be seen with short tails, are a proof  of this.    A pleasing character of the dog is given in Smellie's \"Philosophy of  Natural History.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#6)"],[1," that, despite the asserted careful  comparison of events with the planetary positions preceding and  indicating them, nothing was ever observed which seemed to suggest the  possibility that there may be an unknown planet ruling very strongly the  affairs of men. Astrologers tell us now that Uranus is a very potent  planet; yet the old astrologers seem to have got on very well without  him. By the way, one of the moderns, the grave Raphael, gives a very  singular account of the discovery of Uranus, in a book published sixteen  years before Neptune was discovered by just such a process as Raphael  imagined in the case of Uranus. He says that Drs. Halley, Bradley, and  others, having frequently observed that Saturn was disturbed in his  motion by some force exerted from beyond his orbit, and being unable to  account for the disturbance on the known principles of gravitation,  pursued their enquiry into the matter, 'till at length the discovery of  this hitherto unknown planet covered their labours with success, and has  enabled us to enlarge our present solar system to nearly double its  bounds.' Of course there is not a word of truth in this; Uranus having  been discovered by accident long after Halley and Bradley were in the  grave. But the account suggests what might have been, and curiously  anticipates the actual manner in which Neptune was discovered.    Astrologers agree in attributing evil effects to Uranus. But the evil he  does is always peculiarly strange, unaccountable, and totally  unexpected. He causes the native born under his influence to be of a  very eccentric and original disposition, romantic, unsettled, addicted  to change, a seeker after novelty; though, if the moon or Mercury have a  good aspect towards Uranus, the native will be profound in the secret  sciences, magnanimous, and lofty of mind. But let all beware of marriage  when Uranus is in the seventh house, or afflicting the moon. And in  general, let the fair sex remember that Uranus is peculiarly hostile to  them, and very evil in love.    Saturn is the Greater Infortune of the old system of astrology, and is  by universal experience acknowledged to be the most potent, evil, and  malignant of all the planets. Those born under him are of dark and pale  complexion, with small, black, leering eyes, thick lips and nostrils,  large ears, thin face, lowering looks, cloudy aspect, and seemingly  melancholy and unhappy; and though they have broad shoulders, they have  but short lips and a thin beard, They are in character austere and  reserved, covetous, laborious, and revengeful; constant in friendship,  and good haters. The most remarkable and certain characteristic of the  Saturnine man is that, as an old author observes 'he will never look  thee in the face.' 'If they have to love any one, these Saturnines,'  says another old author, 'they love most constantly; and if they hate,  they hate to the death.' The persons signified symbolically by Saturn  are grandparents, and other old persons, day labourers, paupers,  beggars, clowns, husbandmen of the meaner sort, and especially  undertakers, sextons, and gravediggers. Chaucer thus presents the chief  effects which Saturn produces in the fortunes of men and nations--Saturn  himself being the speaker:--              ... quod Saturne    My cours, that hath so wide for to turne,    Hath more power than wot any man.    Min is the drenching in the sea so wan,    Min is the prison in the derke cote,    Min is the strangel and hanging by the throte,    The murmure and the cherles rebelling,    The groyning, and the prive empoysoning,    I do vengaunce and pleine correction,    While I dwell in the signe of the leon;    Min is the ruine of the high halles,    The falling of the toures and of the walles    Upon the minour or the carpenter:    I slew Sampson in shaking the piler.    Min ben also the maladies colde,    The derke tresons, and the castes olde:    My loking is the fader of pestilence.    Jupiter, on the contrary, though Saturn's next neighbour in the solar  system, produces effects of an entirely contrary kind. He is, in fact,  the most propitious of all the planets, and the native born under his  influence has every reason to be jovial in fact as he is by nature. Such  a native will be tall and fair, handsome and erect, robust, ruddy, and  altogether a good-looking person, whether male or female. The native  will also be religious, or at least a good moral honest man, unless  Jupiter be afflicted by the aspects of Saturn, Mars, or Uranus; in which  case he may still be a jolly fellow, no man's enemy but his own--only he  will probably be his own enemy to a very considerable extent,  squandering his means and ruining his health by gluttony and  intoxication. The persons represented by Jupiter (when he is not  afflicted) are judges, counsellors, church dignitaries, from cardinals  to curates, scholars, chancellors, barristers, and the highest orders of  lawyers, woollendrapers (possibly there may be some astral significance  in the woolsack), and clothiers. When Jupiter is afflicted, however, he  denotes quacks and mountebanks, knaves, cheats, and drunkards. The  influence of the planet on the fortunes is nearly always good.  Astrologers, who to a man reverence dignities, consider Great Britain  fortunate in that the lady whom, with customary effusion, they term 'Our  Most Gracious Queen,' was born when Jupiter was riding high in the  heavens near his culmination, this position promising a most fortunate  and happy career. The time has passed when the fortunes of this country  were likely to be affected by such things; but we may hope, for the  lady's own sake, that this prediction has been fulfilled. Astrologers  assert the same about the Duke of Wellington, assigning midnight, May 1,  1769, as the hour of his birth. There is some doubt both as to the date  and place of the great soldier's birth; but the astrologer finds in the  facts of his life the means of removing all such doubts.[11]    Next in order comes Mars, inferior only in malefic influence to Saturn,  and called by the old astrologers the Lesser Infortune. The native born  under the influence of Mars is usually of fierce countenance, his eyes  sparkling, or sharp and darting, his complexion fiery or yellowish, and  his countenance scarred or furrowed. His hair is reddish or sandy,  unless Mars chances to be in a watery sign, in which case the hair will  be flaxen; or in an earthly sign, in which case the hair will be  chestnut. The Martialist is broad-shouldered, steady, and strong, but  short,[12] and often bony and lean. In character the Martialist is fiery  and choleric, naturally delighting in war and contention, but generous  and magnanimous. This when Mars is well aspected; should the planet be  evil aspected, then will the native be treacherous, thievish,  treasonable, cruel, and wicked. The persons signified by Mars are  generals, soldiers, sailors (if he is in a watery sign), surgeons,  chemists, doctors, armourers, barbers, curriers, smiths, carpenters,  bricklayers, sculptors, cooks, and tailors. When afflicted with Mercury  or the moon, he denotes thieves, hangmen, and 'all cut throat people.'  In fact, except the ploughboy, who belongs to Saturn, all the members of  the old septet, 'tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, apothecary, ploughboy,  thief,' are favourites with Mars. The planet's influence is not quite so  evil as Saturn's, nor are the effects produced by it so long-lasting.  'The influence of Saturn,' says an astrologer, 'may be compared to a  lingering but fatal consumption; that of Mars to a burning fever.' He is  the cause of anger, quarrels, violence, war, and slaughter.    The sun comes next; for it must be remembered that, according to the old  system of astronomy, the sun was a planet. Persons born under the sun as  the planet ruling their ascendant, would be more apt to be aware of the  fact than Saturnine, Jovial, Martial, or any other folk, because the  hour of birth, if remembered, at once determines whether the native is a  solar subject or not. The solar native has generally a round face (like  pictures of the sun in old books of astronomy), with a short chin; his  complexion somewhat sanguine; curling sandy hair, and a white tender  skin. As to character, he is bold and resolute, desirous of praise, of  slow speech and composed judgment; outwardly decorous, but privately not  altogether virtuous. The sun, in fact, according to astrologers, is the  natural significator of respectability; for which I can discover no  reason, unless it be that the sun travelling always in the ecliptic has  no latitude, and so solar folk are allowed none. When the sun is ill  aspected, the native is both proud and mean, tyrannical and sycophantic,  exceedingly unamiable, and generally disliked because of his arrogance  and ignorant pomposity. The persons signified by the sun are emperors,  kings, and titled folk generally, goldsmiths, jewellers, and coiners.  When 'afflicted,' the sun signifies pretenders either to power or  knowledge. The sun's influence is not in itself either good or evil, but  is most powerful for good when he is favourably aspected, and for evil  when he is afflicted by other planets.    Venus, the next in order, bore the same relation to the Greater Fortune  Jupiter which Mars bore to Saturn the Greater Ill-fortune. She was the  Lesser Fortune, and her influence was in nearly all respects benevolent.  The persons born under the influence of this planet are handsome, with  beautiful sparkling hazel or black eyes (but another authority assigns  the subject of Venus, 'a full eye, usually we say goggle-eyed,' by which  we do not usually imply beauty), ruddy lips, the upper lip short, soft  smooth hair, dimples in the cheek and chin, an amorous look and a sweet  voice. One old astrologer puts the matter thus pleasantly:--'The native  of Venus hath,' quoth he, 'a love-dimple in the chin, a"]]]
