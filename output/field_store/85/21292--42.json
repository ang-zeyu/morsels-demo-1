Slain on the battlefield lay Assistant-Commandant J. C. Bodenstein and  Major Hall, of the Johannesburg Town Council, two of my bravest  officers, whose loss I still regret.    We rode on slowly, and all along the road we fell in with groups of  burghers. There was no question that our ranks were demoralised and  heartsick. Commandant-General Joubert had made Dannhauser Station his  headquarters and thither we wended our way. But though we approached  our general with hearts weighed down with sorrow, so strange and  complex a character is the Boers', that by the time we reached him we  had gathered together 120 stragglers, and had recovered our spirits  and our courage. I enjoyed a most refreshing rest on an unoccupied  farm and sent a messenger to Joubert asking him for an appointment for  the following morning to hand in my report of the ill-fated battle.  The messenger, however, brought back a verbal answer that the General  was exceedingly angry and had sent no reply. On retiring that night I  found my left leg injured in several places by splinters of shell and  stone. My garments had to be soaked in water to remove them, but after  I had carefully cleaned my wounds they very soon healed.    The next morning I waited on the Commandant-General. He received me  very coldly, and before I could venture a word said reproachfully:  \"Why didn't you obey orders and stop this side of the Biggarsbergen,  as the Council of War decided you should do?\" He followed up the  reproach with a series of questions: \"Where's your general?\" \"How many  men have you lost?\" \"How many English have you killed?\" I said  deferentially: \"Well, General, you know I am not to be bullied like  this. You know you placed me in a subordinate position under the  command of General Kock, and now you lay all the blame for yesterday's  disaster on my shoulders. However, I am sorry to say General Kock is  wounded and in British hands. I don't know how many men we have lost;  I suppose about 30 or 40 killed and approximately 100 wounded. The  British must have lost considerably more, but I am not making any  estimate.\"    The grey-bearded generalissimo cooled a little and spoke more kindly,  although he gave me to understand he did not think much of the  Johannesburg commando. I replied that they had been fighting very  pluckily, and that by retiring they hoped to retrieve their fortunes  some other day. \"H'm,\" returned the General, \"some of your burghers  have made so masterly a retreat that they have already got to  Newcastle, and I have just wired Field-Cornet Pienaar, who is in  charge, that I should suggest to him to wait a little there, as I  propose sending him some railway carriages to enable him to retreat  still further. As for those Germans and Hollanders with you, they may  go to Johannesburg; I won't have them here any more.\"    \"General,\" I protested, \"this is not quite fair. These people have  volunteered to fight for, and with us; we cannot blame them in this  matter. It is most unfortunate that Elandslaagte should have been  lost, but as far as I can see there was no help for it.\" The old  General appeared lost in thought; he seemed to take but little notice  of what I said. Finally he looked up and fixed his small glittering  eyes upon me as if he wished to read my most inmost thoughts.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know all about that. At Dundee things have gone  just as badly. Lukas Meyer made a feeble attack, and Erasmus left him  in the lurch. The two were to charge simultaneously, but Erasmus  failed him at a critical moment, which means a loss of 130 men killed  and wounded, and Lukas Meyer in retreat across the Buffalo River. And  now Elandslaagte on the top of all! All this owing to the disobedience  and negligence of my chief officers.\"    The old man spoke in this strain for some time, until I grew tired and  left. But just as I was on the point of proceeding from his tent, he  said: \"Look here, Commandant, reorganise your commando as quickly as  you can, and report to me as soon as you are ready.\" He also gave me  permission to incorporate in the reorganised commando various  Hollander and German stragglers who were loafing round about, although  he seemed to entertain an irradicable prejudice against the Dutch and  German corps.    The Commandant of the Hollander corps, Volksraad Member Lombard, came  out of the battle unscathed; his captain, Mr. B. J. Verselewel de Witt  Hamer, had been made a prisoner; the Commandant of the German corps,  Captain A. Schiel, fell wounded into British hands, while among the  officers who were killed in action I should mention Dr. H. J. Coster,  the bravest Hollander the Transvaal ever saw, the most brilliant  member of the Pretoria Bar, who laid down his life because in a stupid  moment Kruger had taunted him and his compatriots with cowardice.          CHAPTER VI.    RISKING JOUBERT'S ANGER.      After the above unpleasant but fairly successful interview with our  Commander-in-Chief, I left the men I had gathered round me in charge  of a field-cornet, and proceeded by train to Newcastle to collect the  scattered remnants of my burghers, and to obtain mules and waggons for  my convoy. For, as I have previously stated, it was at Newcastle we  had left all our commissariat-waggons and draught cattle under a  strong escort. On arrival I summoned the burghers together, and  addressing them in a few words, pointed out that we should, so soon as  possible, resume the march, in order to reach the fighting line  without delay, and there retrieve the pride and honour of our  commando.    \"Our beloved country,\" I said, \"as well as our dead, wounded and  missing comrades, require us not to lose courage at this first  reverse, but to continue the righteous struggle even against  overwhelming odds,\" and so on, in this strain.    I honestly cannot understand why we should have been charged with  cowardice at the battle of Elandslaagte, although many of us seemed to  apprehend that this would be the case. We had made a good fight of it,  but overwhelmed by an organised force of disciplined men, eight or ten  times our number, we had been vanquished, and the British were the  first to admit that we had manfully and honourably defended our  positions. To put a wrong construction on our defeat was a libel on  all who had bravely fought the fight, and I resented it. There are  such things as the fortunes of war, and as only one side can win, it  cannot always be the same. However, I soon discovered that a small  number of our burghers did not seem inclined to join in the  prolongation of the struggle. To have forced them to rejoin us would  have served no purpose, so I thought the best policy would be to send  them home on furlough until they had recovered their spirits and  their courage. No doubt the scorn and derision to which they would be  subjected by their wives and sisters would soon induce them to take up  arms again and to fulfil the duties their country required. I  therefore requested those who had neither the courage nor the  inclination to return to the front to fall out, and about thirty men  fell back, bowing their heads in shame. They were jeered at and  chaffed by their fellows, the majority of whom had elected to proceed.  But the shock of Elandslaagte had been too much for the weaker  brethren, who seemed deaf to every argument, and only wanted to go  home. I gave each of these a pass to proceed by rail to Johannesburg,  which read as follows:--         \"Permit..................................... to go to       Johannesburg on account of cowardice, at Government's       expense.\"    They put the permit in their pockets without suspecting its contents,  and departed with their kit to the station to catch the first  available train.    The reader will now have formed an idea of the disastrous moral effect  of this defeat, and the subsequent difficulty of getting a commando up  to its original fighting strength. But in spite of this I am proud to  say that by far the greater number of the Johannesburgers were  gathered round me and prepared to march to meet the enemy once more.    My trap and all its contents had been captured by the enemy at  Elandslaagte, and I found it necessary to obtain new outfits, &c., at  Newcastle. This was no easy matter, as some of the storekeepers had  moved the greater part of their goods to a safer place, while some  commandos had appropriated most of the remainder. What was left had  been commandeered by Mr. J. Moodie, a favourite of General Joubert,  who was posing there as Resident Justice of the Peace; and he did not  feel inclined to let any of these goods out of his possession. By  alternately buying and looting, or in other words stealing, I managed  to get an outfit by the next morning, and at break of day we left for  Dannhauser Station, arriving there the same evening without further  noteworthy incident.    Next day, when the Johannesburg corps turned out, we numbered 485  mounted men, all fully equipped. On arrival at Glencoe Station I  received a telegram from General Joubert informing me that he had  defeated the enemy at Nicholson's Nek near Ladysmith that day (October  30, 1899) taking 1,300 prisoners, who would arrive at Glencoe the  following morning. He desired me to conduct them to Pretoria under a  strong escort. What a flattering order! To conduct prisoners-of-war,  taken by other burghers! Were we then fit for nothing but police duty?    However, orders have to be obeyed, so I sent one of my officers with  40 men to take the prisoners to Pretoria, and reported to the  Commandant-General by telegram that his order had been executed, also  asking for instructions as to where I was to proceed with my commando.  The reply I received was as follows:--    \"Pitch your camp near Dundee, and maintain law and order in the  Province, also aid the Justice of the Peace in forwarding captured "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],[0,"The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#6)"],[1,"Budge_, and the rest of the Gang, at the Table, with Wine,    Brandy and Tobacco.    _Ben._ But pr'ythee, _Matt_, what is become of thy Brother _Tom_? I have  not seen him since my Return from Transportation.    _Matt._ Poor Brother _Tom_ had an Accident this time Twelve-month, and  so clever a made fellow he was, that I could not save him from those  fleaing Rascals the Surgeons; and now, poor Man, he is among the Otamys  at _Surgeons Hall_.    _Ben._ So it seems, his Time was come.    _Jemmy._ But the present Time is ours, and no body alive hath more.

The World is  avaritious, and I hate Avarice. A covetous fellow, like a Jackdaw,  steals what he was never made to enjoy, for the sake of hiding it. These  are the Robbers of Mankind, for Money was made for the Free-hearted and  Generous, and where is the Injury of taking from another, what he hath  not the Heart to make use of?    _Jemmy._ Our several Stations for the Day are fixt.

Am I to have the  Honour of taking the Air with you, Sir, this Evening upon the Heath?  I drink a Dram now and then with the Stagecoachmen in the way of  Friendship and Intelligence; and I know that about this Time there will  be Passengers upon the Western Road, who are worth speaking with.    _Macheath._ I was to have been of that Party-- but--    _Matt._ But what, Sir?    _Macheath._ Is there any Man who suspects my Courage?    _Matt._ We have all been Witnesses of it.    _Macheath._ My Honour and Truth to the Gang?    _Matt._ I'll be answerable for it.    _Macheath._ In the Division of our Booty, have I ever shewn the least  Marks of Avarice or Injustice?    _Matt._ By these Questions something seems to have ruffled you. Are any  of us suspected?    _Macheath._ I have a fixed Confidence, Gentlemen, in you all, as Men of  Honour, and as such I value and respect you. _Peachum_ is a Man that is  useful to us.    _Matt._ Is he about to play us any foul Play? I'll shoot him through the  Head.    _Macheath._ I beg you, Gentlemen, act with Conduct and Discretion.  A Pistol is your last Resort.    _Matt._ He knows nothing of this Meeting.    _Macheath._ Business cannot go on without him. He is a Man who knows the  World, and is a necessary Agent to us. We have had a slight Difference,  and 'till it is accommodated I shall be oblig'd to keep out of his way.  Any private Dispute of mine shall be of no ill consequence to my  Friends. You must continue to act under his Direction, for the moment we  break loose from him, our Gang is ruin'd.    _Matt._ As a Bawd to a Whore, I grant you, he is to us of great  Convenience.    _Macheath._ Make him believe I have quitted the Gang, which I can never  do but with Life. At our private Quarters I will continue to meet you.  A Week or so will probably reconcile us.    _Matt._ Your Instructions shall be observ'd. 'Tis now high time for us  to repair to our several Duties; so 'till the Evening at our Quarters in  Moor-Fields we bid you farewel.    _Macheath._ I shall wish myself with you.

Money is  not so strong a Cordial for the Time. Drawer-- [Enter Drawer.] Is the  Porter gone for all the Ladies according to my Directions?    _Drawer._ I expect him back every Minute. But you know, Sir, you sent  him as far as _Hockley in the Hole_ for three of the Ladies, for one in  _Vinegar-Yard_, and for the rest of them somewhere about  _Lewkner's-Lane_. Sure some of them are below, for I hear the Bar-Bell.  As they come I will shew them up. Coming, Coming.      Enter Mrs. _Coaxer_, _Dolly Trull_, Mrs. _Vixen_, _Betty Doxy_, _Jenny  Diver_, Mrs. _Slammekin_, _Suky Tawdry_, and _Molly Brazen_.    _Macheath._ Dear Mrs. _Coaxer_, you are welcome. You look charmingly  to-day. I hope you don't want the Repairs of Quality, and lay on Paint.  --_Dolly Trull!_ kiss me, you Slut; are you as amorous as ever, Hussy?  You are always so taken up with stealing Hearts, that you don't allow  yourself Time to steal any thing else. --Ah _Dolly_, thou wilt ever be a  Coquette! Mrs. _Vixen_, I'm yours, I always lov'd a Woman of Wit and  Spirit; they make charming Mistresses, but plaguy Wives-- _Betty Doxy!_  Come hither, Hussy. Do you drink as hard as ever? You had better stick  to good wholesom Beer; for in troth, _Betty_, Strong-Waters will in time  ruin your Constitution. You should leave those to your Betters. --What!  and my pretty _Jenny Diver_ too! As prim and demure as ever! There is  not any Prude, though ever so high bred, hath a more sanctify'd Look,  with a more mischievous Heart. Ah! thou art a dear artful Hypocrite.  --Mrs. _Slammekin!_ as careless and genteel as ever! all you fine  Ladies, who know your own Beauty, affect an Undress. --But see, here's  _Suky Tawdry_ come to contradict what I was saying. Every thing she gets  one way she lays out upon her Back. Why, _Suky_, you must keep at least  a Dozen Tallymen. _Molly Brazen!_ [She kisses him.] That's well done.  I love a free-hearted Wench. Thou hast a most agreeable Assurance, Girl,  and art as willing as a Turtle. --But hark! I hear Music. The Harper is  at the Door. _If Music be the Food of Love, play on._ Ere you seat  yourselves, Ladies, what think you of a Dance? Come in. [Enter Harper.]  Play the _French_ Tune, that Mrs. _Slammekin_ was so fond of.        [A Dance _a la ronde_ in the _French_ manner; near the end of it      this song and Chorus.      AIR XXII.

[Exit Harper.] If any of the  Ladies choose Ginn, I hope they will be so free to call for it.    _Jenny._ You look as if you meant me. Wine is strong enough for me.  Indeed, Sir, I never drink Strong-Waters, but when I have the Cholic.    _Macheath._ Just the Excuse of the fine Ladies! Why, a Lady of Quality  is never without the Cholic. I hope, Mrs. _Coaxer_, you have had good  Success of late in your Visits among the Mercers.    _Mrs. Coaxer._ We have so many Interlopers-- Yet with Industry, one may  still have a little Picking.

She rivetted a Linen-Draper's Eye so fast upon her, that he was nick'd  of three Pieces of Cambric before he could look off.    _Brazen._ Oh dear Madam! --But sure nothing can come up to your handling  of Laces! And then you have such a sweet deluding Tongue!
