He reported  knowledge of \"two or three\" that had been trapped in the county and  further noted a report that red foxes were \"not rare along the Lone  Pines.\" Visher's paper evidently was overlooked by Hall and Kelson  (1959: map 447), who did not include the western half of South Dakota  within the distribution of the species. The only foxes observed by our  field parties were two seen in July of 1970--one an immature animal held  captive in Camp Crook and remains of another that had been killed on a  county road about 18 miles north of that place. Five specimens that had  been killed by hunters were acquired in March 1963 and an isolated skull  was picked up west of Camp Crook in 1970.    There is a continuing demand from sheep ranchers in the county that  foxes be controlled, yet this species seems to maintain considerably  higher populations than does the coyote. According to federal trapper  Robert Kriege (personal communication), dens of the red fox have been  found principally in the badlands and in certain grassland areas, but  rarely in the buttes proper. Records kept by Mr. Kriege indicate that  litters are born in mid-March in Harding County. He estimated that over  the past few years he has examined whelps from an average of 50 dens a  year, but that more than 170 dens were found in the spring of 1963.      ~Ursus americanus americanus~ Pallas, 1780    Black Bear    Visher (1914:91) reported that a black bear \"was seen near the Cave  Hills in July, 1910.\" He further noted: \"Bears have been recently killed  in the Long Pine and Ekalaka forests [of adjacent Montana], but their  day of extermination is here near at hand.\" We know of no other reports  of this carnivore from the area.      ~Ursus arctos horribilis~ Ord, 1815    Grizzly Bear    According to Visher (1914:91) a grizzly bear was killed in the early  1890's a short distance southwest of Camp Crook.      ~Procyon lotor hirtus~ Nelson and Goldman, 1930    Raccoon    _Specimens examined_ (10).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 4; 1/2 mi. W Reva,  1; 4 mi. E Reva, 2; NW 1/4 sec. 32, R. 1 E, T. 20 N, 3.    The raccoon evidently is one of the commonest carnivores in Harding  County. On June 24, 1961, a den with three young (average total length,  429) was found in one of the numerous pockets eroded from the caprock of  the North Cave Hills, and on May 21, 1968, another den, this one  containing five young (average total length of three, 271), was found in  a similar situation on the east edge of the Long Pine Hills. A female  trapped on June 20, 1961, was lactating.    Three individuals that had been killed at Ralph, along nearly treeless  Big Nasty Creek, were examined on May 28, 1968.      ~Mustela frenata longicauda~ Bonaparte, 1838    Long-tailed Weasel    This mustelid seems uncommon in northwestern South Dakota. The only  recent reports from Harding County that have come to our attention are  of a female and four or five young that were found in a haystack  \"several years prior to 1963\" (Robert Kriege, personal communication),  and of several individuals seen by a rancher in a hay field along the  Little Missouri about 7 mi. N Camp Crook during mowing operations in  July 1970. Visher (1914:91) regarded the species as \"quite common,\" and  noted that \"4 or 5 dead ones\" were seen along roads in the summer of  1910.      ~Mustela nigripes~ (Audubon and Bachman, 1851)    Black-footed Ferret    In a recent summary of the natural history of this species in South  Dakota, Henderson _et al._ (1969) listed seven localities in Harding  County (all in prairie dog \"towns\") at which ferrets had been sighted or  trapped as follows (dates in parentheses): near Ladner (March, 1963); 17  mi. N Camp Crook (about 1956 or 1957); T. 20 N, R. 3 E (1964); T. 20 N,  R. 4 E (winter, 1964); T. 19 N, R. 1 E (late November, 1966); T. 17 N,  R. 8 E (summer, 1965); T. 15 N, R. 1 E (winter, 1963). These authors  also reported a specimen in the U.S. National Museum (no. 243990) that  was taken at Govert on November 1, 1923. Additionally, Wesley Broer,  then the local game warden, reported to one of our parties that a ferret  was seen on February 27, 1963, at a place 7 mi. N and 16 mi. W Buffalo.    Visher (1914) made no mention of this species in his report of the  natural history of Harding County.      ~Mustela vison letifera~ Hollister, 1913    Mink    Tracks of a mink were observed by a member of one of our field parties  (T. H. Swearingen) in late March of 1963 at a pond 5 mi. S and 14 mi. E  Buffalo, and one was reported to have been trapped in the same area the  previous winter. Reports by local residents indicate that mink occur  along the Little Missouri River as well as streams on the north side of  the North Cave Hills. Visher (1914:91) reported the species to be  uncommon but he knew of one trapped in February of 1911 on Bull Creek.      ~Taxidea taxus taxus~ (Schreber, 1778)    Badger    _Specimens examined_ (4).--Sec. 25, R. 3 E, T. 22 N, 1; NE 1/4 sec. 28,  R. 4 E, T. 19 N, 1; 4 mi. E Reva, 1; 10 mi. S, 2 mi. W Buffalo, 1.    Local residents regarded the badger as relatively common in the  grasslands of Harding County, although this species was only rarely  observed by members of our field parties. Visher (1914:91) reported it  to be \"quite common.\"      ~Spilogale putorius interrupta~ (Rafinesque, 1820)    Spotted Skunk    We took no spotted skunks in northwestern South Dakota and both local  residents and government trappers reported this species to be rare in  the area. Visher (1914:91) indicated that it was \"much more common than  the large skunk\" in the early part of this century.      ~Mephitis mephitis hudsonica~ Richardson, 1829    Striped Skunk    Visher (1914:91) found this species to be \"uncommon\" in Harding County,  as we did more than a half century later. Some local residents, however,  reported this skunk to be fairly abundant. We took one specimen, an  adult female having enlarged mammae that was captured on July 6, 1965,  at a place 7 mi. S and 4-1/2 mi. E Harding, just south of the Short Pine  Hills. Site records of several other striped skunks were obtained as  follows: 14 mi. N Buffalo; 6 mi. N and 2-1/2 mi. W Camp Crook; 5-1/2 mi.  WNW Buffalo; 1-1/2 mi. S and 1/2 mi. E Buffalo; 4 mi. S Buffalo; 10 mi.  SW Ralph; and 1 mi. S Reva.      ~Lutra canadensis interior~ Swenk, 1920    Otter    We have no record of this species in Harding County other than Visher's  (1914:91) report that an individual was \"recently trapped along the  Little Missouri River.\"      ~Felis concolor hippolestes~ Merriam, 1897    Mountain Lion    This large cat likely occurred throughout northwestern South Dakota  prior to settlement by white man. No specimens are available from  Harding County, but Visher (1914:91) reported that an individual  \"visited the East Short Pines in the winter of 1910-11.\" It is doubtful  that _Felis concolor_ occurs in the area today, except possibly as an  occasional transient.      ~Lynx rufus pallescens~ Merriam, 1899    Bobcat    _Specimens examined_ (3).--12 mi. N, 9 mi. W Buffalo, 1; 11 mi. N, 7 mi.  W Buffalo, 1; 9 mi. N, 9 mi. W Buffalo, 1.    The bobcat, although not abundant, is generally distributed throughout  Harding County, particularly in the buttes and badlands. Visher  (1914:90) reported the species as common in the early part of this  century. Our three specimens were shot in March 1963 by professional  hunters sponsored by the Western South Dakota Sheepman Association, two  from the air and one on the ground. Two other bobcats were killed in the  same three-day period (March 25-27).    We tentatively assign our specimens to the subspecies _pallescens_ owing  to their pale color and the general agreement of their external and  cranial measurements with those reported for other specimens of that  race. Geographic variation in _Lynx rufus_ from throughout the Northern  Great Plains is poorly documented, however, and is in need of critical  analysis. External measurements of the three specimens, all males (adult  and two young adults, respectively), are: total length, 870, 925, 820;  length of tail, 142, 176, 155; length of hind foot, 191, 192, 178;  length of ear, 82, 84, 71; weight (pounds), 23, 17, 16. Respective  lengths of testes were 30, 36, and 15. Selected cranial measurements of  the adult and largest young adult are: condylobasal length, 113.7,  111.5; zygomatic breadth, 88.3, 83.7; interorbital constriction, 24.5,  23.5; length of nasals, 30.1, 30.8; length of maxillary toothrow, 37.7,  38.6.      Order Artiodactyla      ~Cervus elaphus canadensis~ Erxleben, 1777    Wapiti or Elk    Visher (1914:87) reported that the last native elk in Harding County was  killed in the Long Pine Hills in 1879, and also mentioned skulls picked  up in the Cave Hills. The origin of a wapiti allegedly shot in the Slim  Buttes in 1956 (Robert Kriege, personal communication) is unknown, but  presumably this individual was a wanderer, possibly from the Black Hills  to the south where elk were reintroduced some years ago.      ~Odocoileus hemionus hemionus~ (Rafinesque, 1817)    Mule Deer    _Specimens examined_ (6).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 1; 9 mi. N, 10 mi. W  Buffalo, 2; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 3.    The mule deer is common in the buttes and adjacent badland areas of the  county, and many were seen by members of each of our field parties.  Local residents reported \"black-tails\" to be widespread in the area and  State Game Protector Merritt Paukarbek reported to Andersen that even  though hunting success was high in the autumn of 1967, there was no  apparent reduction in numbers in the spring of 1968. In contrast, Visher  (1914:88) found this species absent in Harding County in the early  1900's, and stated that it was \"exterminated by 1900.\"    An adult female taken on June 26, 1961, in the North Cave Hills was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],[0,"A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#6)"],[1,"night, until  Charleston was thoroughly familiar with his ridiculously antique yacht,  and had joked itself tired at his expense. Soon an elopement and a  murder tickled the palate of the city, and the Colonel and the _Mary  Jane_ were forgotten. When that stage was reached Charleston knew him no  more. It was now the second of June, and the _Mary Jane_ turned her ugly  prow toward the mouth of the Potomac river.    Every one knows that the Potomac empties itself into the Chesapeake bay.  The Potomac is between ninety and a hundred miles long, in its tortuous  route from Washington to the bay. At its mouth are many inlets. Each one  of these was known to Rupert and the two negro sailors. It was in the  most retired estuary that the _Mary Jane_ cast anchor on the evening of  the fifth of June. At her normal rate of speed she lay within two and a  half hours run of the Capital. At nine, at black of night, she started  for Washington. Her deck-log registered thirty-six knots an hour. She  hugged the shore, where she laid for safe passage, until she modestly  crept to an anchorage near a city wharf. Then the Colonel went ashore  with his two black men and two Swedes, to reconnoitre the town. He  always took with him a preparation of chloroform and another drug,  which, for the sake of public safety, we will not mention. This was  compounded for him in Chicago, by a chemist formerly in the employ of  Anarchists. This preparation was warranted to \"make a man who smelled it  lose consciousness in less time that it takes to say Herr Most.\"    When Colonel Oddminton was last in Washington a casual smoking-room  acquaintance remarked, eying him with the gaze of a professional  physiognomist:    \"If you'd shave off your chin, and keep your hat on, you'd be the very  picture of Senator X----.\"    Now Senator X----, through a revolution of the political wheel, had  become Secretary of State. That casual remark had penetrated into the  imagination of the Colonel. He tried to shake the impression off.  Flattered by this suggestion--no one had ever made it before--he bought  photographs of the Senator, all he could find, and studied them  diligently. For days he haunted the Senate chamber and learned the  personnel of the Senator by heart. [This, it will be remembered, was in  the last administration.] Then was born the thought, Why not make  capital out of this resemblance which art could easily magnify? The  Senator was a millionaire. There might be money in it. But this seemed,  after all, rather impracticable and rather commonplace. The Colonel was  no sneak thief. He had broader elements than that. The man, but not the  blood, was ignorant that his grandfather's great-grandfather was hung  for piracy in England. It would be impossible to state when the  stupendous plot, which he finally executed, shaped itself in his subtile  brain. This idea startled him, haunted him, conquered him; why not  kidnap the President of the United States, demand a ransom and throw  suspicion, for a time at least, upon the wily politician? His thoughts  now worked only in that conduit. Jacobi said that the greater a man's  ability to act for distant ends, the stronger his mind. The Colonel  silently plotted for months. We see where it had led him. Having  studiously perfected himself in the role of Secretary, which he was  prepared to play at a moment's notice, the Colonel spent the remainder  of these last nights in Washington, awaiting an opportunity to capture  the Secretary's coach, after it had been dismissed by its owner for the  night.    He also kept himself closely informed of the President's habits and his  simple domestic hours without arousing any suspicion. All Washington  knew the customs of its unostentatious chief. Society had criticised his  \"affected Democratic ways.\" Every one knew that he habitually retired as  early as a New England deacon, never later than eleven. White House  dissipation was now out of season. The Colonel knew that the interior of  the executive mansion was unguarded at night. Could he once gain access  thereto, the rest of his plot, so ignorant and so trustworthy his tools,  could not miscarry. The Colonel made the attempt for three consecutive  nights to capture the Secretary's coach. He arrived each time in  Washington between eleven and twelve. He knew the approaches to the  stable, and luckily for him, on the dark night of the eighth of June he  accomplished his design, how successfully the reader well knows.    The strategic Colonel, with his four devoted men, invaded the privacy of  the White House at exactly quarter of two o'clock in the morning; he had  the aid of a card taken from the case in the coupe, and the  re-enforcement of his now marvellous resemblance. What he now did the  veriest tyro could have performed. He had not meant to abduct the first  lady of the land, but what could he do with her? His native chivalry  would not permit him to harm her, though the President was made  unconscious by the aid of the Chicago anaesthetic. The wife entreated to  accompany her husband. She would undergo any fate so that he should not  be taken without her. On condition of perfect quiet her wish was  gratified. She was softly led, the President was carried, down the  deserted stairs. The familiar state coach bore the distinguished victims  away, and the deed that baffled the detective skill of the country was  done with an ease which seems ridiculous.    The next evening the President and his wife might have been seen by  Inspector Byrnes, had he been there, silently sitting on the deck of a  murky-looking vessel, bearing name _Mary Jane_, and anchored in a little  cove off a swamp and cottage on Oddminton Island. So remote and quiet  was this locality that the rumor of the President's effacement had not  even reached it. The kidnapped couple waited patiently for the relief  that they momentarily expected. They had no news, nothing but scrupulous  consideration, attention, and a respectful but firm guard night and day.  But rescue did not come.    One member of that dark crew was left in Washington to hold continual  communication with the Colonel. This was the boy Rupert, who, if he had  suspected by this time what had happened, was either too loyal or too  terrified to reveal the fact. The letters that astonished the world were  written by the Colonel, sent to his son sealed, directed each in a  different handwriting, and stamped with full instructions how and where  to mail them. The boy had travelled faithfully and far. Of course a  letter posted by an innocent-looking boy of fifteen, who was unsuspected  and unknown, was able to baffle the law. He was the only confederate, a  helpless and faithful tool.    A country that opens itself in so many ways to foreign foes must not be  startled if one of its own sons, perceiving the weakness of the armor,  should take advantage of it and choose his direction for the vital  thrust. The Colonel aimed high. He kept his counsel and accomplished the  incredible in the simplest way. Who thought of him and the crazy _Mary  Jane_? The President and his wife were as far away from rescue as if  they were on the Island of Borneo. There are a thousand such places on  our coast where a hostile fleet might ride without even the suspicion of  our \"Lord High Admiral.\"    It was ten minutes of eight o'clock on the morning of the eighth of  July. A fleet of many hundred vessels of every description lined the  banks of the Potomac opposite the revered home of Washington. There were  gunboats and catboats, excursion steamers and yachts from every part of  the country. They idly lay at anchor, or jogged barely enough to hold  their own in the tidal river. All flags hung at half-mast. While most  eyes scanned the heights with impatient glance, others watched the water  for a revelation. The sides of the hills were black with humanity. The  world seemed to wait there with a throe of hope subsiding to an interval  of despair.    The high officials of the government were standing on the quarter-deck  of the new man-of-war. _The Washington_. Each had a pair of glasses to  his intent eyes. This was the moment when the Secretary of State, from  his high elevation, spied a long, low vessel moving slowly amid the  floating palaces and dreary hulks. It seemed apologetic in its  movements, and afforded a sad contrast to the jaunty yachts it almost  grazed. None but the Secretary had as yet noticed this in significant  boat. Somehow it fascinated him, and he followed it intently. It was  propelled by steam, and crept up as if it wanted a nearer view of the  morning's performance.    Now a police patrol launch whistled that way, and gave the sailor at the  wheel an abrupt command to bring her up to a stop. Hardly was this order  given when there came a puff of smoke from her uncouth bow, and an  ominous flaming sword appeared against the dead gray sky. A sound that  could at first have been mistaken for a subterranean growl rolled upon  the still air. When the second flaming sword flashed into mid-heaven the  mutter of the populace became a roar. It was true! True! The President  and their lady were at hand and in their midst. Two more ill-omened  rockets gleamed above. Was it execration or was it joy--this mighty  sound that broke from river to shore? Then silence came again. Eyes  strained to see this mysterious thing that made straight for the great  man-of-war. But one soul was seen on its dingy decks. Only the man at  the wheel was visible. He was clad in black. A hundred vessels  instinctively closed about this daring and defiant craft. Its escape was  cut off. It could neither go to the right nor to the left, forward nor  back. It sullenly stopped.    Then came a whistling shriek, followed by a cannon peal from its  forequarter--another--and the flag of black and crimson crowned by the  gilt eagle, touched by unseen hands, shot like a baleful spirit from  the peak.    \"Keep "]]]
