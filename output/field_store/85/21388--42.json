On account of the mere similitude existing between the doctrine of  progressive creation, as it is set forth in the geological record, and  the idea of progressive evolutions, as claimed by the advocates of the  speculation, we deem it our duty to scrutinize severely the teachings of  geology. But in doing this we do not concede that there is no other  ground upon which such authors may be successfully met. There is no one  point in their system which is not hypothetical. It is a system of  _ifs_. There is no proof, in any single instance, that a higher has been  developed from a lower species; but the question, in proper shape, is  this: Has there been a succession of improvements from one geological  period to another in the several divisions of the animal and vegetable  kingdoms amounting to a change of species? Species are very similar in  structure and capable of some improvement, but this is no evidence of  the higher being developed from the lower. It is well known that the  lowest forms are those found lowest in the geological series. Commencing  at the bottom and running up we find, first, mollusks, then fishes,  reptiles, birds, quadrupeds, monkeys, and at last man. But this does  not, by any means, settle the issue. The question naturally arises  whether one of those divisions, on its first appearance, was of the  lowest organization of its class and reached the highest by a gradual  development through successive geological periods. The geological  testimony is this: First, there were no animals having any structural  resemblance to the fishes prior to their creation, and when they appear  they are already in possession of the highest organization and the  largest cerebral development.    During the long periods of geological history there has been no advance  in this class of animals. The science testifies to no successive steps  here. \"They stood at the head of the icthyic division at the outset; but  there has been, during these periods, a progressive _degeneracy_, so  that though all possessed a high organization at first, there is found  in the after creations a _succession of lapses_ until the division of  fishes now contains species ranking little above the earth-worm.\" \"A  single well defined placoid fossil in the Bala limestone as fully proves  the existence of placoid fishes, during the period of its deposition, as  if the rock were made up of placoid fossils, for it is not a question of  numbers, but of rank.\" The question, now, comes home to us with all its  force, how did fishes of this high order come to exist before any of the  inferior class? Let some of our evolution savans answer.    The same thing may be said of other organic divisions. It has gone to  record that the shell-fish of the Silurian system are the lowest  division of the molluscous animals. While the statement is received as  true, it must be remembered that there is some diversity of structure in  this lower division, and that the earliest molluscs are not the lowest,  but the highest in the division. The most important point, however, is,  that while Brachiopoda were most abundant, the highest molluscs existed  also, their remains being found in the Bala limestone, which is the  lowest bed of molluscous fossils. (See Silurian System, p. 308.) The  number of these higher species is not important. They existed, few or  many, as early as any other of the mollusca. If the lower had not an  anterior existence, the higher were not developed from them. It is also  a conclusive argument against the system, that while the intermediate  mollusca are very numerous, the cephalopoda, which were so early  introduced, and are the higher forms that were so numerous at certain  times, are now narrowed down to a few species.    Lyell was the first to drop a word of caution against \"inferring too  hastily from the absence of mammalian fossils in the older rocks that  the higher class of vertebrata did not exist in those remote times.\"  \"The remains of vertebrate animals are already found in the lowest  fossiliferous rocks, and, in addition to that, the highest forms of  each class appear first.\"    There is nothing so well evinced in all the realms of scientific  investigation as the utter impossibility of getting, by the light of  nature, away from the idea of the Christian's God. _Everywhere_ we trace  his footsteps. Traveling through the ages to the beginning, in thought,  our first view is that of \"an unlimited expanse of unoccupied space,\"  or, if aught exists, it lies hidden in the invisible state. But all at  once, as if by magic, and in obedience to the will of the Eternal  Intelligence, the invisible becomes visible, worlds exist and become  obedient to law. The divine perfections are to be displayed through  future ages. And now, if we look out upon the surging billows of the  ocean, our mind swells with the thought that God is there in all his  majesty. With our thoughts confined to our earth we pass from age to age  tracing the divine power from the laws of motion to chemical action and  crystallization, until we behold a wonderful change upon the face of  nature. And now, for the first time, a new principle is manifested, a  new order springs into being--it is vegetable life and being in all its  lovely grandeur. It matters not to us whether it came about gradually or  all at once, for wisdom is there. All nature seems to turn to this new  principle. \"The elements of the inorganic world are subserving the  purposes of organic life.\" The Creator has bound them to organic life.  Every plant selects its food from the elements of earth by a chemistry  of its own. The atmosphere around us is no less to the vegetable kingdom  than a great pasture field. Every leaf is feasting, and every fiber is  touched by the light. What wonderful correlations meet us at every turn!  What adaptation of means to ends! Above all the beauty and grandeur of  the vegetable kingdom we find the glorious animal, with man at the head,  as lord over all below him. With man the moral government of God begins;  physical creation is over. The subsequent manifestations of the divine  glory are to be realized in the training and discipline of men and women  as moral beings; and their mutual association with him, in the eternal  world, is the ultimate.      C. R.          PANTHEISM IS DECEPTION AND HYPOCRISY.      \"Understand, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, when will ye be  wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the  eye, shall he not see? He that chastiseth the heathen, shall he be not  correct? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall he not know?\"--Psalm  xciv, 8, 9.    Pantheism, personified, is a hypocrite, a deceiver. The name God, as a  proper name in the English language, means the Divine Being, Jehovah,  the Eternal and Infinite Spirit, the Creator and Lord of the universe.  Pantheists say they believe in God, but they tell you, when pressed,  they mean by that name \"everything\"--_God is everything._ The term  \"Pantheist\" is from _pan_, all, and _theos_, God. Webster defines the  term thus: \"One that believes the universe to be God; a name given to  the followers of Spinoza.\"    Has any man the right to pervert language, fixing new meanings to words  in common use which are in direct opposition to established usage? The  man who knows the meaning of a word and uses it in a contrary sense is  guilty of an abuse of language; and if he fails to make known the fact  that he is using the term in a sense differing from established usage,  he is, then, a deceiver. Pantheists are simply Atheists in disguise, the  only difference being in their professions. The Pantheist says, \"I  believe in a God;\" but this saying is only a distinction without a  difference. The atheist is the frank, outspoken man of the two.    What must we think of the man who says, \"I believe in God,\" and then  explains himself to mean, by the name God, heat, steam, electricity,  force, animal life, the soul of man, magnetism, mesmeric force, and, in  one word, the sum of all the intelligences and forces in the universe,  at the same time denying the proper currency of the term God by denying  the existence of a personal God. All Christians should demand that  Christian terms be used in their own proper currency. But infidels will  always do as they have hitherto, will often get out of their own \"ruts,\"  by the most perfect abuse of language. They can not, it seems, leave off  the use of language which is only appropriate to the Christian idea.  Their divinity, by their own confession, differs essentially from God,  and let them use a different word to describe it. Let them do like their  heathen brethren in India, call it Brahma, or whatever else they please,  and cease \"stealing Heaven's livery to serve the devil.\" Let them cease  to profane religion and offend common sense by giving the name of the  glorious Father of Spirits to their million-headed nondescript.  Pantheism dethrones Jehovah and places no other intelligence in his  place as Creator and Ruler of the universe; and, being conscious of the  odium that necessarily attaches itself to Atheism, on account of its  everlasting foolishness, they steal the name of God to cloak their  Atheism.    _Pantheism is demoralizing._ It cuts a man loose from all the sanctions  of moral law, by denying the resurrection, the judgment and the future  retribution. It annihilates from the mind of its votary the idea of  God's moral government. If man, as it avows, be the highest intelligence  in the universe of worlds, to whom will he render an account? Who will  call upon him to answer? If men and women are simply developments of  God, will God be offended with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28669"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. 8, (#6)"],[1,"there  were \"six millions of Christians in existence in the year three hundred  and thirteen.\" It is reasonable to allow that there were three millions  in the year one hundred and seventy-five. Under the best emperors of the  second century books were cheap. Thousands of persons engaged in writing  histories for a livelihood. It is allowed that there were as many as  fifteen thousand copies of the four gospels in circulation among the  people in the last quarter of the second century. This state of things  seems to convey the idea that it would be hard work to introduce  successfully any corruption into the text after this period of time. It  would be too easily detected.    There is also a grand argument in favor of the genuineness of our  religion, which is in the fact that it was in deathly opposition to both  Judaism and Paganism, its success being the destruction of both. If  Christianity was an imposition, its success during the first three  centuries of our era is utterly inexplicable.          WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AND DONE WITHOUT THE BIBLE.      Our ancestors complained of the reign of wickedness; we complain of it  and our posterity will complain of it. I sometimes think we are all a  set of complainers and grumblers.    Of ancient pagans it is said: \"They worshiped and served the creature  more than the Creator.\" Of their idols Persius, who was a Roman  satirical poet, born A.D. 34, said:      \"O, cares of men! O, world all fraught     With vanities! O, minds inclined     Towards earth, all void of heavenly thought!\"    Sedulius, an ancient Christian poet, and by nativity a Scotchman, says  of the same:      \"Ah! wretched they that worship vanities,      And consecrate dumb idols in their heart--     Who their own Maker, God on high, despise,      And fear the works of their own hands and art!     What fury, what great madness doth beguile      Men's minds that man should ugly shapes adore     Of birds, or bulls, or dragons, or the vile      Half-dog, half-man, on knees for aid implore.\"    One of their own poets jests them thus:      \"Even now I was the stock of an old fig tree,     The workman doubting what I then should be,     A bench or god, at last a god made me.\"    The Romans, for a time, were without images for any religious use, but  afterwards they received into their city the idols of all the nations  they conquered; and as they became the lords of the whole earth, they  became slaves to the idols of all the world. Seneca says: \"The images of  the gods they worship, those they pray unto with bended knees, _those_  they admire and adore, and contemn the artificers who made them.\"    The character and condition of their gods was worse than their own. The  common opinion touching their god of gods, _Jupiter_, was that he was  entombed in Crete, and his monument was there to be seen. Lactantius  _wittily_ says: \"Tell me, I beseech you, how can the same god be alive  in one place and dead in another; have a temple dedicated to him in one  place and a tomb erected in another?\" Callimachus, in his hymn on  _Jupiter_, calls the Cretians liars in this very respect. He says:      \"The Cretians always lyars are, who raised unto thy name     A sepulchre, that never dyest, but ever art the same.\"    Lactantius informs us in book 10, chapter 20, that they gave divine  honor to notorious common prostitutes, as unto _goddesses_, to _Venus_,  or _Faula_, to _Lapa_, the nurse of _Romulus_, so called among the  shepherds for her common prostitution, and to Flora, who enriched  herself by her crime, and then, by will, made the people of Rome her  heir, and, also left a sum of money by which her birthday was yearly  celebrated with games, which, in memory of her, they called _Floralia_.  They claimed that their great goddess, _Juno_, was both the wife and  sister of Jupiter; and Jupiter, and the other gods, they held, were no  better that adulterers, sodomites, murderers and thieves. Such was not  held in private but published to the world. They were described by their  painters in their tables, by their poets in their verses, and acted by  their players upon their stages. (Lactantius, b. 5, ch. 21.)    As respects the manner in which they worshiped their gods, Alexander, in  his Dierum Genialium, b. 6, ch. 26, insists that the most odious thing  in their history was the effusion of human blood in the service of their  gods. This same author says, \"This unnatural, barbarous practice spread  itself well nigh over the known world; it was in use among the Trojans,  as it seems from Virgil's lines touching AEneas:      \"Their hands behind their backs he bound whom he had destined     A sacrifice unto the ghosts, and on whose flames to shed     Their blood he purposed.\"--_AEnead._    Some ignorant infidels seem at a great loss to understand why the Lord  should order the groves and altars of the heathen destroyed. (Again and  again their groves were cut down.) The children of Israel were to make  no offerings in the groves. If infidels will only exercise common sense  inside of the history of the worship of Priapus and Berecynthia, they  will cease fretting over the destruction of those beautiful forests.  Those groves were the most corrupt places upon the earth, places of  retirement from the altar into prostitution, carried on as a matter of  worship pleasing to Priapus. Here, on account of becoming modesty, the  half can not be told. The removal of nuisances in our own country is  conducted upon the same principles upon which groves were destroyed by  the Israelites.    Lycurgus dedicated an image to laughter, to be worshiped as a god, and  this is said to be \"the only law he ever made pertaining to religion.\"  While his great object was to make warriors, he ordained some things  noted for the education of youth. He ordained other laws so much in  favor of lust and all carnality of the worst kind, that it might justly  be said he made his entire commonwealth ludicrous. He instituted  wrestlings, dances and other exercises of boys and girls naked, to be  done in public at divers times of the year, in the presence both of  young and old men. Adultery was also approved and permitted by the laws  of Lycurgus. Plato and Aristotle advocated community of women, of goods  and possessions, to the end that no man should have anything peculiar to  himself, or know his own children. This was ordained by Plato, in order  to establish in the commonwealth such a perfect unity that no man might  be able to say, that is thine, or this is mine.    Aristotle, in the second book of his \"_Politiques_,\" sets forth many  other detestable things. Lactantius, in the third of his Divine  Institutions, shows that Plato's community of property and women took  away frugality, abstinence, shamefacedness, modesty and justice itself.    Plato, like Lycurgus, ordained that young men should, for the increase  of their physical strength and agility of body, at certain times  exercise themselves naked; that girls and servant-maids should dance  naked among the young men; that women in the flower of their youth  should dance, run, wrestle and ride with young men naked as well as  they, which, says Plato, \"whosoever misliketh understandeth not how  profitable it is for the commonwealth.\"    The morality of ancient times may be clearly seen in the fact that all  manner of debasing things were brought to the front. How could men be  persuaded that adultery should be punished when they were taught from  infancy that it was a virtue among the gods? _Lucian_ gives his  experience thus, \"When I was yet a boy, and heard out of _Homer_ and  _Hesiod_ of the adulteries, fornications, rapes and seditions of the  gods, truly I thought that those things were very excellent, and began  even then to be greatly affected towards them, for I could not imagine  that the gods themselves would ever have committed adultery if they had  not esteemed the same lawful and good.\" To all this it may be added that  the opinions of the ancient philosophers concerning virtue, vice, the  final happiness, and the state of the spirit after death, were diverse  and contradictory. The Epicurean doctrine was, that sovereign happiness  consisted in pleasure. They granted a God, but denied his Providence; so  virtue was without a spur, and vice without a bridle.    The Stoics also granted a Divine Providence, but they maintained such a  fatal necessity that they blunted the edge of all virtuous efforts and  excused themselves in vicious conduct. Both Stoics and Epicureans  doubted the immortality of the human spirit, and thereby opened the way  to all manner of licentiousness.    I am persuaded that eternity alone will fully reveal the consequences of  a denial of a future life and retribution; it is a physical leprosy  which removes all the most powerful incentives to virtue and loosens up  the soul to all manner of lustful gratifications.    A man once remarked: \"I have lived four years an avowed infidel. I have  boasted that I would live a good man and die an infidel. I have formed  the acquaintance of all the leading infidels of my country, and I am now  prepared to candidly confess that I do not believe any man can keep a  good heart without the fear of God. Such is my observation and  experience.\"          THE LATEST EVOLUTIONARY CONFLICT.    THEY FIRST WISH IT TO BE SO, THEN SOON, WITHOUT PROOF, THEY ASSERT THAT  IT IS SO!    (_From the Cincinnati Gazette, of June 26, 1880._)    \"Prof. Huxley is assured that the doctrine of evolution, so far as the  animal world is concerned, is no longer a speculation, but a statement  of historical fact, taking its place along side of those accepted truths  which must be taken into account by philosophers of all schools.\"    This statement was the summing up of an address delivered at the Royal  Institution on the 19th of March.
