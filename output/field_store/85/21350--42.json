[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],[0,"Ali Pacha (#6)"],[1,"of the great names of Europe, had succeeded in  divining, and as a natural consequence of his active and practical  character, in also realising Macchiavelli, as is amply shown in the  expansion of his greatness and the exercise of his power. Without faith  in God, despising men, loving and thinking only of himself, distrusting  all around him, audacious in design, immovable in resolution, inexorable  in execution, merciless in vengeance, by turns insolent, humble,  violent, or supple according to circumstances, always and entirely  logical in his egotism, he is Cesar Borgia reborn as a Mussulman; he is  the incarnate ideal of Florentine policy, the Italian prince converted  into a satrap.    Age had as yet in no way impaired Ali's strength and activity, and  nothing prevented his profiting by the advantages of his position.  Already possessing great riches, which every day saw increasing under  his management, he maintained a large body of warlike and devoted  troops, he united the offices of Pacha of two tails of Janina, of  Toparch of Thessaly, and of Provost Marshal of the Highway. As  influential aids both to his reputation for general ability and the  terror of his' arms, and his authority as ruler, there stood by his side  two sons, Mouktar and Veli, offspring of his wife Emineh, both fully  grown and carefully educated in the principles of their father.    Ali's first care, once master of Janina, was to annihilate the beys  forming the aristocracy of the place, whose hatred he was well aware of,  and whose plots he dreaded. He ruined them all, banishing many and  putting others to death. Knowing that he must make friends to supply the  vacancy caused by the destruction of his foes, he enriched with the  spoil the Albanian mountaineers in his pay, known by the name of  Skipetars, on whom he conferred most of the vacant employments. But much  too prudent to allow all the power to fall into the hands of a single  caste, although a foreign one to the capital, he, by a singular  innovation, added to and mixed with them an infusion of Orthodox Greeks,  a skilful but despised race, whose talents he could use without having  to dread their influence. While thus endeavouring on one side to destroy  the power of his enemies by depriving them of both authority and wealth,  and on the other to consolidate his own by establishing a firm  administration, he neglected no means of acquiring popularity. A fervent  disciple of Mahomet when among fanatic Mussulmans, a materialist with  the Bektagis who professed a rude pantheism, a Christian among the  Greeks, with whom he drank to the health of the Holy Virgin, he made  everywhere partisans by flattering the idea most in vogue. But if he  constantly changed both opinions and language when dealing with  subordinates whom it was desirable to win over, Ali towards his  superiors had one only line of conduct which he never transgressed.  Obsequious towards the Sublime Porte, so long as it did not interfere  with his private authority, he not only paid with exactitude all dues to  the sultan, to whom he even often advanced money, but he also pensioned  the most influential ministers. He was bent on having no enemies who  could really injure his power, and he knew that in an absolute  government no conviction can hold its own against the power of gold.    Having thus annihilated the nobles, deceived the multitude with  plausible words and lulled to sleep the watchfulness of the Divan, Ali  resolved to turn his arms against Kormovo. At the foot of its rocks he  had, in youth, experienced the disgrace of defeat, and during thirty  nights Kamco and Chainitza had endured all horrors of outrage at the  hands of its warriors. Thus the implacable pacha had a twofold wrong to  punish, a double vengeance to exact.    This time, profiting by experience, he called in the aid of treachery.  Arrived at the citadel, he negotiated, promised an amnesty, forgiveness  for all, actual rewards for some. The inhabitants, only too happy to  make peace with so formidable an adversary, demanded and obtained a  truce to settle the conditions. This was exactly what Ali expected, and  Kormovo, sleeping on the faith of the treaty, was suddenly attacked and  taken. All who did not escape by flight perished by the sword in the  darkness, or by the hand of the executioner the next morning. Those who  had offered violence aforetime to Ali's mother and sister were carefully  sought for, and whether convicted or merely accused, were impaled on  spits, torn with redhot pincers, and slowly roasted between two fires;  the women were shaved and publicly scourged, and then sold as slaves.    This vengeance, in which all the nobles of the province not yet entirely  ruined were compelled to assist, was worth a decisive victory to Ali.  Towns, cantons, whole districts, overwhelmed with terror, submitted  without striking a blow, and his name, joined to the recital of a  massacre which ranked as a glorious exploit in the eyes of this savage  people, echoed like thunder from valley to valley and mountain to  mountain. In order that all surrounding him might participate in the joy  of his success Ali gave his army a splendid festival. Of unrivalled  activity, and, Mohammedan only in name, he himself led the chorus in the  Pyrrhic and Klephtic dances, the ceremonials of warriors and of robbers.  There was no lack of wine, of sheep, goats, and lambs roasted before  enormous fires; made of the debris of the ruined city; antique games of  archery and wrestling were celebrated, and the victors received their  prizes from the hand of their chief. The plunder, slaves, and cattle  were then shared, and the Tapygae, considered as the lowest of the four  tribes composing the race of Skipetars, and ranking as the refuse of the  army, carried off into the mountains of Acroceraunia, doors, windows,  nails, and even the tiles of the houses, which were then all surrendered  to the flames.    However, Ibrahim, the successor and son-in-law of Kurd Pacha, could not  see with indifference part of his province invaded by his ambitious  neighbour. He complained and negotiated, but obtaining no satisfaction,  called out an army composed of Skipetars of Toxid, all Islamites, and  gave the command to his brother Sepher, Bey of Avlone. Ali, who had  adopted the policy of opposing alternately the Cross to the Crescent and  the Crescent to the Cross, summoned to his aid the Christian chiefs of  the mountains, who descended into the plains at the head of their  unconquered troops. As is generally the case in Albania, where war is  merely an excuse for brigandage, instead of deciding matters by a  pitched battle, both sides contented themselves with burning villages,  hanging peasants, and carrying off cattle.    Also, in accordance with the custom of the country, the women interposed  between the combatants, and the good and gentle Emineh laid proposals of  peace before Ibrahim Pacha, to whose apathetic disposition a state of  war was disagreeable, and who was only too happy to conclude a fairly  satisfactory negotiation. A family alliance was arranged, in virtue of  which Ali retained his conquests, which were considered as the marriage  portion of Ibrahim's eldest daughter, who became the wife of Ali's  eldest son, Mouktar.    It was hoped that this peace might prove permanent, but the marriage  which sealed the treaty was barely concluded before a fresh quarrel  broke out between the pachas. Ali, having wrung such important  concessions from the weakness of his neighbour, desired to obtain yet  more. But closely allied to Ibrahim were two persons gifted with great  firmness of character and unusual ability, whose position gave them  great influence. They were his wife Zaidee, and his brother Sepher, who  had been in command during the war just terminated. As both were  inimical to Ali, who could not hope to corrupt them, the latter resolved  to get rid of them.    Having in the days of his youth been intimate with Kurd Pacha, Ali had  endeavoured to seduce his daughter, already the wife of Ibrahim. Being  discovered by the latter in the act of scaling the wall of his harem, he  had been obliged to fly the country. Wishing now to ruin the woman whom  he had formerly tried to corrupt, Ali sought to turn his former crime to  the success of a new one. Anonymous letters, secretly sent to Ibrahim,  warned him that his wife intended to poison him, in order to be able  later to marry Ali Pacha, whom she had always loved. In a country like  Turkey, where to suspect a woman is to accuse her, and accusation is  synonymous with condemnation, such a calumny might easily cause the  death of the innocent Zaidee. But if Ibrahim was weak and indolent, he  was also confiding and generous. He took the letters; to his wife, who  had no difficulty in clearing herself, and who warned him against the  writer, whose object and plots she easily divined, so that this odious  conspiracy turned only to Ali's discredit. But the latter was not likely  either to concern himself as to what others said or thought about him or  to be disconcerted by a failure. He simply turned his machinations  against his other enemy, and arranged matters this time so as to avoid a  failure.    He sent to Zagori, a district noted for its doctors, for a quack who  undertook to poison Sepher Bey on condition of receiving forty purses.  When all was settled, the miscreant set out for Berat, and was  immediately accused by Ali of evasion, and his wife and children were  arrested as accomplices and detained, apparently as hostages for the  good behaviour of their husband and father, but really as pledges for  his silence when the crime should have been accomplished. Sepher Bey,  informed of this by letters which Ali wrote to the Pacha of Berat  demanding the fugitive, thought that a man persecuted by his enemy would  be faithful to himself, and took the supposed runaway into his service.  The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#6)"],[1,"town where she lived and the neighbouring  country that nothing else was talked about.    This story made a great impression on the company, on account of the  condition of the countess; the dowager added that it was very wrong to  ridicule these humble country experts, who often through observation and  experience discovered secrets which proud doctors were unable to unravel  with all their studies. Hereupon the count cried out that this midwife  must be sent for, as she was just the kind of woman they wanted. After  this other matters were talked about, the marquis changing the  conversation; he had gained his point in quietly introducing the thin  end of the wedge of his design.    After dinner, the company walked on the terrace. The countess dowager  not being able to walk much on account of her advanced age, the countess  and Madame de Bouille took chairs beside her. The count walked up and  down with M. de Saint-Maixent. The marquis naturally asked how things  had been going on during his absence, and if Madame de Saint-Geran had  suffered any inconvenience, for her pregnancy had become the most  important affair in the household, and hardly anything else was talked  about.    \"By the way,\" said the count, \"you were speaking just now of a very  skilful midwife; would it not be a good step to summon her?\"    \"I think,\" replied the marquis, \"that it would be an excellent  selection, for I do not suppose there is one in this neighbourhood to  compare to her.\"    \"I have a great mind to send for her at once, and to keep her about the  countess, whose constitution she will be all the better acquainted with  if she studies it beforehand. Do you know where I can send for her?\"    \"Faith,\" said the marquis, \"she lives in a village, but I don't know  which.\"    \"But at least you know her name?\"    \"I can hardly remember it. Louise Boyard, I think, or Polliard, one or  the other.\"    \"How! have you not even retained the name?\"    \"I heard the story, that's all. Who the deuce can keep a name in his  head which he hears in such a chance fashion?\"    \"But did the condition of the countess never occur to you?\"    \"It was so far away that I did not suppose you would send such a  distance. I thought you were already provided.\"    \"How can we set about to find her?\"    \"If that is all, I have a servant who knows people in that part of the  country, and who knows how to go about things: if you like, he shall go  in quest of her.\"    \"If I like? This very moment.\"    The same evening the servant started on his errand with the count's  instructions, not forgetting those of his master. He went at full speed.  It may readily be supposed that he had not far to seek the woman he was  to bring back with him; but he purposely kept away for three days, and  at the end of this time Louise Goillard was installed in the chateau.    She was a woman of plain and severe exterior, who at once inspired  confidence in everyone. The plots of the marquis and Madame de Bouille  thus throve with most baneful success; but an accident happened which  threatened to nullify them, and, by causing a great disaster, to prevent  a crime.    The countess, passing into her apartments, caught her foot in a carpet,  and fell heavily on the floor. At the cries of a footman all the  household was astir. The countess was carried to bed; the most intense  alarm prevailed; but no bad consequences followed this accident, which  produced only a further succession of visits from the neighbouring  gentry. This happened about the end of the seventh month.    At length the moment of accouchement came. Everything had long before  been arranged for the delivery, and nothing remained to be done. The  marquis had employed all this time in strengthening Madame de Bouille  against her scruples. He often saw Louise Goillard in private, and gave  her his instructions; but he perceived that the corruption of Baulieu,  the house steward, was an essential factor. Baulieu was already half  gained over by the interviews of the year preceding; a large sum of  ready money and many promises did the rest. This wretch was not ashamed  to join a plot against a master to whom he owed everything. The  marchioness for her part, and always under the instigation of M. de  Saint-Maixent, secured matters all round by bringing into the abominable  plot the Quinet girls, her maids; so that there was nothing but treason  and conspiracy against this worthy family among their upper servants,  usually styled confidential. Thus, having prepared matters, the  conspirators awaited the event.    On the 16th of August the Countess de Saint-Geran was overtaken by the  pangs of labour in the chapel of the chateau, where she was hearing  mass. They carried her to her room before mass was over, her women ran  around her, and the countess dowager with her own hands arranged on her  head a cap of the pattern worn by ladies about to be confined--a cap  which is not usually removed till some time later.    The pains recurred with terrible intensity. The count wept at his wife's  cries. Many persons were present. The dowager's two daughters by her  second marriage, one of whom, then sixteen years of age, afterwards  married the Duke de Ventadour and was a party to the lawsuit, wished to  be present at this accouchement, which was to perpetuate by a new scion  an illustrious race near extinction. There were also Dame Saligny,  sister of the late Marshal Saint-Geran, the Marquis de Saint-Maixent,  and the Marchioness de Bouille.    Everything seemed to favour the projects of these last two persons, who  took an interest in the event of a very different character from that  generally felt. As the pains produced no result, and the accouchement  was of the most difficult nature, while the countess was near the last  extremity, expresses were sent to all the neighbouring parishes to offer  prayers for the mother and the child; the Holy Sacrament was elevated in  the churches at Moulins.    The midwife attended to everything herself. She maintained that the  countess would be more comfortable if her slightest desires were  instantly complied with. The countess herself never spoke a word, only  interrupting the gloomy silence by heart-rending cries. All at once,  Madame de Boulle, who affected to be bustling about, pointed out that  the presence of so many persons was what hindered the countess's  accouchement, and, assuming an air of authority justified by fictitious  tenderness, said that everyone must retire, leaving the patient in the  hands of the persons who were absolutely necessary to her, and that, to  remove any possible objections, the countess dowager her mother must set  the example. The opportunity was made use of to remove the count from  this harrowing spectacle, and everyone followed the countess dowager.  Even the countess's own maids were not allowed to remain, being sent on  errands which kept them out of the way. This further reason was given,  that the eldest being scarcely fifteen, they were too young to be  present on such an occasion. The only persons remaining by the bedside  were the Marchioness de Bouille, the midwife, and the two Quinet girls;  the countess was thus in the hands of her most cruel enemies.    It was seven o'clock in the evening; the labours continued; the elder  Quinet girl held the patient by the hand to soothe her. The count and  the dowager sent incessantly to know the news. They were told that  everything was going on well, and that shortly their wishes would be  accomplished; but none of the servants were allowed to enter the room.    Three hours later, the midwife declared that the countess could not hold  out any longer unless she got some rest. She made her swallow a liquor  which was introduced into her mouth by spoonfuls. The countess fell into  so deep a sleep that she seemed to be dead. The younger Quinet girl  thought for a moment that they had killed her, and wept in a corner of  the room, till Madame de Bouille reassured her.    During this frightful night a shadowy figure prowled in the corridors,  silently patrolled the rooms, and came now and then to the door of the  bedroom, where he conferred in a low tone with the midwife and the  Marchioness de Bouille. This was the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, who gave  his orders, encouraged his people, watched over every point of his plot,  himself a prey to the agonies of nervousness which accompany the  preparations for a great crime.    The dowager countess, owing to her great age, had been compelled to take  some rest. The count sat up, worn out with fatigue, in a downstairs room  hard by that in which they were compassing the ruin of all most dear to  him in the world.    The countess, in her profound lethargy, gave birth, without being aware  of it, to a boy, who thus fell on his entry into the world into the  hands of his enemies, his mother powerless to defend him by her cries  and tears. The door was half opened, and a man who was waiting outside  brought in; this was the major-domo Baulieu.    The midwife, pretending to afford the first necessary cares to the  child, had taken it into a corner. Baulieu watched her movements, and  springing upon her, pinioned her arms. The wretched woman dug her nails  into the child's head. He snatched it from her, but the poor infant for  long bore the marks of her claws.    Possibly the Marchioness de Bouille could not nerve herself to the  commission of so great a crime; but it seems more probable that the  steward prevented the destruction of the child under the orders of M. de  Saint-Maixent. The theory is that the marquis, mistrustful of the  promise made him by Madame de Bouille to marry him after the death of  her husband, desired to keep the child to oblige her to keep her word,  under threats of getting him acknowledged, if she proved faithless to  him. No other adequate reason can be conjectured to determine a man of  his character to take such great care of"]]]
