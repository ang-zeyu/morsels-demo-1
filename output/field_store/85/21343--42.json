We both took the crown  of honor together, but you would alone take the crown of beauty,  Angelique.\" Amelie stood off a pace or two, and looked at her friend  from head to foot with honest admiration, \"and would deserve to wear it  too,\" added she.    \"I like to hear you say that, Amelie; I should prefer the crown of  beauty to all other crowns! You half smile at that, but I must tell the  truth, if you do. But you were always a truth-teller, you know, in the  convent, and I was not so! Let us cease flatteries.\"    Angelique felt highly flattered by the praise of Amelie, whom she had  sometimes condescended to envy for her graceful figure and lovely,  expressive features.    \"Gentlemen often speak as you do, Amelie,\" continued she, \"but, pshaw!  they cannot judge as girls do, you know. But do you really think me  beautiful? and how beautiful? Compare me to some one we know.\"    \"I can only compare you to yourself, Angelique. You are more beautiful  than any one I know,\" Amelie burst out in frank enthusiasm.    \"But, really and truly, do you think me beautiful, not only in your  eyes, but in the judgment of the world?\"    Angelique brushed back her glorious hair and stared fixedly in the  face of her friend, as if seeking confirmation of something in her own  thoughts.    \"What a strange question, Angelique! Why do you ask me in that way?\"    \"Because,\" replied she with bitterness, \"I begin to doubt it. I have  been praised for my good looks until I grow weary of the iteration; but  I believed the lying flattery once,--as what woman would not, when it is  repeated every day of her life?\"    Amelie looked sufficiently puzzled. \"What has come over you, Angelique?  Why should you doubt your own charms? or really, have you found at last  a case in which they fail you?\"    Very unlikely, a man would say at first, second, or third sight of  Angelique des Meloises. She was indeed a fair girl to look upon,--tall,  and fashioned in nature's most voluptuous mould, perfect in the symmetry  of every part, with an ease and beauty of movement not suggestive of  spiritual graces, like Amelie's, but of terrestrial witcheries, like  those great women of old who drew down the very gods from Olympus, and  who in all ages have incited men to the noblest deeds, or tempted them  to the greatest crimes.    She was beautiful of that rare type of beauty which is only reproduced  once or twice in a century to realize the dreams of a Titian or a  Giorgione. Her complexion was clear and radiant, as of a descendant of  the Sun God. Her bright hair, if its golden ripples were shaken out,  would reach to her knees. Her face was worthy of immortality by the  pencil of a Titian. Her dark eyes drew with a magnetism which attracted  men, in spite of themselves, whithersoever she would lead them. They  were never so dangerous as when, in apparent repose, they sheathed their  fascination for a moment, and suddenly shot a backward glance, like a  Parthian arrow, from under their long eyelashes, that left a wound to be  sighed over for many a day.    The spoiled and petted child of the brave, careless Renaud d'Avesne des  Meloises, of an ancient family in the Nivernois, Angelique grew up  a motherless girl, clever above most of her companions, conscious of  superior charms, always admired and flattered, and, since she left the  Convent, worshipped as the idol of the gay gallants of the city, and the  despair and envy of her own sex. She was a born sovereign of men, and  she felt it. It was her divine right to be preferred. She trod the earth  with dainty feet, and a step aspiring as that of the fair Louise de  La Valliere when she danced in the royal ballet in the forest of  Fontainebleau and stole a king's heart by the flashes of her pretty  feet. Angelique had been indulged by her father in every caprice, and in  the gay world inhaled the incense of adulation until she regarded it as  her right, and resented passionately when it was withheld.    She was not by nature bad, although vain, selfish, and aspiring. Her  footstool was the hearts of men, and upon it she set hard her beautiful  feet, indifferent to the anguish caused by her capricious tyranny. She  was cold and calculating under the warm passions of a voluptuous nature.  Although many might believe they had won the favor, none felt sure they  had gained the love of this fair, capricious girl.        CHAPTER IV. CONFIDENCES.      Angelique took the arm of Amelie in her old, familiar schoolgirl way,  and led her to the sunny corner of a bastion where lay a dismounted  cannon.    The girls sat down upon the old gun. Angelique held Amelie by both  hands, as if hesitating how to express something she wished to say.  Still, when Angelique did speak, it was plain to Amelie that she had  other things on her mind than what her tongue gave loose to.    \"Now we are quite alone, Amelie,\" said she, \"we can talk as we used to  do in our school-days. You have not been in the city during the whole  summer, and have missed all its gaieties?\"    \"I was well content. How beautiful the country looks from here!\" replied  Amelie. \"How much pleasanter to be in it, revelling among the flowers  and under the trees! I like to touch the country as well as to look at  it from a distance, as you do in Quebec.\"    \"Well, I never care for the country if I can only get enough of the  city. Quebec was never so gay as it has been this year. The Royal  Roussillon, and the freshly arrived regiments of Bearn and Ponthieu,  have turned the heads of all Quebec,--of the girls, that is. Gallants  have been plenty as bilberries in August. And you may be sure I got my  share, Amelie.\" Angelique laughed aloud at some secret reminiscences of  her summer campaign.    \"It is well that I did not come to the city, Angelique, to get my  head turned like the rest; but now that I am here, suppose I should  mercifully try to heal some of the hearts you have broken!\"    \"I hope you won't try. Those bright eyes of yours would heal too  effectually the wounds made by mine, and that is not what I desire,\"  replied Angelique, laughing.    \"No! then your heart is more cruel than your eyes. But, tell me, who  have been your victims this year, Angelique?\"    \"Well, to be frank, Amelie, I have tried my fascinations upon the King's  officers very impartially, and with fair success. There have been  three duels, two deaths, and one captain of the Royal Roussillon turned  cordelier for my sake. Is that not a fair return for my labor?\"    \"You are shocking as ever, Angelique! I do not believe you feel proud of  such triumphs,\" exclaimed Amelie.    \"Proud, no! I am not proud of conquering men. That is easy! My triumphs  are over the women! And the way to triumph over them is to subdue  the men. You know my old rival at school, the haughty Francoise de  Lantagnac: I owed her a grudge, and she has put on the black veil for  life, instead of the white one and orange-blossoms for a day! I only  meant to frighten her, however, when I stole her lover, but she took  it to heart and went into the Convent. It was dangerous for her to  challenge Angelique des Meloises to test the fidelity of her affianced,  Julien de St. Croix.\"    Amelie rose up in honest indignation, her cheek burning like a coal of  fire. \"I know your wild talk of old, Angelique, but I will not believe  you are so wicked as to make deadly sport of our holiest affections.\"    \"Ah, if you knew men as I do, Amelie, you would think it no sin to  punish them for their perjuries.\"    \"No, I don't know men,\" replied Amelie, \"but I think a noble man is,  after God, the worthiest object of a woman's devotion. We were better  dead than finding amusement in the pain of those who love us; pray what  became of Julien de St. Croix after you broke up his intended marriage  with poor Francoise?\"    \"Oh! I threw him to the fishes! What did I care for him? It was mainly  to punish Francoise's presumption that I showed my power and made him  fight that desperate duel with Captain Le Franc.\"    \"O Angelique, how could you be so unutterably wicked?\"    \"Wicked? It was not my fault, you know, that he was killed. He was my  champion, and ought to have come off victor. I wore a black ribbon for  him a full half-year, and had the credit of being devoted to his memory;  I had my triumph in that if in nothing else.\"    \"Your triumph! for shame, Angelique! I will not listen to you: you  profane the very name of love by uttering such sentiments. The gift of  so much beauty was for blessing, not for pain. St. Mary pray for you,  Angelique: you need her prayers!\" Amelie rose up suddenly.    \"Nay, do not get angry and go off that way, Amelie,\" ejaculated  Angelique. \"I will do penance for my triumphs by relating my defeats,  and my special failure of all, which I know you will rejoice to hear.\"    \"I, Angelique? What have your triumphs or failures to do with me? No, I  care not to hear.\" Angelique held her half forcibly by the scarf.    \"But you will care when I tell you that I met an old and valued friend  of yours last night at the Castle--the new Aide-de-Camp of the Governor,  Colonel Philibert. I think I have heard you speak of Pierre Philibert in  the Convent, Amelie?\"    Amelie felt the net thrown over her by the skilful retiaria. She stood  stock-still in mute surprise, with averted eye and deeply blushing  cheek, fighting desperately with the confusion she feared to let  Angelique detect. But that keen-sighted girl saw too clearly--she had  caught her fast as a bird is caught by the fowler.    \"Yes, I met with a double defeat last night,\" continued Angelique.    \"Indeed! pray, from whom?\" Amelie's curiosity, though not usually a  troublesome quality, was by this time fairly roused.    Angelique saw her drift, and played with her anxiety for a few moments.    \"My first rebuff was from that gentlemanly philosopher from Sweden, a  great friend of the Governor, you know. But, alas, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#6)"],[1,"nemy. \"You  may kill me,\" he said after a silence. \"But I can hold you--and all the  universe for that matter--in the grip of this little brain. I would not  change. Even now.\"    He looked at the little phial. \"There will be no need of sleep again,\"  he said. The next day at noon, punctual to the minute, he entered his  lecture theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was,  and carefully selected a large piece of chalk. It was a joke among his  students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble  in his fingers, and once he had been stricken to impotence by their  hiding his supply. He came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the  rising tiers of young fresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed studied  commonness of phrasing. \"Circumstances have arisen--circumstances beyond  my control,\" he said and paused, \"which will debar me from completing  the course I had designed. It would seem, gentlemen, if I may put the  thing clearly and briefly, that--Man has lived in vain.\"    The students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad? Raised  eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces remained  intent upon his calm grey-fringed face. \"It will be interesting,\" he was  saying, \"to devote this morning to an exposition, so far as I can make  it clear to you, of the calculations that have led me to this  conclusion. Let us assume--\"    He turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the way that  was usual to him. \"What was that about 'lived in vain?'\" whispered one  student to another. \"Listen,\" said the other, nodding towards the  lecturer.    And presently they began to understand.    That night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion had  carried it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its brightness was so  great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose, and every star was  hidden in its turn, save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella,  Aldebaran, Sirius and the pointers of the Bear. It was very white and  beautiful. In many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled  it about. It was perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive sky of the  tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon.  The frost was still on the ground in England, but the world was as  brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight. One could see to read  quite ordinary print by that cold clear light, and in the cities the  lamps burnt yellow and wan.    And everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout  Christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside  like the belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous tumult grew  to a clangour in the cities. It was the tolling of the bells in a  million belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people to sleep no  more, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches and pray. And  overhead, growing larger and brighter, as the earth rolled on its way  and the night passed, rose the dazzling star.    And the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the shipyards  glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all  night long. And in all the seas about the civilised lands, ships with  throbbing engines, and ships with bellying sails, crowded with men and  living creatures, were standing out to ocean and the north. For already  the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over  the world, and translated into a hundred tongues. The new planet and  Neptune, locked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster  and faster towards the sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew  a hundred miles, and every second its terrific velocity increased. As it  flew now, indeed, it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the  earth and scarcely affect it. But near its destined path, as yet only  slightly perturbed, spun the mighty planet Jupiter and his moons  sweeping splendid round the sun. Every moment now the attraction between  the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger. And the  result of that attraction? Inevitably Jupiter would be deflected from  its orbit into an elliptical path, and the burning star, swung by his  attraction wide of its sunward rush, would \"describe a curved path\" and  perhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close to, our earth.  \"Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves, floods, and a  steady rise in temperature to I know not what limit\"--so prophesied the  master mathematician.    And overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid, blazed  the star of the coming doom.    To many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it seemed  that it was visibly approaching. And that night, too, the weather  changed, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe and France  and England softened towards a thaw.    But you must not imagine because I have spoken of people praying through  the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards  mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because  of the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the world,  and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night,  nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common  occupations. In all the cities the shops, save one here and there,  opened and closed at their proper hours, the doctor and the undertaker  plied their trades, the workers gathered in the factories, soldiers  drilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves lurked and  fled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of the newspapers  roared through the nights, and many a priest of this church and that  would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish  panic. The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000--for then,  too, people had anticipated the end. The star was no star--mere gas--a  comet; and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth. There  was no precedent for such a thing. Common sense was sturdy everywhere,  scornful, jesting, a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful.  That night, at seven-fifteen by Greenwich time, the star would be at its  nearest to Jupiter. Then the world would see the turn things would take.  The master mathematician's grim warnings were treated by many as so much  mere elaborate self-advertisement. Common sense at last, a little heated  by argument, signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed. So,  too, barbarism and savagery, already tired of the novelty, went about  their nightly business, and save for a howling dog here and there, the  beast world left the star unheeded.    And yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw the star  rise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had been the night  before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master  mathematician--to take the danger as if it had passed.    But hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew--it grew with a  terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a little  nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it had  turned night into a second day. Had it come straight to the earth  instead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it must  have leapt the intervening gulf in a day, but as it was it took five  days altogether to come by our planet. The next night it had become a  third the size of the moon before it set to English eyes, and the thaw  was assured. It rose over America near the size of the moon, but  blinding white to look at, and _hot_; and a breath of hot wind blew now  with its rising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and Brazil, and  down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently through a driving  reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning, and hail  unprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods. And upon  all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that  night, and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and  turbid, and soon--in their upper reaches--with swirling trees and the  bodies of beasts and men. They rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly  brilliance, and came trickling over their banks at last, behind the  flying population of their valleys.    And along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the tides  were higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the storms  drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole  cities. And so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of  the sun was like the coming of a shadow. The earthquakes began and grew  until all down America from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides  were sliding, fissures were opening, and houses and walls crumbling to  destruction. The whole side of Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast  convulsion, and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift  and liquid that in one day it reached the sea.    So the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the Pacific,  trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the growing tidal  wave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager, poured over island and  island and swept them clear of men. Until that wave came at last--in a  blinding light and with the breath of a furnace, swift and terrible it  came--a wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring hungrily, upon the long  coasts of Asia, and swept inland across the plains of China. For a space  the star, hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its  strength, showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country;  towns and villages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated  fields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the  incandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the murmur of the  flood. And thus it was with millions of men that night--a flight"]]]
