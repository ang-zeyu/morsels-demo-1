Some there were of course who, having achieved distinction  in various walks of life, were further honoured by a resting-place within  the chancel.  The whole interior was full of records of the family.  Squire Norman was fond of coming to the place; and often from the very  beginning had taken Stephen with him.  One of her earliest recollections  was kneeling down with her father, who held her hand in his, whilst with  the other he wiped the tears from his eyes, before a tomb sculptured  beautifully in snowy marble.  She never forgot the words he had said to  her:    'You will always remember, darling, that your dear mother rests in this  sacred place.  When I am gone, if you are ever in any trouble come here.  Come alone and open out your heart.  You need never fear to ask God for  help at the grave of your mother!'  The child had been impressed, as had  been many and many another of her race.  For seven hundred years each  child of the house of Norman had been brought alone by either parent and  had heard some such words.  The custom had come to be almost a family  ritual, and it never failed to leave its impress in greater or lesser  degree.    Whenever Harold had in the early days paid a visit to Normanstand, the  church had generally been an objective of their excursions.  He was  always delighted to go.  His love for his own ancestry made him admire  and respect that of others; so that Stephen's enthusiasm in the matter  was but another cord to bind him to her.    In one of their excursions they found the door into the crypt open; and  nothing would do Stephen but that they should enter it.  To-day, however,  they had no light; but they arranged that on the morrow they would bring  candles with them and explore the place thoroughly.  The afternoon of the  next day saw them at the door of the crypt with a candle, which Harold  proceeded to light.  Stephen looked on admiringly, and said in a half-  conscious way, the half-consciousness being shown in the implication:    'You are not afraid of the crypt?'    'Not a bit!  In my father's church there was a crypt, and I was in it  several times.'  As he spoke the memory of the last time he had been  there swept over him.  He seemed to see again the many lights, held in  hands that were never still, making a grim gloom where the black shadows  were not; to hear again the stamp and hurried shuffle of the many feet,  as the great oak coffin was borne by the struggling mass of men down the  steep stairway and in through the narrow door . . . And then the hush  when voices faded away; and the silence seemed a real thing, as for a  while he stood alone close to the dead father who had been all in all to  him.  And once again he seemed to feel the recall to the living world of  sorrow and of light, when his inert hand was taken in the strong loving  one of Squire Norman.    He paused and drew back.    'Why don't you go on?' she asked, surprised.    He did not like to tell her then.  Somehow, it seemed out of place.  He  had often spoken to her of his father, and she had always been a  sympathetic listener; but here, at the entrance of the grim vault, he did  not wish to pain her with his own thoughts of sorrow and all the terrible  memories which the similarity of the place evoked.  And even whilst he  hesitated there came to him a thought so laden with pain and fear that he  rejoiced at the pause which gave it to him in time.  It was in that very  crypt that Stephen's mother had been buried, and had they two gone in, as  they had intended, the girl might have seen her mother's coffin as he had  seen his father's, but under circumstances which made him shiver.  He had  been, as he said, often in the crypt at Carstone; and well he knew the  sordidness of the chamber of death.  His imagination was alive as well as  his memory; he shuddered, not for himself, but for Stephen.  How could he  allow the girl to suffer in such a way as she might, as she infallibly  would, if it were made apparent to her in such a brutal way?  How  pitiful, how meanly pitiful, is the aftermath of death.  Well he  remembered how many a night he woke in an agony, thinking of how his  father lay in that cold, silent, dust-strewn vault, in the silence and  the dark, with never a ray of light or hope or love!  Gone, abandoned,  forgotten by all, save perhaps one heart which bled . . . He would save  little Stephen, if he could, from such a memory.  He would not give any  reason for refusing to go in.    He blew out the candle, and turned the key in the lock, took it out, and  put it in his pocket.    'Come, Stephen!' he said, 'let us go somewhere else.  We will not go into  the crypt to-day!'    'Why not?'  The lips that spoke were pouted mutinously and the face was  flushed.  The imperious little lady was not at all satisfied to give up  the cherished project.  For a whole day and night she had, whilst waking,  thought of the coming adventure; the thrill of it was not now to be  turned to cold disappointment without even an explanation.  She did not  think that Harold was afraid; that would be ridiculous.  But she  wondered; and mysteries always annoyed her.  She did not like to be at  fault, more especially when other people knew.  All the pride in her  revolted.    'Why not?' she repeated more imperiously still.    Harold said kindly:    'Because, Stephen, there is really a good reason.  Don't ask me, for I  can't tell you.  You must take it from me that I am right.  You know,  dear, that I wouldn't willingly disappoint you; and I know that you had  set your heart on this.  But indeed, indeed I have a good reason.'    Stephen was really angry now.  She was amenable to reason, though she did  not consciously know what reason was; but to accept some one else's  reason blindfold was repugnant to her nature, even at her then age.  She  was about to speak angrily, but looking up she saw that Harold's mouth  was set with marble firmness.  So, after her manner, she acquiesced in  the inevitable and said:    'All right!  Harold.'    But in the inner recesses of her firm-set mind was a distinct intention  to visit the vault when more favourable circumstances would permit.          CHAPTER V--THE CRYPT      It was some weeks before Stephen got the chance she wanted.  She knew it  would be difficult to evade Harold's observation, for the big boy's  acuteness as to facts had impressed itself on her.  It was strange that  out of her very trust in Harold came a form of distrust in others.  In  the little matter of evading him she inclined to any one in whom there  was his opposite, in whose reliability she instinctively mistrusted.  'There is nothing bad or good but thinking makes it so!'  To enter that  crypt, which had seemed so small a matter at first, had now in process of  thinking and wishing and scheming become a thing to be much desired.  Harold saw, or rather felt, that something was in the girl's mind, and  took for granted that it had something to do with the crypt.  But he  thought it better not to say anything lest he should keep awake a desire  which he hoped would die naturally.    One day it was arranged that Harold should go over to Carstone to see the  solicitor who had wound up his father's business.  He was to stay the  night and ride back next day.  Stephen, on hearing of the arrangement, so  contrived matters that Master Everard, the son of a banker who had  recently purchased an estate in the neighbourhood, was asked to come to  play with her on the day when Harold left.  It was holiday time at Eton,  and he was at home.  Stephen did not mention to Harold the fact of his  coming; it was only from a chance allusion of Mrs. Jarrold before he went  that he inferred it.  He did not think the matter of sufficient  importance to wonder why Stephen, who generally told him everything, had  not mentioned this.    During their play, Stephen, after pledging him to secrecy, told Leonard  of her intention of visiting the crypt, and asked him to help her in it.  This was an adventure, and as such commended itself to the schoolboy  heart.  He entered at once into the scheme con amore; and the two  discussed ways and means.  Leonard's only regret was that he was  associated with a little girl in such a project.  It was something of a  blow to his personal vanity, which was a large item in his moral  equipment, that such a project should have been initiated by the girl and  not by himself.  He was to get possession of the key and in the forenoon  of the next day he was to be waiting in the churchyard, when Stephen  would join him as soon as she could evade her nurse.  She was now more  than eleven, and had less need of being watched than in her earlier  years.  It was possible, with strategy, to get away undiscovered for an  hour.    * * * * *    At Carstone Harold got though what he had to do that same afternoon and  arranged to start early in the morning for Normanstand.  After an early  breakfast he set out on his thirty-mile journey at eight o'clock.  Littlejohn, his horse, was in excellent form, notwithstanding his long  journey of the day before, and with his nose pointed for home, put his  best foot foremost.  Harold felt in great spirits.  The long ride the day  before had braced him physically, though there were on his journey times  of great sadness when the thought of his father came back to him and the  sense of loss was renewed with each thought of his old home.  But youth  is naturally buoyant.  His visit to the church, the first thing on his  arrival at Carstone, and his kneeling before the stone made sacred to his  father's memory, though it entailed a silent gush of tears, did him good,  and even seemed to place his sorrow farther away.  When he came again in  the morning before leaving Carstone there were no tears.  There was only  a holy memory which seemed to sanctify loss; and his father seemed nearer  to him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#6)"],[1,"enomenal, the  soul gains experience, and is prepared for liberation. In other words,  the whole outer world exists for the purposes of the soul, and finds in  this its true reason for being.    19. The grades or layers of the Three Potencies are the defined, the  undefined, that with distinctive mark, that without distinctive mark.    Or, as we might say, there are two strata of the physical, and two  strata of the psychical realms. In each, there is the side of form, and  the side of force. The form side of the physical is here called the  defined. The force side of the physical is the undefined, that which has  no boundaries. So in the psychical; there is the form side; that with  distinctive marks, such as the characteristic features of mind-images;  and there is the force side, without distinctive marks, such as the  forces of desire or fear, which may flow now to this mind-image, now  to that.    20. The Seer is pure vision. Though pure, he looks out through the  vesture of the mind.    The Seer, as always, is the spiritual man whose deepest consciousness  is pure vision, the pure life of the eternal. But the spiritual man, as yet  unseeing in his proper person, looks out on the world through the eyes  of the psychical man, by whom he is enfolded and enmeshed. The task  is, to set this prisoner free, to clear the dust of ages from this buried  temple.    21. The very essence of things seen is, that they exist for the Seer.    The things of outer life, not only material things, but the psychic man  also, exist in very deed for the purposes of the Seer, the Soul, the  spiritual man Disaster comes, when the psychical man sets up, so to  speak, on his own account, trying to live for himself alone, and taking  material things to solace his loneliness.    22. Though fallen away from him who has reached the goal, things  seen have not alto fallen away, since they still exist for others.    When one of us conquers hate, hate does not thereby cease out of the  world, since others still hate and suffer hatred. So with other  delusions, which hold us in bondage to material things, and through  which we look at all material things. When the coloured veil of illusion  is gone, the world which we saw through it is also gone, for now we  see life as it is, in the white radiance of eternity. But for others the  coloured veil remains, and therefore the world thus coloured by it  remains for them, and will remain till they, too, conquer delusion.    23. The association of the Seer with things seen is the cause of the  realizing of the nature of things seen, and also of the realizing of the  nature of the Seer.    Life is educative. All life's infinite variety is for discipline, for the  development of the soul. So passing through many lives, the Soul  learns the secrets of the world, the august laws that are written in the  form of the snow-crystal or the majestic order of the stars. Yet all  these laws are but reflections, but projections outward, of the laws of  the soul; therefore in learning these, the soul learns to know itself. All  life is but the mirror wherein the Soul learns to know its own face.    24. The cause of this association is the darkness of unwisdom.    The darkness of unwisdom is the absorption of consciousness in the  personal life, and in the things seen by the personal life. This is the  fall, through which comes experience, the learning of the lessons of  life. When they are learned, the day of redemption is at hand.    25. The bringing of this association to an end, by bringing the  darkness of unwisdom to an end, is the great liberation; this is the  Seer's attainment of his own pure being.    When the spiritual man has, through the psychical, learned all life's  lessons, the time has come for him to put off the veil and disguise of  the psychical and to stand revealed a King, in the house of the Father.  So shall he enter into his kingdom, and go no more out.    26. A discerning which is carried on without wavering is the means of  liberation.    Here we come close to the pure Vedanta, with its discernment  between the eternal and the temporal. St. Paul, following after Philo  and Plato, lays down the same fundamental principle: the things seen  are temporal, the things unseen are eternal.    Patanjali means something more than an intellectual assent, though  this too is vital. He has in view a constant discriminating in act as well  as thought; of the two ways which present themselves for every deed  or choice, always to choose the higher way, that which makes for the  things eternal: honesty rather than roguery, courage and not  cowardice, the things of another rather than one's own, sacrifice and  not indulgence. This true discernment, carried out constantly, makes  for liberation.    27. His illuminations is sevenfold, rising In successive stages.    Patanjali's text does not tell us what the seven stages of this  illumination are. The commentator thus describes them:    First, the danger to be escaped is recognized; it need not be  recognized a second time. Second, the causes of the danger to be  escaped are worn away; they need not be worn away a second time.  Third, the way of escape is clearly perceived, by the contemplation  which checks psychic perturbation. Fourth, the means of escape, clear  discernment, has been developed. This is the fourfold release  belonging to insight. The final release from the psychic is three-fold:  As fifth of the seven degrees, the dominance of its thinking is ended;  as sixth, its potencies, like rocks from a precipice, fall of themselves;  once dissolved, they do not grow again. Then, as seventh, freed from  these potencies, the spiritual man stands forth in his own nature as  purity and light. Happy is the spiritual man who beholds this  seven-fold illumination in its ascending stages.    28. From steadfastly following after the means of Yoga, until impurity  is worn away, there comes the illumination of thought up to full  discernment.    Here, we enter on the more detailed practical teaching of Patanjali,  with its sound and luminous good sense. And when we come to detail  the means of Yoga, we may well be astonished at their simplicity.  There is little in them that is mysterious. They are very familiar. The  essence of the matter lies in carrying them out.    29. The eight means of Yoga are: the Commandments, the Rules,  right Poise, right Control of the life-force, Withdrawal, Attention,  Meditation, Contemplation.    These eight means are to be followed in their order, in the sense which  will immediately be made clear. We can get a ready understanding of  the first two by comparing them with the Commandments which must  be obeyed by all good citizens, and the Rules which are laid on the  members of religious orders. Until one has fulfilled the first, it is  futile to concern oneself with the second. And so with all the means of  Yoga. They must be taken in their order.    30. The Commandments are these: nom injury, truthfulness, abstaining  from stealing, from impurity, from covetousness.    These five precepts are almost exactly the same as the Buddhist  Commandments: not to kill, not to steal, not to be guilty of  incontinence, not to drink intoxicants, to speak the truth. Almost  identical is St. Paul's list: Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt  not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet. And in the same  spirit is the answer made to the young map having great possessions,  who asked, What shall I do to be saved? and received the reply: Keep  the Commandments.    This broad, general training, which forms and develops human  character, must be accomplished to a very considerable degree, before  there can be much hope of success in the further stages of spiritual  life. First the psychical, and then the spiritual. First the man, then the  angel. On this broad, humane and wise foundation does the system of  Patanjali rest.    31. The Commandments, not limited to any race, place, time or  occasion, universal, are the great obligation.    The Commandments form the broad general training of humanity.  Each one of them rests on a universal, spiritual law. Each one of them  expresses an attribute or aspect of the Self, the Eternal; when we  violate one of the Commandments, we set ourselves against the law  and being of the Eternal, thereby bringing ourselves to inevitable con  fusion. So the first steps in spiritual life must be taken by bringing  ourselves into voluntary obedience to these spiritual laws and thus  making ourselves partakers of the spiritual powers, the being of the  Eternal Like the law of gravity, the need of air to breathe, these great  laws know no exceptions They are in force in all lands, throughout al  times, for all mankind.    32. The Rules are these: purity, serenity fervent aspiration, spiritual  reading, and per feet obedience to the Master.    Here we have a finer law, one which humanity as a whole is less ready  for, less fit to obey. Yet we can see that these Rules are the same in  essence as the Commandments, but on a higher, more spiritual plane.  The Commandments may be obeyed in outer acts and abstinences; the  Rules demand obedience of the heart and spirit, a far more awakened  and more positive consciousness. The Rules are the spiritual  counterpart of the Commandments, and they have finer degrees, for  more advanced spiritual growth.    33. When transgressions hinder, the weight of the imagination should  be thrown' on the opposite side.    Let us take a simple case, that of a thief, a habitual criminal, who has  drifted into stealing in childhood, before the moral consciousness has  awakened. We may imprison such a thief, and deprive him of all  possibility of further theft, or of using the divine gift of will. Or we  may recognize his disadvantages, and help him gradually to build up  possessions which express his will, and draw forth his self-respect. If  we imagine that, after he has"]]]
