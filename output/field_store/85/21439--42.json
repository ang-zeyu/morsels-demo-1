OEDIPUS  This and none other is my constant dread.    MESSENGER  Dost thou not know thy fears are baseless all?    OEDIPUS  How baseless, if I am their very son?    MESSENGER  Since Polybus was naught to thee in blood.    OEDIPUS  What say'st thou? was not Polybus my sire?    MESSENGER  As much thy sire as I am, and no more.    OEDIPUS  My sire no more to me than one who is naught?    MESSENGER  Since I begat thee not, no more did he.    OEDIPUS  What reason had he then to call me son?    MESSENGER  Know that he took thee from my hands, a gift.    OEDIPUS  Yet, if no child of his, he loved me well.    MESSENGER  A childless man till then, he warmed to thee.    OEDIPUS  A foundling or a purchased slave, this child?    MESSENGER  I found thee in Cithaeron's wooded glens.    OEDIPUS  What led thee to explore those upland glades?    MESSENGER  My business was to tend the mountain flocks.    OEDIPUS  A vagrant shepherd journeying for hire?    MESSENGER  True, but thy savior in that hour, my son.    OEDIPUS  My savior? from what harm? what ailed me then?    MESSENGER  Those ankle joints are evidence enow.    OEDIPUS  Ah, why remind me of that ancient sore?    MESSENGER  I loosed the pin that riveted thy feet.    OEDIPUS  Yes, from my cradle that dread brand I bore.    MESSENGER  Whence thou deriv'st the name that still is thine.    OEDIPUS  Who did it?  I adjure thee, tell me who  Say, was it father, mother?    MESSENGER                                I know not.  The man from whom I had thee may know more.    OEDIPUS  What, did another find me, not thyself?    MESSENGER  Not I; another shepherd gave thee me.    OEDIPUS  Who was he?  Would'st thou know again the man?    MESSENGER  He passed indeed for one of Laius' house.    OEDIPUS  The king who ruled the country long ago?    MESSENGER  The same:  he was a herdsman of the king.    OEDIPUS  And is he living still for me to see him?    MESSENGER  His fellow-countrymen should best know that.    OEDIPUS  Doth any bystander among you know  The herd he speaks of, or by seeing him  Afield or in the city? answer straight!  The hour hath come to clear this business up.    CHORUS  Methinks he means none other than the hind  Whom thou anon wert fain to see; but that  Our queen Jocasta best of all could tell.    OEDIPUS  Madam, dost know the man we sent to fetch?  Is the same of whom the stranger speaks?    JOCASTA  Who is the man?  What matter?  Let it be.  'Twere waste of thought to weigh such idle words.    OEDIPUS  No, with such guiding clues I cannot fail  To bring to light the secret of my birth.    JOCASTA  Oh, as thou carest for thy life, give o'er  This quest.  Enough the anguish _I_ endure.    OEDIPUS  Be of good cheer; though I be proved the son  Of a bondwoman, aye, through three descents  Triply a slave, thy honor is unsmirched.    JOCASTA  Yet humor me, I pray thee; do not this.    OEDIPUS  I cannot; I must probe this matter home.    JOCASTA  'Tis for thy sake I advise thee for the best.    OEDIPUS  I grow impatient of this best advice.    JOCASTA  Ah mayst thou ne'er discover who thou art!    OEDIPUS  Go, fetch me here the herd, and leave yon woman  To glory in her pride of ancestry.    JOCASTA  O woe is thee, poor wretch!  With that last word  I leave thee, henceforth silent evermore.  [Exit JOCASTA]    CHORUS  Why, Oedipus, why stung with passionate grief  Hath the queen thus departed?  Much I fear  From this dead calm will burst a storm of woes.    OEDIPUS  Let the storm burst, my fixed resolve still holds,  To learn my lineage, be it ne'er so low.  It may be she with all a woman's pride  Thinks scorn of my base parentage.  But I  Who rank myself as Fortune's favorite child,  The giver of good gifts, shall not be shamed.  She is my mother and the changing moons  My brethren, and with them I wax and wane.  Thus sprung why should I fear to trace my birth?  Nothing can make me other than I am.    CHORUS  (Str.)  If my soul prophetic err not, if my wisdom aught avail,            Thee, Cithaeron, I shall hail,  As the nurse and foster-mother of our Oedipus shall greet  Ere tomorrow's full moon rises, and exalt thee as is meet.  Dance and song shall hymn thy praises, lover of our royal race.            Phoebus, may my words find grace!    (Ant.)  Child,  who bare thee, nymph or goddess? sure thy sure was  more  than  man,            Haply the hill-roamer Pan.  Of did Loxias beget thee, for he haunts the upland wold;  Or Cyllene's lord, or Bacchus, dweller on the hilltops cold?  Did some Heliconian Oread give him thee, a new-born joy?            Nymphs with whom he love to toy?    OEDIPUS  Elders, if I, who never yet before  Have met the man, may make a guess, methinks  I see the herdsman who we long have sought;  His time-worn aspect matches with the years  Of yonder aged messenger; besides  I seem to recognize the men who bring him  As servants of my own.  But you, perchance,  Having in past days known or seen the herd,  May better by sure knowledge my surmise.    CHORUS  I recognize him; one of Laius' house;  A simple hind, but true as any man.  [Enter HERDSMAN.]    OEDIPUS  Corinthian, stranger, I address thee first,  Is this the man thou meanest!    MESSENGER                                This is he.    OEDIPUS  And now old man, look up and answer all  I ask thee.  Wast thou once of Laius' house?    HERDSMAN  I was, a thrall, not purchased but home-bred.    OEDIPUS  What was thy business? how wast thou employed?    HERDSMAN  The best part of my life I tended sheep.    OEDIPUS  What were the pastures thou didst most frequent?    HERDSMAN  Cithaeron and the neighboring alps.    OEDIPUS                                     Then there  Thou must have known yon man, at least by fame?    HERDSMAN  Yon man? in what way? what man dost thou mean?    OEDIPUS  The man here, having met him in past times...    HERDSMAN  Off-hand I cannot call him well to mind.    MESSENGER  No wonder, master.  But I will revive  His blunted memories.  Sure he can recall  What time together both we drove our flocks,  He two, I one, on the Cithaeron range,  For three long summers; I his mate from spring  Till rose Arcturus; then in winter time  I led mine home, he his to Laius' folds.  Did these things happen as I say, or no?    HERDSMAN  'Tis long ago, but all thou say'st is true.    MESSENGER  Well, thou mast then remember giving me  A child to rear as my own foster-son?    HERDSMAN  Why dost thou ask this question?  What of that?    MESSENGER  Friend, he that stands before thee was that child.    HERDSMAN  A plague upon thee!  Hold thy wanton tongue!    OEDIPUS  Softly, old man, rebuke him not; thy words  Are more deserving chastisement than his.    HERDSMAN  O best of masters, what is my offense?    OEDIPUS  Not answering what he asks about the child.    HERDSMAN  He speaks at random, babbles like a fool.    OEDIPUS  If thou lack'st grace to speak, I'll loose thy tongue.    HERDSMAN  For mercy's sake abuse not an old man.    OEDIPUS  Arrest the villain, seize and pinion him!    HERDSMAN  Alack, alack!  What have I done? what wouldst thou further learn?    OEDIPUS  Didst give this man the child of whom he asks?    HERDSMAN  I did; and would that I had died that day!    OEDIPUS  And die thou shalt unless thou tell the truth.    HERDSMAN  But, if I tell it, I am doubly lost.    OEDIPUS  The knave methinks will still prevaricate.    HERDSMAN  Nay, I confessed I gave it long ago.    OEDIPUS  Whence came it? was it thine, or given to thee?    HERDSMAN  I had it from another, 'twas not mine.    OEDIPUS  From whom of these our townsmen, and what house?    HERDSMAN  Forbear for God's sake, master, ask no more.    OEDIPUS  If I must question thee again, thou'rt lost.    HERDSMAN  Well then--it was a child of Laius' house.    OEDIPUS  Slave-born or one of Laius' own race?    HERDSMAN  Ah me!  I stand upon the perilous edge of speech.    OEDIPUS  And I of hearing, but I still must hear.    HERDSMAN  Know then the child was by repute his own,  But she within, thy consort best could tell.    OEDIPUS  What! she, she gave it thee?    HERDSMAN                                'Tis so, my king.    OEDIPUS  With what intent?    HERDSMAN                      To make away with it.    OEDIPUS  What, she its mother.    HERDSMAN                      Fearing a dread weird.    OEDIPUS  What weird?    HERDSMAN            'Twas told that he should slay his sire.    OEDIPUS  What didst thou give it then to this old man?    HERDSMAN  Through pity, master, for the babe.  I thought  He'd take it to the country whence he came;  But he preserved it for the worst of woes.  For if thou art in sooth what this man saith,  God pity thee! thou wast to misery born.    OEDIPUS  Ah me! ah me! all brought to pass, all true!  O light, may I behold thee nevermore!  I stand a wretch, in birth, in wedlock cursed,  A parricide, incestuously, triply cursed!  [Exit OEDIPUS]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)            Races of mortal man            Whose life is but a span,  I count ye but the shadow of a shade!            For he who most doth know            Of bliss, hath but the show;  A moment, and the visions pale and fade.  Thy fall, O Oedipus, thy piteous fall  Warns me none born of women blest to call.    (Ant. 1)            For he of marksmen best,            O Zeus, outshot the rest,  And won the prize supreme of wealth and power.            By him the vulture maid            Was quelled, her witchery laid;  He rose our savior and the land's strong tower.  We hailed thee king and from that day adored  Of mighty Thebes the universal lord.    (Str. 2)            O heavy hand of fate!            Who now more desolate,  Whose tale more sad than thine, whose lot more dire?

If this judgment be correct and if the relatively  unworn dentition (category 3) means that these animals are young of the  year, we must conclude that individuals born in early summer may molt  from juvenal to postjuvenal, then to adult pelage, and finally in the  autumn into another adult pelage. Other individuals, six in number and  of categories 2 and 3, are simultaneously completing the juvenal to  postjuvenal molt and beginning the postjuvenal to adult molt. The  juvenal to postjuvenal molt begins, as has been described by various  authors, along the lateral line and proceeds dorsally and ventrally and  anteriorly and posteriorly, and the last patch to lose the gray juvenal  color is the top of head and nape, or less frequently the rump. In some  individuals a gray patch on the nape remained but emerging hair was not  apparent; perhaps the molt had been halted just prior to completion. The  progressing band of emerging hair is narrow in most specimens but in  some up to one-fifth of the circumference of the body has hair at the  same degree of emergence. Subsequent molts, both from postjuvenal to  adult pelage and between adult pelages, are less regular in point, or  points, of origin, width of progressing molt, and amount of surface  molting at one time. Half or more of the dorsum is oftentimes involved  in the same stage of molt at once. In some specimens the molt begins  along the lateral line, and in others in several centers on the sides.  In some skins distinct lines of molt are visible without parting the  hair, and in some others the molt is patchy in appearance. Growth of new  hair is apparent at various times of the year as a result of injury such  as that caused by bot fly larvae, cuts, scratches, or bites of other  mice. Abrasion, wear, irritation by ectoparasites, and other kinds of  injury to the skin may play a part in the development of a patchy molt.  Both breeding and molting are sources of considerable stress, and the  delay of the peak of molting activity until November when breeding  activity has decreased seems of benefit to the mice. A change in the  ratio of young mice (categories 1, 2, and 3) to old mice (categories 4  and 5) between August and November was noted. In August, 29 per cent of  the population is composed of old mice, and in November only 6 per cent.  This change results from birth of young as well as death of old mice,  but may indicate that a mouse in November has less than one chance in  ten of being alive the following November. Some females born early in  the reproductive season breed in their first summer or autumn. For  example, a female of category 2, taken on August 12, and probably in  postjuvenal pelage, had placental scars. Undoubtedly the young of the  year contribute to the breeding population, especially late in the  season.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Frequency distributions, according to size, of  _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_ in three  samples taken in August, September, and November. Sexes and pregnancy or  nonpregnancy of females are indicated. See discussion in text.]    In Figure 3 the proportion of females bearing embryos in August,  September, and November is shown. Of the females trapped in August, 11  of 32 that were more than 144 mm. in total length contained embryos; an  additional 14 females were lactating or possessed placental scars or  enlarged uteri. Therefore, approximately 80 per cent of the larger  females were reproducing in August. In September two females were  pregnant and an additional sixteen of the 44 females examined showed  other evidence of reproduction; these eighteen females make up 41 per  cent of those more than 144 mm. in total length. The only reproductive  data available for November pertain to the presence or absence of  embryos. No female was pregnant although 35 females more than 144 mm. in  total length were examined. Some of the skins show prominent mammae  indicative of recent nursing, and juveniles less than a month old were  taken. The reproductive activity of deer mice on the Mesa Verde seems to  be greatly reduced in autumn.      Peromyscus difficilis nasutus (J.A. Allen) Rock Mouse         _Specimen_: 1 mi. NNW Rock Springs, 7600 ft., 69413, a young       individual completing the molt from juvenal to postjuvenal pelage.      Peromyscus truei truei (Shufeldt) Pinyon Mouse         _Specimens examined._--Total, 42: North end Mesa Verde National       Park, 7000 ft., 76220-76232; Far View Ruins, 7700 ft., 69326-69327,       79222, and 8 uncatalogued specimens in preservative; Far View       Point, 76532-76535; Far View House, 7700 ft., 74416 MVZ; 1/2 mi.

In August three females were pregnant or lactating, or both. None of  seven adult females taken in November was pregnant.      Neotoma cinerea arizonae Merriam Bushy-tailed Wood Rat         _Specimen_: Head of Prater Canyon, MV 7873/507. Another, in the       Denver Museum, from Spruce Tree House, was reported by Finley       (1958:270).    _Neotoma cinerea_ prefers vertical crevices in high cliffs but occupies  other areas.      Neotoma mexicana inopinata Goldman Mexican Wood Rat         _Specimens examined._--Total, 10: Headquarters, MV 7890/507 and       probably 7861/507, 74421 MVZ; Spruce Tree Lodge, 6950 ft.,       34802-34803; Spruce Tree House, 74419-74420 MVZ; Square Tower       House, MV 7869/507; Cliff Palace, 74422 MVZ; Balcony House, MV       7868/507.    The Mexican wood rat is the most common species of wood rat on the Mesa  Verde. The two specimens from Spruce Tree Lodge obtained by R.B. Finley  on September 2, 1949, are young individuals.         Another species of the genus, the white-throated wood rat, _Neotoma       albigula_, may occur within the Park, since three specimens       (34757-34759) from the Mesa Verde were trapped on September 15,       1949, by R.B. Finley, approximately 4-1/2 miles south of the Park       [6 mi. E, 17 mi. S Cortez, 5600 ft.--south of the area shown in       Figure 2]. Finley (1958:450) stated that at that locality he       trapped _Neotoma mexicana_ [No. 34801], that _N. albigula_ was       perhaps more common there than _N. mexicana_, that dens of _N.       albigula_ were more common than those of _N. mexicana_ under large       rocks in the talus on the south slope of the Mesa, and that dens of       _N. mexicana_ seemed to be more numerous in crevices of ledges in       the bedrock and cliffs.      Ondatra zibethicus osoyoosensis (Lord) Muskrat    D. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) reported that he has seen  muskrat tracks many times along the Mancos River. He also relates a  report received from Chief Ranger Wade and D.A. Spencer who saw a  muskrat, no doubt a wanderer, on the Knife Edge Road on a cold winter  night. These men, both reliable observers, stopped and saw the muskrat  at a distance of two feet, where it took shelter under a power shovel  parked beside the road. Reports of dens seen along the Mancos River are  available for 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947.      Microtus longicaudus mordax (Merriam) Long-tailed Vole         _Specimens examined._--Total, 36: North end Mesa Verde National       Park, 7000 ft., 76233-76237; entrance to Mesa Verde National Park,       5123-5126 in Denver Museum; Prater Canyon, 7600 ft., 76238-76244;       Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69441; Morfield Canyon, 7600       ft., 76245-76259, 76261-76263; west bank Mancos River, northeast       side Mesa Verde National Park, 76260.    The vegetation at the above-named localities is a combination of brush  and grasses that are both more luxuriant than in areas dominated by  pinyon and juniper on the more southern and altitudinally lower part of  the top of the Mesa where no _M. longicaudus_ was taken.      Microtus mexicanus mogollonensis (Mearns) Mexican Vole         _Specimens examined._--Total, 22: Prater Canyon, 7600 ft.,       76283-76287; Sect. 27, head of east fork of Navajo Canyon, 7900       ft., 69442; Far View Ruins, 7700 ft., 69443, 79223-79224; 2 mi. NNW       Rock Springs, 7900 ft., 69444-69446; Park Well, 7450 ft.,       69447-69453; rock ledge at head of Spruce Tree Canyon, unnumbered       specimen in Denver Museum; Headquarters, MV 7895/507, 7896/507.    The first specimen of the Mexican vole from Colorado was obtained on the  Mesa Verde and has been reported by Rodeck and Anderson (1956:436).  Specimens have now been taken at seven localities on the Mesa. Prater  Canyon is the only one of these localities at which any other species of  vole was taken. There _Microtus longicaudus_ and _Microtus montanus_  were also obtained. Judging from the vegetation at the above localities,  _M. mexicanus_ is to be expected in drier areas with less cover than _M.  montanus_ inhabits, and in areas having less cover than those inhabited  by _M. longicaudus_.      Microtus montanus fusus Hall Montane Vole         _Specimens examined._--Total, 16: Upper Well, 7575 ft.,       69454-69465; 1/4 mi. N Middle Well, 7500 ft., 69466-69469.    The voles were trapped in the dry but dense meadow of grass and sedge  covering the floor of the canyon (see Plate 1). _Sorex vagrans_ was  trapped in the same places. Four of the females of _M. montanus_ trapped  on September 3, 1956, were pregnant.      Erethizon dorsatum couesi Mearns Porcupine         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: 69470, old [Female], and 69471,       her young male offspring, both obtained on August 28, 1956, in the       canyon of the Mancos River, 6200 feet, along the western side of       the River.    I saw no other porcupine in the Park.    In 1935, C.W. Quaintance took special notice of porcupines because of  the possibility, then being considered,"]]]
