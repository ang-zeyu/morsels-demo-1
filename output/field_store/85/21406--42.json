Remove the  crusts, lay a crisp lettuce leaf on one half the buttered slices, spread  with sandwich dressing and cover with a slice of buttered bread. Press  the two together and cut into triangles. Cress, Romaine, or bleached  chicory may be used in place of lettuce. These are more appetizing than  ordinary bread and butter sandwiches, and are made from materials found  in every household.      Farmer's Egg Sandwiches    Put six eggs into warm water, bring to a boil and keep at boiling point,  without boiling hard, for a half hour. Throw them into cold water,  remove the shells and cut them into slices lengthwise. A very fine wire  is best for cutting eggs. Butter the slices on the loaf, then cut them  off, cover with slices of hard-boiled eggs, dust lightly with salt and  pepper. Spread the eggs carefully with sandwich dressing, put on another  slice of buttered bread, press the two together and cut into triangles.  If you have lettuce or cress put a leaf over the dressing.      Deviled Beef Sandwiches    Chop remains of cold cooked beef very fine. To each pint add one  tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a dash of cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of  melted butter, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a half teaspoonful  of paprika and a tablespoonful of onion juice. Rub to a paste and put  between thin slices of buttered bread, trim off the crusts and cut into  triangles.      Corned Beef Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold cooked corned beef to make a pint. Add to it a  teaspoonful of horseradish, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter or  olive oil and four or five tablespoonfuls of finely-shredded water  cress. Put this between slices of buttered whole wheat or brown bread;  trim the crusts and cut into triangles.      Plain Corned Beef Sandwiches    Butter an equal quantity of white and whole wheat bread. Cut the cooked  corned beef into very thin slices. Put a slice on a slice of buttered  bread, put on top a teaspoonful of creamed horseradish sauce, spread it  out, cover with cress leaves, or crisp lettuce leaf, put on a slice of  whole wheat bread, press the two together, trim the crusts and cut into  fingers about one inch wide.    To make the creamed horseradish sauce, stir thick, dry whipped cream  into dry horseradish. If the horseradish is in vinegar, press out the  vinegar and then fold in the whipped cream.      Sandwiches à la Stanley    Cut cold beef loaf or roll into very thin slices. Bake three or four  bananas, and make a creamed horseradish sauce according to preceding  recipe. Butter white or whole wheat bread, put on first a slice of meat,  then just a thin layer of the mashed baked banana, then a teaspoonful of  horseradish sauce, and another slice of bread. Press together, trim the  crusts, cut into triangles and serve. These sandwiches should be served  soon after they are made.      English Salt-Beef Sandwiches    Whip a half cupful of cream until it is very stiff. Put four  tablespoonfuls of freshly grated horseradish or horseradish pressed free  from vinegar into a bowl, add the yolk of an egg and a saltspoonful of  salt; mix and fold in the whipped cream. Have ready very thin slices of  cold boiled salt beef. Butter thin slices of bread, put on a layer of  salt beef, then a thin layer of the horseradish sauce and another layer  of buttered bread. Press together, trim the crusts and cut into  triangles.      Sandwiches à la Bernhardt    Chop sufficient very rare cold roasted beef to make a half pint; mix  with it a dash of cayenne, a half teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful  of tomato catsup, a tablespoonful of mango chutney, two shallots, a half  clove of garlic and a tablespoonful of olive oil. Spread this on a thin  slice of buttered brown bread, cover it with leaves of cress, and then  put on another thin slice of buttered white bread. Press the two  together, cut into crescents or triangles.      East Indian Lentil Sandwiches    Take any left-over boiled or stewed lentils and press them through a  sieve. To each half cupful of this mixture add a half cupful of chopped  pecans, a level teaspoonful of curry and a saltspoonful of salt. Spread  thin slices of brown bread with butter, then put over a thick layer of  this mixture and cover with chopped parsley. Cover with another layer of  brown bread, press together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.      Nut-Butter Sandwiches    Mix one glass of nut butter with two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and one  tablespoonful of chopped pimientos. Spread this on a slice of unbuttered  brown bread, cover with finely-chopped cress or shredded lettuce, place  on top a slice of buttered bread, press the two together, trim the  crusts and cut into fingers an inch wide.      Filipino Sandwiches    Add one grated pineapple to a tumbler of peanut butter, mix thoroughly,  add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, a dash of cayenne, a half  teaspoonful of paprika. Put this between thin slices of brown bread,  buttered; press together and cut into halves.          SWEET SANDWICHES      Under this heading we place all those dainty sandwiches that are made  from thin slices of bread and butter and a jam or fruit filling. They  are usually cut into circles; it is more economical to do this before  the bread is buttered, unless you can cut rounds from one side, and a  crescent above it. Almost any sweet may be used. Serve with chocolate or  coffee according to the fruit, either for an afternoon tea or an  \"evening.\"      Cherry Sandwiches    Chop a quarter of a pound of candied cherries very fine, adding  occasionally as you chop them a few drops of orange juice, if you use  wine, a few drops of sherry. Mix thoroughly and spread over water thins,  making it a little deeper in the center than at the edges. These  sandwiches are better made from crackers than from bread. Arrange neatly  on a pretty glass dish, and they are ready to serve.      Fig Sandwiches    Split a dozen figs and scrape out the soft portion, rejecting the skins;  work this to a paste. Cut the slices of bread from the loaf, buttering  before you cut them; make them quite thin. Remove the crusts, and spread  this thick paste over the bread and roll carefully; press for a moment  until there is no danger of the roll opening; roll each in a piece of  tissue paper; twist the ends as you would an old-fashioned \"secret,\" or  they may be tied with baby ribbon. These are exceedingly wholesome and  palatable.      Fruit and Nut Sandwiches    These are perhaps the most attractive of all the sweet sandwiches.    Put through the meat chopper a quarter of a pound of almonds with half  a pound of washed figs, the same quantity of dates, the same of raisins,  and a pound of pecan nuts; put them through alternately so that they  will be mixed in chopping. Pack the mixture into round baking powder  tins, pressing it down firmly, and stand it aside over night. When  wanted, dip the tin in hot water, loosen it with a knife and shake out  the mixture. With a sharp knife cut into very thin slices and put them  between two rounds of buttered bread. Serve with chocolate.    The combination may be varied; candied cherries, citron or any of the  candied fruits may be substituted for the dates and figs. Brazilian and  pine nuts may be substituted for a portion of the pecans.      Orange Marmalade Sandwiches    These sandwiches may be made precisely the same as fig sandwiches,  substituting the orange marmalade for the figs.      Sponge Cake Sandwiches    Bake a sponge cake in a square loaf; cut it into slices a quarter of an  inch thick; cut the slices into rounds with a small biscuit cutter. With  another small cutter take out the center leaving the ring; put this ring  on top of a solid round making sort of a patty as it were; fill the  spaces with a mixture of chopped candied fruit that has been soaked in  orange juice over night; cover the top with the meringue made from white  of egg and sugar; put them in the oven to brown, dish neatly and they  are ready to use. These cannot stand over an hour as the fruit will  soften the cake.      Fresh Fruit Sandwiches    These sandwiches are exceedingly nice to serve for afternoon teas. They  must be used soon after they are made. They will, however, if wrapped in  a damp napkin, keep for an hour, but as fruit is soft the bread is  liable to become moist, which spoils the sandwich.    Butter the bread and put between layers of sliced strawberries, dusted  with powdered sugar; or raspberries, or large blackberries cut into  halves; or peaches, finely chopped; or apple seasoned with a little  salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice; or sliced bananas with a dash  of lemon juice, are all nice.      Raisin Sandwiches    Put one-half pound of seeded raisins through the meat grinder, add a  quarter of a pound of almonds that have been blanched, dried and ground.  Add a half tumbler of quince jelly, mix thoroughly and put between thin  slices of buttered white bread. These sandwiches are very nice in place  of cake for afternoon teas or evening companies.      Afternoon Teas    Stone a quarter of a pound of dates, put them through a meat grinder,  add to them a half tumbler of nut butter, mix until smooth, add four  tablespoonfuls of sweet cream and a tablespoonful of orange juice. Put  this mixture between thin slices of white buttered bread, press  together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers or four small triangles.      Nut and Apple Sandwiches    Put a half cupful of _thick_ stewed apples into a bowl, add the grated  yellow rind of quarter of an orange and one cupful of finely chopped  mixed nuts. Spread this on saltines, Uneedas, or any crisp cracker. Put  on top another cracker and serve at once. These are very nice for  children's parties. Of course one may use buttered bread, either white  or brown.      Grape Fruit Sandwiches    Spread any crisp cracker with a thin layer of grape fruit marmalade, put  on top another "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#6)"],[1,"n. He was anxious that the hounds, which, on the previous day, had  arrived at the village, should enjoy good sport during their stay in the  neighbourhood. But he saw nothing of the animals he had come to watch;  as soon as they detected his whereabouts they retreated hastily to the  pond at the upper end of the garden, gained the river, and, like Lutra,  swam homewards around the bend. But, less familiar than Lutra with the  strength of the current, they left the water as they approached the  fall, and crept through the deep shadows of the alder-roots till they  reached a point at some distance beyond the pool.    These events of the night were of the utmost importance to the otters as  connected with the events of the morrow. During the early morning the  villager paid a second visit to the garden, and examined closely the  soft mud at the margin of the ponds. The remains of the otters'  feast--the skins and the eyes of frogs--lay in several places, and, near  the largest of the ponds, the otters' \"spur\" showed clearly that the  animals had for some time been busy there. Taking a straight course to  the river above the pools, the watcher again detected the marks of the  otters on the sloping bank. By the riverside below the garden, however,  he failed to observe any further sign, and so concluded that the animals  had probably left the water at the opposite bank.    When, later, the Hunt crossed the bridge on its way up-stream, the  villager told his story to the Master, who immediately led his hounds  over the hill-top in the direction of the ponds. This unexpected  movement drew the followers of the Hunt away from the river; they  imagined that the hounds were to be taken across country to a well known  gorge where, during a previous season, good sport had been obtained.    At the farm, the Master, leaving the hounds to the care of the  whippers-in, waited till the villagers and the farmers had congregated  in the yard. He then addressed the crowd, telling them that otters had  visited the garden during the night and probably were still in hiding  there, and that, if good sport were desired, it would be wise for his  followers to form two groups and watch the fords above and below the  river-bend, while he, alone, accompanied the hounds to the garden; his  chief reason, he said, for pointing out to them the advisability of  leaving him was that if an otter still remained near the pond it should  be given every chance of reaching the river without molestation. The  crowd, recognising the wisdom of the Master's remarks, moved off with  the whippers-in to the fords; and, when all was in readiness, the pack  was led into the garden. One, and another, and yet another of the \"young  entry\" soon gave tongue; then, after a minute's deliberation, an old,  experienced hound raised his head from the rushes, uttered a single  deep, clear note, climbed the garden hedge, and galloped across the  meadow towards the river.    The rest of the hounds speedily found the line of the \"drag,\" but all  came to a check at the water's edge. They were taken back to the ponds,  and thence to the pool by the farm, but the scent was weak above the  waterfall. They again \"cast\" to the upper end of the garden, and onward  to the river. Carefully searching every hole and corner in the bank,  they drew down-stream around the bend, and at last struck the scent of  the otters among the reeds below the pool. Lutra heard them tearing  madly past, heard also the dull thud of human footsteps above her  \"holt,\" but she discreetly remained close-hidden in her sleeping  chamber. For hours, in a pool beyond the trout-reach, her visitors of  the previous night were hustled to and fro, and frequent cries of \"Gaze!  gaze!\" and \"Bubble avent!\" mingled with the clamour of the hounds. Then  the commotion seemed suddenly to subside. After an interval the hounds  splashed by once more among the alder-roots, and the thud of human  footsteps resounded in the \"holt.\" In the silence that followed, Lutra,  reassured, dived from her \"holt,\" and, paddling gently to the surface,  saw the last stragglers of the Hunt climbing the slope towards the farm.    That night no otter from the down-stream trout-reach wandered to the  salmon-pool beneath the farm. The water-voles and the moorhens were  unusually alert as they swam hither and thither in the little bays along  the edge of the current. The fear of man and his loud-tongued hounds  rested, like a spell, on the creatures of the river. Even Lutra felt its  power; but when the scent of her foes became so faint as to be lost in  the fragrance of the meadow-sweet along the river-bank, she ventured  into the old garden, and, on returning to the pool, played again in the  raging water by the fall.          III.    THE GORGE OF ALLTYCAFN.      When Lutra had attained her full size and strength she was wooed and won  by a young dog-otter of her own age, and lived with him in a \"holt\"  among the great rocks of Alltycafn. Now, again, the Hunt arrived in the  neighbourhood. It was a lovely morning in May. The sun shone brightly;  the leaves were breaking from their sheaths; the birds sang blithely in  the trees. Suddenly the otters, resting in their \"holt,\" were awakened  by a loud commotion--the sounds of hurrying feet, reverberating in the  chamber among the boulders, and then the music of the shaggy hounds,  varied occasionally by the yap-yap of the terriers. The noise drew  rapidly nearer. Presently a man, in red stockings and vest, blue  breeches and coat, and a blue hunting cap bearing an otter's \"pad\"  mounted in silver, poked among the boulders with a steelshod pole. The  dog-otter was now thoroughly alarmed. He rushed from his lair, dived  straight into the stream, headed through the seething current, and rose  in the adjoining pool. Threatened by a hound, he dived again, walked  over the gravel, and swam under the gnarled roots of an oak. The members  of the Hunt stood watching the bubbles, filled by his breath, as they  floated up and broke. The hounds swam pell-mell in hot pursuit, and the  otter was forced to turn up-stream. Moving cautiously under the rocky  ledges, he regained the \"holt,\" where his terrified mate awaited his  return. Sorely pressed, the dog-otter hid close, hoping to baffle his  relentless pursuers. But a bristling, snarling terrier soon came down  the shaft from the bank. Maddened, and courageous with the fury of  despair, Lutra seized the intruder by the muzzle, and, in the combat  that ensued, sorely mangled her assailant's lips and nostrils. Then, as  her mate dived out once more and swam down-stream, she also left the  chamber. She rose immediately among the surrounding boulders, and hid in  the furthest recess. With nostrils, eyes, and ears raised slightly above  the surface of the water, she stayed there, unseen and hardly daring to  breathe, and, with strained senses watched closely every movement of  hounds and hunters.    Fortunately for Lutra, the arch of the boulders below was shaped so  peculiarly that the scent of her breath and body was sucked into a  cavity and carried down-stream, and, passing beneath the stone, mingled,  at the raging cataract near the rock, with air in the bubbles formed by  the tumult of the waters. These bubbles, instead of bursting, were drawn  into the vortex of a little whirlpool; and the keen-nosed hounds, though  suspicious, could form no definite opinion as to the presence of a  second otter among the rocks. The terrier knew the secret, but he had  been put out of action and sent off, post haste, to the nearest  veterinary surgeon. Lutra saw her tormentors--some of them of the pure  otter-hound breed, some half otter-hound, half fox-hound, and others,  again, fox-hounds trained for otter-hunting--rushing backwards and  forwards in the water and on the bank. Another terrier, led by a boy,  strained at his leash near the river's brink. Women, dressed, like the  men, in smart scarlet and blue, and as ready to wade into the stream as  the huntsman himself, stood leaning on their otter-poles not far away.  At the fords above and below the \"pool,\" the dog-otter's egress was  barred by outposts of the enemy standing and splashing, in complete  lines, from bank to bank. Once, in despair, the otter actually tried to  break through the human chain; but a hunter \"tailed\" him for a moment,  and then dropped him into the deeper water beyond the ford.    The sound of horn, the shouts of men, the deep-toned notes of great  hounds, the shrill yapping of eager terriers, and the splashing and the  plunging on every side, almost bewildered Lutra. Fearing to move from  her shelter, she floated in the deep basin of the hidden pool beside the  cataract, till at last the commotion gradually subsided, and hounds and  hunters passed out of sight down-stream.    Lutra awaited her mate's return, but in vain. Not till night did she  venture from her hiding place. When, however, the stars appeared, she  swam wearily from pool to pool, calling, calling, calling. She explored  each little bay, each crevice in the rock. She walked up the dry bed of  a tributary brook, and searched among the gnarled roots and the dry,  brown grass fringing the gravelly watercourse. She skirted the meadows  and the rocks where the hunters had beaten down the gorse and the  brambles near her home; thence she returned to the pool. Hitherto she  had loved the placid night; to her the stillness was significant of  peace. But now that stillness was full of sadness, and weariness, and  monotony. The shadows were deep within the gorge; from the distant woods  the hoot of an owl mocked her loneliness. She heard no glad answering  cry. Still calling, calling, calling, she floated through the shadows,  and out into the moonlight shimmering on the placid water below the  gorge; but she sought and called in vain.    Lutra spent the rest of that year in widowhood. In consequence of her  fight with the terrier,"]]]
