The  Indians were alarmed and fled, many of them not having their guns in  their hands; but I had carefully reloaded mine, and had it ready for  use. Throwing myself down close to the body of the cow, and behind it, I  waited till the other came up within a few yards of the carcase, when I  fired upon her; she turned, gave one or two jumps, and fell dead. We had  now the meat of two fat cows, which was as much as we wanted;  accordingly we repaired, without delay, to the appointed place, where we  found our party, whose hunger was already somewhat allayed by a deer one  of them had killed.\"    In hunting the Bison, the spear and the arrow are still much in use  among the Indians. The following sketch (after Catlin) represents an  Indian in the act of shooting a Bison with the arrow:--    [Illustration]    In the 'Letters and Notes on the North-American Indians,' by Catlin,  there are a great many interesting details of the Bison (or Buffalo, as  it is there called).    \"Six days of severe travelling have brought us from the Camanchee  village to the north bank of the Canadian, where we are snugly encamped  on a beautiful plain, and in the midst of countless numbers of  buffaloes; and halting a few days to recruit our horses and men, and dry  meat to last us the remainder of our journey.    \"The plains around this, for many miles, seem actually speckled, in  distance and in every direction, with herds of grazing buffaloes; and  for several days, the officers and men have been indulged in a general  license to gratify their sporting propensities; and a scene of bustle  and cruel slaughter it has been, to be sure! From morning till night,  the camp has been daily almost deserted. The men have dispersed in  little squads, in all directions, and are dealing death to these poor  creatures to a most cruel and wanton extent, merely for the pleasure of  destroying, generally without stopping to cut out the meat. During  yesterday and to day, several hundreds have undoubtedly been killed, and  not so much as the flesh of half a dozen used. Such immense swarms of  them are spread over this tract of country, and so divided and terrified  have they become, finding their enemies in all directions where they  run, that the poor beasts seem completely bewildered, running here and  there, and, as often as otherwise, come singly advancing to the  horsemen, as if to join them for their company, and are easily shot  down. In the turmoil and confusion, when their assailants have been  pushing them forward, they have galloped through our encampment, jumping  over our fires, upsetting pots and kettles, driving horses from their  fastenings, and throwing the whole encampment into the greatest  consternation and alarm.\"    Speaking of the attacks made upon them by the Wolves, he says, \"When the  herd is together the Wolves never attack them, as they instantly gather  for combined resistance, which they effectually make. But when the herds  are travelling, it often happens that an aged or wounded one lingers at  a little distance behind, and when fairly out of sight of the herd, is  set upon by the voracious hunters, which often gather to the number of  fifty or more, and are sure at last to torture him to death, and use him  up at a meal. The Buffalo, however, is a huge and furious animal, and  when his retreat is cut off, makes desperate and deadly resistance,  contending to the last moment for the right of life, and oftentimes  deals death by wholesale to his canine assailants.    \"During my travels in these regions, I have several times come across  such a gang of these animals surrounding an old or wounded bull, where  it would seem, from appearances, that they had been for several days in  attendance, and at intervals desperately engaged in the effort to take  his life. But a short time since, as one of my hunting companions and  myself were returning to our encampment, with our horses loaded with  meat, we discovered at a distance a huge bull, encircled with a gang of  white wolves. We rode up as near as we could without driving them away;  and being within pistol-shot, we had a remarkably good view, where I sat  for a few moments and made a sketch in my note-book. After which we rode  up, and gave the signal for them to disperse, which they instantly did,  withdrawing themselves to the distance of fifty or sixty rods, when we  found, to our great surprise, that the animal had made desperate  resistance, until his eyes were entirely eaten out of his head; the  gristle of his nose was mostly gone; his tongue was half eaten off, and  the skin and flesh of his legs torn almost literally into strings. In  this tattered and torn condition the poor old veteran stood bracing up  in the midst of his devourers, who had ceased hostilities for a few  minutes, to enjoy a sort of parley, recovering strength to resume the  attack in a few moments again. In this group, some were reclining to  gain breath, whilst others were sneaking about, and licking their chaps  in anxiety for a renewal of the attack; and others, less lucky, had been  crushed to death by the feet or the horns of the bull. I rode nearer to  the pitiable object, as he stood bleeding and trembling before me, and  said to him,--\"Now is your time, old fellow, and you had better be off.\"  Though blind, and nearly destroyed, he straightened up, and, trembling  with excitement, dashed off at full speed upon the prairie, in a  straight line. We turned our horses, and resumed our march; and when we  had advanced a mile or more, we looked back, and again saw the ill-fated  animal surrounded by his tormentors, to whose insatiable voracity he  unquestionably soon fell a victim.\"    [Illustration: Bison surrounded by Wolves, after Catlin.]    It has frequently been noticed, that whenever a female Bison, having a  calf, is slain, the young one remains by its fallen dam, with signs of  strong natural affection, and instinctively follows the inanimate  carcase of its parent to the residence of the hunter. In this way many  calves are secured.    According to Mr. Catlin's account these young animals are induced to  follow any one who merely breathes in their nostrils. \"I have often,\"  says he, \"in concurrence with a known custom of the country, held my  hands over the eyes of the calf, and breathed a few strong breaths into  its nostrils; after which I have, with my hunting companions, rode  several miles into our encampment, with the little prisoner busily  following the heels of my horse the whole way, as closely as its  instinct would attach it to the company of its dam.    [Illustration: Bison Calf, about three weeks old.]    \"This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with in  the habits of this wild country; and although I had often heard of it,  and felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to bear  testimony to the fact, from the numerous instances which I have  witnessed since I came into the country. During the time that I resided  at this post (Teton River) in the spring of the year, on my way up the  river, I assisted in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these  little prisoners, which sometimes followed for five or six miles close  to our horse's heels, and even into the Fur Company's Fort, and into the  stable where our horses were led. In this way, before I left for the  head waters of the Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen,  which Mr. Laidlaw was successfully raising with the aid of a good milch  cow, and which were to be committed to the care of Mr. Chouteau, to be  transported, by the return of the steamer, to his extensive plantation  in the vicinity of St. Louis.\"    The uses which are made of the various parts of the Bison are numerous.  The hide, which is thick and rather porous, is converted by the Indians  into mocassins for the winter; they also make their shields of it. When  dressed with the hair on, it is made into clothing by the natives, and  most excellent blankets by the European settlers; so valuable, indeed,  is it esteemed, that three or four pounds sterling a piece are not  unfrequently given for good ones in Canada, where they are used as  travelling cloaks. The fleece, which sometimes weighs eight pounds, is  spun and wove into cloth. Stockings, gloves, garters, &c., are likewise  knit with it, appearing and lasting as well as those made of the best  sheep's wool. In England it has been made into remarkably fine cloth.    \"There are,\" says Catlin, \"by a fair calculation, more than 300,000  Indians who are now subsisting on the flesh of the buffaloes, and by  these animals supplied with, all the luxuries of life which they  desire, as they know of none others. The great variety of uses to which  they convert the body and other parts of that animal, are almost  incredible to the person who has not actually dwelt amongst these  people, and closely studied their modes and customs. Every part of their  flesh is converted into food, in one shape or other, and on it they  entirely subsist. The skins of the animals are worn by the Indians  instead of blankets; their skins, when tanned, are used as coverings for  their lodges and for their beds; undressed, they are used for  constructing canoes, for saddles, for bridles, l'arrets, lasos, and  thongs. The horns are shaped into ladles and spoons; the brains are used  for dressing the skins; their bones are used for saddle-trees, for  war-clubs, and scrapers for graining the robes; and others are broken up  for the marrow fat which is contained in them. The sinews are used for  strings and backs to their bows, for thread to string their beads and  sew their dresses. The feet of the animals are boiled, with their hoofs,  for the glue they contain, for fastening their arrow points, and many  other uses.

The `O.E.D.' treats <i>Ana</i> as an independent word, rightly  explaining it as <i>anastomosing</i>, but its quotation from  the `Athenaeum' (1871), on which it relies,is a misprint.  For  the origin and coinage of the word, see quotation 1834.  See  the aboriginal name <i>Billabong</i>.    1834.  Col.Jackson, `Journal of Royal Geographical Society,' p. 79:    \"Such branches of a river as after separation re-unite, I would  term <i>anastomosing-branches</i>; or, if a word might be  coined, <i>ana-branches</i>, and the islands they form,  <i>branch-islands</i>.  Thus, if we would say, `the river in  this part of its course divides into several  <i>ana-branches</i>,' we should immediately understand the  subsequent re-union of the branches to the main trunk.\"    Col. Jackson was for a while Secretary and Editor of the  Society's Journal.  In Feb. 1847 he resigned that position, and  in the journal of that year there is the following amusing  ignorance of his proposed word--    1847.  `Condensed Account of Sturt's Exploration in the  Interior of Australia--Journal of the Royal Geographical  Society,' p. 87:    \"Captain Sturt proposed sending in advance to ascertain the  state of the Ana branch of the Darling, discovered by Mr. Eyre  on a recent expedition to the North.\"    No fewer than six times on two pages is the word  <i>anabranch</i> printed as two separate words, and as if  <i>Ana</i> were a proper name.  In the Index volume it appears  \"Ana, a branch of the Darling.\"    1847.  L. Leichhardt, `Overland Expedition,' p. 35:    \"The river itself divided into anabranches which . . . made the  whole valley a maze of channels.\"    1865.  W. Howitt, `Discovery in Australia,' vol. i. p. 298:    \"What the Major calls, after the learned nomenclature of  Colonel Jackson, in the `Journal of the Geographical Society,'  anabranches, but which the natives call billibongs, channels  coming out of a stream and returning into it again.\"    1871.  `The Athenaeum,' May 27, p. 660 (' O.E.D.'):    \"The Loddon district is called the County of Gunbower,  which means, it is said, an ana branch [sic].\"    1890.

There are three Australian forms, distinguished by Robert  Brown as species.  The flower is very common in the meadows in  early spring, and is therefore called the <i>Native Snow  Drop</i>.  In Tasmania it is called <i>Nancy</i>.    1835. Ross, `Hobart Town Almanack,' 67:    \"Spotted Anguillaria.  Nancy.  The little lively white flower  with blue spots in the centre, about 2 inches high, that  everywhere enlivens our grassy hills in spring, resembling the  Star of Bethlehem.\"    1878.  W. R. Guilfoyle, `Australian Botany,' p. 83:    \"Native Snowdrop.  <i>Anguillaria Australis</i>.  The earliest  of all our indigenous spring-flowering plants. . . .

It is a jumping animal exclusively insectivorous.    <hw>Antipodes</hw>, <i>n</i>. properly a Greek word, the plural  of <i>'antipous</i>, lit. \"having feet opposed.\"  The  ancients, however, had no knowledge of the southern hemisphere.  Under the word <i>perioikos</i>, Liddell and Scott explain that  <i>'antipodes</i> meant \"those who were in opposite parallels  and meridians.\"  The word <i>Antipodes</i> was adopted into the  Latin language, and occurs in two of the Fathers, Lactantius  and Augustine.  By the mediaeval church to believe in the  antipodes was regarded as heresy.  `O.E.D.' quotes two examples  of the early use of the word in English.    1398.  `Trevisa Barth. De P. R.,' xv. lii. (1495), p. 506:    \"Yonde in Ethiopia ben the Antipodes, men that have theyr fete  ayenst our fete.\"    1556.  `Recorde Cast. Knowl.,' 93:    \"People . . . called of the Greeks and Latines also  <i>'antipodes</i>, <i>Antipodes</i>, as you might say  Counterfooted, or Counterpasers.\"    Shakspeare uses the word in five places, but, though he knew  that this \"pendent world\" was spherical, his Antipodes were not  Australasian.  In three places he means only the fact that it  is day in the Eastern hemisphere when it is night in England.    `Midsummer Night's Dream,' III. ii. 55:                              \"I'll believe as soon  This whole earth may be bored, and that the moon  May thro' the centre creep and so displease  His brother's noontide with the Antipodes.\"    `Merchant of Venice,' V. 127:    \"We should hold day with the Antipodes  If you would walk in absence of the sun.\"    `Richard II.,' III. ii. 49:    \"Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,   Whilst we were wandering with the Antipodes.\"    In `Henry VI.,' part 3, I. iv. 135, the word more clearly  designates the East:    \"Thou art as opposite to every good   As the Antipodes are unto us,   Or as the South to the Septentrion.\" [<i>sc</i>. the North.]    But more precise geographical indications are given in `Much  Ado,' II. i. 273, where Benedick is so anxious to avoid  Beatrice that he says--    \"I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that  you can devise to send me on. I will fetch you a tooth-picker  now from the farthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of  Prester John's foot; fetch you a hair of the great Kam's beard;  do you any embassage to the Pygmies rather than hold three  words conference with this harpy.\"    Now the Pygmies lived on the Upper Nile, near Khartoum,  Prester John in India, and the great Kam (Khan) in Tartary.    The word <i>Antipodes</i> in modern use is applied rather to  places than to people. Geographically, the word means a place  exactly opposite on the surface of the globe, as Antipodes  Island (Eastward of New Zealand), which is very near the  opposite end of the diameter of the globe passing through  London.  But the word is often used in a wider sense, and the  whole of Australasia is regarded as the Antipodes of Great  Britain.    The question is often asked whether there is any singular to  the word Antipodes, and `O.E.D.' shows that <i>antipode</i> is  still used in the sense of the exact opposite of a  person. <i>Antipod</i> is also used, especially playfully. The  adjectives used are <i>Antipodal</i> and <i>Antipodean</i>.    1640.  Richard Brome [Title]:    \"The Antipodes; comedy in verse.\"  [Acted in 1638, first  printed 4t0. 1640.]    <hw>Ant-orchis</hw>, <i>n</i>. an Australian and Tasmanian  orchid, <i>Chiloglottis gunnii</i>, Lind.    <hw>Apple</hw> and <hw>Apple-tree</hw>, <i>n</i>. and  <i>adj</i>.  The names are applied to various indigenous trees,  in some cases from a supposed resemblance to the English fruit,  in others to the foliage of the English tree. The varieties  are--    Black or Brush Apple--    <i>Achras australis</i>, R. Br.    Emu A.--    <i>Owenia acidula</i>, F. v.
