Is it not whimsical  enough that Luther, Calvin, and Zuinglius, all of them wretched authors,  should have founded sects which are now spread over a great part of  Europe, that Mahomet, though so ignorant, should have given a religion to  Asia and Africa, and that Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Clark, Mr. Locke, Mr. Le  Clerc, etc., the greatest philosophers, as well as the ablest writers of  their ages, should scarcely have been able to raise a little flock, which  even decreases daily.    This it is to be born at a proper period of time.  Were Cardinal de Retz  to return again into the world, neither his eloquence nor his intrigues  would draw together ten women in Paris.    Were Oliver Cromwell, he who beheaded his sovereign, and seized upon the  kingly dignity, to rise from the dead, he would be a wealthy City trader,  and no more.        LETTER VIII.--ON THE PARLIAMENT      The members of the English Parliament are fond of comparing themselves to  the old Romans.    Not long since Mr. Shippen opened a speech in the House of Commons with  these words, \"The majesty of the people of England would be wounded.\"  The  singularity of the expression occasioned a loud laugh; but this  gentleman, so far from being disconcerted, repeated the same words with a  resolute tone of voice, and the laugh ceased.  In my opinion, the majesty  of the people of England has nothing in common with that of the people of  Rome, much less is there any affinity between their Governments.  There  is in London a senate, some of the members whereof are accused (doubtless  very unjustly) of selling their voices on certain occasions, as was done  in Rome; this is the only resemblance.  Besides, the two nations appear  to me quite opposite in character, with regard both to good and evil.  The  Romans never knew the dreadful folly of religious wars, an abomination  reserved for devout preachers of patience and humility.  Marius and  Sylla, Caesar and Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, did not draw their swords  and set the world in a blaze merely to determine whether the flamen  should wear his shirt over his robe, or his robe over his shirt, or  whether the sacred chickens should eat and drink, or eat only, in order  to take the augury.  The English have hanged one another by law, and cut  one another to pieces in pitched battles, for quarrels of as trifling a  nature.  The sects of the Episcopalians and Presbyterians quite  distracted these very serious heads for a time.  But I fancy they will  hardly ever be so silly again, they seeming to be grown wiser at their  own expense; and I do not perceive the least inclination in them to  murder one another merely about syllogisms, as some zealots among them  once did.    But here follows a more essential difference between Rome and England,  which gives the advantage entirely to the latter--viz., that the civil  wars of Rome ended in slavery, and those of the English in liberty.  The  English are the only people upon earth who have been able to prescribe  limits to the power of kings by resisting them; and who, by a series of  struggles, have at last established that wise Government where the Prince  is all-powerful to do good, and, at the same time, is restrained from  committing evil; where the nobles are great without insolence, though  there are no vassals; and where the people share in the Government  without confusion.    The House of Lords and that of the Commons divide the legislative power  under the king, but the Romans had no such balance.  The patricians and  plebeians in Rome were perpetually at variance, and there was no  intermediate power to reconcile them.  The Roman senate, who were so  unjustly, so criminally proud as not to suffer the plebeians to share  with them in anything, could find no other artifice to keep the latter  out of the administration than by employing them in foreign wars.  They  considered the plebeians as a wild beast, whom it behoved them to let  loose upon their neighbours, for fear they should devour their masters.  Thus the greatest defect in the Government of the Romans raised them to  be conquerors.  By being unhappy at home, they triumphed over and  possessed themselves of the world, till at last their divisions sunk them  to slavery.    The Government of England will never rise to so exalted a pitch of glory,  nor will its end be so fatal.  The English are not fired with the  splendid folly of making conquests, but would only prevent their  neighbours from conquering.  They are not only jealous of their own  liberty, but even of that of other nations.  The English were exasperated  against Louis XIV. for no other reason but because he was ambitious, and  declared war against him merely out of levity, not from any interested  motives.    The English have doubtless purchased their liberties at a very high  price, and waded through seas of blood to drown the idol of arbitrary  power.  Other nations have been involved in as great calamities, and have  shed as much blood; but then the blood they spilt in defence of their  liberties only enslaved them the more.    That which rises to a revolution in England is no more than a sedition in  other countries.  A city in Spain, in Barbary, or in Turkey, takes up  arms in defence of its privileges, when immediately it is stormed by  mercenary troops, it is punished by executioners, and the rest of the  nation kiss the chains they are loaded with.  The French are of opinion  that the government of this island is more tempestuous than the sea which  surrounds it, which indeed is true; but then it is never so but when the  king raises the storm--when he attempts to seize the ship of which he is  only the chief pilot.  The civil wars of France lasted longer, were more  cruel, and productive of greater evils than those of England; but none of  these civil wars had a wise and prudent liberty for their object.    In the detestable reigns of Charles IX. and Henry III. the whole affair  was only whether the people should be slaves to the Guises.  With regard  to the last war of Paris, it deserves only to be hooted at.  Methinks I  see a crowd of schoolboys rising up in arms against their master, and  afterwards whipped for it.  Cardinal de Retz, who was witty and brave  (but to no purpose), rebellious without a cause, factious without design,  and head of a defenceless party, caballed for caballing sake, and seemed  to foment the civil war merely out of diversion.  The Parliament did not  know what he intended, nor what he did not intend.  He levied troops by  Act of Parliament, and the next moment cashiered them.  He threatened, he  begged pardon; he set a price upon Cardinal Mazarin's head, and  afterwards congratulated him in a public manner.  Our civil wars under  Charles VI. were bloody and cruel, those of the League execrable, and  that of the Frondeurs ridiculous.    That for which the French chiefly reproach the English nation is the  murder of King Charles I., whom his subjects treated exactly as he would  have treated them had his reign been prosperous.  After all, consider on  one side Charles I., defeated in a pitched battle, imprisoned, tried,  sentenced to die in Westminster Hall, and then beheaded.  And on the  other, the Emperor Henry VII., poisoned by his chaplain at his receiving  the Sacrament; Henry III. stabbed by a monk; thirty assassinations  projected against Henry IV., several of them put in execution, and the  last bereaving that great monarch of his life.  Weigh, I say, all these  wicked attempts, and then judge.        LETTER IX.--ON THE GOVERNMENT      That mixture in the English Government, that harmony between King, Lords,  and commons, did not always subsist.  England was enslaved for a long  series of years by the Romans, the Saxons, the Danes, and the French  successively.  William the Conqueror particularly, ruled them with a rod  of iron.  He disposed as absolutely of the lives and fortunes of his  conquered subjects as an eastern monarch; and forbade, upon pain of  death, the English either fire or candle in their houses after eight  o'clock; whether was this to prevent their nocturnal meetings, or only to  try, by an odd and whimsical prohibition, how far it was possible for one  man to extend his power over his fellow-creatures.  It is true, indeed,  that the English had Parliaments before and after William the Conqueror,  and they boast of them, as though these assemblies then called  Parliaments, composed of ecclesiastical tyrants and of plunderers  entitled barons, had been the guardians of the public liberty and  happiness.    The barbarians who came from the shores of the Baltic, and settled in the  rest of Europe, brought with them the form of government called States or  Parliaments, about which so much noise is made, and which are so little  understood.  Kings, indeed, were not absolute in those days; but then the  people were more wretched upon that very account, and more completely  enslaved.  The chiefs of these savages, who had laid waste France, Italy,  Spain, and England, made themselves monarchs.  Their generals divided  among themselves the several countries they had conquered, whence sprung  those margraves, those peers, those barons, those petty tyrants, who  often contested with their sovereigns for the spoils of whole nations.  These were birds of prey fighting with an eagle for doves whose blood the  victorious was to suck.  Every nation, instead of being governed by one  master, was trampled upon by a hundred tyrants.  The priests soon played  a part among them.  Before this it had been the fate of the Gauls, the  Germans, and the Britons, to be always governed by their Druids and the  chiefs of their villages, an ancient kind of barons, not so tyrannical as  their successors.

NATIONAL DRESS[6]      I have hitherto successfully resisted to temptation of either answering  your or Mr. Irwin's criticism of the humble work I am doing in  Champaran. Nor am I going to succumb now except with regard to a matter  which Mr. Irwin has thought fit to dwell upon and about which he has not  even taken the trouble of being correctly informed. I refer to his  remarks on my manner of dressing.    My \"familiarity with the minor amenities of Western civilisation\" has  taught me to respect my national costume, and it may interest Mr. Irwin  to know that the dress I wear in Champaran is the dress I have always  worn in India except that for a very short period in India I fell an  easy prey in common with the rest of my countrymen to the wearing of  semi-European dress in the courts and elsewhere outside Kathiawar. I  appeared before the Kathiawar courts now 21 years ago in precisely the  dress I wear in Champaran.    One change I have made and it is that, having taken to the occupation of  weaving and agriculture and having taken the vow of Swadeshi, my  clothing is now entirely hand-woven and hand-sewn and made by me or my  fellow workers. Mr. Irwin's letter suggests that I appear before the  ryots in a dress I have temporarily and specially adopted in Champaran  to produce an effect. The fact is that I wear the national dress because  it is the most natural and the most becoming for an Indian. I believe  that our copying of the European dress is a sign of our degradation,  humiliation and our weakness, and that we are committing a national sin  in discarding a dress which is best suited to the Indian climate and  which, for its simplicity, art and cheapness, is not to be beaten on the  face of the earth and which answers hygienic requirements. Had it not  been for a false pride and equally false notions of prestige, Englishmen  here would long ago have adopted the Indian costume. I may mention  incidentally that I do not go about Champaran bare headed. I do avoid  shoes for sacred reasons. But I find too that it is more natural and  healthier to avoid them whenever possible.    I am sorry to inform Mr. Irwin and your readers that my esteemed friend  Babu Brijakishore Prasad, the \"ex-Hon. Member of Council,\" still remains  unregenerate and retains the provincial cap and never walks barefoot and  \"kicks up\" a terrible noise even in the house we are living in by  wearing wooden sandals. He has still not the courage, in spite of most  admirable contact with me, to discard his semi-anglicised dress and  whenever he goes to see officials he puts his legs into the bifurcated  garment and on his own admission tortures himself by cramping his feet  in inelastic shoes. I cannot induce him to believe that his clients  won't desert him and the courts won't punish him if he wore his more  becoming and less expensive dhoti. I invite you and Mr. Irwin not to  believe the \"stories\" that the latter hears about me and my friends, but  to join me in the crusade against educated Indians abandoning their  manners, habits and customs which are not proved to be bad or harmful.  Finally I venture to warn you and Mr. Irwin that you and he will  ill-serve the cause both of you consider is in danger by reason of my  presence in Champaran if you continue, as you have done, to base your  strictures on unproved facts. I ask you to accept my assurance that I  should deem myself unworthy of the friendship and confidence of hundreds  of my English friends and associates--not all of them fellow cranks--if  in similar circumstances I acted towards them differently from my own  countrymen.
