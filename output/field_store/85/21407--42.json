She went to  him and asked him if he could cure her sterility. Dr. Brinkley made no  promises--he never does. But he told her the operation was a simple one,  and that it would improve her health, even if it failed to give her a  child. She gladly submitted to the operation.    Dr. Brinkley removed an interstitial gland from a live male goat. He  made a slight incision in the woman's abdomen, inserted the gland and  stitched it in. In a week the patient was about her household duties  again. Six months ago she gave birth to a healthy baby. It was a boy.  The mother was the happiest woman in Kansas.    The surgeon had treated six other cases similarly, but all were men--men  who loved children and yearned for parenthood. Three of the men are now  fathers of healthy children.    In each case Dr. Brinkley had used male goat glands--and all the babies  were boys.    Then this occurred to him:--    \"If I transplant female goat glands maybe the babies will be girls!\" He  decided to try it, and two months ago his opportunity arrived. A woman  came to him just as his first woman patient had come. She was 28 years  old, had been married six years, and was childless. Dr. Brinkley  performed the operation, using the glands of a female goat. He is now  awaiting results. \"I do not say this woman will have a girl baby,\" said  Dr. Brinkley today, \"but I am experimenting. It may be merely a  coincidence that all the babies so far have been boys. So far as I know,  I am the first surgeon to experiment with gland implantation in women.  I am also the first to use goat glands in preference to others.    \"Unquestionably I have cured sterility in one woman, and I have utmost  faith that it can be cured in any other, so long as all of her organs  are not missing. The operation is a little more difficult than it is in  the case of men, but no more serious. Where a man recovers, and can get  about, in two or three days, a woman recovers in a week.    \"All of my patients are much improved in their general health as a  result of the operation. I wouldn't say that this operation holds the  secret of eternal youth. I don't know. All my patients have been between  the ages of 32 and 48, so that I cannot speak from experience.  I believe, however, that the operation will prolong life; I know that it  improves the health in every way. But I cannot say that it will restore  the bloom of youth to an old man's cheek. I am considering, however, an  operation upon a man 80 years old who came to me and asked for the  operation. Whether he would be able to have children as a result of it I  do not know.\"    None of Dr. Brinkley's patients had been parents until they came to him.  Now the oldest of the babies is 13 months; another is 8 months and a  third is 6. Dr. Brinkley does not claim to be a specialist in gland  implantation; he is merely a practicing surgeon who has made a study of  the subject and is doing what he can to help unfortunate people. The  doctor's modesty until now has hidden his remarkable discovery from the  world, but he is now writing a report on his results.        (From the San Diego, Cal., +Union+, of date,    February 7, 1920.)    Scientists who formerly ignored Dr. Brinkley's letters are now writing  to him asking him for exhaustive reports of his work. The sarcastic  attitude came largely heretofore from those who were unwilling to  believe that such operations of the highest scientific importance, were  being performed in an out of the way village that couldn't be found on a  railway map.    Dr. Brinkley, who was graduated from the Medical Department of Loyola  University, and who has traveled over all the world, explained his  residence in Milford. After leaving the army he sought a location in a  small town, selecting Milford as the result of a newspaper  advertisement, and going there, found it to consist of less than 200  inhabitants. But the surrounding territory was rich and the farmers  prosperous, and in the isolated location he saw the chance of continuing  experiments begun at Bellevue Hospital, New York. Later he found himself  compelled to build his own hospital to care for the patients that  arrived, attracted by the news of the goat-gland operations. Dr.  Brinkley is 35 years old and has been a skilled surgeon for more than 15  years. He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of  Science, the American Medical Association, the Missouri Valley Medical  Association, the Kansas Medical Association, and a Fellow of the  Clinical Congress of Internal Medicine. He is also a 32nd Degree Mason.    In the treatment of pneumonia and influenza Dr. Brinkley uses serums of  his own invention. In the treatment of his cases of influenza last year  the reports of the health authorities of Geary County, Kansas, show that  Dr. Brinkley didn't lose a single case. Milford is in Geary County, and  Geary County swears by Dr. Brinkley.          CHAPTER V    A YEAR OF DEVELOPMENT      The intention in offering for your perusal the preceding newspaper  accounts of Dr. Brinkley's work in the opening months of the year 1920  was to show you what his views at that time were regarding the value of  the gland operation which he has since made his life-work. The Chicago  Tribune speaks of it as incidental to his general work as a surgeon. Dr.  Brinkley himself speaks of shortly beginning an experiment upon an old  man of 80. A year later he looked back upon a record of achievement of  the most astounding results in operations performed upon men of 75, 80,  and even 81. During this past year he has perfected his technique,  implants the male glands exclusively into men and the female glands or  ovaries into women, and has definitely selected the scrotum of the man  as the only right place in which to introduce the goat-glands for the  transplantation. You are here viewing the development of a great  scientific discovery from the beginning of its employment upon human  beings. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the year 1922 will  produce no embellishment of value in the form of a wider application of  the method. Some very striking limitations have been established during  the past year's work. For instance:    If the blood examination shows a positive Wasserman test for syphilis it  is useless to transplant the glands, because they will certainly slough  out. Active syphilis is antagonistic to the goat-tissue. Even latent  syphilis, showing a negative Wasserman, is likely to produce a slough of  the glands. Nothing should be concealed from the doctor, of course, and  yet it has happened at the hospital at Milford that a patient on being  questioned in advance of the operation has emphatically stated that he  had never contracted syphilis, and three days later, after the  transplantation, when the sloughing of the new glands had shown  something definitely wrong with the blood, this patient admitted that he  had not spoken the truth in the matter, but had contracted the disease  many years previously. On the other hand, in Locomoter Ataxia, in which  there is invariably a history of syphilis, the goat-glands take hold  without exception, the efficacy of the transplantation in this disease,  hitherto incurable by any means known to man, being due to the power of  the new glands to cause a dissolving of scar-tissue, in the opinion of  Dr. Abrams of San Francisco, who investigated the remarkable results  attained by Dr. Brinkley in his cures of Locomoter Ataxia by the  goat-gland operation.    If the goat-glands are transplanted into members of the Hebrew race  there follows invariably a high temperature persisting for several days,  after which the cure proceeds normally without any untoward occurrence.  Glands transplanted into a negro will slough, or, at least, they did so  in the one case on which Dr. Brinkley performed the operation, for no  apparent reason other than a supposed racial antagonism to goat-tissue.  No experiments have yet been conducted upon Japanese, Chinese, Hindus,  or our native Indians. When the blood count shows high in white  (leucocytes) and low in red, the glands will slough, but the reverse  condition does not hold true. And now let us consider the case of Mr.  Ernst, of Morganville, Kansas, who is over 77 years of age, and who  permits the use of his name and address. One of the most curious  features of his case is that when he came for the operation his hair,  white as snow, was thin on the scalp, the color of the skin of the scalp  showing through the hair, as it frequently does in the aged. That was  almost a year ago. Mr. Ernst's hair is now turning black all over the  head, the scalp shows a thickening in the growth, or an increase in the  quantity of hair, and you cannot now see the scalp through the hair. Mr.  Ernst wrote an excellent letter to Dr. Brinkley two months ago, and  states that he has no objection at all to its reproduction. When a  personal story of this kind is offered for use it is as well to use it  in its original form, but this so rarely happens in this work that for  its uniqueness alone it would be worth while to put it before you. With  some notable exceptions, the men patients who have been operated upon by  Dr. Brinkley feel ashamed of the fact. Not for anything would they let  their friends or acquaintances know anything about it. The veil of  secrecy is, of course, never lifted by the doctor. The women patients  have none of this false shame, apparently, but enjoy discussing the  results of the operation with their friends. It is, perhaps, natural  that a United States Senator, two of whom have been operated on with  much advantage to themselves, should shrink from the jocose remarks of  friend or foe and the curiosity of acquaintances. There is good reason,  in the case of a public man, for avoidance of notice in the matter, and  that is one of the advantages of having the hospital "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#6)"],[1," |  50 x 1320 =  66,000 |            |    687.51    4     | a 25  |  25 x 1320 =  33,000 |            |    756.25          | b 15  |  15 x 2640 =  39,600 |            |    5     |   10  |  10 x 3300 =  33,000 |            |    343.73    6     |   10  |  10 x 1980 =  19,800 |            |    206.24    ------|-------|                      |            |-------------          |       |              528,000 |            |   5500.00    ------+-------+----------------------+------------+-------------    It will be noted that the combined assessment for the two sections of  road is especially heavy on parcels 1, 2 and 3. In order to prevent  unjust charges against such properties, laws usually limit the total  assessment against any parcel of land to a fixed percentage of a fair  market value or of the assessed value. The assessment on these parcels  would be reduced as seemed expedient and the deficit would be  distributed over the remainder of the area in the same manner as the  original assessment was spread. In practice such re-distribution is  ordinarily made by the arbitrary adjustment in accordance with what  the authorized officials consider to be fair and equitable. The method  outlined is merely a mechanical means of securing distribution and  must not be considered as an infallible method of making the  assessment. It is always necessary to review the results in the light  of the actual benefits to be presumed for each parcel of land.  Nevertheless, the method outlined will prove equitable in a majority  of cases.    =General Taxation.=--There is a general community benefit derived from  the construction of good roads in that the actual cost of marketing  farm products is lessened with a resulting lowering of the price to  the consumer. The benefit also accrues from the greater facility with  which all community business may be conducted. The introduction of  better opportunities for social, religious and educational activities  in the rural districts which results from improved highways is also a  community benefit of no mean importance. A part of the cost of road  improvement may therefore be equitably paid from funds obtained by  general taxation.    A considerable portion of the current expense of maintaining the  township and county highway work and at least a part of the cost of  maintaining state highway activities is met from funds obtained by  general taxation. Likewise, the funds required for the amortization of  bond issues are often obtained from general taxation although vehicle  license fees are sometimes used for that purpose.    General taxes are levied on all taxable property in a political unit  under statutory provisions regulating the amount of the levy and the  purpose for which the revenue is to be used. In the aggregate, the  road taxes are large but in the township or county the rate is  generally small compared to some other taxes, such as the school tax.    =Vehicle Taxes.=--The great direct benefit derived by those who  actually operate vehicles over the roads justifies the policy of  requiring a vehicle to pay a license fee in lieu of other taxes, the  funds so obtained to be used for the construction and maintenance of  public highways. In practice, this method has already been applied to  motor vehicles in most states and has proven to be an important source  of revenue. Its application to horse-drawn vehicles has not been  attempted, due probably to the fact that such horse-drawn vehicles as  use the public highways are also employed about the farm or in the  towns and the determination of an equitable basis for taxation  involves many difficulties.    The rate of the fee for motor vehicles should be based on their  destructive effect on the road so far as that is possible. The scale  of fees should therefore take account of weight and speed of vehicle  and if the license is in lieu of all other taxes, it should also be  graduated with the cost of the vehicle.    When funds are thus derived, every precaution should be taken to  insure that the money is used judiciously for construction and  especially for maintenance on those roads most useful to motor  traffic.    =Highway Bonds.=--Bond issues for road improvement afford a means of  constructing roads and paying for them while they are being used. A  very large volume of such bonds are outstanding in the United States.  Road bonds should be issued only for durable types of improvement and  the life of the bond should be well within the probable useful life of  the road surface. It is customary and highly desirable that the  general nature and extent of the improvement be established before the  bonds are issued. It is desirable that bond issues be subject to  approval by referendum before issue and that is provided in every  instance.    Highway bonds are of three classes known as Sinking Fund, Annuity and  Serial Bonds, respectively. The earlier bonds issued were almost all  of the sinking fund class, but in recent years the serial bond has  been widely employed and is probably the most satisfactory to  administer.    =Sinking Fund Bonds.=[1]--When this type of bond is employed, the  amount of the expenditure for road improvement is determined upon and  the length of the period during which tax payments shall be made is  settled. To employ a concrete example, it may be assumed that $100,000  is to be expended for road work and is to be paid at the end of ten  years. The interest rate on the bonds will vary with the condition of  the bond market and the stability of the political unit issuing the  bonds, but is usually about 5 per cent. Knowing these factors, the  amount to be added to the sinking fund each year is computed. In order  to pay the interest on the bonds, a tax of suitable rate is levied,  and in order to retire the bonds at the end of the period, a sum is  set aside each year which is supposed to be invested and draw interest  which will be added to the principle, and the principle and interest  comprise the sinking fund. The principle of the sinking fund is  obtained by tax levies, a sum being added to the principle of the  sinking fund each year.        [1] For a more detailed discussion of highway bonds see Bulletin      136, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, which is the basis of this      discussion.    The success of this method of financing depends upon the proper  administration of the sinking fund. It must be invested with fidelity  and the fund be kept intact. Usually the sinking fund cannot be  invested at as high a rate of interest as the bonds bear and there is  some loss as a result. Road bonds bearing 5 per cent interest can  usually be sold at par while the sinking fund will usually net about 3  or 3-1/2 per cent interest. The total cost of a bond issue will be  greater by the sinking fund method than by either of the other methods  described.    =Annuity Bonds.=--Annuity bonds are drawn in such a manner that the  amount of the payment for principle and interest is the same each year  during the life of the bond. When the amount of the issue and the rate  of interest has been determined and the amount of the desired annual  payment has been determined, the number of years the bonds must run is  computed.    This method is convenient in that the amount of the tax to be levied  each year remains constant.    =Serial Bonds.=--Serial bonds are drawn so that a uniform amount of  the principle is retired each year after retirement starts and the  total interest payments decrease each year after the first bonds are  retired. The first bond may not be retired for a number of years after  the issue of the bonds, but when it once starts retirement proceeds at  a constant rate annually.    =Comparison of Methods of Issuing Bonds.=--The relative costs of  financing by either of the three methods depends upon the rate of  interest in each case and the net rate secured on the sinking fund  provided for retiring sinking fund bonds.    For comparative purposes, some typical examples are given in Table 3.  These illustrate the differences in total cost of securing $100,000 by  each of the three methods at various interest rates.

Better prices are obtained on contracts for  a large mileage than for smaller jobs, and the community can receive  the benefit more quickly than where construction proceeds piecemeal  with current funds. The vital consideration is to insure that the term  of the bonds is well within the useful life of the road, and that  ample provision is made to maintain the roads during that period.  Under proper restrictions the bond method of financing is to be  commended. The bonds are an attractive investment and readily  marketable on satisfactory terms.
