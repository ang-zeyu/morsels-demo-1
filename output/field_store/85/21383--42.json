[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#6)"],[1," precision to the teaching that each and all  were creatures, things made by the word of God. The bald statement that  the heaven and the earth were made by God might still have left room for  the imagination that the powers of nature were co-eternal with God, or  were at least subordinate divinities; or that other powers than God had  worked up into the present order the materials He had created. The  detailed account makes it clear that not only was the universe in  general created by God, but that there was no part of it that was not  fashioned by Him.    The next purpose was to set a seal of sanctity upon the Sabbath. In the  second chapter of Genesis we read--         \"On the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and       He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had       made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:       because that in it He had rested from all His work which God       created and made.\"    In this we get the institution of the _week_, the first ordinance  imposed by God upon man. For in the fourth of the ten commandments which  God gave through Moses, it is said--         \"The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it       thou shalt not do any work. . . . For in six days the Lord       made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and       rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath       day, and hallowed it.\"    And again, when the tabernacle was being builded, it was commanded--         \"The children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the       sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual       covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel       for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and       on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\"    God made the sun, moon, and stars, and appointed them \"for signs, and  for seasons, and for days, and years.\" The sun marks out the days; the  moon by her changes makes the months; the sun and the stars mark out the  seasons and the years. These were divisions of time which man would  naturally adopt. But there is not an exact number of days in the month,  nor an exact number of days or months in the year. Still less does the  period of seven days fit precisely into month or season or year; the  week is marked out by no phase of the moon, by no fixed relation between  the sun, the moon, or the stars. It is not a division of time that man  would naturally adopt for himself; it runs across all the natural  divisions of time.    What are the six days of creative work, and the seventh day--the  Sabbath--of creative rest? They are not days of man, they are days of  God; and our days of work and rest, our week with its Sabbath, can only  be the figure and shadow of that week of God; something by which we may  gain some faint apprehension of its realities, not that by which we can  comprehend and measure it.    Our week, therefore, is God's own direct appointment to us; and His  revelation that He fulfilled the work of creation in six acts or stages,  dignifies and exalts the toil of the labouring man, with his six days of  effort and one of rest, into an emblem of the creative work of God.

Supposed to represent the defeat of  Tiamat by Merodach.]          CHAPTER III    THE DEEP      The second verse of Genesis states, \"And the earth was without form and  void [_i. e._ waste and empty] and darkness was upon the face of the  deep.\" The word _teh[=o]m_, here translated _deep_, has been used to  support the theory that the Hebrews derived their Creation story from  one which, when exiles in Babylon, they heard from their conquerors. If  this theory were substantiated, it would have such an important bearing  upon the subject of the attitude of the inspired writers towards the  objects of nature, that a little space must be spared for its  examination.    The purpose of the first chapter of Genesis is to tell us that--         \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"    From it we learn that the universe and all the parts that make it  up--all the different forms of energy, all the different forms of  matter--are neither deities themselves, nor their embodiments and  expressions, nor the work of conflicting deities. From it we learn that  the universe is not self-existent, nor even (as the pantheist thinks of  it) the expression of one vague, impersonal and unconscious, but  all-pervading influence. It was not self-made; it did not exist from all  eternity. It is not God, for God made it.    But the problem of its origin has exercised the minds of many nations  beside the Hebrews, and an especial interest attaches to the solution  arrived at by those nations who were near neighbours of the Hebrews and  came of the same great Semitic stock.    From the nature of the case, accounts of the origin of the world cannot  proceed from experience, or be the result of scientific experiment. They  cannot form items of history, or arise from tradition. There are only  two possible sources for them; one, Divine revelation; the other, the  invention of men.    The account current amongst the Babylonians has been preserved to us by  the Syrian writer Damascius, who gives it as follows:--         \"But the Babylonians, like the rest of the Barbarians, pass       over in silence the one principle of the Universe, and they       constitute two, Tavthe and Apason, making Apason the husband       of Tavthe, and denominating her \"the mother of the gods.\" And       from these proceeds an only-begotten son, Mumis, which, I       conceive, is no other than the intelligible world proceeding       from the two principles. From them also another progeny is       derived, Lakhe and Lakhos; and again a third, Kissare and       Assoros, from which last three others proceed, Anos and       Illinos and Aos. And of Aos and Dakhe is born a son called       Belos, who, they say, is the fabricator of the world.\"[26:1]    The actual story, thus summarized by Damascius, was discovered by Mr.  George Smith, in the form of a long epic poem, on a series of tablets,  brought from the royal library of Kouyunjik, or Nineveh, and he  published them in 1875, in his book on _The Chaldean Account of  Genesis_. None of the tablets were perfect; and of some only very small  portions remain. But portions of other copies of the poem have been  discovered in other localities, and it has been found possible to piece  together satisfactorily a considerable section, so that a fair idea of  the general scope of the poem has been given to us.    It opens with the introduction of a being, Tiamtu--the Tavthe of the  account of Damascius,--who is regarded as the primeval mother of all  things.         \"When on high the heavens were unnamed,        Beneath the earth bore not a name:        The primeval ocean was their producer;        Mummu Tiamtu was she who begot the whole of them.        Their waters in one united themselves, and        The plains were not outlined, marshes were not to be seen.        When none of the gods had come forth,        They bore no name, the fates (had not been determined)        There were produced the gods (all of them).\"[27:1]    The genealogy of the gods follows, and after a gap in the story, Tiamat,  or Tiamtu, is represented as preparing for battle, \"She who created  everything . . . produced giant serpents.\" She chose one of the gods,  Kingu, to be her husband and the general of her forces, and delivered to  him the tablets of fate.    The second tablet shows the god An[vs]ar, angered at the threatening  attitude of Tiamat, and sending his son Anu to speak soothingly to her  and calm her rage. But first Anu and then another god turned back  baffled, and finally Merodach, the son of Ea, was asked to become the  champion of the gods. Merodach gladly consented, but made good terms for  himself. The gods were to assist him in every possible way by entrusting  all their powers to him, and were to acknowledge him as first and chief  of all. The gods in their extremity were nothing loth. They feasted  Merodach and, when swollen with wine, endued him with all magical  powers, and hailed him--         \"Merodach, thou art he who is our avenger,        (Over) the whole universe have we given thee the kingdom.\"[28:1]    At first the sight of his terrible enemy caused even Merodach to falter,  but plucking up courage he advanced to meet her, caught her in his net,  and, forcing an evil wind into her open mouth--         \"He made the evil wind enter so that she could not close her lips.        The violence of the winds tortured her stomach, and        her heart was prostrated and her mouth was twisted.        He swung the club, he shattered her stomach;        he cut out her entrails; he over-mastered (her) heart;        he bound her and ended her life.        He threw down her corpse; he stood upon it.\"[28:2]    The battle over and the enemy slain, Merodach considered how to dispose  of the corpse.         \"He strengthens his mind, he forms a clever plan,        And he stripped her of her skin like a fish, according to his            plan.\"[28:3]    Of one half of the corpse of Tiamat he formed the earth, and of the  other half, the heavens. He then proceded to furnish the heavens and the  earth with their respective equipments; the details of this work  occupying apparently the fifth, sixth, and seventh tablets of the  series.    Under ordinary circumstances such a legend as the foregoing would not  have attracted much attention.

As Henry VIII. knew nothing of, and cared       less for, fine books, it is not very improbable that some of       the choicest volumes belonging to the late king were       presented to Cardinal Wolsey.]    During the reign of Henry VIII., I should suppose that the Earl of  Surrey[20] and Sir Thomas Wyatt were a little attached to  book-collecting; and that Dean Colet[21] and his friend Sir Thomas  More and Erasmus were downright Bibliomaniacs. There can be little  doubt but that neither the great LELAND[22] nor his Biographer  Bale,[23] were able to escape the contagion; and that, in the ensuing  period, Rogar [Transcriber's Note: Roger] Ascham became notorious for  the Book-disease. He purchased probably, during his travels  abroad[24] many a fine copy of the Greek and Latin Classics, from  which he read to his illustrious pupils, Lady Jane Grey, and Queen  Elizabeth: but whether he made use of an _Editio Princeps_, or a  _Large paper copy_, I have hitherto not been lucky enough to discover.  This learned character died in the vigour of life, and in the bloom  of reputation: and, as I suspect, in consequence of the  BIBLIOMANIA--for he was always collecting books, and always studying  them. His \"Schoolmaster\" is a work which can only perish with our  language.         [Footnote 20: The EARL of SURREY and SIR THOMAS WYATT were       among the first who taught their countrymen to be charmed       with the elegance and copiousness of their own language. How       effectually they accomplished this laudable object, will be       seen from the forthcoming beautiful and complete edition of       their works by the Rev. Dr. Nott.[B]]         [Footnote B: It fell to the lot of the printer of this       volume, during his apprenticeship to his father, to correct       the press of nearly the whole of Dr. Nott's labours, which       were completed, after several years of toil, when in the       extensive conflagration of the printing-office at Bolt       Court, Fleet-street, in 1819, all but _two_ copies were       totally destroyed!]         [Footnote 21: COLET, MORE, and ERASMUS [considering the       latter when he was in England] were _here_ undoubtedly the       great literary triumvirate of the early part of the 16th       century. The lives of More and Erasmus are generally read       and known; but of DEAN COLET it may not be so generally       known that his ardour for books and for classical literature       was keen, and insatiable; that, in the foundation of ST.       PAUL'S SCHOOL, he has left behind a name which entitles him       to rank in the foremost of those who have fallen victims to       the BIBLIOMANIA. How anxiously does he seem to have watched       the progress, and pushed the sale, of his friend Erasmus's       first edition of the Greek Testament! \"Quod scribis de Novo       Testamento intelligo. Et libri _novae editionis tuae hic avide       emuntur et passim leguntur_!\" The entire epistle (which may       be seen in Dr. Knight's dry Life of Colet, p. 315) is       devoted to an account of Erasmus's publications. \"I am       really astonished, my dear Erasmus [does he exclaim], at the       fruitfulness of your talents; that, without any fixed       residence, and with a precarious and limited income, you       contrive to publish so many and such excellent works.\"       Adverting to the distracted state of Germany at this period,       and to the wish of his friend to live secluded and       unmolested, he observes--\"As to the tranquil retirement       which you sigh for, be assured that you have my sincere       wishes for its rendering you as happy and composed as you       can wish it. Your age and erudition entitle you to such a       retreat. I fondly hope, indeed, that you will choose this       country for it, and come and live amongst us, whose       disposition you know, and whose friendship you have proved.\"         There is hardly a more curious picture of the custom of the       times, relating to the education of boys, than the Dean's       own Statutes for the regulation of St. Paul's School, which       he had founded. These shew, too, the _popular books_ then       read by the learned. \"The children shall come unto the       School in the morning at seven of the clock, both winter and       summer, and tarry there until eleven; and return against one       of the clock, and depart at five, &c. In the school, no time       in the year, they shall use tallow candle in no wise, but       _only wax candle_, at the costs of their friends. Also I       will they bring no meat nor drink, nor bottle, nor use in       the school no breakfasts, nor drinkings, in the time of       learning, in no wise, &c. I will they use no cockfightings,       nor riding about of victory, nor disputing at Saint       Bartholomew, which is but foolish babbling and loss of       time.\" The master is then restricted, under the penalty of       40 shillings, from granting the boys a holiday, or \"remedy,\"       [play-day,] as it is here called \"except the King, an       Archbishop, or a Bishop, present in his own person in the       school, desire it.\" The studies for the lads were,       \"Erasmus's Copia & Institutum Christiani Hominis (composed       at the Dean's request) Lactantius, Prudentius, Juvencus,       Proba and Sedulius, and Baptista Mantuanus, and such other       as shall be thought convenient and most to purpose unto the       true Latin speech: all barbary, all corruption, all Latin       adulterate, which ignorant blind fools brought into this       world, and with the same hath distained and poisoned the old       Latin speech, and the _veray_ Roman tongue, which in the       time of Tully and Sallust and Virgil and Terence was used--I       say that filthiness, and all such abusion, which the later       blind world brought in, which more rather may be called       _Bloterature_ that [Transcriber's Note: than] _Literature_,       I utterly banish and exclude out of this school.\" _Life of       Knight's Colet_, 362-4.         What was to be expected, but that boys, thus educated, would       hereafter fall victims to the BIBLIOMANIA?]         [Footnote 22: The history of this great men [Transcriber's       Note: man], and of his literary labours, is most       interesting. He was a pupil of William Lilly, the first       head-master of St. Paul's School; and, by the kindness and       liberality of a Mr. Myles, he afterwards received the       advantage of a College education, and was supplied with       money in order to travel abroad, and make such collections       as he should deem necessary for the great work which even       then seemed to dawn upon his young and ardent mind. Leland       endeavoured to requite the kindness of his benefactor by an       elegant copy of Latin verses, in which he warmly expatiates       on the generosity of his patron, and acknowledges that his       acquaintance with the _Almae Matres_ [for he was of both       Universities] was entirely the result of such beneficence.       While he resided on the continent, he was admitted into the       society of the most eminent Greek and Latin Scholars, and       could probably number among his correspondents the       illustrious names of Budaeus, Erasmus, the Stephani, Faber       and Turnebus. Here, too, he cultivated his natural taste for       poetry; and from inspecting the fine BOOKS which the Italian       and French presses had produced, as well as fired by the       love of Grecian learning, which had fled, on the sacking of       Constantinople, to take shelter in the academic bowers of       the Medici, he seems to have matured his plans for carrying       into effect the great work which had now taken full       possession of his mind. He returned to England, resolved to       institute an inquiry into the state of the LIBRARIES,       Antiquities, Records and Writings then in existence. Having       entered into holy orders, and obtained preferment at the       express interposition of the King, (Henry VIII.), he was       appointed his Antiquary and Library Keeper, and a royal       commission was issued in which Leland was directed to search       after \"ENGLAND'S ANTIQUITIES, and peruse the LIBRARIES of       all Cathedrals, Abbies, Priories, Colleges, etc., as also       all the places wherein Records, Writings, and Secrets of       Antiquity were reposited.\" \"Before Leland's time,\" says       Hearne, in the Preface to the Itinerary, \"all the literary       monuments of Antiquity were totally disregarded; and       Students of Germany, apprised of this culpable indifference,       were suffered to enter our libraries unmolested, and to cut       out of the books deposited there whatever passages they       thought proper--which they afterwards published as relics of       the ancient literature of their own country.\"         Leland was occupied, without intermission, in this immense       undertaking, for the space of six years; and, on its       completion, he hastened to the metropolis to lay at the feet       of his Sovereign the result of his researches. This was       presented to Henry under the title of A NEW YEAR'S GIFT; and       was first published by Bale in 1549, 8vo. \"Being inflamed,\"       says the author, \"with a love to see thoroughly all those       parts of your opulent and ample realm, in so much that all       my other occupations intermitted, I have so travelled in       your dominions, both by the sea coasts and the middle parts,       sparing neither labour nor costs, by the space of six years       past, that there is neither cape nor bay, haven, creek, or       pier, river, or confluence of rivers, breeches, wastes,       lakes, moors, fenny waters, mountains, vallies, heaths,       forests, chases, woods, cities, burghes, castles, principal       manor places, monasteries and colleges, but I have seen       them; and noted, in so doing, a whole world"]]]
