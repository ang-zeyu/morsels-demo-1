Felicity tossed her beautiful golden head.    \"I told you I wasn't going to make any resolutions. Go on yourself.\"    \"I shall always study my grammar lesson,\" I wrote--I, who loathed  grammar with a deadly loathing.    \"I hate grammar too,\" sighed Sara Ray. \"It seems so unimportant.\"    Sara was rather fond of a big word, but did not always get hold of the  right one. I rather suspected that in the above instance she really  meant uninteresting.    \"I won't get mad at Felicity, if I can help it,\" wrote Dan.    \"I'm sure I never do anything to make you mad,\" exclaimed Felicity.    \"I don't think it's polite to make resolutions about your sisters,\" said  Peter.    \"He can't keep it anyway,\" scoffed Felicity. \"He's got such an awful  temper.\"    \"It's a family failing,\" flashed Dan, breaking his resolution ere the  ink on it was dry.    \"There you go,\" taunted Felicity.    \"I'll work all my arithmetic problems without any help,\" scribbled  Felix.    \"I wish I could resolve that, too,\" sighed Sara Ray, \"but it wouldn't be  any use. I'd never be able to do those compound multiplication sums the  teacher gives us to do at home every night if I didn't get Judy Pineau  to help me. Judy isn't a good reader and she can't spell AT ALL, but you  can't stick her in arithmetic as far as she went herself. I feel sure,\"  concluded poor Sara, in a hopeless tone, \"that I'll NEVER be able to  understand compound multiplication.\"                \"'Multiplication is vexation,                 Division is as bad,             The rule of three perplexes me,                 And fractions drive me mad,'\"      quoted Dan.    \"I haven't got as far as fractions yet,\" sighed Sara, \"and I hope I'll  be too big to go to school before I do. I hate arithmetic, but I am  PASSIONATELY fond of geography.\"    \"I will not play tit-tat-x on the fly leaves of my hymn book in church,\"  wrote Peter.    \"Mercy, did you ever do such a thing?\" exclaimed Felicity in horror.    Peter nodded shamefacedly.    \"Yes--that Sunday Mr. Bailey preached. He was so long-winded, I got  awful tired, and, anyway, he was talking about things I couldn't  understand, so I played tit-tat-x with one of the Markdale boys. It was  the day I was sitting up in the gallery.\"    \"Well, I hope if you ever do the like again you won't do it in OUR pew,\"  said Felicity severely.    \"I ain't going to do it at all,\" said Peter. \"I felt sort of mean all  the rest of the day.\"    \"I shall try not to be vexed when people interrupt me when I'm telling  stories,\" wrote the Story Girl. \"but it will be hard,\" she added with a  sigh.    \"I never mind being interrupted,\" said Felicity.    \"I shall try to be cheerful and smiling all the time,\" wrote Cecily.    \"You are, anyway,\" said Sara Ray loyally.    \"I don't believe we ought to be cheerful ALL the time,\" said the Story  Girl. \"The Bible says we ought to weep with those who weep.\"    \"But maybe it means that we're to weep cheerfully,\" suggested Cecily.    \"Sorter as if you were thinking, 'I'm very sorry for you but I'm mighty  glad I'm not in the scrape too,'\" said Dan.    \"Dan, don't be irreverent,\" rebuked Felicity.    \"I know a story about old Mr. and Mrs. Davidson of Markdale,\" said  the Story Girl. \"She was always smiling and it used to aggravate her  husband, so one day he said very crossly, 'Old lady, what ARE you  grinning at?' 'Oh, well, Abiram, everything's so bright and pleasant,  I've just got to smile.'    \"Not long after there came a time when everything went wrong--the crop  failed and their best cow died, and Mrs. Davidson had rheumatism; and  finally Mr. Davidson fell and broke his leg. But still Mrs. Davidson  smiled. 'What in the dickens are you grinning about now, old lady?'  he demanded. 'Oh, well, Abiram,' she said, 'everything is so dark and  unpleasant I've just got to smile.' 'Well,' said the old man crossly, 'I  think you might give your face a rest sometimes.'\"    \"I shall not talk gossip,\" wrote Sara Ray with a satisfied air.    \"Oh, don't you think that's a little TOO strict?\" asked Cecily  anxiously. \"Of course, it's not right to talk MEAN gossip, but the  harmless kind doesn't hurt. If I say to you that Emmy MacPhail is going  to get a new fur collar this winter, THAT is harmless gossip, but if I  say I don't see how Emmy MacPhail can afford a new fur collar when her  father can't pay my father for the oats he got from him, that would be  MEAN gossip. If I were you, Sara, I'd put MEAN gossip.\"    Sara consented to this amendment.    \"I will be polite to everybody,\" was my third resolution, which passed  without comment.    \"I'll try not to use slang since Cecily doesn't like it,\" wrote Dan.    \"I think some slang is real cute,\" said Felicity.    \"The Family Guide says it's very vulgar,\" grinned Dan. \"Doesn't it, Sara  Stanley?\"    \"Don't disturb me,\" said the Story Girl dreamily. \"I'm just thinking a  beautiful thought.\"    \"I've thought of a resolution to make,\" cried Felicity. \"Mr. Marwood  said last Sunday we should always try to think beautiful thoughts and  then our lives would be very beautiful. So I shall resolve to think a  beautiful thought every morning before breakfast.\"    \"Can you only manage one a day?\" queried Dan.    \"And why before breakfast?\" I asked.    \"Because it's easier to think on an empty stomach,\" said Peter, in all  good faith. But Felicity shot a furious glance at him.    \"I selected that time,\" she explained with dignity, \"because when I'm  brushing my hair before my glass in the morning I'll see my resolution  and remember it.\"    \"Mr. Marwood meant that ALL our thoughts ought to be beautiful,\" said  the Story Girl. \"If they were, people wouldn't be afraid to say what  they think.\"    \"They oughtn't to be afraid to, anyhow,\" said Felix stoutly. \"I'm going  to make a resolution to say just what I think always.\"    \"And do you expect to get through the year alive if you do?\" asked Dan.    \"It might be easy enough to say what you think if you could always be  sure just what you DO think,\" said the Story Girl. \"So often I can't be  sure.\"    \"How would you like it if people always said just what they think to  you?\" asked Felicity.    \"I'm not very particular what SOME people think of me,\" rejoined Felix.    \"I notice you don't like to be told by anybody that you're fat,\"  retorted Felicity.    \"Oh, dear me, I do wish you wouldn't all say such sarcastic things to  each other,\" said poor Cecily plaintively. \"It sounds so horrid the last  night of the old year. Dear knows where we'll all be this night next  year. Peter, it's your turn.\"    \"I will try,\" wrote Peter, \"to say my prayers every night regular, and  not twice one night because I don't expect to have time the next,--like  I did the night before the party,\" he added.    \"I s'pose you never said your prayers until we got you to go to church,\"  said Felicity--who had had no hand in inducing Peter to go to church,  but had stoutly opposed it, as recorded in the first volume of our  family history.    \"I did, too,\" said Peter. \"Aunt Jane taught me to say my prayers. Ma  hadn't time, being as father had run away; ma had to wash at night same  as in day-time.\"    \"I shall learn to cook,\" wrote the Story Girl, frowning.    \"You'd better resolve not to make puddings of--\" began Felicity, then  stopped as suddenly as if she had bitten off the rest of her sentence  and swallowed it. Cecily had nudged her, so she had probably remembered  the Story Girl's threat that she would never tell another story if she  was ever twitted with the pudding she had made from sawdust. But we all  knew what Felicity had started to say and the Story Girl dealt her a  most uncousinly glance.    \"I will not cry because mother won't starch my aprons,\" wrote Sara Ray.    \"Better resolve not to cry about anything,\" said Dan kindly.    Sara Ray shook her head forlornly.    \"That would be too hard to keep. There are times when I HAVE to cry.  It's a relief.\"    \"Not to the folks who have to hear you,\" muttered Dan aside to Cecily.    \"Oh, hush,\" whispered Cecily back. \"Don't go and hurt her feelings the  last night of the old year. Is it my turn again? Well, I'll resolve not  to worry because my hair is not curly. But, oh, I'll never be able to  help wishing it was.\"    \"Why don't you curl it as you used to do, then?\" asked Dan.    \"You know very well that I've never put my hair up in curl papers since  the time Peter was dying of the measles,\" said Cecily reproachfully. \"I  resolved then I wouldn't because I wasn't sure it was quite right.\"    \"I will keep my finger-nails neat and clean,\" I wrote. \"There, that's  four resolutions. I'm not going to make any more. Four's enough.\"    \"I shall always think twice before I speak,\" wrote Felix.    \"That's an awful waste of time,\" commented Dan, \"but I guess you'll need  to if you're always going to say what you think.\"    \"I'm going to stop with three,\" said Peter.    \"I will have all the good times I can,\" wrote the Story Girl.    \"THAT'S what I call sensible,\" said Dan.    \"It's a very easy resolution to keep, anyhow,\" commented Felix.    \"I shall try to like reading the Bible,\" wrote Sara Ray.    \"You ought to like reading the Bible without trying to,\" exclaimed  Felicity.    \"If you had to read seven chapters of it every time you were naughty I  don't believe you would like it either,\" retorted Sara Ray with a flash  of spirit.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#6)"],[1,"in  sheer self-preservation.\"    \"In other words,\" I said, laughing loudly, \"if I scare that Allison  stuffed-shirt he may start stirring in his grave?\"    Forth coughed and smothered a laugh and said that was one way of putting  it. I clapped him reassuringly on the shoulder and said, \"Forget it,  sir. I promise to be godly, sober and industrious--but is there any law  against enjoying what I'm doing?\"    Somebody burst out of the warehouse-palace place, and shouted at me.  \"Jason? The guide is here,\" and I stood up, giving Forth a final grin.  \"Don't you worry. Jay Allison's good riddance,\" I said, and went back to  meet the other guide they had chosen.    And I almost backed out when I saw the guide. For the guide was a woman.    She was small for a Darkovan girl, and narrowly built, the sort of body  that could have been called boyish or coltish but certainly not, at  first glance, feminine. Close-cut curls, blue-black and wispy, cast the  faintest of shadows over a squarish sunburnt face, and her eyes were so  thickly rimmed with heavy dark lashes that I could not guess their  color. Her nose was snubbed and might have looked whimsical and was  instead oddly arrogant. Her mouth was wide, and her chin round, and  altogether I dismissed her as not at all a pretty woman.    She held up her palm and said rather sullenly, \"Kyla-Raineach, free  Amazon, licensed guide.\"    I acknowledged the gesture with a nod, scowling. The guild of free  Amazons entered virtually every masculine field, but that of mountain  guide seemed somewhat bizarre even for an Amazon. She seemed wiry and  agile enough, her body, under the heavy blanket-like clothing, almost as  lean of hip and flat of breast as my own; only the slender long legs  were unequivocally feminine.    The other men were checking and loading supplies; I noted from the  corner of my eye that Regis Hastur was taking his turn heaving bundles  with the rest. I sat down on some still-undisturbed sacks, and motioned  her to sit.    \"You've had trail experience? We're going into the Hellers through  Dammerung, and that's rough going even for professionals.\"           *       *       *       *       *    She said in a flat expressionless voice, \"I was with the Terran Mapping  expedition to the South Polar ridge last year.\"    \"Ever been in the Hellers? If anything happened to me, could you lead  the expedition safely back to Carthon?\"    She looked down at her stubby fingers. \"I'm sure I could,\" she said  finally, and started to rise. \"Is that all?\"    \"One thing more--\" I gestured to her to stay put. \"Kyla, you'll be one  woman among eight men--\"    The snubbed nose wrinkled up; \"I don't expect you to crawl into my  blankets, if that's what you mean. It's not in my contract--I hope!\"    I felt my face burning. Damn the girl! \"It's not in mine, anyway,\" I  snapped, \"but I can't answer for seven other men, most of them mountain  roughnecks!\" Even as I said it I wondered why I bothered; certainly a  free Amazon could defend her own virtue, or not, if she wanted to,  without any help from me. I had to excuse myself by adding, \"In either  case you'll be a disturbing element--I don't want fights, either!\"    She made a little low-pitched sound of amusement. \"There's safety in  numbers, and--are you familiar with the physiological effect of high  altitudes on men acclimated to low ones?\" Suddenly she threw back her  head and the hidden sound became free and merry laughter. \"Jason, I'm a  free Amazon, and that means--no, I'm not neutered, though some of us  are. But you have my word, I won't create any trouble of any  recognizably female variety.\" She stood up. \"Now, if you don't mind, I'd  like to check the mountain equipment.\"    Her eyes were still laughing at me, but curiously I didn't mind at all.  There was a refreshing element in her manner.           *       *       *       *       *    We started that night, a curiously lopsided little caravan. The pack  animals were loaded into one truck and didn't like it. We had another  stripped-down truck which carried supplies. The ancient stone roads,  rutted and gullied here and there with the flood-waters and silt of  decades, had not been planned for any travel other than the feet of men  or beasts. We passed tiny villages and isolated country estates, and a  few of the solitary towers where the matrix mechanics worked alone with  the secret sciences of Darkover, towers of glareless stone which  sometimes shone like blue beacons in the dark.    Kendricks drove the truck which carried the animals, and was amused by  it. Rafe and I took turns driving the other truck, sharing the wide  front seat with Regis Hastur and the girl Kyla, while the other men  found seats between crates and sacks in the back. Once while Rafe was at  the wheel and the girl dozing with her coat over her face to shut out  the fierce sun, Regis asked me, \"What are the trailcities like?\"    I tried to tell him, but I've never been good at boiling things down  into descriptions, and when he found I was not disposed to talk, he fell  silent and I was free to drowse over what I knew of the trailmen and  their world.    Nature seems to have a sameness on all inhabited worlds, tending toward  the economy and simplicity of the human form. The upright carriage,  freeing the hands, the opposable thumb, the color-sensitivity of retinal  rods and cones, the development of language and of lengthy parental  nurture--these things seem to be indispensable to the growth of  civilization, and in the end they spell _human_. Except for minor  variations depending on climate or foodstuff, the inhabitant of Megaera  or Darkover is indistinguishable from the Terran or Sirian; differences  are mainly cultural, and sometimes an isolated culture will mutate in a  strange direction or remain, atavists, somewhere halfway to the summit  of the ladder of evolution--which, at least on the known planets, still  reckons homo sapiens as the most complex of nature's forms.    The trailmen were a pausing-place which had proved tenacious. When the  mainstream of evolution on Darkover left the trees to struggle for  existence on the ground, a few remained behind. Evolution did not cease  for them, but evolved _homo arborens_; nocturnal, nystalopic humanoids  who lived out their lives in the extensive forests.    The truck bumped over the bad, rutted roads. The wind was chilly--the  truck, a mere conveyance for hauling, had no such refinements of luxury  as windows. I jolted awake--what nonsense had I been thinking? Vague  ideas about evolution swirled in my brain like burst bubbles--the  trailmen? They were just the trailmen, who could explain them? Jay  Allison, maybe? Rafe turned his head and asked, \"Where do we pull up for  the night? It's getting dark, and we have all this gear to sort!\" I  roused myself, and took over the business of the expedition again.    But when the trucks had been parked and a tent pitched and the pack  animals unloaded and hobbled, and a start made at getting the gear  together--when all this had been done I lay awake, listening to  Kendricks' heavy snoring, but myself afraid to sleep. Dozing in the  truck, an odd lapse of consciousness had come over me ... myself yet not  myself, drowsing over thoughts I did not recognize as my own. If I  slept, who would I be when I woke?           *       *       *       *       *    We had made our camp in the bend of an enormous river, wide and shallow  and unbridged; the river Kadarin, traditionally a point of no return for  humans on Darkover. The river is fed by ocean tides and we would have to  wait for low water to cross. Beyond the river lay thick forests, and  beyond the forests the slopes of the Hellers, rising upward and upward;  and their every fold and every valley was filled to the brim with  forest, and in the forests lived the trailmen.    But though all this country was thickly populated with outlying colonies  and nests, it would be no use to bargain with any of them; we must deal  with the Old One of the North Nest, where I had spent so many of my  boyhood years.    From time immemorial, the trailmen--usually inoffensive--had kept strict  boundaries marked between their lands and the lands of ground-dwelling  men. They never came beyond the Kadarin. On the other hand, almost any  human who ventured into their territory became, by that act, fair game  for attack.    A few of the Darkovan mountain people had trade treaties with the  trailmen; they traded clothing, forged metals, small implements, in  return for nuts, bark for dyestuffs and certain leaves and mosses for  drugs. In return, the trailmen permitted them to hunt in the forest  lands without being molested. But other humans, venturing into trailman  territory, ran the risk of merciless raiding; the trailmen were not  bloodthirsty, and did not kill for the sake of killing, but they  attacked in packs of two or three dozen, and their prey would be  stripped and plundered of everything portable.    Travelling through their country would be dangerous....           *       *       *       *       *    The sun was high before we struck the camp. While the others were  packing up the last oddments, ready for the saddle, I gave the girl Kyla  the task of readying the rucksacks we'd carry after the trails got too  bad even for the pack animals, and went to stand at the water's edge,  checking the depth of the ford and glancing up at the smoke-hazed rifts  between peak and peak.    The men were packing up the small tent we'd use in the forests, moving  around with a good deal of horseplay and a certain brisk bustle. They  were a good crew, I'd already discovered. Rafe and Lerrys and the three  Darkovan brothers were tireless, cheerful and mountain-hardened.  Kendricks, obviously out of his element, could be implicitly relied on  to follow orders, and I felt that I could fall back on him. Strange as  it seemed, the very fact that he was a Terran was vaguely "]]]
