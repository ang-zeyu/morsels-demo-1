Using knitting-worsted, or yarn of any desired size or  quality with needles to correspond, such as would be employed for a  man's knitted sock, cast 18 to 22 stitches on each of 3 needles, and  knit 2, purl 2, alternately, for 35 rows or more, according to length  required. Bind off loosely.    With bone crochet-hook work in straight rows from top to bottom, putting  a treble in every other stitch and 2 chain-stitches between trebles;  after the last treble at the edge chain 2, miss a row and return on the  next.    Having completed the rows of spaces, make 2 trebles in 1st space, 3 in  next, and repeat, working back and forth until all the spaces are  filled. A very attractive finish is to work a row of doubles in color,  making a double in each treble. With fine wool, crochet-silk may be  prettily used for this finish.    A fringed wrister may be made on the foundation described by holding a  pencil on lengthwise with the left hand, and with the right sewing over  and over it; make the rows quite close together, cut the wound yarn open  with a pair of sharp scissors, and brush lightly across it, back and  forth, until the cut ends become \"mossy\" or fluffed up.          Motor-Scarf      [Illustration: Motor-Scarf]    This motor-scarf may be of pink and white, or any preferred colors of  Shetland floss. Use wooden needles and cast on 100 stitches with pink.    1, 3. Purl.    2. Knit plain.    4. Knit 3, over twice, narrow; repeat across, ending with knit 3.    5. Purl, dropping 2d of the over-twice loops.    6. Knit plain.    7, 9. With white, purl.    8, 10. Knit plain.    Repeat until the scarf is of the length required. The sides are finished  with shells, in white, making 8 trebles, well drawn out, in the center  of the pink stripe, and fastening in center of white stripe with 1  double.    Finish the ends with fringe knotted in, six inches long and composed of  10 threads each of pink and white.          Sport Scarf      [Illustration: Sport Scarf]    A very attractive scarf uses brown Shetland as a body color, with deep  cream-color, green and rose in combination with the brown for stripes.  Using No. 3 1/2 or No. 4 bone needles, cast on 84 stitches and knit back  and forth for 64 rows or 32 ribs; then join in the cream-color and knit  (4 rows of cream, 2 rows of brown) 5 times, 10 rows of cream, (2 of  brown, 4 of cream) 5 times; 64 rows of brown; join in green, (4 rows of  green, 2 of brown) 3 times; 10 rows of green; (2 of brown, 4 of green) 3  times; 64 rows of brown; (4 of rose, 2 of brown) 3 times; 10 of rose; (2  of brown, 4 of rose) 3 times; * 64 rows of brown. Reverse from *, making  the other end of scarf as directed for first half.    For the fringe, cut strands of brown six inches long, and knot a strand  in each stitch.    For a lighter scarf use No. 4 bone needles and cast on 48 or 50  stitches. The larger needles with loose knitting will give work much  more open. If desired one may introduce rows of fancy knitting instead  of the colored stripes. In fact, having made one scarf, the worker will  find it possible to vary it in many ways, and will find such variation a  pleasing study.    Many like to use a thread of silk or mercerized crochet-cotton with the  Shetland floss or other wool which may be chosen.          Scarf in Lattice-Stitch      [Illustration: Scarf in Lattice-Stitch]    Using Shetland floss and No. 4 bone needles, cast on as many stitches as  required for width of scarf, using a multiple of 6 with 2 over.    Knit back and forth 6 times.    7. Knit 1, over 3 times; repeat, knitting last stitch.    8. Knit 1, draw up the loop about one inch in length, (drop the \"overs,\"  and slip the knitted stitch) 6 times, slip the 6 long stitches to  left-hand needle, draw the last 3 over 1st 3, knitting each, then knit  the 1st 3, and repeat, knitting 1 at end of row. Take care the long  stitches are not twisted.    9. 10, 11. Knit plain.    Repeat from 7th row.    Gather up the ends of the scarf and finish with cord and tassel, or a  bow of ribbon, as preferred.          Knitting for the Red Cross    (Official Red Cross Photographs)      Sleeveless Sweater    [Illustration: Sleeveless Sweater]    Three hanks of gray or khaki knitting-yarn (3/4 pound), fivefold, and a  pair of amber needles No. 5, or No. 3 Red Cross needles will be needed;  11 stitches should measure two inches.

[Illustration: Sleeveless Sweater before Sides Are Sewed Together]      Washcloth    [Illustration: Washcloth]    White knitting-cotton (medium weight); 1 pair Red Cross needles No. 1.    Cast on 70 stitches, knit back and forth plain until cloth is about 10  inches square, and bind off. Sew a loop of tape to one corner.      Service Sock    [Illustration: Service Sock]    A service-sock requires three skeins of knitting-yarn for two pairs,  with No. 11 steel needles. Cast on 24 stitches on each of 2 needles, and  20 on the 3d. Knit 2 and purl 2 for 3 1/2 inches.    Knit 10, or halfway across the 3d needle, pick up an extra stitch and  purl it, keeping this always for the seam-stitch at back of leg, knit  plain to end of round. Continue knitting plain and purling the seam  stitch for four inches.    Knit to within 3 stitches of the seam-stitch, narrow, knit 1, purl the  seam-stitch, knit 1, slip 1, knit 1, draw the slipped stitch over, and  knit plain to end of round. Repeat, narrowing as directed every 6th  round, 4 times. Now knit without decreasing for one inch.    For the heel: Place 15 stitches each side of the middle or seam-stitch,  and knit back and forth, 1 row plain and 1 purl, alternately, for 25  rows, always slipping the 1st stitch. To turn the heel, slip the 1st  stitch, knit 15, narrow, knit 1, turn work; slip 1, purl 2, purl 2  together, purl 1, turn, slip 1, knit 3, narrow, knit 1, turn; slip 1,  purl 4, purl 2 together, purl 1, turn; slip 1, knit 5, narrow, knit 1,  turn; slip 1, purl 6, purl 2 together, purl 1, turn; slip 1, knit 7,  narrow, knit 1, turn; slip 1, purl 8, purl 2 together, purl 1, turn;  slip 1, knit 9, narrow, knit 1, turn; slip 1, purl 10, purl 2 together,  purl 1, turn; slip 1, knit 11, narrow, knit 1, turn; slip 1, purl 12,  purl 2 together, purl 1, turn; slip 1, knit 13, narrow, knit 1, turn;  slip 1, purl 14, purl 2 together, purl 1, turn; slip 1, knit 14, narrow.  Proceed to pick up 17 stitches down side of heel next to needle just  finished, knitting each as you pick it up; knit the 30 left on the  needle for front of foot, and pick up 17 down other side of heel; then  knit on with these half the stitches left at top of heel.    Knit 1 round plain; narrow the 2d round as follows: On 1st side needle  knit to within 3 of end, narrow, knit 1; knit across front needle; on  side needle knit 1, slip 1, knit 1, pass slipped stitch over, and knit  to end. Decrease in this manner every 2d round until there are 15  stitches on each side needle, reducing them to correspond with the front  needle, and making 10 narrowings for the instep.    Knit five inches without narrowing, then decrease for the toe in the  following manner: Knit to within 3 of end of 1st side needle, narrow,  knit 1; on front needle, knit 1, slip and bind as before, knit to within  3 of the end, narrow, knit 1; on other side needle, knit 1, slip and  bind, knit plain to the end. Knit 2 rounds plain, and repeat last 3  rounds three times more; then decrease with 1 row plain between three  times, and after that decrease every row until there are but 4 stitches  on the front needle. Finish off neatly, drawing the toe together and  darning in with a worsted-needle.

Knit plain for 8 inches for front piece,  and leave on extra needle. Knit another piece to correspond for back.  These pieces must be at least 9 inches wide. Slip the stitches of both  pieces on to 3 needles, arranging for last 2 stitches of back piece to  be on beginning of 1st needle, with 38 stitches of front piece added  (making 40 on 1st needle).    Divide rest of stitches on other 2 needles; 36--36.    Beginning with 1st needle, knit 2, purl 2 for 6 inches. Then on 1st  needle knit 2, purl 2 for 18 stitches. Bind off 22 stitches for face  opening. (Try to keep same arrangement of stitches on needles for  further directions.) Knit 2, purl 2 forward and back on remaining 90  stitches for 1 1/2 inches, always slipping first stitch. Cast on 22  stitches loosely to complete face opening, and knit 2, purl 2 for 2 1/2  inches (adjust stitches by slipping 2 from end of 3d needle to 1st  needle, making 42 on 1st needle).

This, with the Hindoo, is the chastity of his wives; a point without  which he must not live.    In the midst of slaughter and devastation, throughout all the East, the  harem is a sanctuary. Ruffians, covered with the blood of a husband,  shrink back with veneration from the secret apartment of his wives.    At Constantinople, when the sultan sends an order to strangle a  state-criminal, and seize on his effects, the officers who execute it  enter not into the harem, nor touch any thing belonging to the women.    Every Turkish seraglio and harem, has a garden adjoining to it, and in  the middle of this garden a large room, more or less decorated according  to the wealth of the proprietor. Here the ladies spend most of their  time, with their attendant nymphs around them employed at their music,  embroidery, or loom.    It has long been a custom among the grandees of Asia, to entertain  story-tellers of both sexes, who like the _bards_ of ancient Europe,  divert them with tales, and little histories, mostly on the subject of  bravery and love. These often amuse the women, and beguile the cheerless  hours of the harem, by calling up images to their minds which their eyes  are forever debarred from seeing.    All their other amusements, as well as this, are indolently voluptuous.  They spend a great part of their time in lolling on skien sofas; while a  train of female slaves, scarcely less voluptuous, attend to sing to  them, to fan them, and to rub their bodies; an exercise which the  Easterns enjoy, with a sort of placid ecstasy, as it promotes the  circulation of their languid blood.    They bathe themselves in rose water and other baths, prepared with the  precious odors of the East. They perfume themselves with costly  essences, and adorn their persons, that they may please the _tyrant_  with whom they are obliged to live.      CHINESE WOMAN.    Of all the other Asiatics, the Chinese have, perhaps the best title to  modesty. Even the men wrap themselves closely up in their garments, and  reckon it indecent to discover any more of their arms and legs than is  necessary.--The women, still more closely wrapt up, never discover a  naked hand even to their nearest relations, if they can possibly avoid  it. Every part of their dress, every part of their behavior is  calculated to preserve decency, and inspire respect. And, what adds  lustre to of their charms, is that uncommon modesty which appears in  every look and in every action.    Charmed, no doubt, with so engaging a deportment, the men behave to them  in a reciprocal manner. And, that their virtue may not be contaminated  by the neighborhood of vice, the legislature takes care that no  prostitutes shall lodge within the walls of any of the great cities of  China.    Some, however, suspect whether this appearance of modesty be any thing  else than the custom of the country; and allege that, notwithstanding  so much decency and decorum, they have their peculiar modes of  intriguing, and embrace every possible opportunity of putting them in  practice; and that, in these intrigues, they frequently scruple not to  stab the paramour they had invited to their arms, as the surest method  of preventing detection and loss of character.    A bridegroom knows nothing of the character or person of his intended  wife, except what he gathers from the report of some female relative, or  confidant, who undertakes to arrange the marriage, and determine the sum  that shall be paid for the bride. Very severe laws are made to prevent  deception and fraud in these transactions. On the day appointed for the  wedding the damsel is placed in a close palanquin the key of which is  sent to the bridegroom, by the hands of some trusty domestic. Her  relations and friends accompanied by squalling music, escort her to his  house; at the gate of which he stands in full dress, ready to receive  her. He eagerly opens the palanquin and examines his bargain. If he is  pleased, she enters his dwelling, and the marriage is celebrated with  feasting and rejoicing; the men and women being all the time in separate  apartments. If the bridegroom is dissatisfied, he shuts the palanquin,  and sends the woman back to her relations; but when this happens, he  must pay another sum of money equal to the price he first gave for her.  A woman who unites beauty with accomplishments brings from four to seven  hundred louis d'ors; some sell for less than one hundred. The apartments  of the women are separated from those of the men by a wall at which a  guard is stationed. The wife is never allowed to eat with her husband;  she cannot quit her apartments without permission; and he does not enter  hers without first asking leave. Brothers are entirely separated from  their sisters at the age of nine or ten years.      AFRICAN WOMEN.    The Africans were formerly renowned for their industry in cultivating  the ground, for their trade, navigation, caravans and useful arts.--At  present they are remarkable for their idleness, ignorance, superstition,  treachery, and, above all, for their lawless methods of robbing and  murdering all the other inhabitants of the globe.    Though they still retain some sense of their infamous character, yet  they do not choose to reform. Their priests, therefore, endeavor to  justify them, by the following story: \"Noah,\" say they, \"was no sooner  dead, than his three sons, the first of whom was _white_, the second  _tawny_, and the third _black_, having agreed upon dividing among them  his goods and possessions, spent the greatest part of the day in sorting  them; so that they were obliged to adjourn the division till the next  morning. Having supped and smoked a friendly pipe together, they all  went to rest, each in his own tent. After a few hours sleep, the white  brother got up, seized on the gold, silver, precious stones, and other  things of the greatest value, loaded the best horses with them, and rode  away to that country where his white posterity have been settled ever  since. The tawny, awaking soon after, and with the same criminal  intention, was surprised when he came to the store house to find that  his brother had been beforehand with him. Upon which he hastily secured  the rest of the horses and camels, and loading them with the best  carpets, clothes, and other remaining goods, directed his route to  another part of the world, leaving behind him, only a few of the  coarsest goods, and some provisions of little value.    When the third, or black brother, came next morning in the simplicity of  his heart to make the proposed division, and could neither find his  brethren, nor any of the valuable commodities, he easily judged they had  tricked him, and were by that time fled beyond any possibility of  discovery.    In this most afflicted situation, he took his _pipe_, and begun to  consider the most effectual means of retrieving his loss, and being  revenged on his perfidious brothers.    After revolving a variety of schemes in his mind, he at last fixed upon  watching every opportunity of making reprisals on them, and laying hold  of and carrying away their property, as often as it should fall in his  way, in revenge for that patrimony of which they had so unjustly  deprived him.    Having come to this resolution, he not only continued in the practice of  it all his life, but on his death laid the strongest injunctions on his  descendants to do so, to the end of the world.\"    Some tribes of the Africans, however, when they have engaged themselves  in the protection of a stranger, are remarkable for fidelity. Many of  them are conspicuous for their temperance, hospitality, and several  other virtues.    Their women, upon the whole, are far from being indelicate or unchaste.  On the banks of the Niger, they are tolerably industrious, have a  considerable share of vivacity, and at the same time a female reserve,  which would do no discredit to a politer country. They are modest,  affable, and faithful; an air of innocence appears in their looks and in  their language, which gives a beauty to their whole deportment.    When, from the Niger, we approach toward the East, the African women  degenerate in stature, complexion, sensibility, and chastity. Even their  language, like their features, and the soil they inhabit, is harsh and  disagreeable. Their pleasures resemble more the transports of fury, than  the gentle emotions communicated by agreeable sensations.      GREAT ENTERPRISES OF WOMEN IN THE TIMES OF CHIVALRY.    The times and the manners of chivalry, by bringing great enterprises,  bold adventures, and extravagant heroism into fashion, inspired the  women with the same taste.    The two sexes always imitate each other. Their manners and their minds  are refined or corrupted, invigorated or dissolved together.    The women, in consequence of the prevailing passion, were now seen in  the middle of camps and of armies. They quitted the soft and tender  inclinations, and the delicate offices of their own sex, for the  courage, and the toilsome occupations of ours.    During the crusades, animated by the double enthusiasm of religion and  of valor, they often performed the most romantic exploits. They  obtained indulgences on the field of battle, and died with arms in their  hands, by the side of their lovers, or of their husbands.    In Europe, the women attacked and defended fortifications. Princesses  commanded their armies, and obtained victories.    Such was the celebrated Joan de Mountfort, disputing for her duchy of  Bretagne, and engaging the enemy herself.    Such was the still more celebrated Margaret of Anjou, queen of England  and wife of Henry VI. She was active and intrepid, a general and a  soldier. Her genius for a long time supported her feeble husband, taught  him to conquer, replaced him upon the throne, twice"]]]
