The PPP method involves the use of standardized  international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities  of final goods and services produced in a given economy. The data  derived from the PPP method probably provides the best available  starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-being  between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange rate method  involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that  may not capture the value of domestic output. Furthermore, exchange  rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market  forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On  12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial  Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued  their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real  output of these countries by half. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD  countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries  are often rough approximations. In developing countries with weak  currencies, the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically  one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Most of the GDP estimates for  developing countries are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers  published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by  Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of  Pennsylvania and their colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method  should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such  as exports, imports, military expenditures, external debt, or the  current account balance, because the dollar values presented in the  Factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange  rates, not at PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the  proportion of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that  share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.  Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a currency  is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP GDP, the  official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa. However,  there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move  in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in the short- or  medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data should  not be chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because  of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by  statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information,  and changes in national statistical methods and practices.    GNP    Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic  production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather  than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad  may be important to national well-being.    GWP    This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value of  all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Geographic coordinates    This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the  purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and  is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August  1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.    Geographic names    This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of  Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various alternate names,  former names, local names, and regional names referenced to one or more  related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but not always, those  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names and  additional information are included in parentheses.    Geography    This category includes the entries dealing with the natural environment  and the effects of human activity.    Geography - note    This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Gini index    See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index    Government    This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the  adoption and administration of public policy.    Government - note    This entry includes miscellaneous government information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Government type    This entry gives the basic form of government. Definitions of the major  governmental terms are as follows:    Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought  about by the absence of governmental authority.    Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.    Communism - a system of government in which the state plans and  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds  power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private  ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward  a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the  people (i.e., a classless society).    Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority  over all matters except those delegated to the central government.    Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws  and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of  that government.    Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign  power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.    Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is  guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.    Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained  by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a  system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.    Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the  body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives  responsible to them.    Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).    Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.    Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which  the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim  state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.    Federal (Federative) - a form of government in which sovereign power is  formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of  its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central  government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as  upon the regional units.    Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central  government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,  colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate  sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental  representatives.    Islamic republic - a particular form of government adoped by some  Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it  remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the  laws of Islam.    Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China  by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution  is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch  with the people.    Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by  19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as  a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class  struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists  (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"  to, finally, a classless society - Communism.    Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin  from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage  of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed  to underdeveloped countries.    Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the  hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for  life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute  ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with  constitutionally limited authority.    Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group  of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.    Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the legislature  (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or  chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party  strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government  acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the  parliament.    Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a  government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its  leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to  their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly  responsible to it;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2752"],[0,"Martin Guerre (#6)"],[1,"rred, and thought she  had had a frightful dream. She asked if Pierre Guerre had been to see  her, and found he had not been near the house. This could only be  explained by the scene which had taken place, and she then recollected  all the accusation Pierre had made, her own observations which had  confirmed it, all her grief and trouble. She inquired about the village  news. Pierre, evidently, had kept silence why? Had he seen that his  suspicions were unjust, or was he only seeking further evidence? She  sank back into her cruel uncertainty, and resolved to watch Martin  closely, before deciding as to his guilt or innocence.    How was she to suppose that God had created two faces so exactly alike,  two beings precisely similar, and then sent them together into the  world, and on the same track, merely to compass the ruin of an unhappy  woman! A terrible idea took possession of her mind, an idea not uncommon  in an age of superstition, namely, that the Enemy himself could assume  human form, and could borrow the semblance of a dead man in order to  capture another soul for his infernal kingdom. Acting on this idea, she  hastened to the church, paid for masses to be said, and prayed  fervently. She expected every day to see the demon forsake the body he  had animated, but her vows, offerings, and prayers had no result. But  Heaven sent her an idea which she wondered had not occurred to her  sooner. \"If the Tempter,\" she said to herself, \"has taken the form of my  beloved husband, his power being supreme for evil, the resemblance would  be exact, and no difference, however slight, would exist. If, however,  it is only another man who resembles him, God must have made them with  some slight distinguishing marks.\"    She then remembered, what she had not thought of before, having been  quite unsuspicious before her uncle's accusation, and nearly out of her  mind between mental and bodily suffering since. She remembered that on  her husband's left shoulder, almost on the neck, there used to be one of  those small, almost imperceptible, but ineffaceable birthmarks. Martin  wore his hair very long, it was difficult to see if the mark were there  or not. One night, while he slept, Bertrande cut away a lock of hair  from the place where this sign ought to be--it was not there!    Convinced at length of the deception, Bertrande suffered inexpressible  anguish. This man whom she had loved and respected for two whole years,  whom she had taken to her heart as a husband bitterly mourned for--this  man was a cheat, an infamous impostor, and she, all unknowing, was yet a  guilty woman! Her child was illegitimate, and the curse of Heaven was  due to this sacrilegious union. To complete the misfortune, she was  already expecting another infant. She would have killed herself, but her  religion and the love of her children forbade it. Kneeling before her  child's cradle, she entreated pardon from the father of the one for the  father of the other. She would not bring herself to proclaim aloud their  infamy.    \"Oh!\" she said, \"thou whom I loved, thou who art no more, thou knowest  no guilty thought ever entered my mind! When I saw this man, I thought I  beheld thee; when I was happy, I thought I owed it to thee; it was thee  whom I loved in him. Surely thou dost not desire that by a public avowal  I should bring shame and disgrace on these children and on myself.\"    She rose calm and strengthened: it seemed as if a heavenly inspiration  had marked out her duty. To suffer in silence, such was the course she  adopted,--a life of sacrifice and self-denial which she offered to God  as an expiation for her involuntary sin. But who can understand the  workings of the human heart? This man whom she ought to have loathed,  this man who had made her an innocent partner in his crime, this  unmasked impostor whom she should have beheld only with disgust,  she-loved him! The force of habit, the ascendancy he had obtained over  her, the love he had shown her, a thousand sympathies felt in her inmost  heart, all these had so much influence, that, instead of accusing and  cursing him, she sought to excuse him on the plea of a passion to which,  doubtless, he had yielded when usurping the name and place of another.  She feared punishment for him yet more than disgrace for herself, and  though resolved to no longer allow him the rights purchased by crime,  she yet trembled at the idea of losing his love. It was this above all  which decided her to keep eternal silence about her discovery; one  single word which proved that his imposture was known would raise an  insurmountable barrier between them.    To conceal her trouble entirely was, however, beyond her power; her eyes  frequently showed traces of her secret tears. Martin several times asked  the cause of her sorrow; she tried to smile and excuse herself, only  immediately sinking back into her gloomy thoughts. Martin thought it  mere caprice; he observed her loss of colour, her hollow cheeks, and  concluded that age was impairing her beauty, and became less attentive  to her. His absences became longer and more frequent, and he did not  conceal his impatience and annoyance at being watched; for her looks  hung upon his, and she observed his coldness and change with much grief.  Having sacrificed all in order to retain his love, she now saw it slowly  slipping away from her.    Another person also observed attentively. Pierre Guerre since his  explanation with Bertrande had apparently discovered no more evidence,  and did not dare to bring an accusation without some positive proofs.  Consequently he lost no chance of watching the proceedings of his  supposed nephew, silently hoping that chance might put him on the track  of a discovery. He also concluded from Bertrande's state of melancholy  that she had convinced herself of the fraud, but had resolved to conceal  it.    Martin was then endeavoring to sell a part of his property, and this  necessitated frequent interviews with the lawyers of the neighbouring  town. Twice in the week he went to Rieux, and to make the journey  easier, used to start horseback about seven in the evening, sleep at  Rieux, and return the following afternoon. This arrangement did not  escape his enemy's notice, who was not long in convincing himself that  part of the time ostensibly spent on this journey was otherwise  employed.    Towards ten o'clock on the evening of a dark night, the door of a small  house lying about half a gunshot from the village opened gently for the  exit of a man wrapped in a large cloak, followed by a young woman, who  accompanied him some distance. Arrived at the parting point, they  separated with a tender kiss and a few murmured words of adieu; the  lover took his horse, which was fastened to a tree, mounted, and rode  off towards Rieux. When the sounds died away, the woman turned slowly  and sadly towards her home, but as she approached the door a man  suddenly turned the corner of the house and barred her away. Terrified,  she was on the point of crying for help, when he seized her arm and  ordered her to be silent.    \"Rose,\" he whispered, \"I know everything: that man is your lover. In  order to receive him safely, you send your old husband to sleep by means  of a drug stolen from your father's shop. This intrigue has been going  on for a month; twice a week, at seven o'clock, your door is opened to  this man, who does not proceed on his way to the town until ten. I know  your lover: he is my nephew.\"    Petrified with terror, Rose fell on her knees and implored mercy.    \"Yes,\" replied Pierre, \"you may well be frightened: I have your secret.  I have only to publish it and you are ruined for ever:\"    You will not do it! \"entreated the guilty woman, clasping her hands.    \"I have only to tell your husband,\" continued Pierre, \"that his wife has  dishonoured him, and to explain the reason of his unnaturally heavy  sleep.\"    \"He will kill me!\"    \"No doubt: he is jealous, he is an Italian, he will know how to avenge  himself--even as I do.\"    \"But I never did you any harm,\" Rose cried in despair. \"Oh! have pity,  have mercy, and spare me!\"    \"On one condition.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Come with me.\"    Terrified almost out of her mind, Rose allowed him to lead her away.    Bertrande had just finished her evening prayer, and was preparing for  bed, when she was startled by several knocks at her door. Thinking that  perhaps some neighbour was in need of help, she opened it immediately,  and to her astonishment beheld a dishevelled woman whom Pierre grasped  by the arm. He exclaimed vehemently--    \"Here is thy judge! Now, confess all to Bertrande!\"    Bertrande did not at once recognise the woman, who fell at her feet,  overcome by Pierre's threats.    \"Tell the truth here,\" he continued, \"or I go and tell it to your  husband, at your own home!\"--\"Ah! madame, kill me,\" said the unhappy  creature, hiding her face; \"let me rather die by your hand than his!\"    Bertrande, bewildered, did not understand the position in the least, but  she recognised Rose--    \"But what is the matter, madame? Why are you here at this hour, pale and  weeping? Why has my uncle dragged you hither? I am to judge you, does he  say? Of what crime are you guilty?\"    \"Martin might answer that, if he were here,\" remarked Pierre.    A lightning flash of jealousy shot through Bertrande's soul at these  words, all her former suspicions revived.    \"What!\" she said, \"my husband! What do you mean?\"    \"That he left this woman's house only a little while ago, that for a  month they have been meeting secretly. You are betrayed: I have seen  them and she does not dare to deny it.\"    \"Have mercy!\" cried Rose, still kneeling.    The cry was a confession. Bertrande became pate as death. \"O God!\" she  murmured, \"deceived, betrayed--and by him!\"    \"For a month past,\" repeated the old man.    \"Oh! the wretch,\" she continued, with increasing passion; \"then his  whole life"]]]
