Surely, surely, that combination of conditions is the  best for a race or a nation which produces the best individuals; and  quite as surely we should strive to bring about those conditions which  tend to produce the best individuals.    Then there is home. Home, sweet home! the perfect flower, we are told,  that blooms on the fair stem of marriage. Yet it is the very citadel of  ignorance, when it should be the school in which are taught the  beautiful phenomena of physical life. Home! where the simplest, purest  facts of life are converted into a nasty mystery and deliberately  endowed with the characteristics of impurity and sin; for what else is  the meaning of that solemn formula, which most of us have been taught,  that we were conceived in sin? What else is the meaning of the hush and  blush that go to any reference to sex, sign or manifestation of sex? Is  it not awful beyond the power of words to express that a man and a woman  come together in ignorance and beget children who are not even to obtain  the benefit of such knowledge as their unfortunate parents pick up by  the way, but must themselves begin the most responsible functions of  life, not only in equal ignorance, but with an added load of  misconceptions, sex-superstitions, immoral dogmas and probably physical  disabilities? A short time since a father was speaking to me of his son,  fourteen years of age, and plainly at an age when some of the beautiful  phenomena of sex-life were beginning to crowd upon him for notice. I  asked the man if he had talked with his son about the matter. His answer  was peculiar only in that he put into words a description of the  attitude of the average parent: \"Talked to him about that? Not I. Let  him learn as I did. No one ever told me.\" But some one had told him, as  his unpleasantly reminiscent smile advised me! He had been told by  ignorant companions, by ignorant servants, and, quite likely, by books,  whose grossness would have been harmless but for the child's piteous  ignorance. No, the man would not talk with his son about such things,  but he would go into his club and talk into the small hours over a glass  of whiskey with his friends there, turning the beauty and purity of sex  manifestation into shabby jest and impure ridicule. He would exchange  stories based on sex relation with any stranger with whom he might ride  for two hours in a smoking car. Every man knows that I speak well within  bounds.    And the girl child! what of her? Does her mother, the victim of  misinformation and no information, of misuse and self-mutilation, in the  sweet privacy of this home, which is called the cradle of peace and the  nestling place of purity, save her by taking warning of her own ruined  life and giving her the benefit of such little knowledge as she has  gained in physical, mental and moral misery? We know she does not. On  the contrary, the same terrible old lies are told, the same hideous  practices are resorted to; and another poor creature is launched into  that awful life of legalized prostitution which is called marriage.    Motherhood is woman's highest function, and, moreover, it is a function  which it is unwise not to exercise; for it is infinitely more perilous  for a healthy woman not to be a mother than it is for her to bear  children. Motherhood, too, is the most markedly indicated function of a  woman's body. She is specialized for it; it is the thing indicated. And  yet we never say to a woman, Be a mother when you will; we hold up our  hands in horror at the very thought of motherhood itself, and we say,  Marry; marry anything; get another name for yourself; merge your very  identity into that of some man; get a home; never mind about children;  you don't have to have them; they have nothing to do with your  respectability. Is it not so? Is it not so that that woman who prefers  her own name and her freedom, and who exercises her highest function of  motherhood, thereby becomes a thing of scorn and contumely?    And yet, how in this world can a woman do a finer, wiser, braver, truer  thing than to bear a child in freedom by a carefully chosen father? It  is true that we have moralists who urge wives to breed for the good of  the country, but even they, while declaring that it is the duty of women  to have large families, roll their eyes in horror at the thought of a  woman exercising her plainest right, without first having some man,  whose only interest in the matter is his fee, say some magic words over  her and her master.    Oh, that marriage ceremony! And is it not pathetic to hear the women,  dimly conscious of their backbones, declaring that they will not promise  to obey? They will promise vehemently to love and honor, which they  absolutely cannot be sure of doing, but they refuse to obey--the only  thing they could safely promise to do, and which, in fact, most of them  do. For, writhe and twist as they may, defy never so bravely, the  conventions of the world are against them, and conform they must. Down,  down they sink until they are on their knees in the mire of tradition,  their heads bowed to the ugly little fetish. A woman may be a thousand  times the superior of her husband, and yet she must be his slave.    And what puerile fables, what transparent lies are told to reconcile the  poor slave to her lot! A man's rib! And she is the weaker vessel!  Nevertheless, she is the power behind the throne. And if the man  possess her, does she not equally possess him? Is not monogamy the  mainstay of our morals? Is not God to be thanked that he has given us  light to see the horrors of polygamy? Oh, that shocking thing, polygamy!  How the husbands of the land rise up to defend their firesides from it!  No Smoots shall get into our Senate. That virtuous Senate!    Why if every practising polygamist went home from the Congress there  would not be a quorum left to do business. Monogamy! Why it is the most  shocking phase of the hypocrisy due to marriage. There is no such  condition known in this country. Of course, there may be sporadic cases  of it, but that is all. If monogamy be the practice of the men of this  country, why the hundreds of thousands of prostitutes, why divorces for  adultery, why those secret establishments where unhappily married men  indemnify themselves for the appearance of monogamy by an association  which can be ended at will? Whence come the mulattoes and the  half-breeds of all sorts? Who so credulous as to believe the fable of  monogamy?    What has monogamy or polygamy or polyandry to do with this matter? I  assume that it is undeniable that motherhood is woman's most manifest  function. If that be so, how can there be any more immorality in the  exercise of it than in the process of digestion? What can be clearer  than that a woman has the inherent right to bear children if she wish?  And there is nothing in experience or morals which demands one father  for all her children. It should be for her to say whether she will have  one father for all her children or one for each. And if the question be  asked how, under such conditions, the interests of the children would be  safe-guarded, I ask if they are safe-guarded now. The right-minded man  provides as he can for them; as would be the case always; while the  wrong-minded man does not now provide properly for them. Besides, is the  mother not to be considered? Do we not all know of women who in  widowhood take care of their families? Do we not know of women who take  care of their husbands as well as of their children? Women, of course,  should, in any case, be economically free. But at least let them be sex  free; let them decide for themselves whether they will have many or few  or no children. Teach woman to be economically independent, give her the  opportunity for full knowledge of all that pertains to motherhood; make  the motherhood a pure and beautiful manifestation of physical activity  if you will, but without forgetting that it is only simple and natural;  avoiding that hysterical glorification of the function in poetry and the  hiding of it in actual life as if it were an unclean thing. But the  important matter is to understand that a woman has a right to bear a  child if she wish. Nothing is more distinctly pointed out by the  constitution of her body, and therefore it is impossible that there can  be any immorality in the exercise of the function. To put my idea in as  few and as bold words as I can: Motherhood is a right and has no proper  relation to marriage. Marriage is a purely artificial relation, and not  only is it not justified by its results, but distinctly it is  discredited by them. By it a man becomes a vile hypocrite since he  loudly avows a moral standard and a course of conduct which in private  by his acts he denies and puts to scorn; by it a woman becomes a slave,  giving up her rights in her own body; submitting to ravishment, and  becoming the accidental mother to unwished, unwelcome children; by it  children are robbed of their plain right to the best equipment that can  be given them; and which cannot be given them under the prevailing  system. It is only when a woman is free to choose the father of her  child that the child can hope for even a partial payment of the debt  that was due it from its parents from the moment they took the  responsibility of calling it from the nowhere into the here. This  doctrine of the responsibility of the parent to the child is  comparatively new and goes neither with marriage nor with the home. The  old and current notion is that the child is a chattel.    Abraham never offers an apology for making little Isaac carry wood and  then mount the sacrificial pile. Indeed we are asked to marvel at the  heroism of the father. Then we are told that God so loved the world that  he gave his only begotten son.

But  there was more to eat in the kitchen than usual, and the servants often  left things on the table when they went out to take in the milk or to  chat with the gardeners; and if people leave things on tables, they have  only themselves to thank for whatever happens.    There was a young man who wore a fur cap, and who used to call with  fish; and I was more surprised than I care to own when I met him walking  out with cook one Sunday afternoon, for I thought she had a soul above  fish; yet when the servants began to ask this young man to tea in the  kitchen, I thought, of course, it must be all right, but Tinker would do  nothing but growl the whole time the young man was there; so that at  last cook had to lock us up in the butler's pantry till the young man  was gone. _I_ had not growled, but I was locked in too. The world is  full of injustice and ingratitude.    Now one night, when the servants went to bed, Tinker and I lay down in  our baskets under the hall table as usual; but Tinker was dreadfully  restless, which must have been only an accident, because he said himself  he didn't know what was the matter with him; and he would not go to  sleep, but kept walking up and down as if he were going to hide a bone  and couldn't find a good place for it.    \"Do lie down, for goodness' sake, Tinker,\" I said, \"and go to sleep. Any  one can see you have not been brought up in a house where regular hours  are kept.\"    \"I can't go to sleep; I don't know what's the matter with me,\" he said  gloomily.    Well, I tried to go to sleep myself, and I think I must almost have  dropped off, when I heard a scrape-scraping from the butler's pantry. I  wasn't going to bark. It wasn't my business. I have often heard Miss  Daisy's relations say that I was no house-dog. Still, I think Tinker  ought to have barked then, but he didn't: only just pricked his ears and  his tail; and he waited, and the scraping went on.    Then Tinker said to me--\"Don't you make a noise, for your life; I am  going to see what it is;\" and he trotted softly into the butler's  pantry. It was rather dark, but you know we dogs can see as well as cats  in the dark, although they do make such a fuss about it, and declare  that they are the only creatures who can.    There was a man outside the window, and I tapped Tinker with my tail to  show him that he ought to bark, but he never moved. The man had been  scraping and scraping till he had got out one of the window-panes. It  was a very little window-pane, only just big enough for his hand to go  through; and the man took out the window-pane and put his hand through,  making a long arm to get at the fastening of the window; and just as he  was going to undo the hasp, Tinker made a spring on to the window-ledge,  and he caught the man's hand in his mouth, and the man gave a push, and  Tinker fell off the window-ledge, but he took the man's hand with him;  and there was the man's arm dragged through the window-pane, and Tinker  hanging on to his fingers.    The man broke some more panes and tried to get his other hand through,  and if he had he would have done for Tinker, but he could not manage it;  and now I thought \"This is the time to bark,\" and I barked. I barked my  best, I barked nobly, though I am not a house-dog, and I don't think  it's my business.    In less than a minute down came the gardener and the under-gardener: and  Tinker was still holding on, and they took the man, and he was marched  off to prison, and it turned out to be the man in the fur cap. But  though they made fuss enough about Tinker's share in the business, you  may be sure it didn't make me think much more of him.    I should never have had anything to say to him but for one thing. Early  one morning we three dogs--it's all over long ago, and I hope I can be  generous and let bygones be bygones; he is one of _us_ now--went out for  a run in the paddock by the wood, and while Trap and I were trotting up  and down chatting about the weather, that Tinker dog bolted into the  wood, and in less than a minute came out with a rabbit.    I saw at once that he could never get it eaten before Miss Daisy came  out, and I knew that, if he were found with it, his sufferings would be  awful. So I helped him to eat it. I know my duty to a fellow-creature, I  trust. It was a very young rabbit, and tender. Not too much fur. Fur  gets in your throat, and spoils your teeth, besides. We had just  finished it when my mistress came out. Trap would not eat a bit, even to  help Tinker out of his scrape, but _I_ have a kind heart.    Well, after that I thought I might as well consent to be friends with  Tinker, in spite of his low breeding. You see, I had helped him out of a  dreadful scrape, and one always feels kindly to people one has helped.  He has caught several more rabbits since then, and I have always stood  by him on those occasions, and I always mean to. I am not one to turn my  back on a friend, I believe.    So now he has a collar like ours, and I hardly feel degraded at all when  I sit opposite to him at the doll's tea-parties.          Rats!      \"HE has no nose,\" said my master; \"he is a handsome dog, but he has no  nose.\"    This annoyed me very much, for I have a nose--a very long, sharp, black  nose. I wear tan boots and gloves, and my coat is a beautiful shiny  black.    I am a Manchester terrier, and I fulfil the old instructions for such  dogs. I am              _Necked like a drake,_            _Headed like a snake,_            _Tailed like a ratte,_            _And footed like a catte._    And then they said I had no nose.    But Kerry explained to me that my master did not mean to find fault with  the shape of my nose, but that what he wanted to be understood was that  I had no nose for smelling rats. Kerry has, and he is ridiculously vain  of this accomplishment.    \"And you have no nose, you know, old boy,\" said Kerry; \"why, you would  let the rats run all over you and never know it.\"    I turned up my nose--my beautiful, pointed, handsome nose--and walked  away without a word.    A few weeks afterwards my master brought home with him some white rats.  Kerry was out at the time, but my master showed me the rats through the  bars of their cage. He also showed me a boot and a stick. Although I  have no nose, I was clever enough to put two and two together. Did I  mention that there were two rats?    We were not allowed to go in the study, either of us, and my master put  the rats there in their cage on the table.    That night, when everybody had gone to bed, I said to Kerry, \"I may have  no nose, old man, but I smell rats.\"    Kerry sniffed contemptuously.    \"You!\" said he, curling himself round in his basket; \"I don't believe  you could smell an elephant if there were one in the dresser drawer.\"    I kept my temper. \"I am not feeling very well, Kerry,\" I said gently,  \"or I would go and see myself. But I am sure there _are_ rats; I smell  them plainly; they seem to be in the study.\"    \"Go to sleep,\" he said; \"you're dreaming, old man.\"    \"Why don't you go and see?\" I said. \"If I didn't feel so very faint, I  would go myself.\"    Kerry got out of his basket reluctantly. \"I suppose I ought to go, if  you are quite certain,\" he said; and he went.    In less than a minute he returned to the kitchen, trembling all over  with excitement.    \"Chappie!\" he said; \"Chappie!\"    \"Well?\"    \"There _are_ rats,\" he whispered hoarsely; \"there are rats in the  study.\"    \"Did you go in?\" I asked.    \"No, you know we're forbidden to go in, but I smelt them quite plainly.  I can't smell them at all here,\" he said regretfully. \"What a nose you  have got, after all, Chappie!\"    \"What are you going to do, Kerry?\" I asked.    \"Why, nothing,\" he said; \"we mustn't go in the study.\"    \"Oh,\" I said, \"rules weren't made for great occasions like this; it's  your business to kill rats wherever they are.\"    And that misguided wire-haired person went up. He got them out of the  cage, and killed them.    The next morning, when the master came down, he thrashed Kerry within an  inch of his life. He knows I don't touch rats; and, besides, I was so  unwell that nobody could have suspected me. And I explained to Kerry  that, good as my nose is, I couldn't possibly tell by the smell that the  rats were white, and, therefore, sacred. It was not worth while to  mention that I had seen them before.    Kerry looks up to me now as a dog with a nose, and I am much happier  than formerly. But Kerry is not nearly so keen on rats now. I thought  somehow he wouldn't be.          The Tables Turned      WE knew it was a dog, directly the basket was set down in the hall. We  heard it moving about inside. We sniffed all round. We asked it why it  didn't come out (the basket was tightly tied up with string). \"Are you  having a good time in there?\" said Roy. \"Can't you show your face?\" said  I. \"He's ashamed of it,\" said Roy, waving his long bushy tail. Then he  growled a little, and the dog inside growled too; and then, as Roy had  an appointment with the butcher at his own back door, I went out to see  him home.    \"I am so sorry I am going away for Christmas with my master,\" he said  when we parted; \"but you must introduce that new dog to me when I come  home. We mustn't stand any of his impudence, eh?\"    I was sorry Roy was going away, for Roy is my great friend. He always  fights the battles for both of us. I daresay I might have got into the  way of fighting my own battles, but I never like to interfere with  anybody's pleasure, and Roy's chief pleasure is fighting. As for me, I  think the delights of that recreation are over-estimated.    When my master came home, he opened the basket, and a dog of Irish  family tumbled out, growling and snarling, and hid himself under the  sofa. They wasted more biscuits on him than I have ever seen wasted on  any deserving dog; and at last they got him out,"]]]
