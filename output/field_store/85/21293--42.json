It was a warm day of early spring on the Upper Missouri, when the  subtle joy of awakening life stirs the blood and rouses the fancy. The  brown outline of the bare trees was already broken by little leaves  that were shaking themselves in the bright sunlight. Flowers were  peering through the vivid green of the freshly sprung grass, the birds  had come, and the silence of the year had passed. It was a day to  enjoy outdoor life, to indulge in hope and happy thoughts. The sky was  so blue between the rolling white clouds that one forgot they could  ever become portentous of storm. The tents of the Indians, dotted  along the banks of the stream, stood like tall white flowers among the  trees. Women and children were chatting and calling to each other. Men  moved sedately about, busy with preparations for the coming summer  days. Young men and maidens were thinking of each other; for the  morning song of the lover had been heard, and the signal flash of the  mirror[8] had revealed his watching-place to the dark-eyed girl  demurely drawing water for the household in the early dawn.    [Footnote 8: Young men carried small looking-glasses with which they  flashed signals.]    Unheeding the passage of the hours, I wandered up the narrow valley,  noting the fading lines of aboriginal life spread out before me. All  at once I became aware that the brightness of the day was  overshadowed: a greyish hue, that rapidly deepened, pervaded the  scene. Suddenly the wind came over the hills, the birds darted about,  and the sound of thunder was heard. Everything was seeking a shelter;  and, as I turned in haste, hoping to reach the nearest tent, I saw an  old woman emerge from a lodge and in the face of the storm begin to  climb the hill, down which the wind swept, laying low the grass and  whipping the heads of the flowers. Seemingly unmindful of the storm,  on the woman went, her scant garments flapping, and her hair, seamed  with grey, tossing about her wrinkled face. The sight was so strange  that I paused to watch her, as she climbed on and on, steadfastly  breasting the storm. The lightnings flashed around her, and the  thunder echoed among the hills as she reached the top. There she  stopped and stood, a silhouette against the surging clouds, her hands  uplifted, her head thrown back; and between the thunder peals I heard  her voice ring out loud and clear in a song,--a song, I doubted not,  that carried a message to the mighty storm, in which to her the gods  were present. Many years have passed since I witnessed this scene and  learned the story of the woman's song. She is now at rest, and let us  hope her lifelong sorrow may have turned to joy.    In the early part of the century a Dakota woman fasted and prayed, and  Thunder came to her in her vision. To the god she promised to give her  firstborn child. When she became a mother, she forgot in her joy that  the life of her little one did not belong to her; nor did she recall  her fateful vow until one bright spring day, when the clouds gathered  and she heard the roll of the thunder,--a sound which summoned all  persons consecrated to this god to bring their offerings and to pay  their vows. Then she remembered what she had promised; but her heart  forbade her to lay the infant, which was smiling in her arms, upon the  cloud-swept hill-top. She pressed the baby to her breast, and waited  in silence the passing of the god in the storm.    The following spring, when the first thunder pealed, she did not  forget her vow; but she could not gather strength to fulfil it.    Another year passed, and again the thunder sounded. Taking the  toddling child by the hand, the mother climbed the hill; and, when the  top was reached, she placed it on the ground and fled. But the boy  scrambled up and ran after her, and his frightened cry stayed her  feet. He caught her garments and clung to them; and, although the  thunder called, she could not obey. Her vow had been made before she  knew the strength of a mother's love.    Gathering the boy in her arms, she hid herself and him from the  presence of the god. The storm passed, and the mother and child  returned to the lodge; but fear had taken possession of her, and she  watched her son with eyes in which terror and love struggled for the  mastery.    One day, as the little one played beside a rippling brook, laughing  and singing in his glee, suddenly the clouds gathered, the flashing  lightning and the crashing thunder sent beast and bird to cover, and  drove the mother out to find her child. She heard his voice above the  fury of the storm, calling to her. As she neared the brook, a vivid  flash blinded her eyes. For a moment she was stunned; but, recovering,  she pushed on, only to be appalled by the sight that met her gaze.  Her boy lay dead. The thunder god had claimed his own.    No other children came to lighten the sorrow of the lonely woman; and  every spring, when the first thunder sounded, and whenever the storm  swept the land, this stricken woman climbed the hills, and there,  standing alone, facing the black rolling clouds, she sang her song of  sorrow and of fealty.           *       *       *       *       *    The words of the song are addressed to the god; but the music, in its  swaying rhythm, suggests the mother's memory of the days when she  soothed her little child.    The following is a free translation of the Indian words:--         E dho he![9]       Behold! On their mighty pinions flying,       They come, the gods come once more       Sweeping o'er the land,       Sounding their call to me, to me their own.       Wa-gi-u_n_![10] Ye on mighty pinions flying,       Look on me here, me your own,       Thinking on my vow       As ye return once more, Wa-gi-u_n_!    [Footnote 9: Sighing vocables.]    [Footnote 10: Dakota term for the thunder bird.]    [Music: THE MOTHER'S VOW.    _Dakota._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.    E dho he!

The native flageolet has proved a trusty friend to many a youth to  whom nature had denied the power of expressing in vocal melody his  fealty to the maiden of his choice. With its woody tones he rivalled  the birds as he sounded his love-call from the hills and made glad the  heart of the girl, who, catching the signal, awaited his coming at the  spring.    There are many bits of music composed for this little instrument,  which, in spite of its inaccuracies of pitch, arising from imperfect  construction, are not without hints of beauty.    [Music: LOVE CALL.    _Omaha._    For the Flageolet.]          A GAME SONG FROM THE NORTH-WEST COAST.      It is well known that the serious avocations of the fathers often  serve as games for the children. So it comes about that in the games  of chance we have a survival of the ancient custom of divination. As,  according to Indian belief, song was the medium through which man  communicated with the mysterious powers, we find all his games of  chance accompanied by melodies.    One autumn evening many years ago I was walking along a stretch of the  Pacific shore. The westerning moon flooded the water with light, and  lit up the edge of the dense forest that formed the background of an  Indian village. From one of its great square wooden dwellings came the  sound of singing, and the ruddy firelight shone through the cracks of  the plank door as I approached.    Entering, I saw that the central fire had just been lighted. The four  families, which had each their particular portion of the communal  house, had suffered their separate fires to burn to ashes, and had  pushed back their various belongings to give more room for the  gathering crowd.    I lingered at the door, looking on the motley scene: the women and  children in the background; the old men in groups, talking over their  younger days; the line of men singers, each with his piece of board  with which to strike the floor in lieu of a drum; the young men who  were to play, ranged in two opposite rows; and others standing about,  watching their friends and eager for the game to begin.    When all was ready, the leader of one side held up for a moment in one  hand a small piece of bone, then began tossing it secretly from one  hand to the other, moving the closed fists rapidly past each other to  the rhythm of the song sung by the singers, the opposite side keeping  sharp eyes on the moving fists, to be ready, when the signal should be  given, to detect, if possible, the hand to which the bone had finally  been passed.    Heavy stakes were put up, and there was every sign that song after  song would follow each other as the night wore on.    The song which follows is sung when playing a game of chance:--    [Music: GAME SONG.    _Vancouver's Island._    Transcribed and Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.]          STORY AND SONG OF THE INDIAN COQUET.      In the last century there lived a man who, in his young days, was a  desperate coquet. He played havoc with the plans of many a young man,  robbing him of the fancy of his sweetheart, and then leaving the  maiden all forlorn. His behaviour aroused the anger and jealousy of  both sexes, but he seemed as impervious to the contempt of his fellows  as he was callous to the woe of his victims. The whole village buzzed  with the gossip of his adventures, and every one wondered how he  managed to escape punishment.    After the manner of the people, a song was made about him and his  career, that has outlasted his vain victories.    It is difficult to convey in concise English the sarcastic humour of  the original. The words picture this young man as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25172"],[0,"Moral Principles in Education (#6)"],[1,"is, as modes of personal experiencing, before we can get out of them  their moral potentialities.    The psychological side of education sums itself up, of course, in a  consideration of character. It is a commonplace to say that the  development of character is the end of all school work. The difficulty  lies in the execution of the idea. And an underlying difficulty in this  execution is the lack of a clear conception of what character means.  This may seem an extreme statement. If so, the idea may be conveyed by  saying that we generally conceive of character simply in terms of  results; we have no clear conception of it in psychological terms--that  is, as a process, as working or dynamic. We know what character means in  terms of the actions which proceed from it, but we have not a definite  conception of it on its inner side, as a system of working forces.    (1) Force, efficiency in execution, or overt action, is one necessary  constituent of character. In our moral books and lectures we may lay the  stress upon good intentions, etc. But we know practically that the kind  of character we hope to build up through our education is one that not  only has good intentions, but that insists upon carrying them out. Any  other character is wishy-washy; it is goody, not good. The individual  must have the power to stand up and count for something in the actual  conflicts of life. He must have initiative, insistence, persistence,  courage, and industry. He must, in a word, have all that goes under the  name \"_force_ of character.\" Undoubtedly, individuals differ greatly in  their native endowment in this respect. None the less, each has a  certain primary equipment of impulse, of tendency forward, of innate  urgency to do. The problem of education on this side is that of  discovering what this native fund of power is, and then of utilizing it  in such a way (affording conditions which both stimulate and control) as  to organize it into definite conserved modes of action--habits.    (2) But something more is required than sheer force. Sheer force may be  brutal; it may override the interests of others. Even when aiming at  right ends it may go at them in such a way as to violate the rights of  others. More than this, in sheer force there is no guarantee for the  right end. Efficiency may be directed towards mistaken ends and result  in positive mischief and destruction. Power, as already suggested, must  be directed. It must be organized along social channels; it must be  attached to valuable ends.    This involves training on both the intellectual and emotional side. On  the intellectual side we must have judgment--what is ordinarily called  good sense. The difference between mere knowledge, or information, and  judgment is that the former is simply held, not used; judgment is  knowledge directed with reference to the accomplishment of ends. Good  judgment is a sense of respective or proportionate values. The one who  has judgment is the one who has ability to size up a situation. He is  the one who can grasp the scene or situation before him, ignoring what  is irrelevant, or what for the time being is unimportant, who can seize  upon the factors which demand attention, and grade them according to  their respective claims. Mere knowledge of what the right is, in the  abstract, mere intentions of following the right in general, however  praiseworthy in themselves, are never a substitute for this power of  trained judgment. Action is always in the concrete. It is definite and  individualized. Except, therefore, as it is backed and controlled by a  knowledge of the actual concrete factors in the situation in which it  occurs, it must be relatively futile and waste.    (3) But the consciousness of ends must be more than merely intellectual.  We can imagine a person with most excellent judgment, who yet does not  act upon his judgment. There must not only be force to ensure effort in  execution against obstacles, but there must also be a delicate personal  responsiveness,--there must be an emotional reaction. Indeed, good  judgment is impossible without this susceptibility. Unless there is a  prompt and almost instinctive sensitiveness to conditions, to the ends  and interests of others, the intellectual side of judgment will not have  proper material to work upon. Just as the material of knowledge is  supplied through the senses, so the material of ethical knowledge is  supplied by emotional responsiveness. It is difficult to put this  quality into words, but we all know the difference between the character  which is hard and formal, and one which is sympathetic, flexible, and  open. In the abstract the former may be as sincerely devoted to moral  ideas as is the latter, but as a practical matter we prefer to live with  the latter. We count upon it to accomplish more by tact, by instinctive  recognition of the claims of others, by skill in adjusting, than the  former can accomplish by mere attachment to rules.    Here, then, is the moral standard, by which to test the work of the  school upon the side of what it does directly for individuals. (_a_)  Does the school as a system, at present, attach sufficient importance to  the spontaneous instincts and impulses? Does it afford sufficient  opportunity for these to assert themselves and work out their own  results? Can we even say that the school in principle attaches itself,  at present, to the active constructive powers rather than to processes  of absorption and learning? Does not our talk about self-activity  largely render itself meaningless because the self-activity we have in  mind is purely \"intellectual,\" out of relation to those impulses which  work through hand and eye?    Just in so far as the present school methods fail to meet the test of  such questions moral results must be unsatisfactory. We cannot secure  the development of positive force of character unless we are willing to  pay its price. We cannot smother and repress the child's powers, or  gradually abort them (from failure of opportunity for exercise), and  then expect a character with initiative and consecutive industry. I am  aware of the importance attaching to inhibition, but mere inhibition is  valueless. The only restraint, the only holding-in, that is of any worth  is that which comes through holding powers concentrated upon a positive  end. An end cannot be attained excepting as instincts and impulses are  kept from discharging at random and from running off on side tracks. In  keeping powers at work upon their relevant ends, there is sufficient  opportunity for genuine inhibition. To say that inhibition is higher  than power, is like saying that death is more than life, negation more  than affirmation, sacrifice more than service.    (_b_) We must also test our school work by finding whether it affords  the conditions necessary for the formation of good judgment. Judgment as  the sense of relative values involves ability to select, to  discriminate. Acquiring information can never develop the power of  judgment. Development of judgment is in spite of, not because of,  methods of instruction that emphasize simple learning. The test comes  only when the information acquired has to be put to use. Will it do what  we expect of it? I have heard an educator of large experience say that  in her judgment the greatest defect of instruction to-day, on the  intellectual side, is found in the fact that children leave school  without a mental perspective. Facts seem to them all of the same  importance. There is no foreground or background. There is no  instinctive habit of sorting out facts upon a scale of worth and of  grading them.    The child cannot get power of judgment excepting as he is continually  exercised in forming and testing judgments. He must have an opportunity  to select for himself, and to attempt to put his selections into  execution, that he may submit them to the final test, that of action.  Only thus can he learn to discriminate that which promises success from  that which promises failure; only thus can he form the habit of relating  his purposes and notions to the conditions that determine their value.  Does the school, as a system, afford at present sufficient opportunity  for this sort of experimentation? Except so far as the emphasis of the  school work is upon intelligent doing, upon active investigation, it  does not furnish the conditions necessary for that exercise of judgment  which is an integral factor in good character.    (_c_) I shall be brief with respect to the other point, the need of  susceptibility and responsiveness. The informally social side of  education, the aesthetic environment and influences, are all-important.  In so far as the work is laid out in regular and formulated ways, so far  as there are lacking opportunities for casual and free social  intercourse between pupils and between the pupils and the teacher, this  side of the child's nature is either starved, or else left to find  haphazard expression along more or less secret channels. When the school  system, under plea of the practical (meaning by the practical the  narrowly utilitarian), confines the child to the three R's and the  formal studies connected with them, shuts him out from the vital in  literature and history, and deprives him of his right to contact with  what is best in architecture, music, sculpture, and picture, it is  hopeless to expect definite results in the training of sympathetic  openness and responsiveness.           *       *       *       *       *    What we need in education is a genuine faith in the existence of moral  principles which are capable of effective application. We believe, so  far as the mass of children are concerned, that if we keep at them long  enough we can teach reading and writing and figuring. We are  practically, even if unconsciously, skeptical as to the possibility of  anything like the same assurance in morals. We believe in moral laws "]]]
