[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#6)"],[1,"a  very large number of middle-class young men able and anxious to marry,  who lack feminine acquaintances of their own social standing from whom  to make a choice. Unfortunate _mesalliances_ are often the result, and  it seems to me a sad and wasteful thing that these uxoriously-inclined  men cannot be brought into contact with some of the thousands of young  women whose lives are passed in uncongenial toil and who are eating out  their hearts in their anxiety for a home and a husband of their own.  Until the I.F.E.M. becomes fact, here is splendid work ready to hand for  a philanthropist of infinite tact, and large, sympathetic heart. What a  chance to add to the sum of human joy! What a rich reward for the  expenditure of but a little time and money!            IV      THE TRAGEDY OF THE UNDESIRED      'So man and woman will keep their trust,    Till the very Springs of the Sea run dust.      'Yea, each with the other will lose and win,    For the Strife of Love's the abysmal Strife,    And the Word of Love is the Word of Life.      'And they that go with the Word unsaid,    Though they seem of the living, are damned and dead.'        --W. E. HENLEY.      This is a tragedy of which few men know the existence and certainly no  man in these woman-ridden isles can ever have experienced. Men always  treat with derision the woman anxious for matrimony, and gibe equally at  the spinster who fails to attain it. Heaven alone knows why, since by  men's laws and traditions the married state has been made to mean  everything desirable for a woman, and the unmarried condition everything  undesirable. 'People think women who do not want to marry unfeminine;  people think women who do want to marry immodest; people combine both  opinions by regarding it as unfeminine for women not to look longingly  forward to wifehood as the hope and purpose of their lives, and  ridiculing and contemning any individual woman of their acquaintance  whom they suspect of entertaining such a longing. They must wish and  not wish; they must not give, and certainly must not withhold,  encouragement--and so it goes on, each precept cancelling the last,  and most of them negative.'[1]        [Footnote 1: Augusta Webster.]    Both Mr Bernard Shaw and Mr George Moore have stated in print that women  frequently propose to men, and several men have confided in me details  of the proposals they have received from forward fair ones. I believe it  is one of the tenets of advanced women that the sex that bears the child  has a right to choose the husband. Although unpleasantly revolutionary  this seems eminently sane. That the right to choose a mate should be  open to all adults, instead of being the sole privilege of the most  selfish and least observant sex, will possibly be acknowledged in the  future, when the woman question shall be set at rest for ever.    In those far-off days there will, let us hope, be no more tragedy of  the undesired. It seems almost indelicate to apply this phrase to the  noble army of British spinsters, for the most part dignified, worthy  women, comprising ratepayers, householders, philanthropists,  mothers-in-all-but-fact--working parochially, among the poor, in  hospitals, schools, homes, offices, and studios--on public bodies,  on the staff of newspapers--generally cheerful and helpful, sometimes  clever, often charming, occasionally a little narrow perhaps, but on the  whole upholding the best traditions of their sex, and of course _never_  admitting that they would like to have married. Deep in their own  hearts, however, almost all of them must feel the sadness of their  unfulfilment, comfort themselves how they may with other interests.  Those that have engrossing occupations should be thankful, for the woman  whose whole heart is set on finding a husband and who fails to attain  this object generally becomes fretful, bitter, disappointed and useless  in every way. But women whose minds are sufficiently broad to hold other  ideals than the matrimonial one find other work to do, and do it capably  and faithfully. Loving and sympathetic women are always wanted. Marriage  is not essential to such a woman's life, though it may be to the highest  development of her happiness.    Again, the large number of women who have had chances of marrying can  comfort themselves that they chose to be single for their ideal's  sake--or for whatever the reason was. Larger still is the number of  those possessing the non-marrying temperament of which Bernard Shaw has  written: 'Barren--the Life-Force passes it by.' This rarely troubles  them; they have a host of minor pleasures and interests which suffice;  no storms of feeling, no pangs of stifled mother-longing ruffle the  placid surface of their lives. The real tragedy of the undesired does  not touch either of these classes; it is reserved in all its poignancy  for those who belong to the type of the _grande amoureuse_, whom lack of  opportunity generally, lack of attractiveness sometimes, has prevented  from fulfilling the deepest need of their nature.    I once met at a hotel on the Riviera an elderly spinster who was always  incredibly depressed. However bravely shone the sun, however fair seemed  the world in that fairest spot, nothing had the power to cheer her.  I tried once to get her to join in an excursion which a party of us were  going to make on donkey-back to a neighbouring village in the hills, but  she refused. Another time I invited her to accompany me to the rooms at  Monte Carlo, but she again refused, and after several well-meant efforts  on my part to cheer her had led to the same result, the poor soul told  me in hesitating words that she shunned gay places and lively  gatherings. 'They always make me discontented and remind me of what I  might have had; it brings home to me the--what shall I call it?--the  _tragedy of the might-have-been_.' I understood what she meant, and no  further words on the subject passed between us, much to my relief, as  confidences of this nature are very painful to both sides. My readers  will probably despise this poor lady as morbid, selfish and unbalanced.  Possibly they are right, but the sadness of an empty heart, a lonely  life, was the cause of her warped nature. Fortunately hers is an extreme  case; the majority of spinsters I imagine can take a delight in seeing  girls happy, and are generally deeply interested in the love affairs of  others. I recall a beautiful line of Fiona Macleod's to the effect that  'a secret vision in the soul will hallow life.' This will suffice to  keep many spinsters happy--the memory of some love and tenderness,  a romance of some kind to sweeten life; women need it.    To give another instance: a woman once asked me why men fell in love.  'I wonder if you can tell me what it is about women that makes men  propose to them,' she said. 'I've known numbers of plain women married  and numbers of penniless ones, and some quite horrid ones without a  single quality likely to make a man happy, yet there must have been  _something_ about them that attracted--some reason for it.'    She went on to tell me in such a pathetic way how she longed to have a  home and a 'nice, kind man,' to care for her, and yet no man had ever  asked her; no man had ever desired her or looked on her with love; she  had never known the clasp of a man's passionate arms, nor the ecstasy of  a lover's kiss. It seemed very strange to me, strangely painful and  horribly humiliating. I could scarcely bear to look at her while she  told me these things.    'I would make a man so happy,' she said, and her mournful dark eyes  filled with tears; she had rather fine eyes, and was quite a  nice-looking woman with a most sweet and gentle manner. 'I would be so  good to him,' she went on; 'I'd simply live for him. I try to put it out  of my mind, but as I grow older, and it's more hopeless, I think of it  more and more and sometimes I feel I shall go mad with the misery of it.  The future is so utterly grey and it's all so unjust. I'm so fitted for  love, and now my life's going and I've had nothing, _nothing_!'    She wept bitterly and I wept too in sympathy with her. Curiously enough,  this woman was not only attractive, as I have said, and anxious to  please, and thoroughly feminine, but she had had ample opportunities of  meeting men. I suppose she lacked what the Scotch peasant-woman called  the '_come hither in the 'ee_'--some subtle sex-magnetism which had been  possessed by those 'plain, penniless, and horrid women' whom she talked  about. Or perhaps it was that the 'will to live' was absent and  therefore no mate came to the woman.    There are thousands of women who feel the same, though in most cases  they would scorn to own it. We hear a good deal of man's right to live;  what about woman's right to love? Women are so constituted that the need  for loving and being loved is the strongest factor of their being, the  essential of their existence. All over the country there are lonely  women of every class, leisured and working women, pretty and plain, good  and bad, who are hungering and thirsting for love, for a man to take  care of them, for the right to wifehood and the thrice blessed right to  motherhood. In the Press the parrot cry of men echoes ceaselessly:  'Women shouldn't meddle in politics; women shouldn't do this or  that--let them mind their homes and their children.' But the restless  women who do these things have generally no homes or children to mind;  what is the use of preaching the sacredness of motherhood when you will  not allow them to be mothers? To what end prate of the duties of  wifehood when you do not ask them to be wives?    It is a well-known physiological fact that numbers of women become  insane in middle life who would not have done so if they had enjoyed the  ordinary duties, pleasures and preoccupations of matrimony--if their  women's natures had not been starved by an unnatural celibacy."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31534"],[0,"Fifty-Two Sunday Dinners: A Book of Recipes (#6)"],[1,"and  turnip cut in straws and parboiled in boiling, salted water ten minutes,  and set in oven to complete cooking.

Beat egg slightly and dilute  with one-half cup cold water, add to coffee and mix thoroughly. Turn  into coffeepot and add boiling water, stir well. Place on range; let  boil five minutes. If not boiled sufficiently, coffee will not be clear;  if boiled too long, the tannic acid will be extracted, causing serious  gastric trouble. Stuff the spout of pot with soft paper to prevent the  escape of aroma. Stir down, pour off one cup to clear the spout of  grounds, return to pot. Add remaining half-cup cold water to complete  the clearing process. Place pot on back of range for ten minutes, where  coffee will not boil. Serve immediately. If coffee must be kept longer,  drain from the grounds and keep just below boiling point.          _February_              _Variety's the very spice of life,             That gives it all its flavor._                                --_Cowper._    [Illustration]    [Sidenote: _February_    _First Sunday_]          Menu              GRAPE-FRUIT COCKTAILS              TOMATO BOUILLON              LAKE TROUT BAKED IN PAPER BAG              SAUCE A L'ITALIENNE              FRENCH FRIED POTATOES      BRUSSELS SPROUTS              FRENCH ENDIVE--FRENCH DRESSING              EGGLESS RICE PUDDING--HARD SAUCE              COFFEE           *       *       *       *       *    GRAPE-FRUIT COCKTAIL    Select heavy grape-fruit (weight means more pulp than rind).
