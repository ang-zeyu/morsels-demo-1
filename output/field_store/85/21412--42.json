I studied the wreck. It was battered and tilted on its beam ends, but  I could still make out the high poop that marked it as a very old  ship.    \"A Spanish galleon, Mercer,\" I conjectured.    \"I believe so.\" And then, in pictured form, for Imee's benefit, \"It  has been here while much time passed?\"    \"Yes.\" Imee came darting back to us, smiling. \"Since before the  Teemorn, my people were here. A Rorn we made prisoner once told us his  people discovered it first. They went into this strange skeleton, and  inside were many blocks of very bright stone.\" She pictured quite  clearly bars of dully-glinting bullion. Evidently the captive had told  his story well.           *       *       *       *       *    \"These stones, which were so bright, the Rorn took to their city,  which is three swims distant.\" How far that might be, I could not even  guess. A swim, it seemed, was the distance a Teemorn could travel  before the need for rest became imperative. \"There were many Rorn, and  they each took one stone. And of them, they made a house for their  leader.\" The leader, as she pictured him, being the most hideous  travesty of a thing in semi-human form that the mind could imagine:  incredibly old and wrinkled and ugly and gray, his noseless face  seamed with cunning, his eyes red rimmed and terrible, his teeth  gleaming, white and sharp, like fangs.    \"A whole house, except the roof,\" she went on. \"It is there now, and  it is gazed at with much admiration by all the Rorn. All this our  prisoner told us before we took him, with a rock made fast to him, out  over the Place of Darkness. He, too, was very proud of their leader's  house.\"    \"Treasure!\" I commented to Mercer. \"If we could find the city of the  Rorn, we might make the trip pay for itself!\"    I could sense his wave of amusement.    \"I think,\" he replied, \"I'd rather stand it myself. These Rorn don't  appeal to me.\"    It was over half an hour before we were at last free of our diving  suits.    The first thing Captain Bonnett said:    \"We've got to get to the surface, and that quickly. Our air supply is  running damnably low. By the time we blow out the tanks we'll be just  about out. And foul air will keep us here until we rot. I'm sorry,  sir, but that's the way matters stand.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mercer, white-faced and ill, stared at him dazedly.    \"Air?\" he repeated groggily--I knew just how he felt--\"We should have  lots of air. The specifications--\"    \"But we're dealing with facts, not specifications, sir,\" said Captain  Bonnett. \"Another two hours here and we won't leave ever.\"    \"Then it can't be helped, Captain,\" muttered Mercer. \"We'll go up. And  back. For more compressed air. We must remember to plot our course  exactly. You kept the record on the way out as I instructed you?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Captain Bonnett.    \"Just a minute, then,\" said Mercer.    Weakly he made his way forward to the little cubbyhole in which was  housed the central station of his thought-telegraph. I didn't even  inspect the gleaming maze of apparatus. I merely watched him dully as  he plugged in an antenna similar to the one we had left with Imee, and  adjusted the things on his head.           *       *       *       *       *    His eyes brightened instantly. \"She's still wearing her antenna,\" he  said swiftly over his shoulder. \"I'll tell her that something's  happened; we must leave, but that we will return.\"    He sat there, frowning intently for a moment, and then dragged the  antenna wearily from his head. He touched a switch somewhere, and  several softly glowing bulbs turned slowly red and then dark.    \"You and I,\" he groaned, \"had better go to bed. We overdid it. She  understands, I think. Terribly sorry, terribly disappointed. Some  sort of celebration planned, I gather. Captain Bonnett!\"    \"Yes, sir?\"    \"You may proceed now as you think best,\" said Mercer. \"We're retiring.  Be sure and chart the course back, so we may locate this spot again.\"    \"Yes, sir!\" said Captain Bonnett.           *       *       *       *       *    When I awoke we were at anchor, our deck barely awash, before the  deserted beach of Mercer's estate. Still feeling none too well, Mercer  and I made our way to the narrow deck.    Captain Bonnett was waiting for us, spruce in his blue uniform, his  shoulders bowed as always.    \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" he offered, smiling crisply. \"The open air  seems good, doesn't it?\"    It did. There was a fresh breeze blowing in from the Atlantic, and I  filled my lungs gratefully. I had not realized until that instant just  how foul the air below had been.    \"Very fine, Captain,\" said Mercer, nodding. \"You have signaled the men  on shore to send out a boat to take us off?\"    \"Yes, sir; I believe they're launching her now.\"    \"And the chart of our course--did the return trip check with the  other?\"    \"Perfectly, sir.\" Captain Bonnett reached in an inner pocket of his  double-breasted coat, extracted two folded pages, and extended them,  with a little bow, to Mercer.    Just as Mercer's eager fingers touched the precious papers, however,  the wind whisked them from Bonnett's grasp and whirled them into the  water.    Bonnett gasped and gazed after them for a split second; then, barely  pausing to tear off his coat, he plunged over the side.           *       *       *       *       *    He tried desperately, but before he could reach either one of the  tossing white specks, they were washed beneath the surface and  disappeared. Ten minutes later, his uniform bedraggled and shapeless,  he pulled himself on deck.    \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he gasped, out of breath. \"Sorrier than I can say. I  tried--\"    Mercer, white-faced and struggling with his emotions, looked down and  turned away.    \"You don't remember the bearings, I suppose?\" he ventured tonelessly.    \"I'm sorry--no.\"    \"Thank you, Captain, for trying so hard to recover the papers,\" said  Mercer. \"You'd better change at once; the wind is sharp.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The captain bowed and disappeared down the conning tower. Then Mercer  turned to me, and a smile struggled for life.    \"Well, Taylor, we helped her out, anyway,\" he said slowly. \"I'm sorry  that--that Imee will misunderstand when we don't come back.\"    \"But, Mercer,\" I said swiftly, \"perhaps we'll be able to find our way  back to her. You thought before, you know, that--\"    \"But I can see now what an utterly wild-goose chase it would have  been.\" Mercer shook his head slowly. \"No, old friend, it would be  impossible. And--Imee will not come again to guide us; she will think  we have deserted her. And\"--he smiled slowly up into my eyes--\"perhaps  it is as well. After all, the photographs and the data I wanted would  do the world no practical good. We did Imee and her people a good  turn; let's content ourselves with that. I, for one, am satisfied.\"    \"And I, old timer,\" I said, placing my hand affectionately upon his  shoulder. \"Here's the boat. Shall we go ashore?\"    We did go ashore, silently. And as we got out of the boat, and set  foot again upon the sand, we both turned and looked out across the  smiling Atlantic, dancing brightly in the sun.

Seven Secret Service men had completely  disappeared. Another had been found a screaming, homicidal maniac,  whose fingers writhed like snakes. So Bell, of the secret \"Trade,\"  plunges into South America after The Master--the mighty, unknown  octopus of power whose diabolical poison threatens a continent!]      CHAPTER I    The engines of the _Almirante Gomez_ were going dead slow. Away up  beside her monster funnels her siren blew dismally, _Whoo-oo-oo-oo!_  and was silent for the regulation period, and blew desolately again  into the clinging gray mist that ringed her all about.    Her decks were wet and glistening. Droplets of water stood upon the  deck-stanchions, and dripped from the outer edge of the roof above the  promenade deck. A thin, swirling fog lay soggily upon the water and  the big steamer went dead slow upon her course, sending dismal and  depressing blasts from her horn from time to time. It was barely  possible to see from one side of the ship to the other. It was surely  impossible to see the bow from a point half astern.    Charley Bell went forward along the promenade deck. He passed Senor  Ortiz, ex-Minister of the Interior of the Argentine Republic. Ortiz  bowed to him punctiliously, but Bell had a sudden impression that the  Argentine's face was gray and ghastly. He checked himself and looked  back. The little man was climbing the companion-ladder toward the  wireless room.           *       *       *       *       *    Bell slipped on toward the bow. He did not want to give an impression  of furtiveness, but the _Almirante Gomez_ was twelve days out of New  York and Bell was still entirely ignorant of why he was on board. He  had been called into the office of his chief in the State Department  and told curtly that his request for leave of absence had been  granted. And Bell had not asked for a leave of absence. But at just  that moment he saw a rubber band on the desk of his immediate  superior, a fairly thick rubber band which had been tied into a  certain intricate knot. And Bell had kept quiet. He went to his  apartment, found his bags packed and tickets to Rio via the _Almirante  Gomez_ in an envelope on his dressing-table, and went out and caught a  train to the ship.

The siren up above"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#6)"],[1,"they nevertheless become the prey of  the band who rush on to the quarry. In Asia wild dogs do not fear even  to attack the tiger. Many no doubt are crushed by a blow of the  animal's paw or strangled in his jaws, but the death of comrades does  not destroy either the courage or the greediness of the surviving  aggressors. Their number also is such that the great beast, covered by  agile enemies who cling to him and wound him in every part, must at  last succumb.    Wolves hunt also in considerable bands. Their audacity, especially  when pressed by hunger in the bad season, is well known. In time of  war they follow armies, to attack stragglers and to devour the dead.  In Siberia they pursue sledges on the snow with terrible perseverance,  and the pack is not delayed by the massacre of those who are shot. A  few stop to devour at once their fallen comrades, while the others  continue the pursuit.    Besides these brutal chases wolves seem able to exercise a genuine  feint. Sometimes it is a couple who hunt in concert. If they meet a  flock, as they are well aware that the dog will bravely defend the  animals entrusted to him, that he is vigilant, and that his keen scent  will bring him on them much sooner than the shepherd, it is with him  that they first occupy themselves. The two wolves approach secretly;  then suddenly one of them unmasks and attracts the attention of the  dog, who rushes after him with such ardour that he fails to perceive  that in the meantime the second thief has seized the sheep and dragged  it into the wood. The dog finally renounces his pursuit of the  fugitive and returns to his flock. Then the two confederates join each  other and share the prey. In other circumstances it is a wolf who  hunts with his female. When they wish to obtain possession of a deer,  whose robust flight may last a long time, one of the couple, the male  for example, pursues him and directs his chase in such a way that the  game must pass by a place where the female wolf is concealed. She then  takes up the chase while the male reposes. It is an organised system  of relays. The strength of the deer becomes necessarily exhausted; he  cannot resist the animation shown by his active foe, and is seized and  killed. Then the other wolf calmly approaches the place of the feast  to share his part of the booty.    The small but bold Hawk called the Merlin also courses in relays in  exactly the same manner. These birds pursue a Lark or a Swallow in the  most systematic manner. First one Merlin chases the bird for a short  time, while his companion hovers quietly at hand; then the latter  relieves his fellow-hunter, who rests in his turn. The victim is soon  tired out and caught in mid-air by one of the Merlins, who flies away  with him, leaving his companion to hunt alone, while he feeds the  young brood.[18]       [18] C. St. John, _Wild Sports and Natural History of the          Highlands_, chap. xi.    The Fox also successfully uses this method of coursing with relays.  There are indeed few animals who possess so many tricks of all kinds  to gain possession of their prey. Constantly prowling about the  fields, he neglects no propitious circumstance, and profits by all the  advantages furnished by the situation of places or the habits of the  game he is seeking. He pursues tired or wounded animals whom he meets,  and easily masters them. If he finds a burrow, he quickly hollows a  hole and brings to light the young rabbits who thought themselves in  safety in the bowels of the earth; he robs nests placed in the  thickets, and devours the young birds. Beehives are not protected  against his greediness by the stings of the swarms; he rolls on the  earth, crushes his assailants, and finally triumphs over the  discouraged insects and gorges himself with honey.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    Birds of prey also invent ingenious combinations to reach a good  flier. Most of the great rapacious birds of rapid flight or with  powerful talons are so well organised for the chase that they have no  need of cunning. To see the prey, to seize it and devour it, are acts  accomplished in a moment by the single fact of their natural  organisation. It is rather among those who are less well endowed that  one finds real art and frequent ruses. The Goshawk (_Astur  palumbarius_, Fig. 3) is sufficiently strong and flies sufficiently  well to seize small birds; but in order to obtain a copious repast at  one snatch he prefers to attack pigeons. Generally the strength of  their wings promptly places them in safety. He therefore hides himself  in the neighbourhood of the pigeon-house, ready to fall on those  pigeons who pick up food around. But the pigeons are suspicious, and  if they recognise his presence they remain hidden in their dwellings.  In this case it has sometimes been found that the Goshawk has quietly  flown up to their house and alighted on its summit; there, by  violently beating his wings, he gives a succession of sudden blows to  the roof. Startled and frightened by this unaccustomed noise, the  inhabitants dart out, and the bird of prey can then profit by their  alarm to seize one or two.[19]       [19] Wodzicki, \"Ornithologische Miscell.,\" _Journ. f.          Ornithol._, 1856.    The _Pseudaetus_ is also obliged to have recourse to a subterfuge in  order to gain birds that fly well. He easily destroys fowls, and hunts  them so successfully that in Spain, in certain isolated farms, it has  been necessary to give up rearing fowls in consequence of these  numerous depredations. But to seize pigeons is not so easy a matter.  Generally, according to Jerdon, two birds unite to attack a band. One  of the aggressors pretends to wish to seize them from below. This is a  very unusual method, for birds of prey always rise above the game in  order to throw themselves down on it. This puts out the pigeons, and  they fear the manoeuvre all the more because they are unaccustomed to  it. During this instant of confusion the second assailant passes  unperceived above them, plunges into the midst and seizes a pigeon;  there is a new panic, by which the first aggressor profits in order to  rise rapidly in his turn and seize a second victim.    _Struggles that terminate the hunt._--It is not always sufficient for  the hunter to find game and to reach it. If the game is of large size  it may be able to hold its own, and the pursuit may end in a violent  struggle, in which both skill and cunning are necessary to obtain  conquest.    The Bald Eagle of North America (_Haliaeetus leucocephalus_) hides  himself on a rock by the edge of a stream and awaits the passing of a  swan. This eagle is brave and strong, but the palmiped is vigorous,  and though inferior in the air, he has an advantage on the water, and  may escape death by plunging. The eagle knows this advantage, so he  compels the swan to remain in the air by attacking him from below and  repeatedly striking his belly. Weakened by the flow of blood, and  obliged to fly, not being able to reach the water without finding the  sharp beak which strikes him, the swan succumbs in this unequal  combat, which has been vividly described by Audubon.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    The bird who displays the most remarkable qualities in this struggle  which terminates the chase, exhibiting indeed a real fencing match, is  the Secretary Bird (_Gypogeranus reptilivorus_. Fig. 4.) He is the  more interested in striking without being himself struck since the  fangs with which his prey, the snake, is generally armed might at the  first blow give him a mortal wound. In South Africa he pursues every  snake, even the most venomous. Warned by instinct of the terrible  enemy he has met, the reptile at first seeks safety in flight; the  Secretary follows him on foot, and the ardour of the chase does not  prevent him from being constantly on guard. This is because the snake,  finding himself nearly overtaken, suddenly turns round, ready to use  his defensive weapons. The bird stops, and turns in one of his wings  to protect the lower parts of his body. A real duel then begins. The  snake throws himself on his enemy, who at each stroke parries with the  end of his wing; the fangs are buried in the great feathers which  terminate it, and there leave their poison without producing any  effect. All this time with the other wing the Secretary repeatedly  strikes the reptile, who is at last stunned, and rolls over on the  earth. The conqueror rapidly thrusts his beak into his skull, throws  his victim into the air, and swallows him.[20]       [20] The combat was minutely described by Le Vaillant          (_Hist. Nat. des Oiseaux d'Afrique_, Paris, 1798, t. i. p.          177), whose account has been confirmed by many subsequent          observers.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    _Hunting with projectiles._--It has often been repeated that Man is  the only creature sufficiently intelligent to utilise as weapons  exterior objects like a stone or a stick; in a much greater degree,  therefore, it was said, was he the only creature capable of striking  from afar with a projectile. Nevertheless creatures so inferior as  fish exhibit extreme skill in the art of reaching their prey at a  distance. Several act in this way. There is first the _Toxotes  jaculator_, who lives in the rivers of India. His principal food is  formed by the insects who wander over the leaves of aquatic plants. To  wait until they fell into the water would naturally result in but  meagre fare. To leap at them with one bound is difficult, not to  mention that the noise would cause them to flee. The _Toxotes_ knows a  better trick than that. He draws in some drops of water, and,  contracting his mouth, projects them with so much force and certainty  that they rarely fail to reach the chosen aim, and to bring into the  water all the insects he desires.[21] (Fig. 5.)
