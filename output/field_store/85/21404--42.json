[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#6)"],[1,"   This key is largely based upon Cooke's analytical key. Its use will help  to locate the plant in hand in the genus to which it belongs.    The first thing the student should do is to determine the color of the  spore if it is not evident. This is best done according to the plan  described on page 15.    The plant should be fresh and mature. Careful attention should be given  to different stages of development. The habit of the plant should be  considered; then, as soon as the color of the spores is determined, it  will be an easy matter to locate the genus by means of the key.

The species bearing the white spores seem to be higher in type than  those producing colored spores. Most of the former are firmer, while the  black spored specimens soon deliquesce. The white spores are usually  oval, sometimes round, and in many cases quite spiny. All white-spored  specimens will be found in clean places.      _Amanita. Pers._    _Amanita_ is supposed to be derived from Mount Amanus, an ancient name  of a range separating Cilicia from Syria. It is supposed that Galen  first brought specimens of this fungus from that region.    The genus _Amanita_ has both a volva and veil. The spores are white and  the stem is readily separable from the cap. The volva is universal at  first, enveloping the young plant, yet distinct and free from the  cuticle of the pileus.    This genus contains some of the most deadly poisonous mushrooms,  although a few are known to be very good. There is a large number of  species--about 75 being known, 42 of which have been found in this  country--a few being quite common in this state. All the Amanita are  terrestrial plants, mostly solitary in their habits, and chiefly found  in the woods, or in well wooded grounds.    In the button stage it resembles a small egg or puff-ball, as will be  seen in Figure 6, page 11, and great care should be taken to distinguish  it from the latter, if one is hunting puff-balls to eat; yet the danger  is not great, since the volva usually breaks before the plant comes  through the ground.      _Amanita phalloides. Fr._    THE DEADLY AMANITA.    [Illustration: Figure 11.--Amanita phalloides. Fr. Showing volva at the  base, cap dark.]    [Illustration: Figure 12.--Amanita phalloides. Fr. White form showing  volva, scaly stem, ring.]    _Phalloides_ means phallus-like. This plant and its related species are  deadly poisonous. For this reason the plant should be carefully studied  and thoroughly known by every mushroom hunter. In different localities,  and sometimes in the same locality, the plant will appear in very  different shades of color. There are also variations in the way in which  the volva is ruptured, as well as in the character of the stem.    The beginner will imagine he has a new species often, till he becomes  thoroughly acquainted with all the idiosyncrasies of this plant.    The pileus is smooth, even, viscid when young and moist, frequently  adorned with a few fragments of the volva, white, grayish white,  sometimes smoky-brown; whether the pileus be white, oyster-color or  smoky-brown, the center of the cap will be several shades darker than  the margin.

Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic  GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the  next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-  currency-denominated GDP changed.    GDP (purchasing power parity):  This entry gives the gross domestic  product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within  a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity  (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services  produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United  States. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-  capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources  across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar  value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country  regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent  in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US  military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are  based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In  addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World  Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP  estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing  countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official  exchange rate (OER) measure. The difference between the OER- and PPP-  denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries  are generally much smaller.    GDP - composition by sector:  This entry gives the percentage  contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP. The  distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are  incomplete.    GDP - per capita (PPP):  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power  parity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate:  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis  adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.    GDP methodology:  In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for  countries are reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a  purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Both measures contain information  that is useful to the reader. The PPP method involves the use of  standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to  the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.  The data derived from the PPP method probably provide the best  available starting point for comparisons of economic strength and well-  being between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange rate method  involves a variety of international and domestic financial forces that  may not capture the value of domestic output. Whereas PPP estimates for  OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing  countries are often rough approximations. In developing countries with  weak currencies, the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is  typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Most of the GDP  estimates for developing countries are based on extrapolation of PPP  numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP)  and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of  Pennsylvania and their colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method  should be used for the purpose of calculating the share of items such  as exports, imports, military expenditures, external debt, or the  current account balance, because the dollar values presented in the  Factbook for these items have been converted at official exchange  rates, not at PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the  proportion of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that  share will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.  Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a currency  is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP GDP, the  official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa. However,  there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange rates move  in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in the short- or  medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data should  not be chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because  of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by  statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information,  and changes in national statistical methods and practices.    GNP:  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic  production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather  than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad  may be important to national well-being.    GWP:  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value  of all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Geographic coordinates:  This entry includes rounded latitude and  longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic  center of an entity and is based on the locations provided in the  Geographic Names Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-  Intelligence Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.    Geographic names:  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-  Reference List of Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various  alternate names, former names, local names, and regional names  referenced to one or more related Factbook entries. Spellings are  normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN). Alternate names and additional information are included in  parentheses.    Geography:  This category includes the entries dealing with the natural  environment and the effects of human activity.    Geography - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous geographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Gini index:  See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index    Government:  This category includes the entries dealing with the system  for the adoption and administration of public policy.    Government - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous government  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Government type:  This entry gives the basic form of government.  Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that  for some countries more than one definition applies.):    Absolute monarchy - a form of government where the monarch rules  unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally organized  opposition.    Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought  about by the absence of governmental authority.    Authoritarian - a form of government in which state authority is  imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.    Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.    Communist - a system of government in which the state plans and  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds  power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private  ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward  a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the  people (i.e., a classless society).    Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority  over all matters except those delegated to the central government.    Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws  and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of  that government.    Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the sovereign  power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution.    Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch is  guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.    Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained  by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a  system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed.    Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in the  body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives  responsible to them.    Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).    Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.    Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which  the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim  state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.    Federal (Federation) - a form of government in which sovereign power is  formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of  its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central  government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as  upon the regional units.    Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central  government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,"]]]
