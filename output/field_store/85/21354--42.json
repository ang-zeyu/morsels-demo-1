[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#6)"],[1,"he seemed to drive away some dominant idea, but soon the idea, stronger  than his will, plunged him again into a reverie, a state which struck  everyone the more particularly because it was far from his usual temper.  As to the chevalier, his eyes were fixed constantly upon his  sister-in-law, but in this there was not, as in his brother's behaviour,  anything surprising, since the marquise had never looked so beautiful.    The meal over, the company took leave. The abbe escorted the ladies  downstairs; the chevalier remained with the marquise; but hardly had the  abbe left the room when Madame de Ganges saw the chevalier turn pale and  drop in a sitting position--he had been standing on the foot of the bed.  The marquise, uneasy, asked what was the matter; but before he could  reply, her attention was called to another quarter. The abbe, as pale  and as disturbed as the chevalier, came back into the room, carrying in  his hands a glass and a pistol, and double-locked the door behind him.  Terrified at this spectacle, the marquise half raised herself in her  bed, gazing voiceless and wordless. Then the abbe approached her, his  lips trembling; his hair bristling and his eyes blazing, and, presenting  to her the glass and the pistol, \"Madame,\" said he, after a moment of  terrible silence, \"choose, whether poison, fire, or\"--he made a sign to  the chevalier, who drew his sword--\"or steel.\"    The marquise had one moment's hope: at the motion which she saw the  chevalier make she thought he was coming to her assistance; but being  soon undeceived, and finding herself between two men, both threatening  her, she slipped from her bed and fell on her knees.    \"What have I done,\" she cried, \"oh, my God? that you should thus decree  my death, and after having made yourselves judges should make yourselves  executioners? I am guilty of no fault towards you except of having been  too faithful in my duty to my husband, who is your brother.\"    Then seeing that it was vain to continue imploring the abbe, whose looks  and gestures spoke a mind made up, she turned towards the chevalier.    \"And you too, brother,\" said she, \"oh, God, God! you, too! Oh, have pity  on me, in the name of Heaven!\"    But he, stamping his foot and pressing the point of his sword to her  bosom, answered--    \"Enough, madam, enough; take your choice without delay; for if you do  not take it, we will take it for you.\"    The marquise turned once again to the abbe, and her forehead struck the  muzzle of the pistol. Then she saw that she must die indeed, and  choosing of the three forms of death that which seemed to her the least  terrible, \"Give me the poison, then,\" said she, \"and may God forgive you  my death!\"    With these words she took the glass, but the thick black liquid of which  it was full aroused such repulsion that she would have attempted a last  appeal; but a horrible imprecation from the abbe and a threatening  movement from his brother took from her the very last gleam of hope. She  put the glass to her lips, and murmuring once more, \"God! Saviour! have  pity on me!\" she swallowed the contents.    As she did so a few drops of the liquid fell upon her breast, and  instantly burned her skin like live coals; indeed, this infernal draught  was composed of arsenic and sublimate infused in aqua-fortis; then,  thinking that no more would be required of her, she dropped the glass.    The marquise was mistaken: the abbe picked it up, and observing that all  the sediment had remained at the bottom, he gathered together on a  silver bodkin all that had coagulated on the sides of the glass and all  that had sunk to the bottom, and presenting this ball, which was about  the size of a nut, to the marquise, on the end of the bodkin, he said,  \"Come, madame, you must swallow the holy-water sprinkler.\"    The marquise opened her lips, with resignation; but instead of doing as  the abbe commanded, she kept this remainder of the poison in her mouth,  threw herself on the bed with a scream, and clasping the pillows, in her  pain, she put out the poison between the sheets, unperceived by her  assassins; and then turning back to them, folded her hands in entreaty  and said, \"In the name of God, since you have killed my body, at least  do not destroy my soul, but send me a confessor.\"    Cruel though the abbe and the chevalier were, they were no doubt  beginning to weary of such a scene; moreover, the mortal deed was  accomplished--after what she had drunk, the marquise could live but a  few minutes; at her petition they went out, locking the door behind  them. But no sooner did the marquise find herself alone than the  possibility of flight presented itself to her. She ran to the window:  this was but twenty-two feet above the ground, but the earth below was  covered with stones and rubbish. The marquise, being only in her  nightdress, hastened to slip on a silk petticoat; but at the moment when  she finished tying it round her waist she heard a step approaching her  room, and believing that her murderers were returning to make an end of  her, she flew like a madwoman to the window. At the moment of her  setting foot on the window ledge, the door opened: the marquise, ceasing  to consider anything, flung herself down, head first.    Fortunately, the new-comer, who was the castle chaplain, had time to  reach out and seize her skirt. The skirt, not strong enough to bear the  weight of the marquise, tore; but its resistance, slight though it was,  sufficed nevertheless to change the direction of her body: the marquise,  whose head would have been shattered on the stones, fell on her feet  instead, and beyond their being bruised by the stones, received no  injury. Half stunned though she was by her fall, the marquise saw  something coming after her, and sprang aside. It was an enormous pitcher  of water, beneath which the priest, when he saw her escaping him, had  tried to crush her; but either because he had ill carried out his  attempt or because the marquise had really had time to move away, the  vessel was shattered at her feet without touching her, and the priest,  seeing that he had missed his aim, ran to warn the abbe and the  chevalier that the victim was escaping.    As for the marquise, she had hardly touched the ground, when with  admirable presence of mind she pushed the end of one of her long plaits  so far down her throat as to provoke a fit of vomiting; this was the  more easily done that she had eaten heartily of the collation, and  happily the presence of the food had prevented the poison from attacking  the coats of the stomach so violently as would otherwise have been the  case. Scarcely had she vomited when a tame boar swallowed what she had  rejected, and falling into a convulsion, died immediately.    As we have said, the room looked upon an enclosed courtyard; and the  marquise at first thought that in leaping from her room into this court  she had only changed her prison; but soon perceiving a light that  flickered from an upper window of ore of the stables, she ran thither,  and found a groom who was just going to bed.    \"In the name of Heaven, my good man,\" said she to him, \"save me! I am  poisoned! They want to kill me! Do not desert me, I entreat you! Have  pity on me, open this stable for me; let me get away! Let me escape!\"    The groom did not understand much of what the marquise said to him; but  seeing a woman with disordered hair, half naked, asking help of him, he  took her by the arm, led her through the stables, opened a door for her,  and the marquise found herself in the street. Two women were passing;  the groom put her into their hands, without being able to explain to  them what he did not know himself. As for the marquise, she seemed able  to say nothing beyond these words: \"Save me! I am poisoned! In the name  of Heaven, save me!\"    All at once she escaped from their hands and began to run like a mad  woman; she had seen, twenty steps away, on the threshold of the door by  which she had come, her two murderers in pursuit of her.    Then they rushed after her; she shrieking that she was poisoned, they  shrieking that she was mad; and all this happening amid a crowd which,  not knowing what part to take, divided and made way for the victim and  the murderers. Terror gave the marquise superhuman strength: the woman  who was accustomed to walk in silken shoes upon velvet carpets, ran with  bare and bleeding feet over stocks and stones, vainly asking help, which  none gave her; for, indeed, seeing her thus, in mad flight, in a  nightdress, with flying hair, her only garment a tattered silk  petticoat, it was difficult not to--think that this woman was, as her  brothers-in-law said, mad.    At last the chevalier came up with her, stopped her, dragged her, in  spite of her screams, into the nearest house, and closed the door behind  them, while the abbe, standing at the threshold with a pistol in his  hand, threatened to blow out the brains of any person who should  approach.    The house into which the chevalier and the marquise had gone belonged to  one M. Desprats, who at the moment was from home, and whose wife was  entertaining several of her friends. The marquise and the chevalier,  still struggling together, entered the room where the company was  assembled: as among the ladies present were several who also visited the  marquise, they immediately arose, in the greatest amazement, to give her  the assistance that she implored; but the chevalier hastily pushed them  aside, repeating that the marquise was mad. To this reiterated  accusation--to which, indeed, appearances lent only too great a  probability--the marquise replied by showing her burnt neck and her  blackened lips, and wringing her hands in pain, cried out that she was  poisoned, that she was going to die, and begged urgently for milk, or at  least for water. Then the wife of a Protestant minister, whose name was  Madame Brunel, slipped into her hand "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#6)"],[1," was all watery; that I was not so  dried by the sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette spying that my garments  were moist; and, lastly, that I was seized with a violent fever, owing  to the chill and the excitement of my discovery, an attack of delirium  supervening, during which I related the whole adventure; so that, guided  by my avowal, my governor found the pieces of the queen's letter inside  the bolster where I had concealed them.\"    \"Ah!\" said Aramis, \"now I understand.\"    \"Beyond this, all is conjecture. Doubtless the unfortunate lady and  gentleman, not daring to keep the occurrence secret, wrote of all this  to the queen and sent back the torn letter.\"    \"After which,\" said Aramis, \"you were arrested and removed to the  Bastile.\"    \"As you see.\"    \"Your two attendants disappeared?\"    \"Alas!\"    \"Let us not take up our time with the dead, but see what can be done  with the living. You told me you were resigned.\"    \"I repeat it.\"    \"Without any desire for freedom?\"    \"As I told you.\"    \"Without ambition, sorrow, or thought?\"    The young man made no answer.    \"Well,\" asked Aramis, \"why are you silent?\"    \"I think I have spoken enough,\" answered the prisoner, \"and that now it  is your turn. I am weary.\"    Aramis gathered himself up, and a shade of deep solemnity spread itself  over his countenance. It was evident that he had reached the crisis in  the part he had come to the prison to play. \"One question,\" said Aramis.    \"What is it? speak.\"    \"In the house you inhabited there were neither looking-glasses nor  mirrors?\"    \"What are those two words, and what is their meaning?\" asked the young  man; \"I have no sort of knowledge of them.\"    \"They designate two pieces of furniture which reflect objects; so that,  for instance, you may see in them your own lineaments, as you see mine  now, with the naked eye.\"    \"No; there was neither a glass nor a mirror in the house,\" answered the  young man.    Aramis looked round him. \"Nor is there anything of the kind here,  either,\" he said; \"they have again taken the same precaution.\"    \"To what end?\"    \"You will know directly. Now, you have told me that you were instructed  in mathematics, astronomy, fencing, and riding; but you have not said a  word about history.\"    \"My tutor sometimes related to me the principal deeds of the king, St.  Louis, King Francis I., and King Henry IV.\"    \"Is that all?\"    \"Very nearly.\"    \"This also was done by design, then; just as they deprived you of  mirrors, which reflect the present, so they left you in ignorance of  history, which reflects the past. Since your imprisonment, books have  been forbidden you; so that you are unacquainted with a number of facts,  by means of which you would be able to reconstruct the shattered mansion  of your recollections and your hopes.\"    \"It is true,\" said the young man.    \"Listen, then; I will in a few words tell you what has passed in France  during the last twenty-three or twenty-four years; that is, from the  probable date of your birth; in a word, from the time that interests  you.\"    \"Say on.\" And the young man resumed his serious and attentive attitude.    \"Do you know who was the son of Henry IV.?\"    \"At least I know who his successor was.\"    \"How?\"    \"By means of a coin dated 1610, which bears the effigy of Henry IV.; and  another of 1612, bearing that of Louis XIII. So I presumed that,  there being only two years between the two dates, Louis was Henry's  successor.\"    \"Then,\" said Aramis, \"you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis  XIII.?\"    \"I do,\" answered the youth, slightly reddening.    \"Well, he was a prince full of noble ideas and great projects, always,  alas! deferred by the trouble of the times and the dread struggle that  his minister Richelieu had to maintain against the great nobles of  France. The king himself was of a feeble character, and died young and  unhappy.\"    \"I know it.\"    \"He had been long anxious about having a heir; a care which weighs  heavily on princes, who desire to leave behind them more than one pledge  that their best thoughts and works will be continued.\"    \"Did the king, then, die childless?\" asked the prisoner, smiling.    \"No, but he was long without one, and for a long while thought he should  be the last of his race. This idea had reduced him to the depths of  despair, when suddenly, his wife, Anne of Austria--\"    The prisoner trembled.    \"Did you know,\" said Aramis, \"that Louis XIII.'s wife was called Anne of  Austria?\"    \"Continue,\" said the young man, without replying to the question.    \"When suddenly,\" resumed Aramis, \"the queen announced an interesting  event. There was great joy at the intelligence, and all prayed for her  happy delivery. On the 5th of September, 1638, she gave birth to a son.\"    Here Aramis looked at his companion, and thought he observed him turning  pale. \"You are about to hear,\" said Aramis, \"an account which few indeed  could now avouch; for it refers to a secret which they imagined buried  with the dead, entombed in the abyss of the confessional.\"    \"And you will tell me this secret?\" broke in the youth.    \"Oh!\" said Aramis, with unmistakable emphasis, \"I do not know that I  ought to risk this secret by intrusting it to one who has no desire to  quit the Bastile.\"    \"I hear you, monsieur.\"    \"The queen, then, gave birth to a son. But while the court was rejoicing  over the event, when the king had shown the new-born child to the  nobility and people, and was sitting gayly down to table, to celebrate  the event, the queen, who was alone in her room, was again taken ill and  gave birth to a second son.\"    \"Oh!\" said the prisoner, betraying a better acquaintance with affairs  than he had owned to, \"I thought that Monsieur was only born in--\"    Aramis raised his finger; \"Permit me to continue,\" he said.    The prisoner sighed impatiently, and paused.    \"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"the queen had a second son, whom Dame Perronnette,  the midwife, received in her arms.\"    \"Dame Perronnette!\" murmured the young man.    \"They ran at once to the banqueting-room, and whispered to the king what  had happened; he rose and quitted the table. But this time it was no  longer happiness that his face expressed, but something akin to terror.  The birth of twins changed into bitterness the joy to which that of an  only son had given rise, seeing that in France (a fact you are assuredly  ignorant of) it is the oldest of the king's sons who succeeds his  father.\"    \"I know it.\"    \"And that the doctors and jurists assert that there is ground for  doubting whether the son that first makes his appearance is the elder by  the law of heaven and of nature.\"    The prisoner uttered a smothered cry, and became whiter than the  coverlet under which he hid himself.    \"Now you understand,\" pursued Aramis, \"that the king, who with so much  pleasure saw himself repeated in one, was in despair about two; fearing  that the second might dispute the first's claim to seniority, which had  been recognized only two hours before; and so this second son, relying  on party interests and caprices, might one day sow discord and engender  civil war throughout the kingdom; by these means destroying the very  dynasty he should have strengthened.\"    \"Oh, I understand!--I understand!\" murmured the young man.    \"Well,\" continued Aramis; \"this is what they relate, what they declare;  this is why one of the queen's two sons, shamefully parted from his  brother, shamefully sequestered, is buried in profound obscurity; this  is why that second son has disappeared, and so completely, that not a  soul in France, save his mother, is aware of his existence.\"    \"Yes! his mother, who has cast him off,\" cried the prisoner in a tone of  despair.    \"Except, also,\" Aramis went on, \"the lady in the black dress; and,  finally, excepting--\"    \"Excepting yourself--is it not? You who come and relate all this; you,  who rouse in my soul curiosity, hatred, ambition, and, perhaps, even the  thirst of vengeance; except you, monsieur, who, if you are the man to  whom I expect, whom the note I have received applies to, whom, in short,  Heaven ought to send me, must possess about you--\"    \"What?\" asked Aramis.    \"A portrait of the king, Louis XIV., who at this moment reigns upon the  throne of France.\"    \"Here is the portrait,\" replied the bishop, handing the prisoner a  miniature in enamel, on which Louis was depicted life-like, with a  handsome, lofty mien. The prisoner eagerly seized the portrait, and  gazed at it with devouring eyes.    \"And now, monseigneur,\" said Aramis, \"here is a mirror.\" Aramis left the  prisoner time to recover his ideas.    \"So high!--so high!\" murmured the young man, eagerly comparing the  likeness of Louis with his own countenance reflected in the glass.    \"What do you think of it?\" at length said Aramis.    \"I think that I am lost,\" replied the captive; \"the king will never set  me free.\"    \"And I--I demand to know,\" added the bishop, fixing his piercing eyes  significantly upon the prisoner, \"I demand to know which of these two is  king; the one this miniature portrays, or whom the glass reflects?\"    \"The king, monsieur,\" sadly replied the young man, \"is he who is on  the throne, who is not in prison; and who, on the other hand, can cause  others to be entombed there. Royalty means power; and you behold how  powerless I am.\"    \"Monseigneur,\" answered Aramis, with a respect he had not yet  manifested, \"the king, mark me, will, if you desire it, be the one that,  quitting his dungeon, shall maintain himself upon the throne, on which  his friends will place him.\"    \"Tempt me not, monsieur,\" broke in the prisoner bitterly.    \"Be not weak, monseigneur,\" persisted Aramis; \"I have brought you all  the proofs of your birth; consult them; satisfy yourself that you are a  king's son; it is for _us_ to act.\"    \"No, no; it is impossible.\"    \"Unless, indeed,\" resumed the bishop ironically, \"it be the destiny of"]]]
