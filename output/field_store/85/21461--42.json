Natives are very fond of giving horses green gram, but it is a most  dangerous custom. It is most indigestible, the stalk when green being full  of a strong tough fibre. The sap and leaves have a peculiar irritating or  almost corrosive property, and in the spring of the year many fatal cases  of intestinal disease are caused by it.      Carrots (_gajar_).    Carrots are plentiful all over Northern India. They come on in the spring,  and are an excellent green food. They can be bought very cheaply, and if  kept in a cool, dry place, can be stored for a considerable time; but they  require to be turned almost daily, or they will get rotten. When used they  should either be washed to remove the earth, or, as in the East this is  quite dry, knocked with a stick to remove it. They should be given whole,  or else cut into long slices, not across into lumps. This latter practice  is dangerous, as horses are thus inclined to bolt them whole, and the  short round lump is likely to stick in the throat and cause choking.      Lucerne.    Lucerne grows well all over Northern India, and although not cultivated by  the natives for their own use, they know perfectly well what it is, and  call it by the English name. In most of the towns where there are any  Europeans collected together, it is usual to grow it in the Government or  station garden, from where it can be purchased retail. Some native corps,  who remain some time in the one place, also grow it for the benefit of the  regiment, and sometimes it is possible to obtain some from them; but as a  rule they only have enough for their own use. Round the large military  cantonments in some places, the neighbouring farmers, finding that there  is a demand for it, have taken to growing it for sale, and it can be  bought in the bazaar; but as the supply is not certain, it is better to  enter into a contract with one of the growers to supply the quantity by  weight daily required. In making this bargain it is best to use the agency  of the head \"syce,\" as if it falls short, or is not forthcoming, he can be  made responsible; and natives being erratic creatures, it is quite  possible that some morning you may be told that there is no more, or that  the grower has sold his crop to some one else, perhaps at even a smaller  price than you are giving. Whenever there is a well in the compound, and I  have been long enough in one place, I have always grown as much as I could  for myself. It is easily done, and there is no more useful crop in  connection with an Indian stable. In the dry, hot weather the difference  in the condition of horses that are getting a fairly liberal supply of  green food, and those that are only getting the burned-up grass that is  then procurable, is most marked. The only difficulty about growing lucerne  is that at first a large supply of water is necessary until the roots  strike. If you have a garden, then, of course, you have to keep a pair of  bullocks to raise water from the well for irrigation purposes; but if you  do not run to this luxury, then a pair of bullocks can be hired for two or  three days in the week. The landlord of the house has to keep the well and  the Persian wheel, by which the water is raised, in order, and find the  first pair of ropes for it. The tenant has to find the earthen pots, or  \"chatties,\" that are fastened on to it, by which the water is raised up.  These \"chatties\" are cheap things enough, but they are easily broken. I  always found that the best plan was to provide the first lot myself, and  then give a small sum monthly to the gardener to keep them going; and it  saved money in the end, as I found that not nearly so many were smashed  under this system as when I paid for what were required. If a gardener is  regularly employed, it is, of course, part of his business to look after  the lucerne bed; but for an ordinary stable of, say, four or five animals,  an acre of lucerne will be ample, and a man exclusively for this is not  necessary. A gardener can be got for about Rs. 10 a month, but a man can  be got to come two or three times a week and look after it for half this.  I found, however, that if I gave it to one of the syces, that the women  and children of his family would attend to it, as, when once started, it  only requires weeding, and that the work was better done than by a  professional gardener, unless one was regularly employed. The best seed is  the acclimatized English, or the Cabul brought down from Afghanistan. The  English seed can be obtained from any seedsman, or the Government  Horticultural Gardens at Lahore or Saharunpore, at about a rupee a pound,  and this is enough to sow about an acre with, which should be done at the  end of the cold weather. If only a small quantity is grown, it is best to  sow it on ridges, as it then, no doubt, can be kept free from weeds, and  the cost of weeding, on an acre or two, is but trifling; but it is an  error to suppose that lucerne cannot be sown broadcast. At the cattle farm  at Hissar, in the Punjab, several hundred acres were grown in this way, as  the cost of making ridges on such a large quantity of land would have been  prohibitive. Of course, this lucerne was not so clean as if it had been  grown on ridges, but the cattle picked it out from the weeds when it was  put before them. Fresh seed will have to be sown about every three years,  and the crop may be cut about five or six times during the season. About 4  lbs. is enough for a horse, but it is best to begin with half this  quantity and gradually increase it, as if too large an amount is given at  once it is likely to cause colic.      Guinea Grass.    Some years ago this was a very favourite grass forage to grow for horses,  but lately lucerne has supplanted it, and, I think, rightly. The advantage  of guinea grass is that it lasts through the hottest months of the year,  which lucerne does not, but it requires a great deal of water. It grows in  separate tufts, and they should be planted some distance apart, or  otherwise they will crowd each other out.      Sugar Cane (_gunna_).    Sugar cane is not often used as an actual food, but horses are very fond  of it, and on my visits to the stable I usually had some pieces carried  after me in a basket when it was in season. It ripens at the end of the  summer, and lasts into the winter. It is sold in long sticks, and should  be chopped up into pieces; but the servants will steal it, as they eat it  themselves as a sweetmeat.      Turnips (_shalgham_).    The ordinary white turnip grows all over the Punjab in the winter, and  when carrots are not to be procured, I have used them in their place,  preparing them in the same manner. Horses soon learn to eat and relish  them.      Salt (_nimmuk_).    Salt is required by all animals in a certain quantity in their food to  keep them in health. There are three different varieties sold in the  native shops. Rock salt (\"putter ke nimmuk\"); ordinary salt, which is  merely the rock salt crushed and powdered; and black salt (\"kali nimmuk\").  On the coast sea salt can also be obtained, but it is not to be found far  inland. The common custom in India is to give powdered salt in the food,  the usual daily allowance being about an ounce. I prefer to leave a lump  of rock salt in the manger for the horse to lick when he likes. Some  owners have a lump of it hung by a string to the wall, but I do not think  this is advisable, as I have known more than one horse turn a wind-sucker  from getting into the habit of licking and playing with it.      Tonics.    It is a common supposition, deeply rooted in the minds of horsemen, that,  when a horse loses condition, he at once requires a tonic; and an immense  number of these and \"condition powders\" are advertised. There is no better  paying speculation in the world than the sale of these articles, as the  majority of them consist of a few cheap and simple ingredients, that are  retailed to the public at a hundred per cent. their original cost; and the  best that can be said about these nostrums is that some of them are  innocent and do no harm, while they serve to amuse the owner. The action  of a tonic is to stimulate the appetite, and if the horse is feeding well  they are certainly useless, if not actually harmful. If the horse feeds,  and continues to fall off in condition, the chances are that there is  something wrong in the stable management, which should be carefully  inquired into. If this only occurs once with one animal, the inference is  that medical advice is required, but if several are in the same state, or  it is a matter of constant occurrence, then in most cases a change of  \"syce\" is required, and it will be usually found better and cheaper than  having recourse to any of these various advertised \"cure-alls.\"      Horses not Feeding.    Horses refuse their food from a variety of causes. It is usually the first  symptom noticed in the majority of attacks of illness, and I cannot too  strongly urge that in such cases the sooner professional advice is  obtained the better, there being nothing in which the old proverb, \"a  stitch in time saves nine,\" more applies to. On the other hand, horse  owners are inclined to get very anxious without cause about horses not  feeding, and to imagine that because he refuses to feed, or does not  finish it up with a good appetite, that the animal is in a dangerous  state. Horses are much like ourselves, and we all know that we sometimes  do not feel inclined to do justice to a \"square\" meal, and that if we dine  off a plate of soup we feel ready for a good breakfast in the morning. If  the horse refuses his feed, or only plays about with it, have it at once  removed; at the next only give him a little hay or grass, and the  probabilities are that at the next he will eat up his grain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#6)"],[1,"e, 3 km.

Grayish to dark brownish above and lighter below; sutures  of interparietal bone distinct throughout life; second to fourth  cervical vertebrae broader than long with dorsal surface flattened and  without carination.    The delectable flesh of members of this genus, the large numbers that  occur on a small area, even in thickly settled rural areas, and the  wariness that rabbits soon develop when much hunted, give them top  ranking among small game mammals. Tens of thousands of cottontails in  Kansas and Missouri (_Sylvilagus floridanus_ and some _S. audubonii_)  are captured alive, transported to the eastern United States and  released there to bolster the local supply of game. Considering that  certain ectoparasites are limited to certain hosts and that some  ectoparasites transmit such diseases as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever  whereas other ectoparasites do not, this transplantation of rabbits is  dangerous. Also, expenditure of $100.00 on improving the habitat for  _Sylvilagus_ in a given area in the eastern United States would produce  more cottontails than the expenditure of the same sum for live animals,  from the Middlewest, that are to be released (see Langenbach and Beule,  1942:14, 15 and 30).    Different species venture different distances from cover to feed. The  Audubon cottontail of west-central California ventures a hundred feet  and more from cover but the brush rabbit was never seen (Orr, 1940:182)  farther than 42 feet from cover. In the thirties, when a gladiolus  farmer from the chaparral belt of Santa Clara County, California,  visited the University of California seeking advice on how to prevent  damage by \"cottontails\" to his gladioli plantings, we asked the farmer  if brush rabbits or cottontails were responsible and suggested to the  farmer, who was unable to distinguish between the two, that an animal be  killed and submitted for identification. When this was done, the brush  rabbit (_Sylvilagus bachmani_) was found to be responsible for the  damage. Robert T. Orr's recommendation that the chaparral (brush) be cut  back 45 feet from the gladioli plantings was reluctantly followed and  proved to be effective. A letter from a Santa Clara County agricultural  official a couple of years later expressed thanks for the recommendation  made by Orr, and estimated that adoption of his recommendations saved  farmers of that one county $40,000 annually. This incident illustrates  how detailed knowledge of the life history of a given kind of animal and  control of its environment, rather than direct \"control\" of the animal,  is sometimes of value to man.    The genus _Sylvilagus_ is restricted to the New World; the two species  _Sylvilagus brasiliensis_ and _S. floridanus_ are the only two which  occur in South America and they occur also in North America.

The many nominal species of the subgenus _Sylvilagus_ belong to no more  than 12 and perhaps to only ten full species. The now more abundant  specimens than were available a half century ago reveal also that there  are less trenchant differences between some of the species than were  supposed to exist when the five names for genera or subgenera listed  immediately above were proposed. Some species can be placed in each of  two subgenera with almost equal propriety. If used, four of the five  subgeneric names mentioned above would contain only one species each. It  seems that no useful purpose is served by attempting to fit the several  species of the genus _Sylvilagus_ into more than the two subgenera  _Brachylagus_ and _Sylvilagus_; the other names, _Tapeti_ Gray,  _Microlagus_ Trouessart, _Limnolagus_ Mearns, and _Paludilagus_  Hershkovitz, are here arranged as synonyms of the subgeneric name  _Sylvilagus_ Gray.
