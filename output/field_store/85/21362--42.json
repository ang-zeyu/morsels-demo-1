In the glass jars in which I kept my Sitares I saw the pairing follow  very closely upon the first moments of freedom. I even witnessed a  fact which shows emphatically how imperious, in the perfect insect, is  the need to perform, without delay, the act intended to ensure the  preservation of its race. A female, with her head already cut out of  the shell, is anxiously struggling to release herself entirely; a  male, who has been free for a couple of hours, climbs on the shell  and, tugging here and there, with his mandibles, at the fragile  envelope, strives to deliver the female from her shackles. His efforts  are soon crowned with success; and, though the female is still three  parts swathed in her swaddling-bands, the coupling takes place  immediately, lasting about a minute. During the act, the male remains  motionless on the top of the shell, or on the top of the female when  the latter is entirely free. I do not know whether, in ordinary  circumstances, the male occasionally thus helps the female to gain her  liberty; to do so he would have to penetrate into a cell containing a  female, which, after all, is not beyond his powers, seeing that he has  been able to escape from his own. Still, on the actual site of the  cells, the coupling is generally performed at the entrance to the  galleries of the Anthophorae; and then neither of the sexes drags  about with it the least shred of the shell from which it has emerged.    After mating, the two Sitares proceed to clean their legs and antennae  by drawing them between their mandibles; then each goes his own way.  The male cowers in a crevice of the earthen bank, lingers for two or  three days and perishes. The female also, after getting rid of her  eggs, which she does without delay, dies at the entrance to the  corridor in which the eggs are laid. This is the origin of all those  corpses swinging in the Spiders' web with which the neighbourhood of  the Anthophora's dwellings is upholstered.    Thus the Sitares in the perfect state live long enough only to mate  and to lay their eggs. I have never seen one save upon the scene of  their loves, which is also that of their death; I have never surprised  one browsing on the plants near at hand, so that, though they are  provided with a normal digestive apparatus, I have grave reasons to  doubt whether they actually take any nourishment whatever. What a life  is theirs! A fortnight's feasting in a storehouse of honey; a year of  slumber underground; a minute of love in the sunlight; then death!    Once fertilized, restlessly the female at once proceeds to seek a  favourable spot wherein to lay her eggs. It was important to note  where this exact spot is. Does the female go from cell to cell,  confiding an egg to the succulent flanks of each larva, whether this  larva belong to the Anthophora or to a parasite of hers, as the  mysterious shell whence the Sitaris emerges would incline one to  believe? This method of laying the eggs, one at a time in each cell,  would appear to be essential, if we are to explain the facts already  ascertained. But then why do the cells usurped by the Sitares retain  not the slightest trace of the forcible entry which is indispensable?  And how is it that, in spite of lengthy investigations during which my  perseverance has been kept up by the keenest desire to cast some light  upon all these mysteries, how is it, I say, that I have never come  across a single specimen of the supposed parasites to which the shell  might be attributed, since this shell appears not to be a Beetle's?  The reader would hardly suspect how my slight acquaintance with  entomology was unsettled by this inextricable maze of contradictory  facts. But patience! We may yet obtain some light.    Let us begin by observing precisely at what spot the eggs are laid. A  female has just been fertilized before my eyes; she is forthwith  placed in a large glass jar, into which I put, at the same time, some  clods of earth containing Anthophora-cells. These cells are occupied  partly by larvae and partly by nymphs that are still quite white; some  are slightly open and afford a glimpse of their contents. Lastly, in  the inner surface of the cork which closes the jar I sink a  cylindrical well, a blind alley, of the same diameter as the corridors  of the Anthophora. In order that the insect, if it so desire, may  enter this artificial corridor, I lay the bottle horizontally.    The female, painfully dragging her big abdomen, perambulates all the  nooks and corners of her makeshift dwelling, exploring them with her  palpi, which she passes everywhere. After half an hour of groping and  careful investigation, she ends by selecting the horizontal gallery  dug in the cork. She thrusts her abdomen into this cavity and, with  her head hanging outside, begins her laying. Not until thirty-six  hours later was the operation completed; and during this incredible  lapse of time the patient creature remained absolutely motionless.    The eggs are white, oval and very small. They measure barely  two-thirds of a millimetre[8] in length. They stick together slightly  and are piled in a shapeless heap which might be likened to a  good-sized pinch of the unripe seeds of some orchid. As for their  number, I will admit that it tried my patience to no purpose. I do  not, however, believe that I am exaggerating when I estimate it as at  least two thousand. Here are the data on which I base this figure: the  laying, as I have said, lasts thirty-six hours; and my frequent visits  to the female working in the cavity in the cork convinced me that  there was no perceptible interruption in the successive emission of  the eggs. Now less than a minute elapses between the arrival of one  egg and that of the next; and the number of these eggs cannot  therefore be lower than the number of minutes contained in thirty-six  hours, or 2160. But the exact number is of no importance: we need only  note that it is very large, which implies, for the young larvae  issuing from the eggs, very numerous chances of destruction, since so  lavish a supply of germs is necessary to maintain the species in the  requisite proportions.    [Footnote 8: .026 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]    Enlightened by these observations and informed of the shape, the  number and the arrangement of the eggs, I searched the galleries of  the Anthophorae for those which the Sitares had laid there and  invariably found them gathered in a heap inside the galleries, at a  distance of an inch or two from the orifice, which is always open to  the outer world. Thus, contrary to what one was to some extent  entitled to suppose, the eggs are not laid in the cells of the pioneer  Bee; they are simply dumped in a heap inside the entrance to her  dwelling. Nay more, the mother does not make any protective structure  for them; she takes no pains to shield them from the rigours of  winter; she does not even attempt, by stopping for a short distance,  as best she can, the entrance-lobby in which she has laid them, to  protect them from the thousand enemies that threaten them; for, as  long as the frosts of winter have not arrived, these open galleries  are trodden by Spiders, by Acari, by Anthrenus-grubs and other  plunderers, to whom these eggs, or the young larvae about to emerge  from them, must be a dainty feast. In consequence of the mother's  heedlessness, the number of those who escape all these voracious  hunters and the inclemencies of the weather must be curiously small.  This perhaps explains why she is compelled to make up by her fecundity  for her deficient industry.    The hatching occurs a month later, about the end of September or the  beginning of October. The season being still propitious, I was led to  suppose that the young larvae must at once make a start and disperse,  in order that each might seek to gain access, through some  imperceptible fissure, to an Anthophora-cell. This presumption turned  out to be entirely at fault. In the boxes in which I had placed the  eggs laid by my captives, the young larvae, little black creatures at  most a twenty-fifth of an inch long, did not move away, provided  though they were with vigorous legs; they remained higgledy-piggledy  with the white skins of the eggs whence they had emerged.    In vain I placed within their reach lumps of earth containing nests of  the Anthophora, open cells, larvae and nymphs of the Bee: nothing was  able to tempt them; they persisted in forming, with the egg-skins, a  powdery heap of speckled black and white. It was only by drawing the  point of a needle through this pinch of living dust that I was able to  provoke an active wriggling. Apart from this, all was still. If I  forcibly removed a few larvae from the common heap, they at once  hurried back to it, in order to hide themselves among the rest.  Perhaps they had less reason to fear the cold when thus collected and  sheltered beneath the egg-skins. Whatever may be the motive that  impels them to remain thus gathered in a heap, I recognized that none  of the means suggested by my imagination succeeded in forcing them to  abandon the little spongy mass formed by the skins of the eggs, which  were slightly glued together. Lastly, to assure myself that the  larvae, in the free state, do not disperse after they are hatched, I  went during the winter to Carpentras and inspected the banks inhabited  by the Anthophorae. There, as in my boxes, I found the larvae piled  into heaps, all mixed up with the skins of the eggs.          CHAPTER III  THE PRIMARY LARVA OF THE SITARES      Nothing new happens before the end of the following April. I shall  profit by this long period of repose to tell you more about the young  larva, of which I will begin by giving a description. Its length is a  twenty-fifth of an inch, or a little less. It is hard as leather, a  glossy greenish black, convex above and flat below, long and slender,  with a diameter increasing gradually "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#6)"],[1,"c-book propped up before him  in the sunny window, while Spring beauty filled the world outside, and  Sabbath silence reigned within, Nat enjoyed an hour or two of genuine  happiness, learning the sweet old tunes, and forgetting the hard past in  the cheerful present.    When the church-goers came back and dinner was over, every one read,  wrote letters home, said their Sunday lessons, or talked quietly to one  another, sitting here and there about the house. At three o'clock the  entire family turned out to walk, for all the active young bodies must  have exercise; and in these walks the active young minds were taught  to see and love the providence of God in the beautiful miracles which  Nature was working before their eyes. Mr. Bhaer always went with them,  and in his simple, fatherly way, found for his flock, \"Sermons in  stones, books in the running brooks, and good in everything.\"    Mrs. Bhaer with Daisy and her own two boys drove into town, to pay the  weekly visit to Grandma, which was busy Mother Bhaer's one holiday and  greatest pleasure. Nat was not strong enough for the long walk, and  asked to stay at home with Tommy, who kindly offered to do the honors  of Plumfield. \"You've seen the house, so come out and have a look at  the garden, and the barn, and the menagerie,\" said Tommy, when they were  left alone with Asia, to see that they didn't get into mischief;  for, though Tommy was one of the best-meaning boys who ever adorned  knickerbockers, accidents of the most direful nature were always  happening to him, no one could exactly tell how.    \"What is your menagerie?\" asked Nat, as they trotted along the drive  that encircled the house.    \"We all have pets, you see, and we keep 'em in the corn-barn, and call  it the menagerie. Here you are. Isn't my guinea-pig a beauty?\" and Tommy  proudly presented one of the ugliest specimens of that pleasing animal  that Nat ever saw.    \"I know a boy with a dozen of 'em, and he said he'd give me one, only I  hadn't any place to keep it, so I couldn't have it. It was white, with  black spots, a regular rouser, and maybe I could get it for you if you'd  like it,\" said Nat, feeling it would be a delicate return for Tommy's  attentions.    \"I'd like it ever so much, and I'll give you this one, and they can live  together if they don't fight. Those white mice are Rob's, Franz gave  'em to him. The rabbits are Ned's, and the bantams outside are Stuffy's.  That box thing is Demi's turtle-tank, only he hasn't begun to get 'em  yet. Last year he had sixty-two, whackers some of 'em. He stamped one of  'em with his name and the year, and let it go; and he says maybe he will  find it ever so long after and know it. He read about a turtle being  found that had a mark on it that showed it must be hundreds of years  old. Demi's such a funny chap.\"    \"What is in this box?\" asked Nat, stopping before a large deep one,  half-full of earth.    \"Oh, that's Jack Ford's worm-shop. He digs heaps of 'em and keeps 'em  here, and when we want any to go afishing with, we buy some of him. It  saves lots of trouble, only he charged too much for 'em. Why, last time  we traded I had to pay two cents a dozen, and then got little ones.  Jack's mean sometimes, and I told him I'd dig for myself if he didn't  lower his prices. Now, I own two hens, those gray ones with top knots,  first-rate ones they are too, and I sell Mrs. Bhaer the eggs, but I  never ask her more than twenty-five cents a dozen, never! I'd be ashamed  to do it,\" cried Tommy, with a glance of scorn at the worm-shop.    \"Who owns the dogs?\" asked Nat, much interested in these commercial  transactions, and feeling that T. Bangs was a man whom it would be a  privilege and a pleasure to patronize.    \"The big dog is Emil's. His name is Christopher Columbus. Mrs. Bhaer  named him because she likes to say Christopher Columbus, and no one  minds it if she means the dog,\" answered Tommy, in the tone of a  show-man displaying his menagerie. \"The white pup is Rob's, and the  yellow one is Teddy's. A man was going to drown them in our pond, and  Pa Bhaer wouldn't let him. They do well enough for the little chaps, I  don't think much of 'em myself. Their names are Castor and Pollux.\"    \"I'd like Toby the donkey best, if I could have anything, it's so nice  to ride, and he's so little and good,\" said Nat, remembering the weary  tramps he had taken on his own tired feet.    \"Mr. Laurie sent him out to Mrs. Bhaer, so she shouldn't carry Teddy  on her back when we go to walk. We're all fond of Toby, and he's a  first-rate donkey, sir. Those pigeons belong to the whole lot of us, we  each have our pet one, and go shares in all the little ones as they come  along. Squabs are great fun; there ain't any now, but you can go up and  take a look at the old fellows, while I see if Cockletop and Granny have  laid any eggs.\"    Nat climbed up a ladder, put his head through a trap door and took a  long look at the pretty doves billing and cooing in their spacious loft.  Some on their nests, some bustling in and out, and some sitting at  their doors, while many went flying from the sunny housetop to the  straw-strewn farmyard, where six sleek cows were placidly ruminating.    \"Everybody has got something but me. I wish I had a dove, or a hen, or  even a turtle, all my own,\" thought Nat, feeling very poor as he saw the  interesting treasures of the other boys. \"How do you get these things?\"  he asked, when he joined Tommy in the barn.    \"We find 'em or buy 'em, or folks give 'em to us. My father sends me  mine; but as soon as I get egg money enough, I'm going to buy a pair of  ducks. There's a nice little pond for 'em behind the barn, and people  pay well for duck-eggs, and the little duckies are pretty, and it's fun  to see 'em swim,\" said Tommy, with the air of a millionaire.    Nat sighed, for he had neither father nor money, nothing in the wide  world but an old empty pocketbook, and the skill that lay in his ten  finger tips. Tommy seemed to understand the question and the sigh which  followed his answer, for after a moment of deep thought, he suddenly  broke out,    \"Look here, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you will hunt eggs for me, I  hate it, I'll give you one egg out of every dozen. You keep account, and  when you've had twelve, Mother Bhaer will give you twenty-five cents for  'em, and then you can buy what you like, don't you see?\"    \"I'll do it! What a kind feller you are, Tommy!\" cried Nat, quite  dazzled by this brilliant offer.    \"Pooh! that is not anything. You begin now and rummage the barn, and  I'll wait here for you. Granny is cackling, so you're sure to find one  somewhere,\" and Tommy threw himself down on the hay with a luxurious  sense of having made a good bargain, and done a friendly thing.    Nat joyfully began his search, and went rustling from loft to loft till  he found two fine eggs, one hidden under a beam, and the other in an old  peck measure, which Mrs. Cockletop had appropriated.    \"You may have one and I'll have the other, that will just make up my  last dozen, and to-morrow we'll start fresh. Here, you chalk your  accounts up near mine, and then we'll be all straight,\" said Tommy,  showing a row of mysterious figures on the side of an old winnowing  machine.    With a delightful sense of importance, the proud possessor of one egg  opened his account with his friend, who laughingly wrote above the  figures these imposing words,    \"T. Bangs & Co.\"    Poor Nat found them so fascinating that he was with difficulty persuaded  to go and deposit his first piece of portable property in Asia's  store-room. Then they went on again, and having made the acquaintance  of the two horses, six cows, three pigs, and one Alderney \"Bossy,\"  as calves are called in New England, Tommy took Nat to a certain old  willow-tree that overhung a noisy little brook. From the fence it was  an easy scramble into a wide niche between the three big branches, which  had been cut off to send out from year to year a crowd of slender twigs,  till a green canopy rustled overhead. Here little seats had been fixed,  and a hollow place a closet made big enough to hold a book or two, a  dismantled boat, and several half-finished whistles.    \"This is Demi's and my private place; we made it, and nobody can come up  unless we let 'em, except Daisy, we don't mind her,\" said Tommy, as Nat  looked with delight from the babbling brown water below to the green  arch above, where bees were making a musical murmur as they feasted on  the long yellow blossoms that filled the air with sweetness.    \"Oh, it's just beautiful!\" cried Nat. \"I do hope you'll let me up  sometimes. I never saw such a nice place in all my life. I'd like to be  a bird, and live here always.\"    \"It is pretty nice. You can come if Demi don't mind, and I guess he  won't, because he said last night that he liked you.\"    \"Did he?\" and Nat smiled with pleasure, for Demi's regard seemed to be  valued by all the boys, partly because he was Father Bhaer's nephew, and  partly because he was such a sober, conscientious little fellow.    \"Yes; Demi likes quiet chaps, and I guess he and you will get on if you  care about reading as he does.\"    Poor Nat's flush of pleasure deepened to a painful scarlet at those last  words, and he stammered out,    \"I can't read very well; I never had any time; I was always fiddling  round, you know.\"    \"I don't love it myself, but I can do it well enough when I want to,\"  said Tommy, after a surprised look, which said as plainly as words, \"A  boy twelve years old and can't read!\"    \"I can read music, anyway,\" added Nat, rather ruffled at having to  confess his ignorance.    \"I can't;\" and Tommy spoke in a respectful tone, which emboldened Nat to  say firmly,    \"I mean to study real hard and learn every thing I can, for I never had  a chance before. Does Mr. Bhaer give hard lessons?\"    \"No; he isn't a bit cross; he sort of explains and gives you a boost"]]]
