It was not much, you say, that these    Should win their way where none withstood;    In sooth there was not much of blood    No war was fought between the seas.      It was not much! but we who know    The strange capricious land they trod --    At times a stricken, parching sod,    At times with raging floods beset --    Through which they found their lonely way,    Are quite content that you should say    It was not much, while we can feel    That nothing in the ages old,    In song or story written yet    On Grecian urn or Roman arch,    Though it should ring with clash of steel,    Could braver histories unfold    Than this bush story, yet untold --    The story of their westward march.           .    .    .    .    .      But times are changed, and changes rung    From old to new -- the olden days,    The old bush life and all its ways    Are passing from us all unsung.    The freedom, and the hopeful sense    Of toil that brought due recompense,    Of room for all, has passed away,    And lies forgotten with the dead.    Within our streets men cry for bread    In cities built but yesterday.      About us stretches wealth of land,    A boundless wealth of virgin soil    As yet unfruitful and untilled!    Our willing workmen, strong and skilled    Within our cities idle stand,    And cry aloud for leave to toil.      The stunted children come and go    In squalid lanes and alleys black;    We follow but the beaten track    Of other nations, and we grow    In wealth for some -- for many, woe.      And it may be that we who live    In this new land apart, beyond    The hard old world grown fierce and fond    And bound by precedent and bond,    May read the riddle right and give    New hope to those who dimly see    That all things may be yet for good,    And teach the world at length to be    One vast united brotherhood.           .    .    .    .    .      So may it be, and he who sings    In accents hopeful, clear, and strong,    The glories which that future brings    Shall sing, indeed, a wond'rous song.          Anthony Considine          Out in the wastes of the West countrie,     Out where the white stars shine,    Grim and silent as such men be,    Rideth a man with a history --     Anthony Considine.      For the ways of men they are manifold     As their differing views in life;    For some are sold for the lust of gold     And some for the lust of strife:    But this man counted the world well lost     For the love of his neighbour's wife.      They fled together, as those must flee     Whom all men hold in blame;    Each to the other must all things be    Who cross the gulf of iniquity     And live in the land of shame.      But a light-o'-love, if she sins with one,     She sinneth with ninety-nine:    The rule holds good since the world begun --    Since ever the streams began to run     And the stars began to shine.    The rule holds true, and he found it true --     Anthony Considine.      A nobler spirit had turned in scorn     From a love that was stained with mire;    A weaker being might mourn and mourn     For the loss of his Heart's Desire:    But the anger of Anthony Considine     Blazed up like a flaming fire.      And she, with her new love, presently     Came past with her eyes ashine;    And God so willed it, and God knows why,    She turned and laughed as they passed him by --     Anthony Considine.      Her laughter stung as a whip might sting;     And mad with his wounded pride    He turned and sprang with a panther's spring     And struck at his rival's side:    And only the woman, shuddering,     Could tell how the dead man died!      She dared not speak -- and the mystery     Is buried in auld lang syne,    But out on the wastes of the West countrie,    Grim and silent as such men be,    Rideth a man with a history --     Anthony Considine.          Song of the Artesian Water          Now the stock have started dying, for the Lord has sent a drought;    But we're sick of prayers and Providence -- we're going to do without;    With the derricks up above us and the solid earth below,    We are waiting at the lever for the word to let her go.        Sinking down, deeper down,        Oh, we'll sink it deeper down:    As the drill is plugging downward at a thousand feet of level,    If the Lord won't send us water, oh, we'll get it from the devil;    Yes, we'll get it from the devil deeper down.      Now, our engine's built in Glasgow by a very canny Scot,    And he marked it twenty horse-power, but he don't know what is what:    When Canadian Bill is firing with the sun-dried gidgee logs,    She can equal thirty horses and a score or so of dogs.        Sinking down, deeper down,        Oh, we're going deeper down:    If we fail to get the water then it's ruin to the squatter,    For the drought is on the station and the weather's growing hotter,    But we're bound to get the water deeper down.      But the shaft has started caving and the sinking's very slow,    And the yellow rods are bending in the water down below,    And the tubes are always jamming and they can't be made to shift    Till we nearly burst the engine with a forty horse-power lift.        Sinking down, deeper down,        Oh, we're going deeper down    Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes are always jamming,    Yet we'll fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming --    While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.      But there's no artesian water, though we've passed three thousand feet,    And the contract price is growing and the boss is nearly beat.    But it must be down beneath us, and it's down we've got to go,    Though she's bumping on the solid rock four thousand feet below.        Sinking down, deeper down,        Oh, we're going deeper down:    And it's time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satan's dwellin';    But we'll get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in --    Oh! we'll get artesian water deeper down.      But it's hark! the whistle's blowing with a wild, exultant blast,    And the boys are madly cheering, for they've struck the flow at last,    And it's rushing up the tubing from four thousand feet below    Till it spouts above the casing in a million-gallon flow.        And it's down, deeper down --        Oh, it comes from deeper down;    It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free, unstinted measure    From the silent hidden places where the old earth hides her treasure --    Where the old earth hides her treasure deeper down.      And it's clear away the timber, and it's let the water run:    How it glimmers in the shadow, how it flashes in the sun!    By the silent belts of timber, by the miles of blazing plain    It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again.        Flowing down, further down;        It is flowing further down    To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing gladness in its going;    Through the droughty days of summer it is flowing, ever flowing --    It is flowing, ever flowing, further down.          A Disqualified Jockey's Story          You see, the thing was this way -- there was me,    That rode Panoppoly, the Splendor mare,    And Ikey Chambers on the Iron Dook,    And Smith, the half-caste rider, on Regret,    And that long bloke from Wagga -- him what rode    Veronikew, the Snowy River horse.    Well, none of them had chances -- not a chance    Among the lot, unless the rest fell dead    Or wasn't trying -- for a blind man's dog    Could see Enchantress was a certain cop,    And all the books was layin' six to four.      They brought her out to show our lot the road,    Or so they said; but, then, Gord's truth! you know,    You can't believe 'em, though they took an oath    On forty Bibles that they'd tell the truth.    But anyhow, an amateur was up    On this Enchantress, and so Ike and me,    We thought that we might frighten him a bit    By asking if he minded riding rough --    'Oh, not at all,' says he, 'oh, not at all!    I learnt at Robbo Park, and if it comes    To bumping I'm your Moses!  Strike me blue!'    Says he, 'I'll bump you over either rail,    The inside rail or outside -- which you choose    Is good enough for me' -- which settled Ike;    For he was shaky since he near got killed    From being sent a buster on the rail,    When some chap bumped his horse and fetched him down    At Stony Bridge, so Ikey thought it best    To leave this bloke alone, and I agreed.      So all the books was layin' six to four    Against the favourite, and the amateur    Was walking this Enchantress up and down,    And me and Smithy backed him; for we thought    We might as well get something for ourselves,    Because we knew our horses couldn't win.    But Ikey wouldn't back him for a bob;    Because he said he reckoned he was stiff,    And all the books was layin' six to four.      Well, anyhow, before the start, the news    Got round that this here amateur was stiff,    And our good stuff was blued, and all the books    Was in it, and the prices lengthened out,    And every book was bustin' of his throat,    And layin' five to one the favourite.    So there was we that couldn't win ourselves,    And this here amateur that wouldn't try,    And all the books was layin' five to one.      So Smithy says to me, 'You take a hold    Of that there moke of yours, and round the turn    Come up behind Enchantress with the whip    And let her have it; that long bloke and me    Will wait ahead, and when she comes to us    We'll pass her on and belt her down the straight,    And Ikey'll flog her home, because his boss    Is judge and steward and the Lord knows what,    And so he won't be touched -- and, as for us,    We'll swear we only hit her by mistake!'    And all the books was layin' five to one.      Well, off we went, and comin' to the turn    I saw the amateur was holding back    And poking into every hole he could    To get her blocked, and so I pulled behind"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30411"],[0,"English as she is spoke; or, a jest in sober earnest (#6)"],[1,"dance.
