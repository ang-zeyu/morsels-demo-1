Two Whig members of the House of Commons were in the  Commission, Sir Henry Capel, brother of that Earl of Essex who died by  his own hand in the Tower, and Richard Hampden, son of the great leader  of the Long Parliament. But the Commissioner on whom the chief weight of  business lay was Godolphin. This man, taciturn, clearminded, laborious,  inoffensive, zealous for no government and useful to every government,  had gradually become an almost indispensable part of the machinery of  the state. Though a churchman, he had prospered in a Court governed by  Jesuits. Though he had voted for a Regency, he was the real head of a  treasury filled with Whigs. His abilities and knowledge, which had in  the late reign supplied the deficiencies of Bellasyse and Dover, were  now needed to supply the deficiencies of Mordaunt and Delamere. [20]    There were some difficulties in disposing of the Great Seal. The King  at first wished to confide it to Nottingham, whose father had borne it  during several years with high reputation. [21] Nottingham, however,  declined the trust; and it was offered to Halifax, but was again  declined. Both these Lords doubtless felt that it was a trust which they  could not discharge with honour to themselves or with advantage to  the public. In old times, indeed, the Seal had been generally held by  persons who were not lawyers. Even in the seventeenth century it had  been confided to two eminent men, who had never studied at any Inn  of Court. Dean Williams had been Lord Keeper to James the First.  Shaftesbury had been Lord Chancellor to Charles the Second. But such  appointments could no longer be made without serious inconvenience.  Equity had been gradually shaping itself into a refined science, which  no human faculties could master without long and intense application.  Even Shaftesbury, vigorous as was his intellect, had painfully felt his  want of technical knowledge; [22] and, during the fifteen years which had  elapsed since Shaftesbury had resigned the Seal, technical knowledge  had constantly been becoming more and more necessary to his successors.  Neither Nottingham therefore, though he had a stock of legal learning  such as is rarely found in any person who has not received a legal  education, nor Halifax, though, in the judicial sittings of the House  of Lords, the quickness of his apprehension and the subtlety of his  reasoning had often astonished the bar, ventured to accept the highest  office which an English layman can fill. After some delay the Seal was  confided to a commission of eminent lawyers, with Maynard at their head.  [23]    The choice of judges did honour to the new government. Every Privy  Councillor was directed to bring a list. The lists were compared; and  twelve men of conspicuous merit were selected. [24] The professional  attainments and Whig principles of Pollexfen gave him pretensions to  the highest place. But it was remembered that he had held briefs for the  Crown, in the Western counties, at the assizes which followed the battle  of Sedgemoor. It seems indeed from the reports of the trials that he did  as little as he could do if he held the briefs at all, and that he  left to the Judges the business of browbeating witnesses and prisoners.  Nevertheless his name was inseparably associated in the public mind with  the Bloody Circuit. He, therefore, could not with propriety be put at  the head of the first criminal court in the realm. [25] After acting  during a few weeks as Attorney General, he was made Chief Justice of the  Common Pleas. Sir John Holt, a young man, but distinguished by learning,  integrity, and courage, became Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Sir  Robert Atkyns, an eminent lawyer, who had passed some years in rural  retirement, but whose reputation was still great in Westminster Hall,  was appointed Chief Baron. Powell, who had been disgraced on account  of his honest declaration in favour of the Bishops, again took his seat  among the judges. Treby succeeded Pollexfen as Attorney General; and  Somers was made Solicitor. [26]    Two of the chief places in the Royal household were filled by two  English noblemen eminently qualified to adorn a court. The high spirited  and accomplished Devonshire was named Lord Steward. No man had done more  or risked more for England during the crisis of her fate. In retrieving  her liberties he had retrieved also the fortunes of his own house. His  bond for thirty thousand pounds was found among the papers which James  had left at Whitehall, and was cancelled by William. [27]    Dorset became Lord Chamberlain, and employed the influence and patronage  annexed to his functions, as he had long employed his private means, in  encouraging genius and in alleviating misfortune. One of the first acts  which he was under the necessity of performing must have been painful to  a man of so generous a nature, and of so keen a relish for whatever  was excellent in arts and letters. Dryden could no longer remain Poet  Laureate. The public would not have borne to see any Papist among the  servants of their Majesties; and Dryden was not only a Papist, but  an apostate. He had moreover aggravated the guilt of his apostasy by  calumniating and ridiculing the Church which he had deserted. He had,  it was facetiously said, treated her as the Pagan persecutors of old  treated her children. He had dressed her up in the skin of a wild beast,  and then baited her for the public amusement. [28] He was removed; but  he received from the private bounty of the magnificent Chamberlain  a pension equal to the salary which had been withdrawn. The deposed  Laureate, however, as poor of spirit as rich in intellectual gifts,  continued to complain piteously, year after year, of the losses which he  had not suffered, till at length his wailings drew forth expressions  of well merited contempt from brave and honest Jacobites, who had  sacrificed every thing to their principles without deigning to utter one  word of deprecation or lamentation. [29]    In the Royal household were placed some of those Dutch nobles who stood  highest in the favour of the King. Bentinck had the great office of  Groom of the Stole, with a salary of five thousand pounds a year.  Zulestein took charge of the robes. The Master of the Horse was  Auverquerque, a gallant soldier, who united the blood of Nassau to the  blood of Horn, and who wore with just pride a costly sword presented to  him by the States General in acknowledgment of the courage with which he  had, on the bloody day of Saint Dennis, saved the life of William.    The place of Vice Chamberlain to the Queen was given to a man who had  just become conspicuous in public life, and whose name will frequently  recur in the history of this reign. John Howe, or, as he was more  commonly called, Jack Howe, had been sent up to the Convention by the  borough of Cirencester. His appearance was that of a man whose body was  worn by the constant workings of a restless and acrid mind. He was tall,  lean, pale, with a haggard eager look, expressive at once of flightiness  and of shrewdness. He had been known, during several years, as a small  poet; and some of the most savage lampoons which were handed about the  coffeehouses were imputed to him. But it was in the House of Commons  that both his parts and his illnature were most signally displayed.  Before he had been a member three weeks, his volubility, his asperity,  and his pertinacity had made him conspicuous. Quickness, energy, and  audacity, united, soon raised him to the rank of a privileged man. His  enemies, and he had many enemies, said that he consulted his personal  safety even in his most petulant moods, and that he treated soldiers  with a civility which he never showed to ladies or to Bishops. But no  man had in larger measure that evil courage which braves and even  courts disgust and hatred. No decencies restrained him: his spite was  implacable: his skill in finding out the vulnerable parts of strong  minds was consummate. All his great contemporaries felt his sting in  their turns. Once it inflicted a wound which deranged even the stern  composure of William, and constrained him to utter a wish that he were a  private gentleman, and could invite Mr. Howe to a short interview  behind Montague House. As yet, however, Howe was reckoned among the  most strenuous supporters of the new government, and directed all his  sarcasms and invectives against the malcontents. [30]    The subordinate places in every public office were divided between the  two parties: but the Whigs had the larger share. Some persons, indeed,  who did little honour to the Whig name, were largely recompensed for  services which no good man would have performed. Wildman was made  Postmaster General. A lucrative sinecure in the Excise was bestowed on  Ferguson. The duties of the Solicitor of the Treasury were both very  important and very invidious. It was the business of that officer to  conduct political prosecutions, to collect the evidence, to instruct the  counsel for the Crown, to see that the prisoners were not liberated on  insufficient bail, to see that the juries were not composed of persons  hostile to the government. In the days of Charles and James, the  Solicitors of the Treasury had been with too much reason accused of  employing all the vilest artifices of chicanery against men obnoxious  to the Court. The new government ought to have made a choice which was  above all suspicion. Unfortunately Mordaunt and Delamere pitched upon  Aaron Smith, an acrimonious and unprincipled politician, who had been  the legal adviser of Titus Oates in the days of the Popish Plot, and who  had been deeply implicated in the Rye House Plot. Richard Hampden, a  man of decided opinions but of moderate temper, objected to this  appointment. His objections however were overruled.

It  was a serious aggravation of his guilt that he had been one of the very  first persons who took the oaths to William and Mary. He was arrested  and brought to the Council Chamber. A narrative of what passed there,  written by himself, has been preserved. In that narrative he admits that  he was treated with great courtesy and delicacy. He vehemently asserted  his innocence. He declared that he had never corresponded with Saint  Germains, that he was no favourite there, and that Mary of Modena in  particular owed him a grudge. \"My Lords,\" he said, \"I am an Englishman.  I always, when the interest of the House of Bourbon was strongest here,  shunned the French, both men and women. I would lose the last drop of  my blood rather than see Portsmouth in the power of foreigners. I am not  such a fool as to think that King Lewis will conquer us merely for the  benefit of King James. I am certain that nothing can be truly imputed  to me beyond some foolish talk over a bottle.\" His protestations seem  to have produced some effect; for he was at first permitted to remain in  the gentle custody of the Black Rod. On further inquiry, however, it was  determined to send him to the Tower. After a confinement of a few weeks  he died of apoplexy; but he lived long enough to complete his disgrace  by offering his sword to the new government, and by expressing in  fervent language his hope that he might, by the goodness of God and of  Their Majesties, have an opportunity of showing how much he hated the  French. [20]    Turner ran no serious risk; for the government was most unwilling to  send to the scaffold one of the Seven who had signed the memorable  petition. A warrant was however issued for his apprehension; and his  friends had little hope that he would escape; for his nose was such as  none who had seen it could forget; and it was to little purpose that he  put on a flowing wig and that he suffered his beard to grow. The pursuit  was probably not very hot; for, after skulking a few weeks in England,  he succeeded in crossing the Channel, and remained some time in France.  [21]    A warrant was issued against Penn; and he narrowly escaped the  messengers. It chanced that, on the day on which they were sent in  search of him, he was attending a remarkable ceremony at some distance  from his home. An event had taken place which a historian, whose object  is to record the real life of a nation, ought not to pass unnoticed.  While London was agitated by the news that a plot had been discovered,  George Fox, the founder of the sect of Quakers, died.    More than forty years had elapsed since Fox had begun to see visions and  to cast out devils. [22] He was then a youth of pure morals and grave  deportment, with a perverse temper, with the education of a labouring  man, and with an intellect in the most unhappy of all states, that is  to say, too much disordered for liberty, and not sufficiently disordered  for Bedlam. The circumstances in which he was placed were such as could  scarcely fail to bring out in the strongest form the constitutional  diseases of his mind. At the time when his faculties were ripening,  Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, were striving for  mastery, and were, in every corner of the realm, refuting and reviling  each other. He wandered from congregation to congregation; he heard  priests harangue against Puritans; he heard Puritans harangue against  priests; and he in vain applied for spiritual direction and consolation  to doctors of both parties. One jolly old clergyman of the Anglican  communion told him to smoke tobacco and sing psalms; another advised  him to go and lose some blood. [23] The young inquirer turned in disgust  from these advisers to the Dissenters, and found them also blind guides.  [24] After some time he came to the conclusion that no human being was  competent to instruct him in divine things, and that the truth had been  communicated to him by direct inspiration from heaven. He argued that,  as the division of languages began at Babel, and as the persecutors of  Christ put on the cross an inscription in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, the  knowledge of languages, and more especially of Latin, Greek and Hebrew,  must be useless to a Christian minister. [25] Indeed, he was so far  from knowing many languages, that he knew none; nor can the most corrupt  passage in Hebrew be more unintelligible to the unlearned than his  English often is to the most acute and attentive reader. [26] One of the  precious truths which were divinely revealed to this new apostle was,  that it was falsehood and adulation to use the second person plural  instead of the second person singular. Another was, that to talk of the  month of March was to worship the bloodthirsty god Mars, and that to  talk of Monday was to pay idolatrous homage to the moon. To say Good  morning or Good evening was highly reprehensible, for those phrases  evidently imported that God had made bad days and bad nights. [27] A  Christian was bound to face death itself rather than touch his hat  to the greatest of mankind. When Fox was challenged to produce any  Scriptural authority for this dogma, he cited the passage in which it is  written that Shadrach, Meshech and Abednego were thrown into the fiery  furnace with their hats on; and, if his own narrative may be trusted,  the Chief Justice of England was altogether unable to answer this  argument except by crying out, \"Take him away, gaoler.\" [28] Fox  insisted much on the not less weighty argument that the Turks never show  their bare heads to their superiors; and he asked, with great animation,  whether those who bore the noble name of Christians ought not to surpass  Turks in virtue. [29] Bowing he strictly prohibited, and, indeed,  seemed to consider it as the effect of Satanical influence; for, as he  observed, the woman in the Gospel, while she had a spirit of infirmity,  was bowed together, and ceased to bow as soon as Divine power had  liberated her from the tyranny of the Evil One. [30] His expositions of  the sacred writings were of a very peculiar kind. Passages, which had  been, in the apprehension of all the readers of the Gospels during  sixteen centuries, figurative, he construed literally. Passages, which  no human being before him had ever understood in any other than a  literal sense, he construed figuratively. Thus, from those rhetorical  expressions in which the duty of patience under injuries is enjoined he  deduced the doctrine that selfdefence against pirates and assassins is  unlawful. On the other hand, the plain commands to baptize with water,  and to partake of bread and wine in commemoration of the redemption of  mankind, he pronounced to be allegorical. He long wandered from place to  place, teaching this strange theology, shaking like an aspen leaf in his  paroxysms of fanatical excitement, forcing his way into churches,  which he nicknamed steeple houses interrupting prayers and sermons with  clamour and scurrility, [31] and pestering rectors and justices with  epistles much resembling burlesques of those sublime odes in which the  Hebrew prophets foretold the calamities of Babylon and Tyre. [32] He  soon acquired great notoriety by these feats. His strange face, his  strange chant, his immovable hat and his leather breeches were known all  over the country; and he boasts that, as soon as the rumour was heard,  \"The Man in Leather Breeches is coming,\" terror seized hypocritical  professors, and hireling priests made haste to get out of his way. [33]  He was repeatedly imprisoned and set in the stocks, sometimes justly,  for disturbing the public worship of congregations, and sometimes  unjustly, for merely talking nonsense. He soon gathered round him a body  of disciples, some of whom went beyond himself in absurdity. He has told  us that one of his friends walked naked through Skipton declaring the  truth. [34] and that another was divinely moved to go naked during  several years to marketplaces, and to the houses of gentlemen and  clergymen. [35] Fox complains bitterly that these pious acts, prompted  by the Holy Spirit, were requited by an untoward generation with  hooting, pelting, coachwhipping and horsewhipping. But, though he  applauded the zeal of the sufferers, he did not go quite to their  lengths. He sometimes, indeed, was impelled to strip himself partially.  Thus he pulled off his shoes and walked barefoot through Lichfield,  crying, \"Woe to the bloody city.\" [36] But it does not appear that he  ever thought it his duty to appear before the public without that decent  garment from which his popular appellation was derived.    If we form our judgment of George Fox simply by looking at his own  actions and writings, we shall see no reason for placing him, morally  or intellectually, above Ludowick Muggleton or Joanna Southcote. But it  would be most unjust to rank the sect which regards him as its founder  with the Muggletonians or the Southcotians. It chanced that among  the thousands whom his enthusiasm infected were a few persons whose  abilities and attainments were of a very different order from his own.  Robert Barclay was a man of considerable parts and learning. William  Penn, though inferior to Barclay in both natural and acquired abilities,  was a gentleman and a scholar. That such men should have become the  followers of George Fox ought not to astonish any person who remembers  what quick, vigorous and highly cultivated intellects were in our own  times duped by the unknown tongues. The truth is that no powers of mind  constitute a security against errors of this description. Touching God  and His ways with man, the highest human faculties can discover little  more than the meanest. In theology the interval is small indeed between  Aristotle and a child,"]]]
