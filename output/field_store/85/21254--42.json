[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#6)"],[1,"ted. It reminds me of  the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in  the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It  has all been done before.\"    As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,  feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same  far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was  the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness  with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips,  and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.    \"He has not been moved at all?\" he asked.    \"No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\"    \"You can take him to the mortuary now,\" he said. \"There is nothing more  to be learned.\"    Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered  the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised  him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed  it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.    \"There's been a woman here,\" he cried. \"It's a woman's wedding-ring.\"    He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered  round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of  plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.    \"This complicates matters,\" said Gregson. \"Heaven knows, they were  complicated enough before.\"    \"You're sure it doesn't simplify them?\" observed Holmes. \"There's  nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his  pockets?\"    \"We have it all here,\" said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects  upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \"A gold watch, No. 97163, by  Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,  with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes.  Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,  corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose  money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of  Boccaccio's 'Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the  fly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph  Stangerson.\"    \"At what address?\"    \"American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both  from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their  boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to  return to New York.\"    \"Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\"    \"I did it at once, sir,\" said Gregson. \"I have had advertisements  sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American  Exchange, but he has not returned yet.\"    \"Have you sent to Cleveland?\"    \"We telegraphed this morning.\"    \"How did you word your inquiries?\"    \"We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad  of any information which could help us.\"    \"You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to  be crucial?\"    \"I asked about Stangerson.\"    \"Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears  to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\"    \"I have said all I have to say,\" said Gregson, in an offended voice.    Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make  some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we  were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,  rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.    \"Mr. Gregson,\" he said, \"I have just made a discovery of the highest  importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a  careful examination of the walls.\"    The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in  a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his  colleague.    \"Come here,\" he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of  which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \"Now, stand  there!\"    He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.    \"Look at that!\" he said, triumphantly.    I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this  particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a  yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was  scrawled in blood-red letters a single word--                             RACHE.      \"What do you think of that?\" cried the detective, with the air of a  showman exhibiting his show. \"This was overlooked because it was in the  darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The  murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where  it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide  anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See  that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was  lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of  the wall.\"    \"And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\" asked Gregson in a  depreciatory voice.    \"Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name  Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark  my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a  woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It's all very well for  you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but  the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\"    \"I really beg your pardon!\" said my companion, who had ruffled the  little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \"You  certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,  and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other  participant in last night's mystery. I have not had time to examine this  room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\"    As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying  glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly  about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once  lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that  he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to  himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire  of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of  encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded  of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and  forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes  across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his  researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between  marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his  tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place  he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,  and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass  the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most  minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he  replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.    \"They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" he  remarked with a smile. \"It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to  detective work.\"    Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur  companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently  failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that  Sherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some  definite and practical end.    \"What do you think of it, sir?\" they both asked.    \"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume  to help you,\" remarked my friend. \"You are doing so well now that it  would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\" There was a world of  sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \"If you will let me know how your  investigations go,\" he continued, \"I shall be happy to give you any help  I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found  the body. Can you give me his name and address?\"    Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \"John Rance,\" he said. \"He is off  duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\"    Holmes took a note of the address.    \"Come along, Doctor,\" he said; \"we shall go and look him up. I'll tell  you one thing which may help you in the case,\" he continued, turning to  the two detectives. \"There has been murder done, and the murderer was a  man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had  small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a  Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,  which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his  off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the  finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a  few indications, but they may assist you.\"    Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.    \"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\" asked the former.    \"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \"One other thing,  Lestrade,\" he added, turning round at the door: \"'Rache,' is the German  for 'revenge;' so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\"    With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals  open-mouthed behind him.          CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.      IT was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock  Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a  long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us  to the address given us by Lestrade.    \"There is nothing like first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24407"],[0,"The Italian Cook Book (#6)"],[1,"tasting.      59    BALSAMELLA SAUCE    (Salsa balsamella)    This sauce resembles the famous French Bechamel Sauce, but it is simpler  in its composition.    Put in a saucepan one tablespoonful of flour and a piece of butter as  big as an egg. Stir the flour and the butter together while keeping them  over the fire. When the flour begins to be browned, pour over a pint of  milk, continually stirring with a wooden spoon until you see the liquid  condensed like a cream. This is the =Balsamella=. If it is too thick add  some milk, if too liquid put back on the fire with another piece of  butter dipped in flour.    A good =Balsamella= and some well prepared brown stock are the base and  the principal secret of many savory dishes.      60    CURLED OMELET    (Frittata in riccioli)    Boil a bunch of spinach and rub it through a sieve. Beat two eggs,  season with salt and pepper and mix with them enough spinach to make the  eggs appear green. Put the frying pan on the fire with only enough oil  to grease it and when very hot put in a portion of the eggs, moving the  frying pan so as to make a very thin omelet. When well cooked, remove it  from the frying pan and repeat the operation once or twice in order to  have two or three very thin omelets. Put these one over the other and  cut them in small strips that are to be browned in butter adding a  little grated cheese. These strips of omelet, resembling noodles, form a  tasty and attractive dressing for a fricandeau (veal stew) or a similar  dish.      61    VEAL KIDNEY OMELET    (Frittata di rognone di vitella)    Take a veal kidney, open it lengthwise and leave all its fat. Season  with oil, salt and pepper, broil it and cut in thin slices. Beat enough  eggs in proportion to the size of the kidney, season them with salt and  pepper, both in moderate quantity and mix with them a sprig of parsley  and some grated cheese. Put the sliced kidney in the eggs, mix all  together and make an omelet with some butter.      62    PUFF PASTE    (Pasta sfoglia)    The =Pasta sfoglia= is not too difficult to make and if the following  instructions are carefully followed, this fine and light paste can  easily be prepared. It is well to have a marble slab to roll it on but  this is not absolutely necessary. A warm, damp day is not favorable for  the making of the =Pasta sfoglia=, which succeeds better when the  weather is cold and dry.    Mix half a pound of flour of the very best quality with a piece of  butter as big as a walnut, some warm, but not hot water, enough salt and  a teaspoonful of good brandy. When the paste is formed knead it well for  about half an hour, first with the hands, then throwing it repeatedly  with force against the bread board. Make a cake of a rectangular form,  wrap it in cloth and let it rest for a while. Meanwhile work with the  hand 1/2 lb. of butter that has been kept previously on ice or, better,  in a bowl of ice-water, until it becomes smooth and flexible, then make  of it a little cake like that of the paste and throw it in a bowl of  cold water. When the dough has rested take the butter from the water,  wipe it with a cloth and dip it in flour.    Roll the paste only as long as it is necessary to enclose within the  cake of butter. This is placed in the middle and the edges of the sheet  of paste are drawn over it, closing well with fingers moistened in a  little water so that no air remains inside. Then begin to flatten, first  with the hands, then with the rolling pin, making the sheet as thin as  possible, but taking care that the butter does not come out. If this  happens throw at once a little flour where the butter appears and always  have the marble slab (or bread board) and the rolling pin sprinkled with  flour. Fold it over, making three even layers of paste, and again roll  the folded strip, repeating the operation six times and letting the  paste rest from time to time for a few minutes. At the last time, fold  it in two and reduce it to the necessary thickness that is, about one  third of an inch. After each folding press the edges gently with the  rolling pin to shut in the air, and turn the paste so as to roll in a  different direction.    When the paste has had six turns cut it into the desired forms and put  on ice, or in a cold place for twenty to thirty minutes before putting  it on the oven, which must be very hot, with the greatest heat at the  bottom.    The puff paste is used for pate shells and vol-au-vent cake and for  light pastries of all kinds.      63    PASTE FOR FRYING    (Pastella per fritto)    Dilute three teaspoonfuls of flour with two teaspoonfuls of oil. Add two  eggs, a pinch of salt, and mix well. This mixture will take on the  aspect of a smooth cream and is used to glaze fried brains, sweetbreads  and the like. All these things are first to be scalded in boiling salt  water. Add a pinch of salt and one of pepper when taking from the water.  The brains, sweetbreads etc. are then to be cut in irregular pieces,  thrown into the paste, or cream, described above and fried in oil or  good lard.    In frying these are often united to liver or veal cutlets. The liver  must be cut in very thin slices and the cutlets beaten with the side of  a big knife and given a good shape. Season with salt and pepper, dip in  beaten egg and after a few hours sprinkle with bread crumbs and fry.  Serve with lemon.      64    CHICKEN STUFFING    (Ripieno di pollo)    The ingredients are 1/4 lb. lean veal or pork or breast of turkey and  chicken giblets. Cook this meat together with a little hash of onion,  parsley, celery, carrot and butter. Season with salt pepper and spices,  moistening it with broth. Take dry from the fire, take off the soft  parts of the giblets, add a few dry mushrooms softened in water, a  little slice of lean fat ham and chop everything fine. Into the sauce  that has remained from the cooking throw enough breadcrumbs to make a  tablespoonful of hard soaked bread. Mix it with the chopped hash, add a  pinch of grated cheese and two eggs and fill the chicken with all this,  sewing up the opening afterwards. The chicken can be boiled or stewed.  If boiled you will have an excellent bouillon, but pay attention when  cutting the chicken to extract the stuffing in one piece in order to  slice it.      65    MEAT STUFFING FOR VOL-AU-VENT    (Ripieno di carne per pasticcini di pasta sfoglia)    This stuffing can be made either with stewed veal or chicken giblets or  sweetbreads. The latter are preferable, being more delicate and a taste  of truffles greatly improves the stuffing. If sweetbreads are used, put  them on the fire with a piece of butter and season with salt and pepper.  When they have begun to take color, complete the cooking with some brown  stock, then cut them in pieces as little as a bean. Add one or two  spoons of =Balsamella= (see No. 54) a little tongue, one or two slices  of ham cut in little squares, a pinch of grated cheese and a taste of  nutmeg, seeing that the ingredients are in such quantities as to make  the mixture tasty and delicate. Leave it cool well, as in this way it  hardens and can be worked better.    In order to enclose it in pate shells made with puff-paste (see No. 57)  there are two ways. One is to cook the shells filled with the stuffing,  the other to fill them after they are cooked. In the first case put the  stuffing in the prepared disk of paste, moisten the edge with a wet  finger, cover with another disk of paste and cook. In the second case,  which is more convenient because the shells can be prepared one day  before, the two disks are put together without the stuffing, but in the  upper disk a circular cut must be made as large as a half dollar coin.  The pate on cooking swells and leaves an empty space in the interior.  Lifting with the point of a knife the little circle above, which has the  form of a cover, the interior space can be made larger, filled with the  stuffing and covered with the little cover. In this way it is enough to  warm them before sending to the table. The puff-paste must always be  glazed with the yolk of eggs.    If a large vol-au-vent is to be filled instead of little pate-shells, a  ragout of chicken giblets and sweetbread, cut in large pieces, is  better.      66    PORK LIVER FRIED    (Fegato di maiale fritto)    Cut in to thin slices some pork liver, sprinkle with flour and fry in  good lard. It must be served with its sauce. Squeeze in a lemon while it  is frying.      67    FRIED CROQUETTES, BOLOGNA STYLE    (Fritto composto alla Bolognese)    Take a piece of stewed lean veal, a little brain boiled or stewed, and a  slice of ham. Chop and grind everything fine. Add a yolk of egg or a  whole egg, according to the quantity, and a little =Balsamella= (see No.  54). Put the hash on the fire and stir until the egg is cooked. Add  finally grated cheese, a taste of nutmeg, and, if you have them, some  truffles chopped very fine and put in a plate. When quite cold make some  little balls as large as a walnut and roll them in flour. Then dip in  beaten egg and bread crumb ground very fine, repeating the operation  twice, and fry.      68    ROMAN FRY    (Fritto alla Romana)    I.    Put on the fire a hash of onion and butter and when it is well browned  cook in it a piece of lean veal seasoned with salt and pepper. When the  meat begins to brown put in a little sherry wine to complete the  cooking.    Pound the whole to soften it a little using the sauce remained and if  this is not enough add some broth and finally the yolk of an egg. See  that the whole is not softened too much.    Now take some wafers, not too thin and cut them in squares similar to  those used by druggists. Beat one egg and the white from the other egg,  then take a wafer, dip it in the egg and place it on a layer of bread  crumbs ground fine. On the wafer put a little ball of the compound  above, then dip another wafer in the egg, make it touch the bread crumbs  only"]]]
