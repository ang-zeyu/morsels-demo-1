[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2447"],[0,"Eminent Victorians (#6)"],[1,"was to prove that there was nothing in the  Thirty-nine Articles incompatible with the creed of the Roman Church.  Newman pointed out, for instance, that it was generally supposed that  the Articles condemned the doctrine of Purgatory; but they did not; they  merely condemned the Romish doctrine of Purgatory--and Romish, clearly,  was not the same thing as Roman. Hence it followed that believers in the  Roman doctrine of Purgatory might subscribe the Articles with a good  conscience. Similarly, the Articles condemned 'the sacrifices of  masses', but they did not condemn 'the sacrifice of the Mass'. Thus, the  Mass might be lawfully celebrated in English Churches. Newman took the  trouble to examine the Articles in detail from this point of view, and  the conclusion he came to in every case supported his contention in a  singular manner.    The Tract produced an immense sensation, for it seemed to be a deadly  and treacherous blow aimed at the very heart of the Church of England.  Deadly it certainly was, but it was not so treacherous as it appeared at  first sight. The members of the English Church had ingenuously imagined  up to that moment that it was possible to contain, in a frame of words,  the subtle essence of their complicated doctrinal system, involving the  mysteries of the Eternal and the Infinite on the one hand, and the  elaborate adjustments of temporal government on the other. They did not  understand that verbal definitions in such a case will only perform  their functions so long as there is no dispute about the matters which  they are intended to define: that is to say, so long as there is no need  for them. For generations this had been the case with the Thirty-nine  Articles. Their drift was clear enough; and nobody bothered over their  exact meaning. But directly someone found it important to give them a  new and untraditional interpretation, it appeared that they were a mass  of ambiguity, and might be twisted into meaning very nearly anything  that anybody liked. Steady-going churchmen were appalled and outraged  when they saw Newman, in Tract No. 90, performing this operation. But,  after all, he was only taking the Church of England at its word. And  indeed, since Newman showed the way, the operation has become so  exceedingly common that the most steady-going churchman hardly raises an  eyebrow at it now.    At the time, however, Newman's treatment of the Articles seemed to  display not only a perverted supersubtlety of intellect, but a temper of  mind that was fundamentally dishonest. It was then that he first began  to be assailed by those charges of untruthfulness which reached their  culmination more than twenty years later in the celebrated controversy  with Charles Kingsley, which led to the writing of the Apologia. The  controversy was not a very fruitful one, chiefly because Kingsley could  no more understand the nature of Newman's intelligence than a subaltern  in a line regiment can understand a Brahmin of Benares. Kingsley was a  stout Protestant, whose hatred of Popery was, at bottom, simply  ethical--an honest, instinctive horror of the practices of priestcraft  and the habits of superstition; and it was only natural that he should  see in those innumerable delicate distinctions which Newman was  perpetually drawing, and which he himself had not only never thought of,  but could not even grasp, simply another manifestation of the inherent  falsehood of Rome. But, in reality, no one, in one sense of the word,  was more truthful than Newman. The idea of deceit would have been  abhorrent to him; and indeed it was owing to his very desire to explain  what he had in his mind exactly and completely, with all the refinements  of which his subtle brain was capable, that persons such as Kingsley  were puzzled into thinking him dishonest. Unfortunately, however, the  possibilities of truth and falsehood depend upon other things besides  sincerity. A man may be of a scrupulous and impeccable honesty, and yet  his respect for the truth--it cannot be denied--may be insufficient. He  may be, like the lunatic, the lover, and the poet, 'of imagination all  compact'; he may be blessed, or cursed, with one of those 'seething  brains', one of those 'shaping fanatasies' that 'apprehend more than  cool reason ever comprehends'; he may be by nature incapable of sifting  evidence, or by predilection simply indisposed to do so. 'When we were  there,' wrote Newman in a letter to a friend after his conversion,  describing a visit to Naples, and the miraculous circumstances connected  with the liquefaction of St. Januarius's blood,    'the feast of St. Gennaro was coming on, and the Jesuits were eager for  us to stop--they have the utmost confidence in the miracle--and were the  more eager because many Catholics, till they have seen it, doubt it. Our  father director here tells us that before he went to Naples he did not  believe it. That is, they have vague ideas of natural means,  exaggeration, etc., not of course imputing fraud. They say conversions  often take place in consequence. It is exposed for the Octave, and the  miracle continues--it is not simple liquefaction, but sometimes it  swells, sometimes boils, sometimes melts--no one can tell what is going  to take place. They say it is quite overcoming-and people cannot help  crying to see it. I understand that Sir H. Davy attended everyday, and  it was this extreme variety of the phenomenon which convinced him that  nothing physical would account for it. Yet there is this remarkable fact  that liquefactions of blood are common at Naples--and, unless it is  irreverent to the Great Author of Miracles to be obstinate in the  inquiry, the question certainly rises whether there is something in the  air. (Mind, I don't believe there is--and, speaking humbly, and without  having seen it, think it a true miracle--but I am arguing.) We saw the  blood of St Patrizia, half liquid; i.e. liquefying, on her feast day. St  John Baptist's blood sometimes liquefies on the 29th of August, and did  when we were at Naples, but we had not time to go to the church. We saw  the liquid blood of an Oratorian Father; a good man, but not a saint,  who died two centuries ago, I think; and we saw the liquid blood of Da  Ponte, the great and holy Jesuit, who, I suppose, was almost a saint.  But these instances do not account for liquefaction on certain days, if  this is the case. But the most strange phenomenon is what happens at  Ravello, a village or town above Amalfi. There is the blood of St.  Pantaleon. It is in a vessel amid the stonework of the Altar-it is not  touched but on his feast in June it liquefies. And more, there is an  excommunication against those who bring portions of the True Cross into  the Church. Why? Because the blood liquefies, whenever it is brought. A  person I know, not knowing the prohibition, brought in a portion, and  the Priest suddenly said, who showed the blood, \"Who has got the Holy  Cross about him?\" I tell you what was told me by a grave and religious  man. It is a curious coincidence that in telling this to our Father  Director here, he said, \"Why, we have a portion of St. Pantaleon's blood  at the Chiesa Nuova, and it is always liquid.\"'    After leaving Naples, Newman visited Loreto, and inspected the house of  the Holy Family, which, as is known to the faithful, was transported  thither, in three hops, from Palestine.    'I went to Loreto,' he wrote, 'with a simple faith, believing what I  still more believed when I saw it. I have no doubt now. If you ask me  why I believe it, it is because everyone believes it at Rome; cautious  as they are and sceptical about some other things. I have no antecedent  difficulty in the matter. He who floated the Ark on the surges of a  world-wide sea, and enclosed in it all living things, who has hidden the  terrestrial paradise, who said that faith might move mountains, who  sustained thousands for forty years in a sterile wilderness, who  transported Elias and keeps him hidden till the end, could do this  wonder also.'    Here, whatever else there may be, there is certainly no trace of a  desire to deceive. Could a state of mind, in fact, be revealed with more  absolute transparency?    When Newman was a child he 'wished that he could believe the Arabian  Nights were true'. When he came to be a man, his wish seems to have been  granted.    Tract No. 90 was officially condemned by the authorities at Oxford, and  in the hubbub that followed, the contending parties closed their ranks;  henceforward, any compromise between the friends and the enemies of the  Movement was impossible. Archdeacon Manning was in too conspicuous a  position to be able to remain silent; he was obliged to declare himself,  and he did not hesitate. In an archidiaconal charge, delivered within a  few months of his appointment, he firmly repudiated the Tractarians. But  the repudiation was not deemed sufficient, and a year later he repeated  it with greater emphasis. Still, however, the horrid rumours were  afloat. The \"Record\" began to investigate matters, and its vigilance was  soon rewarded by an alarming discovery: the sacrament had been  administered in Chichester Cathedral on a weekday, and 'Archdeacon  Manning, one of the most noted and determined of the Tractarians, had  acted a conspicuous part on the occasion'. It was clear that the only  way of silencing these malevolent whispers was by some public  demonstration whose import nobody could doubt. The annual sermon  preached on Guy Fawkes Day before the University of Oxford seemed to  offer the very opportunity that Manning required. He seized it; got  himself appointed preacher; and delivered from the pulpit of St. Mary's  a virulently Protestant harangue. This time there could indeed be no  doubt about the matter: Manning had shouted 'No Popery!' in the very  citadel of the Movement, and every one, including Newman, recognised  that he had finally cut"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#6)"],[1,"that, so far as the usual maritime contracts are  concerned, the dealing must be on the security of the ship or  merchandise in many cases, and therefore [33] that it is policy  to give this security in all cases; that the risk to which it  subjects ship-owners is calculable, and that they must take it  into account when they let their vessels. Again, in many cases,  when a party asserts a maritime lien by way of contract, he has  improved the condition of the thing upon which the lien is  claimed, and this has been recognized as a ground for such a lien  in some systems. But this is not true universally, nor in the  most important cases. It must be left to the reader to decide  whether ground has not been shown for believing that the same  metaphysical confusion which naturally arose as to the ship's  wrongful acts, affected the way of thinking as to her contracts.  The whole manner of dealing with vessels obviously took the form  which prevailed in the eases first mentioned. Pardessus, a high  authority, says that the lien for freight prevails even against  the owner of stolen goods, \"as the master deals less with the  person than the thing.\" /2/ So it was said in the argument of a  famous English case, that \"the ship is instead of the owner, and  therefore is answerable.\" /3/ In many cases of contract, as well  as tort, the vessel was not only the security for the debt, but  the limit of the owner's liability.    The principles of the admiralty are embodied in its form of  procedure. A suit may be brought there against a vessel by name,  any person interested in it being at liberty to come in and  defend, but the suit, if successful, ending in a sale of the  vessel and a payment of the plaintiff's claim out of the  proceeds. As long ago as the time of James I. it was said that  \"the libel ought to be only [34] against the ship and goods, and  not against the party.\" /1/ And authority for the statement was  cited from the reign of Henry VI., the same reign when, as we  have seen, the Admiral claimed a forfeiture of ships for causing  death. I am bound to say, however, that I cannot find such an  authority of that date.    We have now followed the development of the chief forms of  liability in modern law for anything other than the immediate and  manifest consequences of a man's own acts. We have seen the  parallel course of events in the two parents,--the Roman law and  the German customs, and in the offspring of those two on English  soil with regard to servants, animals, and inanimate things. We  have seen a single germ multiplying and branching into products  as different from each other as the flower from the root. It  hardly remains to ask what that germ was. We have seen that it  was the desire of retaliation against the offending thing itself.  Undoubtedly, it might be argued that many of the rules stated  were derived from a seizure of the offending thing as security  for reparation, at first, perhaps, outside the law. That  explanation, as well as the one offered here; would show that  modern views of responsibility had not yet been attained, as the  owner of the thing might very well not have been the person in  fault. But such has not been the view of those most competent to  judge. A consideration of the earliest instances will show, as  might have been expected, that vengeance, not compensation, and  vengeance on the offending thing, was the original object. The ox  in Exodus was to be stoned. The axe in the Athenian law was to be  banished. The tree, in Mr. Tylor's instance, was to be chopped to  pieces. The [35] slave under all the systems was to be  surrendered to the relatives of the slain man, that they might do  with him what they liked. /1/ The deodand was an accursed thing.  The original limitation of liability to surrender, when the owner  was before the court, could not be accounted for if it was his  liability, and not that of his property, which was in question.  Even where, as in some of the cases, expiation seems to be  intended rather than vengeance, the object is equally remote from  an extrajudicial distress.    The foregoing history, apart from the purposes for which it has  been given, well illustrates the paradox of form and substance in  the development of law. In form its growth is logical. The  official theory is that each new decision follows syllogistically  from existing precedents. But just as the clavicle in the cat  only tells of the existence of some earlier creature to which a  collar-bone was useful, precedents survive in the law long after  the use they once served is at an end and the reason for them has  been forgotten. The result of following them must often be  failure and confusion from the merely logical point of view.    On the other hand, in substance the growth of the law is  legislative. And this in a deeper sense than that what the courts  declare to have always been the law is in fact new. It is  legislative in its grounds. The very considerations which judges  most rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the secret  root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of  course, considerations of what is expedient for the community  concerned. Every important principle which is developed by  litigation is in fact and at bottom the result of more or less  definitely understood views of public policy; most generally, to  be sure, [36] under our practice and traditions, the unconscious  result of instinctive preferences and inarticulate convictions,  but none the less traceable to views of public policy in the last  analysis. And as the law is administered by able and experienced  men, who know too much to sacrifice good sense to a syllogism, it  will be found that, when ancient rules maintain themselves in the  way that has been and will be shown in this book, new reasons  more fitted to the time have been found for them, and that they  gradually receive a new content, and at last a new form, from the  grounds to which they have been transplanted.    But hitherto this process has been largely unconscious. It is  important, on that account, to bring to mind what the actual  course of events has been. If it were only to insist on a more  conscious recognition of the legislative function of the courts,  as just explained, it would be useful, as we shall see more  clearly further on. /1/    What has been said will explain the failure of all theories which  consider the law only from its formal side; whether they attempt  to deduce the corpus from a priori postulates, or fall into the  humbler error of supposing the science of the law to reside in  the elegantia juris, or logical cohesion of part with part. The  truth is, that the law always approaching, and never reaching,  consistency. It is forever adopting new principles from life at  one end, and it always retains old ones from history at the  other, which have not yet been absorbed or sloughed off. It  will become entirely consistent only when it ceases to grow.    The study upon which we have been engaged is necessary both for  the knowledge and for the revision of the law. [37] However much  we may codify the law into a series of seemingly self-sufficient  propositions, those propositions will be but a phase in a  continuous growth. To understand their scope fully, to know how  they will be dealt with by judges trained in the past which the  law embodies, we must ourselves know something of that past. The  history of what the law has been is necessary to the knowledge of  what the law is.    Again, the process which I have described has involved the  attempt to follow precedents, as well as to give a good reason  for them. When we find that in large and important branches of  the law the various grounds of policy on which the various rules  have been justified are later inventions to account for what are  in fact survivals from more primitive times, we have a right to  reconsider the popular reasons, and, taking a broader view of the  field, to decide anew whether those reasons are satisfactory.  They may be, notwithstanding the manner of their appearance. If  truth were not often suggested by error, if old implements could  not be adjusted to new uses, human progress would be slow. But  scrutiny and revision are justified.    But none of the foregoing considerations, nor the purpose of  showing the materials for anthropology contained in the history  of the law, are the immediate object here. My aim and purpose  have been to show that the various forms of liability known to  modern law spring from the common ground of revenge. In the  sphere of contract the fact will hardly be material outside the  cases which have been stated in this Lecture. But in the criminal  law and the law of torts it is of the first importance. It shows  that they have started from a moral basis, from the thought that  some one was to blame.    [38] It remains to be proved that, while the terminology of  morals is still retained, and while the law does still and  always, in a certain sense, measure legal liability by moral  standards, it nevertheless, by the very necessity of its nature,  is continually transmuting those moral standards into external or  objective ones, from which the actual guilt of the party  concerned is wholly eliminated.      [39]          LECTURE II. -- THE CRIMINAL LAW.    In the beginning of the first Lecture it was shown that the  appeals of the early law were directed only to intentional  wrongs. The appeal was a far older form of procedure than the  indictment, and may be said to have had a criminal as well as a  civil aspect. It had the double object of satisfying the private  party for his loss, and the king for the breach of his peace. On  its civil side it was rooted in vengeance. It was a proceeding to  recover those compositions, at first optional, afterwards  compulsory, by which a wrong-doer bought the spear from his side.  Whether, so far as concerned the king, it"]]]
