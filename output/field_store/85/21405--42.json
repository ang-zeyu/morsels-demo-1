Ralph, the  historian and political writer, whose histories and politics are now as  little read as the Dunciad which held them up to ridicule, is buried  here; and confined as is the space, it is rich in epitaphs,--three are  from the pen of David Garrick, two from that of Arthur Murphy.    Hogarth's monument has been very faithfully copied by Mr. Fairholt.    It is remarkable among the many plainer \"stones\" with which the  churchyard is crowded, but is by no means distinguished for that  artistic character--which it might have received as covering the remains  of so great an artist. A small slab, in relief, takes from it, however,  the charge of insipidity; it contains a comic mask, an oak branch,  pencils and mahl-stick, a book and a scroll, and the palette, marked  with the \"line of beauty.\"    It has been remarked, that \"while he faithfully followed nature through  all her varieties, and exposed, with inimitable skill, the infinite  follies and vices of the world, he was in himself an example of many  virtues.\" And the following poetical tribute by David Garrick is  inscribed on the tomb:        \"Farewell! great painter of mankind,        Who reached the noblest point of Art;      Whose pictured morals charm the mind,        And through the eye correct the heart      If Genius fire thee, reader, stay;        If Nature touch thee, drop a tear;      If neither move thee, turn away,        For Hogarth's honored dust lies here!\"    Dr. Johnson also composed an epitaph, which Cunningham considers \"more  to the purpose, but still unworthy:\"        \"The hand of him here torpid lies,        That drew the essential forms of grace;      Here closed in death the attentive eyes        That saw the manners in the face.\"    The tributes--in poetry and prose--are just, examine the works of this  great painter-teacher as closely and suspiciously as we may, we can  discover nothing that will induce a momentary doubt of his integrity of  purpose in all he did; his shafts were aimed at Vice,--in no solitary  instance was he ever guilty of arraigning or assailing Virtue. Compare  him with the most famous of the Dutch masters, and he rises into glory;  coarseness and vulgarity in them had no point out of which could come  instruction. If they picture the issues of their own minds, they must  have been gross and sensual; they ransacked the muck of life, and the  grovelling in character, for themes that one should see only by  compulsion. But Hogarth's subjects were never without a lesson, and,  inasmuch as he resorted for them to the open volume of humanity, like  those of the most immortal of our writers, his works are \"not for an age  but for all time.\"    [Illustration]          NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.    [Illustration]      The author of _The House of Seven Gables_ is now about forty-five years  of age. He was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and is of a family which  for several generations has \"followed the sea.\" Among his ancestors, I  believe, was the \"bold Hawthorne,\" who is celebrated in a revolutionary  ballad as commander of the \"Fair American.\" He was educated at Bowdoin  College in Maine, where he graduated in 1825.    Probably he appeared in print before that time, but his earliest volume  was an anonymous and never avowed romance which was published in Boston  in 1832. It attracted little attention, but among those who read it with  a just appreciation of the author's genius was Mr. S. G. Goodrich, who  immediately secured the shrouded star for _The Token_, of which he was  editor, and through which many of Hawthorne's finest tales and essays  were originally given to the public. He published in 1837 the first and  in 1842 the second volume of his _Twice-Told Tales_, embracing whatever  he wished to preserve from his contributions to the magazines; in 1845  he edited _The Journal of an African Cruiser_; in 1846 published _Mosses  from an Old Manse_, a second collection of his magazine papers; in 1850  _The Scarlet Letter_, and in the last month the longest and in some  respects the most remarkable of his works, _The House of Seven Gables_.    In the introductions to the _Mosses from an Old Manse_ and _The Scarlet  Letter_ we have some glimpses of his personal history. He had been  several years in the Custom-House at Boston, while Mr. Bancroft was  collector, and afterwards had joined that remarkable association, the  \"Brook Farm Community,\" at West Roxbury, where, with others, he appears  to have been reconciled to the old ways, as quite equal to the  inventions of Fourier, St. Simon, Owen, and the rest of that ingenious  company of schemers who have been so intent upon a reconstruction of the  foundations of society. In 1843, he went to reside in the pleasant  village of Concord, in the \"Old Manse,\" which had never been profaned by  a lay occupant until he entered it as his home. In the introduction to  _The Mosses_ he says:         \"A priest had built it; a priest had succeeded to it; other       priestly men, from time to time, had dwelt in it; and children,       born in its chambers, had grown up to assume the priestly       character. It was awful to reflect how many sermons must have       been written there. The latest inhabitant alone--he, by whose       translation to Paradise the dwelling was left vacant--had       penned nearly three thousand discourses, besides the better, if       not the greater number, that gushed living from his lips. How       often, no doubt, had he paced to and fro along the avenue,       attuning his meditations, to the sighs and gentle murmurs, and       deep and solemn peals of the wind, among the lofty tops of the       trees! In that variety of natural utterances, he could find       something accordant with every passage of his sermon, were it       of tenderness or reverential fear. The boughs over my head       seemed shadowy with solemn thoughts, as well as with rustling       leaves. I took shame to myself for having been so long a       writer of idle stories, and ventured to hope that wisdom would       descend upon me with the falling leaves of the avenue; and that       I should light upon an intellectual treasure, in the Old Manse,       well worth those hoards of long-hidden gold, which people seek       for in moss-grown houses. Profound treatises of morality--a       layman's unprofessional, and therefore unprejudiced views of       religion;--histories (such as Bancroft might have written, had       he taken up his abode here, as he once purposed), bright with       picture, gleaming over a depth of philosophic thought;--these       were the works that might fitly have flowed from such a       retirement. In the humblest event, I resolved at least to       achieve a novel, that should evolve some deep lesson, and       should possess physical substance enough to stand alone. In       furtherance of my design, and as if to leave me no pretext for       not fulfilling it, there was, in the rear of the house, the       most delightful little nook of a study that ever offered its       snug seclusion to a scholar. It was here that Emerson wrote       'Nature;' for he was then an inhabitant of the Manse, and used       to watch the Assyrian dawn and the Paphian sunset and moonrise,       from the summit of our eastern hill. When I first saw the room,       its walls were blackened with the smoke of unnumbered years,       and made still blacker by the grim prints of puritan ministers       that hung around. These worthies looked strangely like bad       angels, or, at least, like men who had wrestled so continually       and so sternly with the devil, that somewhat of his sooty       fierceness had been imparted to their own visages. They had all       vanished now; a cheerful coat of paint, and gold tinted paper       hangings, lighted up the small apartment; while the shadow of a       willow-tree, that swept against the overhanging eaves,       attempered the cheery western sunshine. In place of the grim       prints there was the sweet and lovely head of one of Raphael's       Madonnas, and two pleasant little pictures of the Lake of Como.       The only other decorations were a purple vase of flowers,       always fresh, and a bronze one containing graceful ferns. My       books (few, and by no means choice; for they were chiefly such       waifs as chance had thrown in my way) stood in order about the       room, seldom to be disturbed.\"    In his home at Concord, thus happily described, in the midst of a few  congenial friends, Hawthorne passed three years; and, \"in a spot so  sheltered from the turmoil of life's ocean,\" he says, \"three years  hasten away with a noiseless flight, as the breezy sunshine chases the  cloud-shadows across the depths of a still valley.\" But at length his  repose was invaded by that \"spirit of improvement,\" which is so  constantly marring the happiness of quiet-loving people, and he was  compelled to look out for another residence.         \"Now came hints, growing more and more distinct, that the owner       of the old house was pining for his native air. Carpenters next       appeared, making a tremendous racket among the outbuildings,       strewing green grass with pine shavings and chips of chesnut       joists, and vexing the whole antiquity of the place with their       discordant renovations. Soon, moreover, they divested our abode       of the veil of woodbine which had crept over a large portion of       its southern face. All the aged mosses were cleared unsparingly       away; and there were horrible whispers about brushing up the       external walls with a coat of paint--a purpose as little to my       taste as might be that of rouging the venerable cheeks of one's       grandmother. But the hand that renovates is always more       sacrilegious than that which destroys. In fine, we gathered up       our household goods, drank a farewell cup of tea in our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,"  de Ville. He promptly issued a proclamation warning all citizens to  preserve the peace. It was both placarded and announced verbally. The  latter was performed by a minor city official, ringing a bell as he  passed through the streets accompanied by policemen.    Toward evening of August 20, 1914, the cafes and restaurants filled up  with hungry German officers and men; every hotel room was occupied, and  provision shops speedily sold out the stores on their shelves. The  Germans at first paid in cash for everything ordered, and preserved an  attitude of nonaggression toward the citizens. But subconsciously there  ran an undercurrent of dread insecurity. At the outset a German officer  was said to have been struck by a sniper's bullet. Somewhat  conspicuously the wounded officer was borne on a litter through the  streets, followed by the dead body of his assailant. Very promptly a  news curtain was drawn down around the city, cutting it off from all  information of the world without. Artillery fire was heard. Presumably  this came from the last stand of the Belgian rear guard in a valley of  the hilly country between Louvain and Brussels. With sustained optimism  to the end, rumor had it that the artillery fire was that of French and  British guns coming to the relief of Louvain. Toward nightfall one or  two groups of alleged snipers were brought in from the suburbs and  marched to the place of execution.    The feeling of a threatened calamity deepened. Another warning  proclamation was issued ordering all citizens to give up their arms.  Further, everyone was ordered to bed at eight o'clock, all windows were  to be closed and all doors unlocked. A burning lamp was to be placed in  each window. On the claim that German soldiers had been killed by  citizens, the burgomaster and several of the city officials were secured  as hostages. A stern proclamation was issued threatening with immediate  execution every citizen found with a weapon in his possession or house.  Every house from which a shot was fired would be burned.    This was on August 22, 1914. By the evening of that day the German army  had passed through Louvain, estimated to the number of 50,000 men. Only  the 3,000 garrison remained in the city. Outwardly, the citizens resumed  their usual daily affairs as if with a sense of relief, but whispers  dropped now and then revealed an abiding terror beneath. Some time  during the next day or two the anticipated calamity fell upon Louvain.  The Germans without any proof insisted that sniping was going on, and  the military authorities seized this pretext to put into force their  threatened reprisal. The torch was thrown into convicted houses. Larger  groups of citizens were led to execution. Thereupon the \"brute\" passion  dormant in soldiers broke the bonds of discipline. Flames burst forth  everywhere. Beneath the lurid glow cast upon the sky above Louvain whole  streets stood out in blackened ruin, and those architectural treasures  of the Halles and the University, with its famous library, were  destroyed beyond hope of repair. Only the walls of St. Peter's Church,  containing many priceless paintings, remained.    Meanwhile, on the morning of August 20, 1914, the German army had swept  away the comparatively small Belgian rear-guard force before Brussels,  and advanced upon the capital. On the previous 17th the King of the  Belgians removed his Government to Antwerp. The diplomatic corps  followed. Mr. Brand Whitlock, the American Minister, however, remained.  In his capacity as a neutral he had assisted stranded Germans in  Brussels from hasty official and mob peril. He stayed to perform a  similar service for the Belgians and Allies. His success in these  efforts won for him German respect and the gratitude of the whole  Belgian nation.    A lingering plan for defending Brussels by throwing up barricades and  constructing wire entanglements, to be manned by the Civic Guard, was  abandoned in the face of wiser counsel. It would merely have resulted in  a bombardment, with needless destruction of life and property. Brussels  was defenseless.    In flight before the German host, refugees of all classes were streaming  into Brussels--young and old, rich and poor, priest and layman. Nearly  all bore some burden of household treasure, many some pathetically  absurd family heirloom. Every kind of vehicle appeared to have been  called into use, from smart carriages drawn by heavy Flemish horses to  little carts harnessed to dogs. Over all reigned a stupefied silence,  broken only by shuffling footfalls. Among them the absence of  automobiles and light horses would indicate all such had been  commandeered by the Belgian military authorities. Their cavalry was  badly in need of good light-weight mounts. At crossroads passage to  imagined safety was blocked by farm live stock driven by bewildered  peasants.    On Thursday morning, August 20, 1914, the burgomaster motored forth to  meet the Germans. His reception and the terms dictated by General von  Arnim were almost identically the same as at Louvain. The burgomaster  was perforce compelled to accept. The scene of the entry of the German  troops into Louvain was repeated at Brussels. There was the same  stolidly silent-packed gathering of onlookers on the sidewalks, the same  thundering triumphant march of the German host. Corps after corps,  probably of those who had fought at Liege, and subsequently passed  around the city on the grand sweep toward the French frontier. Moreover,  huge bodies of German troops were advancing up the valley of the Meuse  and through the woods of the Ardennes. As in Louvain, that night the  hotels, restaurants, cafes, and shops of Brussels were patronized by a  rush of trade which never before totaled such extent in a single day.  Bills of purchase were settled by the Germans in cash. The city was  promptly assessed a war indemnity of $40,000,000.    With the fall of Brussels, the first objective of the Germans may be  said to have been gained. But the right wing of Von Kluck's army was  still operating northward upon Antwerp. The Belgian army had escaped him  within the circle of Antwerp's forts, so that he detailed a force deemed  to be sufficient to hold the enemy secure. Then he struck eastward  between Antwerp and Brussels at Alost, Ghent, and Bruges. In his advance  he swept several divisions of cavalry, also motor cars bearing machine  guns. Beyond Bruges his patrol caught their first glimpse of the North  Sea, drawing in toward another much-hoped-for goal on the English  Channel.    But the Belgian army within security of Antwerp had not been routed. It  had retreated in good order, thanks to the resistance of its right-wing  rear guard. General de Moranville promptly reenforced it with new  volunteers to the extent of some 125,000 men. In addition, he drew upon  a fresh supply of ammunition, and new artillery well horsed. His  cavalry, however, were certainly no better and probably worse than that  with which his army had been complemented originally.    On August 23, 1914, obtaining information that the Germans were in  considerably inferior force at Malines, the Belgians began a vigorous  counteroffensive. General de Moranville drove the Germans out of Malines  on the day following. That was in the nature of a master stroke, for it  gave the Belgians control of the shortest railway from Germany into West  Flanders. Further, since Von Kluck had reached Bruges, and  reenforcements under General von Boehn had passed across the Belgian  direct line on Brussels, the great German right wing was in danger of  being caught in a trap. Von Boehn, therefore, was hurriedly detached  rearward to deal with the Belgian counteroffensive. But this deprived  Von Kluck of his needed reenforcements to overcome 2,000 British marines  landed at Ostend, that, together with the Civic Guard, had beaten back  German patrols from the place. Had the British now landed an army at  Ostend, Von Kluck, between the Belgian and British forces, would have  been in serious danger of annihilation. With the German right wing thus  crumpled, the whole of their offensive would have broken down. But the  British did not come, and so the Belgians were left to fight it out  single handed. This fighting went on for three weeks, with accurate  details lacking. Mainly it was upon the line Aerschot-Dyle  Valley-Termonde, with Antwerp for the Belgian base.    On August 24, 1914, a German Zeppelin sailed over Antwerp and dropped a  number of bombs. The Belgians thrust their right wing forward and  recaptured Alost. They advanced their center to a siege of Cortenburg.  Malines seemed secure. To the Belgians this was a historic triumph.  Famous for its manufacture of lace under the name of Mechlin, almost  every street contained some relic of architectural interest. The  Cathedral of St. Rombaut, the seat of a cardinal archbishop, held upon  its walls some of Van Dyck's masterpieces. Margaret of Austria had held  court in its Palais de Justice.    In this emergency, Von Boehn was heavily reenforced with the Third Army  Corps, reserves from the south, and 15,000 sailors and marines. His army  was now between 250,000 and 300,000 men. This placed overwhelming odds  against the Belgians. But for four days they fought a stubborn battle at  Weerde.    This was from September 13 to 16, 1914, and resulted in the capture of  the Louvain-Malines railway by the Germans. The Belgians had now fought  to the extremity of what could be expected without aid from the Allies.  The sole action left for them was to fall back for a defense of Antwerp.  Von Kluck's right wing of the whole German offensive had completed its  task on Belgian soil.
