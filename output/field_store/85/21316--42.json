He hires what he calls his 'tenderie,'  being from four to five acres of underwood about three to five years  old, pays some thirty shillings for permission to place his springes,  and his greatest ambition is to retain for several years the same  tenderie and the same lodgings, which he improves in comfort from year  to year.    The springes being made and the season of migration near, he goes for  a day to his intended place of sojourn, and cuts as many twigs, about  18 in. in length, as he intends hanging springes. There are two  methods of hanging them--in one the twig is bent into the form of the  figure six, the tail end running through a slit out in the upper part  of the twig. The other method is to sharpen a twig at both ends, and  insert the points into a grower or stem of underwood, thus forming a  bow, of which the stem forms the string below the springe; and hanging  from the lower part of the bow is placed a small branch, with three or  four berries of the mountain ash (there called \"sorbier \"); this is  fixed to the bow by inserting the stalk into a slit in the wood. The  hirer of a new tenderie three or four acres in extent is obliged to  make zigzag footpaths through it, to out away the boughs which  obstruct them, and even to hoe and keep them clean. Having thus  prepared himself, he purchases one or two bushels of mountain ash  berries, with the stalks to which they grow, picked for the purpose  after they are red, but before they are ripe, to prevent falling off:  these he lays out on a table in the loft or attic. The collection of  these berries is a regular trade, and the demand for them is so great  that, although planted expressly by the side of the roads in the  Ardennes, they have been sold as high as 2 pounds the bushel; but the  general price is 5 francs.    We will now suppose our thrush-catcher arrived at his lodgings in the  country--that he has had his footpath cleared by the aid of a  labourer, and that he is off for his first day's sport. He is provided  with a basket, one compartment of which holds his twigs bent or  straight, another his berries; his springes being already attached to  the twigs, he very rapidly drives his knife into a lateral branch, and  fixes them, taking care that the springe hangs neatly in the middle of  the bow, and that the lower part of the springe is about three  fingers' breadth from the bottom. By this arrangement the bird  alighting on the lower side of the bow, and bending his neck to reach  the berries below, places his head in the noose. Finding himself  obstructed in his movements, he attempts to fly away; but the  treacherous noose tightens round his throat, and he is found by the  sportsman hanging by the neck, a victim of misplaced confidence.    The workman, who at this season earns a second harvest by this  pursuit, carries on his industry in wilder districts, or he frequently  obtains permission from his employer to set springes in his master's  woods. In this case he supplies the family with birds, which are  highly appreciated as a delicacy, especially when almost covered with  butter, with a few juniper berries, and some bacon cut into small dice  and baked in a pan. The rest of his take he sells at from 5d. to 10d.  per dozen.    No person who has not lived in the country can imagine the excitement  among all classes when the \"grives\" arrive. If the morning be foggy,  it is a good day for \"grives\"; if bright, bad \"tenderie\"! The reason  is obvious. When the birds arrive in a fog they settle at once in the  woods; if bright, they fly about, seeking the most propitious place  for food.    It appears that redwings and fieldfares are caught by this method  also, as well as a few ring-ousels and blackbirds.    \"Stonehenge\" says that the springe just described was used for snaring  woodcocks, in the following mariner:    \"It used to be the constant practice on all the hill downs in these  parts to place out underwood or furze, about a foot in height, to a  very great extent along the ground, in the shape of a letter V, at the  apex of which an opening would be left, where a hair noose or springe  would be set, which seldom failed to yield the pot-hunter a nightly  supply, as the cock would run along the side of the brushwood feeding,  not taking the trouble to top over it, until he was led into the  snare; but this plan is now, owing to the scarcity of cocks, when  compared with former years, very seldom practised.\"    Ptarmigan are said by Daniels, in his \"Rural Sports,\" to be led up to  springes in nearly the same manner, stones being substituted for  furze.    Another mode of making a springe, which is a capital plan for catching  almost any bird, whether it be a percher or a runner, is this: Procure  an elastic wand (hazel or osier makes the best) of about 3 ft. 6 in.  long, to the top of which tie a piece of twisted horsehair about 3 in.  in length; to the free end attach a little piece of wood of 2 in. in  length, by the middle, cutting one end to an obtuse point, flattened  on the top and underneath. Just underneath this little crosspiece  attach two horsehair springes, at right angles; next cut a little  fork, or rather angle piece, from a tree, one end of which is to be  quite 4 in. long (to drive in the ground), the other end about 0.5 in,  measuring from underneath.    To set this trap, push the long wand into the ground until about 3 ft.  of it is out; then, at a distance of 2 ft, drive in the fork piece,  until only 0.5 in. clears the ground; next bend the wand down in the  form of a bow, and bring the pointed end of the crosspiece under the  peg, or fork, planted in the ground at the other end. The free end is  now a little elevated, while the middle is held very lightly on the  point of the catch, and its opposite end rests lightly on the ground.  On the \"ticklish\" setting of this everything depends.    Next place some blades of grass or light moss so as to hide the fork  piece at the back and sides, taking care that no small sticks  interfere with the proper working of the trap; strew some suitable  seed or bait on the grass or moss, and then carefully place one  horsehair noose in such a manner as to trap a bird should it merely  hop on the crosspiece, and the other noose arrange so as to catch it  by the neck should it attempt to seize the bait or to pass. In either  case it dislodges the crosspiece, which instantly flies up, suspending  the bird by the neck or legs in one or both of the nooses. The  appearance of the set trap before the grass or moss is arranged is as  represented in Fig. 2, which I have drawn from a trap set for that  purpose.    Sometimes this trap (or properly springe) is set with another fork  placed at right angles to the other, and sufficiently distant from it  to just catch the opposite end of the crosspiece, and though, perhaps,  this plan allows it to be set a little finer, it has many  disadvantages.    Fig. 2--\"SPRINGE,\" OR SNARE FOR BIRDS.    Yet another modification of the same springe. The wand or  spring-stick, crosspiece, and nooses as before, but instead of the  simple catch, use a complete bow, with both ends stuck in the ground.  At some little distance from this drive in a straight piece of stick;  next procure a piece of stick with a complete fork or crutch at one  end. To set it, draw down the spring-stick and pull the crosspiece  under the bow by the top side farthest from the spring-stick. Now hold  it firmly with one hand while you place the forked stick with its  crutch pressing against the opposite upright stick, and bring its free  end against the lower end of the crosspiece, and adjust both as finely  as you can. Finally, arrange the nooses in such a manner that if  either of them or the crutched stick is touched the latter falls, and  releasing the crosspiece, the spring-stick flies up, and the bird with  it.    To see the setting of this at a glance, vide Fig. 3 (showing only one  noose, however), which I have \"cribbed\" from a tail piece of Bewick's,  putting it a little out of drawing to show it up.    Fig. 3--\"Springe\" FOR SNIPE.    The next simple trap to be considered is evidently the pit-fall, used  only, however, for large and fierce animals, and varying in  construction in different countries. For descriptions of methods of  baiting for and catching such animals as lions, leopards, tigers,  elephants, etc, consult almost any book on African or Indian field  sports.    Of poisons or intoxicants for capturing birds or animals, I do not  intend to treat, as they are better left to gamekeepers and poachers.    Dead-falls, such as the \"Figure of 4 trap,\" are easy to make, and  useful for killing small animals. The materials required are simply  three ordinary pieces of wood, a small piece of string, or, better  still, wire, and a large, heavy, flat paving stone, or slate. Having  procured three pieces of wood of half an inch square by one foot long,  we call one the \"upright,\" which is simply brought to a point at one  end, somewhat like a chisel. The second is the \"slanting stick,\" which  should be cut to about 8 in. long, having a nick in it about half an  inch from one end, about half way through its depth; the other end is  brought to a chisel point on its upper surface; the third, which is  the \"foot\" or \"bait stick,\" has a square notch, the thickness of the  upright, cut in it, about three inches from one end; the inner end of  this notch is relieved a little, so as not to bind on the upright too  much. Within half an inch of the other end another notch is cut, but  at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#6)"],[1,"radiating roadways of Gaul. Strategically it was important then as it  is important now, and Roman soldiery of the past, as the automobilist  of to-day, had here four great thoroughfares leading from the city.  The first traversed the valleys of the Rhine and the Meuse; the  second passed by Autun, Troyes, Chalons, Reims, Soissons, Noyon, and  Amiens; the third branched in one direction toward Saintes, and in  another to Bordeaux; while the fourth dropped down the Rhone valley  direct to Marseilles.    More than thirty thousand kilometres of roadways were in use  throughout Gaul during the Roman occupation, of which the four great  routes _(viae publicae)_ formed perhaps four thousand.    Of the great highways of France, the _Grandes Routes Nationales_, of  which all travellers by road have the fondest and most vivid  memories, it is well to recall that they were furthered, if not  fathered, by none other than Napoleon, who, for all he laid waste,  set up institutions anew which more than compensated for the  destructions.    The great roadways of France, such as the Route de Bretagne, running  due west from the capital, and those leading to Spain, Switzerland,  Italy, and the Pays Bas, had their origin in the days of  Philippe-Auguste. His predecessors had let the magnificently traced  itineraries of the Romans languish and become covered with grass--if  not actually timber-grown.    The arrangement and classification laid down by Philippe-Auguste have  never been changed, simply modified and renamed; thus the _Routes  Royales_--such as followed nearly a straight line from Paris by the  right bank of the Loire to Amboise and to Nantes--became the _Routes  Nationales_ of to-day.    Soon wheeled traffic became a thing to be considered, and royal  corteges moved about the land with much the same freedom and  stateliness of the state coaches which one sees to-day in pageants,  as relics of a past monarchical splendour.    Louis XI. created the \"_Service des Postes_\" in France, which made  new demands upon the now more numerous routes and roadways, and Louis  XII., Francois I., Henri II., and Charles IX., all made numerous  ordinances for the policing and maintenance of them.    Henri IV., and his minister Sully, built many more of these great  lines of communication, and thus gave the first real and tangible aid  to the commerce and agriculture of the kingdom. He was something of  an aesthetic soul too, this Henri of Bearn, for he was the originator  of the scheme to make the great roadways of France tree-shaded  boulevards, which in truth is what many of them are to-day. This  monarch of love, intrigues, religious reversion, and strange oaths  passed the first (and only, for the present is simply a continuance  thereof) _ordonnance_ making the planting of trees along the national  highroads compulsory on the local authorities.    Under Louis XIV., Colbert continued the good work and put up the  first mile-stone, or whatever its equivalent was in that day,  measuring from the Parvis de Notre Dame at Paris. Some of these Louis  XIV. _bornes_, or stones, still exist, though they have, of course,  been replaced throughout by kilometre stones.    The foregoing tells in brief of the natural development of the  magnificent roads of France. Their history does not differ greatly  from the development of the other great European lines of travel,  across Northern Italy to Switzerland, down the Rhine valley and,  branching into two forks, through Holland and through Belgium to the  North Sea.    [Illustration: On French Roads]    In England the main travel routes run north, east, south, and west  from London as a radiating centre, and each took, in the later  coaching days, such distinctive names as \"The Portsmouth Road,\" \"The  Dover Road,\" \"The Bath Road,\" and \"The Great North Road.\" Their  histories have been written in fascinating manner, so they are only  referred to here.    It is in France, one may almost say, that automobile touring begins  and ends, in that it is more practicable and enjoyable there; and so  _la belle France_ continually projects itself into one's horizon when  viewing the subject of automobilism.    It may be that there are persons living to-day who regret the passing  of the good old times when they travelled--most uncomfortably, be it  remarked--by stage-coach and suffered all the inclemencies of bad  weather _en route_ without a word of protest but a genial grumble,  which they sought to antidote by copious libations of anything liquid  and strong. The automobile has changed all this. The traveller by  automobile doesn't resort to alcoholic drinks to put, or keep, him in  a good humour, and, when he sees a lumbering van or family cart  making its way for many miles from one widely separated region to  another, he accelerates his own motive power and leaves the good old  ways of the good old days as far behind as he can, and recalls the  words of Sidney Smith:      \"The good of other times let others state,    I think it lucky I was born so late.\"    A certain picturesqueness of travel may be wanting when comparing the  automobile with the whirling coach-and-four of other days, but there  is vastly more comfort for all concerned, and no one will regret the  march of progress when he considers that nothing but the means of  transportation has been changed. The delightful prospects of hill and  vale are still there, the long stretches of silent road and, in  France and Germany, great forest routes which are as wild and  unbroken, except for the magnificent surface of the roads, as they  were when mediaeval travelers startled the deer and wild boar. You may  even do this to-day with an automobile in more than one forest tract  of France, and that not far from the great centres of population  either.    The invention of carriage-springs--the same which, with but little  variation, we use on the automobile--by the wife of an apothecary in  the Quartier de St. Antoine at Paris, in 1600, was the prime cause of  the increased popularity of travel by road in France.    In 1776, the routes of France were divided into four categories:  1. Those leading from Paris to the principal interior cities and  seaports.    2. Those communicating directly between the principal cities.    3. Those communicating directly between the cities and towns of one  province and those of another.    4. Those serving the smaller towns and bourgs.    Those in the first class were to be 13.35 metres in width, the second  11.90, the third 10, the fourth 7.90. The road makers and menders of  England and America could not get better models than these.    The advent of the automobile has brought a new factor into the matter  of road making and mending, but certainly he would be an ignorant  person indeed who would claim that the automobile does a tithe of the  road damage that is done by horse-drawn traffic.    At a high rate of speed, however, the automobile does raise a fine  sandy dust, and exposes the macadam. A French authority states that  up to twenty to twenty-five kilometres an hour the automobile does  little or no harm to the roads, but when they increase to over fifty  kilometres an hour they do damage the surface somewhat. Just what the  ultimate outcome of it will be remains to be seen, but France is  unlikely to do anything which will work against the interests of the  automobilist.    In consequence of this newer and faster mode of travelling, it is  being found that on some parts of the roads the convexity of the  surface is too great, and especially at curves, where fast motors  frequently skid on the rounded surface. To obviate this a piece of  road near the Croix d'Augas in the Orleannais has had the outer side  of the curve raised eight centimetres above the centre of the road,  in somewhat the same manner as on the curve of a railway. Since this  innovation has proved highly successful and pleasing to the devotees  of the new form of travel, it is likely to be further adopted.    In the early period of the construction of French roads the earth  formation was made horizontal, but Tresaguet, a French engineer,  introduced the rounded form, or camber, and this is the method now  almost generally adopted, both in France and England. Only some  14,000 kilometres of the national routes have a hand-set foundation,  the others being what are termed broken-stone roads--the stone used  is broken in pieces and laid on promiscuously, after the system  introduced by Macadam. Some of the second and third class, roads are  constructed of gravel, and others, of earth.    From the official report of 1893 it appears that the cost of  maintenance of roads in France was as follows:    COST OF LABOUR AND MATERIALS                          Annual Total      Annual Cost                          Cost            per Kilometre                                             (AV.)  Routes Nationales       22,570,300 fcs.     775 fcs.  Routes Departmentales   14,555,850          600  Chemins Communication   82,474,450          423  Chemins Vicinaux        44,211,125          200      The above is for materials and labour on the roadways only, and  something between 33 1/3 per cent, and 50 per cent. is added for the  maintenance of watercourses and sidewalks, the planting of trees, and  for general administrative expenses.    [Illustration: Kilometre Stones in France]    Excepting for twenty kilometres or so around Paris, the vehicular  traffic on the country roads of France does not seem to be in any way  excessive. The style of vehicles in France that carry into the cities  farm and garden produce, wood, stone, etc., are large wagons with  wheels six to seven feet in diameter. These wagons are more easily  hauled and naturally do less damage to the roads than narrow-tired,  low-wheeled trucks or drays. The horses in Paris, and in the country,  are nearly all plain shod, with no heels or toes to act like a pick  to break up the surface."]]]
