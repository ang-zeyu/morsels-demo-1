Everyone stood aghast at such brutality, at such inhumanity to man, in  this great free republic of ours. It seemed as if the cup of human  endurance had been filled to the brim, as if out of the ranks of the  outraged masses some one would rise to call those to account who had  caused it all.    And some one rose in mighty indignation against the horrors of wealth  and power. It was Alexander Berkman!    A youth with a vision of a grand and beautiful world based upon freedom  and harmony, and with boundless sympathy for the suffering of the  masses. One whose deep, sensitive nature could not endure the barbarisms  of our times. Such was the personality of the man who staked his life as  a protest against tyranny and iniquity; and such has Alexander Berkman  remained all these long, dreary fourteen years.    Nothing was left undone to crush the body and spirit of this man; but  sorrow and suffering make for sacred force, and those who have never  felt it will fail to realize how it is that Alexander Berkman will  return to those who loved and esteemed him, to those whom he loved so  well, and still loves so well,--the oppressed and down-trodden  millions--with the same intense, sweet spirit and with a clearer and  grander vision of a world of human justice and equality.

KIRILOV, OF THE \"RUSS.\")      December 18th. Near the Gorbaty Bridge, Moscow. A group of soldiers of  various arms and an officer. Great animation, jokes, cries,  gesticulation, contented faces. A student has fallen into their hands.    \"Well, boys, make room,\" says the officer. \"The performance begins!\"    \"Take off your trousers,\" says the officer, turning to the student. The  latter is pale, silent, and does not move.    \"Trousers off!\" cries the officer, in rage; but the student, without a  drop of blood in his face, whiter than the snow, does not move, but only  looks around in silence with horrified eyes and meets everywhere the  triumphant faces of his tormentors. He drops his head and remains silent  as before.    \"Well, then, boys, we must assist our dear student; his hands, poor  thing, are frost bitten and do not obey.\"    The voice of the officer changes; it becomes sweet and smooth. He looks  at the student with pleasure.    \"Take off his dear little trousers!\" he orders his soldiers. The latter  unbutton and tear down his trousers. The student does not resist. Then  he is thrown on the ground.    \"Give him beans, boys!\"    Two powerfully-built soldiers step forward, holding whips in their  hands.    The flogging begins. It lasts a long time, accompanied by loud laughter,  jokes and noise. The student is silent all the time and lies with his  face buried in the snow. He is constantly being asked whether he feels  allright, and is kicked with the boots on his head.    \"Halt!\" cries the officer at last, when the whole body of the student  has been covered with blood. The excited soldiers do not leave off at  once, but continue for some time. At last they stop.    \"Please, sir, won't you allow us, too, to have a little game?\" smilingly  ask a couple of artillery soldiers, saluting the officer.    \"Well, have a go at him,\" says the officer kindly.    The second shift gets to work, and turning up their sleeves, takes over  the bloody whips and resumes the flogging of the student, who still, as  before, is lying in the snow without uttering a word. Only his body  still thrills instinctively as the soldiers get more and more excited  and the blows become more and more frequent.    \"Sir, we, too, want some of the lark,\" impatiently interfered some of  the dragoons, and having received the permission of the officer,  substituted themselves for the artillery men and with new force and zeal  began to flog the student, who still lay strictly as before, only his  body scarcely moving.    \"Well, here you are, you got your higher education--all the three  faculties!\" somebody joked as the flogging at last stopped and the  student lay motionless in the snow.    But he was not flogged to death. He was taken to the other side of the  river and there shot.      _II.--Lieutenant Schmidt, of the Sevastopol Mutiny, after being  captured._    (From a letter received by Prof. Miliukov from a lady correspondent who  saw Schmidt in the Fortress and had the tale from his own lips.)    ....He only remembers how the officers of the \"Rostislavl\" posted him  naked, with a broken leg, between two sentries in their mess-room and  approached him in turns, shaking their fists in his face and abusing him  in the vilest terms. Schmidt's son, who, for some unaccountable reason,  had been kept in fortress for two months, said to me: \"I cannot tell you  how they abused my father, the terms are unpronounceable.\" Schmidt  himself spoke to me sobbingly of the painful treatment meted out to him  by the officers.... For twenty-four hours the two of them, father and  son, were kept stark naked and without food, under a fierce electric  light, on the open deck. They lay together, pressing against each other  so as to warm themselves, and everyone who passed looked at them, and  those who wanted, abused them. When Schmidt, being wounded, asked for a  drop of water, the senior officer shouted at him: \"Silence, or I'll stop  your gullet with my fist.\"    [Illustration]          PATERNALISTIC GOVERNMENT.    By THEODORE SCHROEDER.      HISTORY serves no purpose to those who cannot, or do not avail  themselves of it as a means of learning helpful lessons, for present  use. From a few sources not readily accessible to the masses, I have  copied a partial summary of paternalistic legislation which even the  most devout devotees to mass or ruling class wisdom would now decline to  defend.    It is helpful, perhaps, to look back to the persistent fallacious  assumption that men can be made frugal and useful members of society by  laws and edicts. Every thoughtful student feels sure that future  generations will look upon our present efforts to regulate the  self-regarding activities of humans with the same cynical leer as that  which now flits over our faces as we read the following:--    The earliest sumptuary law was passed 215 B. C., enacted that no woman  should own more than half an ounce of gold or wear a dress of different  colors, or ride in a carriage in the city or in any town or within a  mile of it, unless on occasion of public sacrifices. This law was  repealed in twenty years. In 181 B. C. a law was passed limiting the  number of guests at entertainments. In 161 B. C. it was provided that at  certain festivals named the expense of entertainments should not exceed  100 asses, and on ten other days of each month should not exceed 10  asses. Later on it was allowed that 200 asses, valued at about $300, be  spent upon marriage days.    A statute under Julian extended the privileges of extravagance on  certain occasions to the equivalent of $10, and $50 upon marriage  feasts. Under Tiberius, $100 was made the limit of expense for  entertainments. Julius Caesar proposed another law by which actual  magistrates, or magistrates elect, should not dine abroad except at  certain prescribed places.    Sumptuary laws, that is to say, laws which profess to regulate minutely  what people shall eat and drink, what guests they shall entertain, what  clothes they shall wear, what armor they shall possess, what limit shall  be put to their property, what expense they shall incur at their  funerals, were considered by the Early and Middle Ages as absolutely  necessary for the proper government of mankind.    Tiberius issued an edict against people kissing each other when they met  and against tavern keepers selling pastry. Lycurgus even prohibited  finely decorated ceilings and doors. In England the statutes of  laborers, reciting the pestilence and scarcity of servants, made it  compulsory on every person who had no merchandise, craft or land on  which to live, to serve at fixed wages, otherwise to be committed to  gaol till he found sureties. At a latter day, all men between twelve and  sixty not employed were compelled to hire themselves as servants in  husbandry; and unmarried women between twelve and forty were also liable  to be hired, otherwise to be imprisoned. All this, of course, was to  compel people of modest wealth to remain among the laboring class purely  for their own good. (?) But they were quite impartial in enforcing  benefits, since the Star Chamber also assumed to fine persons for not  accepting knighthood.    Compulsion was also used at the time of the Reformation, to uphold the  Protestant faith and keep people in the right way. Refusing to confess  or receive the sacrament was first made subject to fine or imprisonment,  and a second offense was a felony punishable by death, and involved  forfeiture of land and goods. Those who, having no lawful excuse, failed  to attend the parish church, in the time of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/273"],[0,"The Smalcald Articles (#6)"],[1,"Golden Year, and finally souls became so cheap that he  released one for a farthing.    But all this, too, was of no avail. For although the Pope  taught men to depend upon, and trust in, these indulgences  [for salvation], yet he rendered the [whole] matter again  uncertain. For in his bulls he declares: Whoever would share  in the indulgences or a Golden Year must be contrite, and have  confessed, and pay money. Now, we have heard above that this  contrition and confession are with them uncertain and  hypocrisy. Likewise, also no one knew what soul was in  purgatory, and if some were therein, no one knew which had  properly repented and confessed. Thus he took the precious  money [the Pope snatched up the holy pence], and comforted  them meanwhile with [led them to confidence in] his power and  indulgence, and [then again led them away from that and]  directed them again to their uncertain work.    If, now [although], there were some who did not believe  [acknowledge] themselves guilty of such actual sins in  [committed by] thoughts, words, and works,--as I, and such  as I, in monasteries and chapters [fraternities or colleges of  priests], wished to be monks and priests, and by fasting,  watching, praying, saying Mass, coarse garments, and hard  beds, etc., fought against [strove to resist] evil thoughts,  and in full earnest and with force wanted to be holy, and yet  the hereditary, inborn evil sometimes did in sleep what it is  wont to do (as also St. Augustine and Jerome among others  confess),--still each one held the other in esteem, so that  some, according to our teaching, were regarded as holy,  without sin and full of good works, so much so that with this  mind we would communicate and sell our good works to others,  as being superfluous to us for heaven. This is indeed true,  and seals, letters, and instances [that this happened] are at  hand.    [When there were such, I say] These did not need repentance.  For of what would they repent, since they had not indulged  wicked thoughts? What would they confess [concerning words not  uttered], since they had avoided words? For what should they  render satisfaction, since they were so guiltless of any deed  that they could even sell their superfluous righteousness to  other poor sinners? Such saints were also the Pharisees and  scribes in the time of Christ.    Here comes the fiery angel, St. John [Rev. 10], the true  preacher of [true] repentance, and with one [thunderclap and]  bolt hurls both [those selling and those buying works] on one  heap, and says: Repent! Matt. 3, 2. Now, the former [the poor  wretches] imagine: Why, we have repented! The latter [the  rest] say: We need no repentance. John says: Repent ye, both  of you, for ye are false penitents; so are these [the rest]  false saints [or hypocrites], and all of you on either side  need the forgiveness of sins, because neither of you know what  true sin is not to say anything about your duty to repent of  it and shun it. For no one of you is good; you are full of  unbelief, stupidity, and ignorance of God and God's will. For  here He is present of whose fulness have all we received, and  grace for grace, John 1, 16, and without Him no man can be  just before God. Therefore, if you wish to repent, repent  aright- your penance will not accomplish anything [is  nothing]. And you hypocrites, who do not need repentance, you  serpents' brood, who has assured you that you will escape the  wrath to come? etc. Matt. 3, 7; Luke 3, 7.    In the same way Paul also preaches, Rom. 3, 10-12: There is  none righteous, there is none that understandeth, there is  none that seeketh after God, there is none that doeth good, no  not one; they are all gone out of the way; they are together  become unprofitable. And Acts 17, 30: God now commandeth all  men everywhere to repent. \"All men,\" he says; no one excepted  who is a man. This repentance teaches us to discern sin,  namely, that we are altogether lost, and that there is nothing  good in us from head to foot [both within and without], and  that we must absolutely become new and other men.    This repentance is not piecemeal [partial] and beggarly  [fragmentary], like that which does penance for actual sins,  nor is it uncertain like that. For it does not debate what is  or is not sin, but hurls everything on a heap, and says: All  in us is nothing but sin [affirms that, with respect to us,  all is simply sin (and there is nothing in us that is not sin  and guilt)]. What is the use of [For why do we wish]  investigating, dividing, or distinguishing a long time? For  this reason, too, this contrition is not [doubtful or]  uncertain. For there is nothing left with which we can think  of any good thing to pay for sin, but there is only a sure  despairing concerning all that we are, think, speak, or do  [all hope must be cast aside in respect of everything], etc.    In like manner confession, too, cannot be false, uncertain, or  piecemeal [mutilated or fragmentary]. For he who confesses  that all in him is nothing but sin comprehends all sins  excludes none, forgets none. Neither can the satisfaction be  uncertain, because it is not our uncertain, sinful work, but  it is the suffering and blood of the [spotless and] innocent  Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world.    Of this repentance John preaches, and afterwards Christ in the  Gospel, and we also. By this [preaching of] repentance we dash  to the ground the Pope and everything that is built upon our  good works. For all is built upon a rotten and vain  foundation, which is called a good work or law, even though no  good work is there, but only wicked works, and no one does the  Law (as Christ, John 7, 19, says), but all transgress it.  Therefore the building [that is raised upon it] is nothing but  falsehood and hypocrisy, even [in the part] where it is most  holy and beautiful.    And in Christians this repentance continues until death,  because, through the entire life it contends with sin  remaining in the flesh, as Paul, Rom. 7, 14-25, [shows]  testifies that he wars with the law in his members, etc.; and  that, not by his own powers, but by the gift of the Holy Ghost  that follows the remission of sins. This gift daily cleanses  and sweeps out the remaining sins, and works so as to render  man truly pure and holy.    The Pope, the theologians, the jurists, and every other man  know nothing of this [from their own reason], but it is a  doctrine from heaven, revealed through the Gospel, and must  suffer to be called heresy by the godless saints [or  hypocrites].    On the other hand, if certain sectarists would arise, some of  whom are perhaps already extant, and in the time of the  insurrection [of the peasants] came to my own view, holding  that all those who had once received the Spirit or the  forgiveness of sins, or had become believers, even though they  should afterwards sin, would still remain in the faith, and  such sin would not harm them, and [hence] crying thus: \"Do  whatever you please; if you believe, it all amounts to  nothing; faith blots out all sins,\" etc.--they say, besides,  that if any one sins after he has received faith and the  Spirit, he never truly had the Spirit and faith: I have had  before me [seen and heard] many such insane men, and I fear  that in some such a devil is still remaining [hiding and  dwelling].    It is, accordingly, necessary to know and to teach that when  holy men, still having and feeling original sin, also daily  repenting of and striving with it, happen to fall into  manifest sins, as David into adultery, murder, and blasphemy,  that then faith and the Holy Ghost has departed from them  [they cast out faith and the Holy Ghost]. For the Holy Ghost  does not permit sin to have dominion, to gain the upper hand  so as to be accomplished, but represses and restrains it so  that it must not do what it wishes. But if it does what it  wishes, the Holy Ghost and faith are [certainly] not present.  For St. John says, 1 Ep. 3, 9: Whosoever is born of God doth  not commit sin,... and he cannot sin. And yet it is also the  truth when the same St. John says, 1 Ep. 1, 8: If we say that  we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in  us.      IV. Of the Gospel.    We will now return to the Gospel, which not merely in one way  gives us counsel and aid against sin; for God is  superabundantly rich [and liberal] in His grace [and  goodness]. First, through the spoken Word by which the  forgiveness of sins is preached [He commands to be preached]  in the whole world; which is the peculiar office of the  Gospel. Secondly, through Baptism. Thirdly, through the holy  Sacrament of the Altar. Fourthly, through the power of the  keys, and also through the mutual conversation and consolation  of brethren, Matt. 18, 20: Where two or three are gathered  together, etc.      V. Of Baptism.    Baptism is nothing else than the Word of God in the water,  commanded by His institution, or, as Paul says, a washing in  the Word; as also Augustine says: Let the Word come to the  element, and it becomes a Sacrament. And for this reason we do  not hold with Thomas and the monastic preachers [or  Dominicans] who forget the Word (God's institution) and say  that God has imparted to the water a spiritual power, which  through the water washes away sin. Nor [do we agree] with  Scotus and the Barefooted monks [Minorites or Franciscan  monks], who teach that, by the assistance of the divine will,  Baptism washes away sins, and that this ablution occurs only  through the will of God, and by no means through the Word or  water. Of the baptism of children we hold that children ought  to be baptized. For they belong to the promised redemption  made through Christ, and the Church should administer it  [Baptism and the announcement of that promise] to them.      VI.
