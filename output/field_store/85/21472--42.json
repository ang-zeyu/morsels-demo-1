When, then, we ask why a crime was done, we believe it not, unless it  appear that there might have been some desire of obtaining some of those  which we called lower goods, or a fear of losing them. For they are  beautiful and comely; although compared with those higher and beatific  goods, they be abject and low. A man hath murdered another; why? he  loved his wife or his estate; or would rob for his own livelihood; or  feared to lose some such things by him; or, wronged, was on fire to be  revenged. Would any commit murder upon no cause, delighted simply in  murdering? who would believe it? for as for that furious and savage man,  of whom it is said that he was gratuitously evil and cruel, yet is the  cause assigned; \"lest\" (saith he) \"through idleness hand or heart should  grow inactive.\" And to what end? that, through that practice of guilt,  he might, having taken the city, attain to honours, empire, riches, and  be freed from fear of the laws, and his embarrassments from domestic  needs, and consciousness of villainies. So then, not even Catiline  himself loved his own villainies, but something else, for whose sake he  did them.    What then did wretched I so love in thee, thou theft of mine, thou deed  of darkness, in that sixteenth year of my age? Lovely thou wert not,  because thou wert theft. But art thou any thing, that thus I speak to  thee? Fair were the pears we stole, because they were Thy creation, Thou  fairest of all, Creator of all, Thou good God; God, the sovereign good  and my true good. Fair were those pears, but not them did my wretched  soul desire; for I had store of better, and those I gathered, only that  I might steal. For, when gathered, I flung them away, my only feast  therein being my own sin, which I was pleased to enjoy. For if aught  of those pears came within my mouth, what sweetened it was the sin.  And now, O Lord my God, I enquire what in that theft delighted me; and  behold it hath no loveliness; I mean not such loveliness as in justice  and wisdom; nor such as is in the mind and memory, and senses, and  animal life of man; nor yet as the stars are glorious and beautiful in  their orbs; or the earth, or sea, full of embryo-life, replacing by its  birth that which decayeth; nay, nor even that false and shadowy beauty  which belongeth to deceiving vices.    For so doth pride imitate exaltedness; whereas Thou alone art God  exalted over all. Ambition, what seeks it, but honours and glory?  whereas Thou alone art to be honoured above all, and glorious for  evermore. The cruelty of the great would fain be feared; but who is  to be feared but God alone, out of whose power what can be wrested or  withdrawn? when, or where, or whither, or by whom? The tendernesses of  the wanton would fain be counted love: yet is nothing more tender than  Thy charity; nor is aught loved more healthfully than that Thy truth,  bright and beautiful above all. Curiosity makes semblance of a desire  of knowledge; whereas Thou supremely knowest all. Yea, ignorance  and foolishness itself is cloaked under the name of simplicity and  uninjuriousness; because nothing is found more single than Thee: and  what less injurious, since they are his own works which injure the  sinner? Yea, sloth would fain be at rest; but what stable rest besides  the Lord? Luxury affects to be called plenty and abundance; but Thou art  the fulness and never-failing plenteousness of incorruptible pleasures.  Prodigality presents a shadow of liberality: but Thou art the most  overflowing Giver of all good. Covetousness would possess many things;  and Thou possessest all things. Envy disputes for excellency: what more  excellent than Thou? Anger seeks revenge: who revenges more justly  than Thou? Fear startles at things unwonted and sudden, which endangers  things beloved, and takes forethought for their safety; but to Thee what  unwonted or sudden, or who separateth from Thee what Thou lovest? Or  where but with Thee is unshaken safety? Grief pines away for things  lost, the delight of its desires; because it would have nothing taken  from it, as nothing can from Thee.    Thus doth the soul commit fornication, when she turns from Thee, seeking  without Thee, what she findeth not pure and untainted, till she returns  to Thee. Thus all pervertedly imitate Thee, who remove far from Thee,  and lift themselves up against Thee. But even by thus imitating Thee,  they imply Thee to be the Creator of all nature; whence there is no  place whither altogether to retire from Thee. What then did I love in  that theft? and wherein did I even corruptly and pervertedly imitate my  Lord? Did I wish even by stealth to do contrary to Thy law, because  by power I could not, so that being a prisoner, I might mimic a maimed  liberty by doing with impunity things unpermitted me, a darkened  likeness of Thy Omnipotency? Behold, Thy servant, fleeing from his Lord,  and obtaining a shadow. O rottenness, O monstrousness of life, and depth  of death! could I like what I might not, only because I might not?    What shall I render unto the Lord, that, whilst my memory recalls these  things, my soul is not affrighted at them? I will love Thee, O Lord,  and thank Thee, and confess unto Thy name; because Thou hast forgiven me  these so great and heinous deeds of mine. To Thy grace I ascribe it, and  to Thy mercy, that Thou hast melted away my sins as it were ice. To Thy  grace I ascribe also whatsoever I have not done of evil; for what might  I not have done, who even loved a sin for its own sake? Yea, all I  confess to have been forgiven me; both what evils I committed by my own  wilfulness, and what by Thy guidance I committed not. What man is  he, who, weighing his own infirmity, dares to ascribe his purity and  innocency to his own strength; that so he should love Thee the less, as  if he had less needed Thy mercy, whereby Thou remittest sins to those  that turn to Thee? For whosoever, called by Thee, followed Thy voice,  and avoided those things which he reads me recalling and confessing  of myself, let him not scorn me, who being sick, was cured by that  Physician, through whose aid it was that he was not, or rather was less,  sick: and for this let him love Thee as much, yea and more; since by  whom he sees me to have been recovered from such deep consumption of  sin, by Him he sees himself to have been from the like consumption of  sin preserved.    What fruit had I then (wretched man!) in those things, of the  remembrance whereof I am now ashamed? Especially, in that theft which  I loved for the theft's sake; and it too was nothing, and therefore the  more miserable I, who loved it. Yet alone I had not done it: such was I  then, I remember, alone I had never done it. I loved then in it also  the company of the accomplices, with whom I did it? I did not then love  nothing else but the theft, yea rather I did love nothing else; for that  circumstance of the company was also nothing. What is, in truth? who can  teach me, save He that enlighteneth my heart, and discovereth its  dark corners? What is it which hath come into my mind to enquire, and  discuss, and consider? For had I then loved the pears I stole,  and wished to enjoy them, I might have done it alone, had the bare  commission of the theft sufficed to attain my pleasure; nor needed  I have inflamed the itching of my desires by the excitement of  accomplices. But since my pleasure was not in those pears, it was in the  offence itself, which the company of fellow-sinners occasioned.    What then was this feeling? For of a truth it was too foul: and woe was  me, who had it. But yet what was it? Who can understand his errors? It  was the sport, which as it were tickled our hearts, that we beguiled  those who little thought what we were doing, and much disliked it. Why  then was my delight of such sort that I did it not alone? Because none  doth ordinarily laugh alone? ordinarily no one; yet laughter sometimes  masters men alone and singly when no one whatever is with them, if  anything very ludicrous presents itself to their senses or mind. Yet  I had not done this alone; alone I had never done it. Behold my God,  before Thee, the vivid remembrance of my soul; alone, I had never  committed that theft wherein what I stole pleased me not, but that  I stole; nor had it alone liked me to do it, nor had I done it. O  friendship too unfriendly! thou incomprehensible inveigler of the soul,  thou greediness to do mischief out of mirth and wantonness, thou thirst  of others' loss, without lust of my own gain or revenge: but when it is  said, \"Let's go, let's do it,\" we are ashamed not to be shameless.    Who can disentangle that twisted and intricate knottiness? Foul is it: I  hate to think on it, to look on it. But Thee I long for, O Righteousness  and Innocency, beautiful and comely to all pure eyes, and of a  satisfaction unsating. With Thee is rest entire, and life imperturbable.  Whoso enters into Thee, enters into the joy of his Lord: and shall not  fear, and shall do excellently in the All-Excellent. I sank away from  Thee, and I wandered, O my God, too much astray from Thee my stay, in  these days of my youth, and I became to myself a barren land.          BOOK III      To Carthage I came, where there sang all around me in my ears a cauldron  of unholy loves. I loved not yet, yet I loved to love, and out of a  deep-seated want, I hated myself for wanting not. I sought what I might  love, in love with loving, and safety I hated, and a way without snares.  For within me was a famine of that inward food, Thyself, my God; yet,  through that famine I was not hungered; but was without all longing for  incorruptible sustenance, not because filled therewith, but the more  empty, the more I loathed it. For this cause my soul was sickly and full  of sores, it miserably cast itself forth, desiring to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32962"],[0,"A Handbook of Laboratory Glass-Blowing (#6)"],[1,"shape and the whole thermometer filled with alcohol as described on page  44. Now heat the thermometer to a little above the maximum temperature  that it is intended to record, and pour clean mercury into the open bulb  while holding the thermometer vertically. Allow to cool, and the mercury  will be sucked down. The second dumb-bell is now introduced, sufficient  alcohol being allowed to remain in the open bulb to about half fill it,  and the alcohol in this bulb is boiled to expel air. The tube through  which the bulb was filled in now sealed.    _Clinical Thermometers._--The clinical thermometer is a maximum  thermometer of a different type. In this case there is a constriction  of the bore at a point just above the bulb. When the mercury in the bulb  commences to contract, the mercury column breaks at the constriction and  remains stationary in the tube, thus showing the maximum temperature to  which it has risen.    _Vacuum Tubes._--There are so many forms of these that it is scarcely  practicable or desirable to give detailed instructions for making them;  but an application of the various methods of glass-working which have  already been explained should enable the student to construct most of  the simpler varieties. An interesting vacuum tube is made which has no  electrodes, but contains a quantity of mercury. When the tube is rocked  so as to cause friction between the mercury and the glass sufficient  charge is produced to cause the tube to glow.    _A Sprengel Pump._--This, in its simplest form, is illustrated by _a_,  Fig. 12. Such a form, although highly satisfactory in action, needs  constant watching while in action, as should the mercury funnel become  empty air will enter the exhausted vessel. Obviously, the fall-tube must  be made not less than thirty inches long; the measurement being taken  from the junction of the exhaustion branch with the fall-tube to the top  of the turned-up end.    [Illustration: Fig. 12]    _A Macleod Pump._--One form of this is illustrated by _b_, Fig. 12. It  has the advantage that the mercury reservoir may be allowed to become  empty without affecting the vacuum in the vessel being exhausted.    _\"Spinning\" Glass._--By the use of suitable appliances, it is quite  possible to draw out a continuous thread of glass, which is so thin as  to have almost the flexibility and apparent softness of woollen fibre; a  mass of such threads constitutes the \"glass wool\" of commerce.    The appliances necessary are:--a blowpipe capable of giving a  well-formed flame of about six or eight inches in length, a wheel of  from eighteen inches to three feet in diameter and having a flat rim of  about three inches wide, and a device for rotating the wheel at a speed  of about three hundred revolutions per minute.    A very satisfactory arrangement may be made from an old bicycle; the  back wheel having the tyre removed and a flat rim of tin fastened on in  its place. The chain drive should be retained, but one of the cranks  removed and a handle substituted for the remaining pedal. The whole  device is shown by Fig. 13.    [Illustration: Fig. 13]    The procedure in \"spinning\" glass is as follows:--First melt the end of  a glass rod and obtain a large mass of thoroughly softened glass, now  spin the wheel at such a speed that its own momentum will keep it  spinning for several seconds. Touch the end of the melted rod with  another piece of glass and, without withdrawing the original rod from  the blowpipe flame, draw out a thread of molten glass and twist it round  the spinning wheel. If this is done properly, the thread of glass will  grip on the flat rim, and by continuing to turn the wheel by hand it is  possible to draw out a continuous thread from the melted rod, which must  be advanced in the blowpipe flame as it is drawn on the wheel. If the  rod is not advanced sufficiently the thread will melt off, if it is  advanced too much, so as to heat the thick part and allow the glass to  become too cool at the point of drawing out, then the thread will become  too thick, but it is easy after a little practice to obtain the right  conditions. Practice is necessary also in order to find the right speed  for the wheel.    When sufficient glass has been \"spun,\" the whole \"hank\" of thin thread  may be removed by drawing the thumb-nail across the wheel at any point  on its flat rim, thus breaking the threads, and allowing the \"hank\" to  open.    _Brushes for Use with Strong Acids._--Glass wool, if of fine enough  texture to be highly flexible, can be used to make acid-resisting  brushes. A convenient method for mounting the spun glass is to melt the  ends of the threads together into a bead, and then to fuse the bead on  to a rod; thus giving a brush. If a pointed brush is necessary, the  point may be ground on an ordinary grindstone or carborundum wheel by  pressing the loose end of the spun glass against the grinding wheel with  a thin piece of cardboard.    When using brushes of this description, it is well to bear in mind the  fact that there is always a liability of a few threads of glass breaking  off during use.

Calibration and Graduation       of Apparatus. Thermometers. Exhaustion of Apparatus. Joining       Glass and Metal. Silvering Glass.      There are three kinds of glass rod and tubing which are easily  obtainable; these are soda-glass, which is that usually supplied by  chemical apparatus dealers when no particular glass is specified;  combustion-glass, which is supplied for work requiring a glass that does  not so easily soften or fuse as soda-glass; and lead-glass, which is  less common. There are also resistance-glass, made for use where very  slight solubility in water or other solutions is desirable, and a number  of other special glasses; but of these soda-glass, combustion-glass,  lead-glass, and resistance-glass are the most important to the  glass-blower whose work is connected with laboratory needs.    _Soda-Glass._--Consists chiefly of sodium silicate, but contains  smaller quantities of aluminum silicate, and often of calcium silicate;  there may also be traces of several other compounds.    The ordinary soda-glass tubing melts easily in the blowpipe flame, it  has not a long intermediate or viscous stage during fusion, but becomes  highly fluid rather suddenly; it does not blacken in the reducing flame.  Bad soda-glass or that which has been kept for many years, tends to  devitrify when worked. That is to say the glass becomes more or less  crystalline and infusible while it is in the flame; and in this case it  is often impossible to do good work with that particular sample of  glass; although the devitrification may sometimes be remedied by heating  the devitrified glass to a higher temperature. The presence of aluminum  compounds appears to have some influence on the tendency of the glass to  resist devitrification. Soda-glass, as a rule, is more liable to crack  by sudden heating than lead-glass, and articles made from soda-glass  often tend to crack spontaneously if badly made or, in the case of  heavier and thicker articles, if insufficiently annealed.    _Combustion-Glass._--Is usually a glass containing more calcium silicate  and potassium silicate than the ordinary \"soft\" soda-glass. It is much  less fusible than ordinary soda-glass, and passes through a longer  intermediate or viscous stage when heated. Such a glass is not very  suitable for use with the blowpipe owing to the difficulty experienced  in obtaining a sufficiently high temperature. If, however, a certain  amount of oxygen is mixed with the air used in producing the blowpipe  flame this difficulty is minimised.    _Resistance-Glass._--May contain zinc, magnesium, and other substances.  As a rule it is harder than ordinary soda-glass, and less suitable for  working in the blowpipe flame. It should have very little tendency to  dissolve in water, and hence is used when traces of alkali or silicates  would prove injurious in the solutions for which the glass vessels are  to be used.    _Lead-Glass._--This, or \"flint\" glass as it is often called from the  fact that silica in the form of crushed and calcined flint was often  used in making the English lead-glasses, contains a considerable  proportion of lead silicate. Such a glass has, usually, a particularly  bright appearance, a high refractive index, and is specially suitable  for the production of the heavy \"cut-glass\" ware.    Lead-glass tubing is easy to work in the blowpipe flame, melts easily,  but does not become fluid quite so suddenly as most soda-glasses;  articles made from it are remarkably stable and free from tendency to  spontaneous cracking, although, as is essential for all the heavy or  \"glass-house\" work, the massive articles need annealing in the oven.    The two chief disadvantages of lead-glass for laboratory work are that  it is blackened by the reducing gases if held too near to the blue cone  of the blowpipe flame, and that it is rather easily attacked by chemical  reagents; thus ammonium sulphide will cause blackening.    The effect of the reducing flame on lead is not altogether a  disadvantage, however; because a little care in adjusting the blowpipe  and a little care in holding the glass in the right position will enable  the student to work lead-glass without producing the faintest trace of  blackening. This, in addition to being a valuable exercise in  manipulation, will teach him to keep his blowpipe in good order, and  prove a useful aid in his early efforts to judge as to the condition of  the flame. It prevents discouragement if the student does his  preliminary work with the soda-glass, but he should certainly make  experiments with lead-glass as soon as he has acquired reasonable  dexterity with soda-glass."]]]
