In February, 1739, Whitfield, for the first time, preached in  the open air, at Kingswood, near his native place, Bristol, to the wild  and lawless colliers of the then _Black Country_ of England. In the May  following he persuaded John Wesley to join him there, and to imitate his  example. And then, for the first time, _religious hysteria_ began to  manifest itself in England. Men and women of all ages fell down in  convulsions, and cried aloud for mercy. And honest John Wesley said, \"I  am persuaded that it is the devil tearing them as they are coming to  Christ.\"--_Wesley's Journals._          THINGS HARD TO BELIEVE.    BY D.H. PATTERSON.      \"For myself I still live and doubt. You know I can't believe everything.  There are so many things hard to believe--I can't see them.\"    So wrote an honest, intelligent young man, who was standing on the verge  of infidelity. Nor is he alone in his doubts. Many persons will not  accept the Bible on account of its mysteries _or miracles_. To doubt  seems to be as natural as to believe. Sir Wm. Hamilton says:  \"Philosophers have been unanimous in making doubt the first step in  philosophy.\" When Paul says, \"Prove all things,\" he tells us doubt a  thing until it is tested. To doubt is not necessarily a fault, but to  continue in doubt is blameworthy. If we are doubtful about a thing it is  our duty as intelligent beings to examine the testimony concerning it,  and so end our doubt. But shall we reject a thing because it is hard to  believe? If the Bible had nothing in it hard to comprehend we would not  be likely to accept it as divine in its origin; because the mind that  comprehends a matter is no more limited, in regard to that matter, than  the mind that conceived it. Consequently, if we could comprehend  everything in the Bible there would be no divinity of infinite  attributes about it to contrast with the limited powers of human nature.  Its miracles are proof of its divine origin.    If you leave the Bible, to what will you go? Are all things hard to  believe in the Bible? Does a man's believing power rest upon flowery  beds of ease in the teaching of infidelity? In the so-called realms of  free-thought is there nothing hard to believe? Will it no more be said  that--      \"Not a truth has to art or to science been given,    But brows have ached for it, and souls toiled and striven?\"    Rejecting the Bible, you must either accept Deism or Atheism. Deism  admits the existence of a God of infinite power and intelligence. A  Deist need have no trouble in believing a miracle. The question with him  is not, can God work miracles, and thereby reveal himself to man, but  has he done it. Reason teaches us that intelligent design characterizes  every act of God. Which theory ascribes the more intelligence to  God--the Deist's or the Christian's?    It is universally conceded that man has a worshiping nature. This is  evinced by the almost universal idolatry of past ages. Would an act of  wisdom reveal to man the true object of worship? Man has a conscience  which smites him for his wrong doing, and approves him for his well  doing. Would wisdom and love tell him what is right? Or would such  attributes allow him to remain in ignorance of his duties? Man has a  desire for eternal life; would Deity prepare a place of happiness for  him and not reveal the fact to him, that he might better prepare for it,  and enjoy the hope of it? Man has a desire for the knowledge of his  origin, and for a knowledge of the attributes of his God; would an  intelligent being create him with these desires and refuse to gratify  them?    Surely there are some things in Deism hard to believe. Deism allows that  man has in his nature this empty bucket, which is not to be filled  during his stay in this world, _if it shall ever be_! Nor are these all  the hard things which Deists ask me to believe. He wishes me to believe  that the history of the Nazarene is legendary, that he was a fanatical  enthusiast. Some Deists have refused to believe so hard a thing as this.    Yet I am asked to believe, in addition to this, that he, Christ, \"has  become,\" as Renan says, \"the corner-stone of humanity so entirely, that  to tear his name from the world would be to rend it to its foundations.\"  I am asked, also, to believe, with Renan, the prince of Deists, that,  \"Whatever may be the surprises of the future, Jesus will never be  surpassed. His worship will grow young without ceasing; his legend will  call forth tears without end; his sufferings will melt the noblest  hearts; all ages will proclaim that among the sons of men there is none  born greater than Jesus.\" I am asked, with this same Renan, to \"place  the person of Jesus on the highest summit of human grandeur.\" Is it not  hard to believe all this about Jesus, and at the same time believe that  he gave to the world a false religion? Truly there are many things hard  to believe--\"_I can't see them!_\"    I can not believe that \"the passion of an hallucinated woman gave to the  world a resurrected God.\" I can not believe that his legend was the  fruit of a great, altogether spontaneous conspiracy. A conspiracy  implies conspirators; and I can not believe that the apostles were such  outrageous fools as to make a conspiracy, and work so zealously in it,  and cling so firmly to it, when it promised nothing but stripes,  imprisonments, hunger, nakedness, and death. Neither can I believe that  these unlearned Galilean fishermen had the ability in themselves to  concoct a conspiracy that would, and did, deceive nearly the whole  civilized world. Nor can I believe that an ignorant, deluded Nazarene  founded a religion that has held the attention of the thoughtful of all  ages. He that refuses to believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, along with  the claims of the Bible, has many more and greater difficulties in  accounting for the existence of Christianity. It is here, and its  existence is the greatest miracle man has ever witnessed. To deny its  divinity only increases its wonderfulness. We can not have an effect  without an adequate cause. It is hard to believe that humanity is an  adequate cause of Christianity. For eighteen centuries it has been  living and acting; persecuted by enemies without, and torn and betrayed  by enemies within; oppressed by government, and corrupted by Popes and  priests; shorn of its grandeur and glory by paganism; its spirituality  crippled by stripes and animosities; its fervid love and deep piety  replaced, to a great extent, by policy; its rites and ceremonies changed  by councils; yet, it continues a monumental proof of the divinity of its  glorious founder. Rescued from the wreck of the Dark Ages by Luther and  others, it commends itself more and more to every reflecting mind as the  only living religion of the present and future. Deliver me from the  credulity that believes that such a wonderful soul-redeeming institution  had its origin in the passion of a crazy woman or the conspiracy of a  few ignorant fishermen.          THE RESULT OF IGNORANCE, AS VIEWED FROM THE SKEPTIC'S STANDPOINT.      \"A singular forgetfulness is sometimes noticeable in quarters where one  would least expect it; that the education of an immature mind, and the  prosecution of a _scientific inquiry_, are two perfectly distinct  things; that the former requires faith, the latter skepticism; and that  while the former is the work of the church, the latter is the work of  individuals. Thus the Duke of Somerset goes to church, and finds an  ignorant generation _reposed in a paradise of illusions_, while its more  learned and thoughtful progeny _is excruciated with doubt_. In vain  preachers now exhort to faith. * * * The Protestant oftentimes takes up  his open Bible; he wishes to believe; he tries to believe. * * * All  these efforts avail nothing.\" _Christian Theology and Modern Skepticism,  1872, p. 144._    \"The Duke and the Protestant are simply trying to do two things at once;  and, naturally, Professor Huxley is tempted in the same direction.\" _Lay  Sermons, p. 21._ \"But then he is keen enough to suspect some absurdity  in the position, and honestly proclaims that the army of liberal thought  is, at present, in very loose order; and many a spirited freethinker  makes use of his freedom mainly to vent nonsense.\" _Lay Sermons, p. 69._    According to the above quotations, if it is wise to be skeptical, to be  ignorant is bliss.    Give me a \"_paradise of illusions_;\" let me _repose in them_; if I am  disappointed in the end I shall fare as well as the skeptic, with this  difference, that in case there is any hereafter, I shall know that in my  ignorance I lived a life of blessedness with reference to the _now_  experienced eternity; while, in case there is no hereafter for us, we  shall just be equal. Again I repeat it, let me have the side where I  take no risks when viewed from the skeptic's standpoint, and where I can  \"_repose in a paradise of illusions_,\" in preference to the _skeptic's  excruciating doubt_.    But we shall not be disappointed. Neither are we necessarily a  generation of immature minds. We are willing as a whole to compare with  non-church going people as a whole. And we are further conceded to be  the happiest people in the world, unless you can find a people happier  than those who \"_repose in a paradise of mental illusions_.\" Yes! But we  shall find in the end that it was neither ignorance nor illusion, but  the wisdom of the wise. Let us continue thus, _to live_.          EVOLUTION.    WHAT DO EVOLUTIONISTS TEACH?    DEDICATED TO C.F., DANVILLE, IND.      Many scientists who reject religion put on an air of superiority that is  repulsive. If you call their speculations in question you at once  receive credit for being an uneducated fool, a worshiper of the Bible.    Mr. Huxley advises"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28673"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#6)"],[1," universities and monasteries, as stated above. The first  dawnings of modern literature are seen in connection with the  cultivation of the language of Provence and the productions of the  Troubadours. The first great teacher in this connection was William,  Count of Poiton, a nobleman, distinguished by his powers in the  crusades. Many of the men of note who were in the crusades, were of his  character. Their writings upon the topics of war, gallantry, satire and  history, first roused Europe from her ignorance and lethargy, first  taught her to think and reflect and judge upon subjects of imagination.  The Troubadours sustained the middle place between Gothic ignorance and  Italian excellence, and literature is indebted to them for rearing the  first fruits of European genius and inspiring the moderns with the love  of poetry. Their influence and language spread over all the countries of  Europe. Their bards were in the courts of kings and the castles of  barons. The commencement of the crusades and the beginning of the  fifteenth century, mark the limits of their fame. Their romance had its  rise in the manners of chivalry, and fell into disrepute when chivalry  declined. In the fourteenth century men of intellectual genius in Italy  resolved to cultivate their own native language and to combine with its  grandeur the charms of imagination and the acquirements of classical  learning. The poetry of the Tuscan school, the works of Dante, Ariosto,  Boccio and Petrarch, have never yet been excelled by four succeeding  centuries of genius and literature. The way was open for the revival of  classical learning in the fifteenth century, and for the cultivation of  all the arts and sciences connected with its cultivation.    The downfall of the Roman Empire in the east and the discovery of the  art of printing happened about the same time. Scholars had long trembled  in view of the approach of Mahomet the second. Constantinople was  captured by the Turks in 1458; then Chrysoloras, Gaza of Thessalonica,  Demetrius Chalcondyles, Johannes Lascaris, Callistus, Constantius,  Johannes Andronicus, and many other learned Greeks, fled into Italy for  protection, where they found, at Florence, several Greek professors who  had been persuaded by Cosmo de Medici to settle in that city. They  settled in Florence and there interpreted the ancient writings which had  been kept in the eastern metropolis. The best Italian scholars fell in  with them and soon became enamored with the spirit of poetry, eloquence  and history. Here a better philosophy was soon taken up, and the cunning  of scholasticism, as known in the empty speculations of metaphysicians,  gave place to the more profitable principles of moral philosophy. The  study of the Greek language was introduced in England by William Grocyn,  a fellow of New College, Oxford, who died about the year 1520.    \"To the mechanical genius of Holland we must ascribe the discovery of  the art of printing, for the original inventor was Laurentius John  Coster, of Haerlem, who made his first essay with wooden types about the  year 1430. The art was communicated by his servant to John Faust and  John Guttenberg, of Mentz. It was carried to perfection by Peter  Shoeffer, the son-in-law of Faustus, who invented the modes of casting  metal types.\"    Trihemius, in his Chronicle, written A.D. 1514, says he had it from the  mouth of Peter Shoeffer that the first book they printed with movable  types was the Bible, about the year 1450, in which the expenses were so  great that 4,000 florins were expended before they completed twelve  sheets. The author of a manuscript, Chronicle of Cologne, compiled in  1499, also says that he was told by Ulric Zell, of Cologne, who himself  introduced printing there in 1466, that the Latin Bible was first begun  to be printed in the year of Jubilee, 1450, and that it was in large  type. Mr. Edwards, of Pall Mall possessed a copy of this curious Bible  in three volumes, bound in morocco. In his catalogue it was valued at  L126. There, is a beautiful copy of this work in the Bodleian (or  Bodleyan) Library in the University at Oxford.    The art of printing soon spread over the greater part of Europe, and  to-day our world is a world of books, and the love of the Bible was the  origin of printing.          COUNCILS.    UNITY OF ROMAN CHURCH.      The Council of Nice assembled in Asia Minor by the direction of  Constantine in the year 325. Here we see more than two hundred and fifty  bishops, mostly from the east, with presbyters, deacons and others,  engaged in an effort to settle the Arian heresy, which consisted in  maintaining that Christ was the most exalted of all created things, but  inferior to God the Father. This opinion was first ventilated in the  year 318. It was publicly condemned by the Council of Alexandria in the  year 320, and then by the Council of Nice. This Council maintained the  perfect equality of essence of both Father and Son, and could only  express their relation by terming it eternal generation, which Dr. Adam  Clark calls eternal nonsense.    \"Arius and his partisans were banished by the Council of Alexandria, but  as he had powerful adherents he found means to return at the express  command of Constantine. He was on his way to receive the oath of  ministerial allegiance when he very suddenly, as some say, died by  poison. His death was in the year 336. It is said that Constantine was  baptized into the Arian communion in the year 337. The followers of  Arius increased greatly after his death. Under Constantius, called  _Flavius Julius_, Arianism became the religion of the court, and it even  penetrated as far as Rome, which was obliged to receive into its  communion Felix, an Arian bishop. But the divisions which grew among the  Arians themselves prepared for the Catholic church an easy victory over  them and led to their final extinction.\" It is worthy of being  remembered at all times, and under all circumstances, that this whole  controversy is unauthorized in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, faith in him  as the Son of the living God being the great truth upon which the Church  of God is built. What eternal nonsense it is to be quarreling about  whether he and his Father are of the same essence. The truths of  Christianity and of Protestantism are found in the teachings of the  anti-Nicene fathers, but we must remember that these were uninspired  men, and therefore displayed no _standard_ of truth. The term fathers,  without qualification, includes a vast range, comprising a period of  eleven hundred years, from Clemens to Bernard, from the Bishop of Rome  to the Monk of Clairvaux.    Immediately after the Council of Nice their works took on the infections  of popery. Each succeeding writer in each succeeding century added to  the gathering mass of error and superstition. The filth and dirt  accumulated until the system of delusion was fully developed in the \"man  of sin.\" The Fathers, as they are called, are entitled to no more than  other men. They should never be resorted to as authoritative or  inspired, for they were not. They may be used as witnesses to show the  customs of their times. So far as they are concerned as _the standard_  of truth, we may just as well, with safety and without remorse, deliver  them to the Vatican to rot with the lumber and legends of the dark ages.  The anti-Nicene fathers had many errors, but theirs were not the errors  of Romanism. The religious productions of the first three centuries of  our era contain, in the main, the principles of Protestantism. The  post-Nicene fathers, or popery, may be compared to a field of wheat  overrun with weeds. The great work of the Protestant reformers was to  eradicate the weeds. Failing to accomplish this in the Roman field, they  gathered the pure seed grain and sowed it in the Lord's field, \"the  world,\" where it now waves in beauty, tending to a glorious harvest.  Once on a time a person was asked where Protestantism was before the  Reformation. He answered in turn, It was where your face was this  morning before it was washed. The reply was just. Dirt could be no part  of the human countenance, and removing the filth by washing could  neither change the features of the face nor destroy its identity. By  this cleansing operation the face only assumed its normal and natural  appearance. In like manner the superstitious traditions of the Roman  church were no part of Christianity. It was but proper that the  reformers should dismiss the adulterations of the ages and plant their  feet away back in the land of Israel with the Christ of God.    Arius was regarded as an innovater on the true faith. The great enemy of  Arianism was simply Trinitarianism. The council of Nice was presided  over by Hosius. The assembled fathers declared the consubstantiality of  the son for the establishment of Trinitarianism and the extermination of  Arianism. This wonderful term, _consubstantiality_, had been rejected by  the synod of Antioch sixty years before, and by Dionysius, of  Alexandria, in opposition to Sabellianism.    In 359 the Emperor Constantius assembled the council of Rimini, a city  of Central Italy. Six hundred bishops and a number of priests now undo  all that the council of Nice had done. This council was as accommodating  to Arian Constantius as to the Trinitarian Constantine. Constantius,  forsaking the Trinitarian system, adopted Arianism, and Greeks and  Latins complied with the imperial wishes, and, like dutiful subjects,  signed the Arian and semi-Arian confessions of Sirneium, Seleucia, Milan  and Ariminum. The western and eastern prelacy subscribed in compliance  with their sovereign to the Arian creed, which, as Du Pin has shown, was  signed by his infallibility, Pope Liberius.    Next in our programme comes Theodosius I., assembling a council of one  hundred and fifty bishops at Constantinople in the year 381. Theodosius  was a zealous Catholic; he"]]]
