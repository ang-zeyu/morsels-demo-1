[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#6)"],[1," me the  only excuses for rubber. Trout fishing is more comfortable in woolen  than in waders. The latter are clumsy and hot. I have known of two  instances of drowning because the victims were weighted down by them.  And I should much prefer getting wet from without than from within.    You will have your choice of three kinds of moccasin--the oil-tanned  shoe pac, the deerhide, and the moosehide.    [Sidenote: Shoe Pacs]    The shoe pac is about as waterproof as the average waterproof shoe, and  would be the best for all purposes were it not for the fact that its  very imperviosity renders it too hot. In addition continuous wear  affects the oil in the tanning process to produce rather an evil odor.  The shoe pacs are very useful, however, and where I carry but two pairs  of moccasins, one is of the oil tan. Shoe pacs can be purchased of any  sporting goods dealer.    [Sidenote: Moccasins]    The deerhide moccasin, in spite of its thinner texture, wears about as  well as the moosehide, is less bulky to carry, but stretches more when  wet and is not as easy on the feet. I use either sort as I happen to get  hold of them. Genuine buckskin or moose is rather scarce. Commercial  moccasins with the porcupine quills and \"Souvenir of Mackinaw\" on them  are made by machinery out of sheepskin. They are absolutely useless, and  last about long enough to get out of sight of the shop. A great majority  of the moccasins sold as sportsman's supplies are likewise very bogus.  My own wear I have always purchased of Hudson's Bay posts. Undoubtedly  many reliable firms carry them; but I happen to know by personal  experience that the Putman Boot Company of Minneapolis have the real  thing.    [Sidenote: Waistcoats]    Proceeding to more outer garments, a waistcoat is a handy affair. In  warm weather you leave it open and hardly know you have it on; in cold  weather you button it up, and it affords excellent protection. Likewise  it possesses the advantage of numerous pockets. These you will have your  women folk extend and deepen for you, until your compass, notebook,  pipe, matches, and so forth fit nicely in them. As it is to be used as  an outside garment, have the back lined. If you have shot enough deer to  get around to waistcoats, nothing could be better by way of material  than the ever-useful buckskin.    [Sidenote: Waterproofs]    I am no believer in waterproof garments. Once I owned a pantasote outer  coat which I used to assume whenever it rained. Ordinarily when it is  warm enough to rain, it is warm enough to cause you to perspire under  the exertion of walking in a pantasote coat. This I discovered. Shortly  I would get wet, and would be quite unable to decide whether the rain  had soaked through from the outside or I had soaked through from the  inside. After that I gave the coat away to a man who had not tried it,  and was happy. If I must walk in the rain I prefer to put on a  sweater--the rough wool of which will turn water for some time and the  texture of which allows ventilation. Then the chances are that even if I  soak through I do not get a reactionary chill from becoming overheated.    [Sidenote: Ponchos]    In camp you will know enough to go in when it rains. When you have to  sally forth you will thrust your head through the hole in the middle of  your rubber blanket. When thus equipped the rubber blanket is known as a  poncho, and is most useful because it can be used for two purposes.    [Sidenote: Slickers]    Horseback in a rainy country is, however, a different matter. There  transportation is not on your back, but another's; and sitting a horse  is not violent exercise. Some people like a poncho. I have always found  its lower edge cold, clumsy, and wet, much inclined to blow about, and  apt to soak your knees and the seat of your saddle. The cowboy slicker  cannot be improved upon. It is different in build from the ordinary  oilskin. Call for a \"pommel slicker,\" and be sure it is apparently  about two sizes too large for you. Thus you will cover your legs. Should  you be forced to walk, a belt around your waist will always enable you  to tuck it up like a comic opera king. It is sure ludicrous to view, but  that does not matter.    [Sidenote: Chaparejos]    Apropos of protecting your legs, there remains still the question of  chaparejos or chaps. Unless you are likely to be called on to ride at  some speed through thorny brush, or unless you expect to ride very wet  indeed, they are a useless affectation. The cowboy needs them because he  does a great deal of riding of the two kinds just mentioned. Probably  you will not. I have had perhaps a dozen occasions to put them on. If  you must have them, get either oil-tanned or hair chaps. Either of these  sheds water like a tin roof. The hair chaps will not last long in a  thorny country.    [Sidenote: Gloves]    You will need furthermore a pair of gloves of some sort, not for  constant wear, nor merely for warmth, but to protect you in the  handling of pack ropes, lead ropes, and cooking utensils. A good  buckskin gauntlet is serviceable, as the cuffs keep the cold breezes  from playing along your forearm to your shoulder, and exclude the dust.  When you can get hold of the army gauntlet, as you sometimes can in the  military stores, buy them. Lacking genuine buckskin, the lighter grades  of \"asbestos\" yellow tan are the best. They cost about two dollars. To  my notion a better rig is an ordinary pair of short gloves, supplemented  by the close-fitting leather cuffs of a cowboy's outfit. The latter hold  the wrist snugly, exclude absolutely chill and dirt, and in addition  save wear and soiling of the shirt cuff. They do not pick up twigs,  leaves, and rubbish funnel wise, as a gauntlet cuff is apt to do.    That, I think, completes your wearing apparel. Let us now take up the  contents of your pockets, and your other personal belongings.      _SUMMARY_              _Minimum for comfort_              Felt hat            Silk kerchief            Waistcoat            Buckskin shirt or sweater            Gray flannel shirt            2 undershirts and drawers            Trousers--buckskin over khaki            3 pairs heavy socks            {3 pairs moccasins            {      or            {1 pair boots            {1 pair moccasins            Gloves and leather cuffs                _Maximum_              Felt hat            Silk kerchief            Waistcoat            Buckskin shirt and sweater            Gray flannel shirt            2 undershirts, 3 drawers (includes one suit you wear)            Trousers            4 pairs socks            1 pair boots            Moccasins            Slicker            Gloves and leather cuffs          CHAPTER IV    PERSONAL EQUIPMENT    (_Continued_)      [Sidenote: Matches]    MATCHES, knife, and a compass are the three indispensables. By way of  ignition you will take a decided step backward from present-day  civilization in that you will pin your faith to the old sulphur  \"eight-day\" matches of your fathers. This for several reasons. In the  first place they come in blocks, unseparated, which are easily carried  without danger of rubbing one against the other. In the second place,  they take up about a third the room the same number of wooden matches  would require. In the third place, they are easier to light in a wind,  for they do not flash up and out, but persist. And finally, if wet, they  can be spread out and dried in the sun, which is the most important of  all. So buy you a nickel's worth of sulphur matches.    [Illustration: One of the mishaps to be expected]    [Sidenote: Match Safes]    The main supply you will pack in some sort of waterproof receptacle. I  read a story recently in which a man was recognized as a true woodsman  because he carried his matches in a bottle. He must have had good luck.  The cardinal principle of packing is never to carry any glassware.  Ninety and nine days it may pass safely, but the hundredth will smash it  as sure as some people's shooting. And then you have jam, or chili  powder, or syrup, or whiskey, all over the place--or else no matches.  Any good screw top can--or better still, two telescoping tubes--is  infinitely better.    The day's supply you will put in your pocket. A portion can go in a  small waterproof match safe; but as it is a tremendous nuisance to be  opening such a contrivance every time you want a smoke, I should advise  you to stick a block in your waistcoat pocket, where you can get at them  easily. If you are going a-wading, and pockets are precarious, you will  find your hat band handy.    The waterproof pocket safe is numerous on the market. A ten-gauge brass  shell will just chamber a twelve-gauge. Put your matches in the  twelve-gauge, and telescope the ten over it. Abercrombie & Fitch, of New  York, make a screw top safe of rubber, which has the great advantage of  floating if dropped, but it is too bulky and the edges are too sharp.  The Marble safe, made by the Marble Axe Company, is ingenious and  certainly waterproof; but if it gets bent in the slightest degree, it  jams, and you can no longer screw it shut. Therefore I consider it  useless for this reason. A very convenient and cheap emergency  contrivance is the flint and steel pocket cigar lighter to be had at  most cigar stores. With it as a reserve you are sure of a fire no matter  how wet the catastrophe.    [Sidenote: Knives]    Your knife should be a medium size two-bladed affair, of the best  quality. Do not get it too large and heavy. You can skin and quarter a  deer with an ordinary jackknife. Avoid the \"kit\" knives. They are  mighty handy contraptions. I owned one with two blades, a thoroughly  practicable can opener, an awl or punch, a combined reamer, nail pull  and screwdriver, and a corkscrew. It was a delight for as long as it  lasted. The trouble with such knives is that they are too round, so that  sooner or later they are absolutely certain to roll out of your "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32958"],[0,"Edge Hill: The Battle and Battlefield; With Notes on Banbury & Thereabout (#6)"],[1," have under his hand. It had been a strange thing if my  brother that shewed so much courage at _Worcester_, should have been so  faint-hearted on this occasion; But I strange that men will give credit to  every idle fellow; if they will, they may heare that my Lord Generall and  all the Officers, every one of them ran away. But my Lord, as your  Lordship hath great cause to be thankfull, together with us, to God, that  in all these late actions of danger, hath preserved the persons and lives  of all your three Sons, so also for preserving their honors, and the honor  of Religion; that in this cause they have never flinsht, but have all of  them in their severall places and conditions been as forward to hazard  their persons into the midst of their's and God's enemies as any whosever.  And of the truth of this (though we do not vapour so much as some do)  there are enough, and those very honorable witnesses that can and will  affirm it as well as    _Your Lordship's most obedient Son_,    NATHANIEL FIENNES.          A most true Relation of the Battell fought by his Excellency and his  Forces against the bloudy Cavalliers.    The two and twentieth of _October_, being _Saturday_, his Excellency the  Earl of _Essex_ came with twelve regiments of Foot, and two and forty  Troops of Horse, and a part of the Ammunition and Artillery, to _Keynton_,  a little Market Toun, almost in the mid-way between _Stratford_ upon the  Avon, and _Banbury_, there being three Regiments of Foot, and nine or ten  Troops of Horse, with seven Pieces of Cannon, and good store of Ammunition  coming after, together with six Companies of Dragooners; the Dragooners,  and two of the Regiments of Foot, with the Cannon, and nine or ten Troops  of Horse, came to _Keynton_ on _Sunday_ night, a little before the day  went down; The Regiment, with the Lord Rochfords, came not into the Army  till Monday in the afternoon. The King's Army was lodged on Saturday  night, about Croprede and Edgecot, some 6 or 7 miles from _Keynton_; and  having, no doubt, got intelligence that part of our Army, and Artillery,  with a great part of our Ammunition was behinde us, they thought they  could not have a better opportunity to fight with our Army, especially if  they could get the advantage of the hill before us, it being a very high  and steep assent, which if they were put to the worst might serve them for  a Retreat, as it did, it being that which saved them, their Carriages, and  the Colours of their Regiments of Foot that ran away; for of those that  fought it out, we tooke most of them, excepting onely those two Regiments  that stood it out till night, and went off with their horse in an orderly  way. The enemy having resolved to give us Battell, and no whit doubting of  the Victory, they being more then we were, both in horse and foot (a  considerable Brigado of our Army being behinde) and having a great opinion  of the resolution of their Souldiers, wherein they were partly deceived,  and partly not, as it hapned also on our side; They returned back towards  _Edge Hill_, and made all possible speed to gain the hill before us (which  they did, by reason that his Excellency had not timely intelligence of  their designe, otherwise we were much neerer the hill, and might have been  possessed of it before them). And by that time our Army was drawn out of  the Town about a mile and half towards the hill, the Dragooners, and some  of the enemie's Foot were coming down the hill; Their horse having gotten  down most of them on their right hand, and placed themselves in a fair  Meadow, at the bottom of the hill; Their Cannon and Ammunition, with the  Rere of their foot, were something long ere they came down. And if we had  charged them before their Cannon and all their Foot were come down, we  might have had a great advantage: but they got all down into the Meadow at  the foot of the hill, and there drew up their Army very handsomely, their  horse being on their right Wing for the most part, and their Dragooners,  and some few Troops of horse on their left Wing; some of their prisoners  said they had four Regiments of horse on that wing also; but I could never  speak with any of our Army, that either saw any such number of horse, or  could tell what they did, unlesse they went directly to _Keynton_, to  plunder the Carriages without charging our Army at all.    For our Army, it was drawn up upon a little rising ground, and being  amongst the horse, I could not well discern how the foot were drawn up;  only I knew they were most of them a good space behinde the horse, when we  began to charge: but for the horse, there were three Regiments on the  right Wing of our Army, _viz._, The Lord Generalls Regiment commanded by  Sir _Philip Stapleton_; Sir _William Belfore's_ Regiment, Lieutenant  Generall of the Horse; and the Lord _Fielding's_ Regiment, which stood  behinde the other two, in the way of a reserve.    On the right Wing of our Army, was Sir James Ramsey, with some 24 Troops,  for many of our Troops were not in the Field that day. The Armies being  thus placed one against another with no great oddes of the winde or ground  (but what their was of winde the enemies had it, the ground being  reasonable indifferent on both sides) after many shot of Cannon which did  very little hurt amongst us, and very much amongst them, their foot  advancing for the most part against our right Wing, and their horse  against the left Wing of our Army. Their horse had the better of our horse  that were on our left Wing, and routing them, drove them back upon our  foot, and amongst the rest, upon Colonell _Hollis_ his Regiment, which was  in the Rere, and they brake through it, yet they ran not away, nor seemed  to be at all dismayed at it; but four other Regiments ran away, and fought  not at all, and many of them cast away their Colours, and so the enemy  took them up, having scarce got so much as one Colour or Cornet of those  Regiments or Troops that fought, whereas all the Colours that we got from  them, and the King's Standard, which we had a long time in our possession,  were taken out of the midst of their best Regiments that fought it out  very resolutely: Our left Wing being thus put to the worst, the day was  very desperate on our side; and had not God clearly fought for us, we had  lost it; for had the enemie's horse when they routed the left Wing, fallen  upon the Rere of our right Wing, in all probability the army had been  wholly defeated: But they made directly to the Town, and there falling  upon our Carriages, most barbarously massacred a number of poor Waggoners  and Carters that had no arms to defend themselves, and so fell to  pillaging and pursuing those that ran away, so long till they met with  Colonell _Hampden_, who with the other Brigado of the Army (which came  with the Artillery and Ammunition which was behinde) was by this time come  near to _Keynton_, and the enemie's Troops falling upon him as they  pursued our men that ran away, he gave them a stop, and discharging five  pieces of Cannon against them, he slew some of them; whereupon they  returned in some fear and disorder: But when they came back into the  Field, they found all their Infantry, excepting two Regiments, cut in  pieces or defeated and run away; for it pleased God to put such courage  into four or five of our Regiments of foot, and two Regiments of horse,  the Lord Generall's commanded by Sir _Philip Stapleton_, and Sir _William  Belfore_, that they defeated all their Regiments of foot, except two. Sir  _William Belfore's_ Regiment of horse charged a Regiment of the enemie's  foot, before any foot came up to assist him, and breaking into it cut most  of it off; and after, by the assistance of some of our foot, he defeated  another Regiment, and so we got up to the greatest part of the enemies  Ordnance, and took them, cutting off the Geers of the horses that drew  them, and killing the Gunners under the Carriages, but were forced to  leave them without any to guard them, by reason we were fain to make good  the day against severall Regiments of foot that still fought with a good  deal of resolution; especially that which was of the King's Guard, where  his Standard was, close by which Sir _William Belfore's_ Regiment rode  when they came from taking the Ordnance; and they taking us to be their  friends, and we them, some of our Company, shook hands with some of them,  which was the cause that after riding up towards the Lord Generall's  Regiment of horse, they gave fire upon Sir _William Belfore's_ Regiment,  and discerning each other to be friends, we joyned Companies; and so with  half the Lord Generall's Regiment, which his Excellency himself led up,  charging the King's Regiment, we defeated it, took the Standard, took the  Generall of the King's Army, the Earl of Lindley, and his son, and  Colonell Vavasor who was Lieutenant Colonell of that Regiment, and killed  Sir Edward Varney upon the place (who carryed the Standard), Colonell John  Munroe, and divers others: In this charge, and generally throughout the  day, the Lord Generall's Troop, consisting most of Gentlemen, carried  themselves most valiantly; and had all our Troops, of our left Wing been  made of the same metall, the enemy had not made so easie an impression  into them. And what is said of my Lord Generall's Troop, may most truly,  and to his high praise, be said of himself; and also that noble Earl, the  Earl of Bedford, Generall of the horse, for both of them rode all day,  being in the heads of the severall Troops and Regiments to give their  directions, and to bring them on upon the enemy, hazarding their persons  as far and further than any particular Souldier in the Army. By this time  all the enemie's foot being dispersed and gone excepting two Regiments,  they retiring themselves, found their Ordnance behind them without any  Guard, and there they made a stand, and made use of their Cannon, shooting  divers"]]]
