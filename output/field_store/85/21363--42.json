The  spreading of that white tablecloth for the first time was a real  religious ceremony, and the hard workers gave thanks to the All-father  for His blessing on their every effort.    One year afterward a new event brought joy; there entered happily into  their happy house a little girl, and all the prairie smiled about them.  Surely their boat was well beyond the breakers.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    But right in the sunshine of their joy the trouble cloud arose to block  the sky. Old man Cree was missing one day. His son rode long and far on  the range for two hard days before he sighted a grazing pony, and down a  rocky hollow near, found his father, battered and weak, near death, with  a broken leg and a gash in his head.    He could only gasp \"Water\" as Josh hurried up, and the boy rushed off to  fill his hat at the nearest stream.    [Illustration]    They had no talk, for the father swooned after drinking, and Josh had to  face the situation; but he was Western trained. He stripped himself of  all spare clothing, and his father's horse of its saddle blanket; then,  straightening out the sick man, he wrapped him in the clothes and  blanket, and rode like mad for the nearest ranch-house. The neighbour, a  young man, came at once, with a pot to make tea, an axe, and a rope.  They found the older Cree conscious but despairing. A fire was made, and  hot tea revived him. Then Josh cut two long poles from the nearest  timber and made a stretcher, or travois, Indian fashion, the upper ends  fast to the saddle of a horse, while the other ends trailed on the  ground. Thus by a long, slow journey the wounded man got back. All he  had prayed for was to get home. Every invalid is sure that if only he  can get home all will soon be well. Mother was not yet strong, the baby  needed much care, but Josh was a good boy, and the loving best of all  was done for the sick one. His leg, set by the army surgeon of Fort  Yellowstone, was knit again after a month, but had no power. He had no  force; the shock of those two dire days was on him. The second month  went by, and still he lay in bed. Poor Josh was the man of the place  now, and between duties, indoors and out, he was worn body and soul.    Then it was clear they must have help. So Jack S---- was engaged at the  regular wages of $40 a month for outside work, and a year of struggle  went by, only to see John Cree in his grave, his cattle nearly all gone,  his widow and boy living in a house on which was still $500 of the  original mortgage. Josh was a brave boy and growing strong, but  unboyishly grave with the weight of care. He sold off the few cattle  that were left, and set about keeping the roof over his mother and baby  sister by working a truck farm for the market supplied by the summer  hotels of the Park, and managed to come out even. He would in time have  done well, but he could not get far enough ahead to meet that 10 per  cent mortgage already overdue.    The banker was not a hard man, but he was in the business for the  business. He extended the time, and waited for interest again and again,  but it only made the principal larger, and it seemed that the last ditch  was reached, that it would be best to let the money-man foreclose,  though that must mean a wipe-out and would leave the fatherless family  homeless.    [Illustration]    Winter was coming on, work was scarce, and Josh went to Gardiner to see  what he could get in the way of house or wage. He learned of a chance to  'substitute' for the Park mail-carrier, who had sprained his foot. It  was an easy drive to Fort Yellowstone, and there he readily agreed, when  they asked him, to take the letters and packages and go on farther to  the Canyon Hotel. Thus it was that on the 20th day of November 189--,  Josh Cree, sixteen years old, tall and ruddy, rode through the snow to  the kitchen door of the Canyon Hotel and was welcomed as though he were  old Santa Claus himself.    [Illustration]    Two Magpies on a tree were among the onlookers. The Park Bears were  denned up, but there were other fur-bearers about. High on the wood-pile  sat a Yellow Red Fox in a magnificent coat. Another was in front of the  house, and the keeper said that as many as a dozen came some days. And  sometimes, he said, there also came a wonderful Silver Fox, a size  bigger than the rest, black as coal, with eyes like yellow diamonds, and  a silver frosting like little stars on his midnight fur.    \"My! but he's a beauty. That skin would buy the best team of mules on  the Yellowstone.\" That was interesting and furnished talk for a while.  In the morning when they were rising for their candlelight breakfast,  the hotel man glancing from the window exclaimed, \"Here he is now!\" and  Josh peered forth to see in the light of sunrise something he had often  heard of, but never before seen, a coal-black Fox, a giant among his  kind. How slick and elegant his glossy fur, how slim his legs, and what  a monstrous bushy tail; and the other Foxes moved aside as the patrician  rushed in impatient haste to seize the food thrown out by the cook.    \"Ain't he a beauty?\" said the hotel man. \"I'll bet that pelt would fetch  five hundred.\"    Oh, why did he say \"five hundred,\" the exact sum, for then it was that  the tempter entered into Josh Cree's heart. Five hundred dollars! just  the amount of the mortgage. \"Who owns wild beasts? The man that kills  them,\" said the tempter, and the thought was a live one in his breast as  Josh rode back to Fort Yellowstone.    [Illustration]    At Gardiner he received his pay, $6, for three days' work and, turning  it into groceries, set out for the poor home that soon would be lost to  him, and as he rode he did some hard and gloomy thinking. On his wrist  there hung a wonderful Indian quirt of plaited rawhide and horsehair  with beads on the shaft, and a band of Elk teeth on the butt. It was a  pet of his, and \"good medicine,\" for a flat piece of elkhorn let in the  middle was perforated with a hole, through which the distant landscape  was seen much clearer--a well-known law, an ancient trick, but it made  the quirt prized as a thing of rare virtue, and Josh had refused good  offers for it. Then a figure afoot was seen, and coming nearer, it  turned out to be a friend, Jack Day, out a-gunning with a .22 rifle. But  game was scarce and Jack was returning to Gardiner empty-handed and  disgusted. They stopped for a moment's greeting when Day said: \"Huntin's  played out now. How'll you swap that quirt for my rifle?\" A month before  Josh would have scorned the offer. A ten-dollar quirt for a five-dollar  rifle, but now he said briefly: \"For rifle with cover, tools and  ammunition complete, I'll go ye.\" So the deal was made and in an hour  Josh was home. He stabled Grizzle, the last of their saddle stock, and  entered.    [Illustration]    Love and sorrow dwelt in the widow's home, but the return of Josh  brought its measure of joy. Mother prepared the regular meal of tea,  potatoes, and salt pork; there was a time when they had soared as high  as canned goods, but those prosperous days were gone. Josh was dandling  baby sister on his lap as he told of his trip, and he learned of two  things of interest: First, the bank must have its money by February;  second, the stable at Gardiner wanted a driver for the Cook City stage.  Then the little events moved quickly. His half-formed plan of getting  back to the Canyon was now frustrated by the new opening, and, besides  this, hope had been dampened by the casual word of one who reported that  \"that Silver Fox had not been seen since at the Canyon.\"    Then began long days of dreary driving through the snow, with a noon  halt at Yancey's and then three days later the return, in the cold, the  biting cold. It was freezing work, but coldest of all was the chill  thought at his heart that February 1st would see him homeless.    [Illustration]    Small bands of Mountain Sheep he saw at times on the slope of Evarts,  and a few Blacktail, and later, when the winter deepened, huge bull Elk  were seen along the trail. Sometimes they moved not more than a few  paces to let him pass. These were everyday things to him, but in the  second week of his winter work he got a sudden thrill. He was coming  down the long hill back of Yancey's when what should he see there,  sitting on its tail, shiny black with yellow eyes like a huge black cat  unusually long and sharp in the nose, but a wonderful Silver Fox!  Possibly the same as the one he saw at the Canyon, for that one he knew  had disappeared and there were not likely to be two in the Park. Yes, it  might be the same, and Josh's bosom surged with mingled feelings. Why  did he not carry that little gun? Why did he not realize? Were the  thoughts that came--$500! A noble chance! broad daylight only  twenty-five yards! and gone!    The Fox was still there when Josh drove on. On the next trip he brought  the little rifle. He had sawed off the stock so he could hide it easily  in his overcoat if need be. No man knew that he carried arms, but the  Foxes seemed to know. The Red ones kept afar and the Black one came no  more. Day after day he drove and hoped but the Black Fox has cunning  measured to his value. He came not, or if he came, was wisely hidden,  and so the month went by, till late in the cold Moon of Snow he heard  old Yancey, say \"There's a Silver Fox bin a-hanging around the stable  this last week. Leastwise Dave says he seen him.\" There were soldiers  sitting around that stove, game guardians of the Park, and still more  dangerous, a scout, the soldiers' guide, a mountaineer. Josh turned not  an inch, he made no sound in response, but his heart gave a jump.

In order to manifest Himself, in order to create, that is,  disclose Himself by means of emanations, He contracts, thus producing  vacant space. The _En-Sof_ first manifested itself in the prototype of  the whole of creation, in the macrocosm called the \"son of God,\" the  first man, as he appears upon the chariot of Ezekiel. From this  primitive man the whole created world emanates in four stages: _Azila_,  _Beria_, _Yezira_, _Asiya_. The _Azila_ emanation represents the active  qualities of primitive man. They are forces or intelligences flowing  from him, at once his essential qualities and the faculties by which he  acts. There are ten of these forces, forming the ten sacred _Sefiroth_,  a word which first meaning number came to stand for sphere. The first  three _Sefiroth_ are intelligences, the seven others, attributes. They  are supposed to follow each other in this order: 1. _Kether_ (crown); 2.  _Chochma_ (wisdom); 3. _Beena_ (understanding); 4. _Chesed_ (grace), or  _Ghedulla_ (greatness); 5. _Ghevoora_ (dignity); 6. _Tifereth_  (splendor); 7. _Nezach_ (victory); 8. _Hod_ (majesty); 9. _Yesod_  (principle); 10. _Malchuth_ (kingdom). From this first world of the  _Azila_ emanate the three other worlds, _Asiya_ being the lowest stage.  Man has part in these three worlds; a microcosm, he realizes in his  actual being what is foreshadowed by the ideal, primitive man. He holds  to the _Asiya_ by his vital part (_Nefesh_), to the _Yezira_ by his  intellect (_Ruach_), to the _Beria_ by his soul (_Neshama_). The last is  his immortal part, a spark of divinity.    Speculations like these, followed to their logical issue, are bound to  lead the investigator out of Judaism into Trinitarianism or Pantheism.  Kabbalists, of course only in rare cases, realized the danger. The sad  conditions prevailing in the era after the expulsion from Spain, a third  exile, were in all respects calculated to promote the development of  mysticism, and it did flourish luxuriantly.    Some few philosophers, the last of a long line, still await mention:  Levi ben Gerson, Joseph Kaspi, Moses of Narbonne in southern France,  long a seat of Jewish learning; then, Isaac ben Sheshet, Chasdai  Crescas, whose \"Light of God\" exercised deep influence upon Spinoza and  his philosophy; the Duran family, particularly Profiat Duran, successful  defender of Judaism against the attacks of apostates and Christians; and  Joseph Albo, who in his principal philosophic work, _Ikkarim_, shows  Judaism to be based upon three fundamental doctrines: the belief in the  existence of God, Revelation, and the belief in future reward and  punishment. These writers are the last to reflect the glories of the  golden age.    At the entrance to the next period we again meet a man of extraordinary  ability, Isaac Abrabanel, one of the most eminent and esteemed of Bible  commentators, in early life minister to a Catholic king, later on a  pilgrim scholar wandering about exiled with his sons, one of whom,  Yehuda, has fame as the author of the _Dialoghi di Amore_. In the train  of exiles passing from Portugal to the Orient are Abraham Zacuto, an  eminent historian of Jewish literature and sometime professor of  astronomy at the university of Salamanca; Joseph ibn Verga, the  historian of his nation; Amatus Lusitanus, who came close upon the  discovery of the circulation of the blood; Israel Nagara, the most  gifted poet of the century, whose hymns brought him popular favor;  later, Joseph Karo, \"the most influential personage of the sixteenth  century,\" his claims upon recognition resting on the _Shulchan Aruch_,  an exhaustive codex of Jewish customs and laws; and many others. In  Salonica, the exiles soon formed a prosperous community, where  flourished Jacob ibn Chabib, the first compiler of the Haggadistic tales  of the Talmud, and afterwards David Conforte, a reputable historian. In  Jerusalem, Obadiah Bertinoro was engaged on his celebrated Mishna  commentary, in the midst of a large circle of Kabbalists, of whom  Solomon Alkabez is the best known on account of his famous Sabbath song,  _Lecho Dodi_. Once again Jerusalem was the objective point of many  pilgrims, lured thither by the prevalent Kabbalistic and Messianic  vagaries. True literature gained little from such extremists. The only  work produced by them that can be admitted to have literary qualities is  Isaiah Hurwitz's \"The Two Tables of the Testimony,\" even at this day  enjoying celebrity. It is a sort of cyclopaedia of Jewish learning,  compiled and expounded from a mystic's point of view.    The condition of the Jews in Italy was favorable, and their literary  products derive grace from their good fortune. The Renaissance had a  benign effect upon them, and the revival of classical studies influenced  their intellectual work. Greek thought met Jewish a third time. Learning  was enjoying its resurrection, and whenever their wretched political  and social condition was not a hindrance, the Jews joined in the  general delight. Their misery, however, was an undiminishing burden,  yea, even in the days in which, according to Erasmus, it was joy to  live. In fact, it was growing heavier. All the more noteworthy is it  that Hebrew studies engaged the research of scholars, albeit they showed  care for the word of God, and not for His people. Pico della Mirandola  studies the Kabbala; the Jewish grammarian Elias Levita is the teacher  of Cardinal Egidio de Viterbo, and later of Paul Fagius and Sebastian  Muenster, the latter translating his teacher's works into Latin; popes  and sultans prefer Jews as their physicians in ordinary, who, as a rule,  are men of literary distinction; the Jews translate philosophic writings  from Hebrew and Arabic into Latin; Elias del Medigo is summoned as  arbiter in the scholastic conflict at the University of Padua;--all  boots nothing, ruin is not averted. Reuchlin may protest as he will, the  Jew is exiled, the Talmud burnt.    In such dreary days the Portuguese Samuel Usque writes his work,  _Consolacam as Tribulacoes de Ysrael_, and Joseph Cohen, his chronicle,  \"The Vale of Weeping,\" the most important history produced since the day  of Flavius Josephus,--additional proofs that the race possesses native  buoyancy, and undaunted heroism in enduring suffering. Women, too, in  increasing number, participate in the spiritual work of their nation;  among them, Deborah Ascarelli and Sara Copia Sullam, the most  distinguished of a long array of names.    The keen critic and scholar, Azariah de Rossi, is one of the literary  giants of his period. His researches in the history of Jewish literature  are the basis upon which subsequent work in this department rests, and  many of his conclusions still stand unassailable. About him are grouped  Abraham de Portaleone, an excellent archaeologist, who established that  Jews had been the first to observe the medicinal uses of gold; David de  Pomis, the author of a famous defense of Jewish physicians; and Leo de  Modena, the rabbi of Venice, \"unstable as water,\" wavering between faith  and unbelief, and, Kabbalist and rabbi though he was, writing works  against the Kabbala on the one hand, and against rabbinical tradition on  the other. Similar to him in character is Joseph del Medigo, an  itinerant author, who sometimes reviles, sometimes extols, the Kabbala.    There are men of higher calibre, as, for instance, Isaac Aboab, whose  _Nomologia_ undertakes to defend Jewish tradition against every sort of  assailant; Samuel Aboab, a great Bible scholar; Azariah Figo, a famous  preacher; and, above all, Moses Chayyim Luzzatto, the first Jewish  dramatist, the dramas preceding his having interest only as attempts.  He, too, is caught in the meshes of the Kabbala, and falls a victim to  its powers of darkness. His dramas testify to poetic gifts and to  extraordinary mastery of the Hebrew language, the faithful companion of  the Jewish nation in all its journeyings. To complete this sketch of the  Italian Jews of that period, it should be added that while in intellect  and attainments they stand above their brethren in faith of other  countries, in character and purity of morals they are their inferiors.    Thereafter literary interest centres in Poland, where rabbinical  literature found its most zealous and most learned exponents. Throughout  the land schools were established, in which the Talmud was taught by the  _Pilpul_, an ingenious, quibbling method of Talmudic reasoning and  discussion, said to have originated with Jacob Pollak. Again we have a  long succession of distinguished names. There are Solomon Luria, Moses  Isserles, Joel Sirkes, David ben Levi, Sabbatai Kohen, and Elias Wilna.  Sabbatai Kohen, from whom, were pride of ancestry permissible in the  republic of letters, the present writer would boast descent, was not  only a Talmudic writer; he also left historical and poetical works.  Elias Wilna, the last in the list, had a subtle, delicately poised mind,  and deserves special mention for his determined opposition to the  Kabbala and its offspring Chassidism, hostile and ruinous to Judaism and  Jewish learning.    A gleam of true pleasure can be obtained from the history of the Dutch  Jews. In Holland the Jews united secular culture with religious  devotion, and the professors of other faiths met them with tolerance and  friendliness. Sunshine falls upon the Jewish schools, and right into the  heart of a youth, who straightway abandons the Talmud folios, and goes  out into the world to proclaim to wondering mankind the evangel of a  new philosophy. The youth is Baruch Spinoza!    There are many left to expound Judaism: Manasseh ben Israel, writing  both Hebrew and Latin books to plead the cause of the emancipation of  his people and of its literary pre-eminence; David Neto, a student of  philosophy; Benjamin Mussafia, Orobio de Castro, David Abenator Melo, "]]]
