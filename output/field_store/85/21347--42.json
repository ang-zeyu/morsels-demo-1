[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#6)"],[1,"blown out.    \"My sister is dead!\" cried Gabriel and, leaping into the sea, he cleft  the waves with the rapidity of lightning.    The storm had redoubled its intensity; long lines of lightning, rending  the sides of the clouds, bathed everything in their tawny and  intermittent light. The fisherman perceived a ladder leaning against the  front of his home, seized it with a convulsive hand, and in three bounds  flung himself into the room. The prince felt himself strangely moved on  making his way into this pure and silent retreat. The calm and gentle  gaze of the Virgin who seemed to be protecting the rest of the sleeping  girl, that perfume of innocence shed around the maidenly couch, that  lamp, open-eyed amid the shadows, like a soul in prayer, had inspired  the seducer with an unknown distress. Irritated by what he called an  absurd cowardice, he had extinguished the obtrusive light, and was  advancing towards the bed, and addressing unspoken reproaches to  himself, when Gabriel swooped upon him with a wounded tiger's fierce  gnashing of the teeth.    Brancaleone, by a bold and rapid movement that showed no common degree  of skill and bravery, while struggling in the grasp of his powerful  adversary, drew forth in his right hand a long dagger with a fine barbed  blade. Gabriel smiled scornfully, snatched the weapon from him, and even  as he stooped to break it across his knee, gave the prince a furious  blow with his head that made him stagger and sent him rolling on the  floor, three paces away; then, leaning over his poor sister and gazing  on her with hungry eyes, by the passing gleam of a flash, \"Dead!\" he  repeated, wringing his arms in despair,--\"dead!\"    In the fearful paroxysm that compressed his throat he could find no  other words to assuage his rage or to pour forth his woe. His hair,  which the storm had flattened, rose on his head, the marrow of his bones  was chilled, and he felt his tears rush back upon his heart. It was a  terrible moment; he forgot that the murderer still lived.    The prince, however, whose admirable composure did not for a moment  desert him, had risen, bruised and bleeding. Pale and trembling with  rage, he sought everywhere for a weapon with which to avenge himself.  Gabriel returned towards him gloomier and more ominous than ever, and  grasping his neck with an iron hand, dragged him into the room where the  old man was sleeping.    \"Father! father! father!\" he cried in a piercing voice, \"here is the  Bastard who Has just murdered Nisida!\"    The old man, who had drunk but a few drops of the narcotic potion, was  awakened by this cry which echoed through his soul; he arose as though  moved by a spring, flung off his coverings, and with that promptitude of  action that God has bestowed upon mothers in moments of danger, event up  to his daughter's room, found a light, knelt on the edge of the bed, and  began to test his child's pulse and watch her breathing with mortal  anxiety.    All! this had passed in less time than we have taken in telling it.  Brancaleone by an unheard-of effort had freed himself from the hands of  the young fisherman, and suddenly resuming his princely pride, said in a  loud voice, \"You shall not kill me without listening to me.\"    Gabriel would have overwhelmed him with Bitter reproaches, but, unable  to utter a single word, he burst into tears.    \"Your sifter is not dead,\" said the prince, with cold dignity; \"she is  merely asleep. You can assure yourself of it, and meanwhile I undertake,  upon my Honour, not to move a single step away.\"    These words were pronounced with such an accent of truth that the  fisherman was struck by them. An unexpected gleam of hope suddenly  dawned in his thoughts; he cast upon the stranger a glance of hate and  distrust, and muttered in a muffled voice, \"Do not flatter yourself, in  any case, that you will be able to escape me.\"    Then he went up to his sister's room, and approaching the old man, asked  tremblingly, \"Well, father?\"    Solomon thrust him gently aside with the solicitude of a mother removing  some buzzing insect from her child's cradle, and, making a sign to  enjoin silence, added in a low voice, \"She is neither dead nor poisoned.  Some philtre has been given to her for a bad purpose. Her breathing is  even, and she cannot fail to recover from her lethargy.\"    Gabriel, reassured about Nisida's life, returned silently to the ground  floor where he had left the seducer. His manner was grave and gloomy; he  was coming now not to rend the murderer of his sister with his hands,  but to elucidate a treacherous and infamous mystery, and to avenge his  honour which had been basely attacked. He opened wide the double  entrance door that admitted daylight to the apartment in which, on the  few nights that he spent at home, he was accustomed to sleep with his  father. The rain had just stopped, a ray of moonlight pierced the  clouds, and all at once made its way into the room. The fisherman  adjusted his dripping garments, walked towards the stranger, who awaited  him without stirring, and after having gazed upon him haughtily, said,  \"Now you are going to explain your presence in our house.\"    \"I confess,\" said the prince, in an easy tone and with the most insolent  assurance, \"that appearances are against me. It is the fate of lovers to  be treated as thieves. But although I have not the advantage of being  known to you, I am betrothed to the fair Nisida--with your father's  approval, of course. Now, as I have the misfortune to possess very  hardhearted parents, they have had the cruelty to refuse me their  consent. Love led me astray, and I was about to be guilty of a fault for  which a young man like you ought to have some indulgence. Furthermore,  it was nothing but a mere attempt at an abduction, with the best  intentions in the world, I swear, and I am ready to atone for everything  if you will agree to give me your hand and call me your brother.\"    \"I will agree to call you a coward and a betrayer!\" replied Gabriel,  whose face had begun to glow, as he heard his sister spoken of with such  impudent levity. \"If it is thus that insults are avenged in towns, we  fishers have a different plan. Ah! so you flattered yourself with the  thought of bringing desolation aid disgrace into our home, and of paying  infamous assassins to come and share an old man's bread so as to poison  his daughter, of stealing by night, like a brigand, armed with a dagger,  into my sister's room, and of being let off by marrying the most  beautiful woman in the kingdom!\"    The prince made a movement.    \"Listen,\" continued Gabriel: \"I could break you as I broke your dagger  just now; but I have pity on you. I see that you can do nothing with  your hands, neither defend yourself nor work. Go, I begin to understand;  you are a braggart, my fine sir; your poverty is usurped; you have  decked yourself in these poor clothes, but you are unworthy of them.\"    He suffered a glance of crushing contempt to fall upon the prince, then  going to a cupboard hidden in the wall, he drew out a rifle and an axe.    \"Here,\" said he, \"are all the weapons in the house; choose.\"    A flash of joy illuminated the countenance of the prince, who had  hitherto suppressed his rage. He seized the rifle eagerly, drew three  steps backward, and drawing himself up to his full height, said, \"You  would have done better to lend me this weapon at the beginning; for then  I would have been spared from witnessing your silly vapourings and  frantic convulsions. Thanks, young-man; one of my servants will bring  you back your gun. Farewell.\"    And he threw him his purse, which fell heavily at the fisherman's feet.    \"I lent you that rifle to fight with me,\" cried Gabriel, whom surprise  had rooted to the spot.    \"Move aside, my lad; you are out of your senses,\" said the prince,  taking a step towards the door.    \"So you refuse to defend yourself?\" asked Gabriel in a determined voice.    \"I have told you already that I cannot fight with you.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because such is the will of God; because you were born to crawl and I  to trample you under my feet; because all the blood that I could shed in  this island would not purchase one drop of my blood; because a thousand  lives of wretches like you are not equal to one hour of mine; because  you will kneel at my name that I, am now going to utter; because, in  short, you are but a poor fisherman and my name is Prince of  Brancaleone.\"    At this dreaded name, which the young nobleman flung, like a  thunderbolt, at his head, the fisherman bounded like a lion. He drew a  deep breath, as though he had lifted a weight that had long rested on  his heart.    \"Ah!\" he cried, \"you have given yourself into my hands, my lord! Between  the poor fisherman and the all-powerful prince there is a debt of blood.  You shall pay for yourself and for your father. We are going to settle  our accounts, your excellency,\" he added, rising his axe over the head  of the prince, who was aiming at him. \"Oh! you were in too great haste  to choose: the rifle is not loaded.\" The prince turned pale.    \"Between our two families,\" Gabriel continued, \"there exists a horrible  secret which my mother confided to me on the brink of the grave, of  which my father himself is unaware, and that no man in the world must  learn. You are different, you are going to die.\"    He dragged him into the space outside the house.    \"Do you know why my sister, whom you wished to dishonour, was vowed to  the Madonna? Because your father, like you, wished to dishonour my  mother. In your accursed house there is a tradition of infamy. You do  not know what slow and terrible torments my poor mother endured-torments  that broke her strength and caused her to die in early youth, and that  her angelic soul dared confide to none but her son in that supreme hour  and in order to bid me watch over my sister.\"    The fisherman wiped away a burning tear. \"On"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#6)"],[1,"  and tore it up. \"Now,\" he exclaimed, \"you are paid; I owe you nothing  now. If you like, I will declare it on oath in court, and no one will  disbelieve my word.\"    \"Wretched man,\" said the unfortunate widow, \"may God forgive your soul;  but your body will assuredly end on the gallows!\"    It was in vain that she complained, and told of this abominable swindle;  Derues had been beforehand with her, and the slander he had disseminated  bore its fruits. It was said that his old mistress was endeavouring by  an odious falsehood to destroy the reputation of a man who had refused  to be her lover. Although reduced to poverty, she left the house where  she had a right to remain rent free, preferring the hardest and  dreariest life to the torture of remaining under the same roof with the  man who had caused her ruin.    We might relate a hundred other pieces of knavery, but it must not be  supposed that having begun by murder, Derues would draw back and remain  contented with theft. Two fraudulent bankruptcies would have sufficed  for most people; for him they were merely a harmless pastime. Here we  must place two dark and obscure stories, two crimes of which he is  accused, two victims whose death groans no one heard.    The hypocrite's excellent reputation had crossed the Parisian bounds. A  young man from the country, intending to start as a grocer in the  capital, applied to Derues for the necessary information and begged for  advice. He arrived at the latter's house with a sum of eight thousand  livres, which he placed in Derues' hands, asking him for assistance in  finding a business. The sight of gold was enough to rouse the instinct  of crime in Derues, and the witches who hailed Macbeth with the promise  of royalty did not rouse the latter's ambitious desires to a greater  height than the chance of wealth did the greed of the assassin; whose  hands, once closed over the eight thousand livres, were never again  relaxed. He received them as a deposit, and hid them along with his  previous plunder, vowing never to return them. Several days had elapsed,  when one afternoon Derues returned home with an air of such unusual  cheerfulness that the young man questioned him. \"Have you heard some  good news for me?\" he asked, \"or have you had some luck yourself?\"    \"My young friend,\" answered Derues, \"as for me, success depends on my  own efforts, and fortune smiles on me. But I have promised to be useful  to you, your parents have trusted me, and I must prove that their  confidence is well founded. I have heard to-day of a business for  disposal in one of the best parts of Paris. You can have it for twelve  thousand livres, and I wish I could lend you the amount you want. But  you must write to your father, persuade him, reason with him; do not  lose so good a chance. He must make a little sacrifice, and he will be  grateful to me later.\"    In accordance with their son's request, the young man's parents  despatched a sum of four thousand livres, requesting Derues to lose no  time in concluding the purchase.    Three weeks later, the father, very uneasy, arrived in Paris. He came to  inquire about his son, having heard nothing from him. Derues received  him with the utmost astonishment, appearing convinced that the young man  had returned home. One day, he said, the youth informed him that he had  heard from his father, who had given up all idea of establishing him in  Paris, having arranged an advantageous marriage for him near home; and  he had taken his twelve thousand livres, for which Derues produced a  receipt, and started on his return journey.    One evening, when nearly dark, Derues had gone out with his guest, who  complained of headache and internal pains. Where did they go? No one  knew; but Denies only returned at daybreak, alone, weary and exhausted,  and the young man was never again heard of.    One of his apprentices was the constant object of reproof. The boy was  accused of negligence, wasting his time, of spending three hours over a  task which might have been done in less than one. When Derues had  convinced the father, a Parisian bourgeois, that his son was a bad boy  and a good-for-nothing, he came to this man one day in a state of wild  excitement.    \"Your son,\" he said, \"ran away yesterday with six hundred livres, with  which I had to meet a bill to-day. He knew where I kept this money, and  has taken it.\"    He threatened to go before a magistrate and denounce the thief, and was  only appeased by being paid the sum he claimed to have lost. But he had  gone out with the lad the evening before, and returned alone in the  early hours of the morning.    However, the veil which concealed the truth was becoming more and more  transparent every day. Three bankruptcies had diminished the  consideration he enjoyed, and people began to listen to complaints and  accusations which till now had been considered mere inventions designed  to injure him. Another attempt at trickery made him feel it desirable to  leave the neighbourhood.    He had rented a house close to his own, the shop of which had been  tenanted for seven or eight years by a wine merchant. He required from  this man, if he wished to remain where he was, a sum of six hundred  livres as a payment for goodwill. Although the wine merchant considered  it an exorbitant charge, yet on reflection he decided to pay it rather  than go, having established a good business on these premises, as was  well known. Before long a still mare arrant piece of dishonesty gave him  an opportunity for revenge. A young man of good family, who was boarding  with him in order to gain some business experience, having gone into  Derues' shop to make some purchases, amused himself while waiting by  idly writing his name on a piece of blank paper lying on the counter;  which he left there without thinking more about it. Derues, knowing the  young man had means, as soon as he had gone, converted the signed paper  into a promissory note for two thousand livres, to his order, payable at  the majority of the signer. The bill, negotiated in trade, arrived when  due at the wine merchant's, who, much surprised, called his young  boarder and showed him the paper adorned with his signature. The youth  was utterly confounded, having no knowledge of the bill whatever, but  nevertheless could not deny his signature. On examining the paper  carefully, the handwriting was recognised as Derues'. The wine merchant  sent for him, and when he arrived, made him enter a room, and having  locked the door, produced the promissory note. Derues acknowledged  having written it, and tried various falsehoods to excuse himself. No  one listened to him, and the merchant threatened to place the matter in  the hands of the police. Then Derues wept, implored, fell on his knees,  acknowledged his guilt, and begged for mercy. He agreed to restore the  six hundred livres exacted from the wine merchant, on condition that he  should see the note destroyed and that the matter should end there. He  was then about to be married, and dreaded a scandal.    Shortly after, he married Marie-Louise Nicolais; daughter of a  harness-maker at Melun.    One's first impression in considering this marriage is one of profound  sorrow and utmost pity for the young girl whose destiny was linked with  that of this monster. One thinks of the horrible future; of youth and  innocence blighted by the tainting breath of the homicide; of candour  united to hypocrisy; of virtue to wickedness; of legitimate desires  linked to disgraceful passions; of purity mixed with corruption. The  thought of these contrasts is revolting, and one pities such a dreadful  fate. But we must not decide hastily. Madame Denies has not been  convicted of any active part in her husband's later crimes, but her  history, combined with his, shows no trace of suffering, nor of any  revolt against a terrible complicity. In her case the evidence is  doubtful, and public opinion must decide later.    In 1773, Derues relinquished retail business, and left the Saint Victor  neighbourhood, having taken an apartment in the rue des Deux Boules,  near the rue Bertin-Poiree, in the parish of St. Germain l'Auxerrois,  where he had been married. He first acted on commission for the  Benedictine-Camalduian fathers of the forest of Senart, who had heard of  him as a man wholly given to piety; then, giving himself up to usury, he  undertook what is known as \"business affairs,\" a profession which, in  such hands, could not fail to be lucrative, being aided by his exemplary  morals and honest appearance. It was the more easy for him to impose on  others, as he could not be accused of any of the deadly vices which so  often end in ruin--gaming, wine, and women. Until now he had displayed  only one passion, that of avarice, but now another developed itself,  that of ambition. He bought houses and land, and when the money was due,  allowed himself to be sued for it; he bought even lawsuits, which he  muddled with all the skill of a rascally attorney. Experienced in  bankruptcy, he undertook the management of failures, contriving to make  dishonesty appear in the light of unfortunate virtue. When this demon  was not occupied with poison, his hands were busy with every social  iniquity; he could only live and breathe in an atmosphere of corruption.    His wife, who had already presented him with a daughter, gave birth to a  son in February 1774. Derues, in order to better support the airs of  grandeur and the territorial title which he had assumed, invited persons  of distinction to act as sponsors. The child was baptized Tuesday,  February 15th. We give the text of the baptismal register, as a  curiosity:--    \"Antoine-Maximilian-Joseph, son of Antoine-Francois Derues, gentleman,  seigneur of Gendeville, Herchies, Viquemont, and other places, formerly  merchant grocer; and of Madame Marie-Louise Nicolais, his wife.  Godfathers, T. H. and T. P., lords of, etc. etc."]]]
