In the economy of our wild bees we see the manifestation of a wonderful  instinct, as well as the exhibition of a _limited reason_. We can  scarcely deny to animals a kind of reason which apparently differs _only  in degree_ from that of man. Each species works in a sphere limited by  physical laws, but within that sphere it is a free agent. They have  enough of instinct and reason to direct their lives, and to enable them  to act their part in carrying out the plan of creation.

Wyman, in the  Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston, 1866;  and the author's Guide to the Study of Insects, p 123.]    [Footnote 2: Notes on the Habits of the Humble Bee (Proceedings of the  Essex Institute, vol. iv, 1864, p. 101).    Mr. Angus also writes us as follows concerning the habits of the  Wandering Humble bee (Bombus vagans): \"I have found the males plentiful  near our garden fence, within a hole such as would be made by a mouse.  They seem to be quite numerous. I was attracted to it by the noise they  were making in fanning at the opening. I counted at one time as many as  seven thus employed, and the sound could be heard several yards off.  Several males were at rest, but mostly on the wing, when they would make  a dash among the fanners, and all would scatter and play about. The  workers seem to be of a uniform size, and full as large as the males. I  think the object of the fanning was to introduce air into the nest, as  is done by the Honey bees.\"]    [Footnote 3: \"Since writing the above I have opened one of the new holes  of Xylocopa, which was commenced between three and four weeks ago, in a  pine slat used in the staging of the greenhouse. The dimensions were as  follows:--Opening fully 3-8 wide; depth 7-16; whole length of tunnel 6  5-16 inches. The tunnel branched both ways from the hole. One end, from  opening, was 2 5-8, containing three cells, two with larva and pollen,  the third empty. The other side of the opening, or the rest of the  tunnel, was empty, with the exception of the old bee (only one) at work.  I think this was the work of one bee, and, as near as I can judge, about  twenty-five days' work. Width of tunnel inside at widest 9-16 inch.    \"I have just found a Xylocopa bobbing at one of the holes, and in order  to ascertain the depth of the tunnel, and to see whether there were any  others in them, I sounded with a pliable rod, and found others in one  side, at a depth of five and one half inches; the other side was four  inches deep without bees. The morning was cool, so that the object in  bobbing could not have been to introduce fresh currents of air, but must  have had some relation to those inside. Their legs on such occasions  are, as I have noticed, loaded with pollen.\"]          CHAPTER II.    THE HOME OF THE BEES.    [_Concluded._]      While the Andrena and Halictus bees, whose habits we now describe, are  closely allied in form to the Hive bee, socially they are the  \"mud-sills\" of bee society, ranking among the lowest forms of the family  of bees. Their burrowing habits ally them with the ants, from whose  nests their own burrows can scarcely be distinguished. Their economy  does not seem to demand the exercise of so much of a true reasoning  power and pliable instinct as characterizes bees, such as the Honey and  Humble bee, which possess a high architectural skill. Moreover they are  not social; they have no part in rearing and caring for their young, a  fact that lends so much interest to the history of the Hive and Humble  bee. In this respect they are far below the wasps, a family belonging  next below in the system of Nature.    A glance at the drawing (Fig. 28), of a burrow, with its side galleries,  of the Andrena vicina, reveals the economy of one of our most common  forms. Quite early in spring, when the sun and vernal breezes have dried  up the soil, and the fields exchange their rusty hues for the rich green  verdure of May, our Andrena, tired of its idle life among the blossoms  of the willow, the wild cherry, and garden flowers, suddenly becomes  remarkably industrious, and wields its spade-like jaws and busy feet  with a strange and unwonted energy. Choosing some sunny, warm, grassy  bank (these nests were observed in the \"great pasture\" of Salem), not  always with a southern exposure however, the female sinks her deep well  through the sod from six inches to a foot into the sandy soil beneath.  She goes to work literally tooth and nail. Reasoning from observations  made on several species of wasps, and also from studying the structure  of her jaws and legs, it is evident that she digs in and loosens the  soil with her powerful jaws, and then throws out the dirt with her legs.  She uses her fore legs like hands, to pass the load of dirt to her hind  legs, and then runs backward out of her hole to dump it down behind her.  Mr. Emerton tells me that he never saw a bee in the act of digging but  once, and then she left off after a few strokes. He also says, \"they are  harmless and inoffensive. On several occasions I have lain on the grass  near their holes for hours, but not one attempted to sting me; and when  taken between the fingers, they make but feeble resistance.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 28.    Nest (natural size) of Andrena vicina, showing the main burrow, and the  cells leading from it; the oldest cell containing the pupa (_a_) is  situated nearest the surface, while those containing the larva (_b_) lie  between the pupa and the cell (_e_) containing the pollen mass and egg  resting upon it. The most recent cell (_f_) is the deepest down, and  contains a freshly deposited pollen mass. At _c_ is the beginning of a  cell; _g_, level of the ground.]    To enter somewhat into detail, we gather from the observations of Mr.  Emerton (who has carefully watched the habits of these bees through  several seasons) the following account of the economy of this bee: On  the 4th of May the bees were seen digging their holes, most of which  were already two inches deep, and one, six inches. The mounds of earth  were so small as to be hardly noticed. At this time an Oil beetle was  seen prowling about the holes. The presence of this dire foe of Andrena  at this time, it will be seen in a succeeding chapter on the enemies of  the bees, is quite significant. By the 15th of May, hundreds of Andrena  holes were found in various parts of the pasture, and at one place, in a  previous season, there were about two hundred found placed within a  small area. One cell was dug up, but it contained no pollen. Four days  later, several Andrenas were noticed resting from their toil at the  opening of their burrows. On the 28th of May, in unearthing six holes,  eight cells were found to contain pollen, and in two of them a small  larva. The pellets of pollen are about the size of a small pea. They are  hard and round at first, before the young has hatched, but as the larva  grows, the mass becomes softer and more pasty, so that the larva buries  its head in the mass, and greedily sucks it in. When is the pollen  gathered by the bee and kneaded into the pellet-like mass? On July 4th,  a cell was opened in which was a bee busily engaged preparing the  pollen, which was loosely and irregularly piled up, while there was a  larva in an adjoining cell nearly half an inch long. It would seem,  then, that the bee comes in from the fields laden with her stores of  pollen, which she elaborates into bee bread within her cell.    When the bee returns to her cell she does not directly fly towards the  entrance, since, as was noticed in a particular instance, she flew about  for a long time in all directions without any apparent aim, until she  finally settled near the hole, and walked into her subterranean retreat.  On a rainy day, May 24th, our friend visited the colony, but found no  bees flying about the holes. The little hillocks had been beaten down by  the pitiless raindrops, and all traces of their industry effaced. On  digging down, several bees were found, indicating that on rainy days  they seek the shelter of their holes, and do not take refuge under  leaves of the plants they frequent.    On the 29th of June, six full-grown larvae were exhumed, and one, about  half grown. On the 20th of July, the colony seemed well organized, as,  on laying open a burrow at the depth of six inches, he began to find  cells. The upper ones, to the number of a dozen, were deserted and  filled with earth and grass roots, and had evidently been built and used  during the previous year. Below these were eight cells placed around the  main vertical gallery, reaching down to the depth of thirteen inches,  and all containing nearly full-grown larvae of the bees, or else those of  some parasitic bee (Nomada) which had devoured the food prepared for the  young Andrena.    About the first of August the larva transforms to a pupa or chrysalis,  as at this time two pupae were found in cells a foot beneath the surface.  As shown in the cut, those cells situated lowest down seem to be the  last to have been made, while the eggs laid in the highest are the first  to hatch, and the larvae disclosed from them, the first to change to  pupae. Four days later the pupae of Cuckoo bees (Nomada) were found in the  cells. No Andrenas were seen flying about at this time.    On the 24th of August, to be still very circumstantial in our narrative  though at the risk of being tedious, three burrows were unearthed, and  in them three fully formed bees were found nearly ready to leave their  cells, and in addition several pupae. In some other cells there were  three of the parasitic Nomada also nearly ready to come out, which  seemed to be identical with some bees"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],[0,"The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#6)"],[1,"Old Mother Nature had said, it must be true that he was member  of the Squirrel family.  But it was hard to believe.  \"What is this  school?\" he finally asked.    Peter hastened to tell him.  He told Johnny all about what he and  Jumper the Hare had learned about their family, and all the  surprising things Old Mother Nature had told them about the  Squirrel family, and he ended by again urging Johnny Chuck to  join the school and promised to call for Johnny the next morning.    But Johnny Chuck is lazy and does not like to go far from his own  doorstep, so when Peter called the next morning Johnny refused to  go, despite all Peter could say.  Peter didn't waste much time  arguing for he was afraid he would be late and miss something.  When he reached the Green Forest he found his cousin, Jumper the  Hare, and Chatterer the Red Squirrel, and Happy Jack the Gray  Squirrel, already there.  As soon as Peter arrived Old Mother  Nature began the morning lesson.    \"Happy Jack,\" said she, \"you may tell us all you know about your  cousin, Chatterer.\"    \"To begin with, he is the smallest of the Tree Squirrels,\" said  Happy Jack.  \"He isn't so very much bigger than Striped Chipmunk,  and that means that he is less than half as big as myself.  His  coat is red and his waistcoat white; his tail is about two-thirds  as long as his body and flat but not very broad.  Personally, I  don't think it is much of a tail.\"    At once Chatterer's quick temper flared up and he began to scold.  But Old Mother Nature silenced him and told Happy Jack to go on.  \"He spends more of his time in the trees than I do,\" continued  Happy Jack, \"and is especially fond of pine trees and other  cone-bearing trees.  He likes the deeper parts of the Green Forest  better than I do, though he seems to feel just as much at home on  the edge of the Green Forest, especially if it is near a farm where  he can steal corn.\"    Chatterer started to scold again but was silenced once more by Old  Mother Nature.  \"I have to admit that Chatterer is thrifty,\"  continued Happy Jack, quite as if he hadn't been interrupted.  \"He is very fond of the seeds of cone-bearing trees.  He cuts the  cones from the trees just before they are ripe.  Then they ripen  and open on the ground, where he can get at the seeds easily.  He  often has a number of store-houses and stores up cone seeds, acorns,  nuts, and corn when he can get it.  He builds a nest of leaves and  strips of bark, sometimes in a hollow tree and sometimes high up  in the branches of an evergreen tree.  He is a good jumper and  jumps from tree to tree.  He is a busybody and always poking his  nose in where he has no business.  He steals my stores whenever he  can find them.\"    \"You do the same thing to me when you have the chance, which isn't  often,\" sputtered Chatterer.    Happy Jack turned his back to Chatterer and continued, \"He doesn't  seem to mind cold weather at all, as long as the sun shines.  His  noisy tongue is to be heard on the coldest days of winter.  He is  the sauciest, most impudent fellow of the Green Forest, and never  so happy as when he is making trouble for others.  He sauces and  scolds everybody he meets, and every time he opens his mouth he  jerks his tail.  He's quarrelsome.  Worse than that, in the spring  when the birds are nesting, he turns robber.  He goes hunting  for nests and steals the eggs, and what is even more dreadful, he  kills and eats the baby birds.  All the birds hate him, and I  don't blame them.\"    Chatterer could contain himself no longer.  His tongue fairly flew  and he jerked his tail so hard and so fast that Peter Rabbit almost  expected to see him break it right off.  He called Happy Jack  names, all the bad names he could think of, and worked himself up  into such a rage that it was some time before Old Mother Nature  could quiet him.    When at last he stopped from sheer lack of breath, Old Mother  Nature spoke, and her voice was very severe.  \"I'm ashamed of you,  Chatterer,\" said she.  \"Unfortunately, what Happy Jack has said  about you is true.  In  many ways you are a disgrace to the Green  Forest.  Still I don't know how the Green Forest could get along  without you.  Happy Jack forgot to mention that you eat some  insects at times.  He also forgot to mention that sometimes you  have a storehouse down in the ground.  Now tell us what you know  about your cousin, Happy Jack.\"    For a few minutes Chatterer sulked, but he did not dare disobey Old  Mother Nature.  \"I don't know much good about him,\" he mumbled.    \"And you don't know much bad about me either,\" retorted Happy  Jack sharply.    Old Mother Nature held up a warning hand.  \"That will do,\" said  she.  \"Now, Chatterer, go on.\"    \"Happy Jack is more than twice as big as I, but at that, I'm not  afraid of him,\" said Chatterer and glared at Happy Jack.  \"He is  gray all over, except underneath, where he is white.  He has a  tremendously big tail and is so proud of it he shows it off  whenever he has a chance.  When he sits up he has a way of  folding his hands on his breast.  I don't know what he does it  for unless it is to keep them warm in cold weather.  He builds a  nest very much like mine.  Sometimes it is in a hollow tree, but  quite as often it is in the branches of a tree.  He is a good  traveler in the tree-tops, but he spends a good deal of his time  on the ground.  He likes open woodland best, especially where  there are many nut trees.  He has a storehouse where he stores up  nuts for winter, but he buries in the ground and under the leaves  more than he puts in his storehouse.  In winter, when he is hungry,  he hunts for those buried nuts, and somehow he manages to find them  even when they are covered with snow.  When he comes to stealing  he is not better than I am.  I have seen him steal birds' eggs,  and I wouldn't trust him unwatched around one of my storehouses.\"    It was Happy Jacks' turn to become indignant.  \"I may have taken a  few eggs when I accidentally ran across them,\" said he, \"but I never  go looking for them, and I don't take them unless I am very hungry  and can't find anything else.  I don't make a business of robbing  birds the way you do, and you know it.  If I find one of your  storehouses and help myself, I am only getting back what you have  stolen from me.  Everybody loves me and that is more than you  can say.\"    \"That's enough,\" declared Old Mother Nature, and her voice was very  sharp.  \"You two cousins never have agreed and I am afraid never will.  As long as you are neighbors, I suspect you will quarrel.  Have you  told us all you know about Happy Jack, Chatterer?\"    Chatterer nodded.  He was still mumbling to himself angrily and  wasn't polite enough to make a reply.  Old Mother Nature took no  notice of this.  \"What you have told us is good as far as it goes,\"  said she.  \"You said that Happy Jack is all gray excepting  underneath.  Usually the Gray Squirrel is just as Chatterer has  described him, but sometimes a Gray Squirrel isn't gray at all,  but all black.\"    Peter Rabbit's ears stood straight up with astonishment.  \"How can  a Gray Squirrel be black?\" he demanded.    Old Mother Nature smiled.  \"That is a fair question, Peter,\" said  she.  \"Gray Squirrel is simply the name of Happy Jack's family.  Sometimes some of the babies are born with black coats instead of  gray coats.  Of course they are just the same kind of Squirrel,  only they look different.  In some parts of the country there are  numbers of these black-coated Squirrels and many think they are a  different kind of Squirrel.  They are not.  They are simply  black-coated members of Happy Jack's family.  Just remember this.  It is the same way in the family of Rusty the Fox Squirrel.  Some  members are rusty red, some are a mixture of red and gray, and some  are as gray as Happy Jack himself.  Way down in the Sunny South Fox  Squirrels always have white noses and ears.  In the North they never  have white noses and ears.  Rusty the Fox Squirrel is just a little  bigger than Happy Jack and has just such a handsome tail.  He is  the strongest and heaviest of the Tree Squirrels and not nearly  as quick and graceful as Happy Jack.  Sometimes Rusty has two  nests in the same tree, one in a hollow in a tree for bad weather  and the other made of sticks and leaves outside in the branches  for use in good weather.  Rusty's habits are very much the same  as those of Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and therefore he likes  the same kind of surroundings.  Like his cousin, Happy Jack,  Rusty is a great help to me.\"    Seeing how surprised everybody looked, Mother Nature explained.  \"Both Happy Jack and Rusty bury a great many more nuts than they  ever need,\" said she, \"and those they do not dig up sprout in the  spring and grow. In that way they plant ever so many trees without  knowing it.  Just remember that, Chatterer, the next time you are  tempted to quarrel with your cousin, Happy Jack.  Very likely Happy  Jack's great-great-ever-so-great grandfather planted the very tree  you get your fattest and best hickory nuts from.    \"Way out in the mountains of the Far West you have a cousin called  the Douglas Squirrel, who is really a true Red Squirrel and whose  habits are very much like your own.  Some folks call him the Pine  Squirrel.  By the way, Chatterer, Happy Jack forgot to say that  you are a good swimmer.  Perhaps he didn't know it.\"    By the expression of Happy Jack's face it was quite clear that he  didn't know it.  \"Certainly I can swim,\" said Chatterer.  \"I don't  mind the water at all.  I can swim a long distance if I have to.\"    This was quite as much news to Peter Rabbit as had been the fact  that a cousin of his own was a good swimmer, and he began to feel  something very like respect for Chatterer.    \"Are there any other Tree Squirrels?\" asked Jumper the Hare.    \"Yes,\" replied Old Mother Nature, \"there are two--the handsomest  of all the family.  They live out in"]]]
