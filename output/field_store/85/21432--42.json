After a while a handsome blue Bunting  flew along side of her, full of life and joy.    That was my mate and I. How frightened I was! for our nest was in those  green weeds and not very far from the ground. I flew away as soon as I  could pluck up courage, but not far, so that I could watch the lady and  the nest. How my heart jumped when I saw her creep up, part the weeds  and look in. All she saw was a few twigs and a sage-green nest of old  grass laid in a coil. My mate hadn't put in the lining yet; you see it  takes her quite a while to get the thistle down and the hair and strips  of bark for the inside. The next time the lady passed, the house was  done and my mate was sitting on the nest. She just looked down at us  from the back of Mountain Billy and passed on.    Four weeks after, she came again, and there I was, flying about and  singing \"like a bird,\" my mouth full of insects, too. I waited 'till she  had turned away before I flew to the nest to feed our little ones. I  didn't know, you see, that she was such a good friend of ours, or I  wouldn't have been so afraid.

To recount them all would be a formidable task, for their  whole lives were darkened by injustice. There was not a wrong which had  driven the Boer from Cape Colony which he did not now practise himself  upon others--and a wrong may be excusable in 1885 which is monstrous  in 1895. The primitive virtue which had characterised the farmers broke  down in the face of temptation. The country Boers were little affected,  some of them not at all, but the Pretoria Government became a most  corrupt oligarchy, venal and incompetent to the last degree. Officials  and imported Hollanders handled the stream of gold which came in from  the mines, while the unfortunate Uitlander who paid nine-tenths of the  taxation was fleeced at every turn, and met with laughter and taunts  when he endeavoured to win the franchise by which he might peaceably  set right the wrongs from which he suffered. He was not an unreasonable  person. On the contrary, he was patient to the verge of meekness,  as capital is likely to be when it is surrounded by rifles. But his  situation was intolerable, and after successive attempts at peaceful  agitation, and numerous humble petitions to the Volksraad, he began at  last to realise that he would never obtain redress unless he could find  some way of winning it for himself.    Without attempting to enumerate all the wrongs which embittered the  Uitlanders, the more serious of them may be summed up in this way.    1. That they were heavily taxed and provided about seven-eighths of the  revenue of the country. The revenue of the South African Republic--which  had been 154,000 pounds in 1886, when the gold fields were opened--had  grown in 1899 to four million pounds, and the country through the  industry of the newcomers had changed from one of the poorest to the  richest in the whole world (per head of population).    2. That in spite of this prosperity which they had brought, they, the  majority of the inhabitants of the country, were left without a vote,  and could by no means influence the disposal of the great sums which  they were providing. Such a case of taxation without representation has  never been known.    3. That they had no voice in the choice or payment of officials. Men of  the worst private character might be placed with complete authority over  valuable interests. Upon one occasion the Minister of Mines attempted  himself to jump a mine, having officially learned some flaw in its  title. The total official salaries had risen in 1899 to a sum sufficient  to pay 40 pounds per head to the entire male Boer population.    4. That they had no control over education. Mr. John Robinson, the  Director General of the Johannesburg Educational Council, has reckoned  the sum spent on Uitlander schools as 650 pounds out of 63,000 pounds  allotted for education, making one shilling and tenpence per head per  annum on Uitlander children, and eight pounds six shillings per head  on Boer children--the Uitlander, as always, paying seven-eighths of the  original sum.    5. No power of municipal government. Watercarts instead of pipes,  filthy buckets instead of drains, a corrupt and violent police, a high  death-rate in what should be a health resort--all this in a city which  they had built themselves.    6. Despotic government in the matter of the press and of the right of  public meeting.    7. Disability from service upon a jury.    8. Continual harassing of the mining interest by vexatious legislation.  Under this head came many grievances, some special to the mines and some  affecting all Uitlanders. The dynamite monopoly, by which the miners had  to pay 600,000 pounds extra per annum in order to get a worse quality  of dynamite; the liquor laws, by which one-third of the Kaffirs were  allowed to be habitually drunk; the incompetence and extortions of the  State-owned railway; the granting of concessions for numerous articles  of ordinary consumption to individuals, by which high prices were  maintained; the surrounding of Johannesburg by tolls from which the town  had no profit--these were among the economical grievances, some large,  some petty, which ramified through every transaction of life.    And outside and beyond all these definite wrongs imagine to a free born  progressive man, an American or a Briton, the constant irritation of  being absolutely ruled by a body of twenty-five men, twenty-one of  whom had in the case of the Selati Railway Company been publicly and  circumstantially accused of bribery, with full details of the bribes  received, while to their corruption they added such crass ignorance that  they argue in the published reports of the Volksraad debates that using  dynamite bombs to bring down rain was firing at God, that it is impious  to destroy locusts, that the word 'participate' should not be used  because it is not in the Bible, and that postal pillar boxes are  extravagant and effeminate. Such obiter dicta may be amusing at a  distance, but they are less entertaining when they come from an autocrat  who has complete power over the conditions of your life.    From the fact that they were a community extremely preoccupied by  their own business, it followed that the Uitlanders were not ardent  politicians, and that they desired to have a share in the government of  the State for the purpose of making the conditions of their own industry  and of their own daily lives more endurable. How far there was need of  such an interference may be judged by any fair-minded man who reads the  list of their complaints. A superficial view may recognise the Boers as  the champions of liberty, but a deeper insight must see that they (as  represented by their elected rulers) have in truth stood for all  that history has shown to be odious in the form of exclusiveness and  oppression. Their conception of liberty has been a selfish one, and they  have consistently inflicted upon others far heavier wrongs than those  against which they had themselves rebelled.    As the mines increased in importance and the miners in numbers, it  was found that these political disabilities affected some of that  cosmopolitan crowd far more than others, in proportion to the amount of  freedom to which their home institutions had made them accustomed. The  continental Uitlanders were more patient of that which was unendurable  to the American and the Briton. The Americans, however, were in so great  a minority that it was upon the British that the brunt of the struggle  for freedom fell. Apart from the fact that the British were more  numerous than all the other Uitlanders combined, there were special  reasons why they should feel their humiliating position more than the  members of any other race. In the first place, many of the British were  British South Africans, who knew that in the neighbouring countries  which gave them birth the most liberal possible institutions had been  given to the kinsmen of these very Boers who were refusing them the  management of their own drains and water supply. And again, every Briton  knew that Great Britain claimed to be the paramount power in South  Africa, and so he felt as if his own land, to which he might have looked  for protection, was conniving at and acquiescing in his ill treatment.  As citizens of the paramount power, it was peculiarly galling that they  should be held in political subjection. The British, therefore, were the  most persistent and energetic of the agitators.    But it is a poor cause which cannot bear to fairly state and honestly  consider the case of its opponents. The Boers had made, as has been  briefly shown, great efforts to establish a country of their own. They  had travelled far, worked hard, and fought bravely. After all their  efforts they were fated to see an influx of strangers into their  country, some of them men of questionable character, who outnumbered  the original inhabitants. If the franchise were granted to these,  there could be no doubt that though at first the Boers might control  a majority of the votes, it was only a question of time before the  newcomers would dominate the Raad and elect their own President, who  might adopt a policy abhorrent to the original owners of the land. Were  the Boers to lose by the ballot-box the victory which they had won by  their rifles? Was it fair to expect it? These newcomers came for gold.  They got their gold. Their companies paid a hundred per cent. Was not  that enough to satisfy them? If they did not like the country why did  they not leave it? No one compelled them to stay there. But if they  stayed, let them be thankful that they were tolerated at all, and not  presume to interfere with the laws of those by whose courtesy they were  allowed to enter the country.    That is a fair statement of the Boer position, and at first sight an  impartial man might say that there was a good deal to say for it; but  a closer examination would show that, though it might be tenable in  theory, it is unjust and impossible in practice.    In the present crowded state of the world a policy of Thibet may be  carried out in some obscure corner, but it cannot be done in a great  tract of country which lies right across the main line of industrial  progress. The position is too absolutely artificial. A handful of people  by the right of conquest take possession of an enormous country over  which they are dotted at such intervals that it is their boast that one  farmhouse cannot see the smoke of another, and yet, though their numbers  are so disproportionate to the area which they cover, they refuse to  admit any other people upon equal terms, but claim to be a privileged  class who shall dominate the newcomers completely. They are outnumbered  in their own land by immigrants who are far more highly educated and  progressive, and yet they hold them down in a way which exists nowhere  else upon earth. What is their right?"]]]
