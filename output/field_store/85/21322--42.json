A few men are more perfect  than others, but all are liable to mistakes. Errors are found in all the  histories of humanity; shall we therefore discard science and civil  government? or shall we turn misanthropists? No; we will do neither. We  are in a progressive age. We were capacitated for progression. We would  not be men without this capacity. Let us ever remember that man is,  after all his mistakes, the noblest creature of God, having God-like  attributes. Do you doubt this? Then tell us why it is that a falsehood  is always detestible to the mind. Why do men strenuously avoid  contradictory propositions? The God-like in man is the great secret of  his progression. He is a progressive being. Shall we on this account  condemn all that in which man has and does progress? Shall we condemn  Christianity on account of man's failures? Shall we discourage his  honest efforts by keeping those failures always before him? Have men  made no mistakes in science? Shall we repudiate on account of mistakes?  Then there will be no end to repudiations. Let us remember and talk of  the many mistakes that have been made in both science and religion, like  the man \"who visits the shadows in the deep ravines, in order that he  may more fully realize the fact that the sun shines;\" that is to say,  let us talk of old, effete dogmas in science and in religion only to  more fully realize the fact that the sunlight of truth is shining. Yes!  Man has progressed. \"Science and religion both stand true to their God.\"  Man alone deviates. How often do we hear men say, \"Science is  progressive?\" Scientific truth is always the same. Man is not always the  same. Shall we keep his many deviations from truth and principle before  him in order to cause greater deviations? Who will \"deliver\" the  unbelievers of our country \"from this dead body?\" It contains all the  errors of the ages. Their name is \"legion.\" Among them we behold laws in  the early history of our own country that to-day would shock the common  sense of our country. Examine the old \"Blue Laws of Connecticut.\" Among  the errors of the past we find the \"rack,\" the \"thumb-screw,\" the  \"inquisition\"--I was going to add the cross, but I recollect that  unbelievers do not put that in their list. They do not sympathize with  Christ, so they leave the cross out; in fact they do not like to talk  about it. \"It is their stumbling stone; the rock of their offense.\" I am  tempted to say more about the errors of scientists in the bygone, but I  must forbear; for in so doing I would ape the unbelievers. I have no  great love for apes. So far as old, effete, erroneous opinions and  faiths are concerned, with the old instruments of torture belonging to  the shadows of the dark ages, we should say, disturb not the dead.    A man making his appearance among us as a lecturer, condemning all the  sciences, presenting to the public mind the hundred and one old false  ideas known in the history of scientific investigation, would be hissed  out of literary circles.    An orator coming before the American people as a speaker, loaded with  all the imperfections of our government, with its errors in legislation,  its wicked and corrupt men accepting bribes, its mistakes on the fields  of battle, resulting in great loss of life, as an open enemy to our  country, breathing out treason, would subject himself to the anathemas  of our government. The course pursued by unbelievers against the  religion of Jesus Christ is without a parallel in the fields of science,  civil governments and morals, yet the way is equally open in all those  directions for a similar effort.    What is the value of the religion of Christ? What is the estimate placed  upon it by the best minds of America? Andrew Jackson said, in his last  hours, \"That book, sir,\" pointing to the Bible, \"is the rock on which  our republic rests.\"    Benjamin Franklin said, \"As to Jesus of Nazareth, my opinion of whom you  particularly desire, I think the system of morals, and his religion, as  he left them to us, is the best the world ever saw, or is likely to  see.\"    John Adams said, \"The Bible is the best book in the world.\"    Henry Clay said, \"I always have had, and always shall have, a profound  regard for Christianity, the religion of my fathers, and for its rites,  its usages and observances.\"    U. S. Grant said, \"Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet anchor of our  liberties; write its precepts on your hearts, and practice them in your  lives. To the influence of this book we are indebted for the progress  made in true civilization, and to this we must look as our guide in the  future.\"    General George Washington said, \"It is impossible to govern the world  without God. He must be worse than an infidel that lacks faith, and more  than wicked that has not gratitude enough to acknowledge his  obligation.\"          THE DOMAIN OR PROVINCE OF SCIENCE.      The Greeks used the word \"epistasin\" to express the idea that we express  by the word science. Our word means certain knowledge. Theirs was  understood to mean \"coming to a stand,\" from \"epi,\" upon, and \"staseo,\"  to stand. Science takes account of phenomenon and seeks its law. When  you apprehend a phenomenon and discover its law you have accomplished  all that the term indicates, even though you fail to comprehend the whys  and wherefores of the law. \"Certain knowledge,\" this phrase indicates  limitation. All that it demands is that you know that which you profess  to know. It therefore follows that the word \"science\" is equally  applicable to the comprehensible and incomprehensible. The word is from  \"scio,\" _I know_. As men's knowledge, in the present state, at least, is  limited, so science, as presented by man, is also limited; but, as men  are progressive beings, science and the sciences may increase, adding  more and more of truth. There are, however, shores beyond which science  will never carry us, but on the contrary will leave us to settle down,  to rest forever in content or discontent, just as we choose.    The modern hypothesis of materialistic unbelievers is that there is but  one substance in the universe, and that is matter. If this be so, then  all knowledge pertains to matter, and when you have reasoned yourself to  the last element known, or knowable, in physical analysis, which will be  the point of departure as well as your ultimate truth behind which you  can not go, then, of course, you are where you must rest satisfied or  dissatisfied; you have come to the Rubicon beyond which you will never  pass. The mere physicist finds, as a legitimate result of his hypothesis  of but one substance, his rest in the ultimate of eternal matter and  blind force. The Christian, recognizing spiritual substance also, finds  his ultimate or resting place in God, who is the last element in vital  and mental analysis, and also the Christian's starting point in his  inductive reasonings. We realize that scientific knowledge is  profitable, even in the field of matter, but if we refuse to science any  domain above matter she will lead us to the dust of the grave, there to  forsake us forever amid its gloom and sorrow. Here Colonel Ingersoll's  \"night birds\"--for angels he has no use--move with \"rustling of wings.\"  When such men reason themselves back to the germ cells and sperm cells,  and stand there upon the last element in the analysis of the human body,  they are not able to take another step until they acknowledge the  existence of spiritual substance as matters master, which ever was, and  is above matter, which takes hold of matter and builds germ cells and  sperm cells and inhabits them, as the inherent fore which superintends  the building, differentiating the species, and determining the sex.    Ask the unbeliever, the materialist, what this vital principle is, and  he answers: \"It is the all-pervading force that is modified by the  organic structure.\" That is, in his philosophy, the \"vital force is  produced by the organism,\" and the \"organism is produced by the vital  principle?\" So, being at the last limit of the physical analysis of the  organic being, he is involved in a contradiction, while the Christian  who believes in a spiritual substance refers all to spirit, and claims a  continuation of his identity as an intelligent spirit, resting in his  ultimate or starting point, viz: God. Do you say I am lost in God? Well,  to be thus lost in God is to be saved from corruption and from the dust  of the grave; but to be lost in the dust of the grave and in the  ceaseless changes of matter is to be lost to God and to spiritual being.  Let me be with God rather than lost amid the dark waves of oblivion.    Has science no prerogatives above the physical? Tread lightly here; you  might step on holy ground. Do you use the old cry that all outside of  matter belongs to the \"unknown\" and \"unknowable?\" Exchange the terms for  the terms the \"uncomprehended\" and the \"incomprehensible,\" and we will  walk side by side. We know many things which we do not comprehend. Do we  comprehend all that belongs to the physical sciences? Do we comprehend  matter? I know that I know, but do I comprehend that knowledge? If I  should say I know the unknowable, I am guilty of a contradiction in  language. Do you say matter is infinite? Can I comprehended the  infinite? If science be that certain knowledge which is the equivalent  of comprehension, then one of two things is true: First, there is no  such thing as physical science; or, secondly, I may have certain  knowledge of the infinite--may comprehend the infinite. How is this?  Where is the difficulty? It is here: the knowledge which constitutes  science is not necessarily that knowledge which is the equivalent of  the comprehension of the thing known. Hence the incomprehensible is not  to be excluded from the field of scientific investigation. If matter be  infinite, and if it belongs to the field of scientific knowledge, then  the infinite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26323"],[0,"The Suffrage Cook Book (#6)"],[1,"spoon), add  that to the crumbs.

I have sent but one recipe to a cook book, and            that was a direction for driving a nail, as it has            always been declared that women do not know how to            drive nails. But that was when nails were a            peculiar shape and had to be driven in particular            way, but now that nails are made round there is no            special way in which they need to be driven. So my            favorite recipe cannot be given you.
