There  are no records of these observations now extant, and they are noteworthy  only as a preparation for more serious work.    He was carrying out his resolve to see everything for himself. His  assiduity may be judged of by the fact that between 1774 and 1781  HERSCHEL had observed a single object--the Nebula of _Orion_--no less  than fourteen times.    The success of his first telescopes incited him to new efforts. His  house became a complete _atelier_, where everything that could tend to  excellence in this manufacture was tried and re-tried a hundred  different ways. When a difficulty arose, experiments were begun which  continued till it was conquered. When a success was gained, it was  prosecuted to the utmost.    In 1775 the first seven-foot reflector was made, in 1777 a ten-foot was  finished, in 1778 a \"very good\" ten-foot took its place. It must not be  thought that the telescopes mentioned were the only ones completed. On  the contrary, they were but the best ones selected out of many.    In 1774 a new house had been engaged, which had \"more room for  workshops,\" and whose roof gave space for observing. The grass-plat near  it was soon utilized to hold the stand of a twenty-foot telescope, which  he had even then projected. His projects were unending, no success was  final; his mind was at the height of activity; his whole effort was  thrown into every undertaking.    The mirrors for all these telescopes were made by hand. Every portion  of the grinding down to rough dimensions, the shaping to something near  the correct form, the polishing till the accurately exact curves were  obtained, all this must be done by hand. The machines for the purpose  were not invented until 1788.[11]    ALEXANDER and WILLIAM worked together at this, but most of the work was  done by the latter. The sister's part was to attend in the workshop and  lend a hand wherever and whenever it was needed.        . . . \"My time was taken up with copying music and practising, besides      attendance on my brother when polishing, since by way of keeping him      alive I was constantly obliged to feed him by putting the victuals by      bits into his mouth. This was once the case when, in order to finish      a seven-foot mirror, he had not taken his hands from it for sixteen      hours together. In general he was never unemployed at meals, but was      always at those times contriving or making drawings of whatever      came in his mind. Generally I was obliged to read to him whilst      he was at the turning-lathe, or polishing mirrors, _Don Quixote_,      _Arabian Nights' Entertainment_, the novels of STERNE, FIELDING,      etc.; serving tea and supper without interrupting the work with      which he was engaged, . . . and sometimes lending a hand. I became,      in time, as useful a member of the workshop as a boy might be to      his master in the first year of his apprenticeship. . . . But as      I was to take a part the next year in the oratorios, I had, for a      whole twelvemonth, two lessons per week from Miss FLEMING, the      celebrated dancing-mistress, to drill me for a gentlewoman (God      knows how she succeeded). So we lived on without interruption.      My brother ALEX. was absent from Bath for some months every summer,      but when at home he took much pleasure in executing some turning or      clockmaker's work for his brother.\"    News from Hanover put a sudden stop, for a time, to all these labors.  The mother wrote, in the utmost distress, to say that DIETRICH had  disappeared from his home, it was supposed with the intention of going  to India \"with a young idler not older than himself.\" His brother  immediately left the lathe at which he was turning an eye-piece in  cocoa-nut, and started for Holland, whence he proceeded to Hanover,  failing to meet his brother, as he expected. Meanwhile the sister  received a letter to say that DIETRICH was \"laid up very ill\" at an inn  in Wapping. ALEXANDER posted to town, removed him to a lodging, and,  after a fortnight's nursing, brought him to Bath, where, on his brother  WILLIAM'S return, he found him being well cared for by his sister.    About this time another change was made to the house 19 New King Street,  which was the last move in Bath. It was here that the _Georgium Sidus_  was discovered.    The music still went on. The oratorios of the _Messiah_, _Judas  Maccabeus_, and _Samson_ were to be performed under HERSCHEL'S  direction, with an orchestra of nearly one hundred pieces. The scores  and vocal parts of these CAROLINA copied with her own hands, and the  _soprani_ were instructed by her, she being the leading soloist. Along  with the music went the astronomy. Not only were new telescopes made,  but they were made for immediate use.    The variable star _Mira Ceti_ was observed, and a long series of lunar  observations begun.        \"In 1779, 1780, and 1781 I measured the heights of about one hundred      mountains of the moon, by three different methods.        \"Some of these observations are given in _Philosophical      Transactions_, vol. LXX., but most remain uncalculated in my journal      _till some proper opportunity.\"[12]_    While HERSCHEL was measuring these lunar mountains, in December, 1779,  he made by chance an acquaintance of much value to him. Dr. WILLIAM  WATSON, a Fellow of the Royal Society, distinguished for his researches  in electricity, happened to see him at his telescope, and this led to a  visit and an invitation to HERSCHEL to join the Philosophical Society of  Bath, then forming. This he gladly did, and it was of use to him in many  ways.    He there formed acquaintance with men of his own way of thinking, and he  himself became known. Better than all, he learned to measure himself  with other men, and by his early papers read to the Society, he gained  skill in putting his thoughts before his hearers. This skill he never  lost, and the merely literary art of his memoirs would make his papers  remarkable without their other merits. He is always clear, and in his  early papers especially, he appeals to his particular audience--the  Royal Society--in a way which shows that he is conscious of all its  weaknesses as well as of its dignity. Later, his tone slightly changed.  He became less anxious to win his audience, for he had become an  authority. This knowledge lent a quiet strength to his style, but never  induced the slightest arrogance of spirit or manner.    The Bath Philosophical Society has left no printed proceedings. HERSCHEL  was one of its earliest members, and many papers were communicated to it  by his hand. These appear to have been of a very miscellaneous nature.  Some of them at least would be of the highest interest to us now.    In the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1789, p. 220, HERSCHEL tells us  that he communicated to that Society \"certain mathematical papers\"  relating to central forces other than the force of gravity, which are or  may be concerned in the construction of the sidereal heavens. This early  idea was still entertained by HERSCHEL in 1789, and the mathematical  papers referred to must be contained in the _Minutes_ of the Society,  which on its dissolution were torn from the Minute-book and returned to  the writers.    The earliest published writing of HERSCHEL is the answer to the prize  question in the \"Ladies' Diary\" for 1779, proposed by the celebrated  LANDEN, namely:        \"The length, tension, and weight of a musical string being given,      it is required to find how many vibrations it will make in a given      time, when a small given weight is fastened to its middle and      vibrates with it.\"    In the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society for 1780, are  two papers of his. The title of the first is, _Astronomical Observations  on the Periodical Star in Collo Ceti_, by Mr. WILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath.  This was communicated to the Society by Dr. WILLIAM WATSON, Jr., and  was read May 11, 1780, at the same time as the other paper on the  mountains of the moon. It is to be noted that HERSCHEL was at this time  plain \"Mr. WILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath.\" It was only in 1786 that he  became \"Dr. HERSCHEL,\" through the Oxford degree of LL.D.    Neither of these two papers is specially remarkable on its purely  astronomical side. The problems examined were such as lay open before  all, and the treatment of them was such as would naturally be suggested.    The second of these two contained, however, a short description of his  Newtonian telescope, and he speaks of it with a just pride: \"I believe  that for distinctness of vision this instrument is perhaps equal to any  that was ever made.\" He was, at least, certain of having obtained  excellence in the making of his instruments.    In his next paper, however, read January 11, 1781, a subject is  approached which shows a different kind of thought. It is the first  obvious proof of the truth of the statement which he made long  afterwards (1811), when he said: \"A knowledge of the construction of  the heavens has always been the ultimate object of my observations.\"    The title of this paper was _Astronomical Observations on the Rotation  of the Planets round their Axes, made with a view to determine whether  the Earth's diurnal motion is perfectly equable_. Here the question is a  difficult and a remote one, and the method adopted for its solution is  perfectly suitable in principle. It marks a step onward from mere  observations to philosophizing upon their results. In practical  astronomy, too, we note an advance. Not only are his results given, but  also careful estimates of the errors to be feared in them, and a  discussion of the sources of such errors. The same volume of the  _Philosophical Transactions_ which contains this paper, also contains  another, _Account of a Comet_, read April 26, 1781. This comet was the  major planet "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29056"],[0,"Almost A Man (#6)"],[1," is thus created, which  grows with its growth, and strengthens with its increasing weakness and  decay.\"    A tendency to commit suicide seems to be a marked bequest of an  inebriate parent to his children, and it is well to state that in the  opinion of medical men who are dealing with all forms of inebriety, the  evils resulting to the children may be transmitted by parents who have  never been noted for drunkenness. Continual moderate drinking keeps the  body so constantly under the influence of alcohol that a crowd of  nervous difficulties and disorders may be transmitted even more surely  than from the parent who has occasional sprees with long intervals of  sobriety between. It is not only through the drinking father that injury  is done to the children, but the mother may have a vitiated inheritance  from her father and transmit it to her children.    When we recall the fact that one hundred thousand men fall into  drunkard's graves every year, we are appalled at the thought of that  vast army marching on to death and destruction. As we listen, we can, in  fancy, almost hear the tramp, tramp of that \"mighty host advancing,  Satan leading on.\" In the front rank comes the one hundred thousand men  who shall fall into drunkard's graves this year, and behind them the one  hundred thousand men who are to fall next year. They come with sound of  revelry and song, and close beside them press a crowd of weeping wives  and mothers and little children, starved, crippled, and murdered, who  are to be fellow victims with the drunkard. Not very far back from the  front row come one hundred thousand young men in the very prime of  young, vigorous life, just beginning to drink their first glass of wine  or beer, with no intention of ever standing in that front row, yet  having started on the way. Back of them, one hundred little school boys  who think it manly to ape the follies of their predecessors. Back of  them, one hundred thousand little toddlers whose feet stagger in their  innocent helplessness. Back of them, one hundred thousand mothers with  babies in their arms. Oh, how sweetly those baby eyes look up into the  loving eyes that are brooding over them. Is it possible those baby brows  will ever lie low in the gutter, those sweet lips be stained by oath or  glass; those crumpled rose-leaf fingers ever strike the murderous blow  incited by alcohol? It must be, if that front rank of one hundred  thousand drunkards is to be recruited, for the drunkards of the future  are to-day babies in their mother's arms. Do you who read these words  intend to join this vast army of prospective drunkards, or will you  belong to the cold-water army that is marching on accompanied by health,  vigor, industry, prosperity, success and long life?    We must not be so interested in the inheritance of evil qualities as to  forget the transmission of good. We read in Exodus, twentieth chapter,  that the sins of the fathers are to be visited upon the children unto  the third and fourth generations of them that hate the Lord, but mercy  will be shown to _thousands of generations_ of them that love Him and  keep his commandments. As we have seen the sins of the fathers are  visited upon the children in transmission of diseased bodies, perverted  moral natures and weakened wills, and realize that the promise is being  fulfilled in the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the  children, let us see if the other promise is being fulfilled also, in  the mercy shown to thousands of them that love the Lord and keep His  commandments.    An English specialist in children's diseases has carefully noted the  difference between twelve families of drinkers and twelve families of  sober parents during a period of twelve years.                            INTEMPERATE. | TEMPERATE.                                       |    Produced 57 children; 25 died in   | Produced 61 children; 6 died    the first week of life.

This leaves only 10 who showed     |    during the whole of life a         |    normal disposition and development |    of body and mind.                  |    If it were not a fact that health, purity, integrity, intellect and  virtue were being transmitted to a far greater extent than sin and vice,  there would be little good in the world, but the transmission of these  good qualities is so extended, so like the air and the sunshine and the  water, a common thing, that we almost forget to recognize it. When we  turn our thoughts to the investigation of this phase of the subject, we  find that vigorous parents have healthful children, that powers of  intellect are transmitted, and that honesty and uprightness in the  father warrants us in expecting the same in the son. We recognize the  transmission of powers of intellect in the fact that where the parents  have a peculiar talent, we very generally find the same talent in their  children. We are acquainted with musical families, mathematical  families, artistic families, and in the study of renowned people of the  world we find evidences of this transmission of intellect. We also learn  that the effects of education are transmissible, and if the parents are  educated along a certain line the children receive education along that  line much more readily. This fact becomes a wonderful incentive to us to  build up all that is best in our own natures in order that through us  the world may receive an impetus towards higher and better things.    Sometimes when your faults and defects press upon you with tremendous  force and you find it so very hard to overcome them, you may be tempted  to lay the blame on your ancestry who gave you such a dower, who by  their lives handicapped you in your life-struggle. You may feel inclined  to say with some writer, to me unknown, who says:      HEREDITY.        \"Your strictures are unmerited,        Our follies are inherited,      Directly from our gran-pas they all came;        Our defects have been transmitted,      And we should be acquitted        Of all responsibility and blame.        We are not depraved beginners,        But hereditary sinners,      For our fathers never acted as they should;        'Tis the folly of our gran-pas      That continually hampers--        What a pity that our gran-pas weren't good!        Yes, we'd all be reverend senators,        If our depraved progenitors      Had all been prudent, studious and wise;        But they were quite terrestial,      Or we would be celestial,        Yes, we'd all be proper tenants for the skies.        If we're not all blameless sages,        And beacons to the ages,      And fit for principalities and powers;        If we do not guide and man it,      And engineer the planet,        'Tis the folly of our forefathers--not ours.\"    But the lesson of these lines is not that you should lie back in  inaction, making no effort to overcome your defects because they are  inheritances. There is for you a wiser lesson in the theme than that.  When Marshall Ney was taunted with the fact that the Imperial nobility  had no pedigree he proudly replied, \"We are ancestors.\"    There is a grand thought for you. If your ancestors did not do the best  for you, will you not profit by your knowledge of this fact and do the  best for those who shall look back to you as their ancestor? Supposing  that your parents in their youth had said: \"I will take care of my  health so that my children may be born with vigorous bodies; I will make  good use of my intellect so that my children will inherit an added  capacity for acquiring knowledge; I will obey all laws of morality so  that my children will by inheritance tend toward virtue;\" and supposing  that you to-day, with healthful bodies, keen intellects and upward  tending moral natures, were reaping the reward of their forethought,  would you not bless them for it?    You have no right to remain listless and discouraged because of your  inheritances, whatever they may be. Hear the inspiriting words of Ella  Wheeler Wilcox:        There is no thing you cannot overcome.      Say not thy evil instinct is inherited;      Or that some trait inborn, makes thy whole life forlorn,      And calls for punishment that is not merited.        Back of thy parents and grandparents lies,      The great Eternal Will; that, too, is thine      Inheritance--strong, beautiful, divine;      Sure lever of success for one who tries.        Pry up thy fault with this great lever--will;      However deeply bedded in propensity;      However firmly set, I tell thee firmer yet      Is that great power that comes from truth's immensity.        There is no noble height thou canst not climb;      All triumphs may be thine in time's futurity,      If whatsoe'er thy fault, thou dost not faint or halt,      But lean upon the staff of God's security.        Earth has no claim the soul can not contest.      Know thyself part of the supernal source,      And naught can stand before thy spirit's force      The soul's divine inheritance is best.    The youth of to-day have in their own hands the molding of the future,  not only of themselves, but of the nation, by the every day habits of  their lives. By their thoughts and aspirations, by the moral tendencies  which they are cultivating in themselves, they are determining what  shall be the characteristics of the nation in a hundred years to come.  Shall this be, in a hundred years, a nation of drunkards? The young  people of to-day are deciding that question. Shall it be a nation of  invalids? This, also, the young people are deciding. Shall it be a  nation filled with greed of"]]]
