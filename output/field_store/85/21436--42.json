PART I.         Of the Formation and Decomposition of Aeriform Fluids--of the       Combustion of Simple Bodies--and the Formation of Acids.          CHAP. I.    _Of the Combinations of Caloric, and the Formation of Elastic Aeriform  Fluids._      That every body, whether solid or fluid, is augmented in all its  dimensions by any increase of its sensible heat, was long ago fully  established as a physical axiom, or universal proposition, by the  celebrated Boerhaave. Such facts as have been adduced for controverting  the generality of this principle offer only fallacious results, or, at  least, such as are so complicated with foreign circumstances as to  mislead the judgment: But, when we separately consider the effects, so  as to deduce each from the cause to which they separately belong, it is  easy to perceive that the separation of particles by heat is a constant  and general law of nature.    When we have heated a solid body to a certain degree, and have thereby  caused its particles to separate from each other, if we allow the body  to cool, its particles again approach each other in the same proportion  in which they were separated by the increased temperature; the body  returns through the same degrees of expansion which it before extended  through; and, if it be brought back to the same temperature from which  we set out at the commencement of the experiment, it recovers exactly  the same dimensions which it formerly occupied. But, as we are still  very far from being able to arrive at the degree of absolute cold, or  deprivation of all heat, being unacquainted with any degree of coldness  which we cannot suppose capable of still farther augmentation, it  follows, that we are still incapable of causing the ultimate particles  of bodies to approach each other as near as is possible; and,  consequently, that the particles of all bodies do not touch each other  in any state hitherto known, which, tho' a very singular conclusion, is  yet impossible to be denied.    It is supposed, that, since the particles of bodies are thus continually  impelled by heat to separate from each other, they would have no  connection between themselves; and, of consequence, that there could be  no solidity in nature, unless they were held together by some other  power which tends to unite them, and, so to speak, to chain them  together; which power, whatever be its cause, or manner of operation, we  name Attraction.    Thus the particles of all bodies may be considered as subjected to the  action of two opposite powers, the one repulsive, the other attractive,  between which they remain in equilibrio. So long as the attractive force  remains stronger, the body must continue in a state of solidity; but if,  on the contrary, heat has so far removed these particles from each  other, as to place them beyond the sphere of attraction, they lose the  adhesion they before had with each other, and the body ceases to be  solid.    Water gives us a regular and constant example of these facts; whilst  below Zero[2] of the French thermometer, or 32 deg. of Fahrenheit, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#6)"],[1,"breakfast.\"  (George is so practical.)  \"Now for breakfast we  shall want a frying-pan\"--(Harris said it was indigestible; but we merely  urged him not to be an ass, and George went on)--\"a tea-pot and a kettle,  and a methylated spirit stove.\"    \"No oil,\" said George, with a significant look; and Harris and I agreed.    We had taken up an oil-stove once, but \"never again.\"  It had been like  living in an oil-shop that week.  It oozed.  I never saw such a thing as  paraffine oil is to ooze.  We kept it in the nose of the boat, and, from  there, it oozed down to the rudder, impregnating the whole boat and  everything in it on its way, and it oozed over the river, and saturated  the scenery and spoilt the atmosphere.  Sometimes a westerly oily wind  blew, and at other times an easterly oily wind, and sometimes it blew a  northerly oily wind, and maybe a southerly oily wind; but whether it came  from the Arctic snows, or was raised in the waste of the desert sands, it  came alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil.    And that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset; and as for the moonbeams,  they positively reeked of paraffine.    We tried to get away from it at Marlow.  We left the boat by the bridge,  and took a walk through the town to escape it, but it followed us.  The  whole town was full of oil.  We passed through the church-yard, and it  seemed as if the people had been buried in oil.  The High Street stunk of  oil; we wondered how people could live in it.  And we walked miles upon  miles out Birmingham way; but it was no use, the country was steeped in  oil.    At the end of that trip we met together at midnight in a lonely field,  under a blasted oak, and took an awful oath (we had been swearing for a  whole week about the thing in an ordinary, middle-class way, but this was  a swell affair)--an awful oath never to take paraffine oil with us in a  boat again-except, of course, in case of sickness.    Therefore, in the present instance, we confined ourselves to methylated  spirit.  Even that is bad enough.  You get methylated pie and methylated  cake.  But methylated spirit is more wholesome when taken into the system  in large quantities than paraffine oil.    For other breakfast things, George suggested eggs and bacon, which were  easy to cook, cold meat, tea, bread and butter, and jam.  For lunch, he  said, we could have biscuits, cold meat, bread and butter, and jam--but  _no cheese_.  Cheese, like oil, makes too much of itself.  It wants the  whole boat to itself.  It goes through the hamper, and gives a cheesy  flavour to everything else there.  You can't tell whether you are eating  apple-pie or German sausage, or strawberries and cream.  It all seems  cheese.  There is too much odour about cheese.    I remember a friend of mine, buying a couple of cheeses at Liverpool.  Splendid cheeses they were, ripe and mellow, and with a two hundred  horse-power scent about them that might have been warranted to carry  three miles, and knock a man over at two hundred yards.  I was in  Liverpool at the time, and my friend said that if I didn't mind he would  get me to take them back with me to London, as he should not be coming up  for a day or two himself, and he did not think the cheeses ought to be  kept much longer.    \"Oh, with pleasure, dear boy,\" I replied, \"with pleasure.\"    I called for the cheeses, and took them away in a cab.  It was a  ramshackle affair, dragged along by a knock-kneed, broken-winded  somnambulist, which his owner, in a moment of enthusiasm, during  conversation, referred to as a horse.  I put the cheeses on the top, and  we started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the swiftest  steam-roller ever built, and all went merry as a funeral bell, until we  turned the corner.  There, the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full  on to our steed.  It woke him up, and, with a snort of terror, he dashed  off at three miles an hour.  The wind still blew in his direction, and  before we reached the end of the street he was laying himself out at the  rate of nearly four miles an hour, leaving the cripples and stout old  ladies simply nowhere.    It took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at the station;  and I do not think they would have done it, even then, had not one of the  men had the presence of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose, and to  light a bit of brown paper.    I took my ticket, and marched proudly up the platform, with my cheeses,  the people falling back respectfully on either side.  The train was  crowded, and I had to get into a carriage where there were already seven  other people.  One crusty old gentleman objected, but I got in,  notwithstanding; and, putting my cheeses upon the rack, squeezed down  with a pleasant smile, and said it was a warm day.    A few moments passed, and then the old gentleman began to fidget.    \"Very close in here,\" he said.    \"Quite oppressive,\" said the man next him.    And then they both began sniffing, and, at the third sniff, they caught  it right on the chest, and rose up without another word and went out.  And then a stout lady got up, and said it was disgraceful that a  respectable married woman should be harried about in this way, and  gathered up a bag and eight parcels and went.  The remaining four  passengers sat on for a while, until a solemn-looking man in the corner,  who, from his dress and general appearance, seemed to belong to the  undertaker class, said it put him in mind of dead baby; and the other  three passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time, and hurt  themselves.                           [Picture: Railway carriage]    I smiled at the black gentleman, and said I thought we were going to have  the carriage to ourselves; and he laughed pleasantly, and said that some  people made such a fuss over a little thing.  But even he grew strangely  depressed after we had started, and so, when we reached Crewe, I asked  him to come and have a drink.  He accepted, and we forced our way into  the buffet, where we yelled, and stamped, and waved our umbrellas for a  quarter of an hour; and then a young lady came, and asked us if we wanted  anything.    \"What's yours?\" I said, turning to my friend.    \"I'll have half-a-crown's worth of brandy, neat, if you please, miss,\" he  responded.    And he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into another  carriage, which I thought mean.    From Crewe I had the compartment to myself, though the train was crowded.  As we drew up at the different stations, the people, seeing my empty  carriage, would rush for it.  \"Here y' are, Maria; come along, plenty of  room.\"  \"All right, Tom; we'll get in here,\" they would shout.  And they  would run along, carrying heavy bags, and fight round the door to get in  first.  And one would open the door and mount the steps, and stagger back  into the arms of the man behind him; and they would all come and have a  sniff, and then droop off and squeeze into other carriages, or pay the  difference and go first.    From Euston, I took the cheeses down to my friend's house.  When his wife  came into the room she smelt round for an instant.  Then she said:    \"What is it?  Tell me the worst.\"    I said:    \"It's cheeses.  Tom bought them in Liverpool, and asked me to bring them  up with me.\"    And I added that I hoped she understood that it had nothing to do with  me; and she said that she was sure of that, but that she would speak to  Tom about it when he came back.    My friend was detained in Liverpool longer than he expected; and, three  days later, as he hadn't returned home, his wife called on me.  She said:    \"What did Tom say about those cheeses?\"    I replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist place, and  that nobody was to touch them.    She said:    \"Nobody's likely to touch them.  Had he smelt them?\"    I thought he had, and added that he seemed greatly attached to them.    \"You think he would be upset,\" she queried, \"if I gave a man a sovereign  to take them away and bury them?\"    I answered that I thought he would never smile again.    An idea struck her.  She said:    \"Do you mind keeping them for him?  Let me send them round to you.\"    \"Madam,\" I replied, \"for myself I like the smell of cheese, and the  journey the other day with them from Liverpool I shall ever look back  upon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday.  But, in this world, we  must consider others.  The lady under whose roof I have the honour of  residing is a widow, and, for all I know, possibly an orphan too.  She  has a strong, I may say an eloquent, objection to being what she terms  'put upon.'  The presence of your husband's cheeses in her house she  would, I instinctively feel, regard as a 'put upon'; and it shall never  be said that I put upon the widow and the orphan.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said my friend's wife, rising, \"all I have to say is,  that I shall take the children and go to an hotel until those cheeses are  eaten.  I decline to live any longer in the same house with them.\"    She kept her word, leaving the place in charge of the charwoman, who,  when asked if she could stand the smell, replied, \"What smell?\" and who,  when taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard, said she could  detect a faint odour of melons.  It was argued from this that little  injury could result to the woman from the atmosphere, and she was left.    The hotel bill came to fifteen guineas; and my friend, after reckoning  everything up, found that the cheeses had cost him eight-and-sixpence a  pound.  He said he dearly loved a bit of cheese, but it was beyond his  means; so he determined to get rid of them.  He threw them into the  canal; but had to fish them out again, as the bargemen complained.  They  said it made them feel quite faint.  And, after that, he took them one  dark night and left them in the parish mortuary.  But the coroner  discovered them, and made a fearful fuss.    He"]]]
