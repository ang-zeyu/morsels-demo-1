However, I still keep a careful description of it, which I took  down on the spot, and which I expect some future golden-wing to verify.    But the most celebrated of the warblers in this regard is the  golden-crowned thrush, otherwise called the oven-bird and the wood  wagtail. His ordinary effort is one of the noisiest, least melodious,  and most incessant sounds to be heard in our woods. His _song_ is  another matter. For that he takes to the air (usually starting from a  tree-top, although I have seen him rise from the ground), whence, after  a preliminary _chip_, _chip_, he lets fall a hurried flood of notes, in  the midst of which can usually be distinguished his familiar _weechee_,  _weechee_, _weechee_. It is nothing wonderful that he should sing on  the wing,--many other birds do the same, and very much better than he;  but he is singular in that he strictly reserves his aerial music for  late in the afternoon. I have heard it as early as three o'clock, but  never before that, and it is most common about sunset. Writers speak of  it as limited to the season of courtship; but I have heard it almost  daily till near the end of July, and once, for my special benefit,  perhaps, it was given in full--and repeated--on the first day of  September. But who taught the little creature to do this,--to sing one  song in the forenoon, perched upon a twig, and to keep another for  afternoon, singing that invariably on the wing? and what difference is  there between the two in the mind of the singer?[5]    It is an indiscretion ever to say of a bird that he has only such and  such notes. You may have been his friend for years, but the next time  you go into the woods he will likely enough put you to shame by singing  something not so much as hinted at in your description. I thought I knew  the song of the yellow-rumped warbler, having listened to it many  times,--a slight and rather characterless thing, nowise remarkable. But  coming down Mount Willard one day in June, I heard a warbler's song  which brought me to a sudden halt. It was new and beautiful,--more  beautiful, it seemed at the moment, than any warbler's song I had ever  heard. What could it be? A little patient waiting (while the black-flies  and mosquitoes \"came upon me to eat up my flesh\"), and the wonderful  stranger appeared in full view,--my old acquaintance, the yellow-rumped  warbler.    With all this strong tendency on the part of birds to vary their music,  how is it that there is still such a degree of uniformity, so that, as  we have said, every species may be recognized by its notes? Why does  every red-eyed vireo sing in one way, and every white-eyed vireo in  another? Who teaches the young chipper to trill, and the young linnet to  warble? In short, how do birds come by their music? Is it all a matter  of instinct, inherited habit, or do they learn it? The answer appears to  be that birds sing as children talk, by simple imitation. Nobody  imagines that the infant is born with a language printed upon his brain.  The father and mother may never have known a word of any tongue except  the English, but if the child is brought up to hear only Chinese, he  will infallibly speak that, and nothing else. And careful experiments  have shown the same to be true of birds.[6] Taken from the nest just  after they leave the shell, they invariably sing, not their own  so-called natural song, but the song of their foster-parents; provided,  of course, that this is not anything beyond their physical capacity. The  notorious house sparrow (our \"English\" sparrow), in his wild or  semi-domesticated state, never makes a musical sound; but if he is taken  in hand early enough, he may be taught to sing, so it is said, nearly as  well as the canary. Bechstein relates that a Paris clergyman had two of  these sparrows whom he had trained to speak, and, among other things, to  recite several of the shorter commandments; and the narrative goes on to  say that it was sometimes very comical, when the pair were disputing  over their food, to hear one gravely admonish the other, \"Thou shalt not  steal!\" It would be interesting to know why creatures thus gifted do not  sing of their own motion. With their amiability and sweet peaceableness  they ought to be caroling the whole year round.    This question of the transmission of songs from one generation to  another is, of course, a part of the general subject of animal  intelligence, a subject much discussed in these days on account of its  bearing upon the modern doctrine concerning the relation of man to the  inferior orders.    We have nothing to do with such a theme, but it may not be out of place  to suggest to preachers and moralists that here is a striking and  unhackneyed illustration of the force of early training. Birds sing by  imitation, it is true, but as a rule they imitate only the notes which  they hear during the first few weeks after they are hatched. One of Mr.  Barrington's linnets, for example, after being educated under a titlark,  was put into a room with two birds of his own species, where he heard  them sing freely every day for three months. He made no attempt to learn  anything from them, however, but kept on practicing what the titlark had  taught him, quite unconscious of anything singular or unpatriotic in  such a course. This law, that impressions received during the immaturity  of the powers become the unalterable habit of the after life, is perhaps  the most momentous of all the laws in whose power we find ourselves.  Sometimes we are tempted to call it cruel. But if it were annulled, this  would be a strange world. What a hurly-hurly we should have among the  birds! There would be no more telling them by their notes. Thrushes and  jays, wrens and chickadees, finches and warblers, all would be singing  one grand medley.    Between these two opposing tendencies, one urging to variation, the  other to permanence (for Nature herself is half radical, half  conservative), the language of birds has grown from rude beginnings to  its present beautiful diversity; and whoever lives a century of  millenniums hence will listen to music such as we in this day can only  dream of. Inappreciably but ceaselessly the work goes on. Here and there  is born a master-singer, a feathered genius, and every generation makes  its own addition to the glorious inheritance.    It may be doubted whether there is any real connection between moral  character and the possession of wings. Nevertheless there has long been  a popular feeling that some such congruity does exist; and certainly it  seems unreasonable to suppose that creatures who are able to soar at  will into the heavens should be without other equally angelic  attributes. But, be that as it may, our friends, the birds, do  undeniably set us a good example in several respects. To mention only  one, how becoming is their observance of morning and evening song! In  spite of their industrious spirit (and few of us labor more hours  daily), neither their first nor their last thoughts are given to the  question, What shall we eat, and what shall we drink? Possibly their  habit of saluting the rising and setting sun may be thought to favor the  theory that the worship of the god of day was the original religion. I  know nothing about that. But it would be a sad change if the birds,  declining from their present beautiful custom, were to sleep and work,  work and sleep, with no holy hour between, as is too much the case with  the being who, according to his own pharisaic notion, is the only  religious animal.    In the season, however, the woods are by no means silent, even at  noonday. Many species (such as the vireos and warblers, who get their  living amid the foliage of trees) sing as they work; while the thrushes  and others, who keep business and pleasure more distinct, are often too  happy to go many hours together without a hymn. I have even seen robins  singing without quitting the turf; but that is rather unusual, for  somehow birds have come to feel that they must get away from the ground  when the lyrical mood is upon them. This may be a thing of sentiment  (for is not language full of uncomplimentary allusions to earth and  earthliness?), but more likely it is prudential. The gift of song is no  doubt a dangerous blessing to creatures who have so many enemies, and we  can readily believe that they have found it safer to be up where they  can look about them while thus publishing their whereabouts.    A very interesting exception to this rule is the savanna sparrow, who  sings habitually from the ground. But even he shares the common feeling,  and stretches himself to his full height with an earnestness which is  almost laughable, in view of the result; for his notes are hardly louder  than a cricket's chirp. Probably he has fallen into this lowly habit  from living in meadows and salt marshes, where bushes and trees are not  readily to be come at; and it is worth noticing that, in the case of the  skylark and the white-winged blackbird, the same conditions have led to  a result precisely opposite. The sparrow, we may presume, was originally  of a humble disposition, and when nothing better offered itself for a  singing-perch easily grew accustomed to standing upon a stone or a  little lump of earth; and this practice, long persisted in, naturally  had the effect to lessen the loudness of his voice. The skylark, on the  other hand, when he did not readily find a tree-top, said to himself,  \"Never mind! I have a pair of wings.\" And so the lark is famous, while  the sparrow remains unheard-of, and is even mistaken for a  grasshopper.    How true it is that the very things which dishearten one nature and  break it down, only help another to find out what it was made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#6)"],[1," the internal law of  progress, certain beliefs have been inculcated, certain crimes  invented, in order to intimidate the masses. Hence, the Church made  free thought the worst of sins, and the spirit of inquiry the worst of  blasphemies; while the State proclaimed her temporal power of divine  origin, and all rebellion high treason alike to God and the king, to  be speedily and severely punished. In this union of Church and State  mankind touched the lowest depth of degradation. As late as the time  of Bunyan the chief doctrine inculcated from the pulpit was obedience  to the temporal power.    All these influences fell with crushing weight on woman; more  sensitive, helpless, and imaginative, she suffered a thousand fears  and wrongs where man did one. Lecky, in his \"History of Rationalism in  Europe,\" shows that the vast majority of the victims of fanaticism and  witchcraft, burned, drowned, and tortured, were women. Guizot, in his  \"History of Civilization,\" while decrying the influence of caste in  India, and deploring it as the result of barbarism, thanks God there  is no system of caste in Europe; ignoring the fact that in all its  dire and baneful effects, the caste of sex everywhere exists, creating  diverse codes of morals for men and women, diverse penalties for  crime, diverse industries, diverse religions and educational rights,  and diverse relations to the Government. Men are the Brahmins, women  the Pariahs, under our existing civilization. Herbert Spencer's  \"Descriptive Sociology of England,\" an epitome of English history,  says: \"Our laws are based on the all-sufficiency of man's rights, and  society exists to-day for woman only in so far as she is in the  keeping of some man.\" Thus society, including our systems of  jurisprudence, civil and political theories, trade, commerce,  education, religion, friendships, and family life, have all been  framed on the sole idea of man's rights. Hence, he takes upon himself  the responsibility of directing and controlling the powers of woman,  under that all-sufficient excuse of tyranny, \"divine right.\" This same  cry of divine authority created the castes of India; has for ages  separated its people into bodies, with different industrial,  educational, civil, religious, and political rights; has maintained  this separation for the benefit of the superior class, and sedulously  taught the doctrine that any change in existing conditions would be a  sin of most direful magnitude.    The opposition of theologians, though first to be exhibited when any  change is proposed, for reason that change not only takes power from  them, but lessens the reverence of mankind for them, is not in its  final result so much to be feared as the opposition of those holding  political power. The Church, knowing this, has in all ages aimed to  connect itself with the State. Political freedom guarantees religious  liberty, freedom to worship God according to the dictates of one's own  conscience, fosters a spirit of inquiry, creates self-reliance,  induces a feeling of responsibility.    The people who demand authority for every thought and action, who look  to others for wisdom and protection, are those who perpetuate tyranny.  The thinkers and actors who find their authority within, are those who  inaugurate freedom. Obedience to outside authority to which woman has  everywhere been trained, has not only dwarfed her capacity, but made  her a retarding force in civilization, recognized at last by statesmen  as a dangerous element to free institutions. A recent writer, speaking  of Turkey, says: \"All attempts for the improvement of that nation must  prove futile, owing to the degradation of its women; and their  elevation is hopeless so long as they are taught by their religion  that their condition is ordained of heaven.\" Gladstone, in one of his  pamphlets on the revival of Catholicism in England, says: \"The spread  of this religion is due, as might be expected, to woman;\" thus  conceding in both cases her power to block the wheels of progress.  Hence, in the scientific education of woman, in the training of her  faculties to independent thought and logical reasoning, lies the hope  of the future.    The two great sources of progress are intellect and wealth. Both  represent power, and are the elements of success in life. Education  frees the mind from the bondage of authority and makes the individual  self-asserting. Remunerative industry is the means of securing to its  possessor wealth and education, transforming the laborer to the  capitalist. Work in itself is not power; it is but the means to an  end. The slave is not benefited by his industry; he does not receive  the results of his toil; his labor enriches another--adds to the power  of his master to bind his chains still closer. Although woman has  performed much of the labor of the world, her industry and economy  have been the very means of increasing her degradation. Not being  free, the results of her labor have gone to build up and sustain the  very class that has perpetuated this injustice. Even in the family,  where we should naturally look for the truest conditions, woman has  always been robbed of the fruits of her own toil. The influence the  Catholic Church has had on religious free thought, that monarchies  have had on political free thought, that serfdom has had upon free  labor, have all been cumulative in the family upon woman. Taught that  father and husband stood to her in the place of God, she has been  denied liberty of conscience, and held in obedience to masculine will.  Taught that the fruits of her industry belonged to others, she has  seen man enter into every avocation most suitable to her, while she,  the uncomplaining drudge of the household, condemned to the severest  labor, has been systematically robbed of her earnings, which have gone  to build up her master's power, and she has found herself in the  condition of the slave, deprived of the results of her own labor.  Taught that education for her was indelicate and irreligious, she has  been kept in such gross ignorance as to fall a prey to superstition,  and to glory in her own degradation. Taught that a low voice is an  excellent thing in woman, she has been trained to a subjugation of the  vocal organs, and thus lost the benefit of loud tones and their  well-known invigoration of the system. Forbidden to run, climb, or  jump, her muscles have been weakened, and her strength deteriorated.  Confined most of the time to the house, she has neither as strong  lungs nor as vigorous a digestion as her brother. Forbidden to enter  the pulpit, she has been trained to an unquestioning reverence for  theological authority and false belief upon the most vital interests  of religion. Forbidden the medical profession, she has at the most  sacred times of her life been left to the ignorant supervision of male  physicians, and seen her young children die by thousands. Forbidden to  enter the courts, she has seen her sex unjustly tried and condemned  for crimes men were incapable of judging.    Woman has been the great unpaid laborer of the world, and although  within the last two decades a vast number of new employments have been  opened to her, statistics prove that in the great majority of these,  she is not paid according to the value of the work done, but according  to sex. The opening of all industries to woman, and the wage question  as connected with her, are most subtle and profound questions of  political economy, closely interwoven with the rights of  self-government.    The revival of learning had its influence upon woman, and we find in  the early part of the fourteenth century a decided tendency toward a  recognition of her equality. Christine of Pisa, the most eminent woman  of this period, supported a family of six persons by her pen, taking  high ground on the conservation of morals in opposition to the general  licentious spirit of the age. Margaret of Angouleme, the brilliant  Queen of Navarre, was a voluminous writer, her Heptameron rising to  the dignity of a French classic. A paper in the _Revue des Deux  Mondes_, a few years since, by M. Henri Baudrillart, upon the  \"Emancipation of Woman,\" recalls the fact that for nearly four hundred  years, men, too, have been ardent believers in equal rights for woman.    In 1509, Cornelius Agrippa, a great literary authority of his time,  published a work of this character. Agrippa was not content with  claiming woman's equality, but in a work of thirty chapters devoted  himself to proving \"the superiority of woman.\" In less than fifty  years (1552) Ruscelli brought out a similar work based on the Platonic  Philosophy. In 1599, Anthony Gibson wrote a book which in the prolix  phraseology of the times was called, \"A Woman's Worth defended against  all the Men in the World, proving to be more Perfect, Excellent, and  Absolute, in all Virtuous Actions, than any man of What Quality  Soever.\" While these sturdy male defenders of the rights of woman met  with many opponents, some going so far as to assert that women were  beings not endowed with reason, they were sustained by many vigorous  writers among women. Italy, then the foremost literary country of  Europe, possessed many women of learning, one of whom, Lucrezia  Morinella, a Venetian lady, wrote a work entitled, \"The Nobleness and  Excellence of Women, together with the Faults and Imperfections of  Men.\"    The seventeenth century gave birth to many essays and books of a like  character, not confined to the laity, as several friars wrote upon the  same subject. In 1696, Daniel De Foe wished to have an institute  founded for the better education of young women. He said: \"We reproach  the sex every day for folly and impertinence, while I am confident had  they the advantages of education equal to us, they would be guilty of  less than ourselves.\" Alexander's History of Women, John Paul Ribera's  work upon Women, the two huge quartos of"]]]
