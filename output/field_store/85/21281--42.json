Esterbrook Elliott unpinned with a masterful touch the delicate  cluster of Noisette rosebuds she wore at her throat and transferred  them to his buttonhole as he answered courteously: \"Certainly. My  time, as you know, is entirely at your disposal.\"    They were standing in the garden under the creamy bloom of drooping  acacia trees. One long plume of blossoms touched lightly the soft,  golden-brown coils of the girl's hair and cast a wavering shadow over  the beautiful, flower-like face beneath it.    Esterbrook Elliott, standing before her, thought proudly that he had  never seen a woman who might compare with her. In every detail she  satisfied his critical, fastidious taste. There was not a discordant  touch about her.    Esterbrook Elliott had always loved Marian Lesley--or thought he had.  They had grown up together from childhood. He was an only son and she  an only daughter. It had always been an understood thing between the  two families that the boy and girl should marry. But Marian's father  had decreed that no positive pledge should pass between them until  Marian was twenty-one.    Esterbrook accepted his mapped-out destiny and selected bride with the  conviction that he was an exceptionally lucky fellow. Out of all the  women in the world Marian was the very one whom he would have chosen  as mistress of his fine, old home. She had been his boyhood's ideal.  He believed that he loved her sincerely, but he was not too much in  love to be blind to the worldly advantages of his marriage with his  cousin.    His father had died two years previously, leaving him wealthy and  independent. Marian had lost her mother in childhood; her father died  when she was eighteen. Since then she had lived alone with her aunt.  Her life was quiet and lonely. Esterbrook's companionship was all that  brightened it, but it was enough. Marian lavished on him all the rich,  womanly love of her heart. On her twenty-first birthday they were  formally betrothed. They were to be married in the following autumn.    No shadow had drifted across the heaven of her happiness. She believed  herself secure in her lover's unfaltering devotion. True, at times she  thought his manner lacked a lover's passionate ardour. He was always  attentive and courteous. She had only to utter a wish to find that it  had been anticipated; he spent every spare minute at her side.    Yet sometimes she half wished he would betray more lover-like  impatience and intensity. Were all lovers as calm and undemonstrative?    She reproached herself for this incipient disloyalty as often as it  vexingly intruded its unwelcome presence across her inner  consciousness. Surely Esterbrook was fond and devoted enough to  satisfy the most exacting demands of affection. Marian herself was  somewhat undemonstrative and reserved. Passing acquaintances called  her cold and proud. Only the privileged few knew the rich depths of  womanly tenderness in her nature.    Esterbrook thought that he fully appreciated her. As he had walked  homeward the night of their betrothal, he had reviewed with  unconscious criticism his mental catalogue of Marian's graces and good  qualities, admitting, with supreme satisfaction, that there was not  one thing about her that he could wish changed.    This afternoon, under the acacias, they had been planning about their  wedding. There was no one to consult but themselves.    They were to be married early in September and then go abroad.  Esterbrook mapped out the details of their bridal tour with careful  thoughtfulness. They would visit all the old-world places that Marian  wished to see. Afterwards they would come back home. He discussed  certain changes he wished to make in the old Elliott mansion to fit it  for a young and beautiful mistress.    He did most of the planning. Marian was content to listen in happy  silence. Afterwards she had proposed this walk to the Cove.    \"What particular object of charity have you found at the Cove now?\"  asked Esterbrook, with lazy interest, as they walked along.    \"Mrs. Barrett's little Bessie is very ill with fever,\" answered  Marian. Then, catching his anxious look, she hastened to add, \"It is  nothing infectious--some kind of a slow, sapping variety. There is no  danger, Esterbrook.\"    \"I was not afraid for myself,\" he replied quietly. \"My alarm was for  you. You are too precious to me, Marian, for me to permit you to risk  health and life, if it were dangerous. What a Lady Bountiful you are  to those people at the Cove. When we are married you must take me in  hand and teach me your creed of charity. I'm afraid I've lived a  rather selfish life. You will change all that, dear. You will make a  good man of me.\"    \"You are that now, Esterbrook,\" she said softly. \"If you were not, I  could not love you.\"    \"It is a negative sort of goodness, I fear. I have never been tried or  tempted severely. Perhaps I should fail under the test.\"    \"I am sure you would not,\" answered Marian proudly.    Esterbrook laughed; her faith in him was pleasant. He had no thought  but that he would prove worthy of it.    The Cove, so-called, was a little fishing hamlet situated on the low,  sandy shore of a small bay. The houses, clustered in one spot, seemed  like nothing so much as larger shells washed up by the sea, so grey  and bleached were they from long exposure to sea winds and spray.    Dozens of ragged children were playing about them, mingled with  several disreputable yellow curs that yapped noisily at the strangers.    Down on the sandy strip of beach below the houses groups of men were  lounging about. The mackerel, season had not yet set in; the spring  herring netting was past. It was holiday time among the sea folks.  They were enjoying it to the full, a happy, ragged colony, careless of  what the morrows might bring forth.    Out beyond, the boats were at anchor, floating as gracefully on the  twinkling water as sea birds, their tall masts bowing landward on the  swell. A lazy, dreamful calm had fallen over the distant seas; the  horizon blues were pale and dim; faint purple hazes blurred the  outlines of far-off headlands and cliffs; the yellow sands sparkled in  the sunshine as if powdered with jewels.    A murmurous babble of life buzzed about the hamlet, pierced through by  the shrill undertones of the wrangling children, most of whom had  paused in their play to scan the visitors with covert curiosity.    Marian led the way to a house apart from the others at the very edge  of the shelving rock. The dooryard was scrupulously clean and  unlittered; the little footpath through it was neatly bordered by  white clam shells; several thrifty geraniums in bloom looked out from  the muslin-curtained windows.    A weary-faced woman came forward to meet them.    \"Bessie's much the same, Miss Lesley,\" she said, in answer to Marian's  inquiry. \"The doctor you sent was here today and did all he could for  her. He seemed quite hopeful. She don't complain or nothing--just lies  there and moans. Sometimes she gets restless. It's very kind of you to  come so often, Miss Lesley. Here, Magdalen, will you put this basket  the lady's brought up there on the shelf?\"    A girl, who had been sitting unnoticed with her back to the visitors,  at the head of the child's cot in one corner of the room, stood up and  slowly turned around. Marian and Esterbrook Elliott both started with  involuntary surprise. Esterbrook caught his breath like a man suddenly  awakened from sleep. In the name of all that was wonderful, who or  what could this girl be, so little in harmony with her surroundings?    Standing in the crepuscular light of the corner, her marvellous beauty  shone out with the vivid richness of some rare painting. She was tall,  and the magnificent proportions of her figure were enhanced rather  than marred by the severely plain dress of dark print that she wore.  The heavy masses of her hair, a shining auburn dashed with golden  foam, were coiled in a rich, glossy knot at the back of the  classically modelled head and rippled back from a low brow whose waxen  fairness even the breezes of the ocean had spared.    The girl's face was a full, perfect oval, with features of faultless  regularity, and the large, full eyes were of tawny hazel, darkened  into inscrutable gloom in the dimness of the corner.    Not even Marian Lesley's face was more delicately tinted, but not a  trace of colour appeared in the smooth, marble-like cheeks; yet the  waxen pallor bore no trace of disease or weakness, and the large,  curving mouth was of an intense crimson.    She stood quite motionless. There was no trace of embarrassment or  self-consciousness in her pose. When Mrs. Barrett said, \"This is my  niece, Magdalen Crawford,\" she merely inclined her head in grave,  silent acknowledgement. As she moved forward to take Marian's basket,  she seemed oddly out of place in the low, crowded room. Her presence  seemed to throw a strange restraint over the group.    Marian rose and went over to the cot, laying her slender hand on the  hot forehead of the little sufferer. The child opened its brown eyes  questioningly.    \"How are you today, Bessie?\"    \"Mad'len--I want Mad'len,\" moaned the little plaintive voice.    Magdalen came over and stood beside Marian Lesley.    \"She wants me,\" she said in a low, thrilling voice; free from all  harsh accent or intonation. \"I am the only one she seems to know  always. Yes, darling, Mad'len is here--right beside you. She will not  leave you.\"    She knelt by the little cot and passed her arm under the child's neck,  drawing the curly head close to her throat with a tender, soothing  motion.    Esterbrook Elliott watched the two women intently--the one standing by  the cot, arrayed in simple yet costly apparel, with her beautiful,  high-bred face, and the other, kneeling on the bare, sanded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#6)"],[1,"share of that, and she soon discovered  that her family's estimate of James Sheldon had been the true one.  There was no active resentment on either side, and once in a long  while letters were exchanged. Still, ever since her marriage,  Elizabeth had been practically an outsider and an alien. As the years  came and went the Ingelows at home remembered only at long intervals  that they had a sister on the western prairies.    One of these remembrances came to Charlotte Ingelow on a spring  afternoon when the great orchards about the Grange were pink and white  with apple and cherry blossoms, and over every hill and field was a  delicate, flower-starred green. A soft breeze was blowing loose petals  from the August Sweeting through the open door of the wide hall when  Charlotte came through it. Ellen and George were standing on the steps  outside.    \"This kind of a day always makes me think of Elizabeth,\" said  Charlotte dreamily. \"It was in apple-blossom time she went away.\" The  Ingelows always spoke of Elizabeth's going away, never of her  marrying.    \"Seventeen years ago,\" said Ellen. \"Why, Elizabeth's oldest child must  be quite a young woman now! I--I--\" a sudden idea swept over and left  her a little breathless. \"I would really like to see her.\"    \"Then why don't you write and ask her to come east and visit us?\"  asked George, who did not often speak, but who always spoke to some  purpose when he did.    Ellen and Charlotte looked at each other. \"I would like to see  Elizabeth's child,\" repeated Ellen firmly.    \"Do you think she would come?\" asked Charlotte. \"You know when James  Sheldon died five years ago, we wrote to Elizabeth and asked her to  come home and live with us, and she seemed almost resentful in the  letter she wrote back. I've never said so before, but I've often  thought it.\"    \"Yes, she did,\" said Ellen, who had often thought so too, but never  said so.    \"Elizabeth was always very independent,\" remarked George. \"Perhaps she  thought your letter savoured of charity or pity. No Ingelow would  endure that.\"    \"At any rate, you know she refused to come, even for a visit. She said  she could not leave the farm. She may refuse to let her child come.\"    \"It won't do any harm to ask her,\" said George.    In the end, Charlotte wrote to Elizabeth and asked her to let her  daughter visit the old homestead. The letter was written and mailed in  much perplexity and distrust when once the glow of momentary  enthusiasm in the new idea had passed.    \"What if Elizabeth's child is like her father?\" queried Charlotte in a  half-whisper.    \"Let us hope she won't be!\" cried Ellen fervently. Indeed, she felt  that a feminine edition of James Sheldon would be more than she could  endure.    \"She may not like us, or our ways,\" sighed Charlotte. \"We don't know  how she has been brought up. She will seem like a stranger after all.  I really long to see Elizabeth's child, but I can't help fearing we  have done a rash thing, Ellen.\"    \"Perhaps she may not come,\" suggested Ellen, wondering whether she  hoped it or feared it.    But Worth Sheldon did come. Elizabeth wrote back a prompt acceptance,  with no trace of the proud bitterness that had permeated her answer to  the former invitation. The Ingelows at the Grange were thrown into a  flutter when the letter came. In another week Elizabeth's child would  be with them.    \"If only she isn't like her father,\" said Charlotte with foreboding,  as she aired and swept the southeast spare room for their expected  guest. They had three spare rooms at the Grange, but the aunts had  selected the southeast one for their niece because it was done in  white, \"and white seems the most appropriate for a young girl,\" Ellen  said, as she arranged a pitcher of wild roses on the table.    \"I think everything is ready,\" announced Charlotte. \"I put the very  finest sheets on the bed, they smell deliciously of lavender, and we  had very good luck doing up the muslin curtains. It is pleasant to be  expecting a guest, isn't it, Ellen? I have often thought, although I  have never said so before, that our lives were too self-centred. We  seemed to have no interests outside of ourselves. Even Elizabeth has  been really nothing to us, you know. She seemed to have become a  stranger. I hope her child will be the means of bringing us nearer  together again.\"    \"If she has James Sheldon's round face and big blue eyes and curly  yellow hair I shall never really like her, no matter how Ingelowish  she may be inside,\" said Ellen decidedly.    When Worth Sheldon came, each of her aunts drew a long breath of  relief. Worth was not in the least like her father in appearance.  Neither did she resemble her mother, who had been a sprightly,  black-haired and black-eyed girl. Worth was tall and straight, with a  long braid of thick, wavy brown hair, large, level-gazing grey eyes, a  square jaw, and an excellent chin with a dimple in it.    \"She is the very image of Mother's sister, Aunt Alice, who died so  long ago,\" said Charlotte. \"You don't remember her, Ellen, but I do  very well. She was the sweetest woman that ever drew breath. She was  Paul's favourite aunt, too,\" Charlotte added with a sigh. Paul's  antagonistic attitude was the only drawback to the joy of this  meeting. How delightful it would have been if he had not refused to be  there too, to welcome Elizabeth's child.    Worth came to hearts prepared to love her, but they must have loved  her in any case. In a day Aunt Charlotte and Aunt Ellen and shy,  quiet Uncle George had yielded wholly to her charm. She was girlishly  bright and merry, frankly delighted with the old homestead and the  quaint, old-fashioned, daintily kept rooms. Yet there was no  suggestion of gush about her; she did not go into raptures, but her  pleasure shone out in eyes and tones. There was so much to tell and  ask and remember the first day that it was not until the second  morning after her arrival that Worth asked the question her aunts had  been dreading. She asked it out in the orchard, in the emerald gloom  of a long arcade of stout old trees that Grandfather Ingelow had  planted fifty years ago.    \"Aunt Charlotte, when is Uncle Paul coming up to see me? I long to see  him; Mother has talked so much to me about him. She was his favourite  sister, wasn't she?\"    Charlotte and Ellen looked at each other. Ellen nodded slyly. It would  be better to tell Worth the whole truth at once. She would certainly  find it out soon.    \"I do not think, my dear,\" said Aunt Charlotte quietly, \"that your  Uncle Paul will be up to see you at all.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Worth, her serious grey eyes looking straight into  Aunt Charlotte's troubled dark ones. Aunt Charlotte understood that  Elizabeth had never told Worth anything about her family's resentment  of her marriage. It was not a pleasant thing to have to explain it all  to Elizabeth's child, but it must be done.    \"I think, my dear,\" she said gently, \"that I will have to tell you a  little bit of our family history that may not be very pleasant to hear  or tell. Perhaps you don't know that when your mother married  we--we--did not exactly approve of her marriage. Perhaps we were  mistaken; at any rate it was wrong and foolish to let it come between  us and her as we have done. But that is how it was. None of us  approved, as I have said, but none of us was so bitter as your Uncle  Paul. Your mother was his favourite sister, and he was very deeply  attached to her. She was only a year younger than he. When he bought  the Greenwood farm she went and kept house for him for three years  before her marriage. When she married, Paul was terribly angry. He was  always a strange man, very determined and unyielding. He said he would  never forgive her, and he never has. He has never married, and he has  lived so long alone at Greenwood with only deaf old Mrs. Bree to keep  house for him that he has grown odder than ever. One of us wanted to  go and keep house for him, but he would not let us. And--I must tell  you this although I hate to--he was very angry when he heard we had  invited you to visit us, and he said he would not come near the Grange  as long as you were here. Oh, you can't realize how bitter and  obstinate he is. We pleaded with him, but I think that only made him  worse. We have felt so bad over it, your Aunt Ellen and your Uncle  George and I, but we can do nothing at all.\"    Worth had listened gravely. The story was all new to her, but she had  long thought there must be a something at the root of her mother's  indifferent relations with her old home and friends. When Aunt  Charlotte, flushed and half-tearful, finished speaking, a little  glimmer of fun came into Worth's grey eyes, and her dimple was very  pronounced as she said,    \"Then, if Uncle Paul will not come to see me, I must go to see him.\"    \"My dear!\" cried both her aunts together in dismay. Aunt Ellen got her  breath first.    \"Oh, my dear child, you must not think of such a thing,\" she cried  nervously. \"It would never do. He would--I don't know what he would  do--order you off the premises, or say something dreadful. No! No!  Wait. Perhaps he will come after all--we will see. You must have  patience.\"    Worth shook her head and the smile in her eyes deepened.    \"I don't think he will come,\" she said. \"Mother has told me something  about the Ingelow stubbornness. She says I have it in full measure,  but I like to call it determination, it sounds so much better. No, the  mountain will not come to Mohammed, so Mohammed will go to the  mountain. I think I will walk down to Greenwood this afternoon. There,  dear aunties, don't look so troubled. Uncle Paul won't run at me with  a pitchfork, will he? He can't do worse than order me off his  premises, as you say.\"    Aunt Charlotte shook her head. She understood that no argument would  turn the girl from her purpose if she had the Ingelow will, so she  said nothing more. In the"]]]
