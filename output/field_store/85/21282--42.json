Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a  gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple.    \"Thank you,\" she said.    \"You are not going yet,\" said Murray resolutely. \"The time I saved you  in milking three cows belongs to me. We will spend it in a walk along  the pond shore. I will show you a path I have discovered under the  beeches. It is just wide enough for two. Come.\"    He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane,  where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters  plashed dreamily below them. He kept her hand in his as they went down  the path, and she did not try to withdraw it. About them was the  great, pure silence of the morning, faintly threaded with caressing  sounds--croon of birds, gurgle of waters, sough of wind. The spirit of  youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word.    When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early  sunshine and arched over by maples, with the wide shimmer of the pond  before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass, the girl drew  a long breath of delight.    \"It is a morning left over from Eden, isn't it?\" said Murray.    \"Yes,\" said Mollie softly.    Murray bent toward her. \"You are Eve,\" he said. \"You are the only  woman in the world--for me. Adam must have told Eve just what he  thought about her the first time he saw her. There were no  conventionalities in Eden--and people could not have taken long to  make up their minds. We are in Eden just now. One can say what he  thinks in Eden without being ridiculous. You are divinely fair, Eve.  Your eyes are stars of the morning--your cheek has the flush it stole  from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise. And  I love you, Eve.\"    Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a  burnished semi-circle on her cheek.    \"I think,\" she said slowly, \"that it must have been very delightful in  Eden. But we are not really there, you know--we are only playing that  we are. And it is time for me to go back. I must get the  breakfast--that sounds too prosaic for paradise.\"    Murray bent still closer.    \"Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise, will you  kiss me, dear Eve?\"    \"You are very audacious,\" said Mollie coldly.    \"We are in Eden yet,\" he urged. \"That makes all the difference.\"    \"Well,\" said Mollie. And Murray kissed her.    They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before  either spoke again. Then Murray said, \"We have left Eden behind--but  we can always return there when we will. And although we were only  playing at paradise, I was not playing at love. I meant all I said,  Mollie.\"    \"Have you meant it often?\" asked Mollie significantly.    \"I never meant it--or even played at it--before,\" he answered. \"I  did--at one time--contemplate the possibility of playing at it. But  that was long ago--as long ago as last night. I am glad to the core of  my soul that I decided against it before I met you, dear Eve. I have  the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment. I mean to mail  it this afternoon.\"    \"'Curiosity knows no gender,'\" quoted Mollie.    \"Then, to satisfy your curiosity, I must bore you with some personal  history. My parents died when I was a little chap, and my uncle  brought me up. He has been immensely good to me, but he is a bit of a  tyrant. Recently he picked out a wife for me--the daughter of an old  sweetheart of his. I have never even seen her. But she has arrived in  town on a visit to some relatives there. Uncle Dick wrote to me to  return home at once and pay my court to the lady; I protested. He  wrote again--a letter, short and the reverse of sweet. If I refused to  do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me--never speak to me  again--cut me off with a quarter. Uncle always means what he  says--that is one of our family traits, you understand. I spent some  miserable, undecided days. It was not the threat of disinheritance  that worried me, although when you have been brought up to regard  yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust  your vision to a pauper focus. But it was the thought of alienating  Uncle Dick. I love the dear, determined old chap like a father. But  last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my  own man. So I wrote to Uncle Dick, respectfully but firmly declining  to become a candidate for Miss Mannering's hand.\"    \"But you have never seen her,\" said Mollie. \"She may  be--almost--charming.\"    \"'If she be not fair to me, what care I how fair she be?'\" quoted  Murray. \"As you say, she may be--almost charming; but she is not Eve.  She is merely one of a million other women, as far as I am concerned.  Don't let's talk of her. Let us talk only of ourselves--there is  nothing else that is half so interesting.\"    \"And will your uncle really cast you off?\" asked Mollie.    \"Not a doubt of it.\"    \"What will you do?\"    \"Work, dear Eve. My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the  winds and I shall work. That is the rule outside of Eden. Don't worry.  I've painted pictures that have actually been sold. I'll make a living  for us somehow.\"    \"Us?\"    \"Of course. You are engaged to me.\"    \"I am not,\" said Mollie indignantly.    \"Mollie! Mollie! After that kiss! Fie, fie!\"    \"You are very absurd,\" said Mollie, \"But your absurdity has been  amusing. I have--yes, positively--I have enjoyed your Eden comedy. But  now you must not come any further with me. My aunt might not approve.  Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse. There, I presume, is yours  to Sweetbriar Cottage. Good morning.\"    \"I am coming over to see you this afternoon,\" said Murray coolly. \"But  you needn't be afraid. I will not tell tales out of Eden. I will be a  hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before.  But you and I will know and remember. Now, you may go. I reserve to  myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight.\"           *       *       *       *       *    That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob, going into the  kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world.  Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound  about her head, but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty, very  plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve  on the range.    \"Good afternoon, Mrs. Palmer,\" said Murray, wondering where Mollie  was. \"I'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid.\"    \"I've a raging, ramping headache,\" said Mrs. Palmer solemnly. \"I had  it all night and I'm good for nothing. Mollie, you'd better take them  cherries off. Mr. Murray, this is my niece, Mollie Booth.\"    \"What?\" said Murray explosively.    \"Miss Mollie Booth,\" repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone.    Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie.    \"And what about Eve?\" he thought helplessly. \"Who--what was she? Did I  dream her? Was she a phantom of delight? No, no, phantoms don't milk  cows. She was flesh and blood. No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists  of the marsh could have given a kiss like that.\"    \"Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me,\" said Mrs.  Palmer. \"I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over  at last. They have made a wreck of me.\"    Murray rapidly reflected. This development, he decided, released him  from his promise to tell no tales. \"I met a young lady down in the  pond pasture this morning,\" he said deliberately. \"I talked with her  for a few minutes. I supposed her to be your niece. Who was she?\"    \"Oh, that was Miss Mannering,\" said Mrs. Palmer.    \"What?\" said Murray again.    \"Mannering--Dora Mannering,\" said Mrs. Palmer loudly, wondering if Mr.  Murray were losing his hearing. \"She came here last night just to see  me. I haven't seen her since she was a child of twelve. I used to be  her nurse before I was married. I was that proud to think she thought  it worth her while to look me up. And, mind you, this morning, when  she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand's turn,  that girl, Mr. Murray, went and milked seven cows\"--\"only four,\"  murmured Murray, but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him--\"for me. Couldn't  prevent her. She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when  she was in the country, and she did it. And then she got breakfast for  the men--Mollie didn't come till the ten o'clock train. Miss Mannering  is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm.\"    \"Where is she now?\" demanded Murray.    \"Oh, she's gone.\"    \"What?\"    \"Gone,\" shouted Mrs. Palmer, \"gone. She left on the train Mollie come  on. Gracious me, has the man gone crazy? He hasn't seemed like himself  at all this afternoon.\"    Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the  lane.    Blind fool--unspeakable idiot that he had been! To take her for Mrs.  Palmer's niece--that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any  situation, which marked the woman of the world, with the fine  appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of  culture--to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth! He had been blind,  besottedly blind. And now he had lost her! She would never forgive  him; she had gone without a word or sign.    As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the  apple trees, a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope.    \"Mr. Murray, Mr. Murray,\" Mollie Booth called breathlessly. \"Will you  please come here just a minute?\"    Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily. He did not want to  talk with Mollie Booth just then. Confound it, what did the girl want?  Why was she looking so mysterious?    Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine  hiding place and handed it over the paling.    \"She give me this at the station--Miss Mannering did,\" she gasped,  \"and asked me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#6)"],[1," foolishly. Of course you are going to answer  his letter. You are as good as engaged to him. Wasn't that practically  understood when he left?\"    \"No, no, dear,\" and Anna shook her sleek black head with the air of  explaining matters to an obtuse child. \"_I_ was the only one who  understood. Gil _mis_understood. He thought that I would really wait  for him until he should have made enough money to come home and pay  off the mortgage. I let him think so, because I hated to hurt his  little feelings. But now it's off with the old love and on with a new  one for me.\"    \"Anna, you cannot be in earnest!\" exclaimed Alma.    But she was afraid that Anna was in earnest. Anna had a wretched  habit of being in earnest when she said flippant things.    \"You don't mean that you are not going to write to Gilbert at  all--after all you promised?\"    Anna placed her elbows daintily on the top of the rocking chair,  dropped her pointed chin in her hands, and looked at Alma with black  demure eyes.    \"I--do--mean--just--that,\" she said slowly. \"I never mean to marry  Gilbert Murray. This is final, Alma, and you need not scold or coax,  because it would be a waste of breath. Gilbert is safely out of the  way, and now I am going to have a good time with a few other  delightful men creatures in Exeter.\"    Anna nodded decisively, flashed a smile at Alma, picked up her cat,  and went out. At the door she turned and looked back, with the big  black cat snuggled under her chin.    \"If you think Gilbert will feel very badly over his letter not being  answered, you might answer it yourself, Alma,\" she said teasingly.  \"There it is\"--she took the letter from the pocket of her ruffled  apron and threw it on a chair. \"You may read it if you want to; it  isn't really a love letter. I told Gilbert he wasn't to write silly  letters. Come, pussy, I'm going to get ready for prayer meeting. We've  got a nice, new, young, good-looking minister in Exeter, pussy, and  that makes prayer meeting _very_ interesting.\"    Anna shut the door, her departing laugh rippling mockingly through the  dusk. Alma picked up Gilbert Murray's letter and went to her room. She  wanted to cry, since she could not shake Anna. Even if she could have  shook her, it would only have made her more perverse. Anna was in  earnest; Alma knew that, even while she hoped and believed that it was  but the earnestness of a freak that would pass in time. Anna had had  one like it a year ago, when she had cast Gilbert off for three  months, driving him distracted by flirting with Charlie Moore. Then  she had suddenly repented and taken him back. Alma thought that this  whim would run its course likewise and leave a repentant Anna. But  meanwhile everything might be spoiled. Gilbert might not prove  forgiving a second time.    Alma would have given much if she could only have induced Anna to  answer Gilbert's letter, but coaxing Anna to do anything was a very  sure and effective way of preventing her from doing it.           *       *       *       *       *    Alma and Anna had lived alone at the old Williams homestead ever since  their mother's death four years before. Exeter matrons thought this  hardly proper, since Alma, in spite of her grave ways, was only  twenty-four. The farm was rented, so that Alma's only responsibilities  were the post office which she kept, and that harum-scarum beauty of  an Anna.    The Murray homestead adjoined theirs. Gilbert Murray had grown up with  Alma; they had been friends ever since she could remember. Alma loved  Gilbert with a love which she herself believed to be purely sisterly,  and which nobody else doubted could be, since she had been at pains to  make a match--Exeter matrons' phrasing--between Gil and Anna, and was  manifestly delighted when Gilbert obligingly fell in love with the  latter.    There was a small mortgage on the Murray place which Mr. Murray senior  had not been able to pay off. Gilbert determined to get rid of it, and  his thoughts turned to the west. His father was an active, hale old  man, quite capable of managing the farm in Gilbert's absence.  Alexander MacNair had gone to the west two years previously and got  work on a new railroad. He wrote to Gilbert to come too, promising him  plenty of work and good pay. Gilbert went, but before going he had  asked Anna to marry him.    It was the first proposal Anna had ever had, and she managed it quite  cleverly, from her standpoint. She told Gilbert that he must wait  until he came home again before settling that, meanwhile, they would  be _very_ good friends--emphasized with a blush--and that he might  write to her. She kissed him goodbye, and Gilbert, honest fellow, was  quite satisfied. When an Exeter girl had allowed so much to be  inferred, it was understood to be equivalent to an engagement. Gilbert  had never discerned that Anna was not like the other Exeter girls, but  was a law unto herself.    Alma sat down by her window and looked out over the lane where the  slim wild cherry trees were bronzing under the autumn frosts. Her lips  were very firmly set. Something must be done. But what?    Alma's heart was set on this marriage for two reasons. Firstly, if  Anna married Gilbert she would be near her all her life. She could not  bear the thought that some day Anna might leave her and go far away to  live. In the second and largest place, she desired the marriage  because Gilbert did. She had always been desirous, even in the old,  childish play-days, that Gilbert should get just exactly what he  wanted. She had always taken a keen, strange delight in furthering his  wishes.    Anna's falseness would surely break his heart, and Alma winced at the  thought of his pain.    There was one thing she could do. Anna's tormenting suggestion had  fallen on fertile soil. Alma balanced pros and cons, admitting the  risk. But she would have taken a tenfold larger risk in the hope of  holding secure Anna's place in Gilbert's affections until Anna herself  should come to her senses.    When it grew quite dark and Anna had gone lilting down the lane on her  way to prayer meeting, Alma lighted her lamp, read Gilbert's  letter--and answered it. Her handwriting was much like Anna's. She  signed the letter \"A. Williams,\" and there was nothing in it that  might not have been written by her to Gilbert; but she knew that  Gilbert would believe Anna had written it, and she intended him so to  believe. Alma never did a thing halfway when she did it at all. At  first she wrote rather constrainedly but, reflecting that in any case  Anna would have written a merely friendly letter, she allowed her  thoughts to run freely, and the resulting epistle was an excellent one  of its kind. Alma had the gift of expression and more brains than  Exeter people had ever imagined she possessed. When Gilbert read that  letter a fortnight later he was surprised to find that Anna was so  clever. He had always, with a secret regret, thought her much inferior  to Alma in this respect, but that delightful letter, witty, wise,  fanciful, was the letter of a clever woman.    When a year had passed Alma was still writing to Gilbert the letters  signed \"A. Williams.\" She had ceased to fear being found out, and she  took a strange pleasure in the correspondence for its own sake. At  first she had been quakingly afraid of discovery. When she smuggled  the letters addressed in Gilbert's handwriting to Miss Anna Williams  out of the letter packet and hid them from Anna's eyes, she felt as  guilty as if she were breaking all the laws of the land at once. To be  sure, she knew that she would have to confess to Anna some day, when  the latter repented and began to wish she had written to Gilbert, but  that was a very different thing from premature disclosure.    But Anna had as yet given no sign of such repentance, although Alma  looked for it anxiously. Anna was having the time of her life. She was  the acknowledged beauty of five settlements, and she went forward on  her career of conquest quite undisturbed by the jealousies and  heart-burnings she provoked on every side.    One moonlight night she went for a sleigh-drive with Charlie Moore of  East Exeter--and returned to tell Alma that they were married!    \"I knew you would make a fuss, Alma, because you don't like Charlie,  so we just took matters into our own hands. It was so much more  romantic, too. I'd always said I'd never be married in any of your  dull, commonplace ways. You might as well forgive me and be nice right  off, Alma, because you'd have to do it anyway, in time. Well, you do  look surprised!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Alma accepted the situation with an apathy that amazed Anna. The truth  was that Alma was stunned by a thought that had come to her even while  Anna was speaking.    \"Gilbert will find out about the letters now, and despise me.\"    Nothing else, not even the fact that Anna had married shiftless  Charlie Moore, seemed worth while considering beside this. The fear  and shame of it haunted her like a nightmare; she shrank every morning  from the thought of all the mail that was coming that day, fearing  that there would be an angry, puzzled letter from Gilbert. He must  certainly soon hear of Anna's marriage; he would see it in the home  paper, other correspondents in Exeter would write him of it. Alma grew  sick at heart thinking of the complications in front of her.    When Gilbert's letter came she left it for a whole day before she  could summon courage to open it. But it was a harmless epistle after  all; he had not yet heard of Anna's marriage. Alma had at first no  thought of answering it, yet her fingers ached to do so. Now that Anna  was gone, her loneliness was unbearable. She realized how much  Gilbert's letters had meant to her, even when written to another  woman. She could bear her life well enough, she thought, if she only  had his letters to look forward to.    No more letters came from Gilbert"]]]
