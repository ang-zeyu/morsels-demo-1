In this diarrhoea there is no appearance of curdled chyle in  the stools, as occurs in cholera. I. 3. 1. 5.    The _diarrhoea crapulosa_, or diarrhoea from indigestion, occurs when too  great a quantity of food or liquid has been taken; which not being  compleatly digested, stimulates the intestines like any other extraneous  acrid material; and thus produces an increase of the secretions into them  of mucus, pancreatic juice, and bile. When the contents of the bowels are  still more stimulant, as when drastic purges, or very putrescent diet, have  been taken, a cholera is induced. See Sect. XXIX. 4.    The _diarrhoea infantum_, or diarrhoea of infants, is generally owing to  too great acidity in their bowels. Milk is found curdled in the stomachs of  all animals, old as well as young, and even of carnivorous ones, as of  hawks. (Spallanzani.) And it is the gastric juice of the calf, which is  employed to curdle milk in the process of making cheese. Milk is the  natural food for children, and must curdle in their stomachs previous to  digestion; and as this curdling of the milk destroys a part of the acid  juices of the stomach, there is no reason for discontinuing the use of it,  though it is occasionally ejected in a curdled state. A child of a week  old, which had been taken from the breast of its dying mother, and had by  some uncommon error been suffered to take no food but water-gruel, became  sick and griped in twenty-four hours, and was convulsed on the second day,  and died on the third! When all young quadrupeds, as well as children, have  this natural food of milk prepared for them, the analogy is so strong in  favour of its salubrity, that a person should have powerful testimony  indeed of its disagreeing, before he advises the discontinuance of the use  of it to young children in health, and much more so in sickness. The  farmers lose many of their calves, which are brought up by gruel, or gruel  and old milk; and among the poor children of Derby, who are thus fed,  hundreds are starved into the scrophula, and either perish, or live in a  state of wretched debility.    When young children are brought up without a breast, they should for the  first two months have no food but new milk; since the addition of any kind  of bread or flour is liable to ferment, and produce too much acidity; as  appears by the consequent diarrhoea with green dejections and gripes; the  colour is owing to a mixture of acid with the natural quantity of bile, and  the pain to its stimulus. And they should never be fed as they lie upon  their backs, as in that posture they are necessitated to swallow all that  is put into their mouths; but when they are fed, as they are sitting up, or  raised up, when they have had enough, they can permit the rest to run out  of their mouths. This circumstance is of great importance to the health of  those children, who are reared by the spoon, since if too much food is  given them, indigestion, and gripes, and diarrhoea, is the consequence; and  if too little, they become emaciated; and of this exact quantity their own  palates judge the best.    M. M. In this last case of the diarrhoea of children, the food should be  new milk, which by curdling destroys part of the acid, which coagulates it.  Chalk about four grains every six hours, with one drop of spirit of  hartshorn, and half a drop of laudanum. But a blister about the size of a  shilling is of the greatest service by restoring the power of digestion.  See Article III. 2. 1. in the subsequent Materia Medica.    6. _Salivatio calida._ Warm salivation. Increased secretion of saliva. This  may be effected either by stimulating the mouth of the gland by mercury  taken internally; or by stimulating the excretory duct of the gland by  pyrethrum, or tobacco; or simply by the movement of the muscles, which lie  over the gland, as in masticating any tasteless substance, as a lock of  wool, or mastic.    In about the middle of nervous fevers a great spitting of saliva sometimes  occurs, which has been thought critical; but as it continues sometimes two  or even three weeks without the relief of the patient, it may be concluded  to arise from some accidental circumstance, perhaps not unsimilar to the  hysteric ptyalisms mentioned in Class I. 3. 2. 2. See Sect. XXIV.    M. M. Cool air, diluents, warm bath, evacuations.    7. _Catharrhus calidus._ Warm catarrh. Consists in an increased secretion  of mucus from the nostrils without inflammation. This disease, which is  called a cold in the head, is frequently produced by cold air acting for  some time on the membranes, which line the nostrils, as it passes to the  lungs in respiration. Whence a torpor of the action of the mucous glands is  first introduced, as in I. 2. 3. 3. and an orgasm or increased action  succeeds in consequence. Afterwards this orgasm and torpor are liable to  alternate with each other for some time like the cold and hot fits of ague,  attended with deficient or exuberant secretion of mucus in the nostrils.    At other times it arises from reverse sympathy with some extensive parts of  the skin, which have been exposed too long to cold, as of the head, or  feet. In consequence of the torpor of these cutaneous capillaries those of  the mucous membrane of the nostrils act with greater energy by reverse  sympathy; and thence secrete more mucus from the blood. At the same time  the absorbents, acting also with greater energy by their reverse sympathy  with those of some distant part of the skin, absorb the thinner parts of  the mucus more hastily; whence the mucus is both thicker and in greater  quantity. Other curious circumstances attend this disease; the membrane  becomes at times so thickened by its increased action in secreting the  mucus, that the patient cannot breathe through his nostrils. In this  situation if he warms his whole skin suddenly by fire or bed-clothes, or by  drinking warm tea, the increased action of the membrane ceases by its  reverse sympathy with the skin; or by the retraction of the sensorial power  to other parts of the system; and the patient can breathe again through the  nostrils. The same sometimes occurs for a time on going into the cold air  by the deduction of heat from the mucous membrane, and its consequent  inactivity or torpor. Similar to this when the face and breast have been  very hot and red, previous to the eruption of the small-pox by inoculation,  and that even when exposed to cool air, I have observed the feet have been  cold; till on covering them with warm flannel, as the feet have become  warm, the face has cooled. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. Class II. 1. 3. 5. IV. 2.  2. 10. IV. 1. 1. 5.    M. M. Evacuations, abstinence, oil externally on the nose, warm diluent  fluids, warm shoes, warm night-cap.    8. _Expectoratio calida._ Warm expectoration consists of the increased  secretion of mucus from the membrane, which lines the bronchiae, or  air-cells of the lungs, without inflammation. This increased mucus is  ejected by the action of coughing, and is called a cold, and resembles the  catarrh of the preceding article; with which it is frequently combined.    M. M. Inhale the steam of warm water, evacuations, warm bath, afterwards  opium, sorbentia.    9. _Exsudatio pone aures._ A discharge behind the ears. This chiefly  affects children, and is a morbid secretion; as appears from its fetor; for  if it was owing to defect of absorption, it would be saline, and not fetid;  if a morbid action has continued a considerable time, it should not be  stopped too suddenly; since in that case some other morbid action is liable  to succeed in its stead. Thus children are believed to have had cholics, or  even convulsions, consequent to the too sudden healing of these morbid  effusions behind their ears. The rationale of this is to be explained from  a medical fact, which I have frequently observed; and that is, that a  blister on the back greatly strengthens the power of digestion, and removes  the heart-burn in adults, and green stools in children. The stimulus of the  blister produces sensation in the vessels of the skin; with this additional  sensorial power these vessels act more strongly; and with these the vessels  of the internal membranes of the stomach and bowels act with greater energy  from their direct sympathy with them. Now the acrid discharge behind the  ears of children produces sensation on that part of the skin, and so far  acts as a small blister. When this is suddenly stopped, a debility of the  digestive power of the stomach succeeds from the want of this accustomed  stimulus, with flatulency, green stools, gripes, and sometimes consequent  convulsions. See Class II. 1. 5. 6. and II. 1. 4. 6.    M. M. If the matter be absorbed, and produces swelling of the lymphatics of  the neck, it should be cured as soon as possible by dusting the part with  white lead, cerussa, in very fine powder; and to prevent any ill  consequence an issue should be kept for about a month in the arm; or a  purgative medicine should be taken, every other day for three or four  times, which should consist of a grain of calomel, and three or four grains  of rhubarb, and as much chalk. If there be no appearance of absorption, it  is better only to keep the parts clean by washing them with warm water  morning and evening; or putting fuller's earth on them; especially till the  time of toothing is past. The tinea, or scald head, and a leprous eruption,  which often appears behind the ears, are different diseases.    10. _Gonorrhea calida._ Warm gleet. Increased discharge of mucus from the  urethra or prostrate gland without venereal desire, or venereal infection.  See Class I. 2. 3. 8.    M. M.

Introduction  This category includes one entry, Background.    Irrigated land  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is  artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) and a brief  description of the selection process for members.    Labor force  This entry contains the total labor force figure.    Labor force - by occupation  This entry contains a rank ordering of component parts of the labor  force by occupation.    Land boundaries  This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the  individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries.    Land use  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for five  different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated for crops  that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and rice;  permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted  after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber; permanent pastures  - land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forests and  woodland - land under dense or open stands of trees; other - any land  type not specifically mentioned above, such as urban areas, roads,  desert, etc.    Languages  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting with the  largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking  that language.    Legal system  This entry contains a brief description of the legal system's  historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of International  Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.    Legislative branch  This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral,  bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of  office. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.  Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats  held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth  This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group  of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains  constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as  the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a  measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the  mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the  potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for  the calculation of various actuarial measures.    Literacy  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no  universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise  specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the  ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards  that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write  is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy, while not  a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily  available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of  literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development  of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.    Location  This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring  countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Map references  This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which a  country may be found. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be  helpful in finding some smaller countries.    Maritime claims  This entry includes the following claims: contiguous zone, continental  shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing zone, extended  fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country), other (unique  maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North  Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The proximity of  neighboring states may prevent some national claims from being extended  the full distance.    Merchant marine  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of  goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships),  which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a  grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry  contains information in two subfields - total and ships by type. Total  includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for  those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage  is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc. that a ship  can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross  register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered  volume of the ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it  to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable  relationship between GRT and DWT. Ships by type includes a listing of  barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers,  combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers, container  ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional  large-load carriers, petroleum tankers, passenger ships,  passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships,  roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships, specialized  tankers, and vehicle carriers.          A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a  territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use  of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an  offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register.  Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent  country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime  laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature  of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in  the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may  also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of  convenience register, except that it is not the register of an  independent state.         A flag of convenience register is a national register offering  registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major  flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue  of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal  manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag  state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority  of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an  open register.         A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which  holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or  abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is  crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the  register.         An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset  of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national  flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of  maritime rules from those on the main national register. These  differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign  nationals as crewmembers, and, usually, ownership outside the flag  state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian  International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are  the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been  instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of  convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and  Danish flags.         A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of  freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but  accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.         A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as  listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the  compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a  ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of  the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the  nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.    Military  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military branches  This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other  defense or security forces.    Military expenditures - dollar figure  This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the  figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in  percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an  exchange rate basis not purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. However,  in the case of Russia, estimates of military expenditures have been  made using PPP. Dollar figures for military expenditures should be  treated with caution because of different price patterns and accounting  methods among nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of  their currencies.    Military expenditures - percent of GDP  This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent  of gross domestic product (GDP).    Military manpower - availability  This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and  assumes that every individual is fit to serve.    Military manpower - fit for military service  This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for  military service. This"]]]
