You don't mean it, do you?\"    Unani Assu turned the rat over with a contemptuous toe. \"Yes, I mean it.  Behold Aimu, the man who thought himself creator and destroyer--the man  who said that a human being was no higher than a rat! Perhaps he was  right, for see this thing that was once a man!\"    Hale buried his face in his hands. \"Kill it, Unani Assu! Kill it!\"    Unani Assu's low laugh was metallic. \"You kill it.\"    Hale uncovered his face. \"Open the disintegrator.\" Gingerly he reached  for the rat's tail.    But his hand never touched the animal. The hairless face turned for a  second, and the little, beady eyes blinked up at Hale with an expression  that his fevered imagination thought almost human. Then, like a dark  shadow, the rat dashed away. Once around the room it scampered, hunting  for an exit. Hale started in pursuit. He was almost upon the animal  again, when, leaping up from his grasp, it landed on a low shelf where  chemicals were stored. Several bottles fell, filling the room with  fumes.    Another bottle fell, and, suddenly, amid a thunderous roar, the ceiling  and walls began falling. Some highly explosive chemical had been stored  in one of the bottles.    Hale was thrown violently against the couch. His hand touched Ana's  body. One last shred of consciousness enabled him to pick her up and  drag her out. In the open, he fell, aware, before blackness descended,  that flames leaped high over the laboratory building and that Unani Assu  lay dead within.           *       *       *       *       *    Hale and Ana, leaning over the deck-rail of a small steam launch, gazed  into the dark waters of the Amazon.    \"We ought to reach Para by morning,\" said Hale, \"and then, dearest,  we're off for New York!\"    Ana, wearing one of the first civilized dresses she had ever donned, and  looking as smart as any debutante, slipped her little hand into her  husband's.    \"Isn't it a shame, Hale,\" she moaned, \"that the fire burned all the  animals and insects, the machinery, and even your notes?\" Her beautiful  face saddened. \"Just one or two specimens might have been proof enough  for your What-You-Call-It Club!\"    \"The Nescience Club, darling. No, I can't expect to win the Woolman  prize, but I've won a prize worth far more.\" He squeezed her little hand  and looked devotedly into her blue eyes. \"And, Ana, I've reasoned out  something concerning mind-electrons which even Sir Basil overlooked.\"    \"What is it, Hale?\"    \"He maintained that matter seeks always to enslave mind-electrons, but I  am convinced that mind-electrons seek to enslave matter. Understand?  It's creation, Ana! Had Sir Basil succeeded in broadcasting death  throughout the world, the freed mind-electrons, as in the beginning,  would have started again to vitalize inorganic atoms. And, in a few  million years, which is no time to the Mind, the world would be humming  with a new civilization. Large thought, eh, sweetheart?\"          A SIGNAL TO THE MOON    The idea of a radio signal to the moon may sound fantastic, but is  easily within the range of possibility, says Dr. A. Hoyt Taylor, Chief  of the Radio Division of the United States Naval Research Laboratories  at Washington, who plans such an attempt in the near future.    \"We have reason to expect a good chance of getting the signal back in a  time interval of slightly less than three seconds,\" said Dr. Taylor.    To be exact, a radio signal should be reflected back to earth in a time  interval of 2.8 seconds, this being the necessary elapsed time for it to  carry the 250,000 miles to the moon and return at its speed of 300,000  kilometers, or 186,000 miles per second.    The signal would be very weak, Dr. Taylor points out, but not impossible  of detection with the present refinement of receiving instruments,  provided no great absorption took place in interstellar space.    A high frequency wave will be used, as such a wave penetrates readily  the earth's atmosphere and probably goes far beyond. The frequency of  the wave will range between 20,000 and 30,000 kilocycles. Twenty  kilowats of power will be used, enough to furnish current for about  forty flatirons.    The value of a radio signal to the moon lies in the confirmation of  whether there is or not heavy absorption of waves in the upper levels of  our own atmosphere. If successful it would indicate a reasonably good  reflection coefficient at the surface of the moon--the power of the  moon's surface to act as a joint agent in the perfection of the signal.    The signal might have some bearing also on whether the moon has an  atmosphere--something pretty much settled already by astronomical  observation. It would also lead to the possibility of fairly accurate  determination of wave velocity in free space, all of interest to  science, either confirming existing theories or establishing new ones.          The Pirate Planet    PART TWO OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL    _By Charles W. Diffin_      It is war. Interplanetary war. And on far distant Venus two    fighting Earthlings stand up against a whole planet run amuck.      WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE    A flash of light on Venus!--and at Maricopa Flying Field Lieutenant  McGuire and Captain Blake laugh at its possible meaning until the  radio's weird call and the sight of a giant ship in the night sky prove  their wildest thoughts are facts. \"Big as an ocean liner,\" it hangs in  midair, then turns and shoots upward at incredible speed until it  disappears entirely, in space!    McGuire goes to Mount Lawson observatory, and there he sees the flash on  Venus repeated. Professor Sykes, who had observed the first flash,  confirms it and sees still more. He sees the enveloping clouds of Venus  torn asunder, and beneath them an identifying mark, a continent shaped  like the letter \"L.\"    And then the great ship comes again. It hovers above the observatory and  settles slowly down.    [Illustration: \"Hold them off as long as you can!\"]    Back at Maricopa Field, Captain Blake has tested a new plane for  altitude, and is now prepared to interview the stranger in the higher  levels. McGuire's frantic phone call sends him out into the night with  the 91st Squadron of planes in support. It is their last flight, for all  but Blake. The invader smothers them in a great sphere of gas, but  Blake, with his oxygen flasks, flies through to crash beside the  observatory. Only Blake survives to see the enemy land, while strange  man-shapes loot the buildings and carry off McGuire and Sykes.    A bombardment with giant shells dispels the last doubt of the earth  being under attack. The flashes from Venus at regular intervals spout  death and destruction upon the earth; a mammoth gun, sunk into the  planet itself, bears once upon the earth at every revolution, until the  changing position of the globes take the target out of range.    In less than a year and a half the planets must meet again. It is war to  the death; a united world against an enemy unknown--an enemy who has  conquered space. And there is less than a year and a half in which to  prepare!    Far out in the blackness of space McGuire and Sykes are captives in the  giant ship. Their stupor leaves them; they find themselves immersed in  clouds. The clouds part; their ship drops through; and below them is a  strange continent shaped like the letter \"L.\" Captives of inhuman but  man-shaped things, they are landing upon a strange globe--upon the  planet Venus itself!      CHAPTER VIII    Miles underneath the great ship, from which Lieutenant McGuire and  Professor Sykes were now watching through a floor-window of thick glass,  was a glittering expanse of water--a great ocean. The flickering gold  expanse that reflected back the color of the sunlit clouds passed to one  side as the ship took its station above the island, a continent in size,  that had shown by its shape like a sharply formed \"L\" an identifying  mark to the astronomer.    They were high in the air; the thick clouds that surrounded this new  world were miles from its surface, and the things of the world that  awaited were tiny and blurred.    Airships passed and repassed far below. Large, some of them--as bulky  as the transport they were on; others were small flashing cylinders, but  all went swiftly on their way.    It must have come--some ethereal vibration to warn others from the  path--for layer after layer of craft were cleared for the descent. A  brilliant light flashed into view, a dazzling pin-point on the shore  below, and the great ship fell suddenly beneath them. Swiftly it dropped  down the pathway of light; on even keel it fell down and still down,  till McGuire, despite his experience in the air, was sick and giddy.    The light blinked out at their approach. It was some minutes before the  watching eyes recovered from the brilliance to see what mysteries might  await, and then the surface was close and the range of vision small.    A vast open space--a great court paved with blocks of black and white--a  landing field, perhaps, for about it in regular spacing other huge  cylinders were moored. Directly beneath in a clear space was a giant  cradle of curved arms; it was a mammoth structure, and the men knew at a  glance that this was the bed where their great ship would lie.           *       *       *       *       *    The smooth pavement seemed slowly rising to meet them as their ship  settled close. Now the cradle was below, its arms curved and waiting.  The ship entered their grasp, and the arms widened, then closed to draw  the monster to its rest. Their motion ceased. They were finally, beyond  the last faint doubt, at anchor on a distant world.    A shrill cackle of sound recalled them from the thrill of this  adventure, and the attenuated and lanky figure, with its ashen,  blotchy face that glared at them from the doorway, reminded them that  this excursion into space was none of their desire. They were  prisoners--captives from a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#6)"],[1,"a whip, under the impression that the aggregate  monstrosity is his mother. A ewe never knows her own lamb by sight, and  apparently has no sense of colour. She can recognise its voice half a  mile off among a thousand other voices apparently exactly similar; but  when she gets within five yards of it she starts to smell all the other  lambs within reach, including the black ones--though her own may be  white.    The fiendish resemblance which one sheep bears to another is a great  advantage to them in their struggles with their owners. It makes it more  difficult to draft them out of a strange flock, and much harder to tell  when any are missing.    Concerning this resemblance between sheep, there is a story told of  a fat old Murrumbidgee squatter who gave a big price for a famous ram  called Sir Oliver. He took a friend out one day to inspect Sir Oliver,  and overhauled that animal with a most impressive air of sheep-wisdom.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"at the fineness of the wool. See the serrations  in each thread of it. See the density of it. Look at the way his legs  and belly are clothed--he's wool all over, that sheep. Grand animal,  grand animal!\"    Then they went and had a drink, and the old squatter said, \"Now, I'll  show you the difference between a champion ram and a second-rater.\" So  he caught a ram and pointed out his defects. \"See here--not half the  serrations that other sheep had. No density of fleece to speak of.  Bare-bellied as a pig, compared with Sir Oliver. Not that this isn't  a fair sheep, but he'd be dear at one-tenth Sir Oliver's price. By the  way, Johnson\" (to his overseer), \"what ram _is_ this?\"    \"That, sir,\" replied the astounded functionary--\"that _is_ Sir Oliver,  sir!\"    There is another kind of sheep in Australia, as great a curse in his own  way as the merino--namely, the cross-bred, or half-merino-half-Leicester  animal. The cross-bred will get through, under, or over any fence you  like to put in front of him. He is never satisfied with his owner's run,  but always thinks other people's runs must be better, so he sets off to  explore. He will strike a course, say, south-east, and so long as  the fit takes him he will keep going south-east through all  obstacles--rivers, fences, growing crops, anything. The merino relies on  passive resistance for his success; the cross-bred carries the war into  the enemy's camp, and becomes a living curse to his owner day and night.    Once there was a man who was induced in a weak moment to buy twenty  cross-bred rams. From that hour the hand of Fate was upon him. They  got into all the paddocks they shouldn't have been in. They scattered  themselves over the run promiscuously. They visited the cultivation  paddock and the vegetable-garden at their own sweet will. And then they  took to roving. In a body they visited the neighbouring stations, and  played havoc with the sheep all over the district.    The wretched owner was constantly getting fiery letters from his  neighbours: \"Your blanky rams are here. Come and take them away at  once,\" and he would have to go nine or ten miles to drive them home. Any  man who has tried to drive rams on a hot day knows what purgatory is. He  was threatened every week with actions for trespass.    He tried shutting them up in the sheep-yard. They got out and went back  to the garden. Then he gaoled them in the calf-pen. Out again and into  a growing crop. Then he set a boy to watch them; but the boy went to  sleep, and they were four miles away across country before he got on to  their tracks.    At length, when they happened accidentally to be at home on their  owner's run, there came a big flood. His sheep, mostly merinos, had  plenty of time to get on to high ground and save their lives; but, of  course, they didn't, and were almost all drowned. The owner sat on a  rise above the waste of waters and watched the dead animals go by. He  was a ruined man. But he said, \"Thank God, those cross-bred rams are  drowned, anyhow.\" Just as he spoke there was a splashing in the water,  and the twenty rams solemnly swam ashore and ranged themselves in front  of him. They were the only survivors of his twenty thousand sheep.  He broke down, and was taken to an asylum for insane paupers. The  cross-breds had fulfilled their destiny.    The cross-bred drives his owner out of his mind, but the merino ruins  his man with greater celerity. Nothing on earth will kill cross-breds;  nothing will keep merinos alive. If they are put on dry salt-bush  country they die of drought. If they are put on damp, well-watered  country they die of worms, fluke, and foot-rot. They die in the wet  seasons and they die in the dry ones.    The hard, resentful look on the faces of all bushmen comes from a long  course of dealing with merino sheep. The merino dominates the bush,  and gives to Australian literature its melancholy tinge, its despairing  pathos. The poems about dying boundary-riders, and lonely graves under  mournful she-oaks, are the direct outcome of the poet's too close  association with that soul-destroying animal. A man who could write  anything cheerful after a day in the drafting-yards would be a freak of  nature.          THE BULLOCK      The typical Australian bullock--long-horned, sullen-eyed, stupid, and  vindictive--is bred away out in Queensland, on remote stations in the  Never Never land, where men live on damper and beef, and occasionally  eat a whole bottle of hot pickles at a sitting, simply to satisfy their  craving for vegetable food. Here, under the blazing tropic sun, among  flies and dust and loneliness, they struggle with the bullock from  year's end to year's end. It is not to be supposed that they take up  this kind of thing for fun. The man who worked cattle for sport would  wheel bricks for amusement.    At periodical intervals a boom in cattle-country arises in the cities,  and syndicates are formed to take up country and stock it. It looks so  beautifully simple--_on paper_.    You get your country, thousands of miles of it, for next to nothing.  You buy your breeding herd for a ridiculously small sum, on long-dated  bills. Your staff consists of a manager, who toils for a share of the  profits, a couple of half-civilized white stockmen at low wages, and  a handful of blacks, who work harder for a little opium ash than they  would for much money. Plant costs nothing, improvements nothing--no  woolshed is needed, there are no shearers to pay, and no carriage to  market, for the bullock walks himself down to his doom. Granted that  prices are low, still it is obvious that there must be huge profits in  the business. So the cattle start away out to \"the country\", where they  are supposed to increase and multiply, and enrich their owners. Alas!  for such hopes. There is a curse on cattle.    No one has ever been able to explain exactly how the deficit arises.  Put the figures before the oldest and most experienced cattleman, and he  will fail to show why they don't work out right. And yet they never do.  It is not the fault of the cattle themselves. Sheep would rather die  than live--and when one comes to think of the life they lead, one can  easily understand their preference for death; but cattle, if given half  a chance, will do their best to prolong their existence.    If they are running on low-lying country and are driven off when a flood  comes, they will probably walk back into the flood-water and get drowned  as soon as their owner turns his back. But, as a rule, cattle are not  suicidal. They sort themselves into mobs, they pick out the best bits of  country, they find their way to the water, they breed habitually; but it  always ends in the same way. The hand of Fate is against them.    If a drought comes, they eat off the grass near the water and have to  travel far out for a feed. Then they fall away and get weak, and when  they come down to drink they get bogged in the muddy waterholes and die  there.    Or Providence sends the pleuro, and big strong beasts slink away by  themselves, and stand under trees glaring savagely till death comes.  Or else the tick attacks them, and soon a fine, strong beast becomes  a miserable, shrunken, tottering wreck. Once cattle get really low in  condition they are done for. Sheep can be shifted when their pasture  fails, but you can't shift cattle. They die quicker on the roads than  on the run. The only thing is to watch and pray for rain. It always  comes--after the cattle are dead.    As for describing the animals themselves, it would take volumes. Sheep  are all alike, but cattle are all different. The drovers on the road  get to know the habits and tendencies of each particular bullock--the  one-eyed bullock that pokes out to the side of the mob, the inquisitive  bullock that is always walking over towards the drover as if he were  going to speak to him, the agitator bullock who is always trying to get  up a stampede and prodding the others with his horns.    In poor Boake's \"Where the Dead Men Lie\" he says:         Only the hand of Night can free them--       That's when the dead men fly!       Only the frightened cattle see them--       See the dead men go by!       Cloven hoofs beating out one measure,       Bidding the stockman know no leisure--       That's when the dead men take their pleasure!       That's when the dead men fly!    Cattle on a camp see ghosts, sure enough--else, why is it that, when  hundreds are in camp at night--some standing, some lying asleep, all  facing different ways--in an instant, at some invisible cause of alarm,  the whole mob are on their feet and all racing _in the same direction_,  away from some unseen terror?    It doesn't do to sneak round cattle at night; it is better to whistle  and sing than to surprise them by a noiseless appearance. Anyone  sneaking about frightens them, and then they will charge right over  the top of somebody on the opposite side, and away into the darkness,  becoming more"]]]
