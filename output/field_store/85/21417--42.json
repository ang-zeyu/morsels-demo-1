This tail must be long enough so that it can be  conveniently held in the left hand, as described on page 13, and rotated  about the same axis as the main tube. Holding the main tube in the right  hand and the tail in the left, the tube is rotated in a large flame so  that a piece of it, beginning where the tail stops and extending about  an inch to the right, may be uniformly heated to the highest temperature  at which it can be kept in shape. As soon as this temperature is  reached, the tube is removed from the flame, continuing the rotation and  taking care not to draw out the heated part, and gently blown. The  rotation is carefully continued during the blowing, holding the tube in  approximately a horizontal position. As soon as the tube has expanded a  little the tail is pushed gently toward the main tube, continuing the  gentle blowing. If this is properly done, the heated piece of tube will  become a short bulb of about double its original diameter, and about the  same wall thickness as the original tube. It will have somewhat the  appearance of _a_, Fig. 10, when properly manipulated.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Blowing a bulb on the end of a tube.]    The tube is now reheated as before, taking care this time that the  heating extends over all that part of the bulb to the right of the  dotted line in the figure, as well as part of the main tube adjoining.  If this heating has been properly placed, when the operation of blowing  and pushing together is repeated the result will be to lengthen the bulb  into a uniform cylinder, as shown in _b_, Fig. 10. Otherwise the result  will be a series of bulbs, as in _c_, Fig. 10, separated by thickened  ridges which will be almost impossible of removal later and will  disfigure the final bulb. This operation of heating, blowing and pushing  together is repeated several times, until the cylinder becomes as long  as can be conveniently handled (about 1-1/4 inches to 1-1/2 inches). If  more glass is needed than is then contained in the cylinder, the latter  may now be heated as a whole, and blown and pushed gently into a shorter  cylinder of a slightly greater diameter, and more glass then added as  before.    When enough glass has been collected for the bulb, it is all well heated  and blown gently a couple of times, pushing the mass together as  required, until a thick bulb like _d_, Fig. 10, is obtained. The tail  must now be removed at the point indicated by the dotted line. To do  this, a very fine flame is directed on the point where the tail joins  the bulb, and the tube well rotated as the glass softens at that point.  When sufficiently soft, the work is raised a little, so that the flame  instead of striking the glass squarely at the point indicated passes  below and tangential to it. The tail is now drawn off slowly, continuing  the rotation, raising the work just out of the flame whenever the thread  of glass drawn off becomes too thin, and lowering it again to the point  where the flame just touches it when the glass stiffens a little. By  this means the tail may be drawn off without leaving an appreciable lump  behind, as indicated in _e_ and _f_, Fig. 10. When as much of the extra  glass has been removed as is practicable, the flame is brought to play  squarely upon the little lump left, the last of the tail removed, and  the lump heated and gently blown to a small excrescence on the main  bulb. The whole end of the latter is now heated until it begins to  shrink a little, and gently blown to make it uniform in thickness. The  whole bulb is then heated in a flame of the proper size, so that it all  may shrink to about two-thirds of its diameter. The flame must be very  carefully chosen and directed, so as to shrink all the bulb, right up to  the main tube, but not soften the latter. As soon as this stage is  reached, the bulb is removed from the flame, continuing the even  rotation, and blown to the desired size, preferably by a series of  gentle puffs following one another at very short intervals. During the  blowing, the main tube is held in a horizontal position, and any  tendency of the bulb to fall out of line is corrected by the rotation.  If the shape of the bulb or its size are not satisfactory, it may be  shrunk again and reblown. Such shrinking should begin in a large yellow  flame, with just enough air to give it direction. The amount of air may  be gradually increased as the bulb shrinks and the walls become thick  enough to bear it without collapsing. If the bulb starts to collapse at  any time, it must be immediately blown enough to regain its convex  surface, before the shrinking proceeds further.    =Discussion.=--In collecting the glass for the bulb, enough must be  gathered to give the walls the desired strength. Since the area of a  sphere is proportional to the cube of its diameter, it is evident that  doubling the size of a bulb diminishes the thickness of its walls to a  very large extent. The limit of diameter for a strong bulb on ordinary  1/4-inch tubing, collecting the glass as above, is about 1-1/2 inches,  and the beginner will do well not to blow his bulbs more than an inch in  diameter.    The collection of the glass is one of the most important parts of the  process. If the mass of glass be twisted, furrowed or ridged, or  lop-sided, it is very difficult to get a good, even, spherical bulb, no  matter how many times it is shrunk and blown. The greatest care should  therefore be taken to get a uniform cylinder, on the same axis as the  main tube; and to this end the rotation of the tube must be carried on  very evenly. For method of holding the tube, see page 14.    If a very large bulb is required, it will often be economical to seal on  the end of the tube a short piece of a large tube, provided with the  proper tail, and use the glass in the large tube for the bulb instead of  attempting to collect it from the small tube. In this case part of the  small tube will usually be included in the bulb, so that the joint comes  in the latter, and not where it joins the tube. As the amount of glass  carried on the end of the tube increases in weight and size the  difficulties of heating it uniformly, keeping it in the proper position  and handling it increase rapidly.    In collecting glass, it is usually best not to leave the part of the  cylinder next the tube with too thick walls. This is always the coolest  part during the preparation for blowing the bulb, consequently it does  not get blown out, and causes an ugly thickened appearance on that end  of the bulb.    If the bulb grows too long or pear-shaped, it may be easily shortened by  heating to the blowing temperature, and then blowing gently with the  main tube in a vertical position, and the bulb at the top of it. Gravity  will then shorten the bulb nicely.    The finished bulb should be a nearly perfect sphere, with the axis of  the tube passing through its center, and the portion of the tube  adjoining the bulb must not be distorted, twisted, or blown out. In  order to prevent the distortion of the tube, care must be taken that it  is never heated quite to its softening point during the process.      EXERCISE NO. 7    BLOWING A BULB IN A TUBE    The tube is selected and one end closed as in the previous exercise, but  it should be cut a little longer, say about twelve inches. Beginning at  a point about four inches from the closed end, glass is collected and  blown into a thick-walled bulb, exactly as in the previous exercise.  Greater care must be taken, however, that the cylinder collected and  this thick bulb are of uniform thickness and set squarely in the axis of  the tube. Instead of removing the tail, the bulb must be blown in this  case with both pieces of tubing attached, and care must be taken that  they \"line up\" properly, _i.e._, are in the same straight line, and that  this line passes as near as may be through the center of the bulb. The  tube is held in approximately horizontal position during the blowing of  the bulb, as in the previous case, and especial care taken with the  rotation. Both pieces of tube must of course be rotated at the same  rate, and their softened ends must be kept at exactly the proper  distance from each other, so that the bulb may be spherical and not  elongated. If the blowing of the bulb be quickly and accurately done, it  may usually be completed before the glass is quite set, and the  alignment of the two tubes may then be rectified while looking straight  through the bore of the tube.    =Discussion.=--The two points of greatest importance are the collection  of the glass, and the uniform rotation of the tube. A larger tube may be  sealed in the middle of a small one when a large amount of glass is  necessary. The piece of tubing used for the exercise must be long enough  so that the fingers may be kept on a cool part of the glass without  getting uncomfortably near the ends of the tube. It should not be any  longer than necessary, however, as the extra weight and length make the  manipulation of the hot glass more difficult.    When a string of bulbs are required on the same tube, a piece of glass  18 inches long may be used at the start, and the first bulb made near  the closed end, as described. Each succeeding bulb will then be in plain  view during the blowing, and when the open end becomes too short for  comfort, it may be dried out, cut off, and another piece joined to it,  starting as in the first method (Exercise No. 1), but instead of drawing  out the thick bulb to a tube, it is made part of the glass collected for  the next bulb. If the string of bulbs becomes awkward to handle on  account of its length and weight, it may be made in several parts and  these later sealed together by the second method, preferably blowing  through a rubber tube attached to the open end, as described on page 22.    Very neat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#6)"],[1,"looks     like this:         Then delete a line from the file by typing \"dd\".       Standard usage would make this         Then delete a line from the file by typing \"dd.\"       but that would be very bad -- because the reader would be prone to     type the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in vi(1) dot repeats the     last command accepted. The net result would be to delete two lines!       The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout.       Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great     Britain, though the older style (which became established for     typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and     quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there. \"Hart's Rules\" and     the \"Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors\" call the hacker-like     style `new' or `logical' quoting. This returns British English to the     style Latin languages (including Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan)     have been using all along.       Another hacker habit is a tendency to distinguish between `scare'     quotes and `speech' quotes; that is, to use British-style single     quotes for marking and reserve American-style double quotes for actual     reports of speech or text included from elsewhere. Interestingly, some     authorities describe this as correct general usage, but mainstream     American English has gone to using double-quotes indiscriminately     enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this     was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with Usenet --ESR]. One     further permutation that is definitely not standard is a hackish     tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes (single quotes) in     pairs; that is, 'like this'. This is modelled on string and character     literal syntax in some programming languages (reinforced by the fact     that many character-only terminals display the apostrophe in     typewriter style, as a vertical single quote).       One quirk that shows up frequently in the [120]email style of Unix     hackers in particular is a tendency for some things that are normally     all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C     routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the     beginning of sentences. It is clear that, for many hackers, the case     of such identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation     (the `spelling') and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an     appropriate reflex because Unix and C both distinguish cases and     confusing them can lead to [121]lossage). A way of escaping this     dilemma is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning     of sentences.       There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to     the effect that precision of expression is more important than     conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or     lose information they can be discarded without a second thought. It is     notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example, in     vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even     when constructed to appear slangy and loose. In fact, to a hacker, the     contrast between `loose' form and `tight' content in jargon is a     substantial part of its humor!       Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis     conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and     these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when     normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available.       One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and     this becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that a person who     goes to caps-lock while in [122]talk mode may be asked to \"stop     shouting, please, you're hurting my ears!\".       Also, it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to     signify emphasis. The asterisk is most common, as in \"What the     *hell*?\" even though this interferes with the common use of the     asterisk suffix as a footnote mark. The underscore is also common,     suggesting underlining (this is particularly common with book titles;     for example, \"It is often alleged that Joe Haldeman wrote     _The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to Robert Heinlein's earlier novel of     the future military, _Starship_Troopers_.\"). Other forms exemplified     by \"=hell=\", \"\\hell/\", or \"/hell/\" are occasionally seen (it's claimed     that in the last example the first slash pushes the letters over to     the right to make them italic, and the second keeps them from falling     over). On FidoNet, you might see #bright# and ^dark^ text, which was     actually interpreted by some reader software. Finally, words may also     be emphasized L I K E T H I S, or by a series of carets (^) under them     on the next line of the text.       There is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this* (which     emphasizes the phrase as a whole), and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which     suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a     very young child or a mentally impaired person). Bracketing a word     with the `*' character may also indicate that the writer wishes     readers to consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is     being made. Examples: *bang*, *hic*, *ring*, *grin*, *kick*, *stomp*,     *mumble*.       One might also see the above sound effects as <bang>, <hic>, <ring>,     <grin>, <kick>, <stomp>, <mumble>. This use of angle brackets to mark     their contents originally derives from conventions used in [123]BNF,     but since about 1993 it has been reinforced by the HTML markup used on     the World Wide Web.       Angle-bracket enclosure is also used to indicate that a term stands     for some [124]random member of a larger class (this is straight from     [125]BNF). Examples like the following are common:  So this <ethnic> walks into a bar one day...       There is also an accepted convention for `writing under erasure'; the     text  Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman,  he's visiting from corporate HQ.       reads roughly as \"Be nice to this fool, er, gentleman...\", with irony     emphasized. The digraph ^H is often used as a print representation for     a backspace, and was actually very visible on old-style printing     terminals. As the text was being composed the characters would be     echoed and printed immediately, and when a correction was made the     backspace keystrokes would be echoed with the string '^H'. Of course,     the final composed text would have no trace of the backspace     characters (or the original erroneous text).       This convention parallels (and may have been influenced by) the ironic     use of `slashouts' in science-fiction fanzines.       A related habit uses editor commands to signify corrections to     previous text. This custom faded in email as more mailers got good     editing capabilities, only to tale on new life on IRCs and other     line-based chat systems.  I've seen that term used on alt.foobar often.  Send it to Erik for the File.  Oops...s/Erik/Eric/.       The s/Erik/Eric/ says \"change Erik to Eric in the preceding\". This     syntax is borrowed from the Unix editing tools ed and sed, but is     widely recognized by non-Unix hackers as well.       In a formula, * signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a row     are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN). Thus,     one might write 2 ** 8 = 256.       Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the     caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead 2^8 = 256. This goes     all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII `up-arrow'     that later became the caret; this was picked up by Kemeny and Kurtz's     original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the bc(1) and     dc(1) Unix tools, which have probably done most to reinforce the     convention on Usenet. (TeX math mode also uses ^ for exponention.) The     notation is mildly confusing to C programmers, because ^ means bitwise     exclusive-or in C. Despite this, it was favored 3:1 over ** in a     late-1990 snapshot of Usenet. It is used consistently in this lexicon.       In on-line exchanges, hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper     fractions (`3.5' or `7/2') rather than `typewriter style' mixed     fractions (`3-1/2'). The major motive here is probably that the former     are more readable in a monospaced font, together with a desire to     avoid the risk that the latter might be read as `three minus     one-half'. The decimal form is definitely preferred for fractions with     a terminating decimal representation; there may be some cultural     influence here from the high status of scientific notation.       Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very     small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN). This     is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for     example, one year is about 3e7 seconds long.       The tilde (~) is commonly used in a quantifying sense of     `approximately'; that is, ~50 means `about fifty'.       On Usenet and in the [126]MUD world, common C boolean, logical, and     relational operators such as |, &, ||, &&, !, ==, !=, >, <, >=, and =<     are often combined with English. The Pascal not-equals, <>, is also     recognized, and occasionally one sees /= for not-equals (from Ada,     Common Lisp, and Fortran 90). The use of prefix `!' as a loose synonym     for `not-' or `no-' is particularly common; thus, `!clue' is read     `no-clue' or `clueless'.       A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming languages     to express ideas in a natural-language text. For example, one might     see the following:  In <jrh578689@thudpucker.com> J.
