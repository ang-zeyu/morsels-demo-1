[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30103"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#6)"],[1,"  It isn't very often that we can find such a pretty place for a nest as  we have here. Most of the time we build our nest under the grass and  cover it over, and build a little tunnel leading to it. This year we  made up our minds not to be afraid.    The people living in the houses over there do not bother us at all and  we are so happy.    You never saw baby larks, did you? Well, they are queer little fellows,  with hardly any feathers on them.    Last summer we had five little birdies to feed, and it kept us busy from  morning till night. This year we only expect three, and Mr. Lark says he  will do all the work. He knows a field that is being plowed, where he  can get nice, large worms.    Hark! that is he singing. He will be surprised when he comes back and  finds me off the nest. He is so afraid that I will let the eggs get  cold, but I won't. There he comes, now.          THE LONG-EARED OWL.      The name of the Long-Eared Owl is derived from the great length of his  \"ears\" or feather-tufts, which are placed upon the head, and erect  themselves whenever the bird is interested or excited. It is the \"black  sheep\" of the owl family, the majority of owls being genuine friends of  the agriculturist, catching for his larder so many of the small animals  that prey upon his crops. In America he is called the Great Horned  Owl--in Europe the Golden Owl.    Nesting time with the owl begins in February, and continues through  March and April. The clown-like antics of both sexes of this bird while  under the tender influence of the nesting season tend somewhat to impair  their reputation for dignity and wise demeanor. They usually have a  simple nest in a hollow tree, but which seems seldom to be built by the  bird itself, as it prefers to take the deserted nest of some other bird,  and to fit up the premises for its own use. They repair slightly from  year to year the same nest. The eggs are white, and generally four or  five in number. While the young are still in the nest, the parent birds  display a singular diligence in collecting food for them.    If you should happen to know of an owl's nest, stand near it some  evening when the old birds are rearing their young. Keep quiet and  motionless, and notice how frequently the old birds feed them. Every ten  minutes or so the soft flap, flap of their wings will be heard, the male  and female alternately, and you will obtain a brief glimpse of them  through the gloom as they enter the nesting place. They remain inside  but a short time, sharing the food equally amongst their brood, and  then are off again to hunt for more. All night, were you to have the  inclination to observe them, you would find they pass to and fro with  food, only ceasing their labors at dawn. The young, as soon as they  reach maturity, are abandoned by their parents; they quit the nest and  seek out haunts elsewhere, while the old birds rear another, and not  infrequently two more broods, during the remainder of the season.    The habits of the Long-Eared Owl are nocturnal. He is seldom seen in the  light of day, and is greatly disturbed if he chance to issue from his  concealment while the sun is above the horizon. The facial disk is very  conspicuous in this species. It is said that the use of this circle is  to collect the rays of light, and throw them upon the eye. The flight  of the owl is softened by means of especially shaped, recurved  feather-tips, so that he may noiselessly steal upon his prey, and  the ear is also so shaped as to gather sounds from below.    The Long-Eared Owl is hardly tameable. The writer of this paragraph, when  a boy, was the possessor, for more than a year, of a very fine specimen.  We called him Judge. He was a monster, and of perfect plumage. Although  he seemed to have some attachment to the children of the family who fed  him, he would not permit himself to be handled by them or by any one in  the slightest. Most of his time he spent in his cage, an immense affair,  in which he was very comfortable. Occasionally he had a day in the barn  with the rats and mice.    The owl is of great usefulness to gardener, agriculturist, and landowner  alike, for there is not another bird of prey which is so great a  destroyer of the enemies of vegetation.          [Illustration: GREAT HORNED OWL.]    THE OWL.                    We know not alway                Who are kings by day,      But the king of the night is the bold brown owl!    I wonder why the folks put my picture last in the book. It can't be  because they don't like me, for I'm sure I never bother them. I don't  eat the farmer's corn like the crow, and no one ever saw me quarrel with  other birds.    Maybe it is because I can't sing. Well, there are lots of good people  that can't sing, and so there are lots of good birds that can't sing.    Did you ever see any other bird sit up as straight as I do? I couldn't  sit up so straight if I hadn't such long, sharp claws to hold on with.    My home is in the woods. Here we owls build our nests--most always in  hollow trees.    During the day I stay in the nest or sit on a limb. I don't like day  time for the light hurts my eyes, but when it begins to grow dark then  I like to stir around. All night long I am wide awake and fly about  getting food for my little hungry ones. They sleep most of the day and  it keeps me busy nearly all night to find them enough to eat.    I just finished my night's work when the man came to take my picture. It  was getting light and I told him to go to a large stump on the edge of  the woods and I would sit for my picture. So here I am. Don't you think  I look wise? How do you like my large eyes? If I could smile at you I  would, but my face always looks sober. I have a great many cousins and  if you really like my picture, I'll have some of them talk to you next  month. I don't think any of them have such pretty feathers though. Just  see if they have when they come.    Well, I must fly back to my perch in the old elm tree. Good-bye.          THE OWL.          In the hollow tree, in the old gray tower,        The spectral owl doth dwell;      Dull, hated, despised in the sunshine hour,        But at dusk he's abroad and well!      Not a bird of the forest e'er mates with him;        All mock him outright by day;      But at night, when the woods grow still and dim,        The boldest will shrink away!              O! when the night falls, and roosts the fowl,            Then, then, is the reign of the Horned Owl!        And the owl hath a bride, who is fond and bold,        And loveth the wood's deep gloom;      And, with eyes like the shine of the moonstone cold,        She awaiteth her ghastly groom.      Not a feather she moves, not a carol she sings,        As she waits in her tree so still,      But when her heart heareth his flapping wings,        She hoots out her welcome shrill!              O! when the moon shines, and dogs do howl,            Then, then, is the joy of the Horned Owl!        Mourn not for the owl, nor his gloomy plight!        The owl hath his share of good--      If a prisoner he be in the broad daylight,        He is lord in the dark greenwood!      Nor lonely the bird, nor his ghastly mate,        They are each unto each a pride;      Thrice fonder, perhaps, since a strange, dark fate        Hath rent them from all beside!              So, when the night falls, and dogs do howl,            Sing, Ho! for the reign of the Horned Owl!                We know not alway                Who are kings by day,      But the King of the Night is the bold Brown Owl!                         BRYAN W.

EPOPS From whom will they take them?    PISTHETAERUS From whom? Why, from themselves. Don't you know the cawing  crow lives five times as long as a man?    EUELPIDES Ah! ah! these are far better kings for us than Zeus!    PISTHETAERUS Far better, are they not? And firstly, we shall not have to  build them temples of hewn stone, closed with gates of gold; they will  dwell amongst the bushes and in the thickets of green oak; the most  venerated of birds will have no other temple than the foliage of the  olive tree; we shall not go to Delphi or to Ammon to sacrifice;(1) but  standing erect in the midst of arbutus and wild olives and holding forth  our hands filled with wheat and barley, we shall pray them to admit us  to a share of the blessings they enjoy and shall at once obtain them for  a few grains of wheat.      f(1) A celebrated temple to Zeus in an oasis of Libya.    CHORUS Old man, whom I detested, you are now to me the dearest of all;  never shall I, if I can help it, fail to follow your advice. Inspirited  by your words, I threaten my rivals the gods, and I swear that if you  march in alliance with me against the gods and are faithful to our just,  loyal and sacred bond, we shall soon have shattered their sceptre. 'Tis  our part to undertake the toil, 'tis yours to advise.    EPOPS By Zeus! 'tis no longer the time to delay and loiter like  Nicias;(1) let us act as promptly as possible.... In the first place,  come, enter my nest built of brushwood and blades of straw, and tell me  your names.      f(1) Nicias was commander, along with Demosthenes, and later on  Alcibiades, of the Athenian forces before Syracuse, in the ill-fated  Sicilian Expedition, 415-413 B.C. He was much blamed for dilatoriness  and indecision.    PISTHETAERUS That is soon done; my name is Pisthetaerus.    EPOPS And his?    PISTHETAERUS Euelpides, of the deme of Thria.    EPOPS Good! and good luck to you.    PISTHETAERUS We accept the omen.    EPOPS Come in here.    PISTHETAERUS Very well, 'tis you who lead us and must introduce us.    EPOPS Come then.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! my god! do come back here. Hi! tell us how we are to  follow you. You can fly, but we cannot.    EPOPS Well, well.    PISTHETAERUS Remember Aesop's fables. It is told there, that the fox  fared very ill, because he had made an alliance with the eagle.    EPOPS Be at ease. You shall eat a certain root and wings will grow on  your shoulders.    PISTHETAERUS Then let us enter. Xanthias and Manes,(1) pick up our  baggage.      f(1) Servants of Pisthetaerus and Euelpides.    CHORUS Hi! Epops! do you hear me?    EPOPS What's the matter?    CHORUS Take them off to dine well and call your mate, the melodious  Procne, whose songs are worthy of the Muses; she will delight our  leisure moments.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! I conjure you, accede to their wish; for this  delightful bird will leave her rushes at the sound of your voice; for  the sake of the gods, let her come here, so that we may contemplate the  nightingale.(1)      f(1) It has already been mentioned that, according to the legend  followed by Aristophanes, Procne had been changed into a nightingale and  Philomela into a swallow.    EPOPS Let it be as you desire. Come forth, Procne, show yourself to  these strangers.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! great Zeus! what a beautiful little bird! what a dainty  form! what brilliant plumage!(1)      f(1) The actor, representing Procne, was dressed out as a courtesan, but  wore a mask of a bird.    EUELPIDES Do you know how dearly I should like to splint her legs for  her?    PISTHETAERUS She is dazzling all over with gold, like a young girl.(1)      f(1) Young unmarried girls wore golden ornaments; the apparel of married  women was much simpler.    EUELPIDES Oh! how I should like to kiss her!    PISTHETAERUS Why, wretched man, she has two little sharp points on her  beak!    EUELPIDES I would treat her like an egg, the shell of which we remove  before eating it; I would take off her mask and then kiss her pretty  face.    EPOPS Let us go in.    PISTHETAERUS Lead the way, and may success attend us.    CHORUS Lovable golden bird, whom I cherish above all others, you, whom I  associate with all my songs, nightingale, you have come, you have come,  to show yourself to me and to charm me with your notes. Come, you,  who play spring melodies upon the harmonious flute,(1) lead off our  anapaests.(2)    Weak mortals, chained to the earth, creatures of clay as frail as the  foliage of the woods, you unfortunate race, whose life is but darkness,  as unreal as a shadow, the illusion of a dream, hearken to us, who  are immortal beings, ethereal, ever young and occupied with eternal  thoughts, for we shall teach you about all celestial matters; you shall  know thoroughly what is the nature of the birds, what the origin of  the gods, of the rivers, of Erebus, and Chaos; thanks to us, even  Prodicus(3) will envy you your knowledge.    At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and  deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly,  black-winged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite  deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages,  sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the  whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos,  winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the  first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros  had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their  marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods  sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the  dwellers in Olympus. We are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand  proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How  many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have not been  vanquished by our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when  almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail,  a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.(4)    And what important services do not the birds render to mortals! First  of all, they mark the seasons for them, springtime, winter, and autumn.  Does the screaming crane migrate to Libya,--it warns the husbandman  to sow, the pilot to take his ease beside his tiller hung up in his  dwelling,(5) and Orestes(6) to weave a tunic, so that the rigorous cold  may not drive him any more to strip other folk. When the kite reappears,  he tells of the return of spring and of the period when the fleece of  the sheep must be clipped. Is the swallow in sight? All hasten to sell  their warm tunic and to buy some light clothing. We are your Ammon,  Delphi, Dodona, your Phoebus Apollo.(7) Before undertaking anything,  whether a business transaction, a marriage, or the purchase of food,  you consult the birds by reading the omens, and you give this name of  omen(8) to all signs that tell of the future. With you a word is an  omen, you call a sneeze an omen, a meeting an omen, an unknown sound  an omen, a slave or an ass an omen.(9) Is it not clear that we are a  prophetic Apollo to you? If you recognize us as gods, we shall be your  divining Muses, through us you will know the winds and the seasons,  summer, winter, and the temperate months. We shall not withdraw  ourselves to the highest clouds like Zeus, but shall be among you  and shall give to you and to your children and the children of your  children, health and wealth, long life, peace, youth, laughter, songs  and feasts; in short, you will all be so well off, that you will be  weary and satiated with enjoyment.    Oh, rustic Muse of such varied note, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, I sing  with you in the groves and on the mountain tops, tio, tio, tio, tio,  tiotinx.(10) I poured forth sacred strains from my golden throat in  honour of the god Pan,(11) tio, tio, tio, tiotinx, from the top of the  thickly leaved ash, and my voice mingles with the mighty choirs who  extol Cybele on the mountain tops,(12) tototototototototinx. 'Tis to our  concerts that Phrynichus comes to pillage like a bee the ambrosia of  his songs, the sweetness of which so charms the ear, tio, tio, tio, tio,  tinx.    If there be one of you spectators who wishes to spend the rest of  his life quietly among the birds, let him come to us. All that is  disgraceful and forbidden by law on earth is on the contrary honourable  among us, the birds. For instance, among you 'tis a crime to beat your  father, but with us 'tis an estimable deed; it's considered fine to run  straight at your father and hit him, saying, \"Come, lift your spur if  you want to fight.\"(13) The runaway slave, whom you brand, is only a  spotted francolin with us.(14) Are you Phrygian like Spintharus?(15)  Among us you would be the Phrygian bird, the goldfinch, of the race of  Philemon.(16) Are you a slave and a Carian like Execestides? Among us  you can create yourself fore-fathers;(17) you can always find relations.  Does the son of Pisias want to betray the gates of the city to the foe?  Let him become a partridge, the fitting offspring of his father; among  us there is no shame in escaping as cleverly as a partridge.    So the swans on the banks of the Hebrus, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,  mingle their voices to serenade Apollo, tio, tio, tio, tio. tiotinx,  flapping their wings the while, tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx; their notes  reach beyond the clouds of heaven; all the dwellers in the forest stand  still with astonishment and delight; a calm rests upon the waters, and  the Graces and the choirs in Olympus catch up the strain, tio, tio, tio,  tio, tiotinx.    There is nothing more useful nor more pleasant than to have wings. To  begin with, just let us suppose a spectator to be dying with hunger and  to be weary of the choruses of the tragic poets; if he were winged, he"]]]
