MOSAICS.    The pictures known as mosaics are made by fitting together bits of marble,  stone, or glass of different colors and so arranging them as to represent  figures and objects of various kinds, so that at a distance they have much  the same effect as that of pictures painted with brush and colors. The art  of making mosaics is very ancient, and was probably invented in the East,  where it was used for borders and other decorations in regular set  patterns. It was not until after the time of Alexander the Great that the  Greeks used this process for making pictures. At first, too, mosaics were  used for floors or pavements only, and the designs in them were somewhat  like those of the tile pavements of our own time.    This picture of doves will give you a good idea of a mosaic; this subject  is a very interesting one, because it is said to have been first made by  Sosos in Pergamos. It was often repeated in later days, and that from  which our cut is taken was found in the ruins of Hadrian's villa at  Tivoli, near Rome; it is known as the Capitoline Doves, from the fact that  it is now in the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Few works of ancient art are  more admired and as frequently copied as this mosaic: it is not unusual to  see ladies wear brooches with this design in fine mosaic work.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--DOVES SEATED ON A BOWL. _From a mosaic picture in  the Capitol, Rome._]    A few examples of ancient mosaics which were used for wall decorations  have been found; they may almost be said not to exceed a dozen; but  pavement mosaics are very numerous, and are still seen in the places for  which they were designed and where they have been during many centuries,  as well as in museums to which they have been removed. They are so hard in  outline and so mechanical in every way that they are not very attractive  if we think of them as pictures, and their chief interest is in the skill  and patience with which mosaic workers combine the numberless particles  of one substance and another which go to make up the whole.    Mosaic pictures, as a rule, are not large; but one found at Palestrina,  which is called the Nile mosaic, is six by five metres inside. Its subject  is the inundation of a village on the river Nile. There are an immense  number of figures and a variety of scenes in it; there are Egyptians  hunting the Nile horse, a party of revellers in a bower draped with vines,  bands of warriors and other groups of men occupied in different pursuits,  and all represented at the season when the Nile overflows its banks. This  is a very remarkable work, and it has been proved that a portion of the  original is in the Berlin Museum, and has been replaced by a copy at  Palestrina.      PAINTINGS ON STONE.    It is well known that much of the decoration of Greek edifices was in  colors. Of course these paintings were put upon the marble and stone of  which the structures were made. The Greeks also made small pictures and  painted them on stone, just as canvas and panels of wood are now used.  Such painted slabs have been found in Herculaneum, in Corneto, and in  different Etruscan tombs; but the most important and satisfactory one was  found at Pompeii in 1872. Since then the colors have almost vanished; but  Fig. 14, from it, will show you how it appeared when found. It represents  the mythological story of the punishment of Niobe, and is very beautiful  in its design.      VASE-PAINTING.    Vase-painting was another art very much practised by the ancients. So much  can be said of it that it would require more space than we can give for  its history even in outline. So I shall only say that it fills an  important place in historic art, because from the thousands of ancient  vases that have been found in one country and another, much has been  learned concerning the history of these lands and the manners and customs  of their people; occasionally inscriptions are found upon decorated vases  which are of great value to scholars who study the history of the past.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--NIOBE. _From a picture on a slab of granite at  Pompeii._]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE DODWELL VASE. _At Munich._]    The Dodwell vase shows you the more simple style of decoration which was  used in the earlier times. Gradually the designs came to be more and more  elaborate, until whole stories were as distinctly told by the pictures on  vases as if they had been written out in books. The next cut, which is  made from a vase-painting, will show what I mean.    The subject of Fig. 16 is connected with the service of the dead, and  shows a scene in the under world, such as accorded with ancient religious  notions. In the upper portion the friends of the deceased are grouped  around a little temple. Scholars trace the manufacture of these vases back  to very ancient days, and down to its decline, about two centuries before  Christ. I do not mean that vase-painting ceased then, for its latest  traces come down to 65 B.C.; but like all other ancient arts, it was then  in a state of decadence. Though vase-painting was one of the lesser  arts, its importance can scarcely be overestimated, and it fully merits  the devoted study and admiration which it receives from those who are  learned in its history.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--SCENE IN THE LOWER WORLD. _From a vase of the  style of Lower Italy._]    From what we know of ancient Greek painting we may believe that this art  first reached perfection in Greece. If we could see the best works of  Apelles, who reached the highest excellence of any Greek painter, we might  find some lack of the truest science of the art when judged by more modern  standards; but the Greeks must still be credited with having been the  first to create a true art of painting. After the decline of Greek art  fifteen centuries elapsed before painting was again raised to the rank  which the Greeks had given it, and if, according to our ideas, the later  Italian painting is in any sense superior to the Greek, we must at least  admit that the study of the works of antiquity which still remained in  Italy, excited the great masters of the Renaissance to the splendid  achievements which they attained.          CHAPTER II.    MEDIAEVAL PAINTING, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA TO THE  RENAISSANCE.      The Middle Ages extend from the latter part of the fifth century to the  time of the Renaissance, or about the fifteenth century. The painting of  this period has little to attract attention if regarded only from an  artistic stand-point, for we may truly say that, comparing it with the  Greek art which had preceded it, or with the Italian art which followed  it, that of the Middle Ages had no claim to the beautiful. On the other  hand, it is full of interest to students, because it has its part in the  history of art; therefore I shall give a mere outline of it, so that this  link in the chain which unites ancient and modern painting may not be  entirely wanting in our book.    Early mediaeval painting, down to about A.D. 950, consists principally of  paintings in burial-places, mosaics (usually in churches), and of  miniatures, or the illustration and illumination of _MSS._, which were the  books of that time, and were almost without exception religious writings.  This period is called the Early Period of the Middle Ages, and the  pictures are often called the works of Early Christian Art.    About 1050 a revival of intellectual pursuits began in some parts of  Europe, and from that time it may be said that the Renaissance, or new  birth of art and letters, was in its A B Cs, or very smallest beginnings.  The period between 950 and 1250 is often called the Central or Romanesque  Period of the Middle Ages, and it was during this time that glass-painting  originated; it is one of the most interesting features of art in mediaeval  times.    From 1250 to 1400 comes the Final or Gothic Period of the Middle Ages, and  this has some very interesting features which foretell the coming glory of  the great Renaissance.      THE EARLY PERIOD.    The paintings of the catacombs date from the third and fourth centuries  after Christ. The catacombs, or burial-places of the early Christians,  consist of long, narrow, subterranean passages, cut with regularity, and  crossing each other like streets in a city. The graves are in the sides of  these passages, and there are some larger rooms or chambers into which the  narrow passages run. There are about sixty of the catacombs in and near  Rome; they are generally called by the name of some saint who is buried in  them. The paintings are in the chambers, of which there are sometimes  several quite near each other. The reason for their being in these  underground places was that Christians were so persecuted under the  Romans, that they were obliged to do secretly all that they did as  Christians, so that no attention should be attracted to them.    The principal characteristics of these pictures are a simple majesty and  earnestness of effect; perhaps spirituality is the word to use, for by  these paintings the early Christians desired to express their belief in  the religion of Christ, and especially in the immortality of the soul,  which was a very precious doctrine to them. The catacombs of Rome were  more numerous and important than those of any other city.    Many of the paintings in the catacombs had a symbolic meaning, beyond the  plainer intention which appeared at the first sight of them: you will know  what I mean when I say that not only was this picture of Moses striking  the rock intended to represent an historical fact in the life of Moses,  but the flowing water was also regarded as a type of the blessing of  Christian baptism.

Agnes._]    [Illustration"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#6)"],[1,"all claim to the lands of the  Province. Though his offense had been serious, the colonists pardoned  him, and thus ended the career of Coosaponakesee as Empress of Georgia.    And yet, after all, the Rev. Thomas Bosomworth had his way. Mary seems  to have lived long; and her husband pressed her claims in London,  so that, when Henry Ellis was made governor of the Province, he was  authorized, in 1759, to sell the islands of Ossabaw and Sapelo, as well  as other Indian lands near Savannah, and out of the moneys received to  settle the demands of the Bosomworths, and to give them a title to  the Island of St. Catharine, which they had settled and improved. Mary  Bosomworth was given four hundred and fifty pounds for goods she had  expended in the King's service, and it was provided also that she should  be allowed sixteen hundred and fifty pounds for her services as agent.  In addition, she was given two thousand pounds, the sum for which  Ossabaw and Sapelo sold at auction. A grant of St. Catharine Island was  also made to Mary Bosomworth; so that it may be considered that she was  richly rewarded for the many good turns she did the colonists in  her better days, before her mind had been poisoned by the Rev. Mr.  Bosomworth.          THE LIBERTY BOYS.    [Illustration: The Liberty Boys 048]    In 1765, what is known as the Stamp Act was passed by the Parliament of  Great Britain, in spite of all the protests made by the agents of  the Colonies. The people of the Colonies felt that taxation without  representation was an exercise of power not to be tolerated.    The Stamp Act itself was a very small matter; but many of the American  Colonies had been setting up claims of independence in various matters.  As Benjamin Franklin said, the British nation was provoked by these  claims of independence, and all parties proposed by this piece of  legislation to settle the question once for all. While the agents of the  Colonies, and among them Franklin, protested against the Stamp Act, none  of them supposed that it would be met by armed resistance; and yet the  terms of the act were insolent and sweeping. It was provided that if the  stamps were not used, \"marriages would be null and void, notes of  hand valueless, ships at sea prizes to the first captors, suits at  law impossible, transfers of real estate invalid, inheritances  irreclaimable.\" In spite of these sweeping terms, Benjamin Franklin did  not doubt that the act would be carried into effect, and other patriotic  Americans thought that the colonists should submit. Even James Otis of  Boston, who was afterwards among the first to advocate the calling of an  American congress to deliberate upon the propriety of the acts of Great  Britain, was of this opinion.    The Georgia authorities regarded the stamp duty as just as any that  could be generally imposed on the Colonies, though the manner of  imposing it greatly inspired alarm. But while the other Colonies were  hesitating, a voice was heard in Virginia. Patrick Henry, speaking  for the Virginians, made an eloquent protest against the law, and his  boldness kindled into flames the spirit of opposition that had been  smoldering in all the Colonies. The Sons of Liberty were organized  North and South. In Georgia they were known as \"Liberty Boys.\" \"Liberty,  property, and no stamps!\" was the cry, and it was a cry that stirred the  country from one end to the other.    The congress suggested by James Otis of Boston assembled on Monday, the  7th of October, 1765, Georgia had no delegates in the congress, but  was represented by a messenger who was sent to obtain a copy of the  proceedings. Such representation was not because the Colony of Georgia  failed to sympathize with the purpose for which the congress was called,  but was entirely due to the influence and popularity of Governor Wright,  the royal governor, who was not only a good man personally, but wise,  prudent, and far-seeing. Owing to his exertions, Georgia was not  represented in the person of delegates. The speaker of the Georgia  House of Assembly had indeed called a convention of the members for the  purpose of selecting delegates to the Colonial Congress called to meet  in New York, and sixteen members had responded to the call; but such  was the influence of Governor Wright, that these members of the assembly  were prevailed upon not to send delegates to the congress. But they  could not be prevented from preparing and sending a response to the  Massachusetts invitation. They had resolved, they said, to support  heartily every measure that might be suggested for the support of the  common rights of the Colonies.    We learn from the letters of Governor Wright, written to the Earl of  Halifax, that it was as much as he could do (and he was a very active  as well as a very wise governor) to prevail on the people to maintain at  least the outward show of loyalty to the King. And he was not successful  even in this, for he informs another correspondent (Mr. Secretary  Conway) on the 31st of January, 1766, that the same spirit of \"sedition,  or rather rebellion, which first appeared at Boston,\" had reached  Georgia, and that he had been constantly engaged for the space of three  months in trying to convince the people that they ought to submit to the  King's authority until they could point out their grievances and apply  for redress in a constitutional way. Governor Wright also states to  the same correspondent that he has had much trouble in preserving from  destruction at the hands of the people the stamp papers that had been  forwarded for the collection of the tax. He received \"incendiary\"  letters; he had to issue proclamations against riots and \"tumultuous  and unlawful assemblies;\" and he had also to take measures against the  Liberty Boys, who began to have private meetings, and who had formed  themselves into a society to oppose and prevent the distribution of the  stamp papers.    In short, the good governor was kept in a constant state of alarm lest  the Liberty Boys should seize some advantage and cause his Majesty the  King of England to have a moment of grief. The Liberty Boys were so  active, and made so many threatening demonstrations, that Governor  Wright was driven to what he describes as extreme measures. He was  compelled to send the obnoxious stamp papers to a place of safety to  prevent the people from destroying them; and when he had the papers  securely hidden, he was compelled to place men on duty day and night to  protect the precious stamps. He was obliged to send a posse of men to  protect the stamp distributer by hiding him, and was then moved to send  him into the country for a season, in order to avoid the resentment of  the people; and then, after all his trouble, the good governor found  that the people had determined not to apply for any papers, stamped  or unstamped, until the King had acted on the petitions sent from the  Colonies. No wonder that he was moved to call it \"a wretched situation.\"  It was indeed a wretched situation for one who had no higher ideas of  duty than to continue to serve the King and oppose the interests of the  people.    There was something more of an uproar in South Carolina than in Georgia;  but the truth of history appears to be that the resistance offered to  the Stamp Act in Georgia was much more serious than that displayed in  Carolina. Although Governor Wright used all his influence to support the  act, the people exercised so much vigilance in watching the stamp papers  and the officer sent to issue them, that none of the papers found their  way into use.    The Colonies were bordering on a state of revolution, when, through the  influence of the Earl of Chatham, the Stamp Act was repealed. There  was great rejoicing among the people, and a general manifestation of a  renewal of loyalty to the mother country. But the seeds of dissension  had been sown. The Stamp Act unnecessary and uncalled for, had given the  people cause to ponder over their real relations to the Crown; and out  of the discussion that had taken place arose a spirit of independence  that grew and thrived and spread day by day.    In short, the repeal of the Stamp Act gave the people of the Colonies  only momentary satisfaction. Their success in securing its repeal  gave them a new taste for liberty of action, and a new sense of their  importance as individuals. But King George III. was never satisfied with  the repeal of the Stamp Act of 1765. He declared that it had wounded  the Majesty of England. It fretted him, and the irritation that he felt  extended like a contagion to his cabinet. When the Earl of Chatham died,  there was no statesman to take his place. The mantle of his office fell  on Charles Townshend, who was more anxious to please the King than to  secure good government to the people of the Colonies. He was anxious  for the British Government to assert with vigor its right to govern the  Colonies as it saw fit.    Meanwhile the spirit of independence in the Colonies continued to assert  itself more openly day by day, and the determination grew among them  not to submit to taxation without representation in Parliament. The  organization of Sons of Liberty and Liberty Boys grew and spread both  North and South. One of the most fruitful causes of discontent was the  fact that Georgia and the other Colonies were compelled to depend upon  the will of the British Government in all matters. Every act passed by  a colonial assembly must receive the sanction of the British Parliament  before it became a law. Petitions were disregarded. Frequently there  was a delay of two years between the passage of an act by the Colonial  General Assembly and its ratification. But every measure had to receive  the approval of the Crown. While the affairs of the country were in this  peculiar condition, the people became more and more dissatisfied.    It is now known that Governor James Wright, loyal to the King as"]]]
