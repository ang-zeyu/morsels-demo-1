So  _intentional_ is this, that a diaper pattern is often set obliquely to  the vertical lines of the designs, for fear it should appear in any way  connected with them.    Sec. XXXIV. On these russet or crimson backgrounds the entire space of  the series of windows was relieved, for the most part, as a subdued white  field of alabaster; and on this delicate and veined white were set the  circular disks of purple and green. The arms of the family were of  course blazoned in their own proper colors, but I think generally on a  pure azure ground; the blue color is still left behind the shields in  the Casa Priuli and one or two more of the palaces which are unrestored,  and the blue ground was used also to relieve the sculptures of religious  subject. Finally, all the mouldings, capitals, cornices, cusps, and  traceries, were either entirely gilded or profusely touched with gold.    The whole front of a Gothic palace in Venice may, therefore, be simply  described as a field of subdued russet, quartered with broad sculptured  masses of white and gold; these latter being relieved by smaller inlaid  fragments of blue, purple, and deep green.    Sec. XXXV. Now, from the beginning of the fourteenth century, when  painting and architecture were thus united, two processes of change  went on simultaneously to the beginning of the seventeenth. The merely  decorative chequerings on the walls yielded gradually to more elaborate  paintings of figure-subject; first small and quaint, and then enlarging  into enormous pictures filled by figures generally colossal. As these  paintings became of greater merit and importance, the architecture with  which they were associated was less studied; and at last a style was  introduced in which the framework of the building was little more  interesting than that of a Manchester factory, but the whole space of  its walls was covered with the most precious fresco paintings. Such  edifices are of course no longer to be considered as forming an  architectural school; they were merely large preparations of artists'  panels; and Titian, Giorgione, and Veronese no more conferred merit on  the later architecture of Venice, as such, by painting on its facades,  than Landseer or Watts could confer merit on that of London by first  whitewashing and then painting its brick streets from one end to the  other.    Sec. XXXVI. Contemporarily with this change in the relative values of the  color decoration and the stone-work, one equally important was taking  place in the opposite direction, but of course in another group of  buildings. For in proportion as the architect felt himself thrust aside  or forgotten in one edifice, he endeavored to make himself principal in  another; and, in retaliation for the painter's entire usurpation of  certain fields of design, succeeded in excluding him totally from those  in which his own influence was predominant. Or, more accurately  speaking, the architects began to be too proud to receive assistance  from the colorists; and these latter sought for ground which the  architect had abandoned, for the unrestrained display of their own  skill. And thus, while one series of edifices is continually becoming  feebler in design and richer in superimposed paintings, another, that of  which we have so often spoken as the earliest or Byzantine Renaissance,  fragment by fragment rejects the pictorial decoration; supplies its  place first with marbles, and then, as the latter are felt by the  architect, daily increasing in arrogance and deepening in coldness, to  be too bright for his dignity, he casts even these aside one by one: and  when the last porphyry circle has vanished from the facade, we find two  palaces standing side by side, one built, so far as mere masonry goes,  with consummate care and skill, but without the slightest vestige of  color in any part of it; the other utterly without any claim to interest  in its architectural form, but covered from top to bottom with paintings  by Veronese. At this period, then, we bid farewell to color, leaving the  painters to their own peculiar field; and only regretting that they  waste their noblest work on walls, from which in a couple of centuries,  if not before, the greater part of their labor must be effaced. On the  other hand, the architecture whose decline we are tracing, has now  assumed an entirely new condition, that of the Central or True  Renaissance, whose nature we are to examine in the next chapter.    Sec. XXXVII. But before leaving these last palaces over which the  Byzantine influence extended itself, there is one more lesson to be  learned from them of much importance to us. Though in many respects  debased in style, they are consummate in workmanship, and unstained in  honor; there is no imperfection in them, and no dishonesty. That there is  absolutely _no_ imperfection, is indeed, as we have seen above, a proof of  their being wanting in the highest qualities of architecture; but, as  lessons in masonry, they have their value, and may well be studied for the  excellence they display in methods of levelling stones, for the  precision of their inlaying, and other such qualities, which in them are  indeed too principal, yet very instructive in their particular way.    Sec. XXXVIII. For instance, in the inlaid design of the dove with the  olive branch, from the Casa Trevisan (Vol. I. Plate XX. p. 369), it is  impossible for anything to go beyond the precision with which the olive  leaves are cut out of the white marble; and, in some wreaths of laurel  below, the rippled edge of each leaf is as finely and easily drawn, as  if by a delicate pencil. No Florentine table is more exquisitely  finished than the facade of this entire palace; and as ideals of an  executive perfection, which, though we must not turn aside from our main  path to reach it, may yet with much advantage be kept in our sight and  memory, these palaces are most notable amidst the architecture of  Europe. The Rio Facade of the Ducal Palace, though very sparing in  color, is yet, as an example of finished masonry in a vast building, one  of the finest things, not only in Venice, but in the world. It differs  from other work of the Byzantine Renaissance, in being on a very large  scale; and it still retains one pure Gothic character, which adds not a  little to its nobleness, that of perpetual variety. There is hardly one  window of it, or one panel, that is like another; and this continual  change so increases its apparent size by confusing the eye, that, though  presenting no bold features, or striking masses of any kind, there are  few things in Italy more impressive than the vision of it overhead, as  the gondola glides from beneath the Bridge of Sighs. And lastly (unless  we are to blame these buildings for some pieces of very childish  perspective), they are magnificently honest, as well as perfect. I do  not remember even any gilding upon them; all is pure marble, and of the  finest kind.[5]    And therefore, in finally leaving the Ducal Palace,[6] let us take with  us one more lesson, the last which we shall receive from the Stones of  Venice, except in the form of a warning.    Sec. XXXIX. The school of architecture which we have just been examining  is, as we have seen above, redeemed from severe condemnation by its  careful and noble use of inlaid marbles as a means of color. From that  time forward, this art has been unknown, or despised; the frescoes of  the swift and daring Venetian painters long contended with the inlaid  marbles, outvying them with color, indeed more glorious than theirs, but  fugitive as the hues of woods in autumn; and, at last, as the art itself  of painting in this mighty manner failed from among men,[7] the modern  decorative system established itself, which united the meaninglessness  of the veined marble with the evanescence of the fresco, and completed  the harmony by falsehood.    Sec. XL. Since first, in the second chapter of the \"Seven Lamps,\" I  endeavored to show the culpableness, as well as the baseness, of our  common modes of decoration by painted imitation of various woods or  marbles, the subject has been discussed in various architectural works,  and is evidently becoming one of daily increasing interest. When it is  considered how many persons there are whose means of livelihood consist  altogether in these spurious arts, and how difficult it is, even for the  most candid, to admit a conviction contrary both to their interests and  to their inveterate habits of practice and thought, it is rather a  matter of wonder, that the cause of Truth should have found even a few  maintainers, than that it should have encountered a host of adversaries.  It has, however, been defended repeatedly by architects themselves, and  so successfully, that I believe, so far as the desirableness of this or  that method of ornamentation is to be measured by the fact of its simple  honesty or dishonesty, there is little need to add anything to what has  been already urged upon the subject. But there are some points connected  with the practice of imitating marble, which I have been unable to touch  upon until now, and by the consideration of which we may be enabled to  see something of the _policy_ of honesty in this matter, without in the  least abandoning the higher ground of principle.    Sec. XLI. Consider, then, first, what marble seems to have been made for.  Over the greater part of the surface of the world, we find that a rock  has been providentially distributed, in a manner"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30760"],[0,"My Private Menagerie (#6)"],[1,"sores on its  back, and drooping ears, one of those wretched mountebanks' asses that  Decamps and Fouquet used to paint so well. The two baskets balanced on  either side of his raw and prominent backbone contained a troupe of  trained dogs, dressed as marquesses, troubadours, Turks, Alpine  shepherdesses, or Queens of Golconda, according to their sex. The  impresario put down the dogs, cracked his whip, and suddenly every one  of the actors forsook the horizontal for the perpendicular position, and  transformed itself into a biped. The drum and fife started up and the  ballet commenced.    Zamore, who was gravely idling around, stopped smitten with wonder at  the sight. The dogs, dressed in showy colours, braided with imitation  gold lace on every seam, a plumed hat or a turban on their heads, and  moving in cadence to a witching rhythm, with a distant resemblance to  human beings, appeared to him to be supernatural creatures. The  skilfully linked steps, the slides, the pirouettes delighted but did not  discourage him. Like Correggio at the sight of Raphael's painting, he  exclaimed in his canine speech, _Anch' io son pittore!_ and when the  company filed past him, he also, filled with a noble spirit of  emulation, rose up, somewhat uncertainly, upon his hind legs and  attempted to join them, to the great delight of the onlookers.    The manager did not see it in that light, and let fly a smart cut of his  whip at Zamore, who was driven from the circle, just as a spectator  would be ejected from the theatre did he, during the performance, take  on himself to ascend to the stage and to take part in the ballet.    This public humiliation did not check Zamore's vocation. He returned  home with drooping tail and thoughtful mien, and during the whole of the  remainder of that day was more reserved, more taciturn, and more morose  than ever. But in the dead of night my sisters were awakened by slight  sounds, the cause of which they could not conjecture, which proceeded  from an uninhabited room next theirs, where Zamore was usually put to  bed on an old arm-chair. It sounded like a rhythmic tread, made more  sonorous by the silence of night. They at first supposed that the mice  were romping round, but the sound of steps and leaps on the flooring was  too loud for that. The bravest of my sisters rose, partly opened the  door, and by the light of a moonbeam streaming in through a pane, she  beheld Zamore on his hind legs, pawing the air with his fore paws, and  busy studying the dancing steps he had admired in the street that  morning. The gentleman was practising!    Nor did this prove, as might be supposed, a passing fancy, a momentary  attraction; Zamore persisted in his choregraphic aspirations and turned  out a fine dancer. Every time he heard the fife and drum he would run  out on the square, slip between the spectators' legs and watch, with the  closest attention, the trained dogs performing their exercises. Mindful,  however, of the whip-cut, he no longer attempted to take part in the  dancing; he took note of the poses, the steps, and the attitudes, and  then, at night, in the silence of his room, he would work away at them,  remaining the while, during the day, as austere in his bearing as ever.  Ere long he was not satisfied with copying; he took to composing, to  inventing, and I am bound to say few dogs surpassed him in the elevated  style. I often used to watch him through the half-open door; he  practised with such enthusiasm that every night he would drain dry the  bowl of water placed in one corner of the room.    When he had become quite sure of himself and the equal of the most  accomplished of four-footed dancers, he felt he could no longer hide his  light under a bushel and that he must reveal the mystery of his  accomplishments. The court-yard of the house was closed, on one side, by  an iron fence with spaces sufficiently wide to allow moderately stout  dogs to enter in easily. So one fine morning some fifteen or twenty dog  friends of his, connoisseurs no doubt, to whom Zamore had sent letters  of invitation to his debut in the choregraphic art, met around a square  of smooth ground nicely levelled off, which the artist had previously  swept with his tail, and the performance began. The dogs appeared to be  delighted and manifested their enthusiasm by _ouahs!_ _ouahs!_ closely  resembling the _bravi_ of dilettanti at the Opera. With the sole  exception of an old and pretty muddy poodle, very wretched looking, and  a critic, no doubt, who barked out something about forgetting sound  tradition, all the spectators proclaimed Zamore the Vestris of dogs and  the god of dancing. Our artist had performed a minuet, a jig, and a  _deux temps_ waltz. A large number of two-footed spectators had joined  the four-footed ones, and Zamore enjoyed the honour of being applauded  by human hands.    Dancing became so much a habit of his that when he was paying court to  some fair, he would stand up on his hind legs, making bows and turning  his toes out like a marquis of the _ancien regime_. All he lacked was  the plumed hat under his arm.    Apart from this he was as hypochondriacal as a comic actor and took no  part in the life of the household. He stirred only when he saw his  master pick up his hat and stick. Zamore died of brain fever, brought  on, no doubt, by overwork in trying to learn the schottische, then in  the full swing of its popularity. Zamore may say within his tomb, as  says the Greek dancer in her epitaph: \"Earth, rest lightly on me, for I  rested lightly on thee.\"    How came it that being so talented, Zamore was not enrolled in Corvi's  company? For I was even then sufficiently influential as a critic to  manage this for him. Zamore, however, would not leave his master, and  sacrificed his self-love to his affection, a proof of devotion which one  would look for in vain among men.    A singer, named Kobold, a thorough-bred King Charles from the famous  kennels of Lord Lauder, took the place of the dancer. It was a queer  little beast, with an enormous projecting forehead, big goggle eyes,  nose broken short off at the root, and long ears trailing on the ground.  When Kobold was brought to France, knowing no language but English, he  was quite bewildered. He could not understand the orders given him;  trained to answer to \"Go on,\" or \"Come here,\" he remained motionless  when he was told in French, \"Viens,\" or \"Va-t'en.\" It took him a year to  learn the tongue of the new country in which he found himself and to  take part in the conversation. Kobold was very fond of music, and  himself sang little songs with a very strong English accent. The A would  be struck on the piano, and he caught the note exactly and modulated  with a flute-like sound phrases that were really musical and that had no  connection whatever with barking or yelping. When we wanted to make him  go on, all we had to do was to say, \"Sing a little more,\" and he would  repeat the cadence. Although he was fed with the utmost care, as was  proper in the case of a tenor singer and so distinguished a gentleman,  Kobold had one eccentric taste: he would eat earth just like a South  American savage. We never succeeded in curing him of the habit, which  proved the cause of his death. He was very fond of the stablemen, the  horses, and the stable, and my ponies had no more constant companion  than he. He spent his time between their loose-boxes and the piano.    After Kobold, the King Charles, came Myrza, a tiny Havana poodle that  had the honour of being for a time the property of Giulia Grisi, who  gave her to me. She is snow-white, especially when she is fresh from her  bath and has not had time to roll over in the dust, a fancy some dogs  share with dust-loving birds. She is extremely gentle and affectionate,  and as sweet-tempered as a dove. Her little fluffy face, her two little  eyes that might be mistaken for upholstery nails, and her little nose  like a Piedmont truffle, are most comical. Tufts of hair, curly as  Astrakhan fur, fall over her face in the most picturesque and unexpected  way, hiding first one eye and then the other, so that she has the most  peculiar appearance imaginable and squints like a chameleon.    In Myrza, nature imitates the artificial so perfectly that the little  creature looks as if she had stepped out of a toy-shop. When her coat is  nicely curled, and she has got on her blue ribbon bow and her silver  bell, she is the image of a toy dog, and when she barks it is impossible  not to wonder whether there is a bellows under her paws.    She spends three-fourths of her time in sleep, and her life would not be  much changed were she stuffed, nor does she seem particularly clever in  the ordinary intercourse of life. Yet she one day exhibited an amount of  intelligence absolutely unparalleled in my experience. Bonnegrace, the  painter of the portraits of Tchoumakoff and E. H., which attracted so  much attention at the exhibitions, had brought to me, in order to get my  opinion upon it, one of his portraits painted in the manner of Pagnest,  remarkable for truthfulness of colour and vigour of modelling. Although  I have lived on terms of closest intimacy with animals and could tell a  hundred traits of the ingenuity, reasoning, and philosophical powers of  cats, dogs, and birds, I am bound to confess that animals wholly lack  any feeling for art. Never have I seen a single one notice a picture,  and the story of the birds that picked at the grapes in the painting by  Zeuxis, strikes me as a piece of invention. It is precisely the feeling  for ornament and art that distinguishes man from brutes. Dogs never look  at pictures and never put on earrings. Well, Myrza, at the sight of the  portrait placed against the wall by Bonnegrace, sprang from the stool on  which she was lying curled up, dashed at the canvas and barked furiously  at it, trying to bite the stranger who had made his way into the room."]]]
