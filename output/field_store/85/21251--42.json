The seal set to the king's charter is the  king's image, imbossed or moulded in gold; and though such charters be  expedited of course, and as of right, yet they are varied by  discretion, according to the number and dignity of the family.  This  charter the herald readeth aloud; and while it is read, the father or  Tirsan standeth up supported by two of his sons, such as he chooseth.  Then the herald mounteth the half-pace and delivereth the charter into  his hand: and with that there is an acclamation by all that are present  in their language, which is thus much: Happy are the people of Bensalem.    Then the herald taketh into his hand from the other child the cluster  of grapes, which is of gold, both the stalk and the grapes.  But the  grapes are daintily enamelled; and if the males of the family be the  greater number, the grapes are enamelled purple, with a little sun set  on the top; if the females, then they are enamelled into a greenish  yellow, with a crescent on the top.  The grapes are in number as many  as there are descendants of the family.  This golden cluster the herald  delivereth also to the Tirsan; who presently delivereth it over to that  son that he had formerly chosen to be in house with him: who beareth it  before his father as an ensign of honour when he goeth in public, ever  after; and is thereupon called the Son of the Vine.    After the ceremony endeth the father or Tirsan retireth; and after some  time cometh forth again to dinner, where he sitteth alone under the  state, as before; and none of his descendants sit with him, of what  degree or dignity soever, except he hap to be of Salomon's House. He is  served only by his own children, such as are male; who perform unto him  all service of the table upon the knee; and the women only stand about  him, leaning against the wall.  The room below the half-pace hath  tables on the sides for the guests that are bidden; who are served with  great and comely order; and towards the end of dinner (which in the  greatest feasts with them lasteth never above an hour and an half)  there is an hymn sung, varied according to the invention of him that  composeth it (for they have excellent posy) but the subject of it is  (always) the praises of Adam and Noah and Abraham; whereof the former  two peopled the world, and the last was the Father of the Faithful:  concluding ever with a thanksgiving for the nativity of our Saviour, in  whose birth the births of all are only blessed.    Dinner being done, the Tirsan retireth again; and having withdrawn  himself alone into a place, where he makes some private prayers, he  cometh forth the third time, to give the blessing with all his  descendants, who stand about him as at the first.  Then he calleth them  forth by one and by one, by name, as he pleaseth, though seldom the  order of age be inverted.  The person that is called (the table being  before removed) kneeleth down before the chair, and the father layeth  his hand upon his head, or her head, and giveth the blessing in these  words: Son of Bensalem, (or daughter of Bensalem,) thy father with it:  the man by whom thou hast breath and life speaketh the word: the  blessing of the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, and the Holy  Dove, be upon thee, and make the days of thy pilgrimage good and many.  This he saith to every of them; and that done, if there be any of his  sons of eminent merit and virtue, (so they be not above two,) he  calleth for them again; and saith, laying his arm over their shoulders,  they standing; Sons, it is well ye are born, give God the praise, and  persevere to the end.  And withall delivereth to either of them a  jewel, made in the figure of an ear of wheat, which they ever after  wear in the front of their turban or hat.  This done, they fall to  music and dances, and other recreations, after their manner, for the  rest of the day.  This is the full order of that feast.    By that time six or seven days were spent, I was fallen into straight  acquaintance with a merchant of that city, whose name was Joabin.  He  was a Jew and circumcised: for they have some few stirps of Jews yet  remaining among them, whom they leave to their own religion.  Which  they may the better do, because they are of a far differing disposition  from the Jews in other parts.  For whereas they hate the name of  Christ; and have a secret inbred rancour against the people among whom  they live: these (contrariwise) give unto our Saviour many high  attributes, and love the nation of Bensalem extremely.  Surely this man  of whom I speak would ever acknowledge that Christ was born of a virgin  and that he was more than a man; and he would tell how God made him  ruler of the seraphims which guard his throne; and they call him also  the Milken Way, and the Eliah of the Messiah; and many other high  names; which though they be inferior to his divine majesty, yet they  are far from the language of other Jews.    And for the country of Bensalem, this man would make no end of  commending it; being desirous, by tradition among the Jews there, to  have it believed that the people thereof were of the generations of  Abraham, by another son, whom they call Nachoran; and that Moses by a  secret Cabala ordained the Laws of Bensalem which they now use; and  that when the Messiah should come, and sit in his throne at Hierusalem,  the king of Bensalem should sit at his feet, whereas other kings should  keep a great distance.  But yet setting aside these Jewish dreams, the  man was a wise man, and learned, and of great policy, and excellently  seen in the laws and customs of that nation.    Amongst other discourses, one day I told him I was much affected with  the relation I had, from some of the company, of their custom, in  holding the Feast of the Family; for that (methought) I had never heard  of a solemnity wherein nature did so much preside.  And because  propagation of families proceedeth from the nuptial copulation, I  desired to know of him what laws and customs they had concerning  marriage; and whether they kept marriage well and whether they were  tied to one wife; for that where population is so much affected,' and  such as with them it seemed to be, there is commonly permission of  plurality of wives.    To this he said, \"You have reason for to commend that excellent  institution of the Feast of the Family.  And indeed we have experience  that those families that are partakers of the blessing of that feast do  flourish and prosper ever after in an extraordinary manner.  But hear  me now, and I will tell you what I know.  You shall understand that  there is not under the heavens so chaste a nation as this of Bensalem;  nor so free from all pollution or foulness.  It is the virgin of the  world.  I remember I have read in one of your European books, of an  holy hermit amongst you that desired to see the Spirit of Fornication;  and there appeared to him a little foul ugly Aethiop. But if he had  desired to see the Spirit of Chastity of Bensalem, it would have  appeared to him in the likeness of a fair beautiful Cherubim.  For  there is nothing amongst mortal men more fair and admirable, than the  chaste minds of this people.  Know therefore, that with them there are  no stews, no dissolute houses, no courtesans, nor anything of that  kind.  Nay they wonder (with detestation) at you in Europe, which  permit such things.  They say ye have put marriage out of office: for  marriage is ordained a remedy for unlawful concupiscence; and natural  concupiscence seemeth as a spar to marriage. But when men have at hand  a remedy more agreeable to their corrupt will, marriage is almost  expulsed.  And therefore there are with you seen infinite men that  marry not, but chose rather a libertine and impure single life, than to  be yoked in marriage; and many that do marry, marry late, when the  prime and strength of their years is past. And when they do marry, what  is marriage to them but a very bargain; wherein is sought alliance, or  portion, or reputation, with some desire (almost indifferent) of issue;  and not the faithful nuptial union of man and wife, that was first  instituted.  Neither is it possible that those that have cast away so  basely so much of their strength, should greatly esteem children,  (being of the same matter,) as chaste men do.  So likewise during  marriage, is the case much amended, as it ought to be if those things  were tolerated only for necessity?  No, but they remain still as a very  affront to marriage. The haunting of those dissolute places, or resort  to courtesans, are no more punished in married men than in bachelors.  And the depraved custom of change, and the delight in meretricious  embracements, (where sin is turned into art,) maketh marriage a dull  thing, and a kind of imposition or tax.  They hear you defend these  things, as done to avoid greater evils; as advoutries, deflowering of  virgins, unnatural lust, and the like.  But they say this is a  preposterous wisdom; and they call it Lot's offer, who to save his  guests from abusing, offered his daughters: nay they say farther that  there is little gained in this; for that the same vices and appetites  do still remain and abound; unlawful lust being like a furnace, that if  you stop the flames altogether, it will quench; but if you give it any  vent, it will rage. As for masculine love, they have no touch of it;  and yet there are not so faithful and inviolate friendships in the  world again as are there; and to speak generally, (as I said before,) I  have not read of any such chastity, in any people as theirs.  And their  usual saying is, That whosoever is unchaste cannot reverence himself;  and they say, That the reverence of a man's self, is, next to religion,  the chiefest bridle of all vices.\"    And when he had said this, the good Jew paused a little; whereupon I,  far more willing to hear him speak on than to speak"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24350"],[0,"Kerfol (#6)"],[1,"was received into their Order, and without achieving any  particular distinction he followed its good and evil fortunes till his  death some twenty years later. Lanrivain showed me a portrait of him by  a pupil of Philippe de Champaigne: sad eyes, an impulsive mouth and a  narrow brow. Poor Herve de Lanrivain: it was a grey ending. Yet as  I looked at his stiff and sallow effigy, in the dark dress of the  Janseniste, I almost found myself envying his fate. After all, in the  course of his life two great things had happened to him: he had loved  romantically, and he must have talked with Pascal...."]]]
