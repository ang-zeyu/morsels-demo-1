They  can sting pretty severely, but I do not think they are so ready to use  their defensive weapon as a wasp or hive bee is. The length of the tongue  in these creatures makes them of great value to the farmer and gardener, as  they can fertilize the red clover and probably other flowers which require  a longer tongue to reach the nectary than is possessed by the hive bee.  {40} In New Zealand, when first the red clover was introduced from this  country, it was found impossible to fertilize it, and humble bees had to be  sent out. Now they are established there its fertilization is carried on  quite successfully. The humble bees are divided into two natural groups,  the underground species, i.e. those that make a subterranean nest, and the  carder bees, as they have been called, which make a nest on the surface of  the ground. The former live in much larger communities and are far more  aggressive and pugnacious than the latter. They also feed their young,  according to Mr. F. W. L. Sladen, of Ripple Court, in a different way. The  carder bees \"form little pockets or pouches of wax at the side of a  wax-covered mass of growing larvae into which the workers drop the pellets  of pollen direct from their hind tibiae. The pollen storers, on the  contrary, store the newly gathered pollen in waxen cells, made for the  purpose, or in old cocoons, specially set apart to receive it, from which  it is taken and given to the larvae mixed with honey through the mouths of  the nurse-bees as required.\" As the author remarks, the methods of the  underground {41} species more resemble those of the hive bee than do those  of the carder bees. Mr. Sladen has made many experiments in trying to  domesticate humble bees, and succeeded so far with _Bombus terrestris_ (pl.  D, 29, our common black and yellow banded species with a tawny tail) as to  get it to breed in captivity, and in 1899 was able to show nests in full  work at the Maidstone agricultural show, the bees coming in and out of the  building to their nest. An interesting case of one of the carder bees  (_Bombus agrorum_) is recorded by F. Smith. It invaded a wren's nest,  heaping up its pollen, etc., amongst the eggs of the bird, till the parent  bird was forced to desert the nest. The underground species are more  subject to the attacks of cuckoos than the carder bees. Altogether the  humble bees afford an excellent subject for study, as they appear to be  amenable to treatment, and to any one who could give time and careful  attention to them many interesting problems connected with them and not yet  understood might have light thrown upon them. Dead humble bees are often  found in numbers in a mutilated state, under lime trees. These {42} have  been caught after they have filled themselves with honey, and become torpid  in consequence, by the great tomtit and possibly other birds. The bird  pecks a hole in the insect's thorax, enjoys the honey it has eaten and then  drops the quivering body which falls to the ground. I once had the  opportunity of seeing this slaughter going on, and was able to detect the  great tomtit as the murderer.    In colour the humble bees vary remarkably, the variation occurring chiefly  in the females. This variation is not so noticeable in this country,  although in many species even here the variability is very great, but when  we trace a common species such as _terrestris_, which varies very little  here, over a large area such as the Palaearctic region its liveries are so  diverse that its females have been treated as belonging to many different  species. In the Siberian district its yellow bands become of a pale, almost  whitish or straw colour, and the whole appearance of the insect is altered.  If, instead of going north, we go to the Mediterranean region we find a  large, fine form tolerably common, with bright yellow hairs on the legs. In  Corsica {43} again we find a quite different form; entirely black except  for the bright red hairs on the apex of the body, and bright red tibiae,  clothed with red hairs. In the Canaries another coloration occurs: the  whole insect is black with the exception of the apex of the body which is  clothed with white hairs; but in all these the male varies comparatively  little. In the Siberian and Canary forms it resembles the female, but in  the others it varies very little from some varieties we find here. A rather  similar series of varieties occurs in _Bombus hortorum_, another species  little liable to variation here. In Italy and south-east Europe a form with  entirely black body and black wings occurs, and in Corsica a black form  with reddish hairs on the apical segments. The male keeps throughout very  constant to its normal coloration. The tendency to vary towards an entirely  black form seems to exist in nearly all the species, although in Britain  black varieties of some are very rare.           *       *       *       *       *    {44}    THE BEES WITH BIFID TONGUES    In this country we have only two genera in which the tongue is bifid at the  apex, and on this account they are kept together as close allies in our  classification. They are, however, very different in general appearance.  One of these groups is called _Colletes_, on account of its habit of lining  its cells with a gluey material, the other, _Prosopis_, on account of the  markings on the face. The various kinds of _Colletes_ are densely clothed  on the head and thorax with brownish hairs, and the segments of the body  have whitish bands composed of a dense, tight-fitting, duvet of hairs (pl.  B, 10). There is in this country only one exception, a large insect like a  hive bee, but rarely met with, its headquarters being the Wallasey  Sandhills near Liverpool, and other localities in Lancashire. All the  species tend to colonize; some building in huge colonies {45} in sandy  cuttings, etc. They are preyed upon by a pretty little cuckoo bee called  _Epeolus_ (pl. B, 19), which is black, ornamented with brownish red and  whitish spots. One of our best known species, _Colletes fodiens_, can often  be found in abundance on the heads of ragwort along the sea-coast in July.    The other genus _Prosopis_ is outwardly entirely unlike _Colletes_: its  species are nearly all very small coal-black insects, with scarcely any  noticeable hairs, rather unusually narrow and cylindrical in form; they  emit a peculiar, agreeably scented fluid when handled; in the males the  face is almost always white or yellow, in the females there is generally a  yellow spot on each side near the eye. These little creatures are  especially fond of burrowing in bramble stems. They like those which have  been cut off in trimming the hedges, because in them the pith is exposed  and they can burrow their way into it without gnawing through the wood. If  any one, going along a hedge which has been trimmed, containing a lot of  brambles, in the autumn or winter, would examine the cut-off ends they  would soon find some with holes in them. These {46} may be the work of  _Prosopis_, but there are other bees and fossors which also burrow in this  way. So the stems should be brought home and opened. Then the _Prosopis_  cells may be known by the fine membranous pellicle which surrounds them,  but possibly even then a little jewel-bee cuckoo may be found in possession  of the cell, instead of the rightful owner. When these little bees emerge  they are generally to be found on wild mignonette, bramble flowers or those  of the wild parsley tribe. Some are very common, others of great rarity.  The males of this genus seem to have a peculiar tendency to develop  eccentricities in the shape of the first joint of the antennae, or feelers,  some having it expanded and concave, others rounded but thickened towards  the apex; in only one British species, _P. cornuta_, does the female show  any special peculiarity of form, but in this the face is produced on each  side between the eyes into a distinct horn-shaped process. In the females  there is scarcely any indication of pollen brush, and for this reason they  used to be considered as possessors of cuckoo instincts, but there is now  no doubt of their industrious habits; but {47} there is no other genus of  industrious bees in this country, with the exception of _Ceratina_, with so  little specialization for pollen collecting.           *       *       *       *       *    {48}    THE BEES WITH POINTED TONGUES    All the genera, except the two mentioned in the last chapter, belong to  this section, which comprises a variety of very different styles of bees,  beginning with the short spear-shape-tongued species and ascending to the  long-tongued species, which are considered to culminate in the hive bee.  The habits of these genera vary very greatly in some respects; special  notice has been or will be given of _Halictus_ (pl. B, 12) and _Sphecodes_  (B, 11), _Andrena_ (B, 15, 16), _Nomada_ (B, 18) and the other cuckoos,  _Osmia_ (D, 28) and _Anthophora_ (D, 24, 25) and the leaf-cutting bees, but  there are several other genera which deserve a passing notice, although  their habits are not so peculiar as those of the specially selected ones.  _Cilissa_, which is a very close ally of _Andrena_, is peculiar in having  the hairs of the tongue erect and arranged almost in bottle-brush fashion.  Its habits are much like those of {49} _Andrena_. _Dasypoda_, so called on  account of the enormously long hairs of the pollen brushes of the legs in  the female, is one of our most beautiful bees; it is of moderate size, a  little more than half an inch long, with a brown haired thorax, and a black  body with white apical bands on the segments; the hind legs are rather  unusually long and the brush is composed of very long bright fulvous hairs,  and when the bee returns home laden with pollen it is, as F. Smith says,  \"sufficiently singular to attract the attention of the most apathetic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33914"],[0,"Myology and Serology of the Avian Family Fringillidae: A Taxonomic Study (#6)"],[1," to the medial surface of the tarsometatarsus, passes  distally, and perforates the sheathlike tendon of the _m. flexor  hallucis brevis_ between the first metatarsal and the trochlea for  digit II. The tendon continues along the posterior surface of the  hallux and has a double insertion; the main tendon attaches to the  base of the ungual phalanx and a smaller branch inserts on the distal  end of the proximal phalanx.    Action.--Flexes hallux.    Comparison.--In _Vireo_ this muscle has only the posterior head of  origin and is not connected with the _m. flexor perforatus digiti II_.  The muscle is proportionately smaller and weaker than in any of the  other species studied.      _+Musculus extensor hallucis longus+_ (Fig. 4).--One of the smallest  muscles of the leg, the origin is fleshy from the anteromedial edge of  the proximal end of the tarsometatarsus. The belly is long and slender  and terminates distally in a slender tendon which passes distally  along the posterior surfaces of the first metatarsal and the first  digit. The insertion is on the base of the ungual phalanx. Near the  distal end of the proximal phalanx, the tendon passes between two  thick bands of fibro-elastic tissue which insert also on the ungual  phalanx. These bands of tissue function as automatic extensors of the  claw.    Action.--Extends hallux; action must be slight.    Comparison.--In _Vireo_ this muscle is proportionately larger and  better developed than it is in any of the other species examined.      _+Musculus flexor hallucis brevis+_ (Fig. 4).--This minute muscle has  a fleshy origin from the medial surface of the hypotarsus. The short  belly terminates in a weak, slender tendon which passes down the  posteromedial surface of the tarsometatarsus and into the space  between the first metatarsal and the trochlea for digit II. In this  region the tendon envelops the tendon of the _m. flexor hallucis  longus_ and inserts on the distal end of the first metatarsal and on  the proximal end of the first phalanx of the first digit.    Action.--Flexes hallux; action must be slight.    Comparison.--The small size of this muscle makes it exceedingly  difficult to study. The muscle is larger in _Vireo_ than in any of the  other species examined. This may be correlated with the smaller size  of the _m. flexor hallucis longus_ in this species. The muscle does  not seem to be so well developed in the cardueline finches as it is in  the other species.      _+Musculus abductor digiti IV+_ (Fig. 2).--Extremely small, delicate  and difficult to demonstrate, this muscle arises in a fleshy origin  immediately from underneath the posterior edge of the external cotyla  of the tarsometatarsus. The tendon of insertion is long and slender  and inserts along the lateral edge of the first phalanx of digit IV.    Action.--Abducts digit IV.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus lumbricalis.+_--Semitendinous throughout its length, this  muscle arises from the ossified tendon of the _m. flexor digitorum  longus_ at a point immediately proximal to the branching of this  tendon. The insertion is on the joint pulleys and capsules at the base  of the third and fourth digits.    Action.--Hudson (1937:57) states that: \"Meckel (_vide_ Gadow--1891, p.  204) considered this muscle as serving to draw the joint pulley behind  in order to protect it from pinching during the bending of the toes.  It perhaps also tends to flex the third and fourth digits.\"    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      Discussion of the Myological Investigations    Simpson (1944:12) and others have emphasized that different parts of  organisms evolve at different rates. Beecher (1951b:275) in stating  that \"... the hind limb is very similar in muscle pattern throughout  the Order Passeriformes and seems to have become relatively static  after attaining a high level of general efficiency ...\" implies that  the muscle pattern of the leg must be one of long standing and slow  change. This concept was emphasized by Hudson (1937) who found but  little variation in muscle pattern among members of the several  families of passerine birds. The concept is further confirmed by the  present investigation. The intricate patterns of origin and of  insertion seem to remain almost the same throughout the order in spite  of adaptive radiation which has occurred.    Two major differences in patterns of leg-musculature, however, were  found among the species studied, and these differences are significant  since they are consistent between subfamilies. The muscles involved  are the _m. obturator externus_ and the _pars interna_ of the _m.  gastrocnemius_.    The _m. obturator externus_ is bipartite, consisting of dorsal and  ventral parts, in the passerine species studied by Hudson (1937) and  in all of the species examined by me except the ploceids and the  cardueline finches. In the ploceids and cardueline finches this muscle  is undivided and resembles in its position, origin, and insertion only  the ventral portion of the muscle found in the other birds studied. It  is difficult to imagine what advantage or disadvantage might be  associated with the bipartite or with the undivided condition. The  action of this muscle is to rotate the femur (right femur clockwise,  left femur counterclockwise), and certainly the greater mass of the  bipartite muscle could lend greater strength to such action. The  possible significance of this is discussed below.         List of Abbreviations Used in Figures      Abd. dig.
