[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#6)"],[1,"novelty,--a description  that generally fits the facts of the case about as well as your coat  fits the chair-back. Strange and curious things in the air, and in the  water, and in the earth beneath, are seen every day except by those who  are looking for them, namely, the naturalists. When Wilson or Audubon  gets his eye on the unknown bird, the illusion vanishes, and your  phenomenon turns out to be one of the commonplaces of the fields or  woods.          THE BROWN THRASHER      Our long-tailed thrush, or thrasher, delights in a high branch of some  solitary tree, whence it will pour out its rich and intricate warble for  an hour together. This bird is the great American chipper. There is no  other bird that I know of that can chip with such emphasis and military  decision as this yellow-eyed songster. It is like the click of a giant  gunlock. Why is the thrasher so stealthy? It always seems to be going  about on tip-toe. I never knew it to steal anything, and yet it skulks  and hides like a fugitive from justice. One never sees it flying aloft  in the air and traversing the world openly, like most birds, but it  darts along fences and through bushes as if pursued by a guilty  conscience. Only when the musical fit is upon it does it come up into  full view, and invite the world to hear and behold.    Years pass without my finding a brown thrasher's nest; it is not a nest  you are likely to stumble upon in your walk; it is hidden as a miser  hides his gold, and watched as jealously. The male pours out his rich  and triumphant song from the tallest tree he can find, and fairly  challenges you to come and look for his treasures in his vicinity. But  you will not find them if you go. The nest is somewhere on the outer  circle of his song; he is never so imprudent as to take up his stand  very near it. The artists who draw those cozy little pictures of a  brooding mother bird, with the male perched but a yard away in full  song, do not copy from nature. The thrasher's nest I found was thirty or  forty rods from the point where the male was wont to indulge in his  brilliant recitative. It was in an open field under a low  ground-juniper. My dog disturbed the sitting bird as I was passing near.  The nest could be seen only by lifting up and parting away the branches.  All the arts of concealment had been carefully studied. It was the last  place you would think of looking in, and, if you did look, nothing was  visible but the dense green circle of the low-spreading juniper. When  you approached, the bird would keep her place till you had begun to stir  the branches, when she would start out, and, just skimming the ground,  make a bright brown line to the near fence and bushes. I confidently  expected that this nest would escape molestation, but it did not. Its  discovery by myself and dog probably opened the door for ill luck, as  one day, not long afterward, when I peeped in upon it, it was empty. The  proud song of the male had ceased from his accustomed tree, and the  pair were seen no more in that vicinity.    After a pair of nesting birds have been broken up once or twice during  the season, they become almost desperate, and will make great efforts to  outwit their enemies. A pair of brown thrashers built their nest in a  pasture-field under a low, scrubby apple-tree which the cattle had  browsed down till it spread a thick, wide mass of thorny twigs only a  few inches above the ground. Some blackberry briers had also grown  there, so that the screen was perfect. My dog first started the bird, as  I was passing near. By stooping low and peering intently, I could make  out the nest and eggs. Two or three times a week, as I passed by, I  would pause to see how the nest was prospering. The mother bird would  keep her place, her yellow eyes never blinking. One morning, as I looked  into her tent, I found the nest empty. Some night-prowler, probably a  skunk or a fox, or maybe a black snake or a red squirrel by day, had  plundered it. It would seem as if it was too well screened; it was in  such a spot as any depredator would be apt to explore. \"Surely,\" he  would say, \"this is a likely place for a nest.\" The birds then moved  over the hill a hundred rods or more, much nearer the house, and in some  rather open bushes tried again. But again they came to grief. Then,  after some delay, the mother bird made a bold stroke. She seemed to  reason with herself thus: \"Since I have fared so disastrously in seeking  seclusion for my nest, I will now adopt the opposite tactics, and come  out fairly in the open. What hides me hides my enemies: let us try  greater publicity.\" So she came out and built her nest by a few small  shoots that grew beside the path that divides the two vineyards, and  where we passed to and fro many times daily. I discovered her by chance  early in the morning as I proceeded to my work. She started up at my  feet and flitted quickly along above the ploughed ground, almost as red  as the soil. I admired her audacity. Surely no prowler by night or day  would suspect a nest in this open and exposed place. There was no cover  by which they could approach, and no concealment anywhere. The nest was  a hasty affair, as if the birds' patience at nest-building had been  about exhausted. Presently an egg appeared, and then the next day  another, and on the fourth day a third. No doubt the bird would have  succeeded this time had not man interfered. In cultivating the vineyards  the horse and cultivator had to pass over this very spot. Upon this the  bird had not calculated. I determined to assist her. I called my man,  and told him there was one spot in that vineyard, no bigger than his  hand, where the horse's foot must not be allowed to fall, nor tooth of  cultivator to touch. Then I showed him the nest, and charged him to  avoid it. Probably if I had kept the secret to myself, and let the bird  run her own risk, the nest would have escaped. But the result was that  the man, in elaborately trying to avoid the nest, overdid the matter;  the horse plunged, and set his foot squarely upon it. Such a little  spot, the chances were few that the horse's foot would fall exactly  there; and yet it did, and the birds' hopes were again dashed. The pair  then disappeared from my vicinity, and I saw them no more.          THE HOUSE WREN      A few years ago I put up a little bird-house in the back end of my  garden for the accommodation of the wrens, and every season a pair have  taken up their abode there. One spring a pair of bluebirds looked into  the tenement and lingered about several days, leading me to hope that  they would conclude to occupy it. But they finally went away, and later  in the season the wrens appeared, and, after a little coquetting, were  regularly installed in their old quarters, and were as happy as only  wrens can be.    One of our younger poets, Myron Benton, saw a little bird        \"Ruffled with whirlwind of his ecstasies,\"    which must have been the wren, as I know of no other bird that so throbs  and palpitates with music as this little vagabond. And the pair I speak  of seemed exceptionally happy, and the male had a small tornado of song  in his crop that kept him \"ruffled\" every moment in the day. But before  their honeymoon was over the bluebirds returned. I knew something was  wrong before I was up in the morning. Instead of that voluble and  gushing song outside the window, I heard the wrens scolding and crying  at a fearful rate, and on going out saw the bluebirds in possession of  the box. The poor wrens were in despair; they wrung their hands and tore  their hair, after the wren fashion, but chiefly did they rattle out  their disgust and wrath at the intruders. I have no doubt that, if it  could have been interpreted, it would have been proven the rankest and  most voluble billingsgate ever uttered. For the wren is saucy, and he  has a tongue in his head that can outwag any other tongue known to me.    The bluebirds said nothing, but the male kept an eye on Mr. Wren, and,  when he came too near, gave chase, driving him to cover under the fence,  or under a rubbish-heap or other object, where the wren would scold and  rattle away, while his pursuer sat on the fence or the pea-brush waiting  for him to reappear.    Days passed, and the usurpers prospered and the outcasts were wretched;  but the latter lingered about, watching and abusing their enemies, and  hoping, no doubt, that things would take a turn, as they presently did.  The outraged wrens were fully avenged. The mother bluebird had laid her  full complement of eggs and was beginning to set, when one day, as her  mate was perched above her on the barn, along came a boy with one of  those wicked elastic slings and cut him down with a pebble. There he  lay like a bit of sky fallen upon the grass. The widowed bird seemed to  understand what had happened, and without much ado disappeared next day  in quest of another mate.    In the mean time the wrens were beside themselves with delight; they  fairly screamed with joy. If the male was before \"ruffled with whirlwind  of his ecstasies,\" he was now in danger of being rent asunder. He  inflated his throat and caroled as wren never caroled before. And the  female, too, how she cackled and darted about! How busy they both were!  Rushing into the nest, they hustled those eggs out in less than a  minute, wren time. They carried in new material, and by the third day  were fairly installed again in their old quarters; but on the third day,  so rapidly are these little dramas played, the female bluebird  reappeared with another mate. Ah! how the wren stock went down then!  What dismay and despair filled again those little breasts! It was  pitiful. They did not scold as before, but after a day or two withdrew  from the garden, dumb with grief, and gave up the struggle.           *       *       *       *       *    The chatter of a second brood of nearly fledged wrens is heard now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#6)"],[1,"Once, \"Snowball,\" the  faithful team leader of four years past, who has helped to haul my sled  nearly ten thousand miles, broke through a snow bridge and, the  belly-band parting, slipped out of his collar and fell some twenty feet  below to a ledge in a crevasse. Walter was let down and rescued the poor  brute, trembling but uninjured. Without the dogs we should have been  much delayed and could hardly, one judges, have moved the wood forward  at all. The work on the glacier was the beginning of the ceaseless grind  which the ascent of Denali demands.    [Illustration: Ascension Day, 1913.]    How intolerably hot it was, on some of these days, relaying the stuff up  the glacier! I shall never forget Ascension Day, which occurred this  year on the 1st May. Double feast as it was--for SS. Philip and James  falls on that day--it was a day of toil and penance. With the mercurial  barometer and a heavy pack of instruments and cameras and films on my  back and the rope over my shoulder, bent double hauling at the sled, I  trudged along all day, panting and sweating, through four or five inches  of new-fallen snow, while the glare of the sun was terrific. It seemed  impossible that, surrounded entirely by ice and snow, with millions of  tons of ice underfoot, it _could_ be so hot. But we took the loads right  through to the head of the glacier that day, rising some four thousand  feet in the course of five miles, and cached them there. On other days a  smother of mist lay all over the glacier surface, with never a breath of  wind, and the air seemed warm and humid as in an Atlantic coast city in  July. Yet again, starting early in the morning, sometimes a zero  temperature nipped toes and fingers and a keen wind cut like a knife.  Sometimes it was bitterly cold in the mornings, insufferably hot at  noon, and again bitterly cold toward night. It was a pity we had no  black-bulb, sun-maximum thermometer amongst our instruments, for one is  sure its readings would have been of great interest.    It was a pity, also, that we had no means of making an attempt at  measuring the rate of movement of this glacier--a subject we often  discussed. The carriage of poles enough to set out rows of them across  the glacier would have greatly increased our loads and the time required  to transport them. But it is certain that its rate of movement is very  slow in general, though faster at certain spots than at others, and a  reason for this judgment will be given later.    [Illustration: Bridging a crevasse on the Muldrow Glacier.]    [Sidenote: The Fire on the Glacier]    The midway cache between our first and last glacier camps was itself the  scene of a camp we had not designed, for on the day we were moving  finally forward we were too fatigued to press on to the spot that had  been selected at the head of the glacier, and by common consent made a  halt at the cache and set up the tent there. This is mentioned because  it had consequences. If we had gone through that day and had established  ourselves at the selected spot, a disaster that befell us would, in all  probability, not have happened; for the next day, instead of moving our  camp forward, we relayed some stuff and cached it where the camp would  be made, covering the cache with the three small silk tents. Then we sat  around awhile and ate our luncheon, and presently went down for another  load. Imagine our surprise, upon returning some hours later, to see a  column of smoke rising from our cache. All sorts of wild speculations  flew through the writer's mind as, in the lead that day, he first  crested the serac that gave view of the cache. Had some mysterious  climber come over from the other side of the mountain and built a fire  on the glacier? Had he discovered our wood and our grub and, perhaps  starving, kindled a fire of the one to cook the other? Was there really,  then, some access to this face of the mountain from the south? For it is  fixed in the mind of the traveller in the north beyond eradication that  _smoke_ must mean _man_. But ere we had gone much farther the truth  dawned upon us that our cache was on fire, and we left the dogs and the  sleds and hurried to the spot. Something we were able to save, but not  much, though we were in time to prevent the fire from spreading to our  far-hauled wood. And the explanation was not far to seek. After luncheon  Karstens and the writer had smoked their pipes, and one or the other had  thrown a careless match away that had fallen unextinguished upon the  silk tents that covered the cache. Presently a little wind had fanned  the smouldering fabric into flame, which had eaten down into the pile of  stuff below, mostly in wooden cases. All our sugar was gone, all our  powdered milk, all our baking-powder, our prunes, raisins, and dried  apples, most of our tobacco, a case of pilot bread, a sack full of  woollen socks and gloves, another sack full of photographic films--all  were burned. Most fortunately, the food provided especially for the  high-mountain work had not yet been taken to the cache, and our  pemmican, erbswurst, chocolate, compressed tea, and figs were safe. But  it was a great blow to us and involved considerable delay at a very  unfortunate time. We felt mortification at our carelessness as keenly as  we felt regret at our loss. The last thing a newcomer would dream of  would be danger from fire on a glacier, but we were not newcomers, and  we all knew how ever-present that danger is, more imminent in Alaska in  winter than in summer. Our carelessness had brought us nigh to the  ruining of the whole expedition. The loss of the films was especially  unfortunate, for we were thus reduced to Walter's small camera with a  common lens and the six or eight spools of film he had for it.    [Illustration: Hard work for dogs as well as men on the Muldrow  Glacier.]    [Sidenote: Camping Comfort]    The next day the final move of the main camp was made, and we  established ourselves in the cirque at the head of the Muldrow Glacier,  at an elevation of about eleven thousand five hundred feet, more than  half-way up the mountain. After digging a level place in the glacier and  setting up the tent, a wall of snow blocks was built all round it, and a  little house of snow blocks, a regular Eskimo igloo, was built near by  to serve as a cache. Some details of our camping may be of interest. The  damp from the glacier ice had incommoded us at previous camps, coming up  through skins and bedding when the tent grew warm. So at this camp we  took further precaution. The boxes in which our grub had been hauled  were broken up and laid over the whole portion of the floor of the tent  where our bed was; over this wooden floor a canvas cover was laid, and  upon this the sun-dried hides of the caribou and mountain-sheep we had  killed were placed. There was thus a dry bottom for our bedding, and we  were not much troubled thenceforward by the rising moisture, although a  camp upon the ice is naturally always a more or less sloppy place. The  hides were invaluable; heavy as they were, we carried them all the way  up.    So soon as we were thus securely lodged, elated when we thought of our  advance, but downcast when we recalled our losses, we set ourselves to  repair the damage of the fire so far as it was reparable. Walter and  Johnny must go all the way down to the base camp and bring up  sled-covers out of which to construct tents, must hunt the baggage  through for old socks and mitts, and must draw upon what grub had been  left for the return journey to the extreme limit it was safe to do so.    Karstens, accustomed to be clean-shaven, had been troubled since our  first glacier camp with an affection of the face which he attributed to  \"ingrowing whiskers,\" but when many hairs had been plucked out with the  tweezers and he was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse and the  inflammation spread to neck and temple, it was more correctly attributed  to an eczema, or tetter, caused by the glare of the sun. So he was not  loath to seclude himself for a few days in the tent while we set about  the making of socks and mitts from the camel's-hair lining of the  sleeping-bag. Walter's face was also very sore from the sun, his lips in  particular being swollen and blistered. So painful did they become that  I had to cut lip covers of surgeon's plaster to protect them. Then the  boys returned with the sorry gleanings of the base camp, and the  business of making two tents from the soiled and torn sled-covers and  darning worn-out socks and mittens, was put in hand. Our camp looked  like a sweat-shop those days, with its cross-legged tailormen and its  litter of snippets. In addition to the six-by-seven tent, three feet six  inches high, in which we were to live when we left the glacier, we made  a small, conical tent in which to read the instruments on the summit.  And all those days the sun shone in a clear sky!    [Sidenote: Amber Glasses]    Here, since reference has just been made to the effect of the sun's  glare on the face of one member of the party, it may be in place to  speak of the perfect eye protection which the amber snow-glasses  afforded us. Long experience with blue and smoke-colored glasses upon  the trail in spring had led us to expect much irritation of the eyes  despite the use of snow-glasses, and we had plentifully provided  ourselves with boracic acid and zinc sulphate for eye-washes. But the  amber glasses, with their yellow celluloid side-pieces, were not a mere  palliative, as all other glasses had been in our experience, but a  complete preventive of snow-blindness. No one of us had the slightest  trouble with the eyes, and the eye-washes were never used. It is hard  for any save men compelled every spring to travel over the dazzling  snows to realize what a great boon this newly discovered amber glass is.  There is no reason anywhere for any more snow-blindness, and there is no  use anywhere for"]]]
