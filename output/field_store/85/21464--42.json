[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32522"],[0,"Mr. Spaceship (#6)"],[1,"when he was fishing once on Terra, in Washington  State, fishing for bass. The fish were smart, going this way and  that--\"    \"Here's your cruiser,\" the other soldier said. \"Look!\"    An enormous vague shape was setting slowly down onto the field. They  could make nothing out but its row of tiny green blinkers. Kramer  stared at the shape.    \"Better hurry, sir,\" the soldiers said. \"They don't stick around here  very long.\"    \"Thanks.\" Kramer loped across the field, toward the black shape that  rose up above him, extended across the width of the field. The ramp  was down from the side of the cruiser and he caught hold of it. The  ramp rose, and a moment later Kramer was inside the hold of the ship.  The hatch slid shut behind him.    As he made his way up the stairs to the main deck the turbines roared  up from the moon, out into space.    Kramer opened the door to the main deck. He stopped suddenly, staring  around him in surprise. There was nobody in sight. The ship was  deserted.    \"Good God,\" he said. Realization swept over him, numbing him. He sat  down on a bench, his head swimming. \"Good God.\"    The ship roared out into space leaving the moon and Terra farther  behind each moment.    And there was nothing he could do.           *       *       *       *       *    \"So it was you who put the call through,\" he said at last. \"It was you  who called me on the vidphone, not any hospital on Terra. It was all  part of the plan.\" He looked up and around him. \"And Dolores is  really--\"    \"Your wife is fine,\" the wall speaker above him said tonelessly. \"It  was a fraud. I am sorry to trick you that way, Philip, but it was all  I could think of. Another day and you would have been back on Terra. I  don't want to remain in this area any longer than necessary. They have  been so certain of finding me out in deep space that I have been able  to stay here without too much danger. But even the purloined letter  was found eventually.\"    Kramer smoked his cigarette nervously. \"What are you going to do?  Where are we going?\"    \"First, I want to talk to you. I have many things to discuss. I was  very disappointed when you left me, along with the others. I had hoped  that you would remain.\" The dry voice chuckled. \"Remember how we used  to talk in the old days, you and I? That was a long time ago.\"    The ship was gaining speed. It plunged through space at tremendous  speed, rushing through the last of the defense zone and out beyond. A  rush of nausea made Kramer bend over for a moment.    When he straightened up the voice from the wall went on, \"I'm sorry to  step it up so quickly, but we are still in danger. Another few moments  and we'll be free.\"    \"How about yuk ships? Aren't they out here?\"    \"I've already slipped away from several of them. They're quite curious  about me.\"    \"Curious?\"    \"They sense that I'm different, more like their own organic mines.  They don't like it. I believe they will begin to withdraw from this  area, soon. Apparently they don't want to get involved with me.  They're an odd race, Philip. I would have liked to study them closely,  try to learn something about them. I'm of the opinion that they use no  inert material. All their equipment and instruments are alive, in some  form or other. They don't construct or build at all. The idea of  _making_ is foreign to them. They utilize existing forms. Even their  ships--\"    \"Where are we going?\" Kramer said. \"I want to know where you are  taking me.\"    \"Frankly, I'm not certain.\"    \"You're not certain?\"    \"I haven't worked some details out. There are a few vague spots in my  program, still. But I think that in a short while I'll have them  ironed out.\"    \"What is your program?\" Kramer said.    \"It's really very simple. But don't you want to come into the control  room and sit? The seats are much more comfortable than that metal  bench.\"    Kramer went into the control room and sat down at the control board.  Looking at the useless apparatus made him feel strange.    \"What's the matter?\" the speaker above the board rasped.           *       *       *       *       *    Kramer gestured helplessly. \"I'm--powerless. I can't do anything. And  I don't like it. Do you blame me?\"    \"No. No, I don't blame you. But you'll get your control back, soon.  Don't worry. This is only a temporary expedient, taking you off this  way. It was something I didn't contemplate. I forgot that orders would  be given out to shoot me on sight.\"    \"It was Gross' idea.\"    \"I don't doubt that. My conception, my plan, came to me as soon as you  began to describe your project, that day at my house. I saw at once  that you were wrong; you people have no understanding of the mind at  all. I realized that the transfer of a human brain from an organic  body to a complex artificial space ship would not involve the loss of  the intellectualization faculty of the mind. When a man thinks, he  _is_.    \"When I realized that, I saw the possibility of an age-old dream  becoming real. I was quite elderly when I first met you, Philip. Even  then my life-span had come pretty much to its end. I could look ahead  to nothing but death, and with it the extinction of all my ideas. I  had made no mark on the world, none at all. My students, one by one,  passed from me into the world, to take up jobs in the great Research  Project, the search for better and bigger weapons of war.    \"The world has been fighting for a long time, first with itself, then  with the Martians, then with these beings from Proxima Centauri, whom  we know nothing about. The human society has evolved war as a cultural  institution, like the science of astronomy, or mathematics. War is a  part of our lives, a career, a respected vocation. Bright, alert young  men and women move into it, putting their shoulders to the wheel as  they did in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. It has always been so.    \"But is it innate in mankind? I don't think so. No social custom is  innate. There were many human groups that did not go to war; the  Eskimos never grasped the idea at all, and the American Indians never  took to it well.    \"But these dissenters were wiped out, and a cultural pattern was  established that became the standard for the whole planet. Now it has  become ingrained in us.    \"But if someplace along the line some other way of settling problems  had arisen and taken hold, something different than the massing of men  and material to--\"    \"What's your plan?\" Kramer said. \"I know the theory. It was part of  one of your lectures.\"    \"Yes, buried in a lecture on plant selection, as I recall. When you  came to me with this proposition I realized that perhaps my conception  could be brought to life, after all. If my theory were right that war  is only a habit, not an instinct, a society built up apart from Terra  with a minimum of cultural roots might develop differently. If it  failed to absorb our outlook, if it could start out on another foot,  it might not arrive at the same point to which we have come: a dead  end, with nothing but greater and greater wars in sight, until nothing  is left but ruin and destruction everywhere.    \"Of course, there would have to be a Watcher to guide the experiment,  at first. A crisis would undoubtedly come very quickly, probably in  the second generation. Cain would arise almost at once.    \"You see, Kramer, I estimate that if I remain at rest most of the  time, on some small planet or moon, I may be able to keep functioning  for almost a hundred years. That would be time enough, sufficient to  see the direction of the new colony. After that--Well, after that it  would be up to the colony itself.    \"Which is just as well, of course. Man must take control eventually,  on his own. One hundred years, and after that they will have control  of their own destiny. Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps war is more than a  habit. Perhaps it is a law of the universe, that things can only  survive as groups by group violence.    \"But I'm going ahead and taking the chance that it is only a habit,  that I'm right, that war is something we're so accustomed to that we  don't realize it is a very unnatural thing. Now as to the place! I'm  still a little vague about that. We must find the place, still.    \"That's what we're doing now. You and I are going to inspect a few  systems off the beaten path, planets where the trading prospects are  low enough to keep Terran ships away. I know of one planet that might  be a good place. It was reported by the Fairchild Expedition in their  original manual. We may look into that, for a start.\"    The ship was silent.           *       *       *       *       *    Kramer sat for a time, staring down at the metal floor under him. The  floor throbbed dully with the motion of the turbines. At last he  looked up.    \"You might be right. Maybe our outlook is only a habit.\" Kramer got to  his feet. \"But I wonder if something has occurred to you?\"    \"What is that?\"    \"If it's such a deeply ingrained habit, going back thousands of years,  how are you going to get your colonists to make the break, leave Terra  and Terran customs? How about _this_ generation, the first ones, the  people who found the colony? I think you're right that the next  generation would be free of all this, if there were an--\" He grinned.  \"--An Old Man Above to teach them something else instead.\"    Kramer looked up at the wall speaker. \"How are you going to get the  people to leave Terra and come with you, if by your own theory, this  generation can't be saved, it all has to start with the next?\"    The wall speaker was silent. Then it made a sound, the faint dry  chuckle.    \"I'm surprised at you, Philip. Settlers can be found. We won't need  many, just a few.\" The speaker chuckled again. \"I'll acquaint you with  my solution.\"    At the far end of the corridor a door slid open. There was sound, a  hesitant sound. Kramer turned.    \"Dolores!\"    Dolores Kramer stood uncertainly, looking into the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D. (#6)"],[1,"glass, but  apparently saw nothing.    \"We had better scatter, at that,\" he said finally. \"It's orders, you  know. See!\" He pointed to the valley.    Here and there a tiny human figure shot for a moment above the foliage  of the treetops.    \"That's bad,\" Wilma commented, as she counted the jumpers. \"No less than  fifteen people visible, and all clearly radiating from a central point.  Do they want to give away our location?\"    The standard orders covering air raids were that the population was to  scatter individually. There should be no grouping, or even pairing, in  view of the destructiveness of the disintegrator rays. Experience of  generations had proved that if this were done, and everybody remained  hidden beneath the tree screens, the Hans would have to sweep mile after  mile of territory, foot by foot, to catch more than a small percentage  of the community.    Gerdi, however, refused to leave Bill, and Wilma developed an equal  obstinacy against quitting my side. I was inexperienced at this sort of  thing, she explained, quite ignoring the fact that she was too; she was  only thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the last air raid.    However, since I could not argue her out of it, we leaped together about  a quarter of a mile to the right, while Bill and Gerdi disappeared down  the hillside among the trees.    Wilma and I both wanted a point of vantage from which we might overlook  the valley and the sky to the north, and we found it near the top of the  ridge, where, protected from visibility by thick branches, we could look  out between the tree trunks, and get a good view of the valley.    No more rockets went up. Except for a few of those warning red clouds,  drifting lazily in a blue sky, there was no visible indication of man's  past or present existence anywhere in the sky or on the ground.    Then Wilma gripped my arm and pointed. I saw it; away off in the  distance; looking like a phantom dirigible airship, in its coat of  low-visibility paint, a bare spectre.    \"Seven thousand feet up,\" Wilma whispered, crouching close to me.  \"Watch.\"    The ship was about the same shape as the great dirigibles of the 20th  Century that I had seen, but without the suspended control car, engines,  propellors, rudders or elevating planes. As it loomed rapidly nearer, I  saw that it was wider and somewhat flatter than I had supposed.    Now I could see the repellor rays that held the ship aloft, like  searchlight beams faintly visible in the bright daylight (and still  faintly visible to the human eye at night). Actually, I had been  informed by my instructors, there were two rays; the visible one  generated by the ship's apparatus, and directed toward the ground as a  beam of \"carrier\" impulses; and the true repellor ray, the complement of  the other in one sense, induced by the action of the \"carrier\" and  reacting in a concentrating upward direction from the mass of the earth,  becoming successively electronic, atomic and finally molecular, in its  nature, according to various ratios of distance between earth mass and  \"carrier\" source, until, in the last analysis, the ship itself actually  is supported on an upward rushing column of air, much like a ball  continuously supported on a fountain jet.    The raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays were both slanted  astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with tremendous  momentum.    The ship was operating two disintegrator rays, though only in a casual,  intermittent fashion. But whenever they flashed downward with blinding  brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted instantaneously into  nothing, where they played upon them.    When later I inspected the scars left by these rays I found them some  five feet deep and thirty feet wide, the exposed surfaces being  lava-like in texture, but of a pale, iridescent, greenish hue.    No systematic use of the rays was made by the ship, however, until it  reached a point over the center of the valley--the center of the  community's activities. There it came to a sudden stop by shooting its  repellor beams sharply forward and easing them back gradually to the  vertical, holding the ship floating and motionless. Then the work of  destruction began systematically.    Back and forth traveled the destroying rays, ploughing parallel furrows  from hillside to hillside. We gasped in dismay, Wilma and I, as time  after time we saw it plough through sections where we knew camps or  plants were located.    \"This is awful,\" she moaned, a terrified question in her eyes. \"How  could they know the location so exactly, Tony? Did you see? They were  never in doubt. They stalled at a predetermined spot--and--and it was  exactly the right spot.\"    We did not talk of what might happen if the rays were turned in our  direction. We both knew. We would simply disintegrate in a split second  into mere scattered electronic vibrations. Strangely enough, it was this  self-reliant girl of the 25th Century, who clung to me, a relatively  primitive man of the 20th, less familiar than she with the thought of  this terrifying possibility, for moral support.    We knew that many of our companions must have been whisked into absolute  non-existence before our eyes in these few moments. The whole thing  paralyzed us into mental and physical immobility for I do not know how  long.    It couldn't have been long, however, for the rays had not ploughed more  than thirty of their twenty-foot furrows or so across the valley, when I  regained control of myself, and brought Wilma to herself by shaking her  roughly.    \"How far will this rocket gun shoot, Wilma?\" I demanded, drawing my  pistol.    \"It depends on your rocket, Tony. It will take even the longest range  rocket, but you could shoot more accurately from a longer tube. But why?  You couldn't penetrate the shell of that ship with rocket force, even if  you could reach it.\"    I fumbled clumsily with my rocket pouch, for I was excited. I had an  idea I wanted to try; a \"hunch\" I called it, forgetting that Wilma could  not understand my ancient slang. But finally, with her help, I selected  the longest range explosive rocket in my pouch, and fitted it to my  pistol.    \"It won't carry seven thousand feet, Tony,\" Wilma objected. But I took  aim carefully. It was another thought that I had in my mind. The  supporting repellor ray, I had been told, became molecular in character  at what was called a logarithmic level of five (below that it was a  purely electronic \"flow\" or pulsation between the source of the  \"carrier\" and the average mass of the earth). Below that level if I  could project my explosive bullet into this stream where it began to  carry material substance upward, might it not rise with the air column,  gathering speed and hitting the ship with enough impact to carry it  through the shell? It was worth trying anyhow. Wilma became greatly  excited, too, when she grasped the nature of my inspiration.    Feverishly I looked around for some formation of branches against which  I could rest the pistol, for I had to aim most carefully. At last I  found one. Patiently I sighted on the hulk of the ship far above us,  aiming at the far side of it, at such an angle as would, so far as I  could estimate, bring my bullet path through the forward repellor beam.  At last the sights wavered across the point I sought and I pressed the  button gently.    For a moment we gazed breathlessly.    Suddenly the ship swung bow down, as on a pivot, and swayed like a  pendulum. Wilma screamed in her excitement.    \"Oh, Tony, you hit it! You hit it! Do it again; bring it down!\"    We had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and we dropped  it three times in our excitement in inserting it in my gun. Then,  forcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while Wilma stuffed her  little fist into her mouth to keep from shrieking, I sighted carefully  again and fired. In a flash, Wilma had grasped the hope that this  discovery of mine might lead to the end of the Han domination.    The elapsed time of the rocket's invisible flight seemed an age.    Then we saw the ship falling. It seemed to plunge lazily, but actually  it fell with terrific acceleration, turning end over end, its  disintegrator rays, out of control, describing vast, wild arcs, and once  cutting a gash through the forest less than two hundred feet from where  we stood.    The crash with which the heavy craft hit the ground reverberated from  the hills--the momentum of eighteen or twenty thousand tons, in a sheer  drop of seven thousand feet. A mangled mass of metal, it buried itself  in the ground, with poetic justice, in the middle of the smoking,  semi-molten field of destruction it had been so deliberately ploughing.    The silence, the vacuity of the landscape, was oppressive, as the last  echoes died away.    Then far down the hillside, a single figure leaped exultantly above the  foliage screen. And in the distance another, and another.    In a moment the sky was punctured by signal rockets. One after another  the little red puffs became drifting clouds.    \"Scatter! Scatter!\" Wilma exclaimed. \"In half an hour there'll be an  entire Han fleet here from Nu-yok, and another from Bah-flo. They'll get  this instantly on their recordographs and location finders. They'll  blast the whole valley and the country for miles beyond. Come, Tony.  There's no time for the gang to rally. See the signals. We've got to  jump. Oh, I'm so proud of you!\"    Over the ridge we went, in long leaps toward the east, the country of  the Delawares.    From time to time signal rockets puffed in the sky. Most of them were  the \"red warnings,\" the \"scatter\" signals. But from certain of the  others, which Wilma identified as Wyoming rockets, she gathered that  whoever was in command (we did not know whether the Boss was alive or  not) was ordering an ultimate rally toward the south, and so we changed  our course.    It was a great"]]]
