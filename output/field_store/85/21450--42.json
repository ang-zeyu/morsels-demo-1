He glared back with right good  will. \"How come you gentlemen are still with us?\" he inquired. \"One  would have thought you would have perished of pure sensibility long  since, then.\"    \"It's not nice to talk that way,\" the chief petty officer burst out,  \"not with him lying there not yet cold.... Ah,\" he heaved a long sigh,  \"we'll never see his like again.\"    \"Ay, that we won't,\" agreed the crew, huddled in the corridor outside  the captain's cabin.    Iversen sincerely hoped not, but he forbore to speak.           *       *       *       *       *    Since Bridey had reached the ultimate point in his life cycle, it seemed  certain that he was not going to change into anything else and so he was  given a spaceman's burial. Feeling like a put-upon fool, Captain Iversen  read a short prayer as Bridey's slight body was consigned to the vast  emptiness of space.    Then the airlock clanged shut behind the last mortal remains of the  ill-fated extraterrestrial and that was the end of it.    But the funereal atmosphere did not diminish as the ship forged on  toward Earth. Gloomy days passed, one after the other, during which no  one spoke, save to issue or dispute an order. Looking at himself one day  in the mirror on his cabin wall, the captain realized that he was  getting old. Perhaps he ought to retire instead of still dreaming of a  new command and a new crew.    And then one day, as he sat in his cabin reading the Spaceman's Credo,  the lights on the _Herringbone_ went out, all at once, while the  constant hum of the motors died down slowly, leaving a strange,  uncomfortable silence. Iversen found himself suspended weightless in the  dark, for the gravity, of course, had gone off with the power. What, he  wondered, had come to pass? He often found himself thinking in such  terms these days.    Hoarse cries issued from the passageway outside; then he heard a squeak  as his cabin door opened and persons unknown floated inside, breathing  heavily.    \"The power has failed, sir!\" gasped the first officer's voice.    \"That has not escaped my notice,\" Iversen said icily. Were not even his  last moments to be free from persecution?    \"It's all that maniac Smullyan's fault. He stored his _mk'oog_ in the  fuel tanks. After emptying them out first, that is. We're out of fuel.\"    The captain put a finger in his book to mark his place, which was, he  knew with a kind of supernal detachment, rather foolish, because there  was no prospect of there ever being lights to read by again.    \"Put him in irons, if you can find him,\" he ordered. \"And tell the men  to prepare themselves gracefully for a lingering death.\"    Iversen could hear a faint creak as the first officer drew himself to  attention in the darkness. \"The men of the _Herringbone_, sir,\" he said,  stiffly, \"are always prepared for calamity.\"    \"Ay, that we are,\" agreed various voices.    So they were all there, were they? Well, it was too much to expect that  they would leave him in death any more than they had in life.    \"It is well,\" Iversen said. \"It is well,\" he repeated, unable to think  of anything more fitting.    Suddenly the lights went on again and the ship gave a leap. From his  sprawling position on the floor, amid his recumbent officers, Iversen  could hear the hum of motors galvanized into life.    \"But if the fuel tanks are empty,\" he asked of no one in particular,  \"where did the power come from?\"    \"I am the power,\" said a vast, deep voice that filled the ship from hold  to hold.    \"And the glory,\" said the radio operator reverently. \"Don't forget the  glory.\"    \"No,\" the voice replied and it was the voice of Bridey, resonant with  all the amplitude of the immense chest cavity he had acquired. \"Not the  glory, merely the power. I have reached a higher plane of existence. I  am a spaceship.\"    \"Praise be to the Ultimate Nothingness!\" Harkaway cried.    \"Ultimate Nothingness, nothing!\" Bridey said impatiently. \"I achieved it  all myself.\"    \"Then that's how the Flimbotzi spaceships were powered!\" Iversen  exclaimed. \"By themselves--the Flimbotzik themselves, I mean--\"    \"Even so,\" Bridey replied grandly. \"And this lofty form of life happens  to be one which we poor humans cannot reach unassisted. Someone has to  build the shell for us to occupy, which is the reason humans dwell  together in fellowship and harmony--\"    \"You purposely got Harkaway to take you aboard the _Herringbone_,\"  Iversen interrupted wrathfully. \"You--you stowaway!\"    Bridey's laugh rang through the ship, setting the loose parts quivering.  \"Of course. When first I set eyes upon this vessel of yours, I saw  before me the epitome of all dreams. Never had any of our kind so  splendid an encasement. And, upon determining that the vessel was, as  yet, a soulless thing, I got myself aboard; I was born, I died, and was  reborn again with the greatest swiftness consonant with comfort, so that  I could awaken in this magnificent form. Oh, joy, joy, joy!\"    \"You know,\" Iversen said, \"now that I hear one of you talk at length, I  really can't blame Harkaway for his typically imbecilic mistake.\"    \"We are a wordy species,\" Bridey conceded.    \"You had no right to do what you did,\" Iversen told him, \"no right to  take over--\"    \"But I didn't take over,\" Bridey the _Herringbone_ said complacently. \"I  merely remained quiescent and content in the knowledge of my power until  yours failed. Without me, you would even now be spinning in the vasty  voids, a chrome-trimmed sepulcher. Now, three times as swiftly as  before, shall I bear you back to the planet you very naively call home.\"    \"Not three times as fast, please!\" Iversen was quick to plead. \"The ship  isn't built--_we're_ not built to stand such speeds.\"    The ship sighed. \"Disappointment needs must come to all--the high, the  low, the man, the spaceship. It must be borne--\" the voice  broke--\"bravely. Somehow.\"    \"What am I going to do?\" Iversen asked, turning to the first officer for  advice for the first time ever. \"I was planning to ask for a transfer or  resign my command when we got back to Earth. But how can I leave Bridey  in the hands of the IEE(E)?\"    \"You can't, sir,\" the first officer said. \"Neither can we.\"    \"If you explain,\" Harkaway offered timidly, \"perhaps they'll present the  ship to the government.\"    Both Iversen and the first officer snorted, united for once. \"Not the  IEE(E),\" Iversen said. \"They'd--they'd exhibit it or something and  charge admission.\"    \"Oh, no,\" Bridey cried, \"I don't want to be exhibited! I want to sail  through the trackless paths of space. What good is a body like this if I  cannot use it to its fullest?\"    \"Have no fear,\" Iversen assured it. \"We'll just--\" he shrugged, his  dreams of escape forever blighted--\"just have to buy the ship from the  IEE(E), that's all.\"    \"Right you are, sir,\" the first officer agreed. \"We must club together,  every man Jack of us, and buy her. Him. It. That's the only decent thing  to do.\"    \"Perhaps they won't sell,\" Harkaway worried. \"Maybe--\"    \"Oh, they'll sell, all right,\" Iversen said wearily. \"They'd sell the  chairman of the board, if you made them an offer, and throw in all the  directors if the price was right.\"    \"And then what will we do?\" the first officer asked. \"Once the ship has  been purchased, what will our course be? What, in other words, are we to  do?\"    It was Bridey who answered. \"We will speed through space seeking,  learning, searching, until you--all of you--pass on to higher planes  and, leaving the frail shells you now inhabit, occupy proud, splendid  vessels like the one I wear now. Then, a vast transcendent flotilla, we  will seek other universes....\"    \"But we don't become spaceships,\" Iversen said unhappily. \"We don't  become anything.\"    \"How do you know we don't?\" Smullyan demanded, appearing on the  threshold. \"How do you know what we become? Build thee more stately  spaceships, O my soul!\"    Above all else, Iversen was a space officer and dereliction of duty  could not be condoned even in exceptional circumstances. \"Put him in  irons, somebody!\"    \"Ask Bridey why there were only forty-five spaceships on his planet!\"  the doctor yelled over his shoulder as he was dragged off. \"Ask where  the others went--where they are now.\"    But Bridey wouldn't answer that question."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#6)"],[1,"become vastly lessened. Think of it! So many  of the inhabitants of our prisons, asylums, and our poor-houses, are  composed of men and women who have offended against nature's laws by  violating their own sexual nature. Add to this summary the list of  broken-hearted, deflowered virgins and unwedded mothers, and you have  the picture complete.    What a contrast with that manliness of character from which he has  fallen! Now he is in an insane condition, blaming everyone for having  contributed to his many misfortunes and his fallen condition, whereas he  alone is the culprit. No one made him commit the first or any subsequent  evil. He allowed his own mind to yield to the first temptation, and then  went on from step to step, he alone being responsible for the result  Yield not the first point, and all is safe.    The pride of perfect adolescence, as described a few pages back, is due  to purity of thought, to chastity and continence. This purity shines  through every tissue, enkindles the eye with a true expression, makes  bright the countenance and erects the form. It gives elasticity to the  step, causes harmony in the tones of the voice, and adds dignity to the  carriage and deportment. The first step in the paths of vice in any  form, whether in sexual errors or any other, detracts in the exact  degree of the digression from all of the above beautiful and ennobling  characteristics.    We have spoken in the preceding pages of new feelings and desires being  awakened in the youth after his fourteenth year. This change is wholly  due to his approaching manhood, to the time when he will be fully  prepared to appreciate, to love and protect, guide and support her whom  he makes his wife, and to become the father of happy and healthy  children. But this approach to manhood is not due to the development of  the genital organs, as some writers affirm, for this would be a  reversion of orderly development. The approaching manhood develops in  full accordance to their uses and importance _all_ the organs belonging  to man. As the well-developed infant has all its organs developed in a  condition suitable for its state, and the child has all its organs in  all parts of the body, developed in full accord with its state, so  adolescence follows, and every organ must develop accordingly; and in  this development a new impetus is given to every organ in the body. The  whole man awakens to a newness of life as is seen in the change of his  voice, the spreading out of his frame, the independence and command of  his bearing, the activity of his brain, the soundness of his judgment,  until he becomes in the fullest sense a rational being. Of course the  development of his genital organs keeps pace with that of his brain; but  the brain should lead the way throughout the entire development of the  human race.    At the time of puberty, then, a new and a different sensation springs up  in the generative organs, which is in perfect harmony with the uses for  which they are intended. We recognize the use of the hands, the fingers,  the feet, the eyes, the ears, the sense of taste, &c., and we use them  accordingly. We should think of the generative organs only in the same  light. They are intended for use, for the highest and holiest use of  procreating human beings to the end that they may become angels in  heaven. These organs were not made to be abused; but they are abused  every time the mind is allowed to dwell upon them improperly. Every  excitation we allow from lewd thoughts or fancies, has a debasing and  deteriorating effect upon that well-developed form, upon that conscience  so free, and upon that countenance so open and bright, which has been  described in the preceding pages.    If the mere thought and excitation arising therefrom are injurious to  the perfection of the youth, how much more injurious must be the  ultimation of that thought in masturbation, in unlawful sexual  intercourse, or in the loss of seminal fluid by other unnatural means.    Right here I feel impelled to say something of the                      DIFFICULTY OF MAINTAINING CHASTITY.    I, in connection with many of our best and wisest men who have given  the subject a lifetime's most earnest consideration, hold that for a  young man whose early education has been carefully looked to, and  consequently, whose mind has not been debased by vile practices, it is  no more impossible mentally, or injurious physically, to preserve his  chastity than to refrain from yielding to any other of the innumerable  temptations with which his life is beset. And every year of voluntary  chastity renders the task easier by mere force of habit. I wish to be  clearly understood in this matter.    So long as a young man remains chaste in thought and deed, he will not  suffer any bad effects from his continence. It is the _semicontinent_,  the man who knows the right but pursues the wrong, who suffers! Patients  frequently complain that enforced continence makes them restless,  irritable, unfit for mental application of any sort, &c. Sexual  intercourse is then indulged in, and presto: for the time being, what a  welcome change. The now unclogged mind grasps with vigor any subject  presented to it, the spirits are exuberant and the physical frame  buoyant. But, is the trouble cured, is it permanently eradicated from  the system? No! In a short time the symptoms reappear and the same  remedy is again sought. The more the sexual feelings are indulged the  more frequent will be their recurrence, and the result need not be  written; every candid mind can easily see it. To their shame and  confusion be it said, there are many physicians who, when consulted by  their patients for medical assistance in such trials, \"deliberately  encourage the early indulgence of the passions, on the false and wicked  ground that self-restraint is incompatible with health. What abhorrence  can be too deep for a doctrine so destructive, or for the teachers who  thus, before the eyes of those whose youthful ignorance, whose sore  natural temptation, rather call for the wisest and tenderest guidance  and encouragement, put darkness for light, evil for good, and bitter for  sweet.\"[E]      [E] Wm. Acton, M. R. C. S.    I declare emphatically that no symptoms of sexual suffering, no matter  how feelingly described or cunningly insinuated, should ever lead a  physician to prescribe for a young man that fatal remedy, illicit  intercourse. Medically as a physician, morally as a Christian, and  sympathizingly as a fellow being, I record a solemn protest against such  false treatment. It is better for a youth to live a continent life. The  strictly chaste suffer comparatively little sexual irritability; but the  incontinent, at recurring periods are sure to be troubled in one or  other of the ways spoken of; and the remedy of indulgence, if effective,  requires repetition as often as the inconvenience returns. No! When thus  consulted, let the physician prescribe the proper medicament, if one be  necessary; and let him direct a plain, nourishing, non-stimulating diet,  physical exertion of any kind carried to exhaustion, and SELF CONTROL.    Would any young man in his senses listen to a physician, who, for  lowness of spirits, mental despondency, &c., should tell him to drink  plentifully of brandy or eat hasheesh? On the same principle then let a  youth shun the physician, who, for sexual excitement, prescribes sexual  indulgence.    Again, such complaints coming from young men are very often specious,  and are mere subterfuges--overdrawn pictures of their sufferings--which  are presented as an excuse for indulging the sensual emotions, instead  of manfully and righteously struggling to overcome them. And further,  \"if anyone wishes to really experience the acutest sexual suffering, he  can adopt no more certain method than to be incontinent with the  intention of becoming continent again, when he has 'sown his wild oats.'  The agony of breaking off a habit which so rapidly entwines itself with  every fibre of the human frame (as sexual indulgence) is such that it  would not be too much to say in the Wise Man's words, '_None_ that go to  her return again, neither take they hold on the paths of life.'\"        \"The sin, of all, most sure to blight--       The sin, of all, that the soul's light         Is soonest lost, extinguished in.\"    Remember then that sexual suffering comes to the _incontinent_ man, and  that it is far easier, even for the fully developed vigorous adult, to  continue in control of these feelings, than when they have been once  excited and indulged.    One single impure connection may entail a whole life of syphilitic  suffering on the unhappy transgressor. Would this \"pay?\"    No inducement could persuade me to assume the awful responsibilities of  advising illicit intercourse. Apart from Christian principle, I know  that there is no necessity, physiological, pathological or any other,  that can excuse any physician for saying that the Seventh Commandment  may ever be broken. My sentiments on the physiological side of the  question are so admirably expressed by Acton,[F] that I will here quote  from him.      [F] Fourth American Edition, P. 97.    \"One argument in favor of incontinence deserves special notice, as it  purports to be founded on physiology. I have been consulted by persons  who feared, or professed to fear, that if the organs were not exercised  regularly, they would become atrophied, or that in some way impotence  might be the result of chastity. This is the assigned reason for  committing fornication. There exists _no greater_ error than this, or  one more opposed to physiological truth. In the first place, I may state  that I have, after many years' experience, never seen a single instance  of atrophy of the generative organs from this cause. I have, it is true,  met with the complaint--but in what class of cases does it occur? It  arises in all"]]]
