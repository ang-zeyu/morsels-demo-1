Old Man Above ran very quickly.  Wherever he set his foot the snow melted. The snow melted very quickly  and made streams of water. Now Grizzlies stood in line to welcome Old  Man Above. They stood on two feet and carried clubs. Then Old Man Above  saw his daughter and her children. He saw the new race of men. Then Old  Man Above became very angry. He said to Grizzlies:    \"Never speak again. Be silent. Neither shall ye stand upright. Ye shall  use your hands as feet. Ye shall look downward.\"    Then Old Man Above put out the fire in the tepee. Smoke no longer curls  from the smoke hole. He fastened the door of the tepee. The new race of  men he drove out. Then Old Man Above took Little Daughter back to his  tepee.    That is why grizzlies walk on four feet and look downward. Only when  fighting they stand on two feet and use their fists like men.          The Creation of Man-Kind and the Flood  Pima (Arizona)    After the world was ready, Earth Doctor made all kinds of animals and  creeping things. Then he made images of clay, and told them to be  people. After a while there were so many people that there was not food  and water enough for all. They were never sick and none died. At last  there grew to be so many they were obliged to eat each other. Then Earth  Doctor, because he could not give them food and water enough, killed  them all. He caught the hook of his staff into the sky and pulled it  down so that it crushed all the people and all the animals, until there  was nothing living on the earth. Earth Doctor made a hole through the  earth with his stick, and through that he went, coming out safe, but  alone, on the other side.    He called upon the sun and moon to come out of the wreck of the world  and sky, and they did so. But there was no sky for them to travel  through, no stars, and no Milky Way. So Earth Doctor made these all over  again. Then he created another race of men and animals.    Then Coyote was born. Moon was his mother. When Coyote was large and  strong he came to the land where the Pima Indians lived.    Then Elder Brother was born. Earth was his mother, and Sky his father.  He was so powerful that he spoke roughly to Earth Doctor, who trembled  before him. The people began to increase in numbers, just as they had  done before, but Elder Brother shortened their lives, so the earth did  not become so crowded. But Elder Brother did not like the people created  by Earth Doctor, so he planned to destroy them again. So Elder Brother  planned to create a magic baby....    The screams of the baby shook the earth. They could be heard for a great  distance. Then Earth Doctor called all the people together, and told  them there would be a great flood. He sang a magic song and then bored a  hole through the flat earth-plain through to the other side. Some of the  people went into the hole to escape the flood that was coming, but not  very many got through. Some of the people asked Elder Brother to help  them, but he did not answer. Only Coyote he answered. He told Coyote to  find a big log and sit on it, so that he would float on the surface of  the water with the driftwood. Elder Brother got into a big olla which he  had made, and closed it tight. So he rolled along on the ground under  the olla. He sang a magic song as he climbed into his olla.    A young man went to the place where the baby was screaming. Its tears  were a great torrent which cut gorges in the earth before it. The water  was rising all over the earth. He bent over the child to pick it up, and  immediately both became birds and flew above the flood. Only five birds  were saved from the flood. One was a flicker and one a vulture. They  clung by their beaks to the sky to keep themselves above the waters, but  the tail of the flicker was washed by the waves and that is why it is  stiff to this day. At last a god took pity on them and gave them power  to make \"nests of down\" from their own breasts on which they floated on  the water. One of these birds was the vipisimal, and if any one injures  it to this day, the flood may come again.    Now South Doctor called his people to him and told them that a flood was  coming. He sang a magic song and he bored a hole in the ground with a  cane so that people might go through to the other side. Others he sent  to Earth Doctor, but Earth Doctor told them they were too late. So they  sent the people to the top of a high mountain called Crooked Mountain.  South Doctor sang a magic song and traced his cane around the mountain,  but that held back the waters only for a short time. Four times he sang  and traced a line around the mountain, yet the flood rose again each  time. There was only one thing more to do.    He held his magic crystals in his left hand and sang a song. Then he  struck it with his cane. A thunder peal rang through the mountains. He  threw his staff into the water and it cracked with a loud noise.  Turning, he saw a dog near him. He said, \"How high is the tide?\" The dog  said, \"It is very near the top.\" He looked at the people as he said it.  When they heard his voice they all turned to stone. They stood just as  they were, and they are there to this day in groups: some of the men  talking, some of the women cooking, and some crying.    But Earth Doctor escaped by enclosing himself in his reed staff, which  floated upon the water. Elder Brother rolled along in his olla until he  came near the mouth of the Colorado River. The olla is now called Black  Mountain. After the flood he came out and visited all parts of the land.    When he met Coyote and Earth Doctor, each claimed to have been the first  to appear after the flood, but at last they admitted Elder Brother was  the first, so he became ruler of the world.          The Birds and the Flood  Pima (Arizona)    Once upon a time, when all the earth was flooded, two birds were hanging  above the water. They were clinging to the sky with their beaks. The  larger bird was gray with a long tail and beak, but the smaller one was  the tiny bird that builds a nest shaped like an olla, with only a very  small opening at the top. The birds were tired and frightened. The  larger one cried and cried, but the little bird held on tight and said,  \"Don't cry. I 'm littler than you are, but I 'm very brave.\"          Legend of the Flood  Ashochimi (Coast Indians, Cal.)    Long ago there was a great flood which destroyed all the people in the  world. Only Coyote was saved. When the waters subsided, the earth was  empty. Coyote thought about it a long time.    Then Coyote collected a great bundle of tail feathers from owls, hawks,  eagles, and buzzards. He journeyed over the whole earth and carefully  located the site of each Indian village. Where the tepees had stood, he  planted a feather in the ground and scraped up the dirt around it. The  feathers sprouted like trees, and grew up and branched. At last they  turned into men and women. So the world was inhabited with people again.          The Great Flood  Sia (New Mexico)    For a long time after the fight, the people were very happy, but the  ninth year was very bad. The whole earth was filled with water. The  water did not fall in rain, but came in as rivers between the mesas. It  continued to flow in from all sides until the people and the animals  fled to the mesa tops. The water continued to rise until nearly level  with the tops of the mesas. Then Sussistinnako cried, \"Where shall my  people go? Where is the road to the north?\" He looked to the north.  \"Where is the road to the west? Where is the road to the east? Where is  the road to the south?\" He looked in each direction. He said, \"I see the  waters are everywhere.\"    All of the medicine men sang four days and four nights, but still the  waters continued to rise.    Then Spider placed a huge reed upon the top of the mesa. He said, \"My  people will pass up through this to the world above.\"    Utset led the way, carrying a sack in which were many of the Star  people. The medicine men followed, carrying sacred things in sacred  blankets on their backs. Then came the people, and the animals, and the  snakes, and birds. The turkey was far behind and the foam of the water  rose and reached the tip ends of his feathers. You may know that is true  because even to this day they bear the mark of the waters.    When they reached the top of the great reed, the earth which formed the  floor of the world above, barred their way. Utset called to Locust,  \"Man, come here.\" Locust went to her. She said, \"You know best how to  pass through the earth. Go and make a door for us.\"    \"Very well, mother,\" said Locust. \"I think I can make a way.\"    He began working with his feet and after a while he passed through the  earthy floor, entering the upper world. As soon as he saw it, he said to  Utset, \"It is good above.\"    Utset called Badger, and said, \"Make a door for us. Sika, the Locust has  made one, but it is very small.\"    \"Very well, mother, I will,\" said Badger.    After much work he passed into the world above, and said,    \"Mother, I have opened the way.\" Badger also said, \"Father-mother, the  world above is good.\"    Utset then called Deer. She said, \"You go through first. If you can get  your head through, others may pass.\"    The deer returned saying, \"Father, it is all right. I passed without  trouble.\"    Utset called Elk. She said, \"You pass through. If you can get your head  and horns through the door, all may pass.\"    Elk returned saying, \"Father, it is good. I passed without trouble.\"    Then Utset told the buffalo to try, and he returned saying,  \"Father-mother, the door is good. I passed without trouble.\"    Utset called the scarab beetle and gave him the sack of stars, telling  him to pass out first with them. Scarab did not know what the sack  contained, but he was very small and grew tired carrying it. He wondered  what could be in the sack.

The Library Committee, which had for some  years taken a less important role in the control of the Library, once  again came to the fore. It was instrumental in obtaining much needed  space and assisting generally in the progress which took place.    Mr Wauchop was also responsible for obtaining the microfilm camera  which is today reducing the bulk of New Zealand newspapers received in  the Library to manageable proportions for storage. Great steps forward  were also taken in the indexing of New Zealand newspapers and for the  first time in its history the Library had a complete index to all news  in two (later three) of the more important newspapers in the Dominion.  Mr Wauchop retired at the beginning of 1955.                             FIRE AND FIRE INSURANCE    No history would be complete without some mention of the fire of the  early morning of 11 December 1907 which destroyed most of Parliament  Buildings. It began in the old portion formerly occupied by the Library  at about 2 a.m. and rapidly spread to the Legislative Council on one  side and the House of Representatives on the other. Both these portions  were of wood and burned fiercely.    Though the Library was in the brick portion, fire danger had still been  considered to be great so that earlier in the year the stackroom  windows overlooking the courtyard had been bricked up. In addition, the  entrance door was protected by a steel blind.    It appeared at first that the Library was in no danger and no attempt  was made to remove books. Eventually, about 4 a.m. the roof of the new  committee rooms and entrance was in danger of catching alight, and Mr  Wilson decided to clear the building. With the help of some of the  staff and the general public, some 15,000 volumes were taken either to  the Government Buildings or to houses in Hill Street. Though the rear  portion of brick with wooden floors and partitions caught fire about 5  a.m. and damage was done to the roof, the Library was seen to be in no  further danger and the clearance was stopped.    Some slight damage was done to these books, but insurance covered this,  and generally little damage was done to the Library itself. The removal  of the wooden portion has reduced the risk of fire considerably, and  although the rear portion still has wooden floors, little of value is  stored here. If any future outbreak occurred it is probable that more  damage would be done by water. To prevent this a large drain was  recently made in the basement to allow water to escape readily.    After the fire there was some discussion on the possibility of using  the reading room as the Chamber of the House of Representatives, but  Government House was finally chosen. The brick building was repaired  and a covered access way provided across Sydney Street from the Library  to the Chamber.    At the time of the fire the Library was insured for L4,000, a small  portion of its true value. This insurance was continued until 1928 when  the cover was raised to L10,000, still much below the cost of  replacement. In 1942, with the introduction of war damage insurance and  the consequent increase of premiums, it was decided that the Library  should, like other Government Departments, not be insured, the  Government carrying the risk itself.                                     GENERAL    _Circulation of Books_    The first library rules that can be discovered today are those for  1869. Though it is certain that borrowing was permitted before this,  members were permitted by these rules to borrow two books for a period  of a fortnight. Even so, the privilege of borrowing was restricted to  the session.    It is doubtful if the rules were strictly enforced for as early as 1873  Mr T. Kelly from New Plymouth moved that the Library Committee should  be instructed to allow members outside Wellington the right to take out  books and to keep them for two months. Though the motion was not  approved it appears that members residing in Wellington did have books  at their homes.    No great change was made in the wording of the rules, but it appears  that at the end of the session members were taking books away, and in  1886 Mr James Macandrew from Dunedin admitted doing so. In the recess  of 1885-86 Sir James G. Wilson (Bulls) had written to the Librarian  asking for books to be sent to his home. The request was refused but  following it the House passed a motion recommending the Joint Committee  to prepare regulations for lending books during the recess to members  living outside Wellington.    The Committee, however, did not favour the idea and reported that there  were so many difficulties in the way that they would not carry it out.  On the motion of the Premier, Sir Robert Stout, the House reluctantly  agreed with the report.    There the matter rested until the session of 1891 when it was raised in  a question addressed to a Minister. As a result the Committee brought  down a report saying that they had agreed to a scheme for circulating  up to six books at a time to members in the recess. Certain reference  and valuable books, newspapers, and periodicals were excluded, but most  other works could be borrowed. The Library would provide boxes or  baskets for the transmission of the books, and six dozen were obtained  for the following recess. During it 34 members borrowed 438 volumes,  not one being lost, though two were damaged.    Both House and Council agreed to the scheme, though certain members  were violently opposed to it. Since then it has provided members with  reading material during many recesses. Certainly, some books have been  lost, but probably there would be an even greater chance of losses if  the practice of recess borrowing had not been regularised. In any case,  books often disappear from the shelves in libraries with the best  oversight and supervision and are never seen again.      _Fiction_    The provision of fiction in the Library has been criticised, but novels  have been purchased since the early seventies. The numbers purchased  have always been small, and have given well earned relaxation and  pleasure to legislators as well as building up what is the only  collection of the minor nineteenth century classics that exists in the  Dominion. These books are frequently in demand by students of  nineteenth century English literature.      _Inter-library Loan_    In keeping with the policy of allowing the widest possible use of the  Library, while at the same time retaining all books necessary for  Parliament, the Committee in 1909 drew up rules which would have  permitted university libraries to borrow. Little use, however, seems to  have been made of the privilege.    In 1936 the Committee gave approval for the participation of the  Library in the New Zealand Library Association scheme. Libraries  outside have not been slow to take advantage, and while considerable  restrictions exist on the books that can be lent, only one book is  borrowed by the General Assembly Library for every 20 or so lent.      _Recess Privileges_    Though the Library is primarily the Library of Parliament, it has  always been generous in allowing the use of its resources to students  and others. As early as 1875, while books could only be taken out by  members of Parliament, heads of Departments, and Judges, the Recess  Committee had discretion to allow the use of the Library for reference  and study.    The minutes and correspondence show that the demands were many and that  permission was frequently given. There was no general rule about  admission, and as a result individual application was necessary. Mr  Collier did his best to liberalise the privilege, but at the same time  he wanted the use limited to genuine students rather than to those who  wanted it for prestige and as a means of obtaining light reading.    A resolution of 1891 allowed the privilege to be granted on the  recommendation of a member of Parliament, head of a Government  Department, or local clergyman, but by the end of the century the right  was restricted to members of Parliament. The recess privilege did not  allow borrowers to take out current fiction though classic fiction  could be borrowed.    The rules have long permitted the use of the library for brief periods  by serious research workers. The position has now been placed on a  permanent basis, and students at the honours stage at the University or  undertaking serious research are allowed to use two special rooms in  the Library.    Here it might be well to mention the request that has recently been  made to allow the Library to keep open until 6 p.m. during the recess.  This has been done three times in the past, in 1892-93, in 1903-04, and  again in 1911, but the use was so small that the hours of 9 a.m. to 5  p.m. were quickly reverted to.      _The National Library_    Though the General Assembly Library is principally the Library of  Parliament, many of its functions are those of a national library and  this matter has been raised on many occasions. The earliest references  are those of James Collier in 1888, and his remarks are of interest,  \"... the Library of the General Assembly [may] develop or, as is more  probable, bifurcate into a national library ...\"    As the only large State library, it was natural that the General  Assembly Library should be regarded as the basis of a national library  and there were frequent references to this side of the Library's work  in the debates on copyright deposit in 1903 and 1913. About the same  time the Library Association meeting in Wellington carried a resolution  saying that the Library should be regarded as the nucleus of a national  reference library.    The matter was not forgotten but rather lay dormant until 1935 when the  Munn-Barr report on New Zealand libraries suggested the amalgamation of  the General Assembly and Turnbull Libraries, together with a country  lending"]]]
