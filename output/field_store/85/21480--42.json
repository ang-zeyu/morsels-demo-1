This large toad is characteristically found in areas supporting tropical  scrub forest to elevations of about 1000 meters. The species is much  more abundant than the numbers listed above suggest. In the dry season  individuals have been observed in patios, along streams, and by  irrigation ditches. In the rainy season the loud, rattling call of the  males is heard at night throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley and the  coastal lowlands.    Taylor and Smith (1945:552) revived Wiegmann's _Bufo horribilis_ for the  large toads of Mexico that are here referred to _B. marinus_. Their  action was based upon the supposition that the \"species _marinus_\" is  composite. Although probably true, this supposition has yet to be  proved. Until the large, and apparently related, species of _Bufo_  inhabiting tropical America have been studied systematically as a unit,  the recognition of segments of the population as either species or  subspecies is meaningless. Taylor and Smith (op. cit.:553) based the  description of a new species, _Bufo angustipes_, on one rather  emaciated, formalin-hardened female from La Esperanza, Chiapas. The type  (USNM 116513), when compared with numerous specimens of _Bufo marinus_  from throughout the range of the species in Mexico and northern Central  America, displays no combination of characters to set it off from the  others. Therefore, I suggest that _Bufo horribilis_ Wiegmann and _Bufo  angustipes_ Taylor and Smith be placed in the synonymy of _Bufo marinus_  (Linnaeus) until future systematic study of the genus and this species  in particular establishes the existence of recognizable taxa.      ~Bufo marmoreus~ Wiegmann         _Bufo marmoreus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 26:66,       1833.--Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico.

In Michoacan this species is confined to elevations of less than 1000  meters on the coast and foothills of the Sierra de Coalcoman. In this  region in the months of June and July, breeding congregations have been  found in temporary pools and along streams.    Smith and Taylor (1948:39), in their key to the Mexican species of  _Bufo_, placed emphasis on the nature of the supraorbital and  postorbital crests (whether they form a curve or a sharp angle) in  distinguishing _Bufo marmoreus_ from _Bufo perplexus_. In the original  description of _perplexus_, Taylor (1943a:347) characterized the species  as follows: supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp angle,  instead of a curve as in _marmoreus_; supratympanic crest smaller than  in _marmoreus_; diagonal lateral stripe lacking in females;  concentration of dorsal tubercles as found in _marmoreus_ lacking in  males. The discovery of specimens in which the crests form a curve and  others in which the crests form an angle in both the Tepalcatepec Valley  and in the coastal lowlands prompted an investigation of these  characters and others throughout the ranges of the species. An  examination of 410 specimens has resulted in the following conclusions.      TABLE 1.--VARIATION IN THE SHAPE OF THE SUPRAORBITAL AND POSTORBITAL  CRANIAL CRESTS IN BUFO MARMOREUS AND B.

Although the highest percentage of individuals having the      supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp angle is      from localities in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, numerous      individuals from throughout the range of _marmoreus_ have the      crests forming an angle (Table 1).         2. In all samples of ten or more specimens, some toads have       the supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp       angle, some have the crests forming a curve, and some have       an intermediate condition.         3. The relative size of the supratympanic crest is highly       variable in all samples examined.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.

A distinct, pale-colored, diagonal lateral stripe is       found in females only from localities outside of the       Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin; females from the basin have a       spotted dorsum.         5. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin usually have a       broad middorsal line that is yellow or pale tan; those from       outside the basin have either a narrow middorsal line or       none.         6. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin have low,       scattered dorsal tubercles (Fig. 3); males from outside the       basin have a concentration of tubercles in a broad band on       the back (Fig. 4).    Therefore the nature of the cranial crests is of little value in  separating two populations, but the color pattern of the females and the  nature of the dorsal tubercles of the males do show distinct  differences. Furthermore, certain differences in size and proportion are  evident; _Bufo marmoreus_ is a slightly larger toad and has a relatively  longer tibia and longer head than _perplexus_ (Table 2).

(10.) This male was caught as a subadult twice at the same       place on November 30 and December 14. By the following       autumn he had shifted to a new location 180 feet south along       the outcrop, and he was caught there on September 22 and       October 18, 1951, and on January 20 and February 2, 1952.           _Females_         (11.) This female was captured 27 times over a span of 211       days. She moved back and forth considerably between two       houses 40 feet apart but made only one substantial movement       of 245 feet; at this time she was in breeding condition.       Nearly seven months after the first capture she was seen for       the last time only 16 feet from the original site of       capture. It was assumed she fell prey to spotted skunks       which were raiding traps.         (12.) First captured on March 24, 1951, she remained on the       area 105 days in which period she was live-trapped 25 times.       Sixty per cent of the total captures were at the same house       and the longest movement recorded was only 56 feet. She was       last caught in a trap 25 feet from the site of original       capture.         (13.) This young adult remained at her house at the rock       fence approximately four months. In this period she was       captured 11 times. On March 16, 1952, she had moved 410 feet       to a house at the eastern section of outcrop, probably       searching for a male. She was never seen again.         (14.) This subadult female moved from the site of original       capture to a house 253 feet away on the same outcrop. She       was probably in search of a new home when caught the first       time. She was recorded at another house 40 feet away on one       occasion.         (15.) Over a span of 90 days and 15 captures this female was       not recorded as making any movement. She was living in one       of the woodland houses. Mature males were numerous in the       area and she was visited by at least two.         (16.) This female was also living in the woodland section       and was first caught on March 30, 1952, in one of the less       favorable houses. She was trapped 17 times over a period of       85 days. One movement of 68 feet to a new home site was       recorded, but the area of foraging probably did not change.       She was caught here four times and then disappeared.         (17.) This female was first trapped as a subadult on October       5, 1948, at a house in brush on the upper part of a north       slope. On November 24 she had shifted 590 feet to the bottom       of the slope and was living in the recess beneath an       undermined honey locust on a gully bank. On November 25 she       was caught in a similar situation 100 feet farther east       along the gully bank. She was recaptured at the gully on       November 26 and 30, December 1, 3, 22, and March 8 and 9,       and in all she shifted six times between the two gully-bank       dens.         (18.) This female was first trapped as an adult on November       18, 1948, in a gully-bank den. She was recaptured at this       same place a year later, on November 18 and 30, 1949. On       February 19, 1950, she was caught at a hollow sycamore 650       feet farther up the gully, and she was recaptured there on       February 25 and April 7, and on June 15, 1951. On August 6,       1951, she was caught at a house in a thicket on the gully       bank, between the first and second locations and 150 feet       from the latter.         (19.) This female was recorded only twice; on October 15,       1948, she was at a hilltop rock outcrop. On July 14, 1950,       she had moved 1480 feet and was living in a rock pile at the       base of the slope, near the same hollow sycamore where       female No. 18 had been caught.         (20.) This female was first caught as an adult on April 5,       1950, at a large boulder of a hillside rock outcrop. On       October 7, 1950, she had shifted 110 feet to a house at an       osage orange tree on the hilltop rock outcrop. On November 9       she was back at the first location and on November 28 she       had moved 70 feet south along the hillside outcrop. On       January 11 and February 9, 1951, she was back at the       original location. On November 9, and 21, 1951, she was       again at the site 70 feet south, and was still there at her       last capture on February 3, 1952.    Ordinarily each house that is in use harbors only a single woodrat. To a  greater degree than any other kind of mammal on this area woodrats show  intraspecific intolerance. On various occasions when captives were  placed in the same or adjacent cages, they focused their attention on  each other with evident hostility, the more powerful or aggressive  individuals attacking or pursuing. Several times the confinement of two  rats in the same live-trap or cage resulted in the death of the weaker  individual, and seemingly this is the normal outcome unless the attacked  rat is able to escape. On various other occasions two or more rats have  been caught in the same trap simultaneously but in every instance these  were either: a pair of adults, the female appearing to be in oestrus; a  lactating female and one or more of her young; or young less than  half-grown, that were obviously litter mates. Older woodrats, especially  males, often have their ears torn and punctured from fighting.    Territoriality involves, primarily, defense of the house itself. An  individual that ventures into an occupied house may be quickly routed by  the occupant even though the latter is smaller. Chasing has been  observed occasionally, but it is doubtful whether any individual is able  consistently to defend the entire area over which it forages. Because  each rat spends most of its time within the shelter of its house, an  intruder might venture onto its home range unchallenged and undetected,  so long as it did not enter the nest cavity.    An adult female was live-trapped on October 14, 1951, beside her house  at the outcrop. As soon as she was released, she disappeared within the  house. After approximately two minutes, a soft, high pitched whine was  heard and immediately another woodrat dashed into view closely followed  by the female. The chase continued for several seconds in the vicinity  of the house, but the woodrat being chased soon left the area _via_ the  outcrop. Probably this intruder had moved into the house in the night  while the female was in the trap.    On June 17, 1952, an adult male was found in a live-trap set at one of  the brush pile houses in the woodland area. This house was occupied by  an adult female. He ran into the house after release, and immediately  there was a loud squeal. He ran outside and paused under some limbs  approximately 15 feet from the house, and remained there for 15 minutes  before clipping off an ironweed 12 inches long, which he carried to the  house. He did not enter the house but stopped beneath overhanging sticks  at the edge, eating leaves from the plant. He made another attempt to  enter the house but loud squeals and rustling followed and he returned  to the ironweed plant and was still eating when observations were  halted. In another instance, squeals and rustling indicated that the  occupant and intruder were in combat.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Diagram illustrating spacing (due to  territoriality or intolerance of the rats) in twelve woodrat houses in a  hedge row extending south from south boundary of the Reservation at the  middle.]    Although home ranges may overlap to some extent, intraspecific  intolerance tends to maintain a certain minimum interval between houses.  The arrangement of twelve houses along a hedge row 1170 feet long is  diagrammatically represented in Figure 2. The average interval was 78.5  feet (minimum 42; maximum 171). The habitat was uniform. Home ranges  probably overlap somewhat, and the spacing is the expression of the need  for an otherwise unoccupied area in which there is sufficient space to  live. Because individuals tend to fight whenever they meet, there is  probably a psychological tendency for sequestration which results in  spacing of houses and reduces social contact thereby avoiding a  depletion of energy that would be detrimental to the population. Whereas  condition of the hedge row determines whether or not it will be  inhabited by woodrats, length determines the number of occupants. The  spacing of houses in a hedge row must be attributed to something other  than restriction of sites because the number of sites available always  exceeds the number that are in use. Although rock outcrops situated in  areas of uniform habitat have not been observed to the extent that hedge  rows have, a similar spacing seems to exist and the sites available for  houses always exceed the actual number found. This behavior pattern  limits the number of houses and is probably advantageous to the species  through preventing overcrowding and possible critical depletion of the  food supply.    Eleven of the young that weighed 100 grams or less when originally  captured and were presumably still living at the mothers' houses, were  recaptured repeatedly over periods of weeks or months, providing a  limited amount of information regarding dispersal. They followed no  definite pattern. In seven instances (five males and two females) the  young stayed on at the house beyond the age when they were completely  independent of the female. In at least two instances the female was  known to have moved away while the young remained. One female shifted to  a house 58 feet from the one where she had reared her litter of two, and  was accompanied by the young male, while the young female stayed on in  possession of the maternal house. Two months later this young female was  caught at a house 90 feet away, and an adult male was in possession of  her former house. One young male shifted to a house 220 feet from his"]]]
