[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#6)"],[1," two  stars which subtend at the eye an angle no greater than that subtended  by an adjoining pair of the sixty minute dots around the circumference  of a watch-dial a mile distant from the observer.    This power of directing the instrument so accurately would be of but  little avail unless it were combined with arrangements by which, when  once the telescope has been pointed correctly, the position of the star  can be ascertained and recorded. One element in the determination of the  position is secured by the astronomical clock, which gives the moment  when the object crosses the central vertical wire; the other element is  given by the graduated circle which reads the angular distance of the  star from the zenith or point directly overhead.    Superb meridian instruments adorn our great observatories, and are  nightly devoted to those measurements upon which the great truths of  astronomy are mainly based. These instruments have been constructed with  refined skill; but it is the duty of the painstaking astronomer to  distrust the accuracy of his instrument in every conceivable way. The  great tube may be as rigid a structure as mechanical engineers can  produce; the graduations on the circle may have been engraved by the  most perfect of dividing machines; but the conscientious astronomer will  not be content with mere mechanical precision. That meridian circle  which, to the uninitiated, seems a marvellous piece of workmanship,  possessing almost illimitable accuracy, is viewed in a very different  light by the astronomer who makes use of it. No one can appreciate more  fully than he the skill of the artist who has made that meridian circle,  and the beautiful contrivances for illumination and reading off which  give to the instrument its perfection; but while the astronomer  recognises the beauty of the actual machine he is using, he has always  before his mind's eye an ideal instrument of absolute perfection, to  which the actual meridian circle only makes an approximation.    Contrasted with the ideal instrument, the finest meridian circle is  little more than a mass of imperfections. The ideal tube is perfectly  rigid, the actual tube is flexible; the ideal divisions of the circle  are perfectly uniform, the actual divisions are not uniform. The ideal  instrument is a geometrical embodiment of perfect circles, perfect  straight lines, and perfect right angles; the actual instrument can only  show approximate circles, approximate straight lines, and approximate  right angles. Perhaps the spider's part of the work is on the whole the  best; the stretched web gives us the nearest mechanical approach to a  perfectly straight line; but we mar the spider's work by not being able  to insert those beautiful threads with perfect uniformity, while our  attempts to adjust two of them across the field of view at right angles  do not succeed in producing an angle of exactly ninety degrees.    Nor are the difficulties encountered by the meridian observer due solely  to his instrument. He has to contend against his own imperfections; he  has often to allow for personal peculiarities of an unexpected nature;  the troubles that the atmosphere can give are notorious; while the  levelling of his instrument warns him that he cannot even rely on the  solid earth itself. We learn that the earthquakes, by which the solid  ground is sometimes disturbed, are merely the more conspicuous  instances of incessant small movements in the earth which every night in  the year derange the delicate adjustment of the instrument.    When the existence of these errors has been recognised, the first great  step has been taken. By an alliance between the astronomer and the  mathematician it is possible to measure the discrepancies between the  actual meridian circle and the instrument that is ideally perfect. Once  this has been done, we can estimate the effect which the irregularities  produce on the observations, and finally, we succeed in purging the  observations from the grosser errors by which they are contaminated. We  thus obtain results which are not indeed mathematically accurate, but  are nevertheless close approximations to those which would be obtained  by a perfect observer using an ideal instrument of geometrical accuracy,  standing on an earth of absolute rigidity, and viewing the heavens  without the intervention of the atmosphere.    In addition to instruments like those already indicated, astronomers  have other means of following the motions of the heavenly bodies. Within  the last fifteen years photography has commenced to play an important  part in practical astronomy. This beautiful art can be utilised for  representing many objects in the heavens by more faithful pictures than  the pencil of even the most skilful draughtsman can produce. Photography  is also applicable for making charts of any region in the sky which it  is desired to examine. When repeated pictures of the same region are  made from time to time, their comparison gives the means of ascertaining  whether any star has moved during the interval. The amount and direction  of this motion may be ascertained by a delicate measuring apparatus  under which the photographic plate is placed.    If a refracting telescope is to be used for taking celestial  photographs, the lenses of the object-glass must be specially designed  for this purpose. The rays of light which imprint an image on the  prepared plate are not exactly the same as those which are chiefly  concerned in the production of the image on the retina of the human eye.  A reflecting mirror, however, brings all the rays, both those which are  chemically active and those which are solely visual, to one and the  same focus. The same reflecting instrument may therefore be used either  for looking at the heavens or for taking pictures on a photographic  plate which has been substituted for the observer's eye.    A simple portrait camera has been advantageously employed for obtaining  striking photographs of larger areas of the sky than can be grasped in a  long telescope; but for purposes of accurate measurement those taken  with the latter are incomparably better.    It is needless to say that the photographic apparatus, whatever it may  be, must be driven by delicately-adjusted clockwork to counteract the  apparent daily motion of the stars caused by the rotation of the earth.  The picture would otherwise be spoiled, just as a portrait is ruined if  the sitter does not remain quiet during the exposure.    Among the observatories in the United Kingdom the Royal Observatory at  Greenwich is of course the most famous. It is specially remarkable among  all the similar institutions in the world for the continuity of its  labours for several generations. Greenwich Observatory was founded in  1675 for the promotion of astronomy and navigation, and the observations  have from the first been specially arranged with the object of  determining with the greatest accuracy the positions of the principal  fixed stars, the sun, the moon, and the planets. In recent years,  however, great developments of the work of the Observatory have been  witnessed, and the most modern branches of the science are now  assiduously pursued there.    The largest equatorial at Greenwich is a refractor of twenty-eight  inches aperture and twenty-eight feet long, constructed by Sir Howard  Grubb. A remarkable composite instrument from the same celebrated  workshop has also been recently added to our national institution. It  consists of a great refractor specially constructed for photography, of  twenty-six inches aperture (presented by Sir Henry Thompson) and a  reflector of thirty inches diameter, which is the product of Dr.  Common's skill. The huge volume published annually bears witness to the  assiduity with which the Astronomer Royal and his numerous staff of  assistant astronomers make use of the splendid means at their disposal.    The southern part of the heavens, most of which cannot be seen in this  country, is watched from various observatories in the southern  hemisphere. Foremost among them is the Royal Observatory at the Cape of  Good Hope, which is furnished with first-class instruments. We may  mention a great photographic telescope, the gift of Mr. M'Clean.  Astronomy has been greatly enriched by the many researches made by Dr.  Gill, the director of the Cape Observatory.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--The Great Bear.]    It is not, however, necessary to use such great instruments to obtain  some idea of the aid the telescope will afford. The most suitable  instrument for commencing astronomical studies is within ordinary reach.  It is the well-known binocular that a captain uses on board ship; or if  that cannot be had, then the common opera-glass will answer nearly as  well. This is, no doubt, not so powerful as a telescope, but it has some  compensating advantages. The opera-glass will enable us to survey a  large region of the sky at one glance, while a telescope, generally  speaking, presents a much smaller field of view.    Let us suppose that the observer is provided with an opera-glass and is  about to commence his astronomical studies. The first step is to become  acquainted with the conspicuous group of seven stars represented in Fig.  9. This group is often called the Plough, or Charles's Wain, but  astronomers prefer to regard it as a portion of the constellation of the  Great Bear (Ursa Major). There are many features of interest in this  constellation, and the beginner should learn as soon as possible to  identify the seven stars which compose it. Of these the two marked  a and b, at the head of the Bear, are generally called the  \"pointers.\" They are of special use, because they serve to guide the eye  to that most important star in the whole sky, known as the \"pole star.\"    Fix the attention on that region in the Great Bear, which forms a sort  of rectangle, of which the stars a b g d are the corners. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2742"],[0,"Cenci (#6)"],[1," and degrading a fashion?\"    At length, overcome by so many entreaties, he respited them for three  days.    The most eloquent and skilful advocates in Rome immediately busied  themselves in preparing pleadings for so emotional a case, and on the  day fixed for hearing appeared before His Holiness.    The first pleader was Nicolo degli Angeli, who spoke with such force and  eloquence that the pope, alarmed at the effect he was producing among  the audience, passionately interrupted him.    \"Are there then to be found,\" he indignantly cried, \"among the Roman  nobility children capable of killing their parents, and among Roman  lawyers men capable of speaking in their defence? This is a thing we  should never have believed, nor even for a moment supposed it possible!\"    All were silent upon this terrible rebuke, except Farinacci, who,  nerving himself with a strong sense of duty, replied respectfully but  firmly--    \"Most Holy Father, we are not here to defend criminals, but to save the  innocent; for if we succeeded in proving that any of the accused acted  in self-defence, I hope that they will be exonerated in the eyes of your  Holiness; for just as the law provides for cases in which the father may  legally kill the child, so this holds good in the converse. We will  therefore continue our pleadings on receiving leave from your Holiness  to do so.\"    Clement VIII then showed himself as patient as he had previously been  hasty, and heard the argument of Farinacci, who pleaded that Francesco  Cenci had lost all the rights of a father from, the day that he violated  his daughter. In support of his contention he wished to put in the  memorial sent by Beatrice to His Holiness, petitioning him, as her  sister had done, to remove her from the paternal roof and place her in a  convent. Unfortunately, this petition had disappeared, and  notwithstanding the minutest search among the papal documents, no trace  of it could be found.    The pope had all the pleadings collected, and dismissed the advocates,  who then retired, excepting d'Altieri, who knelt before him, saying--    \"Most Holy Father, I humbly ask pardon for appearing before you in this  case, but I had no choice in the matter, being the advocate of the  poor.\"    The pope kindly raised him, saying:    \"Go; we are not surprised at your conduct, but at that of others, who  protect and defend criminals.\"    As the pope took a great interest in this case, he sat up all night over  it, studying it with Cardinal di San Marcello, a man of much acumen and  great experience in criminal cases. Then, having summed it up, he sent a  draft of his opinion to the advocates, who read it with great  satisfaction, and entertained hopes that the lives of the convicted  persons would be spared; for the evidence all went to prove that even if  the children had taken their father's life, all the provocation came  from him, and that Beatrice in particular had been dragged into the part  she had taken in this crime by the tyranny, wickedness, and brutality of  her father. Under the influence of these considerations the pope  mitigated the severity of their prison life, and even allowed the  prisoners to hope that their lives would not be forfeited.    Amidst the general feeling of relief afforded to the public by these  favours, another tragical event changed the papal mind and frustrated  all his humane intentions. This was the atrocious murder of the Marchese  di Santa Croce, a man seventy years of age, by his son Paolo, who  stabbed him with a dagger in fifteen or twenty places, because the  father would not promise to make Paolo his sole heir. The murderer fled  and escaped.    Clement VIII was horror-stricken at the increasing frequency of this  crime of parricide: for the moment, however, he was unable to take  action, having to go to Monte Cavallo to consecrate a cardinal titular  bishop in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli; but the day following,  on Friday the 10th of September 1599, at eight o'clock in the morning,  he summoned Monsignor Taverna, governor of Rome, and said to him--    \"Monsignor, we place in your hands the Cenci case, that you may carry  out the sentence as speedily as possible.\"    On his return to his palace, after leaving His Holiness, the governor  convened a meeting of all the criminal judges in the city, the result of  the council being that all the Cenci were condemned to death.    The final sentence was immediately known; and as this unhappy family  inspired a constantly increasing interest, many cardinals spent the  whole of the night either on horseback or in their carriages, making  interest that, at least so far as the women were concerned, they should  be put to death privately and in the prison, and that a free pardon  should be granted to Bernardo, a poor lad only fifteen years of age,  who, guiltless of any participation in the crime, yet found himself  involved in its consequences. The one who interested himself most in the  case was Cardinal Sforza, who nevertheless failed to elicit a single  gleam of hope, so obdurate was His Holiness. At length Farinacci,  working on the papal conscience, succeeded, after long and urgent  entreaties, and only at the last moment, that the life of Bernardo  should be spared.    From Friday evening the members of the brotherhood of the Conforteria  had gathered at the two prisons of Corte Savella and Tordinona. The  preparations for the closing scene of the tragedy had occupied workmen  on the bridge of Sant' Angelo all night; and it was not till five  o'clock in the morning that the registrar entered the cell of Lucrezia  and Beatrice to read their sentences to them.    Both were sleeping, calm in the belief of a reprieve. The registrar woke  them, and told them that, judged by man, they must now prepare to appear  before God.    Beatrice was at first thunderstruck: she seemed paralysed and  speechless; then she rose from bed, and staggering as if intoxicated,  recovered her speech, uttering despairing cries. Lucrezia heard the  tidings with more firmness, and proceeded to dress herself to go to the  chapel, exhorting Beatrice to resignation; but she, raving, wrung her,  hands and struck her head against the wall, shrieking, \"To die! to die!  Am I to die unprepared, on a scaffold! on a gibbet! My God! my God!\"  This fit led to a terrible paroxysm, after which the exhaustion of her  body enabled her mind to recover its balance, and from that moment she  became an angel of humility and an example of resignation.    Her first request was for a notary to make her will. This was  immediately complied with, and on his arrival she dictated its  provisions with much calmness and precision. Its last clause desired her  interment in the church of San Pietro in Montorio, for which she always  had a strong attachment, as it commanded a view of her father's palace.  She bequeathed five hundred crowns to the nuns of the order of the  Stigmata, and ordered that her dowry; amounting to fifteen thousand  crowns, should be distributed in marriage portions to fifty poor girls.  She selected the foot of the high altar as the place where she wished to  be buried, over which hung the beautiful picture of the Transfiguration,  so often admired by her during her life.    Following her example, Lucrezia in her turn, disposed of her property:  she desired to be buried in the church of San Giorgio di Velobre, and  left thirty-two thousand crowns to charities, with other pious legacies.  Having settled their earthly affairs, they joined in prayer, reciting  psalms, litanies, and prayers far the dying.    At eight o'clock they confessed, heard mass, and received the  sacraments; after which Beatrice, observing to her stepmother that the  rich dresses they wore were out of place on a scaffold, ordered two to  be made in nun's fashion--that is to say, gathered at the neck, with  long wide sleeves. That for Lucrezia was made of black cotton stuff,  Beatrice's of taffetas. In addition she had a small black turban made to  place on her head. These dresses, with cords for girdles, were brought  them; they were placed on a chair, while the women continued to pray.    The time appointed being near at hand, they were informed that their  last moment was approaching. Then Beatrice, who was still on her knees,  rose with a tranquil and almost joyful countenance. \"Mother,\" said she,  \"the moment of our suffering is impending; I think we had better dress  in these clothes, and help one another at our toilet for the last time.\"  They then put on the dresses provided, girt themselves with the cords;  Beatrice placed her turban on her head, and they awaited the last  summons.    In the meantime, Giacomo and Bernardo, whose sentences had been read to  them, awaited also the moment of their death. About ten o'clock the  members of the Confraternity of Mercy, a Florentine order, arrived at  the prison of Tordinona, and halted on the threshold with the crucifix,  awaiting the appearance of the unhappy youths. Here a serious accident  had nearly happened. As many persons were at the prison windows to see  the prisoners come out, someone accidentally threw down a large  flower-pot full of earth, which fell into the street and narrowly missed  one of the Confraternity who was amongst the torch-bearers just before  the crucifix. It passed so close to the torch as to extinguish the flame  in its descent.    At this moment the gates opened, and Giacomo appeared first on the  threshold. He fell on his knees, adoring the holy crucifix with great  devotion. He was completely covered with a large mourning cloak, under  which his bare breast was prepared to be torn by the red-hot pincers of  the executioner, which were lying ready in a chafing-dish fixed to the  cart. Having ascended the vehicle, in which the executioner placed him  so as more readily to perform this office, Bernardo came out, and was  thus addressed on his appearance by the fiscal of "]]]
