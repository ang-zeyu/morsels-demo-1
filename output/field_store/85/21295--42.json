Looked at in this latter aspect, it may assert an  antiquity almost as great as St. Peter's, York, which claims--and not  without reason--to be the senior boys' school in the country. Colet so  looked forward to the different requirements of different ages that  his statutes did not tie his school down to any cut and dried course  of study; but let us hope place will always be found for the Greek  Testament. What are we to think of the preacher who, while denouncing  war, so pricked the conscience of Henry VIII. that the king sent to  consult him? What of the Bible student who thought that the story of  Creation was an allegory, and intended to teach the ignorant  Israelites that the one God had created everybody and everything? What  of the reformer who went beyond Erasmus in denouncing the profane  excesses perpetrated in the name of religion at the shrine of Becket  at Canterbury? Colet died of the \"sweating sickness\" at the early age  of fifty-three, in 1519; and it is idle to speculate on his action had  he lived until the breach with Rome. His monument in the south aisle  of the choir perished in the Fire; and in the new Renaissance  cathedral a second might well be erected to the memory of this great  leader of the Renaissance in theology and learning, the greatest among  many great occupants of the Dean's stall.       [Illustration: TOMB OF JOHN COLET, D.D., DEAN OF ST. PAUL'S.     _After Hollar._]    =Reformation Principles Opposed.=--The still smouldering doctrines of  Wycliffe were now fanned into a flame; and Wolsey endeavoured to  extinguish them without having resort to the stake Tyndal's New  Testament, translated into English in 1526 at Worms, must have been  speedily smuggled across the Channel. On the Shrove Tuesday of 1527  Wolsey attended St. Paul's, accompanied by some six-and-thirty  prelates, mitred abbots, and other high dignitaries. Barnes of  Cambridge, formerly a friar, and five others, \"Stillyard men,\" were  brought from the Fleet prison in penitential array, Barnes carrying a  heavy taper, the rest faggots. Testaments and other forbidden books  were in baskets by a fire in the nave. On their knees the penitents  recanted; while Barnes declared that he deserved to be burnt. Fisher  again preached; and the six pardoned offenders were taken inside the  rails and made to walk round the fire, after which the books were  burnt--by no means a solitary literary conflagration.    =Reformation Principles Advanced.=--In order to raise money, Henry  declared that as the clergy had acquiesced in the authority of Wolsey  as legate, and as such acquiescence was contrary to the Statute of  Provisors, all these benefices were forfeit to the Crown, and a heavy  subsidy must be paid as ransom. The clergy of the diocese of London,  considering that the arch-offender against this Statute was Henry  himself, and next to him the prelates and great mitred abbots,  attended a meeting at the Chapter House, and were assisted by a number  of their parishioners. John Stokesley, Bishop designate,[24] who  presided, and who had to see the assessment made, could neither keep  order nor gain his point: \"We never meddled, let the bishops and  abbots pay.\" Fifteen priests and four parishioners were imprisoned,  and, of course, Henry gained his point.    Throughout 1534 the deanery was vacant. The Bishop was directed to see  that the appointed preachers at Paul's Cross taught that the Pope had  no spiritual authority of divine right. Here as elsewhere it is  remarkable with what ease and unanimity the papal jurisdiction based  on the Petrine claims was done away with. No dignitary--and Bonner  that year became Prebendary of Chiswick--no priest of humbler rank  connected with the cathedral, either resigned or got into trouble on  this important doctrinal question; although the execution of those two  earnest men, John Fisher and Thomas More, who opposed the divorce and  the abrogation of the papal claims, was followed by a pronouncement of  excommunication, deposition, and an interdict on the part of Paul III.  Yet at St. Paul's, nineteen Anabaptists--a sect whom no one  pitied--were sentenced to be burnt, and of these a man and a woman  suffered at Smithfield, and the remainder in the provinces. The next  year (1536) Hugh Latimer, as earnest and good a bishop as Fisher and  his exact opposite, preaching before Convocation, denounced abuses in  the spirit of an age which did not hesitate to call a spade a spade.  \"Lift up your heads, brethren, and look about with your eyes; spy what  things are to be reformed in the Church of England.\"    But more dramatic and more effective than the sonorous ring of honest  Hugh's eloquence, was the sermon at the Cross (February 14, 1538) of  Bishop John Hisley, Fisher's successor at Rochester, and formerly  Prior of the Dominicans in London. His subject was an ingenious piece  of mechanism, called the Rood of Grace, from Boxley in his diocese, a  source of revenue from devotees. Now, this product of the mechanic's  art does not seem to have had any resemblance to a Rood--_i.e._, a  large cross or crucifix--but rather was shaped like a big doll; and  Hisley demonstrated to his intelligent congregation of citizens how no  inherent power, but a man standing inside, with the aid of wires,  caused the rood to bow, and move its eyes and mouth.[25]    The exposure was followed next St. Bartholomew's eve by the removal of  the Great Rood at the north door, and those of our Lady of Grace and  of St. Uncumber. This last saint is supposed to be a foreign princess  of early times, styled also in England St. Wilgeforte. A peck of oats  was a favourite offering at her shrine in St. Paul's by those who  wished for favours; and according to Sir Thomas More she owed her  popular name because wives unhappy in their union so offered in the  hope that she would _uncumber_ (_i.e._, disencumber) them of their  husbands. The disgrace of Thomas Cromwell put a temporary stop to  actions of this nature; and we find Gardiner at the Cross denouncing  both Rome and Luther. We further find Barnes, our quondam penitent,  amongst those who replied from the same famous pulpit, and likening  himself and Gardiner to two fighting cocks, only that the _garden_  cock lacked good spurs. The result was that Barnes ended his chequered  career at the stake, as did others.    =Edward VI.=--So long as Henry lived it was dangerous to uphold either  the Petrine claims or the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and  it was equally dangerous to oppose the doctrine of transubstantiation;  but the Council of the child king would not have this latter doctrine,  and was distinctly Protestant. The endowments of the chantries had been  transferred to the Court of Augmentations in the autumn of 1545 (37  Henry VIII. c. 4) for the benefit of the king; but when at the  beginning of 1547 Edward succeeded his father, St. Paul's still  enjoyed her own. Somerset and his Protestant council not only wanted  the property, but objected to masses for the dead, and a renewing Act  was quickly passed, Edward's name taking his father's place. So went  chantries and _obits_ into the royal coffers, the list in Dugdale, as  returned to the Court, filling ten folio pages; while but little  commiseration was felt for the hard lot of these illiterate chaplains  deprived of their livelihood. And this was not all. Besides any  remaining roods and crucifixes, altars were demolished, tombs wrecked,  plate, jewels, vestments and frontals sold. Elaborate gold and silver  embroidered work found its way to Spanish cathedrals, and up to a short  time ago was reported to be still there.[26] Pardon Haugh Chapel was  desecrated, and the bones carted away to Finsbury; the Chapter House  cloisters went to build Somerset House. The dean, William May, was an  advanced Protestant; but so was not his bishop, Bonner. Bonner preached  at the Cross upholding transubstantiation, and was deprived and  imprisoned. It is to the credit of his successor, Ridley, that he  supported Bonner's mother and sister at Fulham; \"Our mother Bonner\"--he  was unmarried--taking the head of his table. Yet Ridley was one of the  judges at St. Paul's who sent the Anabaptist woman Joan Bucher to the  stake for heresy. During the first year or two of this reign, complains  Dean Milman, \"Sunday after Sunday the Cathedral was thronged, not with  decent and respectable citizens, but with a noisy rabble, many of them  boys, to hear unseemly harangues on that solemn rite\" [the Sacrament].  Ridley, after his translation (1550) restored comparative order, and  remained bishop long enough to witness the introduction of the Second  Prayer Book.    =Mary Tudor.=--When poor Edward came to his untimely end, Ridley sided  with the faction of Jane, and preached at the Cross, declaring both  Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate. For this he has been much censured;  but so far as the two princesses went--of course this would not make  Jane next of kin--he was but upholding the decisions of Ecclesiastical  Courts. In spite of any weakness in her title--and we have seen how  her mother had been married to Arthur at St. Paul's--Mary was  proclaimed, the bells rung, the Lords went in procession to hear _Te  Deum_ chanted; Bonner went back, and Dean May was replaced by John  Feckenham. Yet Mary's party by no means had everything their own way.  Gilbert Bourne, Prebendary of Wedland, who had retained his benefice  throughout the late reign and was now Chaplain to the Queen, preaching  at the Cross, was rudely interrupted with cries and throwing up of  caps; and had it not been for two of his brother canons, John Rogers  of St. Pancras and John Bradford of Cantlers, and others, who  conducted him in safety to the adjacent schoolroom, matters might have  gone ill with Mary's champion. Gardiner recanted his former heterodoxy  concerning the papal supremacy in a sermon; and Pole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25267"],[0,"Astronomy for Amateurs (#6)"],[1," next chapter), except the last ([delta]) of the quadrilateral,  which is of the third order.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--The Great Bear (or Dipper), and the Pole-Star.]    Figure 3 gives the outline of this primitive constellation. In revolving  in twenty-four hours round the Pole, which is situated at the  prolongation of a line drawn from [beta] to [alpha], it occupies every  conceivable position,--as if this page were turned in all directions.  But the relative arrangement of the seven stars remains unaltered. In  contemplating these seven stars it must never be forgotten that each is  a dazzling sun, a center of force and life. One of them is especially  remarkable: [zeta], known as Mizar to the Arabs. Those who have good  sight will distinguish near it a minute star, Alcor, or the Cavalier,  also called Saidak by the Arabs--that is, the Test, because it can be  used as a test of vision. But further, if you have a small telescope at  your disposal, direct it upon the fine star Mizar: you will be  astonished at discovering two of the finest diamonds you could wish to  see, with which no brilliant is comparable. There are several double  stars; these we shall become acquainted with later on.    Meantime, we must not forget our celestial geography. The Great Bear  will help us to find all the adjacent constellations.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--To find the Pole-Star.]    If a straight line is drawn (Fig. 4) from [beta] through [alpha], which  forms the extremity of the square, and is prolonged by a quantity equal  to the distance of [alpha] from the tip of the handle, we come on a star  of second magnitude, which marks the extremity of a figure perfectly  comparable with the Great Bear, but smaller, less brilliant, and  pointing in the contrary direction. This is the Little Bear, composed,  like its big brother, of seven stars; the one situated at the end of the  line by which we have found it is the Pole-Star.    Immovable in the region of the North Pole, the Pole-Star has captivated  all eyes by its position in the firmament. It is the providence of  mariners who have gone astray on the ocean, for it points them to the  North, while it is the pivot of the immense rotation accomplished round  it by all the stars in twenty-four hours. Hence it is a very important  factor, and we must hasten to find it, and render it due homage. It  should be added that its special immobility, in the prolongation of the  Earth's axis, is merely an effect caused by the diurnal movements of our  planet. Our readers are of course aware that it is the earth that turns  and not the sky. But evidence of this will be given later on. In looking  at the Pole-Star, the South is behind one, the East to the right, and  the West to the left.    Between the Great and the Little Bear, we can distinguish a winding  procession of smaller stars. These constitute the Dragon.    We will continue our journey by way of Cassiopeia, a fine constellation  placed on the opposite side of the Pole-Star in relation to the Great  Bear, and shaped somewhat like the open limbs of the letter W. It is  also called the Chair. And, in fact, when the figure is represented with  the line [alpha] [beta] below, the line [chi] [gamma] forms the seat,  and [gamma] [delta] [epsilon] its back.    If a straight line is drawn from [delta] of the Great Bear, and  prolonged beyond the Pole-Star in a quantity equal to the distance which  separates these two stars, it is easy to find this constellation (Fig.  5). This group, like the preceding, never sets, and is always visible,  opposite to the Great Bear. It revolves in twenty-four hours round the  Pole-Star, and is to be seen, now above, now below, now to the right,  now to the left.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--To find Cassiopeia.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--To Find Pegasus and Andromeda.]    If in the next place, starting from the stars [alpha] and [delta] in the  Great Bear, we draw two lines which join at Polaris and are prolonged  beyond Cassiopeia, we arrive at the Square of Pegasus (Fig. 6), a vast  constellation that terminates on one side in a prolongation formed of  three stars.    These three last stars belong to Andromeda, and themselves abut on  Perseus. The last star in the Square of Pegasus is also the first in  Andromeda.    [gamma] of Andromeda is a magnificent double orb, to which we shall  return in the next chapter, _i.e._, the telescope resolves it into two  marvelous suns, one of which is topaz-yellow, and the other  emerald-green. Three stars, indeed, are visible with more powerful  instruments.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Perseus, the Pleiades, Capella.]    Above [beta] and near a small star, is visible a faint, whitish,  luminous trail: this is the oblong nebula of Andromeda, the first  mentioned in the history of astronomy, and one of the most beautiful in  the Heavens, perceptible to the unaided eye on very clear nights.    The stars [alpha], [beta] and [gamma] of Perseus form a concave bow  which will serve in a new orientation. If it is prolonged in the  direction of [delta], we find a very brilliant star of the first  magnitude. This is Capella, the Goat, in the constellation of the  Charioteer (Fig. 7).    If coming back to [delta] in Perseus, a line is drawn toward the South,  we reach the Pleiades, a gorgeous cluster of stars, scintillating like  the finest dust of diamonds, on the shoulder of the Bull, to which we  shall come shortly, in studying the Constellations of the Zodiac.    Not far off is a very curious star, [beta] of Perseus, or Algol, which  forms a little triangle with two others smaller than itself. This star  is peculiar in that, instead of shining with a fixed light, it varies in  intensity, and is sometimes pale, sometimes brilliant. It belongs to the  category of variable stars which we shall study later on. All the  observations made on it for more than two hundred years go to prove that  a dark star revolves round this sun, almost in the plane of our line of  sight, producing as it passes in front of it a partial eclipse that  reduces it from the second to the fourth magnitude, every other two  days, twenty hours, and forty-nine minutes.    And now, let us return to the Great Bear, which aided us so beneficently  to start for these distant shores, and whence we shall set out afresh in  search of other constellations.    If we produce the curved line of the tail, or handle, we encounter a  magnificent golden-yellow star, a splendid sun of dazzling brilliancy:  let us make our bow to Arcturus, [alpha] of the Herdsman, which is at  the extremity of this pentagonal constellation. The principal stars of  this asterism are of the third magnitude, with the exception of [alpha],  which is of the first. Alongside of the Herdsman is a circle consisting  of five stars of the third and fourth magnitude, save the third,  [alpha], or the Pearl, which is of the second magnitude. This is the  Corona Borealis. It is very easily recognized (Fig. 8).    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--To find Arcturus, the Herdsman, and the Northern  Crown.]    A line drawn from the Pole-Star to Arcturus forms the base of an  equilateral triangle, the apex of which, situated opposite the Great  Bear, is occupied by Vega, or [alpha] of the Lyre, a splendid diamond of  ideal purity scintillating through the ether. This magnificent star, of  first magnitude, is, with Arcturus, the most luminous in our Heavens. It  burns with a white light, in the proximity of the Milky Way, not far  from a constellation that is very easily recognized by the arrangement  of its principal stars in the form of a cross. It is named Cygnus, the  Bird, or the Swan (Fig. 9), and is easy to find by the Square of  Pegasus, and the Milky Way. This figure, the brilliancy of whose  constituents (of the third and fourth magnitudes) contrasts strongly  with the pallor of the Milky Way, includes at its extremity at the foot  of the Cross, a superb double star, [beta] or Albirio: [alpha] of Cygnus  is also called Deneb. The first star of which the distance was  calculated is in this constellation. This little orb of fifth magnitude,  which hangs 69,000,000,000,000 kilometers (42,000,000,000,000 miles)  above our Earth, is the nearest of all the stars to the skies of Europe.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--The Swan, Vega, the Eagle.]    Not far off is the fine Eagle, which spreads its wings in the Milky Way,  and in which the star Altair, [alpha], of first magnitude, is situated  between its two satellites, [beta] and [gamma].    The Constellation of Hercules, toward which the motions of the Sun are  impelling us, with all the planets of its system, is near the Lyre. Its  principal stars can be recognized inside the triangle formed by the  Pole-Star, Arcturus, and Vega.    All the Constellations described above belong to the Northern  Hemisphere. Those nearest the pole are called circumpolar. They revolve  round the pole in twenty-four hours.    Having now learned the Northern Heavens, we must come back to the Sun,  which we have left behind us. The Earth revolves round him in a year,  and in consequence he seems to revolve round us, sweeping through a vast  circle of the celestial sphere. In each year, at the same period, he  passes the same points of the Heavens, in front of the same  constellations, which are rendered invisible by his light. We know that  the stars are at a fixed position from the Earth, whatever their  distance, and that if we do not see them at noon as at midnight, it is  simply because they are extinguished by the dazzling light of the orb of  day. With the aid of a telescope it is always possible to see the more  brilliant of them.    The Zodiac is the zone of stars traversed by the Sun in the course of a  year. This word is derived from the Greek _Zodiakos_, which signifies  \"animal,\" and this etymology arose because most of the figures traced  on this belt of stars represent animals. The belt is divided into twelve  parts that are "]]]
