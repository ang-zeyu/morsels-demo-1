I accompanied  her last week on a visit to the Vicar of S--, a small village in  the mountains, about a league hence. We arrived about four o'clock:  Charlotte had taken her little sister with her. When we entered the  vicarage court, we found the good old man sitting on a bench before  the door, under the shade of two large walnut-trees. At the sight  of Charlotte he seemed to gain new life, rose, forgot his stick, and  ventured to walk toward her. She ran to him, and made him sit down  again; then, placing herself by his side, she gave him a number of  messages from her father, and then caught up his youngest child, a  dirty, ugly little thing, the joy of his old age, and kissed it. I wish  you could have witnessed her attention to this old man,--how she raised  her voice on account of his deafness; how she told him of healthy young  people, who had been carried off when it was least expected; praised  the virtues of Carlsbad, and commended his determination to spend the  ensuing summer there; and assured him that he looked better and stronger  than he did when she saw him last. I, in the meantime, paid attention to  his good lady. The old man seemed quite in spirits; and as I could  not help admiring the beauty of the walnut-trees, which formed such  an agreeable shade over our heads, he began, though with some little  difficulty, to tell us their history. \"As to the oldest,\" said he, \"we  do not know who planted it,--some say one clergyman, and some another:  but the younger one, there behind us, is exactly the age of my wife,  fifty years old next October; her father planted it in the morning,  and in the evening she came into the world. My wife's father was my  predecessor here, and I cannot tell you how fond he was of that tree;  and it is fully as dear to me. Under the shade of that very tree, upon  a log of wood, my wife was seated knitting, when I, a poor student, came  into this court for the first time, just seven and twenty years ago.\"  Charlotte inquired for his daughter. He said she was gone with Herr  Schmidt to the meadows, and was with the haymakers. The old man then  resumed his story, and told us how his predecessor had taken a fancy  to him, as had his daughter likewise; and how he had become first his  curate, and subsequently his successor. He had scarcely finished his  story when his daughter returned through the garden, accompanied by the  above-mentioned Herr Schmidt. She welcomed Charlotte affectionately,  and I confess I was much taken with her appearance. She was a  lively-looking, good-humoured brunette, quite competent to amuse one for  a short time in the country. Her lover (for such Herr Schmidt evidently  appeared to be) was a polite, reserved personage, and would not join  our conversation, notwithstanding all Charlotte's endeavours to draw  him out. I was much annoyed at observing, by his countenance, that  his silence did not arise from want of talent, but from caprice and  ill-humour. This subsequently became very evident, when we set out to  take a walk, and Frederica joining Charlotte, with whom I was talking,  the worthy gentleman's face, which was naturally rather sombre, became  so dark and angry that Charlotte was obliged to touch my arm, and remind  me that I was talking too much to Frederica. Nothing distresses me more  than to see men torment each other; particularly when in the flower of  their age, in the very season of pleasure, they waste their few short  days of sunshine in quarrels and disputes, and only perceive their error  when it is too late to repair it. This thought dwelt upon my mind; and  in the evening, when we returned to the vicar's, and were sitting round  the table with our bread end milk, the conversation turned on the joys  and sorrows of the world, I could not resist the temptation to inveigh  bitterly against ill-humour. \"We are apt,\" said I, \"to complain,  but--with very little cause, that our happy days are few, and our evil  days many. If our hearts were always disposed to receive the benefits  Heaven sends us, we should acquire strength to support evil when it  comes.\" \"But,\" observed the vicar's wife, \"we cannot always command our  tempers, so much depends upon the constitution: when the body suffers,  the mind is ill at ease.\" \"I acknowledge that,\" I continued; \"but we  must consider such a disposition in the light of a disease, and inquire  whether there is no remedy for it.\"    \"I should be glad to hear one,\" said Charlotte: \"at least, I think very  much depends upon ourselves; I know it is so with me. When anything  annoys me, and disturbs my temper, I hasten into the garden, hum a  couple of country dances, and it is all right with me directly.\" \"That  is what I meant,\" I replied; \"ill-humour resembles indolence: it is  natural to us; but if once we have courage to exert ourselves, we find  our work run fresh from our hands, and we experience in the activity  from which we shrank a real enjoyment.\" Frederica listened very  attentively: and the young man objected, that we were not masters of  ourselves, and still less so of our feelings. \"The question is about a  disagreeable feeling,\" I added, \"from which every one would willingly  escape, but none know their own power without trial. Invalids are glad  to consult physicians, and submit to the most scrupulous regimen, the  most nauseous medicines, in order to recover their health.\" I observed  that the good old man inclined his head, and exerted himself to hear our  discourse; so I raised my voice, and addressed myself directly to  him. \"We preach against a great many crimes,\" I observed, \"but I never  remember a sermon delivered against ill-humour.\" \"That may do very  well for your town clergymen,\" said he: \"country people are never  ill-humoured; though, indeed, it might be useful, occasionally, to my  wife for instance, and the judge.\" We all laughed, as did he likewise  very cordially, till he fell into a fit of coughing, which interrupted  our conversation for a time. Herr Schmidt resumed the subject. \"You  call ill humour a crime,\" he remarked, \"but I think you use too strong  a term.\" \"Not at all,\" I replied, \"if that deserves the name which is  so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbours. Is it not enough that we  want the power to make one another happy, must we deprive each other of  the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves? Show me the man who  has the courage to hide his ill-humour, who bears the whole burden  himself, without disturbing the peace of those around him. No:  ill-humour arises from an inward consciousness of our own want of merit,  from a discontent which ever accompanies that envy which foolish vanity  engenders. We see people happy, whom we have not made so, and cannot  endure the sight.\" Charlotte looked at me with a smile; she observed  the emotion with which I spoke: and a tear in the eyes of Frederica  stimulated me to proceed. \"Woe unto those,\" I said, \"who use their power  over a human heart to destroy the simple pleasures it would naturally  enjoy! All the favours, all the attentions, in the world cannot  compensate for the loss of that happiness which a cruel tyranny has  destroyed.\" My heart was full as I spoke. A recollection of many things  which had happened pressed upon my mind, and filled my eyes with tears.  \"We should daily repeat to ourselves,\" I exclaimed, \"that we should not  interfere with our friends, unless to leave them in possession of their  own joys, and increase their happiness by sharing it with them! But when  their souls are tormented by a violent passion, or their hearts  rent with grief, is it in your power to afford them the slightest  consolation?    \"And when the last fatal malady seizes the being whose untimely grave  you have prepared, when she lies languid and exhausted before you, her  dim eyes raised to heaven, and the damp of death upon her pallid brow,  there you stand at her bedside like a condemned criminal, with the  bitter feeling that your whole fortune could not save her; and the  agonising thought wrings you, that all your efforts are powerless to  impart even a moment's strength to the departing soul, or quicken her  with a transitory consolation.\"    At these words the remembrance of a similar scene at which I had been  once present fell with full force upon my heart. I buried my face in my  handkerchief, and hastened from the room, and was only recalled to my  recollection by Charlotte's voice, who reminded me that it was time to  return home. With what tenderness she chid me on the way for the too  eager interest I took in everything! She declared it would do me injury,  and that I ought to spare myself. Yes, my angel! I will do so for your  sake.    JULY 6.    She is still with her dying friend, and is still the same bright,  beautiful creature whose presence softens pain, and sheds happiness  around whichever way she turns. She went out yesterday with her little  sisters: I knew it, and went to meet them; and we walked together. In  about an hour and a half we returned to the town. We stopped at the  spring I am so fond of, and which is now a thousand times dearer to me  than ever. Charlotte seated herself upon the low wall, and we gathered  about her. I looked around, and recalled the time when my heart was  unoccupied and free. \"Dear fountain!\" I said, \"since that time I have no  more come to enjoy cool repose by thy fresh stream: I have passed thee  with careless steps, and scarcely bestowed a glance upon thee.\" I looked  down, and observed Charlotte's little sister, Jane, coming up the  steps with a glass of water. I turned toward Charlotte, and I felt her  influence over me. Jane at the moment approached with the glass. Her  sister, Marianne, wished to take it from her. \"No!\" cried the child,  with the sweetest expression of face, \"Charlotte must drink first.\"    The affection and simplicity with which this was uttered so charmed  me, that I sought to express"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25281"],[0,"Briefless Ballads and Legal Lyrics (#6)"],[1,"some bold advocate        Has dared to criticise my poem,      His name I have not learned, his fate        Will be a warning when I know him.                                      _Martial_, v. 33.      _In Postumum Causidicum_        No claim for trespass do I bring,      Or homicide, or poisoning.

Thou readest, sad one, of each ancient deed        Where thy unconquered sons their might displayed,        Afric and Egypt at thy feet were laid,        But slavery, not rule, is now thy meed.      What boots it that thou wast of old a queen,        And over foreign nations heldest rein,        If thou and all thy fame no more exist?      Forgive me, God, if all my days have been        Devoted to man's laws, unjust and vain        Unless Thy law within the heart be fixed.                                      _Cino da Pistoia._      JUSTICE        Ah! justice is a virtue bepraised and full of worth,      It castigates the sinner, and peoples all the earth,      And kings with care should guard it--instead they now forget      The gem that is most precious in all the coronet.      Some think they may do justice by cruelty, I wist;      But 'tis an evil counsel, for justice must consist      In showing deeds of mercy, in knowledge of the truth,      And executing judgment it executes with ruth.                                      _Pedro Lopez de Ayala._      THE POET AND THE ADVOCATE          Glory and gain thus mixed distract the thought,      We owe to honour all, to fortune nought;      The poet, like the soldier, scorns for pay      Peruvian gold, but seeks the wreath of bay.      How is the advocate the poet's peer?      The poet's glory is complete and clear;      He far outlives the advocate's renown,      Patru is e'en by Scarron's name weighed down.      The bar of Greece and Rome you point me out,      A bar that trained great men, I do not doubt,      For then chicane with language void of sense      Had not deformed the law and eloquence.      Purge the tribune of all this monstrous growth,      I mount it, and my soul will sink, though loth,      Will yield to fortune and will speak in prose.      But since reform in this so slowly grows,      Leave me my tastes, for I aspire to be      By verse ennobled to posterity,      To hold first place in arts above the law,      More grave and noble than it ever saw.      Fraud in this age of ours unpunished can      Tread down the equity so dear to man.      Can you for spirits just and generous find      A fairer cause to plead before mankind?      Mother or stepmother let Fortune be,      The theatre and not the bar for me;      For client virtue, truth for counsel's wage;      For judge the present and the coming age.                                      _Piron_, _La Metromanie_, Act iii.
