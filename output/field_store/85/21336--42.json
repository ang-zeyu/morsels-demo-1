CAROLINE.    So it is really! but then is it not the copper, instead of the acid,  that has combined with the iron blade?    MRS. B.    No; you are deceived by appearances: it is the acid which combines with  the iron, and, in so doing, deposits or precipitates the copper on the  surface of the blade.    EMILY.    But, cannot three or more substances combine together, without any of  them being precipitated?    MRS. B.    That is sometimes the case; but, in general, the stronger affinity  destroys the weaker; and it seldom happens that the attraction of  several substances for each other is so equally balanced as to produce  such complicated compounds.    CAROLINE.    But, pray, Mrs. B., what is the cause of the chemical attraction of  bodies for each other? It appears to me more extraordinary or unnatural,  if I may use the expression, than the attraction of cohesion, which  unites particles of a similar nature.    MRS. B.    Chemical attraction may, like that of cohesion or gravitation, be one of  the powers inherent in matter which, in our present state of knowledge,  admits of no other satisfactory explanation than an immediate reference  to a divine cause. Sir H. Davy, however, whose important discoveries  have opened such improved views in chemistry, has suggested an  hypothesis which may throw great light upon that science. He supposes  that there are two kinds of electricity, with one or other of which all  bodies are united. These we distinguish by the names of _positive_ and  _negative_ electricity; those bodies are disposed to combine, which  possess opposite electricities, as they are brought together by the  attraction which these electricities have for each other. But, whether  this hypothesis be altogether founded on truth or not, it is impossible  to question the great influence of electricity in chemical combinations.    EMILY.    So, that we must suppose that the two electricities always attract each  other, and thus compel the bodies in which they exist to combine?    CAROLINE.    And may not this be also the cause of the attraction of cohesion?    MRS. B.    No, for in particles of the same nature the same electricities must  prevail, and it is only the different or opposite electric fluids that  attract each other.    CAROLINE.    These electricities seem to me to be a kind of chemical spirit, which  animates the particles of bodies, and draws them together.    EMILY.    If it is known, then, with which of the electricities bodies are united,  it can be inferred which will, and which will not, combine together?    MRS. B.    Certainly. --I should not omit to mention, that some doubts have been  entertained whether electricity be really a material agent, or whether  it might not be a power inherent in bodies, similar to, or, perhaps  identical with, attraction.    EMILY.    But what then would be the electric spark which is visible, and must  therefore be really material?    MRS. B.    What we call the electric spark, may, Sir H. Davy says, be merely the  heat and light, or fire produced by the chemical combinations with which  these phenomena are always connected. We will not, however, enter more  fully on this important subject at present, but reserve the principal  facts which relate to it to a future conversation.    Before we part, however, I must recommend you to fix in your memory the  names of the simple bodies, against our next interview.          CONVERSATION II.    ON LIGHT AND HEAT OR CALORIC.      CAROLINE.    We have learned by heart the names of all the simple bodies which you  have enumerated, and we are now ready to enter on the examination of  each of them successively. You will begin, I suppose, with LIGHT?    MRS. B.    Respecting the nature of light we have little more than conjectures. It  is considered by most philosophers as a real substance, immediately  emanating from the sun, and from all luminous bodies, from which it is  projected in right lines with prodigious velocity. Light, however, being  imponderable, it cannot be confined and examined by itself; and  therefore it is to the effects it produces on other bodies, rather than  to its immediate nature, that we must direct our attention.    The connection between light and heat is very obvious; indeed, it is  such, that it is extremely difficult to examine the one independently of  the other.    EMILY.    But, is it possible to separate light from heat; I thought they were  only different degrees of the same thing, fire?    MRS. B.    I told you that fire was not now considered as a simple element. Whether  light and heat be altogether different agents, or not, I cannot pretend  to decide; but, in many cases, light may be separated from heat. The  first discovery of this was made by a celebrated Swedish chemist,  Scheele. Another very striking illustration of the separation of heat  and light was long after pointed out by Dr. Herschell. This philosopher  discovered that these two agents were emitted in the rays of the sun,  and that heat was less refrangible than light; for, in separating the  different coloured rays of light by a prism (as we did some time ago),  he found that the greatest heat was beyond the spectrum, at a little  distance from the red rays, which, you may recollect, are the least  refrangible.    EMILY.    I should like to try that experiment.    MRS. B.    It is by no means an easy one: the heat of a ray of light, refracted by  a prism, is so small, that it requires a very delicate thermometer to  distinguish the difference of the degree of heat within and without the  spectrum. For in this experiment the heat is not totally separated from  the light, each coloured ray retaining a certain portion of it, though  the greatest part is not sufficiently refracted to fall within the  spectrum.    EMILY.    I suppose, then, that those coloured rays which are the least  refrangible, retain the greatest quantity of heat?    MRS. B.    They do so.    EMILY.    Though I no longer doubt that light and heat can be separated, Dr.  Herschell's experiment does not appear to me to afford sufficient proof  that they are essentially different; for light, which you call a simple  body, may likewise be divided into the various coloured rays.    MRS. B.    No doubt there must be some difference in the various coloured rays.  Even their chemical powers are different. The blue rays, for instance,  have the greatest effect in separating oxygen from bodies, as was found  by Scheele; and there exist also, as Dr. Wollaston has shown, rays more  refrangible than the blue, which produce the same chemical effect, and,  what is very remarkable, are invisible.    EMILY.    Do you think it possible that heat may be merely a modification of  light?    MRS. B.    That is a supposition which, in the present state of natural philosophy,  can neither be positively affirmed nor denied. Let us, therefore,  instead of discussing theoretical points, be contented with examining  what is known respecting the chemical effects of light.    Light is capable of entering into a kind of transitory union with  certain substances, and this is what has been called phosphorescence.  Bodies that are possessed of this property, after being exposed to the  sun's rays, appear luminous in the dark. The shells of fish, the bones  of land animals, marble, limestone, and a variety of combinations of  earths, are more or less powerfully phosphorescent.    CAROLINE.    I remember being much surprised last summer with the phosphorescent  appearance of some pieces of rotten wood, which had just been dug out of  the ground; they shone so bright that I at first supposed them to be  glow-worms.    EMILY.    And is not the light of a glow-worm of a phosphorescent nature?    MRS. B.    It is a very remarkable instance of phosphorescence in living animals;  this property, however, is not exclusively possessed by the glow-worm.  The insect called the lanthorn-fly, which is peculiar to warm climates,  emits light as it flies, producing in the dark a remarkably sparkling  appearance. But it is more common to see animal matter in a dead state  possessed of a phosphorescent quality; sea fish is often eminently so.    EMILY.    I have heard that the sea has sometimes had the appearance of being  illuminated, and that the light is supposed to proceed from the spawn of  fishes floating on its surface.    MRS. B.    This light is probably owing to that or some other animal matter. Sea  water has been observed to become luminous from the substance of a fresh  herring having been immersed in it; and certain insects, of the Medusa  kind, are known to produce similar effects.    But the strongest phosphorescence is produced by chemical compositions  prepared for the purpose, the most common of which consists of oyster  shells and sulphur, and is known by the name of Canton's Phosphorus.    EMILY.    I am rather surprised, Mrs. B., that you should have said so much of the  light emitted by phosphorescent bodies without taking any notice of that  which is produced by burning bodies.    MRS. B.    The light emitted by the latter is so intimately connected with the  chemical history of combustion, that I must defer all explanation of it  till we come to the examination of that process, which is one of the  most interesting in chemical science.    Light is an agent capable of producing various chemical changes. It is  essential to the welfare both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms; for  men and plants grow pale and sickly if deprived of its salutary  influence. It is likewise remarkable for its property of destroying  colour, which renders it of great consequence in the process of  bleaching.    EMILY.    Is it not singular that light, which in studying optics we were taught  to consider as the source and origin of colours, should have also the  power of destroying them?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],[0,"Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#6)"],[1,"in New Zealand_.    We set out at some length some portions of the report submitted for our  consideration by the Minister of Justice, the Hon. Mr Marshall.  _Inter alia_, it is said:      I. _Objectionable Publications in General_        \"Our survey of the book trade disclosed that there were three types      of publication to which particular attention should be      given--comics, certain crime stories, and nudist and other      suggestive magazines.        (_a_) _Comics_: \"These are the publications which have attracted      most public attention, both here and overseas, and in particular      the type of comic known as the 'crime' or 'horror' comic has come      in for a great deal of severe criticism. It is true that reading of      a mildly bloodthirsty nature directed at the juvenile market is no      new thing. The comic books of today, however, are not those of a      generation ago, nor are they at all similar to the comic strips now      appearing in the newspapers. Many of them are full of matter which      is brutal, horrifying, and sadistic, and although to a certain      extent they are published for and read by adults of feeble      mentality they are also available to children.        \"The origin of this type of comic is the United States, but other      countries have not been slow to follow suit. Large numbers of      comics are reprinted in England and Australia from American plates.      The interim report of the Kefauver Committee strongly indicts crime      and horror comics and gives some revolting illustrations of their      contents. Reports indicate that comics almost as bad were      circulating in England before the introduction of legislation      there. The nature of crime comics circulating in Canada was      responsible for an Act passed there in 1949 prohibiting such      comics.        \"Even before the passing of last year's Act none of the comics on      sale in New Zealand was as bad as the worst American or English      examples. At the same time some of them were most objectionable.      Since action has been taken here and in Australia the standard of      comics distributed in New Zealand appears to have improved      considerably. That is not to say that they are all free from      objection, and there are a number of crime comics which we do not      think should be allowed to go on circulating. Indeed, we think that      this country can well do without the crime comic altogether.      Recently objection was taken to some forty comics, and we are      waiting advice from the distributors as to their attitude. Later in      this report we shall refer to further proposals for dealing with      comics.        (_b_) _Crime Stories_: \"The second class of publications referred      to comprises publications usually known as 'thrillers'. These books      are quite different from the ordinary detective novel and from the      more traditional type of thriller. Many examples of this new type      of gangster thriller have been flooding the New Zealand market in      the form of paper-backs selling at 2s. 6d. or less. They are      entirely devoid of literary or other merit and are devoted to the      wanton depiction in gross detail of brutality, violence, and sex.        \"These publications and a number of so-called detective magazines      which imitate them may perhaps be regarded as the adolescent      equivalent of the crime comic, and we believe them to be equally      harmful. Action against them will, we think, no more infringe the      principle of freedom of speech than action against narcotics      infringes the principle of free enterprise in the economic sphere.        \"Action against these publications was taken some time ago, and      some of the results of this action have appeared from recent      reports in the press. As an illustration of what has been done we      advised the Associated Booksellers that you considered all the      novels of Mickey Spillane to be indecent and that you were prepared      to prosecute in respect of them. The booksellers agreed with this      opinion and recommended their members not to stock these books. We      think it significant that these books, which were agreed to be      objectionable, were being sold by many reputable booksellers in New      Zealand. This shows how easy it is to offend unwittingly against      the Act.        \"There was a group of even more objectionable publications      published in paper-back form by an English firm, Milestone Ltd. We      advised the police some time ago that we intended to take      proceedings against any one found selling these books. The      Booksellers' Association agreed with this view.        \"There is an enormous output of books and paper-backs of the      detection-thriller type, and it is by no means easy to know where      to draw the line. It should be possible, however, to eliminate the      really harmful and leave the rest.        (_c_) _The Suggestive Magazine_: \"The third class of publications      is the suggestive magazine. Some public concern has been expressed      that a number of suggestive magazines are continuing to circulate      in this country. The truth is, however, that, although the names      are the same, the contents are very different. We have carefully      examined all these magazines, and, although they are not perhaps      very edifying, we are satisfied that at present none of them      clearly infringes the law.        \"Nudist magazines are another matter. Those we have seen appear      unobjectionable if their circulation is restricted to nudists and      persons interested in the nudist cult. They have, however, been      appearing in some newsagents' and tobacconists' shops and openly      displayed in windows, and we consider circulation in this form to      be undesirable. Serious consideration is being given to the      prosecution of any one who displays these magazines or sells them      to the general public.\"      II. _Suggested Amendments to the Law Relating to Indecent Publications._    The Justice Department has given much attention to the question as to  the efficacy of the amending Act introduced in 1954. We had the  advantage of reading the report presented by the Department to the  Minister of Justice, and we set out below certain portions of the  report which we as a Committee think worthy of notice. The report says,  _inter alia_:        \"(1) We think that the substantive changes made in the special      legislation in 1954 have been beneficial, and we strongly recommend      that they be retained. The Indecent Publications Act 1910, as it      previously stood, dealt with sex and with sex alone, and this is      not sufficient. It is, for instance, doubtful if the Spillane      novels or some of the books in the Milestone series could      successfully be objected to merely on grounds of sex; but they are,      nevertheless, of an immoral and mischievous tendency and should not      be allowed to continue in circulation. They might be described as      'sadistic' in the true psychological sense in that they combine sex      and violence.        \"There has been some suggestion that the Act leaves too vague just      what is indecent and that the word 'indecent' should be defined      with precision. In the nature of things there are, however, very      great difficulties in attempting such a definition. It is      significant that no precise definition of indecency exists either      in the principal Act or so far as we are aware in the legislation      of any other Commonwealth country.        \"The present state of affairs might be dangerous if prosecutions      could be taken on the decision of police officials in any town in      New Zealand. Whatever may be said in theory, however, the fact that      prosecutions can be brought only with the leave of the      Attorney-General is, we think, a sufficient guarantee that the law      will be applied uniformly and reasonably. Moreover, there is a      further safeguard in the right of appeal to the Supreme Court      against all decisions of a Magistrate under the Act.        \"We believe that the bookselling trade is quite happy with the      present substantive law as it is now being administered, and we      firmly hold the opinion that the best course is to leave the      substantive provisions of the 1954 Act largely as they are.        \"(2) The registration provisions are a rather complex way of      achieving their object, which is to enable the Court to put a      seller out of business if he is convicted of an offence against the      Act and if the Court believes his conduct is such as to warrant      this penalty. We think that this object could be achieved by giving      the Court this power directly. It could be provided that on      convicting any one under the Act the Court may make an order      prohibiting him for a certain period from carrying on the business      of selling books or periodicals. The provisions as to registration      could then be repealed.\"    Some members of the present Committee felt that this power should be  exercised only in the case of a second or subsequent conviction.        \"(3) The marking requirements of the Act are not well adapted to      their object, and, as we have mentioned, it has proved necessary to      a large extent to dispense with compliance with them. We think it      is anomalous that the law should continue to require marking while      almost every publication is exempted.        \"In place of the present marking provisions we suggest that every      New Zealand publisher should continue to be required to print his      name and address on what he publishes, that the importer of      overseas periodicals for sale or distribution be required to supply      to the Department of Justice a list of the titles imported by him,      and that every one other than a retail bookseller who carries on"]]]
