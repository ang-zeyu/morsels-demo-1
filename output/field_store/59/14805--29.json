Possibly  they will even do a little gardening together in the still  glowing evening.    If life has anything more to offer than this it will be found at  Holly House, where there are babies. Babies give an added  excitement to the master's homecoming, for almost anything may  have happened to them while he has been away. Dorothy perhaps has  cut a new tooth and Anne may have said something really clever  about the baker's man. In the morning, too, Anne will walk with  him to the end of the road; it is perfectly safe, for in Acacia  Road nothing untoward could occur. Even the dogs are quiet and  friendly. I like to think of the master of Holly House saying  good-bye to Anne at the end of the road and knowing that she will  be alive when he comes back in the evening. That ought to make  the day's work go quickly.    But it is the Cedars which gives us the secret of the happiness  of the suburbs. The Cedars you observe is a grander house  altogether; there is a tennis lawn at the back. And there are  grown-up sons and daughters at the Cedars. In such houses in  Acacia Road the delightful business of love-making is in full  swing. Marriages are not \"arranged\" in the suburbs; they grow  naturally out of the pleasant intercourse between the Cedars, the  Elms, and Rose Bank. I see Tom walking over to the Elms, racket  in hand, to play tennis with Miss Muriel. He is hoping for an  invitation to remain to supper, and indeed I think he will get  it. Anyhow he is going to ask Miss Muriel to come across to lunch  to-morrow; his mother has so much to talk to her about. But it  will be Tom who will do most of the talking.    I am sure that the marriages made in Acacia Road are happy. That  is why I have no fears for Holly House and Laburnum Lodge. Of  course they didn't make love in this Acacia Road; they are come  from the Acacia Road of some other suburb, wisely deciding that  they will be better away from their people. But they met each  other in the same way as Tom and Muriel are meeting; He has seen  Her in Her own home, in His home, at the tennis club, surrounded  by the young bounders (confound them!) of Turret Court and the  Wilderness; She has heard of him falling off his bicycle or  quarrelling with his father. Bless you, they know all about each  other; they are going to be happy enough together.    And now I think of it, why of course there is a local theatre  where they can do their play- going, if they are as keen on it as  that. For ten shillings they can spread from the stage box an air  of luxury and refinement over the house; and they can nod in an  easy manner across the stalls to the Cedars in the opposite box--  in the deep recesses of which Tom and Muriel, you may be sure,  are holding hands.          My Library      When I moved into a new house a few weeks ago, my books, as was  natural, moved with me. Strong, perspiring men shovelled them  into packing-cases, and staggered with them to the van, cursing  Caxton as they went. On arrival at this end, they staggered with  them into the room selected for my library, heaved off the lids  of the cases, and awaited orders. The immediate need was for an  emptier room. Together we hurried the books into the new white  shelves which awaited them, the order in which they stood being  of no matter so long as they were off the floor. Armful after  armful was hastily stacked, the only pause being when (in the  curious way in which these things happen) my own name suddenly  caught the eye of the foreman. \"Did you write this one, sir?\" he  asked. I admitted it. \"H'm,\" he said noncommittally. He glanced  along the names of every armful after that, and appeared a  little surprised at the number of books which I hadn't written.  An easy-going profession, evidently.    So we got the books up at last, and there they are still. I told  myself that when a wet afternoon came along I would arrange them  properly. When the wet afternoon came, I told myself that I would  arrange them one of these fine mornings. As they are now, I have  to look along every shelf in the search for the book which I  want. To come to Keats is no guarantee that we are on the road to  Shelley. Shelley, if he did not drop out on the way, is probably  next to How to Be a Golfer Though Middle-aged.    Having written as far as this, I had to get up and see where  Shelley really was. It is worse than I thought. He is between  Geometrical Optics and  Studies in New Zealand Scenery. Ella  Wheeler Wilcox, whom I find myself to be entertaining unawares,  sits beside Anarchy or Order, which was apparently \"sent in the  hope that you will become a member of the Duty and Discipline  Movement\"--a vain hope, it would seem, for I have not yet paid my  subscription. What I Found Out, by an English Governess, shares a  corner with The Recreations of a Country Parson; they are  followed by Villette and Baedeker's Switzerland. Something will  have to be done about it.  But I am wondering what is to be done. If I gave you the  impression that my books were precisely arranged in their old  shelves, I misled you. They were arranged in the order known as  \"all anyhow.\" Possibly they were a little less \"anyhow\" than they  are now, in that the volumes of any particular work were at least  together, but that is all that can be claimed for them. For years  I put off the business of tidying them up, just as I am putting  it off now. It is not laziness; it is simply that I don't know  how to begin.    Let us suppose that we decide to have all the poetry together. It  sounds reasonable. But then Byron is eleven inches high (my  tallest poet), and Beattie (my shortest) is just over four  inches. How foolish they will look standing side by side. Perhaps  you don't know Beattie, but I assure you that he was a poet. He  wrote those majestic lines:--      \"The shepherd-swain of whom I mention made     On Scotia's mountains fed his little flock;     The sickle, scythe or plough he never swayed--     An honest heart was almost all his stock.\"    Of course, one would hardly expect a shepherd to sway a plough in  the ordinary way, but Beattie  was quite right to remind us that  Edwin didn't either. Edwin was the name of the shepherd- swain.  \"And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy,\" we are told a little  further on in a line that should live. Well, having satisfied you  that Beattie was really a poet, I can now return to my argument  that an eleven-inch Byron cannot stand next to a four-inch  Beattie, and be followed by an eight-inch Cowper, without making  the shelf look silly. Yet how can I discard Beattie-- Beattie who  wrote:--    \"And now the downy cheek and deepened voice   Gave dignity to Edwin's blooming prime.\"    You see the difficulty. If you arrange your books according to  their contents you are sure to get an untidy shelf. If you  arrange your books according to their size and colour you get an  effective wall, but the poetically inclined visitor may lose  sight of Beattie altogether. Before, then, we decide what to do  about it, we must ask ourselves that very awkward question, \"Why  do we have books on our shelves at all?\" It is a most  embarrassing question to answer.    Of course, you think that the proper answer (in your own case) is  an indignant protest that you bought them in order to read them,  and that yon put them on your shelves in order that you could  refer to them when necessary. A little reflection will show you  what a stupid answer that is. If you only want to read them, why  are some of them bound in morocco and half-calf and other  expensive coverings? Why did you buy a first edition when a  hundredth edition was so much cheaper? Why have you got half a  dozen copies of The Rubaiyat? What is the particular value of  this other book that you treasure it so carefully? Why, the fact  that its pages are uncut. If you cut the pages and read it, the  value would go.    So, then, your library is not just for reference. You know as  well as I do that it furnishes your room; that it furnishes it  more effectively than does paint or mahogany or china. Of course,  it is nice to have the books there, so that one can refer to them  when one wishes. One may be writing an article on sea-bathing,  for instance, and have come to the sentence which begins: \"In the  well-remembered words of Coleridge, perhaps almost too familiar  to be quoted\"--and then one may have to look them up. On these  occasions a library is not only ornamental but useful. But do not  let us be ashamed that we find it ornamental. Indeed, the more I  survey it, the more I feel that my library is sufficiently  ornamental as it stands. Any reassembling of the books might  spoil the colour-scheme. Baedeker's Switzerland and Villette are  both in red, a colour which is neatly caught up again, after an  interlude in blue, by a volume of Browning and Jevons' Elementary  Logic. We had a woman here only yesterday who said, \"How pretty  your books look,\" and I am inclined to think that that is good  enough. There is a careless rapture about them which I should  lose if I started to arrange them methodically.    But perhaps I might risk this to the extent of getting all their  heads the same way up. Yes, on one of these fine days (or wet  nights) I shall take my library seriously in hand. There are  still one or two books which are the wrong way round. I shall put  them the right way round.          The Chase      The fact, as revealed in a recent lawsuit, that there is a  gentleman in this country who spends L10,000 a year upon his  butterfly collection would have disturbed me more in the early  nineties than it does to-day. I can bear it calmly now, but  twenty-five years ago the knowledge would have spoilt my pride in  my own collection, upon which I was already spending the best  part of threepence a week pocket-money.

'Que  voulez-vous, Madame? Children of bourgeois as well as of aristos were  often taken up by the State to be brought up as true patriots and no  longer pampered like so many lap-dogs.'    \"Three days later I received a letter from that inhuman monster, Jean  Paul Marat. He told me that he had taken my child away from me, not from  any idea of revenge for my disdain in the past, but from a spirit of  pure patriotism. My boy, he said, should not be brought up with the same  ideas of bourgeois effeteness and love of luxury which had disgraced the  nation for centuries. No! he should be reared amongst men who had  realised the true value of fraternity and equality and the ideal of  complete liberty for the individual to lead his own life, unfettered by  senseless prejudices of education and refinement. Which means,  Monsieur,\" the poor woman went on with passionate misery, \"that my child  is to be reared up in the company of all that is most vile and most  degraded in the disease-haunted slums of indigent Paris; that, with the  connivance of that execrable fiend Marat, my only son will, mayhap, come  back to me one day a potential thief, a criminal probably, a  drink-sodden reprobate at best. Such things are done every day in this  glorious Revolution of ours--done in the sacred name of France and of  Liberty. And the moral murder of my child is to be my punishment for  daring to turn a deaf ear to the indign passion of a brute!\"    Once more she paused, and when the melancholy echo of her broken voice  had died away in the narrow room, not another murmur broke the stillness  of this far-away corner of the great city.    The man did not move. He stood looking down upon the poor woman before  him, a world of pity expressed in his deep-set eyes. Through the  absolute silence around there came the sound as of a gentle flutter, the  current of cold air, mayhap, sighing through the ill-fitting shutters,  or the soft, weird soughing made by unseen things. The man's heart was  full of pity, and it seemed as if the Angel of Compassion had come at  his bidding and enfolded the sorrowing woman with his wings.    A moment or two later she was able to finish her pathetic narrative.    \"Do you marvel, Monsieur,\" she said, \"that I am still sane--still alive?  But I only live to find my child. I try and keep my reason in order to  fight the devilish cunning of a brute on his own ground. Up to now all  my inquiries have been in vain. At first I squandered money, tried  judicial means, set an army of sleuth-hounds on the track. I tried  bribery, corruption. I went to the wretch himself and abased myself in  the dust before him. He only laughed at me and told me that his love for  me had died long ago; he now was lavishing its treasures upon the  faithful friend and companion--that awful woman, Simonne Evrard--who had  stood by him in the darkest hours of his misfortunes. Then it was that I  decided to adopt different tactics. Since my child was to be reared in  the midst of murderers and thieves, I, too, would haunt their abodes. I  became a street-singer, dancer, what you will. I wear rags now and  solicit alms. I haunt the most disreputable cabarets in the lowest slums  of Paris. I listen and I spy; I question every man, woman, and child who  might afford some clue, give me some indication. There is hardly a house  in these parts that I have not visited and whence I have not been kicked  out as an importunate beggar or worse. Gradually I am narrowing the  circle of my investigations. Presently I shall get a clue. I shall! I  know I shall! God cannot allow this monstrous thing to go on!\"    Again there was silence. The poor woman had completely broken down.  Shame, humiliation, passionate grief, had made of her a mere miserable  wreckage of humanity.    The man waited awhile until she was composed, then he said simply:    \"You have suffered terribly, Madame; but chiefly, I think, because you  have been alone in your grief. You have brooded over it until it has  threatened your reason. Now, if you will allow me to act as your friend,  I will pledge you my word that I will find your son for you. Will you  trust me sufficiently to give up your present methods and place yourself  entirely in my hands? There are more than a dozen gallant gentlemen, who  are my friends, and who will help me in my search. But for this I must  have a free hand, and only help from you when I require it. I can find  you lodgings where you will be quite safe under the protection of my  wife, who is as like an angel as any man or woman I have ever met on  this earth. When your son is once more in your arms, you will, I hope,  accompany us to England, where so many of your friends have already  found a refuge. If this meets with your approval, Madame, you may  command me, for with your permission I mean to be your most devoted  servant.\"    Dante, in his wild imaginations of hell and of purgatory and fleeting  glimpses of paradise, never put before us the picture of a soul that was  lost and found heaven, after a cycle of despair. Nor could Madeleine  Lannoy ever explain her feelings at that moment, even to herself. To  begin with, she could not quite grasp the reality of this ray of hope,  which came to her at the darkest hour of her misery. She stared at the  man before her as she would on an ethereal vision; she fell on her knees  and buried her face in her hands.    What happened afterwards she hardly knew; she was in a state of  semi-consciousness. When she once more woke to reality, she was in  comfortable lodgings; she moved and talked and ate and lived like a  human being. She was no longer a pariah, an outcast, a poor,  half-demented creature, insentient save for an infinite capacity for  suffering. She suffered still, but she no longer despaired. There had  been such marvellous power and confidence in that man's voice when he  said: \"I pledge you my word.\" Madeleine Lannoy lived now in hope and a  sweet sense of perfect mental and bodily security. Around her there was  an influence, too, a presence which she did not often see, but always  felt to be there: a woman, tall and graceful and sympathetic, who was  always ready to cheer, to comfort, and to help. Her name was Marguerite.  Madame Lannoy never knew her by any other. The man had spoken of her as  being as like an angel as could be met on this earth, and poor Madeleine  Lannoy fully agreed with him.      III    Even that bloodthirsty tiger, Jean Paul Marat, has had his apologists.  His friends have called him a martyr, a selfless and incorruptible  exponent of social and political ideals. We may take it that Simonne  Evrard loved him, for a more impassioned obituary speech was, mayhap,  never spoken than the one which she delivered before the National  Assembly in honour of that sinister demagogue, whose writings and  activities will for ever sully some of the really fine pages of that  revolutionary era.    But with those apologists we have naught to do. History has talked its  fill of the inhuman monster. With the more intimate biographists alone  has this true chronicle any concern. It is one of these who tells us  that on or about the eighteenth day of Messidor, in the year I of the  Republic (a date which corresponds with the sixth of July, 1793, of our  own calendar), Jean Paul Marat took an additional man into his service,  at the instance of Jeannette Marechal, his cook and maid-of-all-work.  Marat was at this time a martyr to an unpleasant form of skin disease,  brought on by the terrible privations which he had endured during the  few years preceding his association with Simonne Evrard, the faithful  friend and housekeeper, whose small fortune subsequently provided him  with some degree of comfort.    The man whom Jeannette Marechal, the cook, introduced into the household  of No. 30, Rue des Cordeliers, that worthy woman had literally picked  one day out of the gutter where he was grabbing for scraps of food like  some wretched starving cur. He appeared to be known to the police of the  section, his identity book proclaiming him to be one Paul Mole, who had  served his time in gaol for larceny. He professed himself willing to do  any work required of him, for the merest pittance and some kind of roof  over his head. Simonne Evrard allowed Jeannette to take him in, partly  out of compassion and partly with a view to easing the woman's own  burden, the only other domestic in the house--a man named Bas--being  more interested in politics and the meetings of the Club des Jacobins  than he was in his master's ailments. The man Mole, moreover, appeared  to know something of medicine and of herbs and how to prepare the warm  baths which alone eased the unfortunate Marat from pain. He was  powerfully built, too, and though he muttered and grumbled a great deal,  and indulged in prolonged fits of sulkiness, when he would not open his  mouth to anyone, he was, on the whole, helpful and good-tempered.    There must also have been something about his whole wretched personality  which made a strong appeal to the \"Friend of the People,\" for it is  quite evident that within a few days Paul Mole had won no small measure  of his master's confidence.    Marat, sick, fretful, and worried, had taken an unreasoning dislike to  his servant Bas. He was thankful to have a stranger about him, a man who  was as miserable as he himself had been a very little while ago; who,  like himself, had lived in cellars and in underground burrows, and lived  on the scraps of food which even street-curs had disdained.    On the seventh day following Mole's entry into the household, and while  the latter was preparing his employer's bath, Marat said abruptly to  him:    \"You'll go as far as the Chemin de Pantin to-day for me, citizen. You  know your way?\"    \"I can find it, what?\" muttered Mole, who appeared to be in one of his"]]]
