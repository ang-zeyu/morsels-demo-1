Among my earliest recollections, is her  devoting much time to a thorough examination of the evidences of  Christianity, and ultimately declaring that to her, better than all  arguments or usual processes of proof, was the soul's want of a divine  religion, and the voice within that soul which declared the teachings  of Christ to be true and from God; and one of my most cherished  possessions is that Bible which she so diligently and thoughtfully  read, and which bears, in her own handwriting, so many proofs of  discriminating and prayerful perusal. As in regard to reformatory  movements so here, she joined no organized body of believers,  sympathizing with all of them whose views were noble and Christian;  deploring and bearing faithful testimony against anything she deemed  narrowness or perversion in theology or life.    This volume from her hand is now before the reader. The fact that a  large share of it was never written or revised by its authoress for  publication will be kept in view, as explaining any inaccuracy of  expression or repetition of thought, should such occur in its pages.  Nor will it be deemed surprising, if, in papers written by so  progressive a person, at so various periods of life, and under  widely-varied circumstances, there should not always be found perfect  union as to every expressed opinion.    It is probable that this will soon be followed by another volume,  containing a republication of \"Summer on the Lakes,\" and also the  \"Letters from Europe,\" by the same hand.    In the preparation of this volume much valuable assistance has been  afforded by Mr. Greeley, of the New York _Tribune_, who has been  earnest in his desire and efforts for the diffusion of what Margaret  has written.    A. B. F.    BOSTON, _May 10th_, 1855.          INTRODUCTION.           *       *       *       *       *    The problem of Woman's position, or \"sphere,\"--of her duties,  responsibilities, rights and immunities as Woman,--fitly attracts a  large and still-increasing measure of attention from the thinkers and  agitators of our time, The legislators, so called,--those who  ultimately enact into statutes what the really governing class (to  wit, the thinkers) have originated, matured and gradually commended to  the popular comprehension and acceptance,--are not as yet much  occupied with this problem, only fitfully worried and more or less  consciously puzzled by it. More commonly they merely echo the mob's  shallow retort to the petition of any strong-minded daughter or  sister, who demands that she be allowed a voice in disposing of the  money wrenched from her hard earnings by inexorable taxation, or in  shaping the laws by which she is ruled, judged, and is liable to be  sentenced to prison or to death, \"It is a woman's business to obey her  husband, keep his home tidy, and nourish and train his children.\" But  when she rejoins to this, \"Very true; but suppose I choose not to have  a husband, or am not chosen for a wife--what then? I am still subject  to your laws. Why am I not entitled, as a rational human being, to a  voice in shaping them? I have physical needs, and must somehow earn a  living. Why should I not be at liberty to earn it in any honest and  useful calling?\"--the mob's flout is hushed, and the legislator Is  struck dumb also. They were already at the end of their scanty  resources of logic, and it would be cruel for woman to ask further:  \"Suppose me a wife, and my husband a drunken prodigal--what am I to do  then? May I not earn food for my babes without being exposed to have  it snatched from their mouths to replenish the rumseller's till, and  aggravate my husband's madness? If some sympathizing relative sees fit  to leave me a bequest wherewith to keep my little ones together, why  may I not be legally enabled to secure this to their use and benefit?  In short, why am I not regarded by the law as a _soul_, responsible  for my acts to God and humanity, and not as a mere body, devoted to the  unreasoning service of my husband?\" The state gives no answer, and the  champions of her policy evince wisdom in imitating her silence.    The writer of the following pages was one of the earliest as well as  ablest among American women, to demand for her sex equality before the  law with her titular lord and master, Her writings on this subject  have the force which springs from the ripening of profound reflection  into assured conviction. She wrote as one who had observed, and who  deeply felt what she deliberately uttered. Others have since spoken  more fluently, more variously, with a greater affluence of  illustration; but none, it is believed, more earnestly or more  forcibly. It is due to her memory, as well as to the great and living  cause of which she was so eminent and so fearless an advocate, that  what she thought and said with regard to the position of her sex and  its limitations, should be fully and fairly placed before the public.  For several years past her principal essay on \"Woman,\" here given, has  not been purchasable at any price, and has only with great difficulty  been accessible to the general reader. To place it within the reach of  those who need and require it, is the main impulse to the publication  of this volume; but the accompanying essays and papers will be found  equally worthy of thoughtful consideration.

It is in compliance with wishes expressed from many quarters that it  is prepared for publication in its present form.    Objections having been made to the former title, as not sufficiently  easy to be understood, the present has been substituted as expressive  of the main purpose of the essay; though, by myself, the other is  preferred, partly for the reason others do not like it,--that is, that  it requires some thought to see what it means, and might thus prepare  the reader to meet me on my own ground. Besides, it offers a larger  scope, and is, in that way, more just to my desire. I meant by that  title to intimate the fact that, while it is the destiny of Man, in  the course of the ages, to ascertain and fulfil the law of his being,  so that his life shall be seen, as a whole, to be that of an angel or  messenger, the action of prejudices and passions which attend, in the  day, the growth of the individual, is continually obstructing the holy  work that is to make the earth a part of heaven. By Man I mean both  man and woman; these are the two halves of one thought. I lay no  especial stress on the welfare of either. I believe that the  development of the one cannot be effected without that of the other.  My highest wish is that this truth should be distinctly and rationally  apprehended, and the conditions of life and freedom recognized as the  same for the daughters and the sons of time; twin exponents of a  divine thought.    I solicit a sincere and patient attention from those who open the  following pages at all. I solicit of women that they will lay it to  heart to ascertain what is for them the liberty of law. It is for  this, and not for any, the largest, extension of partial privileges  that I seek. I ask them, if interested by these suggestions, to search  their own experience and intuitions for better, and fill up with fit  materials the trenches that hedge them in. From men I ask a noble and  earnest attention to anything that can be offered on this great and  still obscure subject, such as I have met from many with whom I stand  in private relations.    And may truth, unpolluted by prejudice, vanity or selfishness, be  granted daily more and more as the due of inheritance, and only  valuable conquest for us all!    _November_, 1844.                WOMAN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Frailty, thy name is WOMAN.\"    \"The Earth waits for her Queen.\"      The connection between these quotations may not be obvious, but it is  strict. Yet would any contradict us, if we made them applicable to the  other side, and began also,      Frailty, thy name is MAN.    The Earth waits for its King?      Yet Man, if not yet fully installed in his powers, has given much  earnest of his claims. Frail he is indeed,--how frail! how impure!  Yet often has the vein of gold displayed itself amid the baser ores,  and Man has appeared before us in princely promise worthy of his  future.    If, oftentimes, we see the prodigal son feeding on the husks in the  fair field no more his own, anon we raise the eyelids, heavy from  bitter tears, to behold in him the radiant apparition of genius and  love, demanding not less than the all of goodness, power "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#2)"],[1,"in which it was flung out.    \"To save trouble and to frighten the others. It needs two overseers to  drag a man's body up to the top deck; and if the men at the lower deck  oars were left alone, of course they'd stop rowing and try to pull up the  benches by all standing up together in their chains.\"    \"You've a most provident imagination. Where have you been reading about  galleys and galley-slaves?\"    \"Nowhere that I remember. I row a little when I get the chance. But,  perhaps, if you say so, I may have read something.\"    He went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers, and I wondered  how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate  abundance of detail, all given with absolute assurance, the story of  extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure, riot, piracy, and death in unnamed  seas. He had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt against the  overseers, to command of a ship of his own, and ultimate establishment of  a kingdom on an island \"somewhere in the sea, you know\"; and, delighted  with my paltry five pounds, had gone out to buy the notions of other men,  that these might teach him how to write. I had the consolation of knowing  that this notion was mine by right of purchase, and I thought that I could  make something of it.    When next he came to me he was drunk--royally drunk on many poets for the  first time revealed to him. His pupils were dilated, his words tumbled  over each other, and he wrapped himself in quotations. Most of all was he  drunk with Longfellow.    \"Isn't it splendid? Isn't it superb?\" he cried, after hasty greetings.  \"Listen to this--      \"'Wouldst thou,'--so the helmsman answered,       'Know the secret of the sea?     Only those who brave its dangers       Comprehend its mystery.'\"    By gum!      \"'Only those who brave its dangers       Comprehend its mystery,'\"    he repeated twenty times, walking up and down the room and forgetting me.  \"But _I_ can understand it too,\" he said to himself. \"I don't know how to  thank you for that fiver, And this; listen--      \"'I remember the black wharves and the ships       And the sea-tides tossing free,     And the Spanish sailors with bearded lips,     And the beauty and mystery of the ships,       And the magic of the sea.'\"    I haven't braved any dangers, but I feel as if I knew all about it.\"    \"You certainly seem to have a grip of the sea. Have you ever seen it?\"    \"When I was a little chap I went to Brighton once; we used to live in  Coventry, though, before we came to London. I never saw it,      \"'When descends on the Atlantic     The gigantic     Storm-wind of the Equinox.'\"    He shook me by the shoulder to make me understand the passion that was  shaking himself.    \"When that storm comes,\" he continued, \"I think that all the oars in the  ship that I was talking about get broken, and the rowers have their chests  smashed in by the bucking oar-heads. By the way, have you done anything  with that notion of mine yet?\"    \"No. I was waiting to hear more of it from you. Tell me how in the world  you're so certain about the fittings of the ship. You know nothing of  ships.\"    \"I don't know. It's as real as anything to me until I try to write it  down. I was thinking about it only last night in bed, after you had loaned  me 'Treasure Island'; and I made up a whole lot of new things to go into  the story.\"    \"What sort of things?\"    \"About the food the men ate; rotten figs and black beans and wine in a  skin bag, passed from bench to bench.\"    \"Was the ship built so long ago as _that_?\"    \"As what? I don't know whether it was long ago or not. It's only a notion,  but sometimes it seems just as real as if it was true. Do I bother you  with talking about it?\"    \"Not in the least. Did you make up anything else?\"    \"Yes, but it's nonsense.\" Charlie flushed a little.    \"Never mind; let's hear about it.\"    \"Well, I was thinking over the story, and after awhile I got out of bed  and wrote down on a piece of paper the sort of stuff the men might be  supposed to scratch on their oars with the edges of their handcuffs. It  seemed to make the thing more lifelike. It _is_ so real to me, y'know.\"    \"Have you the paper on you?\"    \"Ye-es, but what's the use of showing it? It's only a lot of scratches.  All the same, we might have 'em reproduced in the book on the front page.\"    \"I'll attend to those details. Show me what your men wrote.\"    He pulled out of his pocket a sheet of note-paper, with a single line of  scratches upon it, and I put this carefully away.    \"What is it supposed to mean in English?\" I said.    \"Oh, I don't know. Perhaps it means 'I'm beastly tired.' It's great  nonsense,\" he repeated, \"but all those men in the ship seem as real as  people to me. Do do something to the notion soon; I should like to see it  written and printed.\"    \"But all you've told me would make a long book.\"    \"Make it then. You've only to sit down and write it out.\"    \"Give me a little time. Have you any more notions?\"    \"Not just now. I'm reading all the books I've bought. They're splendid.\"    When he had left I looked at the sheet of note-paper with the inscription  upon it. Then I took my head tenderly between both hands, to make certain  that it was not coming off or turning round. Then ... but there seemed to  be no interval between quitting my rooms and finding myself arguing with a  policeman outside a door marked _Private_ in a corridor of the British  Museum. All I demanded, as politely as possible, was \"the Greek antiquity  man.\" The policeman knew nothing except the rules of the Museum, and it  became necessary to forage through all the houses and offices inside the  gates. An elderly gentleman called away from his lunch put an end to my  search by holding the note-paper between finger and thumb and sniffing at  it scornfully.    \"What does this mean? H'mm,\" said he. \"So far as I can ascertain it is an  attempt to write extremely corrupt Greek on the part\"--here he glared at  me with intention--\"of an extremely illiterate--ah--person.\" He read  slowly from the paper, \"_Pollock, Erckmann, Tauchnitz, Henniker_\"-four  names familiar to me.    \"Can you tell me what the corruption is supposed to mean--the gist of the  thing?\" I asked.    \"I have been--many times--overcome with weariness in this particular  employment. That is the meaning.\" He returned me the paper, and I fled  without a word of thanks, explanation, or apology.    I might have been excused for forgetting much. To me of all men had been  given the chance to write the most marvelous tale in the world, nothing  less than the story of a Greek galley-slave, as told by himself. Small  wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to Charlie. The Fates that are so  careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had, in this  case, been neglectful, and Charlie was looking, though that he did not  know, where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge since  Time began. Above all, he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to  me for five pounds; and he would retain that ignorance, for bank-clerks do  not understand metempsychosis, and a sound commercial education does not  include Greek. He would supply me--here I capered among the dumb gods of  Egypt and laughed in their battered faces--with material to make my tale  sure--so sure that the world would hail it as an impudent and vamped  fiction. And I--I alone would know that it was absolutely and literally  true. I--I alone held this jewel to my hand for the cutting and polishing.  Therefore I danced again among the gods till a policeman saw me and took  steps in my direction.    It remained now only to encourage Charlie to talk, and here there was no  difficulty. But I had forgotten those accursed books of poetry. He came to  me time after time, as useless as a surcharged phonograph--drunk on Byron,  Shelley, or Keats. Knowing now what the boy had been in his past lives,  and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble, I could not  hide from him my respect and interest. He misconstrued both into respect  for the present soul of Charlie Mears, to whom life was as new as it was  to Adam, and interest in his readings; and stretched my patience to  breaking point by reciting poetry--not his own now, but that of others. I  wished every English poet blotted out of the memory of mankind. I  blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn Charlie from  the path of direct narrative, and would, later, spur him to imitate them;  but I choked down my impatience until the first flood of enthusiasm should  have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams.    \"What's the use of my telling you what _I_ think, when these chaps wrote  things for the angels to read?\" he growled, one evening. \"Why don't you  write something like theirs?\"    \"I don't think you're treating me quite fairly,\" I said, speaking under  strong restraint.    \"I've given you the story,\" he said, shortly, replunging into \"Lara.\"    \"But I want the details.\"    \"The things I make up about that damned ship that you call a galley?  They're quite easy. You can just make 'em up yourself. Turn up the gas a  little, I want to go on reading.\"    I could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing stupidity.  I could indeed make up things for myself did I only know what Charlie did  not know that he knew. But since the doors were shut behind me I could  only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him in good temper. One  minute's want of guard might spoil a priceless revelation; now and again  he would toss his books aside--he kept them in my rooms, for his mother  would have been shocked at the waste of good money had she seen them--and  launched into his sea dreams, Again I cursed all the poets of England. The  plastic mind of the bank-clerk had been overlaid, colored and distorted by  that which he had read, and the result as delivered was a"]]]
