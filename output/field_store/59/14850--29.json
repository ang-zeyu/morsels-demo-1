The house stood at the end of the village that was nearest the station,  and thus, when the panorama of her kingdom opened before her, she had  but a few steps further to go. A yew-hedge, bought entire from a  neighboring farm, and transplanted with solid lumps of earth and  indignant snails around its roots, separated the small oblong of garden  from the road, and cast monstrous shadows of the shapes into which it  was cut, across the little lawns inside. Here, as was only right and  proper, there was not a flower to be found save such as were mentioned  in the plays of Shakespeare; indeed it was called Shakespeare's garden,  and the bed that ran below the windows of the dining room was Ophelia's  border, for it consisted solely of those flowers which that distraught  maiden distributed to her friends when she should have been in a  lunatic asylum. Mrs Lucas often reflected how lucky it was that such  institutions were unknown in Elizabeth's day, or that, if known,  Shakespeare artistically ignored their existence. Pansies, naturally,  formed the chief decoration--though there were some very flourishing  plants of rue. Mrs Lucas always wore a little bunch of them when in  flower, to inspire her thoughts, and found them wonderfully  efficacious. Round the sundial, which was set in the middle of one of  the squares of grass between which a path of broken paving-stone led to  the front door, was a circular border, now, in July, sadly vacant, for  it harboured only the spring-flowers enumerated by Perdita. But the  first day every year when Perdita's border put forth its earliest  blossom was a delicious anniversary, and the news of it spread like  wild-fire through Mrs Lucas's kingdom, and her subjects were very  joyful, and came to salute the violet or daffodil, or whatever it was.    The three cottages dexterously transformed into The Hurst, presented a  charmingly irregular and picturesque front. Two were of the grey stone  of the district and the middle one, to the door of which led the paved  path, of brick and timber; latticed windows with stone mullions gave  little light to the room within, and certain new windows had been  added; these could be detected by the observant eye for they had a  markedly older appearance than the rest. The front-door, similarly,  seemed as if it must have been made years before the house, the fact  being that the one which Mrs Lucas had found there was too dilapidated  to be of the slightest service in keeping out wind or wet or undesired  callers. She had therefore caused to be constructed an even older one  made from the oak-planks of a dismantled barn, and had it studded with  large iron nails of antique pattern made by the village blacksmith. He  had arranged some of them to look as if they spelled A.D. 1603. Over  the door hung an inn-sign, and into the space where once the sign had  swung was now inserted a lantern, in which was ensconced, well hidden  from view by its patinated glass sides, an electric light. This was one  of the necessary concessions to modern convenience, for no lamp  nurtured on oil would pierce those genuinely opaque panes, and  illuminate the path to the gate. Better to have an electric light than  cause your guests to plunge into Perdita's border. By the side of this  fortress-door hung a heavy iron bell-pull, ending in a mermaid. When  first Mrs Lucas had that installed, it was a bell-pull in the sense  that an extremely athletic man could, if he used both hands and planted  his feet firmly, cause it to move, so that a huge bronze bell swung in  the servants' passage and eventually gave tongue (if the athlete  continued pulling) with vibrations so sonorous that the white-wash from  the ceiling fell down in flakes. She had therefore made another  concession to the frailty of the present generation and the  inconveniences of having whitewash falling into salads and puddings on  their way to the dining room, and now at the back of the mermaid's tail  was a potent little bone button, coloured black and practically  invisible, and thus the bell-pull had been converted into an electric  bell-push. In this way visitors could make their advent known without  violent exertion, the mermaid lost no visible whit of her Elizabethan  virginity, and the spirit of Shakespeare wandering in his garden would  not notice any anachronism. He could not in fact, for there was none to  notice.    Though Mrs Lucas's parents had bestowed the name of Emmeline on her, it  was not to be wondered at that she was always known among the more  intimate of her subjects as Lucia, pronounced, of course, in the  Italian mode--La Lucia, the wife of Lucas; and it was as \"Lucia mia\"  that her husband hailed her as he met her at the door of The Hurst.    He had been watching for her arrival from the panes of the parlour  while he meditated upon one of the little prose poems which formed so  delectable a contribution to the culture of Riseholme, for though, as  had been hinted, he had in practical life a firm grasp of the obvious,  there were windows in his soul which looked out onto vague and ethereal  prospects which so far from being obvious were only dimly intelligible.  In form these odes were cast in the loose rhythms of Walt Whitman, but  their smooth suavity and their contents bore no resemblance whatever to  the productions of that barbaric bard, whose works were quite unknown  in Riseholme. Already a couple of volumes of these prose-poems had been  published, not of course in the hard business-like establishment of  London, but at \"Ye Sign of ye Daffodil,\" on the village green, where  type was set up by hand, and very little, but that of the best, was  printed. The press had only been recently started at Mr Lucas's  expense, but it had put forth a reprint of Shakespeare's sonnets  already, as well as his own poems. They were printed in blunt type on  thick yellowish paper, the edges of which seemed as if they had been  cut by the forefinger of an impatient reader, so ragged and irregular  were they, and they were bound in vellum, the titles of these two slim  flowers of poetry, \"Flotsam\" and \"Jetsam,\" were printed in black letter  type and the covers were further adorned with a sort of embossed seal  and with antique looking tapes so that you could tie it all up with two  bows when you had finished with Mr Lucas's \"Flotsam\" for the time  being, and turned to untie the \"Jetsam.\"    Today the prose-poem of \"Loneliness\" had not been getting on very well,  and Philip Lucas was glad to hear the click of the garden-gate, which  showed that his loneliness was over for the present, and looking up he  saw his wife's figure waveringly presented to his eyes through the  twisted and knotty glass of the parlour window, which had taken so long  to collect, but which now completely replaced the plain, commonplace  unrefracting stuff which was there before. He jumped up with an  alacrity remarkable in so solid and well-furnished a person, and had  thrown open the nail-studded front-door before Lucia had traversed the  path of broken paving-stones, for she had lingered for a sad moment at  Perdita's empty border.    \"_Lucia mia_!\" he exclaimed. \"_Ben arrivata_! So you walked  from the station?\"    \"_Si, Peppino, mio caro_,\" she said. \"_Sta bene_?\"    He kissed her and relapsed into Shakespeare's tongue, for their  Italian, though firm and perfect as far as it went, could not be  considered as going far, and was useless for conversational purposes,  unless they merely wanted to greet each other, or to know the time. But  it was interesting to talk Italian, however little way it went.    \"_Molto bene_,\" said he, \"and it's delightful to have you home  again. And how was London?\" he asked in the sort of tone in which he  might have enquired after the health of a poor relation, who was not  likely to recover. She smiled rather sadly.    \"Terrifically busy about nothing,\" she said. \"All this fortnight I have  scarcely had a moment to myself. Lunches, dinners, parties of all  kinds; I could not go to half the gatherings I was bidden to. Dear good  South Kensington! Chelsea too!\"    \"_Carissima_, when London does manage to catch you, it is no  wonder it makes the most of you,\" he said. \"You mustn't blame London  for that.\"    \"No, dear, I don't. Everyone was tremendously kind and hospitable; they  all did their best. If I blame anyone, I blame myself. But I think this  Riseholme life with its finish and its exquisiteness spoils one for  other places. London is like a railway-junction: it has no true life of  its own. There is no delicacy, no appreciation of fine shades.  Individualism has no existence there; everyone gabbles together,  gabbles and gobbles: am not I naughty? If there is a concert in a  private house--you know my views about music and the impossibility of  hearing music at all if you are stuck in the middle of a row of  people--even then, the moment it is over you are whisked away to supper,  or somebody wants to have a few words. There is always a crowd, there is  always food, you cannot be alone, and it is only in loneliness, as  Goethe says, that your perceptions put forth their flowers. No one in  London has time to listen: they are all thinking about who is there and  who isn't there, and what is the next thing. The exquisite present, as  you put it in one of your poems, has no existence there: it is always  the feverish future.\"    \"Delicious phrase! I should have stolen that gem for my poor poems, if  you had discovered it before.\"    She was too much used to this incense to do more than sniff it in  unconsciously, and she went on with her tremendous indictment.    \"It isn't that I find fault with London for being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#2)"],[1," and feeling, have been revealed  to the eyes of scholars by Mr. Grote's searching criticism, like  new forms of animated nature by the microscope.\"    The general character of the work has been farther well summed  up by Sir Archibald Alison. He says: \"A decided liberal, perhaps  even a republican, in politics, Mr. Grote has labored to counteract  the influence of Mitford in Grecian history, and construct a  history of Greece from authentic materials, which should illustrate  the animating influence of democratic freedom upon the exertions  of the human mind. In the prosecution of this attempt he has  displayed an extent of learning, a variety of research, a power  of combination, which are worthy of the very highest praise, and  have secured for him a lasting place among the historians of modern  Europe.\"    We may also mention, in this connection, the valuable and scholarly  work of the German professor, Ernst Curtius (1857-'67), in five  volumes, translated by A. Ward (1871-'74). His sympathies are  monarchical, and his views more nearly accord with those of Mitford  and Thirlwall than with those of Grote.    The work by William Smith, in one volume, 1865, is an excellent  summary of Grecian history, as is also that of George W. Cox, 1876.  The former work, which to a considerable extent is an abridgment  of Grote, has been brought down, in a Boston edition, from the  Roman Conquest to the middle of the present century, by Dr. Felton,  late President of Harvard College. President Felton has also  published two volumes of scholarly lectures on Ancient and Modern  Greece (1867).    The works devoted to limited periods of Grecian history and special  departments of research are very numerous. Among the most valuable  of the former is the History of the Peloponnesian War, by the  Greek historian Thucydides, of which there are several English  versions. He was born in Athens, about the year 471 B.C. His is  one of the ablest histories ever written.    Herodotus, the earliest and best of the romantic historians,  sometimes called the \"Father of History,\" was contemporary with  Thucydides. He wrote, in a charming style, an elaborate work on  the Persian and Grecian wars, most of the scenes of which he  visited in person; and in numerous episodes and digressions he  interweaves the most valuable history that we have of the early  Asiatic nations and the Egyptians; but he indulges too much in  the marvelous to be altogether reliable.\"    Of the numerous works of Xenophon, an Athenian who is sometimes  called the \"Attic Muse,\" from the simplicity and beauty of his  style, the best known and the most pleasing are the Anab'asis,  the Memorabil'ia of Socrates, and the Cyropedi'a, a political  romance. He was born about 443 B.C. The best English translation  of his works is by Watson, in Harper's \"New Classical Library.\"    The work of the Greek historian, Polybius, originally in forty  volumes, of which only five remain entire covered a period from  the downfall of the Macedonian power to the subversion of Grecian  liberty by the Romans, 146 B.C. It is a work of great accuracy,  but of little rhetorical polish, and embraces much of Roman history  from which Livy derived most of the materials for his account of  the wars with Carthage.    In the first century of our era, Plutarch, a Greek biographer,  wrote the \"Parallel Lives\" of forty-six distinguished Greeks and  Romans--a charming and instructive work, translated by John and  William Langhorne in 1771, and by Arthur Hugh Clough in 1858.    A history of Greece, in seven volumes, by George Finlay, a British  historian, long resident at Athens, is noted for a thorough knowledge  of Greek topography, art, and antiquity. The completed work embraces  a period from the conquest of Greece by the Romans to the middle  of the present century.    A History of Greek Literature, by J, P. Mahaffy, is the most  polished descriptive work in the department which it embraces.  It is happily supplemented by J. Addington Symonds' Studies of  the Greek Poets. Mr. Mahaffy, in common with many German scholars,  is an unbeliever in the unity of the Iliad.          CONTENTS.
