[No. 91,147]]        THE LEGEND OF THE CREATION ACCORDING TO BEROSUS AND DAMASCIUS.    Versions in Greek of the Legends found by George Smith had long been  known to classical scholars, owing to the preservation of fragments of  them in the works of later Greek writers, e.g., Eusebius, Syncellus, and  others. The most important of these is derived from the History of  Babylonia, which was written in Greek by BEROSUS, a priest of  Bel-Marduk, i.e., the \"Lord Marduk,\" at Babylon, about 250 B.C. In this  work Berosus reproduced all the known historical facts and traditions  derived from native sources which were current in his day. It is  therefore not surprising to find that his account of the Babylonian  beliefs about the origin of things corresponds very closely with that  given in the cuneiform texts, and that it is of the greatest use in  explaining and partly in expanding these texts. His account of the  primeval abyss, out of which everything came, and of its  inhabitants reads:--    [Illustration: Babylonian Monster. [No. 108,979.]]    \"There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness and an  abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were  produced on a two-fold principle. There appeared men, some of whom  were furnished with two wings, others with four, and with two  faces. They had one body but two heads; the one that of a man, the  other of a woman; and likewise in their several organs both male and  female. Other human figures were to be seen with the legs and horns of  goats; some had horses' feet; while others united the hind-quarters of  a horse with the body of a man, resembling in shape the hippo-centaurs.  Bulls likewise were bred there with the heads of men, and dogs with  four told bodies, terminated in their extremities with the tails of  fishes; horses also with the heads of dogs; men too and other animals,  with the heads and bodies of horses and the tails of fishes. In short,  there were creatures in which were combined the limbs of every species  of animals. In addition to these, fishes, reptiles, serpents, with  other monstrous animals, which assumed each other's shape and  countenance. Of all which were preserved delineations in the temple of  Belus at Babylon.\"    [Illustration: Babylonian Demon. [No. 93,089.]]      [THE SLAUGHTER OF THE QUEEN OF THE ABYSS.]    \"The person, who presided over them, was a woman named OMUROCA; which  in the Chaldean language is THALATTH; in Greek THALASSA, the sea; but  which might equally be interpreted the Moon. All things being in this  situation, Belus came, and cut the woman asunder: and of one half of  her he formed the earth, and of the other half the heavens; and at the  same time destroyed the animals within her. All this (he says) was an  allegorical description of nature.\"      [THE CREATION OF MAN.]    \"For, the whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being  generated therein, the deity above-mentioned[1] took off his own head:  upon which the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with the  earth; and from whence were formed men. On this account it is that  they are rational and partake of divine knowledge.\"    [Footnote 1: The god whose head was taken off was not Belus, as is  commonly thought, but the god who the cuneiform texts tell us was  called \"Kingu.\"]      [BELUS CREATES THE UNIVERSE.]    \"This Belus, by whom they signify Jupiter, divided the darkness, and  separated the Heavens from the Earth, and reduced the universe to  order. But the animals not being able to bear the prevalence of light,  died. Belus upon this, seeing a vast space unoccupied, though by  nature fruitful, commanded one[1] of the gods to take off his head,  and to mix the blood with the earth; and from thence to form other men  and animals, which should be capable of bearing the air. Belus formed  also the stars, and the sun, and the moon, and the five planets. Such,  according to Polyhistor Alexander, is the account which Berosus gives  in his first book.\" (See Cory, _Ancient Fragments_, London, 1832,  pp. 24-26.)    [Footnote 1: The god whose head was taken off was not Belus, as is  commonly thought, but the god who the cuneiform texts tell us was  called \"Kingu.\"]    In the sixth century of our era DAMASCIUS the SYRIAN, the last of the  Neo-Platonic philosophers, wrote in Greek in a work on the Doubts and  Solutions of the first Principles, in which he says: \"But the  Babylonians, like the rest of the Barbarians, pass over in silence the  One principle of the Universe, and they conceive Two, TAUTHE and  APASON; making APASON the husband of TAUTHE, and denominating her the  mother of the gods. And from these proceeds an only-begotten son,  MOYMIS, which I conceive is no other than the Intelligible World  proceeding from the two principles. From these, also, another progeny  is derived, DACHE and DACHUS; and again, a third, KISSARE and ASSORUS,  from which last three others proceed, ANUS, and ILLINUS, and AUS. And  of AUS and DAUCE is born a son called Belus, who, they say, is the  fabricator of the world, the Demiurgus.\" (See Cory, _Ancient  Fragments_, London, 1832, p. 318.)        THE SEVEN TABLETS OF CREATION. DESCRIPTION OF THEIR CONTENTS.    In the beginning nothing whatever existed except APSU, which may be  described as a boundless, confused and disordered mass of watery matter;  how it came into being is unknown. Out of this mass there were evolved  two orders of beings, namely, demons and gods. The demons had hideous  forms, even as Berosus said, which were part animal, part bird, part  reptile and part human. The gods had wholly human forms, and they  represented the three layers of the comprehensible world, that is to  say, heaven or the sky, the atmosphere, and the underworld. The  atmosphere and the underworld together formed the earth as opposed to  the sky or heaven. The texts say that the first two gods to be created  were LAKHMU and LAKHAMU. Their attributes cannot at present be  described, but they seem to represent two forms of primitive matter.  They appear to have had no existence in popular religion, and it has  been thought that they may be described as theological conceptions  containing the notions of matter and some of its attributes.    [Illustration: Terra-cotta figure of a Babylonian Demon. [No. 22,458.]]    After countless aeons had passed the gods ANSHAR and KISHAR came into  being; the former represents the \"hosts of heaven,\" and the latter the  \"hosts of earth.\"    After another long and indefinite period the independent gods of the  Babylonian pantheon came into being, e.g., ANU, EA, who is here called  NUDIMMUD, and others.    [Illustration: Bronze figure of a Babylonian Demon. [No. 93,078.]]    As soon as the gods appeared in the universe \"order\" came into being.  When APSU, the personification of confusion and disorder of every kind,  saw this \"order,\" he took counsel with his female associate TIAMAT with  the object of finding some means of destroying the \"way\" (_al-ka-at_) or  \"order\" of the gods. Fortunately the Babylonians and Assyrians have  supplied us with representations of Tiamat, and these show us what form  ancient tradition assigned to her. She is depicted as a ferocious  monster with wings and scales and terrible claws, and her body is  sometimes that of a huge serpent, and sometimes that of an animal. In  the popular imagination she represented all that was physically  terrifying, and foul, and abominable; she was nevertheless the mother of  everything, [1] and was the possessor of the DUP SHIMATI or \"TABLET OF  DESTINIES\". No description of this Tablet or its contents is available,  but from its name we may assume that it was a sort of Babylonian Book of  Fate.[2] Theologically, Tiamat represented to the Babylonians the same  state in the development of the universe as did _tohu wa-bhohu_ (Genesis  i. 2), i.e., formlessness and voidness, of primeval matter, to the  Hebrews She is depicted both on bas-reliefs and on cylinder seals in a  form which associates her with LABARTU, [3] a female devil that prowled  about the desert at night suckling wild animals but killing men. And it  is tolerably certain that she was the type, and symbol, and head of the  whole community of fiends, demons and devils.    [Footnote 1: _Muallidat gimrishun_.]    [Footnote 2: It is probable that the idea of this Tablet is perpetuated  in the \"Preserved Tablet\" of the Kur'an (Surah x, 62), on which the  destiny of every man was written at or before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9922"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Cortez, the conqueror of Mexico, who lived unknown and disgraced in  Spain, was scarcely able to obtain an audience of his master Charles V.;  and when the king asked who was the fellow that was so clamorous to  speak to him, he cried out, \"I am one who have got your majesty more  provinces than your father left towns.\"    Camoens, the famous Portuguese poet, was unfortunately shipwrecked at  the mouth of the river Meco, on the coast of Camboja, and lost his whole  property; however, he saved his life and his poems, which he bore  through the waves in one hand, whilst he swam ashore with the other. It  is said, that his black servant, a native of Java, who had been his  companion for many years, begged in the Streets of Lisbon for the  support of his master, who died in 1579. His death, it is supposed, was  accelerated by the anguish with which he foresaw the ruin impending over  his country. In one of his letters he uses these remarkable expressions:  \"I am ending the course of my life; the world will witness how I have  loved my country. I have returned not only to die in her bosom, but to  die with her.\"    Henrietta, daughter of Henry IV. of France, and wife of Charles I. of  England, was reduced to the utmost poverty; and her daughter, afterwards  married to a brother of Louis XIV., is said to have lain in bed for want  of coals to keep her warm. Pennant relates a melancholy fact of fallen  majesty in the person of Mary d'Este, the unhappy queen of James II.,  who, flying with her infant prince from the ruin impending over their  house, after crossing the Thames from abdicated Whitehall, took shelter  beneath the ancient walls of Lambeth church a whole hour, from the rain  of the inclement night of December 6th, 1688. Here she waited with  aggravated misery till a common coach, procured from the next inn,  arrived, and conveyed her to Gravesend, from whence she sailed, and bid  adieu to this kingdom.    Pascal, one of the greatest geniuses and best men that ever lived,  entertained a notion that God made men miserable here in order to their  being happy hereafter; and in consequence of this notion, he imposed  upon himself the most painful mortification. He even ordered a wall to  be built before a window in his study, which afforded him too agreeable  a prospect. He had also a girdle full of sharp points next his skin; and  while he was eating or drinking any thing that was grateful to his  palate, he was constantly pricking himself, that he might not be  sensible of any pleasure. The virtuous Fenelon submitted without reserve  to the arbitrary sentence of the pope, when he condemned a book which he  had published, and even preached in condemnation of his own book,  forbidding his friends to defend it. \"What gross and humiliating  superstitions (says their biographer) have been manifested by men, in  other respects of sound and clear understandings, and of upright,  honest hearts.\"    In the churchyard of St. Ann's, Soho, says Pennant, is a marble, erected  near the grave of that remarkable personage, Theodore Antony Newhoff,  king of Corsica, who died in this parish in 1756, immediately after  leaving the king's-bench prison, by the benefit of the act of  insolvency. The marble was erected, and the epitaph written, by the  honourable Horace Walpole:--        \"The grave, great teacher, to a level brings      Heroes and beggars, galley-slaves and kings;      But Theodore this moral learn'd ere dead--      Fate pour'd its lesson on his living head,      Bestow'd a kingdom, and denied him bread.\"    He registered his kingdom of Corsica for the use of his creditors. His  biographer says, \"He was a man whose claim to royalty was as  indisputable as the most ancient titles to any monarchy can pretend to  be; that is, the choice of his subjects, the voluntary election of an  injured people, who had the common right of mankind to freedom, and the  uncommon resolution of determining to be free.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *      \"THE LILY BELLS ARE WET WITH DEW.\"    (_To the Editor of the Mirror._)      Sir,--I have taken the liberty of transmitting to you a piece of a Latin  ode, which appears to me to be the original of the song--\"The lily bells  are wet with dew,\" in Miss Mitford's \"Dramatic Scenes,\" which appeared  in your miscellany of June 23, 1827.

(_For the Mirror._)      It has been computed, that all the celestial orbs perceived by the  unassisted eye (which on a clear night never exceed 1,000,) do not form  the 80,000 part of those which may be descried by the help of a  telescope, through which they appear prodigiously increased in number;  seventy stars have been counted in the constellation of the _pleiades_,  and no fewer than 2,000 in that of _Orion_.    The _galaxy_, or _via lactea_, (milky way,) is a remarkable appearance  in the heavens, being a broad ray of whitish colour surrounding the  whole celestial concave, whose light proceeds from vast clusters of  stars, discoverable only by the telescope. Mr. Brydone, in his journey  to the top of Mount Etna, found the phenomenon make a most glorious  appearance, \"like a pure flame that shot across the heavens.\"    Dr. Herschel made many observations on this portion of the heavens,  using a Newtonian reflector of twenty feet focal length, and an aperture  of eighteen inches. With this powerful telescope he completely resolved  the whitish appearance into stars, which the telescopes he had formerly  used had not light enough to do. In the most vacant place to be met with  in that neighbourhood, he found sixty-three stars; other six fields, or  apparent spaces in the heavens, which he could see at once through his  telescope, averaged seventy-nine stars in each field: thus he found that  by allowing 15 min. of a deg. for the diameter of his field of view, a  belt of 15 deg. long, and 2 deg. broad, which he had often seen pass  before his telescope in an hour's time could not contain less than  50,000 stars, large enough to be distinctly numbered, besides which he  suspected twice as many more, which could be seen only now and then by  faint glimpses, for want of sufficient light. In the most crowded part  of that region he informs us, he has had fields of view which contained  no less than 588 stars, and these were continued for many minutes, so  that in one quarter of an hour's time there passed no less than 116,000  stars. He also intimates the probability of the sun being placed in this  great stratum, though perhaps not in the very centre of its thickness.    From the appearance of the galaxy it seems to encompass the whole  heavens, as it certainly must if the sun be within the same. From  succeeding observations made by Dr. Herschel, he gathers that the milky  way is a most extensive stratum of stars of various sizes, and our sun  evidently one of the heavenly bodies belonging to it. In viewing and  gauging this shining zone in almost every direction, he found the number  of stars composing it, by the account of those gauges constantly  increase and decrease in proportion to its apparent brightness to the  naked eye.    The _nebulae_, or small whitish specks, discoverable by telescopes in  various parts of the heavens are owing to the same cause. Former  astronomers could only reckon 103, but Herschel counts upwards of 1,250.  He has also discovered a species of them, which he calls planetary  nebulae, on account of their brightness, and shining with a well  defined disk.    The sun enters _Virgo_ on the 23rd at 11h. 42m. evening.    Mercury comes to his inferior conjunction on the 13th at 1-1/4h.  morning, becomes stationary on the 22nd, and is at his greatest  elongation on the 31st, when he passes his ascending node; he may be  seen early on that morning rising at 3-1/2h.    Venus is in conjunction with Mars on the 21st at 3h. afternoon; she  rises on the 1st at 2h. 38m., and on the 31st at 4h. 10m. morning.    Jupiter still continues a conspicuous object in the western part of the  heavens, setting on the 1st at 9h. 43m., and on the 31st at 8h. None of  the eclipses of his satellites are visible during the month in  consequence of his being so near the sun.    Herschel comes to the south on the 1st at 11h. 6m., and on the 31st at  9h. 43m. evening.    _Spica virginis_ (the virgin's spike), in the constellation Virgo  culminates on the 1st at 4h. 32m. afternoon, being situated 10 deg. 13m.  south of the equator, at a meridional elevation of 28"]]]
