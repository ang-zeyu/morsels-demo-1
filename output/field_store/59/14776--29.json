Without dwelling further on the matter it is enough to say that in  general the State constitutions, their general laws, or penal statutes  provide that a person who is accused or suspected of crime must be  presumed innocent and treated accordingly until his guilt has been  affirmatively established in a jury trial; that meantime he must not be  confined or detained unless a crime has in fact been committed and there  is at least reasonable cause to believe that he has committed it; and,  further, that if arrested he must be given an immediate opportunity  to secure bail, to have the advice of counsel, and must in no way be  compelled to give any evidence against himself. So much for the law. It  is as plain as a pikestaff. It is printed in the books in words of  one syllable. So far as the law is concerned we have done our best  to perpetuate the theories of those who, fearing that they might be  arrested without a hearing, transported for trial, and convicted in a  king's court before a king's judge for a crime they knew nothing of,  insisted on \"liberty or death.\" They had had enough of kings and their  ways. Hereafter they were to have \"a government of laws and not of men.\"    But the unfortunate fact remains that all laws, however perfect, must in  the end be administered by imperfect men. There is, alas! no such thing  as a government of laws and not of men. You may have a government  more of laws and less of men, or vice versa, but you cannot have an  auto-administration of the Golden Rule. Sooner or later you come to a  man--in the White House, or on a wool sack, or at a desk in an office,  or in a blue coat and brass buttons--and then, to a very considerable  extent, the question of how far ours is to be a government of laws or of  men depends upon him. Generally, so far as he is concerned, it is going  to be of man, for every official finds that the letter of the law works  an injustice many times out of a hundred. If he is worth his salary he  will try to temper justice with mercy. If he is human he will endeavor  to accomplish justice as he sees it so long as the law can be stretched  to accommodate the case. Thus, inevitably there is a conflict  between the law and its application. It is the human element in the  administration of the law that enables lawyers to get a living. It is  usually not difficult to tell what the law is; the puzzle is how it  is going to be applied in any individual case. How it is going to be  applied depends very largely upon the practical side of the matter and  the exigencies of existing conditions.    It is pretty hard to apply inflexibly laws over a hundred years old. It  is equally hard to police a city of a million or so polyglot inhabitants  with a due regard to their theoretic constitutional rights. But suppose  in addition that these theoretic rights are entirely theoretic and fly  in the face of the laws of nature, experience, and common sense? What  then? What is a police commissioner to do who has either got to make an  illegal arrest or let a crook get away, who must violate the rights of  men illegally detained by outrageously \"mugging\" them or egregiously  fail to have a record of the professional criminals in his bailiwick?  He does just what all of us do under similar conditions--he \"takes a  chance.\" But in the case of the police the thing is so necessary that  there ceases practically to be any \"chance\" about it. They have got to  prevent crime and arrest criminals. If they fail they are out of a  job, and others more capable or less scrupulous take their places. The  fundamental law qualifying all systems is that of necessity. You can't  let professional crooks carry off a voter's silverware simply because  the voter, being asleep, is unable instantly to demonstrate beyond  a reasonable doubt that his silver has been stolen. You can't permit  burglars to drag sacks of loot through the streets of the city at 4 A.M.  simply because they are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. And  if \"arrest on suspicion\" were not permitted, demanded by the public,  and required by the police ordinances, away would go the crooks and off  would go the silverware, the town would be full of \"leather snatchers\"  and \"strong-arm men,\" respectable citizens would be afraid to go out o'  nights, and liberty would degenerate into license. That is the point. We  Americans, or at least some of the newer ones of us, have an idea that  \"liberty\" means the right to steal apples from our neighbor's orchard  without interference. Now, somewhere or other, there has got to be a  switch and a strong arm to keep us in order, and the switch and arm must  not wait until the apples are stolen and eaten before getting busy. If  we come climbing over the fence sweating apples at every pore, is Farmer  Jones to go and count his apples before grabbing us?    The most presumptuous of all presumptions is this \"presumption of  innocence.\" It really doesn't exist, save in the mouths of judges and in  the pages of the law books. Yet as much to-do is made about it as if  it were a living legal principle. Every judge in a criminal case is  required to charge the jury in form or substance somewhat as follows:  \"The defendant is presumed to be innocent until that presumption is  removed by competent evidence\"... \"This presumption is his property,  remaining with him throughout the trial and until rebutted by the  verdict of the jury.\"... \"The jury has no right to consider the fact  that the defendant stands at the bar accused of a crime by an indictment  found by the grand jury.\" Shades of Sir Henry Hawkins! Does the judge  expect that they are actually to swallow that? Here is a jury sworn \"to  a true verdict find\" in the case of an ugly looking customer at the bar  who is charged with knocking down an old man and stealing his watch. The  old man--an apostolic looking octogenarian--is sitting right over there  where the jury can see him. One look at the plaintiff and one at the  accused and the jury may be heard to mutter, \"He's guilty,--all right!\"    \"Presumed to be innocent?\" Why, may I ask? Do not the jury and everybody  else know that this good old man would never, save by mistake, accuse  anybody falsely of crime? Innocence! Why, the natural and inevitable  presumption is that the defendant is guilty! The human mind works  intuitively by comparison and experience. We assume or presume with  considerable confidence that parents love their children, that all  college presidents are great and good men, and that wild bulls are  dangerous animals. We may be wrong. But it is up to the other fellow to  show us the contrary.    Now, if out of a clear sky Jones accuses Robinson of being a thief we  know by experience that the chances are largely in favor of Jones's  accusation being well founded. People as a rule don't go rushing around  charging each other with being crooks unless they have some reason  for it. Thus, at the very beginning the law flies in the face of  probabilities when it tells us that a man accused of crime must be  presumed to be innocent. In point of fact, whatever presumption there is  (and this varies with the circumstances) is all the other way, greater  or less depending upon the particular attitude of mind and experience of  the individual.    This natural presumption of guilt from the mere fact of the charge is  rendered all the more likely by reason of the uncharitable readiness  with which we believe evil of our fellows. How unctuously we repeat some  hearsay bit of scandal. \"I suppose you have heard the report that  Deacon Smith has stolen the church funds?\" we say to our friends with a  sententious sigh--the outward sign of an invisible satisfaction. Deacon  Smith after the money-bag? Ha! ha! Of course, he's guilty! These deacons  are always guilty! And in a few minutes Deacon Smith is ruined forever,  although the fact of the matter may well have been that he was but  counting the money in the collection-plate. This willingness to believe  the worst of others is a matter of common knowledge and of historical  and literary record. \"The evil that men do lives after them--\" It might  well have been put, \"The evil men are said to have done lives forever.\"  However unfair, this is a psychologic condition which plays an important  part in rendering the presumption of innocence a gross absurdity.    But let us press the history of Jones and Robinson a step further. The  next event in the latter's criminal history is his appearance in  court before a magistrate. Jones produces his evidence and calls his  witnesses. Robinson, through his learned counsel, cross-examines  them and then summons his own witnesses to prove his innocence. The  proceeding may take several days or perhaps weeks. Briefs are submitted.  The magistrate considers the testimony and finally decides that he  believes Robinson guilty and must hold him for the action of the  grand jury. You might now, it would perhaps seem, have some reason for  suspecting that Robinson was not all that he should be. But no! He is  still presumed in the eyes of the law, and theoretically in the eyes of  his fellows, to be as innocent as a babe unborn. And now the grand jury  take up and sift the evidence that has already been gone over by the  police judge. They, too, call witnesses and take additional testimony.  They likewise are convinced of Robinson's guilt and straightway hand  down an indictment accusing him of the crime. A bench warrant issues.  The defendant is run to earth and ignominiously haled to court. But he  is still presumed to be innocent! Does not the law say so? And is not  this a \"government of laws\"? Finally, the district attorney, who is not  looking for any more work than is absolutely necessary, investigates the  case, decides that it must be tried and begins to prepare it for trial.

The angel appeared to me three times      the same night and unfolded the same things. After having received      many visits from the angels of God unfolding the majesty and glory      of the events that should transpire in the last days, on the      morning of the 22d of September, A.D. 1827, the angel of the Lord      delivered the records into my hands.        DESCRIPTION OF THE NEPHITE RECORD.        \"These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance      of gold; each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long,      and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with      engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound together in a volume      as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the      whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a      part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were      small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many      marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art      of engraving. With the records was found a curious instrument,      which the ancients called 'Urim and Thummim,' which consisted      of two transparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to      a breastplate. Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I      translated the record by the gift and power of God.        \"In this important and interesting book the history of ancient      America is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that      came from the Tower of Babel, at the confusion of languages, to      the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are      informed by these records that America in ancient times had been      inhabited by two distinct races of people. The first was called      Jaredites and came directly from the Tower of Babel. The second      race came directly from the City of Jerusalem, about six hundred      years before Christ. They were principally Israelites, of the      descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time      that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the      inheritance of the country. The principal nation of the second race      fell in battle towards the close of the fourth century [A.D.].      The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country. This      book also tells us that our Savior made His appearance upon this      continent after His resurrection; that He planted the gospel here      in all its fulness, and richness, and power, and blessing; that      they had apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists;      the same order, the same priesthood, the same ordinances,      gifts, powers, and blessings, as were enjoyed on the Eastern      continent; that the people were cut off in consequence of their      transgressions; that the last of their prophets who existed among      them was commanded to write an abridgment of their prophecies,      history, etc., and to hide it up in the earth, and that it should      come forth and be united with the Bible for the accomplishment of      the purposes of God in the last days.\"    The book issued from the press sometime in the month of March, 1830. [A]    [Footnote A: For a more detailed account of the origin of the Book of  Mormon, see the writer's work, \"New Witnesses for God,\" Vol. II, chs.  iv and viii.]    From the first appearance of Joseph Smith's account of the origin  of the Book of Mormon, there was felt the need of a counter theory  of origin. The first to respond to this \"felt\" need was Alexander  Campbell, founder of the \"Disciples\" or \"Christian\" Church. He  assigned the book's origin straight to Joseph Smith, whom he accused  of conscious fraud in \"foisting it upon the public as a revelation.\"  This in 1831. Then came the Spaulding theory of origin by Hurlburt,  Howe, _et al.,_ 1834; for which Mr. Campbell repudiated his first  theory of the Joseph Smith authorship. In 1899 Lily Dougall in \"The  Mormon Prophet,\" advanced her theory of the Prophet's \"self delusion,\"  \"by the automatic freaks of a vigorous but undisciplined brain.\" This  was supplemented in 1902 by Mr. I. Woodbridge Riley's theory of \"pure  hallucination, honestly mistaken for inspired vision; with partly  conscious and partly unconscious hypnotic powers over others.\" [B]    [Footnote B: Both the Dougall and Riley theories are considered in Vol.  I. of _Defense of the Faith and the Saints_, pp. 42-62; and the older  theories of the origin in _New Witness for God_, Vol. III, chas. xliv,  xlv.]    Mr. Schroeder, however, will have none of these later theories; and  although the finding of the Rev. Mr. Spauldings' \"Manuscript Found,\"  by Professor Fairchild of Oberlin College, in 1884--details of which  are given in the debate gave a serious set back to that theory, Mr.  Schroeder deems the Spaulding theory of the origin of the Book of  Mormon the only tenable counter theory advanced, and assuming the  existence of another Spaulding manuscript _not found,_ and not likely  to be found, he proceeds with his argument; to which I make answer,  with what success the reader must judge.    B. H. ROBERTS.    Salt Lake City, October, 1911.        THE ORIGIN OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.    BY THEODORE SCHROEDER    I.    Every complete, critical discussion of the divine origin of the Book  of Mormon naturally divides itself into three parts:--first, an  examination as to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in support  of its miraculous and divine origin; second, an examination of the  internal evidences of its origin, [1] such as its verbiage, its alleged  history, chronology, archaeology, etc.; third, an accounting for its  existence by purely human agency and upon a rational basis, remembering  that Joseph Smith, the nominal founder and first prophet of Mormonism,  was probably too ignorant to have produced the whole volume unaided.  Under the last head, two theories have been advocated by non-Mormons.  By one of these, conscious fraud has been imputed to Smith, and by the  other, psychic mysteries have been explored [2] in an effort to supplant  the conscious fraud by an unconscious self-deception.    [Footnote 1: Valuable contributions to this study are Lamb's \"Golden  Bible\" and a pamphlet by Lamoni Call classifying two thousand  corrections in the inspired grammar of the first edition of the Book of  Mormon.]    [Footnote 2: The best effort along this line is Riley's \"The Founder of  Mormonism.\" To me the conclusions are very unsatisfactory, because so  many material considerations were overlooked by that author.]    In 1834, four years after its first appearance, an effort was made to  show that the Book of Mormon was a plagiarism from an unpublished novel  of Solomon Spaulding. For a long time this seemed the accepted theory  of all non-Mormons. In the past fifteen years, apparently following  in the lead of President Fairchild of Oberlin College, [3] all but  two of the numerous writers upon the subject have asserted that the  theory of the Spaulding manuscript origin of the Book of Mormon must be  abandoned, and Mormons assert that only fools and knaves still profess  belief in it. [4] With these last conclusions I am compelled to disagree.    [Footnote 3: President Fairchild, in the New York _Observer_ for  February 5, 1885, that being immediately after his discovery of the  Oberlin Manuscript, says: \"The theory of the origin of the Book of  Mormon in the traditional manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will probably  have to be relinquished. * * * Mr. Rice, myself, and others compared it  with the Book of Mormon, and could detect no resemblance between the  two in general or detail. * * * Some other explanation of the origin  of the Book of Mormon must be found, if an explanation is required.\"  (Reproduced in Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" 56. Talmage's \"Articles of  Faith,\" 278.)    Ten years later Mr. Fairchild is not so brash in assuming the Oberlin  Manuscript to be the only Spaulding Manuscript, and he certifies  only that the Oberlin Manuscript \"is not the original of the Book  of Mormon.\" (Letter dated Oct. 17, 1895, published in vol. lx.,  _Millennial Star,_ p. 697, Nov. 3, 1898. Talmage's \"Articles of Faith,\"  279.)    _Fairchild's Latest Statement._--In 1900 President Fairchild wrote the  Rev. J. D. Nutting as follows:    \"With regard to the manuscript of Mr. Spaulding now in the library of  Oberlin College, I have never stated, and know of no one who can state,  that it is the only manuscript which Spaulding wrote, or that it is  certainly the one which has been supposed to be the original of the  Book of Mormon. The discovery of this MS. does not prove that there may  not have been another, which became the basis of the Book of Mormon.  The use which has been made of statements emanating from me as implying  the contrary of the above is entirely unwarranted.    \"JAMES H. FAIRCHILD\"]    [Footnote 4: The _Deseret News_ editorially says this on July 19, 1900:  \"The discovery of the manuscript written by Mr. Spaulding, and its  deposit in the library at Oberlin College, O., * * * has so completely  demolished the theory once relied upon by superficial minds that the  Book of Mormon was concocted from that manuscript, that it has been  entirely abandoned by all opponents of Mormonism except the densely  ignorant or unscrupulously dishonest.\"    And this on May 14, 1901:    \"It is only the densely ignorant, the totally depraved and clergymen of  different denominations afflicted with anti-Mormon rabies who still use  the Spaulding story to account for the origin of the Book of Mormon.\"]    In setting forth my convictions and the reasons for them, I have  undertaken nothing entirely new, but have only assigned myself the task "]]]
