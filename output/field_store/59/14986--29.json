Strenuous efforts have been made by eminent scholars to liberate  Islam from the chains of the authority of the past ages on the basis of  independent interpretation of the Qoran; not in the way of the Wahhabi  reformers, who tried a century before to restore the institutions of  Mohammed's time in their original purity, but on the contrary with the  object of adapting Islam by all means in their power to the requirements of  modern life.    Official protection of the bold innovators prevented their conservative  opponents from casting them out of the Azhar, but the assent to their  doctrines was more enthusiastic outside its walls than inside. The ever  more numerous adherents of modern thought in Egypt do not generally proceed  from the ranks of the Azhar students, nor do they generally care very much  in their later life for reforming the methods prevailing there, although  they may be inclined to applaud the efforts of the modernists. To the  intellectuals of the higher classes the Azhar has ceased to offer great  attraction; if it were not for the important funds (_wagf_) for the  benefit of professors and students, the numbers of both classes would have  diminished much more than is already the case, and the faithful cultivators  of mediaeval Mohammedan science would prefer to live in Mecca, free from  Western influence and control. Even as it is, the predilection of foreign  students of law and theology is turning more and more towards Mecca.    As one of the numerous interesting specimens of the mental development  effected in Egypt in the last years, I may mention a book that appeared in  Cairo two years ago[1], containing a description of the present Khedive's  pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, performed two years before. The author  evidently possesses a good deal of the scholastic learning to be gathered  in the Azhar and no European erudition in the stricter sense of the word.  In an introductory chapter he gives a summary of the geography and history  of the Arabian peninsula, describes the Hijaz in a more detailed manner,  and in his very elaborate account of the journey, on which he accompanied  his princely master, the topography of the holy cities, the peculiarities  of their inhabitants and of the foreign visitors, the political  institutions, and the social conditions are treated almost as fully and  accurately as we could desire from the hand of the most accomplished  European scholar. The work is illustrated by good maps and plans and by a  great number of excellent photographs expressly taken for this purpose by  the Khedive's order. The author intersperses his account with many witty  remarks as well as serious reflections on religious and political topics,  thus making it very readable to those of us who are familiar with the  Arabic language. He adorns his description of the holy places and of the  pilgrimage-rites with the unctuous phrases used in handbooks for the hajji,  and he does not disturb the mind of the pious reader by any historical  criticism of the traditions connected with the House of Allah, the Black  Stone, and the other sanctuaries, but he loses no opportunity to show his  dislike of all superstition; sometimes, as if to prevent Western readers  from indulging in mockery, he compares Meccan rites or customs with  superstitious practices current amongst Jews or Christians of today.    [Footnote 1: _Ar-rihlah al-Hijaziyyah_, by Muhammed Labib al-Batanunf, 2d  edition, Cairo, 1329 Hijrah.]    This book, at whose contents many a Meccan scholar of the old style will  shake his head and exclaim: \"We seek refuge near Allah from Satan, the  cursed!\" has been adopted by the Egyptian Department of Public Instruction  as a reading-book for the schools.    What surprised me more than anything else was the author's quoting as his  predecessors in the description of Mecca and Medina, Burckhardt, Burton,  and myself, and his sending me, although personally unacquainted with him,  a presentation copy with a flattering dedication. This author and his book  would have been impossible in the Moslim world not more than thirty years  ago. In Egypt such a man is nowadays already considered as one of those  more conservative moderns, who prefer the rationalistic explanation of the  Azhar lore to putting it aside altogether. Within the Azhar, his book is  sure to meet with hearty approval from the followers of Muhammed Abduh, but  not less hearty disapproval from the opponents of modernism who make up the  majority of the professors as well as of the students.    In these very last years a new progress of modern thought has manifested  itself in Cairo in the foundation, under the auspices of Fu'ad Pasha, an  uncle of the present Khedive, of the Egyptian University. Cairo has had for  a long time its schools of medicine and law, which could be turned easily  into university faculties; therefore, the founders of the university  thought it urgent to establish a faculty of arts, and, if this proved a  success, to add a faculty of science. In the meantime, gifted young men  were granted subsidies to learn at European universities what they needed  to know to be the professors of a coming generation, and, for the present,  Christian as well as Mohammedan natives of Egypt and European scholars  living in the country were appointed as lecturers; professors being  borrowed from the universities of Europe to deliver lectures in Arabic on  different subjects chosen more or less at random before an audience little  prepared to digest the lessons offered to them.    The rather hasty start and the lack of a well-defined scheme have made  the Egyptian University a subject of severe criticism. Nevertheless, its  foundation is an unmistakable expression of the desire of intellectual  Egypt to translate modern thought into its own language, to adapt modern  higher instruction to its own needs. This same aim is pursued in a perhaps  more efficacious manner by the hundreds of Egyptian students of law,  science, and medicine at French, English, and some other European  universities. The Turks could not freely follow such examples before  the revolution of 1908; but they have shown since that time that their  abstention was not voluntary. England, France, Holland, and other countries  governing Mohammedan populations are all endeavouring to find the right way  to incorporate their Mohammedan subjects into their own civilization. Fully  recognizing that it was the material covetousness of past generations  that submitted those nations to their rule, the so-called colonial powers  consider it their duty now to secure for them in international intercourse  the place which their natural talent enables them to occupy. The question  whether it is better simply to leave the Moslims to Islam as it was for  centuries is no longer an object of serious discussion, the reforming  process being at work everywhere--in some parts with surprising rapidity.  We can only try to prognosticate the solution which the near future  reserves for the problem, how the Moslim world is to be associated with  modern thought.    In this problem the whole civilized world and the whole world of Islam are  concerned. The ethnic difference between Indians, North-Africans, Malays,  etc., may necessitate a difference of method in detail; the Islam problem  lies at the basis of the question for all of them. On the other hand,  the future development of Islam does not only interest countries with  Mohammedan dominions, it claims as well the attention of all the nations  partaking in the international exchange of material and spiritual goods.  This would be more generally recognized if some knowledge of Islam were  more widely spread amongst ourselves; if it were better realized that Islam  is next akin to Christianity.    It is the Christian mission that shows the deepest consciousness of this  state of things, and the greatest activity in promoting an association  of Mohammedan thought with that of Western nations. The solid mass of  experience due to the efforts of numerous missionaries is not of an  encouraging nature. There is no reasonable hope of the conversion  of important numbers of Mohammedans to any Christian denomination.  Broad-minded missionary societies have therefore given up the old fruitless  proselytizing methods and have turned to social improvement in the way of  education, medical treatment, and the like. It cannot be denied, that  what they want above all to bring to Mohammedans is just what these most  energetically decline to accept. On the other hand the advocates of a  purely civilizing mission are bound to acknowledge that, but for rare  exceptions, the desire of incorporating Mohammedan nations into our world  of thought does not rouse the devoted, self-denying enthusiasm inspired by  the vocation of propagating a religious belief. The ardour displayed by  some missionaries in establishing in the Dar al-Islam Christian centres  from which they distribute to the Mohammedans those elements of our  civilization which are acceptable to them deserves cordial praise; the more  so because they themselves entertain but little hope of attaining  their ultimate aim of conversion. Mohammedans who take any interest in  Christianity are taught by their own teachers that the revelation of Jesus,  after having suffered serious corruption by the Christians themselves, has  been purified and restored to its original simplicity by Mohammed, and are  therefore inaccessible to missionary arguments; nay, amongst uncivilized  pagans the lay mission of Islam is the most formidable competitor of  clerical propagation of the Christian faith.    People who take no active part in missionary work are not competent to  dissuade Christian missionaries from continuing their seemingly hopeless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#20)"],[1," the sympathies of Italian  Socialists and with them, the whole Italian nation for the purposes of  German nationalism.--Author.]    \"Delia Seta answered that this was no justification for giving their  support. The Italian Socialists would not have given their assistance  under the same circumstances, just as they had refused to vote in favour  of the Libyan war.    \"Dr. Suedekum replied that the German Socialists were compelled to defend  their Fatherland against Czarism. Further, he repeated Haase's  declaration in the Reichstag and continued: 'I am astonished that the  Italian Socialists are able to believe, that so strong a party as the  German Democrats, had denied their ideals, and been untrue to their  task. You must admit that no other way was open to us, except to grant  the credit demanded.'    \"After this, he asserted the nationalist Press of France and Italy was  working against Germany, and it seemed as if the Italian comrades were  in agreement with Italian nationalists in endeavouring to maintain the  existing condition of affairs[83] in Italy.    [Footnote 83: \"The existing condition of affairs\" seems to mean Italian  neutrality.--Author.]    \"Finally Suedekum concluded by pointing out that the German Democrats had  neither the intention, nor the right, to influence the attitude of the  Italian Socialists, but were merely endeavouring to link up hearty  international intercourse again.    \"In reply Delia Seta said he found it remarkable that the German  Socialists had appealed to their Italian comrades in this solemn hour,  all the more remarkable because intentions might easily be ascribed to  this intervention. 'This is a serious motive which impels us to state  our opinions with unreserved frankness.'    \"He continued: 'Your defence does not convince us. You speak of France  being allied with us, and of England, Germany's enemy. But we speak of  our France, revolutionary France, Jaure's France. The French Socialists  opposed the military preparations made by France, you Germans did not do  the same in your country, or at least, only up to the point where the  imperialistic feelings of the Kaiser and his party might be hurt.    \"'The point of view of German Democrats coincides with that of German  imperialism. German predominance means for us a far greater danger than  Czarism, because Czarism prevents the German army from marching on  Paris, and thus protects the banner of France, which in spite of all  mistakes and errors, is still the most revolutionary.    \"'Germany's motto is: _Deutschland ueber alles_ and you have not opposed  it; but you have published in the _Vorwaerts_ an appreciation of the  Kaiser alleging that he had worked during twenty-five years for peace.    \"'You speak of German civilization being in danger. But in this  civilization we can find no trace of culture, when you attack and  torture neutral Belgium, and complete the destruction of Louvain. Taken  as a whole, German Socialists are just as plausible and use the same  excuses as the Ministers of the German Government.[84]    [Footnote 84: Might not this also be said of Messrs. Morel, Macdonald,  Bernard Shaw, etc., and the _Labour Leader_, whose writings on the war  have been scattered broadcast throughout Germany during the last six  months?]    \"'We are enraged at the terrible fact that Germany has violated  Belgium's neutrality, and you have not even protested. We tell you quite  openly that we honour and weep for devastated Belgium, and tremblingly  follow the fate of France.'\"    Suedekum had no words with which to answer this terrible indictment, and  the _Vorwaerts_ could only add the following comment:    \"We consider the judgment of our Italian comrades to be one-sided, but  for reasons easy to understand, desist from discussing it in the present  situation. Unfortunately we must recognize the fact, however, that the  Italian view is widespread among the Socialists of other neutral  countries.\"    Germany's revolutionary party lost no time in hoisting the banner of \"no  annexations.\" The _Leipziger Folkszeitung_, second in importance only to  the _Vorwaerts_ nailed down a phrase in the Kaiser's speech from the  throne, which stated: \"We are inspired by no desire for conquest.\" In  commenting on this phrase, Kautsky's organ said:    \"The part of the speech which excites most sympathy in us is the  admission that Germany cherishes no lust for conquest. At the proper  time we shall refer to that again.    \"It is with sincere regret that we see the French Government on the side  of the criminal Powers, which have enslaved and robbed the Russian  people. If Germany, in a delirium of victory, should raise claims which  mean annexation, then we shall--that must be repeated again--recall the  speech from the throne of the German Kaiser on August 4th, 1914.\"[85]    [Footnote 85: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 4th.]    During the first year of war a split among the Social Democrats has  become evident, and it appears certain that it is the annexation  question which is causing the cleavage. In December last Liebknecht  abstained from voting when the second war loan was granted by the  Reichstag. Evidently doubts have arisen in a small section of the party  either as to the origin of the war, or in regard to the objects which  the German Government hopes to attain.    On August 20th, 1915, Dr. Liebknecht put this question in the Reichstag:  \"Is the Government prepared to enter into immediate peace negotiations  on the basis that Germany renounces all annexation claims and assuming  that the other Powers in question are willing to negotiate?\" Von Jagow  replied: \"I believe the great majority of the members will agree with  me, when I refuse to answer the question, as being at present beside the  purpose.\"    The reply evoked a hurricane of \"bravos.\"    A parallel may be found in the year 1870. The central committee of  German Social Democrats passed a resolution that: \"It is absolutely  necessary for the party to organize simultaneously in all parts of the  country great popular demonstrations against the annexation of  Alsace-Lorraine, and pass resolutions in favour of an honourable peace  with the French republic.\"    Nothing came of the movement, for on September 9th the committee was  placed under arrest and prosecuted. If Germany should be victorious in  this war, it is to be assumed that the Socialists would again prove  powerless to prevent annexation. What the allies cannot hinder, the  Social Democrats would be still more helpless to prevent; especially as  the great majority of them are unreservedly on the side of the Kaiser  and his Government. When in need, the latter flattered and persuaded the  Democrats to vote for an alleged war of defence; but should German arms  be victorious the German Government would neither seek, nor accept  advice on her national projects, from her quondam internationalists.    There are grounds for suspicion that the party is playing a game desired  by the Berlin Government. For some months past they have tried every  means possible to arrange personal interviews with the leaders of the  corresponding party in France--the French \"comrades\" have refused to  meet them. The _Leipziger Volkszeitung_ for July 16th, 1915, contains  more than a column about \"We and the French,\" in which the German party  spreads the usual Teutonic lime of sophistry and empty phrases.    One passage betrays the entire intrigue. They wish their \"French  brothers\" to agree to a peace without annexations, which means, in so  many words, that the French Socialists are to renounce Alsace-Lorraine  for ever. Had they been, or should they be in the future, so foolish as  to enter this German mouse-trap, then before the war has reached a  decisive conclusion, a large section of the French nation would be  pledged to renounce the lost provinces even in case of a German defeat.  This is an excellent instance of the manner in which German Social  Democracy works in an enemy country to assist its own Government. In  like manner, the Independent Labour Party and Union of Democratic  Control are forces exceedingly sensitive to German influence, and in a  decisive moment can be set in motion by the German \"comrades.\"    The hundred and eleven Social Democrats in the Reichstag have no real  power in Germany. If they possess any degree of power, then fear for  their own skins, prevents them from risking its exercise. Their real  opinion concerning Alsace-Lorraine appeared in the same journal four  days later. \"According to our opinion it would be a crime, if France  made the return of these provinces a condition of peace.\" In the same  article an accusation of one-sidedness is made against the Socialists in  France for supporting the French Government. After which, it is not  surprising that every time the names of the _Genossen_ Macdonald,  Snowden, Hardie and Newbold occur in the _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, they  are mentioned with awe and reverence.    \"Besides Ramsay Macdonald and Philip Snowden, our friend J.T. Walton  Newbold has got on the nerves of the English patriots.\"[86] These  gentlemen invariably receive polite mention, but French Socialists are  evidently in disfavour--presumably because they know too well the German  game.    [Footnote 86: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, July 23rd, 1915.]    The peace programme of the German Socialists has been published. An  official declaration of the party which appeared on August 23rd, 1915,  gives the following conditions.    \"While caring for the national interests and rights of our own people,  and at the same time respecting the vital interests of all nations,  German Social Democracy strives for a peace which bears the guarantee of  permanence, and will bring the European States closer together in  matters of justice, culture, and commerce. In this sense we have drawn  up the following scheme:    \"I. The security of German independence and the entirety of the German "]]]
