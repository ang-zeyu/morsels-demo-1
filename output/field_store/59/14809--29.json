My only regret regarding it is that I have not  dwelt sufficiently on the charm of West Africa; it is so difficult  to explain such things; but I am sure there are amongst my readers  people who know by experience the charm some countries exercise over  men--countries very different from each other and from West Africa.  The charm of West Africa is a painful one:  it gives you pleasure  when you are out there, but when you are back here it gives you pain  by calling you.  It sends up before your eyes a vision of a wall of  dancing white, rainbow-gemmed surf playing on a shore of yellow sand  before an audience of stately coco palms; or of a great mangrove-  watered bronze river; or of a vast aisle in some forest cathedral:  and you hear, nearer to you than the voices of the people round,  nearer than the roar of the city traffic, the sound of the surf that  is breaking on the shore down there, and the sound of the wind  talking on the hard palm leaves and the thump of the natives' tom-  toms; or the cry of the parrots passing over the mangrove swamps in  the evening time; or the sweet, long, mellow whistle of the plantain  warblers calling up the dawn; and everything that is round you grows  poor and thin in the face of the vision, and you want to go back to  the Coast that is calling you, saying, as the African says to the  departing soul of his dying friend, \"Come back, come back, this is  your home.\"                                         M.

Relateth the various causes which impelled the author to embark upon  the voyage.    It was in 1893 that, for the first time in my life, I found myself  in possession of five or six months which were not heavily  forestalled, and feeling like a boy with a new half-crown, I lay  about in my mind, as Mr. Bunyan would say, as to what to do with  them.  \"Go and learn your tropics,\" said Science.  Where on earth am  I to go? I wondered, for tropics are tropics wherever found, so I  got down an atlas and saw that either South America or West Africa  must be my destination, for the Malayan region was too far off and  too expensive.  Then I got Wallace's Geographical Distribution and  after reading that master's article on the Ethiopian region I  hardened my heart and closed with West Africa.  I did this the more  readily because while I knew nothing of the practical condition of  it, I knew a good deal both by tradition and report of South East  America, and remembered that Yellow Jack was endemic, and that a  certain naturalist, my superior physically and mentally, had come  very near getting starved to death in the depressing society of an  expedition slowly perishing of want and miscellaneous fevers up the  Parana.    My ignorance regarding West Africa was soon removed.  And although  the vast cavity in my mind that it occupied is not even yet half  filled up, there is a great deal of very curious information in its  place.  I use the word curious advisedly, for I think many seemed to  translate my request for practical hints and advice into an  advertisement that \"Rubbish may be shot here.\"  This same  information is in a state of great confusion still, although I have  made heroic efforts to codify it.  I find, however, that it can  almost all be got in under the following different headings, namely  and to wit:  -    The dangers of West Africa.  The disagreeables of West Africa.  The diseases of West Africa.  The things you must take to West Africa.  The things you find most handy in West Africa.  The worst possible things you can do in West Africa.    I inquired of all my friends as a beginning what they knew of West  Africa.  The majority knew nothing.  A percentage said, \"Oh, you  can't possibly go there; that's where Sierra Leone is, the white  mans grave, you know.\"  If these were pressed further, one  occasionally found that they had had relations who had gone out  there after having been \"sad trials,\" but, on consideration of their  having left not only West Africa, but this world, were now forgiven  and forgotten.    I next turned my attention to cross-examining the doctors.  \"Deadliest spot on earth,\" they said cheerfully, and showed me maps  of the geographical distribution of disease.  Now I do not say that  a country looks inviting when it is coloured in Scheele's green or a  bilious yellow, but these colours may arise from lack of artistic  gift in the cartographer.  There is no mistaking what he means by  black, however, and black you'll find they colour West Africa from  above Sierra Leone to below the Congo.  \"I wouldn't go there if I  were you,\" said my medical friends, \"you'll catch something; but if  you must go, and you're as obstinate as a mule, just bring me--\" and  then followed a list of commissions from here to New York, any one  of which--but I only found that out afterwards.    All my informants referred me to the missionaries.  \"There were,\"  they said, in an airy way, \"lots of them down there, and had been  for many years.\"  So to missionary literature I addressed myself  with great ardour; alas! only to find that these good people wrote  their reports not to tell you how the country they resided in was,  but how it was getting on towards being what it ought to be, and how  necessary it was that their readers should subscribe more freely,  and not get any foolishness into their heads about obtaining an  inadequate supply of souls for their money.  I also found fearful  confirmation of my medical friends' statements about its  unhealthiness, and various details of the distribution of cotton  shirts over which I did not linger.    From the missionaries it was, however, that I got my first idea  about the social condition of West Africa.  I gathered that there  existed there, firstly the native human beings--the raw material, as  it were--and that these were led either to good or bad respectively  by the missionary and the trader.  There were also the Government  representatives, whose chief business it was to strengthen and  consolidate the missionary's work, a function they carried on but  indifferently well.  But as for those traders! well, I put them down  under the dangers of West Africa at once.  Subsequently I came  across the good old Coast yarn of how, when a trader from that  region went thence, it goes without saying where, the Fallen Angel  without a moment's hesitation vacated the infernal throne (Milton)  in his favour.  This, I beg to note, is the marine form of the  legend.  When it occurs terrestrially the trader becomes a Liverpool  mate.  But of course no one need believe it either way--it is not a  missionary's story.    Naturally, while my higher intelligence was taken up with attending  to these statements, my mind got set on going, and I had to go.  Fortunately I could number among my acquaintances one individual who  had lived on the Coast for seven years.  Not, it is true, on that  part of it which I was bound for.  Still his advice was pre-  eminently worth attention, because, in spite of his long residence  in the deadliest spot of the region, he was still in fair going  order.  I told him I intended going to West Africa, and he said,  \"When you have made up your mind to go to West Africa the very best  thing you can do is to get it unmade again and go to Scotland  instead; but if your intelligence is not strong enough to do so,  abstain from exposing yourself to the direct rays of the sun, take 4  grains of quinine every day for a fortnight before you reach the  Rivers, and get some introductions to the Wesleyans; they are the  only people on the Coast who have got a hearse with feathers.\"    My attention was next turned to getting ready things to take with  me.  Having opened upon myself the sluice gates of advice, I rapidly  became distracted.  My friends and their friends alike seemed to  labour under the delusion that I intended to charter a steamer and  was a person of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.  This not being  the case, the only thing to do was to gratefully listen and let  things drift.    Not only do the things you have got to take, but the things you have  got to take them in, present a fine series of problems to the young  traveller.  Crowds of witnesses testified to the forms of baggage  holders they had found invaluable, and these, it is unnecessary to  say, were all different in form and material.    With all this embarras de choix I was too distracted to buy anything  new in the way of baggage except a long waterproof sack neatly  closed at the top with a bar and handle.  Into this I put blankets,  boots, books, in fact anything that would not go into my portmanteau  or black bag.  From the first I was haunted by a conviction that its  bottom would come out, but it never did, and in spite of the fact  that it had ideas of its own about the arrangement of its contents,  it served me well throughout my voyage.    It was the beginning of August '93 when I first left England for  \"the Coast.\"  Preparations of quinine with postage partially paid  arrived up to the last moment, and a friend hastily sent two  newspaper clippings, one entitled \"A Week in a Palm-oil Tub,\" which  was supposed to describe the sort of accommodation, companions, and  fauna likely to be met with on a steamer going to West Africa,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#2)"],[1,"their conduct by examples drawn from this source, are apt to fall into  the extravagances of the knight-errants of romance, and to entertain  projects that exceed their powers.    I esteemed eloquence highly, and was in raptures with poesy; but I  thought that both were gifts of nature rather than fruits of study.  Those in whom the faculty of reason is predominant, and who most  skillfully dispose their thoughts with a view to render them clear and  intelligible, are always the best able to persuade others of the truth  of what they lay down, though they should speak only in the language of  Lower Brittany, and be wholly ignorant of the rules of rhetoric; and  those whose minds are stored with the most agreeable fancies, and who  can give expression to them with the greatest embellishment and  harmony, are still the best poets, though unacquainted with the art of  poetry.    I was especially delighted with the mathematics, on account of the  certitude and evidence of their reasonings;  but I had not as yet a  precise knowledge of their true use; and thinking that they but  contributed to the advancement of the mechanical arts, I was astonished  that foundations, so strong and solid, should have had no loftier  superstructure reared on them.  On the other hand, I compared the  disquisitions of the ancient moralists to very towering and magnificent  palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud:  they laud the  virtues very highly, and exhibit them as estimable far above anything  on earth; but they give us no adequate criterion of virtue, and  frequently that which they designate with so fine a name is but apathy,  or pride, or despair, or parricide.    I revered our theology, and aspired as much as any one to reach heaven:  but being given assuredly to understand that the way is not less open  to the most ignorant than to the most learned, and that the revealed  truths which lead to heaven are above our comprehension, I did not  presume to subject them to the impotency of my reason; and I thought  that in order competently to undertake their examination, there was  need of some special help from heaven, and of being more than man.    Of philosophy I will say nothing, except that when I saw that it had  been cultivated for many ages by the most distinguished men, and that  yet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is not still  in dispute, and nothing, therefore, which is above doubt, I did not  presume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that  of others; and further, when I considered the number of conflicting  opinions touching a single matter that may be upheld by learned men,  while there can be but one true, I reckoned as well-nigh false all that  was only probable.    As to the other sciences, inasmuch as these borrow their principles  from philosophy, I judged that no solid superstructures could be reared  on foundations so infirm; and neither the honor nor the gain held out  by them was sufficient to determine me to their cultivation:  for I was  not, thank Heaven, in a condition which compelled me to make  merchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune; and though I  might not profess to scorn glory as a cynic, I yet made very slight  account of that honor which I hoped to acquire only through fictitious  titles.  And, in fine, of false sciences I thought I knew the worth  sufficiently to escape being deceived by the professions of an  alchemist, the predictions of an astrologer, the impostures of a  magician, or by the artifices and boasting of any of those who profess  to know things of which they are ignorant.    For these reasons, as soon as my age permitted me to pass from under  the control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of  letters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the  knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world.  I spent the  remainder of my youth in traveling, in visiting courts and armies, in  holding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, in  collecting varied experience, in proving myself in the different  situations into which fortune threw me, and, above all, in making such  reflection on the matter of my experience as to secure my improvement.  For it occurred to me that I should find much more truth in the  reasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he  is personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish  him if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters  in his study, regarding speculative matters that are of no practical  moment, and followed by no consequences to himself, farther, perhaps,  than that they foster his vanity the better the more remote they are  from common sense; requiring, as they must in this case, the exercise  of greater ingenuity and art to render them probable.  In addition, I  had always a most earnest desire to know how to distinguish the true  from the false, in order that I might be able clearly to discriminate  the right path in life, and proceed in it with confidence.    It is true that, while busied only in considering the manners of other  men, I found here, too, scarce any ground for settled conviction, and  remarked hardly less contradiction among them than in the opinions of  the philosophers.  So that the greatest advantage I derived from the  study consisted in this, that, observing many things which, however  extravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension, are yet by common  consent received and approved by other great nations, I learned to  entertain too decided a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of  which I had been persuaded merely by example and custom; and thus I  gradually extricated myself from many errors powerful enough to darken  our natural intelligence, and incapacitate us in great measure from  listening to reason.  But after I had been occupied several years in  thus studying the book of the world, and in essaying to gather some  experience, I at length resolved to make myself an object of study, and  to employ all the powers of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to  follow, an undertaking which was accompanied with greater success than  it would have been had I never quitted my country or my books.        PART II    I was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country,  which have not yet been brought to a termination; and as I was  returning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, the setting  in of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no society to  interest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or  passions, I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity  to occupy my attention with my own thoughts.  Of these one of the very  first that occurred to me was, that there is seldom so much perfection  in works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands  had been employed, as in those completed by a single master.   Thus it  is observable that the buildings which a single architect has planned  and executed, are generally more elegant and commodious than those  which several have attempted to improve, by making old walls serve for  purposes for which they were not originally built.  Thus also, those  ancient cities which, from being at first only villages, have become,  in course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid out compared  with the regularity constructed towns which a professional architect  has freely planned on an open plain; so that although the several  buildings of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of  the latter, yet when one observes their indiscriminate juxtaposition,  there a large one and here a small, and the consequent crookedness and  irregularity of the streets, one is disposed to allege that chance  rather than any human will guided by reason must have led to such an  arrangement.  And if we consider that nevertheless there have been at  all times certain officers whose duty it was to see that private  buildings contributed to public ornament, the difficulty of reaching  high perfection with but the materials of others to operate on, will be  readily acknowledged.  In the same way I fancied that those nations  which, starting from a semi-barbarous state and advancing to  civilization by slow degrees, have had their laws successively  determined, and, as it were, forced upon them simply by experience of  the hurtfulness of particular crimes and disputes, would by this  process come to be possessed of less perfect institutions than those  which, from the commencement of their association as communities, have  followed the appointments of some wise legislator.  It is thus quite  certain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances of  which are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of  every other.  And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that the  pre-eminence of Sparta was due not to the goodness of each of its laws  in particular, for many of these were very strange, and even opposed to  good morals, but to the circumstance that, originated by a single  individual, they all tended to a single end.  In the same way I thought  that the sciences contained in books (such of them at least as are made  up of probable reasonings, without demonstrations), composed as they  are of the opinions of many different individuals massed together, are  farther removed from truth than the simple inferences which a man of  good sense using his natural and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting  the matters of his experience.  And because we have all to pass through  a state of infancy to manhood, and have been of necessity, for a length  of time, governed by our desires and preceptors (whose dictates were  frequently conflicting, while neither perhaps always counseled us for  the best), I farther concluded that it is almost impossible that our  judgments can be so correct or"]]]
