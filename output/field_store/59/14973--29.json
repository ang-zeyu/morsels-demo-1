But sooner or later I suppose a woman has to pass through it.\"    A spot of color came in her sallow cheek.    \"That's sufficiently disagreeable, Vance.\"    A sense of his cowardice made him rise to conceal his confusion.    \"I'm going to take you at your word, sis. I'm going out to get that baby.  I suppose it can be bought--like a calf!\"    He went deliberately to the door and laid his hand on the knob. He had a  rather vicious pleasure in calling her bluff, but to his amazement she  did not call him back. He opened the door slowly. Still she did not  speak. He slammed it behind him and stepped into the hall.        CHAPTER 2      Twenty-four years made the face of Vance Cornish a little better-fed, a  little more blocky of cheek, but he remained astonishingly young. At  forty-nine the lumpish promise of his youth was quite gone. He was in a  trim and solid middle age. His hair was thinned above the forehead, but  it gave him more dignity. On the whole, he left an impression of a man  who has done things and who will do more before he is through.    He shifted his feet from the top of the porch railing and shrugged  himself deeper into his chair. It was marvelous how comfortable Vance  could make himself. He had one great power--the ability to sit still  through any given interval. Now he let his eye drift quietly over the  Cornish ranch. It lay entirely within one grasp of the vision, spilling  across the valley from Sleep Mountain, on the lower bosom of which the  house stood, to Mount Discovery on the north. Not that the glance of  Vance Cornish lurched across this bold distance. His gaze wandered as  slowly as a free buzzes across a clover field, not knowing on which  blossom to settle.    Below him, generously looped, Bear Creek tumbled out of the southeast,  and roved between noble borders of silver spruce into the shadows of the  Blue Mountains of the north, half a dozen miles across and ten long of  grazing and farm land, rich, loamy bottom land scattered with aspens.    Beyond, covering the gentle roll of the foothills, was grazing land.  Scattering lodgepole pine began in the hills, and thickened into dense  yellow-green thickets on the upper mountain slopes. And so north and  north the eye of Vance Cornish wandered and climbed until it rested on  the bald summit of Mount Discovery. It had its name out of its character,  standing boldly to the south out of the jumble of the Blue Mountains.    It was a solid unit, this Cornish ranch, fenced away with mountains,  watered by a river, pleasantly forested, and obviously predestined for  the ownership of one man. Vance Cornish, on the porch of the house, felt  like an enthroned king overlooking his dominions. As a matter of fact,  his holdings were hardly more than nominal.    In the beginning his father had left the ranch equally to Vance and  Elizabeth, thickly plastered with debts. The son would have sold the  place for what they could clear. He went East to hunt for education and  pleasure; his sister remained and fought the great battle by herself. She  consecrated herself to the work, which implied that the work was sacred.  And to her, indeed, it was.    She was twenty-two and her brother twelve when their father died. Had she  been a tithe younger and her brother a mature man, it would have been  different. As it was, she felt herself placed in a maternal position with  Vance. She sent him away to school, rolled up her sleeves and started to  order chaos. In place of husband, children--love and the fruits of love--  she accepted the ranch. The dam between the rapids and the waterfall was  the child of her brain; the plowed fields of the central part of the  valley were her reward.    In ten years of constant struggle she cleared away the debts. And then,  since Vance gave her nothing but bills to pay, she began to buy out his  interest. He chose to learn his business lessons on Wall Street.  Elizabeth paid the bills, but she checked the sums against his interest  in the ranch. And so it went on. Vance would come out to the ranch at  intervals and show a brief, feverish interest, plan a new set of  irrigation canals, or a sawmill, or a better road out over the Blue  Mountains. But he dropped such work half-done and went away.    Elizabeth said nothing. She kept on paying his bills, and she kept on  cutting down his interest in the old Cornish ranch, until at the present  time he had only a finger-tip hold. Root and branch, the valley and all  that was in it belonged to Elizabeth Cornish. She was proud of her  possession, though she seldom talked of her pride. Nevertheless, Vance  knew, and smiled. It was amusing, because, after all, what she had done,  and all her work, would revert to him at her death. Until that time, why  should he care in whose name the ranch remained so long as his bills were  paid? He had not worked, but in recompense he had remained young.  Elizabeth had labored all her youth away. At forty-nine he was ready to  begin the most important part of his career. At sixty his sister was a  withered old ghost of a woman.    He fell into a pleasant reverie. When Elizabeth died, he would set in  some tennis courts beside the house, buy some blooded horses, cut the  road wide and deep to let the world come up Bear Creek Valley, and retire  to the life of a country gentleman.    His sister's voice cut into his musing. She had two tones. One might be  called her social register. It was smooth, gentle--the low-pitched and  controlled voice of a gentlewoman. The other voice was hard and sharp. It  could drive hard and cold across a desk, and bring businessmen to an  understanding that here was a mind, not a woman.    At present she used her latter tone. Vance Cornish came into a shivering  consciousness that she was sitting beside him. He turned his head slowly.  It was always a shock to come out of one of his pleasant dreams and see  that worn, hollow-eyed, impatient face.    \"Are you forty-nine, Vance?\"    \"I'm not fifty, at least,\" he countered.    She remained imperturbable, looking him over. He had come to notice that  in the past half-dozen years his best smiles often failed to mellow her  expression. He felt that something disagreeable was coming.    \"Why did Cornwall run away this morning? I hoped to take him on a trip.\"    \"He had business to do.\"    His diversion had been a distinct failure, and had been turned against  him. For she went on: \"Which leads to what I have to say. You're going  back to New York in a few days, I suppose?\"    \"No, my dear. I haven't been across the water for two years.\"    \"Paris?\"    \"Brussels. A little less grace; a little more spirit.\"    \"Which means money.\"    \"A few thousand only. I'll be back by fall.\"    \"Do you know that you'll have to mortgage your future for that money,  Vance?\"    He blinked at her, but maintained his smile under fire courageously.    \"Come, come! Things are booming. You told me yesterday what you'd clean  up on the last bunch of Herefords.\"    When she folded her hands, she was most dangerous, he knew. And now the  bony fingers linked and she shrugged the shawl more closely around her  shoulders.    \"We're partners, aren't we?\" smiled Vance.    \"Partners, yes. You have one share and I have a thousand. But--you don't  want to sell out your final claim, I suppose?\"    His smile froze. \"Eh?\"    \"If you want to get those few thousands, Vance, you have nothing to put  up for them except your last shreds of property. That's why I say you'll  have to mortgage your future for money from now on.\"    \"But--how does it all come about?\"    \"I've warned you. I've been warning you for twenty-five years, Vance.\"    Once again he attempted to turn her. He always had the impression that if  he became serious, deadly serious for ten consecutive minutes with his  sister, he would be ruined. He kept on with his semi-jovial tone.    \"There are two arts, Elizabeth. One is making money and the other is  spending it. You've mastered one and I've mastered the other. Which  balances things, don't you think?\"    She did not melt; he waved down to the farm land.    \"Watch that wave of wind, Elizabeth.\"    A gust struck the scattering of aspens, and turned up the silver of the  dark green leaves. The breeze rolled across the trees in a long, rippling  flash of light. But Elizabeth did not look down. Her glance was fixed on  the changeless snow of Mount Discovery's summit.    \"As long as you have something to spend, spending is a very important  art, Vance. But when the purse is empty, it's a bit useless, it seems to  me.\"    \"Well, then, I'll have to mortgage my future. As a matter of fact, I  suppose I could borrow what I want on my prospects.\"    A veritable Indian yell, instantly taken up and prolonged by a chorus of  similar shouts, cut off the last of his words. Round the corner of the  house shot a blood-bay stallion, red as the red of iron under the  blacksmith's hammer, with a long, black tail snapping and flaunting  behind him, his ears flattened, his beautiful vicious head outstretched  in an effort to tug the reins out of the hands of the rider. Failing in  that effort, he leaped into the air like a steeplechaser and pitched down  upon stiffened forelegs.    The shock rippled through the body of the rider and came to his head with  a snap that jerked his chin down against his breast. The stallion rocked  back on his hind legs, whirled, and then flung himself deliberately on  his back. A sufficiently cunning maneuver--first stunning the enemy with  a blow and then crushing him before his senses returned. But he landed on  nothing save hard gravel. The rider had whipped out of the saddle and  stood poised, strong as the trunk of a silver spruce.    The fighting horse, a little shaken by the impact of his fall,  nevertheless whirled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#2)"],[1," words did not escape  the listeners.    \"How far are we from Fort Henry?\" asked Sheppard.    \"Eighteen miles as a crow flies; longer by trail.\"    \"Treachery!\" exclaimed the old man. \"We were no more than that this  morning. It is indeed fortunate that you found us. I take it you are  from Fort Henry, and will guide us there? I am an old friend of  Colonel Zane's. He will appreciate any kindness you may show us. Of  course you know him?\"    \"I am Jonathan Zane.\"    Sheppard suddenly realized that he was facing the most celebrated  scout on the border. In Revolutionary times Zane's fame had extended  even to the far Atlantic Colonies.    \"And your companion?\" asked Sheppard with keen interest. He guessed  what might be told. Border lore coupled Jonathan Zane with a strange  and terrible character, a border Nemesis, a mysterious, shadowy,  elusive man, whom few pioneers ever saw, but of whom all knew.    \"Wetzel,\" answered Zane.    With one accord the travelers gazed curiously at Zane's silent  companion. In the dim background of the glow cast by the fire, he  stood a gigantic figure, dark, quiet, and yet with something  intangible in his shadowy outline.    Suddenly he appeared to merge into the gloom as if he really were a  phantom. A warning, \"Hist!\" came from the bushes.    With one swift kick Zane scattered the camp-fire.    The travelers waited with bated breaths. They could hear nothing save  the beating of their own hearts; they could not even see each other.    \"Better go to sleep,\" came in Zane's calm voice. What a relief it was!  \"We'll keep watch, an' at daybreak guide you to Fort Henry.\"          CHAPTER II    Colonel Zane, a rugged, stalwart pioneer, with a strong, dark face,  sat listening to his old friend's dramatic story. At its close a  genial smile twinkled in his fine dark eyes.    \"Well, well, Sheppard, no doubt it was a thrilling adventure to you,\"  he said. \"It might have been a little more interesting, and doubtless  would, had I not sent Wetzel and Jonathan to look you up.\"    \"You did? How on earth did you know I was on the border? I counted  much on the surprise I should give you.\"    \"My Indian runners leave Fort Pitt ahead of any travelers, and  acquaint me with particulars.\"    \"I remembered a fleet-looking Indian who seemed to be asking for  information about us, when we arrived at Fort Pitt. I am sorry I did  not take the fur-trader's advice in regard to the guide. But I was in  such a hurry to come, and didn't feel able to bear the expense of a  raft or boat that we might come by river. My nephew brought  considerable gold, and I all my earthly possessions.\"    \"All's well that ends well,\" replied Colonel Zane cheerily. \"But we  must thank Providence that Wetzel and Jonathan came up in the nick  of time.\"    \"Indeed, yes. I'm not likely to forget those fierce savages. How they  slipped off into the darkness! I wonder if Wetzel pursued them? He  disappeared last night, and we did not see him again. In fact we  hardly had a fair look at him. I question if I should recognize him  now, unless by his great stature.\"    \"He was ahead of Jonathan on the trail. That is Wetzel's way. In times  of danger he is seldom seen, yet is always near. But come, let us go  out and look around. I am running up a log cabin which will come in  handy for you.\"    They passed out into the shade of pine and maples. A winding path led  down a gentle slope. On the hillside under a spreading tree a throng  of bearded pioneers, clad in faded buckskins and wearing white-ringed  coonskin caps, were erecting a log cabin.    \"Life here on the border is keen, hard, invigorating,\" said Colonel  Zane. \"I tell you, George Sheppard, in spite of your gray hair and  your pretty daughter, you have come out West because you want to live  among men who do things.\"    \"Colonel, I won't gainsay I've still got hot blood,\" replied Sheppard;  \"but I came to Fort Henry for land. My old home in Williamsburg has  fallen into ruin together with the fortunes of my family. I brought my  daughter and my nephew because I wanted them to take root in  new soil.\"    \"Well, George, right glad we are to have you. Where are your sons? I  remember them, though 'tis sixteen long years since I left old  Williamsburg.\"    \"Gone. The Revolution took my sons. Helen is the last of the family.\"    \"Well, well, indeed that's hard. Independence has cost you colonists  as big a price as border-freedom has us pioneers. Come, old friend,  forget the past. A new life begins for you here, and it will be one  which gives you much. See, up goes a cabin; that will soon be  your home.\"    Sheppard's eye marked the sturdy pioneers and a fast diminishing pile  of white-oak logs.    \"Ho-heave!\" cried a brawny foreman.    A dozen stout shoulders sagged beneath a well-trimmed log.    \"Ho-heave!\" yelled the foreman.    \"See, up she goes,\" cried the colonel, \"and to-morrow night she'll  shed rain.\"    They walked down a sandy lane bounded on the right by a wide, green  clearing, and on the left by a line of chestnuts and maples, outposts  of the thick forests beyond.    \"Yours is a fine site for a house,\" observed Sheppard, taking in the  clean-trimmed field that extended up the hillside, a brook that  splashed clear and noisy over the stones to tarry in a little  grass-bound lake which forced water through half-hollowed logs into a  spring house.    \"I think so; this is the fourth time I've put up a' cabin on this  land,\" replied the colonel.    \"How's that?\"    \"The redskins are keen to burn things.\"    Sheppard laughed at the pioneer's reply. \"It's not difficult, Colonel  Zane, to understand why Fort Henry has stood all these years, with you  as its leader. Certainly the location for your cabin is the finest in  the settlement. What a view!\"    High upon a bluff overhanging the majestic, slow-winding Ohio, the  colonel's cabin afforded a commanding position from which to view the  picturesque valley. Sheppard's eye first caught the outline of the  huge, bold, time-blackened fort which frowned protectingly over  surrounding log-cabins; then he saw the wide-sweeping river with its  verdant islands, golden, sandy bars, and willow-bordered shores, while  beyond, rolling pastures of wavy grass merging into green forests that  swept upward with slow swell until lost in the dim purple of distant  mountains.    \"Sixteen years ago I came out of the thicket upon yonder bluff, and  saw this valley. I was deeply impressed by its beauty, but more by its  wonderful promise.\"    \"Were you alone?\"    \"I and my dog. There had been a few white men before me on the river;  but I was the first to see this glorious valley from the bluff. Now,  George, I'll let you have a hundred acres of well-cleared land. The  soil is so rich you can raise two crops in one season. With some  stock, and a few good hands, you'll soon be a busy man.\"    \"I didn't expect so much land; I can't well afford to pay for it.\"    \"Talk to me of payment when the farm yields an income. Is this young  nephew of yours strong and willing?\"    \"He is, and has gold enough to buy a big farm.\"    \"Let him keep his money, and make a comfortable home for some good  lass. We marry our young people early out here. And your daughter,  George, is she fitted for this hard border life?\"    \"Never fear for Helen.\"    \"The brunt of this pioneer work falls on our women. God bless them,  how heroic they've been! The life here is rough for a man, let alone a  woman. But it is a man's game. We need girls, girls who will bear  strong men. Yet I am always saddened when I see one come out on  the border.\"    \"I think I knew what I was bringing Helen to, and she didn't flinch,\"  said Sheppard, somewhat surprised at the tone in which the  colonel spoke.    \"No one knows until he has lived on the border. Well, well, all this  is discouraging to you. Ah! here is Miss Helen with my sister.\"    The colonel's fine, dark face lost its sternness, and brightened with  a smile.    \"I hope you rested well after your long ride.\"    \"I am seldom tired, and I have been made most comfortable. I thank you  and your sister,\" replied the girl, giving Colonel Zane her hand, and  including both him and his sister in her grateful glance.    The colonel's sister was a slender, handsome young woman, whose dark  beauty showed to most effective advantage by the contrast with her  companion's fair skin, golden hair, and blue eyes.    Beautiful as was Helen Sheppard, it was her eyes that held Colonel  Zane irresistibly. They were unusually large, of a dark purple-blue  that changed, shaded, shadowed with her every thought.    \"Come, let us walk,\" Colonel Zane said abruptly, and, with Mr.  Sheppard, followed the girls down the path. He escorted them to the  fort, showed a long room with little squares cut in the rough-hewn  logs, many bullet holes, fire-charred timbers, and dark stains,  terribly suggestive of the pain and heroism which the defense of that  rude structure had cost.    Under Helen's eager questioning Colonel Zane yielded to his weakness  for story-telling, and recited the history of the last siege of Fort  Henry; how the renegade Girty swooped down upon the settlement with  hundreds of Indians and British soldiers; how for three days of  whistling bullets, flaming arrows, screeching demons, fire, smoke, and  attack following attack, the brave defenders stood at their posts,  there to die before yielding.    \"Grand!\" breathed Helen, and her eyes glowed. \"It was then Betty Zane  ran with the powder? Oh! I've heard the story.\"    \"Let my sister tell you of that,\" said the colonel, smiling.    \"You! Was it you?\" And Helen's eyes glowed brighter with the light of  youth's glory in great deeds.    \"My sister has been wedded and widowed since then,\" said Colonel Zane,  reading in Helen's earnest scrutiny of his sister's calm, sad face a  wonder if this quiet woman could be the fearless and famed  Elizabeth Zane.    Impulsively Helen's hand closed"]]]
