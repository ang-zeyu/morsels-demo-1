These copies, at any rate neither give  us the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do  they afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;  indeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than  satisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler  of the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all  the published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead  of arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a  suggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct  parts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the  mistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of  the compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to  the present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this  order--or rather disorder.    I, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the  Trattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I  was enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his  Manuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original  text of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent  library at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment  only--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,  it gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first  origin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive  researches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results  of which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by  the unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the  Manuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to  reproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by  the process of \"photogravure\". Her Majesty the Queen graciously  accorded me special permission to copy for publication the  Manuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale  Administrative de l'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most  liberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic  Leighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free  permission to work for several months in their private collection at  deciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which  Lord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the  Earl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the  Ambrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by  other private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo's; as also by the  Directors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the  Uffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British  Museum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted  to the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance  in my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of  the Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian  Library, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British  Museum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere  Bayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.  Napier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.    In correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the  advantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,  Senatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The  translation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into  English, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of  several of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in  the second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken  in this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my  thanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly  assisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.    The notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II  I owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.    I may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the  negatives for the production of the \"photo-gravures\" by Monsieur  Dujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.    It is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here  reproduced in facsimile have never been published before. As I am  now, on the termination of a work of several years' duration, in a  position to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may  perhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the  value of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to  nothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,  that we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a  Painter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There  can be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and  discoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of  modern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this  reason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be  appreciated in our own time than they could have been during the  preceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having  squandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,  having hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the  labours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation  of some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.    Alexander von Humboldt has borne witness that \"he was the first to  start on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our  senses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature\" Nay, yet more  may be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of  Alexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most  appropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo's  genius:    \"Majestati naturae par ingenium.\"    LONDON, April 1883.

Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according  to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child;  concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might--and  did--speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed  strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a  contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to  mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous  future.    Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a  lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and  trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited  through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to  pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was  filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had  taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old  Whateley's reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by  violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not  helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences,  Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular  occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a  home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since  disappeared.    There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises  and the dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor  or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbors knew nothing of him till  a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow  into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of  loungers at Osborn's general store. There seemed to be a change in the  old man--an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which  subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear--though he  was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all  he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and  what he said of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his  hearers years afterward.    \"I dun't keer what folks think--ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa, he  wouldn't look like nothin' ye expeck. Ye needn't think the only folks  is the folks hereabouts. Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things  the most o' ye only tell abaout. I calc'late her man is as good a  husban' as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much  abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast no better church weddin' nor  her'n. Let me tell ye suthin'--_some day yew folks'll hear a child o'  Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!_\"    The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life  were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl  Sawyer's common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie's visit was frankly one  of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations;  but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley  had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of  cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur's family which ended only  in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did  the ramshackle Whateley barn seem over-crowded with livestock. There  came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count  the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old  farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anemic,  bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper,  perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi  and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the  Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect  of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice  during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern  similar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaven old man and his  slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.    In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary  rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy  child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the  country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the  swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit.  Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his  birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in  infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds  showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant,  and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to  walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to  remove.    It was somewhat after this time--on Hallowe'en--that a great blaze was  seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like  stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk  was started when Silas Bishop--of the undecayed Bishops--mentioned  having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother  about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a  stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied  the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost  noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed  to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure  about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair  of dark blue trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen  alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the  disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to  fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and  grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror  of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.    The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that  \"Lavinny's black brat\" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only  eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its  difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it  displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of  three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when  he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed  by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he  said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked  with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the  spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity;  for though he shared his mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his  firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression on his  large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood  and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly  ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost  goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish  skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon  disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all  conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic  of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the  dreadful name of _Yog-Sothoth_ in the midst of a circle of stones with  a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and  he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their  barking menace.      3    Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably  increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to  repair the unused parts of his house--a spacious, peaked-roofed affair  whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose  three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for  himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves  of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard  labor; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry  seemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had really begun  as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been  put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock.  Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no  less thorough craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight  boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section--though many  declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at  all. Less inexplicable was his fitting-up of another downstairs room  for his new grandson--a room which several callers saw, though no one  was ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper story. This chamber  he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to  arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and  parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously  in odd corners of the various rooms.    \"I made some use of 'em,\" he would say as he tried to mend a torn  black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \"but  the boy's fitten to make better use of 'em. He'd orter hev 'em as well  sot as he kin for they're goin' to be all of his larnin'.\"    When Wilbur was a year and seven months old--in September of 1914--his  size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as  a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker.  He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother  on "]]]
