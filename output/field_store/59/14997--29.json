Being settled  then in the metropolis of his own country, and esteemed the chief  provincial of the Jesuits in England, it was taken notice of, that  he affected more the exterior shew of a lord, than the humility of a  priest, keeping as grand an equipage, as money could then furnish him  with. Dr. Fuller says, that our author was executed in the reign of  Queen Elizabeth; but Sir Richard Baker tells us, that he was one of  the chief of those 70 priests that were taken in the year 1585; and  when some of them were condemned, and the rest in danger of the law,  her Majesty caused them all to be shipp'd away, and sent out of  England. Upon Heywood's being taken and committed to prison, and the  earl of Warwick thereupon ready to relieve his necessity, he made a  copy of verses, mentioned by Sir John Harrington, concluding with  these two;      ----Thanks to that lord, that wills me good;    For I want all things, saving hay and wood.    He afterwards went to Rome, and at last settled in the city of Naples,  where he became familiarly known to that zealous Roman Catholick, John  Pitceus, who speaks of him with great respect.    It is unknown what he wrote or published after he became a Jesuit. It  is said that he was a great critic in the Hebrew language, and that he  digested an easy and short method, (reduced into tables) for novices  to learn that language, which Wood supposes was a compendium of a  Hebrew grammar. Our author paid the common debt of nature at Naples,  1598, and was buried in the college of Jesuits there.      [Footnote 1: Langb. Lives of the Poets, p. 249.]    [Footnote 2: Langb. ubi supra.]    [Footnote 3: Athen. Oxon.]           *       *       *       *       *      JOHN LILLY,    A writer who flourished in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; he was a  Kentish man, and in his younger years educated at St. Mary Magdalen  College in Oxon, where in the year 1575 he took his degree of Master  of Arts. He was, says Langbaine, a very close student, and much  addicted to poetry; a proof of which he has given to the world, in  those plays which he has bequeathed to posterity, and which in that  age were well esteemed, both by the court, and by the university. He  was one of the first writers, continues Langbain, who in those  days attempted to reform the language, and purge it from obsolete  expressions. Mr. Blount, a gentleman who has made himself known to the  world, by several pieces of his own writing (as Horae Subsecivae, his  Microcosmography, &c.) and who published six of these plays, in his  title page stiles him, the only rare poet of that time, the witty,  comical, facetiously quick, and unparallell'd John Lilly. Mr. Blount  further says, 'That he sat 'at Apollo's table; that Apollo gave him a  wreath of his own bays without snatching; and that the Lyre he played  on, had no borrowed strings:' He mentions a romance of our author's  writing, called Euphues; our nation, says he, are in his debt, for a  new English which he taught them; Euphues, and his England began first  that language, and all our ladies were then his scholars, and that  beauty in court who could not read Euphism, was as little regarded,  as she who now speaks not French. This extraordinary Romance I  acknowledge I have not read, so cannot from myself give it a  character, but I have some reason to believe, that it was a miserable  performance, from the authority of the author of the British Theatre,  who in his preface thus speaks of it; \"This Romance, says he, so  fashionable for its wit; so famous in the court of Queen Elizabeth,  and is said to have introduced so remarkable a change in our language,  I have seen and read. It is an unnatural affected jargon, in which the  perpetual use of metaphors, allusions, allegories, and analogies,  is to pass for wit, and stiff bombast for language; and with this  nonsense the court of Queen Elizabeth (whose times afforded better  models for stile and composition, than almost any since) became  miserably infected, and greatly help'd to let in all the vile pedantry  of language in the two following reigns; so much mischief the most  ridiculous instrument may do, when he proposes to improve on the  simplicity of nature.\"    Mr. Lilly has writ the following dramatic pieces;    Alexander and Campaspe, a tragical comedy; play'd before the Queen's  Majesty on twelfth-night, by her Majesty's children, and the children  of St. Paul's, and afterwards at the Black Fryars; printed in 12mo.  London, 1632. The story of Alexander's bestowing Campaspe, in the  enamoured Apelles, is related by Pliny in his Natural History. Lib.  xxxv. L. x.    Endymion, a Comedy, presented before Queen Elizabeth, by the children  of her Majesty's chaple, printed in 12mo. 1632. The story of  Endymion's being beloved by the moon, with comments upon it, may be  met with in most of the Mythologists. See Lucian's Dialogues, between  Venus and the Moon. Mr. Gambauld has writ a romance called Endymion,  translated into English, 8vo. 1639.    Galathea, a Comedy, played before the Queen at Greenwich on New year's  day, at night, by the children of St. Paul's, printed in 12mo. London,  1632. In the characters of Galathea and Philidia, the poet has copied  the story of Iphis and Ianthe, which the reader may find at large in  the ninth book of Ovid's Metamorphosis.    Maid's Metamorphosis, a Comedy, acted by the children of St. Paul's,  printed in 12mo. 1632.    Mydas, a Comedy, played before the Queen on Twelfth-night, printed  in 12mo. London, 1632. For the story, see the xith book of Ovid's  Metamorphosis.    Sappho and Phaon, a Comedy, played before the queen on Shrove-Tuesday,  by the children of Paul's, and afterwards at Black-Fryars, printed  in Twelves, London 1632. This story the reader may learn from Ovid's  Epistles, of Sappho to Phaon, Ep. 21.    Woman in the Moon, presented before the Queen, London 1667. Six of  these plays, viz. Alexander and Campaspe, Endymion, Galathea and  Mydas, Sappho and Phaon, with Mother Bombie, a Comedy, by the  same author, are printed together under the title of the Six  Court-Comedies, 12mo, London 1632, and dedicated by Mr. Blount, to the  lord viscount Lumly of Waterford; the other two are printed singly  in Quarto.----He also wrote Loves Metamorphosis, a courtly pastoral,  printed 1601.           *       *       *       *       *      Sir THOMAS OVERBURY    Was son of Nicholas Overbury, Esq; of Burton in Gloucestershire, one  of the Judges of the Marches[1]. He was born with very bright parts,  and gave early discoveries of a rising genius. In 1595, the 14th year  of his age, he became a gentleman commoner in Queen's-College in  Oxford, and in 1598, as a 'squire's son, he took the degree of  batchelor of arts; he removed from thence to the Middle-Temple, in  order to study the municipal law, but did not long remain there[2].  His genius, which was of a sprightly kind, could not bear the  confinement of a student, or the drudgery of reading law; he abandoned  it therefore, and travelled into France, where he so improved himself  in polite accomplishments, that when he returned he was looked upon as  one of the most finished gentlemen about court.    Soon after his arrival in England, he contracted an intimacy, which  afterwards grew into friendship with Sir Robert Carre, a Scotch  gentleman, a favourite with king James, and afterwards earl of  Somerset. Such was the warmth of friendship in which these two  gentlemen lived, that they were inseparable. Carre could enter into no  scheme, nor pursue any measures, without the advice and concurrence of  Overbury, nor could Overbury enjoy any felicity but in the company of  him he loved; their friendship was the subject of court-conversation,  and their genius seemed so much alike, that it was reasonable to  suppose no breach could ever be produced between them; but such it  seems is the power of woman, such the influence of beauty, that even  the sacred ties of friendship are broke asunder by the magic energy of  these superior charms. Carre fell in love with lady Frances Howard,  daughter to the Earl of Suffolk, and lately divorced from the Earl  of Essex[3]. He communicated his passion to his friend, who was too  penetrating not to know that no man could live with much comfort, with  a woman of the Countess's stamp, of whose morals he had a bad opinion;  he insinuated to Carre some suspicions, and those well founded,  against her honour; he dissuaded him with all the warmth of the  sincerest friendship, to desist from a match that would involve him in  misery, and not to suffer his passion for her beauty to have so much  sway over him, as to make him sacrifice his peace to its indulgence.    Carre, who was desperately in love, forgetting the ties of honour as  well as friendship, communicated to the lady, what Overbury had said  of her, and they who have read the heart of woman, will be at no loss  to conceive what reception she gave that unwelcome report. She knew,  that Carre was immoderately attached to Overbury, that he was directed  by his Council in all things, and devoted to his interest.      Earth has no curse like love to hatred turn'd,    Nor Hell a fury like a woman scorn'd.    This was literally verified in the case of the countess; she let loose  all the rage of which she was capable against him, and as she panted  for the consummation of the match between Carre and her, she so  influenced the Viscount, that he began to conceive a hatred likewise  to Overbury; and while he was thus subdued by the charms of a wicked  woman, he seemed to change his nature, and from the gentle, easy,  accessible, good-natured man he formerly appeared, he degenerated into  the sullen, vindictive, and implacable.

Many times had Tarzan behaved similarly in the village of Mbonga, the  chief.  His mysterious and unexpected appearances always filled the  breasts of the poor, superstitious blacks with the panic of terror;  never, it seemed, could they accustom themselves to the sight of him.  It was this terror which lent to the adventures the spice of interest  and amusement which the human mind of the ape-man craved.  Merely to  kill was not in itself sufficient.  Accustomed to the sight of death,  Tarzan found no great pleasure in it.  Long since had he avenged the  death of Kala, but in the accomplishment of it, he had learned the  excitement and the pleasure to be derived from the baiting of the  blacks.  Of this he never tired.    It was just as he was about to spring forward with a savage roar that a  figure appeared in the doorway of the hut.  It was the figure of the  wailer whom he had come to still, the figure of a young woman with a  wooden skewer through the split septum of her nose, with a heavy metal  ornament depending from her lower lip, which it had dragged down to  hideous and repulsive deformity, with strange tattooing upon forehead,  cheeks, and breasts, and a wonderful coiffure built up with mud and  wire.    A sudden flare of the fire threw the grotesque figure into high relief,  and Tarzan recognized her as Momaya, the mother of Tibo.  The fire also  threw out a fitful flame which carried to the shadows where Tarzan  lurked, picking out his light brown body from the surrounding darkness.  Momaya saw him and knew him.  With a cry, she leaped forward and Tarzan  came to meet her.  The other women, turning, saw him, too; but they did  not come toward him.  Instead they rose as one, shrieked as one, fled  as one.    Momaya threw herself at Tarzan's feet, raising supplicating hands  toward him and pouring forth from her mutilated lips a perfect cataract  of words, not one of which the ape-man comprehended.  For a moment he  looked down upon the upturned, frightful face of the woman.  He had  come to slay, but that overwhelming torrent of speech filled him with  consternation and with awe.  He glanced about him apprehensively, then  back at the woman.  A revulsion of feeling seized him.  He could not  kill little Tibo's mother, nor could he stand and face this verbal  geyser.  With a quick gesture of impatience at the spoiling of his  evening's entertainment, he wheeled and leaped away into the darkness.  A moment later he was swinging through the black jungle night, the  cries and lamentations of Momaya growing fainter in the distance.    It was with a sigh of relief that he finally reached a point from which  he could no longer hear them, and finding a comfortable crotch high  among the trees, composed himself for a night of dreamless slumber,  while a prowling lion moaned and coughed beneath him, and in far-off  England the other Lord Greystoke, with the assistance of a valet,  disrobed and crawled between spotless sheets, swearing irritably as a  cat meowed beneath his window.    As Tarzan followed the fresh spoor of Horta, the boar, the following  morning, he came upon the tracks of two Gomangani, a large one and a  small one.  The ape-man, accustomed as he was to questioning closely  all that fell to his perceptions, paused to read the story written in  the soft mud of the game trail.  You or I would have seen little of  interest there, even if, by chance, we could have seen aught.  Perhaps  had one been there to point them out to us, we might have noted  indentations in the mud, but there were countless indentations, one  overlapping another into a confusion that would have been entirely  meaningless to us.  To Tarzan each told its own story.  Tantor, the  elephant, had passed that way as recently as three suns since.  Numa  had hunted here the night just gone, and Horta, the boar, had walked  slowly along the trail within an hour; but what held Tarzan's attention  was the spoor tale of the Gomangani.  It told him that the day before  an old man had gone toward the north in company with a little boy, and  that with them had been two hyenas.    Tarzan scratched his head in puzzled incredulity.  He could see by the  overlapping of the footprints that the beasts had not been following  the two, for sometimes one was ahead of them and one behind, and again  both were in advance, or both were in the rear.  It was very strange  and quite inexplicable, especially where the spoor showed where the  hyenas in the wider portions of the path had walked one on either side  of the human pair, quite close to them.  Then Tarzan read in the spoor  of the smaller Gomangani a shrinking terror of the beast that brushed  his side, but in that of the old man was no sign of fear.    At first Tarzan had been solely occupied by the remarkable  juxtaposition of the spoor of Dango and Gomangani, but now his keen  eyes caught something in the spoor of the little Gomangani which  brought him to a sudden stop.  It was as though, finding a letter in  the road, you suddenly had discovered in it the familiar handwriting of  a friend.    \"Go-bu-balu!\" exclaimed the ape-man, and at once memory flashed upon  the screen of recollection the supplicating attitude of Momaya as she  had hurled herself before him in the village of Mbonga the night  before.  Instantly all was explained--the wailing and lamentation, the  pleading of the black mother, the sympathetic howling of the shes about  the fire.  Little Go-bu-balu had been stolen again, and this time by  another than Tarzan.  Doubtless the mother had thought that he was  again in the power of Tarzan of the Apes, and she had been beseeching  him to return her balu to her.    Yes, it was all quite plain now; but who could have stolen Go-bu-balu  this time? Tarzan wondered, and he wondered, too, about the presence of  Dango.  He would investigate.  The spoor was a day old and it ran  toward the north.  Tarzan set out to follow it.  In places it was  totally obliterated by the passage of many beasts, and where the way  was rocky, even Tarzan of the Apes was almost baffled; but there was  still the faint effluvium which clung to the human spoor, appreciable  only to such highly trained perceptive powers as were Tarzan's.      It had all happened to little Tibo very suddenly and unexpectedly  within the brief span of two suns.  First had come Bukawai, the  witch-doctor--Bukawai, the unclean--with the ragged bit of flesh which  still clung to his rotting face.  He had come alone and by day to the  place at the river where Momaya went daily to wash her body and that of  Tibo, her little boy.  He had stepped out from behind a great bush  quite close to Momaya, frightening little Tibo so that he ran screaming  to his mother's protecting arms.    But Momaya, though startled, had wheeled to face the fearsome thing  with all the savage ferocity of a she-tiger at bay.  When she saw who  it was, she breathed a sigh of partial relief, though she still clung  tightly to Tibo.    \"I have come,\" said Bukawai without preliminary, \"for the three fat  goats, the new sleeping mat, and the bit of copper wire as long as a  tall man's arm.\"    \"I have no goats for you,\" snapped Momaya, \"nor a sleeping mat, nor any  wire.  Your medicine was never made.  The white jungle god gave me back  my Tibo.  You had nothing to do with it.\"    \"But I did,\" mumbled Bukawai through his fleshless jaws.  \"It was I who  commanded the white jungle god to give back your Tibo.\"    Momaya laughed in his face.  \"Speaker of lies,\" she cried, \"go back to  your foul den and your hyenas.  Go back and hide your stinking face in  the belly of the mountain, lest the sun, seeing it, cover his face with  a black cloud.\"    \"I have come,\" reiterated Bukawai, \"for the three fat goats, the new  sleeping mat, and the bit of copper wire the length of a tall man's  arm, which you were to pay me for the return of your Tibo.\"    \"It was to be the length of a man's forearm,\" corrected Momaya, \"but  you shall have nothing, old thief.  You would not make medicine until I  had brought the payment in advance, and when I was returning to my  village the great, white jungle god gave me back my Tibo--gave him to  me out of the jaws of Numa.  His medicine is true medicine--yours is  the weak medicine of an old man with a hole in his face.\"    \"I have come,\" repeated Bukawai patiently, \"for the three fat--\" But  Momaya had not waited to hear more of what she already knew by heart.  Clasping Tibo close to her side, she was hurrying away toward the  palisaded village of Mbonga, the chief.    And the next day, when Momaya was working in the plantain field with  others of the women of the tribe, and little Tibo had been playing at  the edge of the jungle, casting a small spear in anticipation of the  distant day when he should be a full-fledged warrior, Bukawai had come  again.    Tibo had seen a squirrel scampering up the bole of a great tree.  His  childish mind had transformed it into the menacing figure of a hostile  warrior.  Little Tibo had raised his tiny spear, his heart filled with  the savage blood lust of his race, as he pictured the night's orgy when  he should dance about the corpse of his human kill as the women of his  tribe prepared the meat for the feast to follow.    But when he cast the spear, he missed both squirrel and tree, losing  his missile far among the tangled undergrowth of the jungle.  However,  it could be but a few steps within the forbidden labyrinth.  The women  were all about in the field.  There were warriors on guard within easy  hail, and so little Tibo boldly ventured into the dark place.    Just behind the screen of creepers and matted foliage lurked three  horrid figures--an old, old man, black as the pit, with a face half  eaten away by leprosy, his sharp-filed teeth, the teeth of"]]]
