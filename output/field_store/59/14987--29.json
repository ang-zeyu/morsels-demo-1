They were heading for some freight-cars that stood upon a  side-track. The dark figures disappeared behind them. Then one figure  reappeared, coming back. Kurt crouched low. This man passed within a few  yards of Kurt and he was whispering to himself. After he was safely out  of earshot Kurt stole on stealthily until he reached the end of the  freight-cars. Here he paused, listening. He thought he heard low voices,  but he could not see the men he was following. No doubt they were  waiting in the secluded gloom for the other men apparently necessary for  that secret conference. Kurt had sensed this event and he had determined  to be present. He tried not to conjecture. It was best for him to apply  all his faculties to the task of slipping unseen and unheard close to  these men who had involved his father in some dark plot.    Not long after Kurt hid himself on the other side of the freight-car he  heard soft-padded footsteps and subdued voices. Dark shapes appeared to  come out of the gloom. They passed him. He distinguished low, guttural  voices, speaking German. These men, three in number, were scarcely out  of sight when Kurt laid his rifle on the projecting shelf of the  freight-car and followed them.    Presently he came to deep shadow, where he paused. Low voices drew him  on again, then a light made him thrill. Now and then the light appeared  to be darkened by moving figures. A dark object loomed up to cut off  Kurt's view. It was a pile of railroad ties, and beyond it loomed  another. Stealing along these, he soon saw the light again, quite close.  By its glow he recognized his father's huge frame, back to him, and the  burly Neuman on the other side, and Glidden, whose dark face was working  as he talked. These three were sitting, evidently on a flat pile of  ties, and the other two men stood behind. Kurt could not make out the  meaning of the low voices. Pressing closer to the freight-car, he  cautiously and noiselessly advanced.    Glidden was importuning with expressive hands and swift, low utterance.  His face gleamed dark, hard, strong, intensely strung with corded,  quivering muscles, with eyes apparently green orbs of fire. He spoke in  German.    Kurt dared not go closer unless he wanted to be discovered, and not yet  was he ready for that. He might hear some word to help explain his  father's strange, significant intimations about Anderson.    \"...must--have--money,\" Glidden was saying. To Kurt's eyes treachery  gleamed in that working face. Neuman bent over to whisper gruffly in  Dorn's ear. One of the silent men standing rubbed his hands together.  Old Dorn's head was bowed. Then Glidden spoke so low and so swiftly that  Kurt could not connect sentences, but with mounting blood he stood  transfixed and horrified, to gather meaning from word on word, until he  realized Anderson's doom, with other rich men of the Northwest, was  sealed--that there were to be burnings of wheat-fields and of  storehouses and of freight-trains--destruction everywhere.    \"I give money,\" said old Dorn, and with heavy movement he drew from  inside his coat a large package wrapped in newspaper. He laid it before  him in the light and began to unwrap it. Soon there were disclosed two  bundles of bills--the eighty thousand dollars.    Kurt thrilled in all his being. His poor father was being misled and  robbed. A melancholy flash of comfort came to Kurt! Then at sight of  Glidden's hungry eyes and working face and clutching hands Kurt pulled  his hat far down, drew his revolver, and leaped forward with a yell,  \"Hands up!\"    He discharged the revolver right in the faces of the stunned plotters,  and, snatching up the bundle of money, he leaped over the light,  knocking one of the men down, and was gone into the darkness, without  having slowed in the least his swift action.    Wheeling round the end of the freight-car, he darted back, risking a  hard fall in the darkness, and ran along the several cars to the first  one, where he grasped his rifle and kept on. He heard his father's roar,  like that of a mad bull, and shrill yells from the other men. Kurt  laughed grimly. They would never catch him in the dark. While he ran he  stuffed the money into his inside coat pockets. Beyond the railroad  station he slowed down to catch his breath. His breast was heaving, his  pulse hammering, and his skin was streaming. The excitement was the  greatest under which he had ever labored.    \"Now--what shall--I do?\" he panted. A freight-train was lumbering toward  him and the head-light was almost at the station. The train appeared to  be going slowly through without stopping. Kurt hurried on down the track  a little farther. Then he waited. He would get on that train and make  his way somehow to Ruxton, there to warn Anderson of the plot against  his life.          CHAPTER X    Kurt rode to Adrian on that freight, and upon arriving in the yards  there he jumped off, only to mount another, headed south. He meant to be  traveling while it was dark. No passenger-trains ran at night and he  wanted to put as much distance between him and Wheatly as possible  before daylight.    He had piled into an open box-car. It was empty, at least of freight,  and the floor appeared to have a thin covering of hay. The train,  gathering headway, made a rattling rolling roar. Kurt hesitated about  getting up and groping back in the pitch-black corners of the car. He  felt that it contained a presence besides his own. And suddenly he was  startled by an object blacker than the shadow, that sidled up close to  him. Kurt could not keep the cold chills from chasing up and down his  back. The object was a man, who reached for Kurt and felt of him with a  skinny hand.    \"I.W.W.?\" he whispered, hoarsely, in Kurt's ear.    \"Yes,\" replied Kurt.    \"Was that Adrian where you got on?\"    \"It sure was,\" answered Kurt, with grim humor.    \"Than you're the feller?\"    \"Sure,\" replied Kurt. It was evident that he had embarked upon an  adventure.    \"When do we stall this freight?\"    \"Not while we're on it, you can gamble.\"    Other dark forms sidled out of the gloomy depths of that cavern-like  corner and drew close to Kurt. He realized that he had fallen in with  I.W.W. men who apparently had taken him for an expected messenger or  leader. He was importuned for tobacco, drink, and money, and he judged  that his begging companions consisted of an American tramp, an Austrian,  a negro, and a German. Fine society to fall into! That eighty thousand  dollars became a tremendous burden.    \"How many men on this freight?\" queried Kurt, thinking he could ask  questions better than answer them. And he was told there were about  twenty-five, all of whom expected money. At this information Kurt rather  closely pressed his hand upon the revolver in his side coat pocket. By  asking questions and making judicious replies he passed what he felt was  the dark mark in that mixed company of I.W.W. men; and at length, one by  one, they melted away to their warmer corners, leaving Kurt by the door.  He did not mind the cold. He wanted to be where, at the first indication  of a stop, he could jump off the train.    With his hand on his gun and hugging the bulging coat pockets close to  him, Kurt settled himself for what he believed would be interminable  hours. He strained eyes and ears for a possible attack from the riffraff  I.W.W. men hidden there in the car. And that was why, perhaps, that it  seemed only a short while until the train bumped and slowed, preparatory  to stopping. The instant it was safe Kurt jumped out and stole away in  the gloom. A fence obstructed further passage. He peered around to make  out that he was in a road. Thereupon he hurried along it until he was  out of hearing of the train. There was light in the east, heralding a  dawn that Kurt surely would welcome. He sat down to wait, and addressed  to his bewildered judgment a query as to whether or not he ought to keep  on carrying the burdensome rifle. It was not only heavy, but when  daylight came it might attract attention, and his bulging coat would  certainly invite curiosity. He was in a predicament; nevertheless, he  decided to hang on to the rifle.    He almost fell asleep, waiting there with his back against a fence-post.  The dawn came, and then the rosy sunrise. And he discovered, not half a  mile away, a good-sized town, where he believed he surely could hire an  automobile.    Waiting grew to be so tedious that he decided to risk the early hour,  and proceeded toward the town. Upon the outskirts he met a farmer boy,  who, in reply to a question, said that the town was Connell. Kurt found  another early riser in the person of a blacksmith who evidently was a  Yankee and proud of it. He owned a car that he was willing to hire out  on good security. Kurt satisfied him on that score, and then proceeded  to ask how to get across the Copper River and into Golden Valley. The  highway followed the railroad from that town to Kahlotus, and there  crossed a big trunk-line railroad, to turn south toward the river.    In half an hour, during which time Kurt was enabled to breakfast, the  car was ready. It was a large car, rather ancient and the worse for  wear, but its owner assured Kurt that it would take him where he wanted  to go and he need not be afraid to drive fast. With that inspiring  knowledge Kurt started off.    Before ten o'clock Kurt reached Kilo, far across the Copper River, with  the Blue Mountains in sight, and from there less confusing directions to  follow. He had been lucky. He had passed the wreck of the freight-train  upon which he had ridden from Adrian; his car had been surrounded by  rough men, and only quick wits saved him at least delay; he had been  hailed by more than one group of tramping I.W.W. men; and he had passed  camps and freight-yards where idlers were congregated. And lastly, he  had seen, far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#20)"],[1,"away the lime in the form of an impalpable white   mud, which fills up the interstices in the coral beds.    The bottom, just outside the reef, is covered with that mud, mixed   with more lime-mud, which the surge wears off the reef; and if you   have, as you should have, a dredge on board, and try a haul of that   mud as you row home, you may find, but not always, animal forms   rooted in it, which will delight the soul of a scientific man.  One,   I hope, would be some sort of Terebratula, or shell akin to it.  You   would probably think it a cockle:  but you would be wrong.  The   animal which dwells in it has about the same relationship to a cockle   as a dog has to a bird.  It is a Brachiopod; a family with which the   ancient seas once swarmed, but which is rare now, all over the world,   having been supplanted and driven out of the seas by newer and   stronger forms of shelled animals.  The nearest spot at which you are   likely to dredge a live Brachiopod will be in the deep water of Loch   Fyne, in Argyleshire, where two species still linger, fastened,   strangely enough, to the smooth pebbles of a submerged glacier,   formed in the open air during the age of ice, but sunk now to a depth   of eighty fathoms.  The first time I saw those shells come up in the   dredge out of the dark and motionless abyss, I could sympathise with   the feelings of mingled delight and awe which, so my companion told   me, the great Professor Owen had in the same spot first beheld the   same lingering remnants of a primaeval world.    The other might be (but I cannot promise you even a chance of   dredging that, unless you were off the coast of Portugal, or the   windward side of some of the West India Islands) a live Crinoid; an   exquisite starfish, with long and branching arms, but rooted in the   mud by a long stalk, and that stalk throwing out barren side   branches; the whole a living plant of stone.  You may see in museums   specimens of this family, now so rare, all but extinct.  And yet   fifty or a hundred different forms of the same type swarmed in the   ancient seas:  whole masses of limestone are made up of little else   but the fragments of such animals.    But we have not landed yet on the dry part of the reef.  Let us make   for it, taking care meanwhile that we do not get our feet cut by the   coral, or stung as by nettles by the coral insects.  We shall see   that the dry land is made up entirely of coral, ground and broken by   the waves, and hurled inland by the storm, sometimes in huge   boulders, mostly as fine mud; and that, under the influence of the   sun and of the rain, which filters through it, charged with lime from   the rotting coral, the whole is setting, as cement sets, into rock.    And what is this?  A long bank of stone standing up as a low cliff,   ten or twelve feet above high-water mark.  It is full of fragments of   shell, of fragments of coral, of all sorts of animal remains; and the   lower part of it is quite hard rock.  Moreover, it is bedded in   regular layers, just such as you see in a quarry.  But how did it get   there?  It must have been formed at the sea-level, some of it,   indeed, under the sea; for here are great masses of madrepore and   limestone corals imbedded just as they grew.  What lifted it up?    Your companions, if you have any who know the island, have no   difficulty in telling you.  It was hove up, they say, in the   earthquake in such and such a year; and they will tell you, perhaps,   that if you will go on shore to the main island which rises inside   the reef, you may see dead coral beds just like these lying on the   old rocks, and sloping up along the flanks of the mountains to   several hundred feet above the sea.  I have seen such many a time.    Thus you find the coral being converted gradually into a limestone   rock, either fine and homogeneous, composed of coral grown into pulp,   or filled with corals and shells, or with angular fragments of older   coral rock.  Did you never see that last?  No?  Yes, you have a   hundred times.  You have but to look at the marbles commonly used   about these islands, with angular fragments imbedded in the mass, and   here and there a shell, the whole cemented together by water holding   in solution carbonate of lime, and there see the very same phenomenon   perpetuated to this day.    Thus, I think, we have got first from the known to the unknown; from   a tropic coral island back here to the limestone hills of Great   Britain; and I did not speak at random when I said that I was not   leading you away as far as you fancied by several thousand miles.    Examine any average limestone quarry from Bristol to Berwick, and you   will see there all that I have been describing; that is, all of it   which is not soft animal matter, certain to decay.  You will see the   lime-mud hardened into rock beds; you will see the shells embedded in   it; you will see the corals in every stage of destruction; you will   see whole layers made up of innumerable fragments of Crinoids--no   wonder they are innumerable, for, it has been calculated, there are   in a single animal of some of the species 140,000 joints--140,000   bits of lime to fall apart when its soft parts decay.  But is it not   all there?  And why should it not have got there by the same process   by which similar old coral beds get up the mountain sides in the West   Indies and elsewhere; namely, by the upheaving force of earthquakes?    When you see similar effects, you have a right to presume similar   causes.  If you see a man fall off a house here, and break his neck;   and some years after, in London or New York, or anywhere else, find   another man lying at the foot of another house, with his neck broken   in the same way, is it not a very fair presumption that he has fallen   off a house likewise?    You may be wrong.  He may have come to his end by a dozen other   means:  but you must have proof of that.  You will have a full right,   in science and in common sense, to say--That man fell off the house,   till some one proves to you that he did not.    In fact, there is nothing which you see in the limestones of these   isles--save and except the difference in every shell and coral--which   you would not see in the coral-beds of the West Indies, if such   earthquakes as that famous one at St. Thomas's, in 1866, became   common and periodic, upheaving the land (they needs upheave it a very   little, only two hundred and fifty feet), till St. Thomas's, and all   the Virgin Isles, and the mighty mountain of Porto Rico, which looms   up dim and purple to the west, were all joined into dry land once   more, and the lonely coral-shoal of Anegada were raised, as it would   be raised then, into a limestone table-land, like that of Central   Ireland, of Galway, or of County Clare.    But you must clearly understand, that however much these coralline   limestones have been upheaved since they were formed, yet the sea-  bottom, while they were being formed, was sinking and not rising.    This is a fact which was first pointed out by Mr. Darwin, from the   observations which he made in the world-famous Voyage of the Beagle;   and the observations of subsequent great naturalists have all gone to   corroborate his theory.    It was supposed at first, you must understand, that when a coral   island rose steeply to the surface of the sea out of blue water,   perhaps a thousand fathoms or more, that fact was plain proof that   the little coral polypes had begun at the bottom of the sea, and, in   the course of ages, built up the whole island an enormous depth.    But it soon came out that that theory was not correct; for the coral   polypes cannot live and build save in shallow water--say in thirty to   forty fathoms.  Indeed, some of the strongest and largest species   work best at the very surface, and in the cut of the fiercest surf.    And so arose a puzzle as to how coral rock is often found of vast   thickness, which Mr. Darwin explained.  His theory was, and there is   no doubt now that it is correct, that in these cases the sea-bottom   is sinking; that as it sinks, carrying the coral beds down with it,   the coral dies, and a fresh live crop of polypes builds on the top of   the houses of their dead ancestors:  so that, as the depression goes   on, generation after generation builds upwards, the living on the   dead, keeping the upper surface of the reef at the same level, while   its base is sinking downward into the abyss.    Applying this theory to the coral reef of the Pacific Ocean, the   following interesting facts were made out:    That where you find an Island rising out of deep water, with a ring   of coral round it, a little way from the shore--or, as in Eastern   Australia, a coast with a fringing reef (the Flinders reef of   Australia is eleven thousand miles long)--that is a pretty sure sign   that that shore, or mountain, is sinking slowly beneath the sea.    That where you find, as you often do in the Pacific, a mere atoll, or   circular reef of coral, with a shallow pond of smooth water in the   centre, and deep sea round, that is a pretty sure sign that the   mountain-top has sunk completely into the sea, and that the corals   are going on building where its peak once was.    And more.  On working out the geography of the South Sea Islands by   the light of this theory of Mr. Darwin's, the following extraordinary   fact has been discovered:    That over a great part of the Pacific Ocean sinking is going on, and   has been going on for ages; and that the greater number of the   beautiful and precious South Sea Islands are only the remnants of a   vast continent or archipelago, which once stretched for thousands of   miles between Australia and South America.    Now, applying the same theory to limestone beds, which are, as you   know, only fossil coral reefs, we have a right to say, when we see in   England, Scotland, Ireland,"]]]
