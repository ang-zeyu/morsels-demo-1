As soon as the least  thing happens, the wife says: 'I release you. I am going to leave your  house.' Even among the moujiks this fashion has become acclimated.  'There,' she says, 'here are your shirts and drawers. I am going off  with Vanka. His hair is curlier than yours.' Just go talk with them. And  yet the first rule for the wife should be fear.\"    The clerk looked at the lawyer, the lady, and myself, evidently  repressing a smile, and all ready to deride or approve the merchant's  words, according to the attitude of the others.    \"What fear?\" said the lady.    \"This fear,--the wife must fear her husband; that is what fear.\"    \"Oh, that, my little father, that is ended.\"    \"No, madam, that cannot end. As she, Eve, the woman, was taken from  man's ribs, so she will remain unto the end of the world,\" said the old  man, shaking his head so triumphantly and so severely that the clerk,  deciding that the victory was on his side, burst into a loud laugh.    \"Yes, you men think so,\" replied the lady, without surrendering, and  turning toward us. \"You have given yourself liberty. As for woman, you  wish to keep her in the seraglio. To you, everything is permissible. Is  it not so?\"    \"Oh, man,--that's another affair.\"    \"Then, according to you, to man everything is permissible?\"    \"No one gives him this permission; only, if the man behaves badly  outside, the family is not increased thereby; but the woman, the wife,  is a fragile vessel,\" continued the merchant, severely.    His tone of authority evidently subjugated his hearers. Even the lady  felt crushed, but she did not surrender.    \"Yes, but you will admit, I think, that woman is a human being, and has  feelings like her husband. What should she do if she does not love her  husband?\"    \"If she does not love him!\" repeated the old man, stormily, and knitting  his brows; \"why, she will be made to love him.\"    This unexpected argument pleased the clerk, and he uttered a murmur of  approbation.    \"Oh, no, she will not be forced,\" said the lady. \"Where there is no  love, one cannot be obliged to love in spite of herself.\"    \"And if the wife deceives her husband, what is to be done?\" said the  lawyer.    \"That should not happen,\" said the old man. \"He must have his eyes about  him.\"    \"And if it does happen, all the same? You will admit that it does  happen?\"    \"It happens among the upper classes, not among us,\" answered the old  man. \"And if any husband is found who is such a fool as not to rule his  wife, he will not have robbed her. But no scandal, nevertheless. Love  or not, but do not disturb the household. Every husband can govern his  wife. He has the necessary power. It is only the imbecile who does not  succeed in doing so.\"    Everybody was silent. The clerk moved, advanced, and, not wishing to lag  behind the others in the conversation, began with his eternal smile:    \"Yes, in the house of our employer, a scandal has arisen, and it is very  difficult to view the matter clearly. The wife loved to amuse herself,  and began to go astray. He is a capable and serious man. First, it was  with the book-keeper. The husband tried to bring her back to reason  through kindness. She did not change her conduct. She plunged into all  sorts of beastliness. She began to steal his money. He beat her, but  she grew worse and worse. To an unbaptized, to a pagan, to a Jew (saving  your permission), she went in succession for her caresses. What could  the employer do? He has dropped her entirely, and now he lives as a  bachelor. As for her, she is dragging in the depths.\"    \"He is an imbecile,\" said the old man. \"If from the first he had not  allowed her to go in her own fashion, and had kept a firm hand upon her,  she would be living honestly, no danger. Liberty must be taken away from  the beginning. Do not trust yourself to your horse upon the highway. Do  not trust yourself to your wife at home.\"    At that moment the conductor passed, asking for the tickets for the next  station. The old man gave up his.    \"Yes, the feminine sex must be dominated in season, else all will  perish.\"    \"And you yourselves, at Kounavino, did you not lead a gay life with the  pretty girls?\" asked the lawyer with a smile.    \"Oh, that's another matter,\" said the merchant, severely. \"Good-by,\"  he added, rising. He wrapped himself in his cloak, lifted his cap, and,  taking his bag, left the car.    CHAPTER II.    Scarcely had the old man gone when a general conversation began.    \"There's a little Old Testament father for you,\" said the clerk.    \"He is a Domostroy,\"* said the lady. \"What savage ideas about a woman  and marriage!\"         *The Domostroy is a matrimonial code of the days of Ivan the       Terrible.    \"Yes, gentlemen,\" said the lawyer, \"we are still a long way from the  European ideas upon marriage. First, the rights of woman, then free  marriage, then divorce, as a question not yet solved.\" . . .    \"The main thing, and the thing which such people as he do not  understand,\" rejoined the lady, \"is that only love consecrates marriage,  and that the real marriage is that which is consecrated by love.\"    The clerk listened and smiled, with the air of one accustomed to store  in his memory all intelligent conversation that he hears, in order to  make use of it afterwards.    \"But what is this love that consecrates marriage?\" said, suddenly, the  voice of the nervous and taciturn gentleman, who, unnoticed by us, had  approached.    He was standing with his hand on the seat, and evidently agitated. His  face was red, a vein in his forehead was swollen, and the muscles of his  cheeks quivered.    \"What is this love that consecrates marriage?\" he repeated.    \"What love?\" said the lady. \"The ordinary love of husband and wife.\"    \"And how, then, can ordinary love consecrate marriage?\" continued the  nervous gentleman, still excited, and with a displeased air. He seemed  to wish to say something disagreeable to the lady. She felt it, and  began to grow agitated.    \"How? Why, very simply,\" said she.    The nervous gentleman seized the word as it left her lips.    \"No, not simply.\"    \"Madam says,\" interceded the lawyer indicating his companion, \"that  marriage should be first the result of an attachment, of a love, if  you will, and that, when love exists, and in that case only, marriage  represents something sacred. But every marriage which is not based on  a natural attachment, on love, has in it nothing that is morally  obligatory. Is not that the idea that you intended to convey?\" he asked  the lady.    The lady, with a nod of her head, expressed her approval of this  translation of her thoughts.    \"Then,\" resumed the lawyer, continuing his remarks.    But the nervous gentleman, evidently scarcely able to contain himself,  without allowing the lawyer to finish, asked:    \"Yes, sir. But what are we to understand by this love that alone  consecrates marriage?\"    \"Everybody knows what love is,\" said the lady.    \"But I don't know, and I should like to know how you define it.\"    \"How? It is very simple,\" said the lady.    And she seemed thoughtful, and then said:    \"Love . . . love . . . is a preference for one man or one woman to the  exclusion of all others. . . .\"    \"A preference for how long? . . . For a month, two days, or half an  hour?\" said the nervous gentleman, with special irritation.    \"No, permit me, you evidently are not talking of the same thing.\"    \"Yes, I am talking absolutely of the same thing. Of the preference  for one man or one woman to the exclusion of all others. But I ask: a  preference for how long?\"    \"For how long? For a long time, for a life-time sometimes.\"    \"But that happens only in novels. In life, never. In life this  preference for one to the exclusion of all others lasts in rare cases  several years, oftener several months, or even weeks, days,  hours. . . .\"    \"Oh, sir. Oh, no, no, permit me,\" said all three of us at the same time.    The clerk himself uttered a monosyllable of disapproval.    \"Yes, I know,\" he said, shouting louder than all of us; \"you are talking  of what is believed to exist, and I am talking of what is. Every man  feels what you call love toward each pretty woman he sees, and very  little toward his wife. That is the origin of the proverb,--and it is  a true one,--'Another's wife is a white swan, and ours is bitter  wormwood.\"'    \"Ah, but what you say is terrible! There certainly exists among human  beings this feeling which is called love, and which lasts, not for  months and years, but for life.\"    \"No, that does not exist. Even if it should be admitted that Menelaus  had preferred Helen all his life, Helen would have preferred Paris; and  so it has been, is, and will be eternally. And it cannot be otherwise,  just as it cannot happen that, in a load of chick-peas, two peas marked  with a special sign should fall side by side. Further, this is not only  an improbability, but it is certain that a feeling of satiety will come  to Helen or to Menelaus. The whole difference is that to one it comes  sooner, to the other later. It is only in stupid novels that it is  written that 'they loved each other all their lives.' And none but  children can believe it. To talk of loving a man or woman for life is  like saying that a candle can burn forever.\"    \"But you are talking of physical love. Do you not admit a love based  upon a conformity of ideals, on a spiritual affinity?\"    \"Why not? But in that case it is not necessary to procreate together  (excuse my brutality). The point is that this conformity of ideals is  not met among old people, but among young and pretty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#2)"],[1,"tolerance as  regards the apathy of the masses, and even as regards  the whole-hearted opposition of professed defenders  of the status quo. But the men whom he finds it  impossible to forgive are those who profess the same desire  for the amelioration of society as he feels himself,  but who do not accept his method of achieving this  end. The intense faith which enables him to withstand  persecution for the sake of his beliefs makes  him consider these beliefs so luminously obvious that  any thinking man who rejects them must be dishonest,  and must be actuated by some sinister motive  of treachery to the cause. Hence arises the spirit of  the sect, that bitter, narrow orthodoxy which is the  bane of those who hold strongly to an unpopular  creed. So many real temptations to treachery exist  that suspicion is natural. And among leaders,  ambition, which they mortify in their choice of a  career, is sure to return in a new form: in the desire  for intellectual mastery and for despotic power  within their own sect. From these causes it results  that the advocates of drastic reform divide  themselves into opposing schools, hating each other with  a bitter hatred, accusing each other often of such  crimes as being in the pay of the police, and demanding,  of any speaker or writer whom they are to  admire, that he shall conform exactly to their  prejudices, and make all his teaching minister to their  belief that the exact truth is to be found within the  limits of their creed. The result of this state of  mind is that, to a casual and unimaginative attention,  the men who have sacrificed most through the  wish to benefit mankind APPEAR to be actuated far  more by hatred than by love. And the demand for  orthodoxy is stifling to any free exercise of intellect.  This cause, as well as economic prejudice, has made  it difficult for the ``intellectuals'' to co-operate prac-  tically with the more extreme reformers, however they  may sympathize with their main purposes and even  with nine-tenths of their program.    Another reason why radical reformers are  misjudged by ordinary men is that they view existing  society from outside, with hostility towards its  institutions. Although, for the most part, they have  more belief than their neighbors in human nature's  inherent capacity for a good life, they are so  conscious of the cruelty and oppression resulting from  existing institutions that they make a wholly  misleading impression of cynicism. Most men have  instinctively two entirely different codes of behavior:  one toward those whom they regard as companions or  colleagues or friends, or in some way members of the  same ``herd''; the other toward those whom they  regard as enemies or outcasts or a danger to society.  Radical reformers are apt to concentrate their  attention upon the behavior of society toward the  latter class, the class of those toward whom the  ``herd'' feels ill-will. This class includes, of course,  enemies in war, and criminals; in the minds of those  who consider the preservation of the existing order  essential to their own safety or privileges, it includes  all who advocate any great political or economic  change, and all classes which, through their poverty  or through any other cause, are likely to feel a  dangerous degree of discontent. The ordinary citizen  probably seldom thinks about such individuals or  classes, and goes through life believing that he and  his friends are kindly people, because they have no  wish to injure those toward whom they entertain no  group-hostility. But the man whose attention is  fastened upon the relations of a group with those  whom it hates or fears will judge quite differently.  In these relations a surprising ferocity is apt to be  developed, and a very ugly side of human nature  comes to the fore. The opponents of capitalism  have learned, through the study of certain historical  facts, that this ferocity has often been shown by the  capitalists and by the State toward the wage-earning  classes, particularly when they have ventured to  protest against the unspeakable suffering to which  industrialism has usually condemned them. Hence  arises a quite different attitude toward existing  society from that of the ordinary well-to-do citizen:  an attitude as true as his, perhaps also as untrue,  but equally based on facts, facts concerning his  relations to his enemies instead of to his friends.    The class-war, like wars between nations,  produces two opposing views, each equally true and  equally untrue. The citizen of a nation at war,  when he thinks of his own countrymen, thinks of them  primarily as he has experienced them, in dealings  with their friends, in their family relations, and so  on. They seem to him on the whole kindly, decent  folk. But a nation with which his country is at  war views his compatriots through the medium of a  quite different set of experiences: as they appear  in the ferocity of battle, in the invasion and subjugation  of a hostile territory, or in the chicanery of a  juggling diplomacy. The men of whom these facts  are true are the very same as the men whom their  compatriots know as husbands or fathers or friends,  but they are judged differently because they are  judged on different data. And so it is with those who  view the capitalist from the standpoint of the  revolutionary wage-earner: they appear inconceivably  cynical and misjudging to the capitalist, because the  facts upon which their view is based are facts which  he either does not know or habitually ignores. Yet  the view from the outside is just as true as the view  from the inside. Both are necessary to the complete  truth; and the Socialist, who emphasizes the outside  view, is not a cynic, but merely the friend of the  wage-earners, maddened by the spectacle of the needless  misery which capitalism inflicts upon them.    I have placed these general reflections at the  beginning of our study, in order to make it clear to  the reader that, whatever bitterness and hate may  be found in the movements which we are to examine,  it is not bitterness or hate, but love, that is their  mainspring. It is difficult not to hate those who  torture the objects of our love. Though difficult, it  is not impossible; but it requires a breadth of  outlook and a comprehensiveness of understanding which  are not easy to preserve amid a desperate contest.  If ultimate wisdom has not always been preserved by  Socialists and Anarchists, they have not differed in  this from their opponents; and in the source of their  inspiration they have shown themselves superior to  those who acquiesce ignorantly or supinely in the  injustices and oppressions by which the existing  system is preserved.        PROPOSED ROADS  TO FREEDOM    SOCIALISM, ANARCHISM AND SYNDICALISM    PART I    HISTORICAL    CHAPTER I    MARX AND SOCIALIST DOCTRINE      SOCIALISM, like everything else that is vital, is  rather a tendency than a strictly definable body of  doctrine. A definition of Socialism is sure either to  include some views which many would regard as not  Socialistic, or to exclude others which claim to be  included. But I think we shall come nearest to the  essence of Socialism by defining it as the advocacy  of communal ownership of land and capital. Communal  ownership may mean ownership by a democratic  State, but cannot be held to include ownership  by any State which is not democratic. Communal  ownership may also be understood, as Anarchist  Communism understands it, in the sense of  ownership by the free association of the men and  women in a community without those compulsory  powers which are necessary to constitute a State.  Some Socialists expect communal ownership to arrive  suddenly and completely by a catastrophic revolution,  while others expect it to come gradually, first  in one industry, then in another. Some insist upon  the necessity of completeness in the acquisition of  land and capital by the public, while others would  be content to see lingering islands of private ownership,  provided they were not too extensive or powerful.  What all forms have in common is democracy  and the abolition, virtual or complete, of the present  capitalistic system. The distinction between Socialists,  Anarchists and Syndicalists turns largely upon  the kind of democracy which they desire. Orthodox  Socialists are content with parliamentary democracy  in the sphere of government, holding that the evils  apparent in this form of constitution at present  would disappear with the disappearance of capitalism.  Anarchists and Syndicalists, on the other  hand, object to the whole parliamentary machinery,  and aim at a different method of regulating the political  affairs of the community. But all alike are  democratic in the sense that they aim at abolishing  every kind of privilege and every kind of artificial  inequality: all alike are champions of the wage-  earner in existing society. All three also have much  in common in their economic doctrine. All three  regard capital and the wages system as a means of  exploiting the laborer in the interests of the possessing  classes, and hold that communal ownership, in one  form or another, is the only means of bringing freedom  to the producers. But within the framework  of this common doctrine there are many divergences,  and even among those who are strictly to be called  Socialists, there is a very considerable diversity of  schools.    Socialism as a power in Europe may be said  to begin with Marx. It is true that before his time  there were Socialist theories, both in England and in  France. It is also true that in France, during the  revolution of 1848, Socialism for a brief period  acquired considerable influence in the State. But  the Socialists who preceded Marx tended to indulge  in Utopian dreams and failed to found any strong or  stable political party. To Marx, in collaboration  with Engels, are due both the formulation of"]]]
