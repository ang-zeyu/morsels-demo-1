That if we now make one of the  two horizontal axes less and the other greater than the vertical axis,  the instantaneous pole will separate from the axis of the instrument,  and the axis will incline more and more till the spinning can no  longer go on, on account of the obliquity.

Address to the Mathematical and Physical Sections of the British  Association.    James Clerk Maxwell      [From the _British Association Report_, Vol. XL.]    [Liverpool, _September_ 15, 1870.]      At several of the recent Meetings of the British Association the  varied and important business of the Mathematical and Physical Section  has been introduced by an Address, the subject of which has been left  to the selection of the President for the time being.  The perplexing  duty of choosing a subject has not, however, fallen to me.    Professor Sylvester, the President of Section A at the Exeter Meeting,  gave us a noble vindication of pure mathematics by laying bare, as it  were, the very working of the mathematical mind, and setting before  us, not the array of symbols and brackets which form the armoury of  the mathematician, or the dry results which are only the monuments of  his conquests, but the mathematician himself, with all his human  faculties directed by his professional sagacity to the pursuit,  apprehension, and exhibition of that ideal harmony which he feels to  be the root of all knowledge, the fountain of all pleasure, and the  condition of all action.  The mathematician has, above all things, an  eye for symmetry; and Professor Sylvester has not only recognized the  symmetry formed by the combination of his own subject with those of  the former Presidents, but has pointed out the duties of his successor  in the following characteristic note:--    \"Mr Spottiswoode favoured the Section, in his opening Address, with a  combined history of the progress of Mathematics and Physics; Dr.  Tyndall's address was virtually on the limits of Physical Philosophy;  the one here in print,\" says Prof. Sylvester, \"is an attempted faint  adumbration of the nature of Mathematical Science in the abstract.  What is wanting (like a fourth sphere resting on three others in  contact) to build up the Ideal Pyramid is a discourse on the Relation  of the two branches (Mathematics and Physics) to, their action and  reaction upon, one another, a magnificent theme, with which it is to  be hoped that some future President of Section A will crown the  edifice and make the Tetralogy (symbolizable by _A+A'_, _A_, _A'_,  _AA'_) complete.\"    The theme thus distinctly laid down for his successor by our late  President is indeed a magnificent one, far too magnificent for any  efforts of mine to realize.  I have endeavoured to follow Mr  Spottiswoode, as with far-reaching vision he distinguishes the systems  of science into which phenomena, our knowledge of which is still in  the nebulous stage, are growing.  I have been carried by the  penetrating insight and forcible expression of Dr Tyndall into that  sanctuary of minuteness and of power where molecules obey the laws of  their existence, clash together in fierce collision, or grapple in yet  more fierce embrace, building up in secret the forms of visible  things.  I have been guided by Prof. Sylvester towards those serene  heights        \"Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,       Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,       Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,       Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar       Their sacred everlasting calm.\"    But who will lead me into that still more hidden and dimmer region  where Thought weds Fact, where the mental operation of the  mathematician and the physical action of the molecules are seen in  their true relation?  Does not the way to it pass through the very den  of the metaphysician, strewed with the remains of former explorers,  and abhorred by every man of science?  It would indeed be a foolhardy  adventure for me to take up the valuable time of the Section by  leading you into those speculations which require, as we know,  thousands of years even to shape themselves intelligibly.    But we are met as cultivators of mathematics and physics.  In our  daily work we are led up to questions the same in kind with those of  metaphysics; and we approach them, not trusting to the native  penetrating power of our own minds, but trained by a long-continued  adjustment of our modes of thought to the facts of external nature.    As mathematicians, we perform certain mental operations on the symbols  of number or of quantity, and, by proceeding step by step from more  simple to more complex operations, we are enabled to express the same  thing in many different forms.  The equivalence of these different  forms, though a necessary consequence of self-evident axioms, is not  always, to our minds, self-evident; but the mathematician, who by long  practice has acquired a familiarity with many of these forms, and has  become expert in the processes which lead from one to another, can  often transform a perplexing expression into another which explains  its meaning in more intelligible language.    As students of Physics we observe phenomena under varied  circumstances, and endeavour to deduce the laws of their relations.  Every natural phenomenon is, to our minds, the result of an infinitely  complex system of conditions.  What we set ourselves to do is to  unravel these conditions, and by viewing the phenomenon in a way which  is in itself partial and imperfect, to piece out its features one by  one, beginning with that which strikes us first, and thus gradually  learning how to look at the whole phenomenon so as to obtain a  continually greater degree of clearness and distinctness.  In this  process, the feature which presents itself most forcibly to the  untrained inquirer may not be that which is considered most  fundamental by the experienced man of science; for the success of any  physical investigation depends on the judicious selection of what is  to be observed as of primary importance, combined with a voluntary  abstraction of the mind from those features which, however attractive  they appear, we are not yet sufficiently advanced in science to  investigate with profit.    Intellectual processes of this kind have been going on since the first  formation of language, and are going on still.  No doubt the feature  which strikes us first and most forcibly in any phenomenon, is the  pleasure or the pain which accompanies it, and the agreeable or  disagreeable results which follow after it.  A theory of nature from  this point of view is embodied in many of our words and phrases, and  is by no means extinct even in our deliberate opinions.    It was a great step in science when men became convinced that, in  order to understand the nature of things, they must begin by asking,  not whether a thing is good or bad, noxious or beneficial, but of what  kind is it? and how much is there of it?  Quality and Quantity were  then first recognized as the primary features to be observed in  scientific inquiry.    As science has been developed, the domain of quantity has everywhere  encroached on that of quality, till the process of scientific inquiry  seems to have become simply the measurement and registration of  quantities, combined with a mathematical discussion of the numbers  thus obtained.  It is this scientific method of directing our  attention to those features of phenomena which may be regarded as  quantities which brings physical research under the influence of  mathematical reasoning.  In the work of the Section we shall have  abundant examples of the successful application of this method to the  most recent conquests of science; but I wish at present to direct your  attention to some of the reciprocal effects of the progress of science  on those elementary conceptions which are sometimes thought to be  beyond the reach of change.    If the skill of the mathematician has enabled the experimentalist to  see that the quantities which he has measured are connected by  necessary relations, the discoveries of physics have revealed to the  mathematician new forms of quantities which he could never have  imagined for himself.    Of the methods by which the mathematician may make his labours most  useful to the student of nature, that which I think is at present most  important is the systematic classification of quantities.    The quantities which we study in mathematics and physics may be  classified in two different ways.    The student who wishes to master any particular science must make  himself familiar with the various kinds of quantities which belong to  that science.  When he understands all the relations between these  quantities, he regards them as forming a connected system, and he  classes the whole system of quantities together as belonging to that  particular science.  This classification is the most natural from a  physical point of view, and it is generally the first in order of  time.    But when the student has become acquainted with several different  sciences, he finds that the mathematical processes and trains of  reasoning in one science resemble those in another so much that his  knowledge of the one science may be made a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#2)"],[1," fort. The duty of a  sentinel over the British colors, which had just been hoisted was  assigned to me, and I certainly felt not a little proud of the  distinction.    Five times within half a century had the flag of that fortress been  changed. First the lily of France, then the red cross of England, and  next the stars and stripes of America had floated over its ramparts;  and then again the red cross, and lastly the stars. On my return to  this country a few years since, I visited those scenes of stirring  excitement in which my boyhood had been passed, but I looked in vain  for the ancient fortifications which had given a classical interest to  that region. The unsparing hand of utilitarianism had passed over them,  destroying almost every vestige of the past. Where had risen the only  fortress in America at all worthy to give antiquity to the scene,  streets had been laid out and made, and houses had been built, leaving  not a trace of its existence save the well that formerly supplied the  closely besieged garrison with water; and this, half imbedded in the  herbage of an enclosure of a dwelling house of mean appearance, was  rather to be guessed at than seen; while at the opposite extremity of  the city, where had been conspicuous for years the Bloody Run,  cultivation and improvement had nearly obliterated every trace of the  past.    Two objections have been urged against \"Wacousta\" as a consistent  tale--the one as involving an improbability, the other a geographical  error. It has been assumed that the startling feat accomplished by that  man of deep revenge, who is not alone in his bitter hatred and contempt  for the base among those who, like spaniels, crawl and kiss the dust at  the instigation of their superiors, and yet arrogate to themselves a  claim to be considered gentlemen and men of honor and independence--it  has, I repeat, been assumed that the feat attributed to him in  connection with the flag-staff of the fort was impossible. No one who  has ever seen these erections on the small forts of that day would  pronounce the same criticism. Never very lofty, they were ascended at  least one-third of their height by means of small projections nailed to  them for footholds for the artillerymen, frequently compelled to clear  the flag lines entangled at the truck; therefore a strong and active  man, such as Wacousta is described to have been, might very well have  been supposed, in his strong anxiety for revenge and escape with his  victim, to have doubled his strength and activity on so important an  occasion, rendering that easy of attainment by himself which an  ordinary and unexcited man might deem impossible. I myself have knocked  down a gate, almost without feeling the resistance, in order to escape  the stilettos of assassins.    The second objection is to the narrowness attributed in the tale to the  river St. Clair. This was done in the license usually accorded to a  writer of fiction, in order to give greater effect to the scene  represented as having occurred there, and, of course, in no way  intended as a geographical description of the river, nor was it  necessary. In the same spirit and for the same purpose it has been  continued.    It will be seen that at the termination of the tragedy enacted at the  bridge, by which the Bloody Run was in those days crossed, that the  wretched wife of the condemned soldier pronounced a curse that could  not, of course, well be fulfilled in the course of the tale. Some few  years ago I published in Canada--I might as well have done so in  Kamschatka--the continuation, which was to have been dedicated to the  last King of England, but which, after the death of that monarch, was  inscribed to Sir John Harvey, whose letter, as making honorable mention  of a gallant and beloved brother, I feel it a duty to the memory of the  latter to subjoin.

November 26th, 1839.       \"Dear Sir;--I am favored with your very interesting     communication of the 2nd instant, by which I learn     that you are the brother of two youths whose gallantry     and merits--and with regard to one of them, his     sufferings--during the late war, excited my warmest     admiration and sympathy. I beg you to believe that I     am far from insensible to the affecting proofs which     you have made known to me of this grateful recollection     of any little service I may have had it in my power     to render them; and I will add that the desire which     I felt to serve the father will be found to extend     itself to the son, if your nephew should ever find     himself under circumstances to require from me any     service which it may be within my power to render him.\"       \"With regard to your very flattering proposition to     inscribe your present work to me, I can only say that,     independent of the respect to which the author of so     very charming a production as 'Wacousta' is entitled,     the interesting facts and circumstances so unexpectedly     brought to my knowledge and recollection would ensure     a ready acquiescence on my part.\"       \"I remain, dear sir your very faithful servant\"       \"(Signed)   J.

While connecting it with the \"Prophecy Fulfilled,\" and  making it subservient to the end I had in view, I had not read or even  heard of the existence of a work of the same character, which had  already appeared from the pen of an American author. Indeed, I have  reason to believe that the \"Prophecy Fulfilled,\" although not published  until after a lapse of years, was the first written. No similarity of  treatment of the subject exists between the two versions, and this, be  it remembered, I remark without in the slightest degree impugning the  merit of the production of my fellow-laborer in the same field.    THE AUTHOR.    New York City, January 1st, 1851.          CHAPTER I    INTRODUCTORY    As we are about to introduce our readers to scenes with which the  European is little familiarised, some few cursory remarks, illustrative  of the general features of the country into which we have shifted our  labours, may not be deemed misplaced at the opening of this volume.    Without entering into minute geographical detail, it may be necessary  merely to point out the outline of such portions of the vast continent  of America as still acknowledge allegiance to the English crown, in  order that the reader, understanding the localities, may enter with  deeper interest into the incidents of a tale connected with a ground  hitherto untouched by the wand of the modern novelist.    All who have ever taken the trouble to inform themselves of the  features of a country so little interesting to the majority of  Englishmen in their individual character must be aware,--and for the  information of those who are not, we state,--that that portion of the  northern continent of America which is known as the United States is  divided from the Canadas by a continuous chain of lakes and rivers,  commencing at the ocean into which they empty themselves, and extending  in a north-western direction to the remotest parts of these wild  regions, which have never yet been pressed by other footsteps than  those of the native hunters of the soil. First we have the magnificent  St. Lawrence, fed from the lesser and tributary streams, rolling her  sweet and silver waters into the foggy seas of the Newfoundland.--But  perhaps it will better tend to impress our readers with a panoramic  picture of the country in which our scene of action is more immediately  laid, by commencing at those extreme and remote points of our Canadian  possessions to which their attention will be especially directed in the  course of our narrative.    The most distant of the north-western settlements of America is  Michilimackinac, a name given by the Indians, and preserved by the  Americans, who possess the fort even to this hour. It is situated at  the head of the Lakes Michigan and Huron, and adjacent to the Island of  St. Joseph's, where, since the existence of the United States as an  independent republic, an English garrison has been maintained, with a  view of keeping the original fortress in check. From the lakes above  mentioned we descend into the River Sinclair, which, in turn,  disembogues itself into the lake of the same name. This again renders  tribute to the Detroit, a broad majestic river, not less than a mile in  breadth at its source, and progressively widening towards its mouth  until it is finally lost in the beautiful Lake Erie, computed at about  one hundred and sixty miles in circumference. From the embouchure of  this latter lake commences the Chippawa, better known in Europe from  the celebrity of its stupendous falls of Niagara, which form an  impassable barrier to the seaman, and, for a short space, sever the  otherwise uninterrupted chain connecting the remote fortresses we have  described with the Atlantic. At a distance of a few miles from the  falls, the Chippawa finally empties itself into the Ontario, the most  splendid of the gorgeous American lakes, on the bright bosom of which,  during the late war, frigates, seventy-fours, and even a ship of one  hundred and twelve guns, manned by a crew of one thousand men,  reflected the proud pennants of England! At the opposite extremity of  this magnificent and sea-like lake, which is upwards of two hundred  miles in circumference, the far-famed St. Lawrence takes her source;  and after passing through a vast tract of country, whose elevated banks  bear every trace of fertility and"]]]
