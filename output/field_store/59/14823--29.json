Economy does not mean niggardliness, or a determination to get  along without tools that your neighbor has purchased. A neglect to  secure the best tool needed might be classed as an extravagance, a  waste, if the tool in question could have added to the quality and  quantity of the output, without the expenditure of more labor.    Business common-sense is taking the place of old-fashioned  conservatism and scientific methods are no longer sneered at as  \"book-farming.\"          CHAPTER II    DOCUMENTS EVERY FARMER SHOULD UNDERSTAND        All property implies an owner. Property is of two kinds, real and  personal. The former is permanent and fixed, the latter can be  moved.    Every occupant of realty holds it through a deed, which carries  with it sole ownership, or through a lease which carries with it  the right to occupation and use in accordance with the conditions  as to time and the amount to be paid, set forth in the written  instrument.    A deed carries with it sole ownership, a lease covers the right of  use for a fixed period.    AS TO DEEDS    The purchaser of real estate, say a farm, should receive, from the  person selling the property, a written instrument, or conveyance  known as a deed.    The deed must show clearly that the title to or interest in the  property has been transferred from the seller to the buyer.    Before the deed is signed and delivered, the buyer should know  that he is getting a clear title to the property described in the  conveyance.    In order to insure the accuracy of the title and thus avoid  subsequent complications and perhaps lawsuits, the paper should be  submitted to some good lawyer, or other person acquainted with  real estate law and the methods by which titles are traced from  the first owner to the present possessor.    TITLE ABSTRACTS    In all the great business centers of the United States there are  Title Guarantee Companies, who for a consideration--to be paid by  the seller--furnish an abstract of title, and insure its validity.    In smaller places the local lawyers know how to make up an  abstract and one should be employed. Never trust the search of the  inexperienced.    An abstract of title is a memorandum taken from the records of the  office where deeds are recorded, and showing the history of the  title from the Government up to the present time.    The seller should furnish the buyer with a certificate from the  proper county officer, showing whether or not all taxes have been  paid up to the last assessment.    In addition to this, before the money is paid and the deed  accepted, the purchaser should be satisfied that there are no  mortgages, liens, attachments or other claims against the  property.    If such claims exist and are known to the buyer, he may assume  them as a condition of the sale.    PARTIES TO A DEED    The person selling the land and making the deed is known in law as  the Grantor. The person buying the property is known as the  Grantee.    A deed is a form of contract, and in order to have its terms and  statements binding on the maker, he must be twenty-one years of  age, or over, and he must be of sound mind.    The grantee need not be twenty-one, nor of sound mind in order to  make the terms of the deed binding on the grantor.    In some states, if the grantor be a married man, his wife must  sign the deed with him. This should be seen to, for without the  wife's signature the grantee will not have a clear title, for the  woman could still claim an interest in the property equal to her  dower right.    Also, if the grantor is a woman, her husband, for the reasons  given, should join with her in the execution of the deed.    The preparation of a deed should not be left to the unskilled.    DIFFERENT DEEDS    There are three kinds of deeds, viz.: General warranty deeds,  special warranty deeds, and quit-claim deeds.    The general warranty deed, if it can be had, is the one every  purchaser should get.    In the general warranty deed the grantor agrees for himself, \"his  heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns,\" that at the time  of making the deed he is lawfully in possession, \"seized\" is the  legal term, of the estate described in the deed, that it is free  from all incumbrance, and that he will warrant and defend the  grantee and his heirs and assigns against all claims whatsoever.    In the quit-claim deed the grantor conveys to the purchaser his  interest in or right to the property under consideration.    The quit-claim grantor does not guarantee the title to the  property, nor warrant the grantee against any other claims. He  simply, by the deed, quits his claim to the property.    The special warranty deed covenants and warrants only against the  acts of the grantor and those claiming title under him.    MAKING A DEED    After a deed is properly drawn, it is ready to be signed, sealed,  and delivered to the grantee.    If the wife of the grantor is to sign, her name should follow that  of her husband.    If one or both cannot write, the signature can be made in this  way:                His        George X Jones.             Mark.    Witness..............      In some states one or more witnesses are required to the signature  of the grantor; in others, witnesses are not necessary, except  where a \"mark\" is made.    An important part of a deed is the Acknowledgment. This is the act  of acknowledging before a notary public, justice or other official  properly qualified to administer an oath, that the signatures are  genuine and made voluntarily.    The acknowledgment having been taken, the official stamps the  paper with his seal and signs it.    In some states the law requires that a wax or paper seal be  attached to the paper, while in others a circular scroll, made  with the pen, with the letters \"L.S.\" in the center answer the  purpose.    When the foregoing essentials are complied with the deed must be  delivered to the grantee. The delivery is essential, for without  it the deed is of no value, even though every other requisite be  complied with.    A deed may be made for land on which full payment has already been  acknowledged, but if the grantor dies before the deed is  delivered, then the deed has no legal value.    A deed obtained by fraud, deceit or compulsion is void.    RECORDING DEEDS    As soon as possible after the grantee has received the deed, he  should have it recorded.    In every county in the different states there is an officer, known  as register or recorder, whose duty it is to enter in regular  folios, or books, a copy of every deed or mortgage presented to  him. The document then becomes a part of the county records.    The grantee must pay the recording fees.    Anyone, on paying the fee for copying and certifying, can obtain a  copy of any document that has been recorded in a register's  office.    If an original deed is lost, the certified copy of the register  has all the legality of the original.    All deeds and other papers of value should be carefully kept, so  that they may be available, if needed.    A small safe deposit box with a company that keeps such spaces for  rent, is often a wise investment.    Keep all related papers in one package or envelope.    If there is one lawyer who attends to all your legal business, he  will be a good custodian of all papers of record, for he usually  has a fireproof safe.          CHAPTER III    OTHER FORMS OF DEEDS--MORTGAGES        There is one condition under which the grantor does not turn over  or deliver the deed to the grantee after it is made. This is known  as a Deed in Escrow.    A deed \"delivered in escrow\" is when the document is placed with a  third party to be by him delivered to the grantee when a certain  time has elapsed or certain conditions have been fulfilled.    When the conditions have been complied with, the deed is given by  its custodian to the grantee, which is as legal as if it were  given by the grantor in person.    TRUST DEEDS    A trust deed is the form used to convey property to some person  who is entitled to its proceeds or profits.    This form of deed is often used to secure the payment of a debt.  In some states they take the place of mortgages.    Where the trust deed is meant to take the place of a mortgage to  secure a debt payment, the property is deeded to a third party  known as a \"trustee.\"    The trustee in this case is the agent for debtor and creditor, and  he must act impartially.    The trust deed specifies the character of the debt to be secured.  In case of failure to pay the debt as agreed on, the trustee may,  if so warranted, sell the property, and pay the obligation from  the proceeds.    The grantor in a trust deed, if not stipulated to the contrary, is  entitled to all the rents and profits of the property; for it  remains virtually his, until he has failed to fill his contract.    When the indebtedness secured by the trust deed has been paid, the  trustee must at once execute a paper known to law as a Release  Deed. When recorded this instrument discharges the lien.    AS TO MORTGAGES    Mortgages are of two kinds, real and chattel. The first is a lien  on real estate, the second on personal property.    A mortgage may be defined as a conveyance of property, personal or  real, as security for the payment of a debt, or it may be given as  a guarantee for the performance of some particular duty.    MORTGAGE FORMS    When a mortgage is given as security for the payment of a debt,  the rule is to give a note for the payment of the amount involved.  The mortgage becomes in this case the security for the note's  payment.    In the body of the note it must be stated that it is secured by  mortgage.    The date of the note and mortgage should be the same.    The man who mortgages his property is the mortgagor.    The man to whom the mortgage is given is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#2)"],[1,"eart,        Though small the hope to win it.            I'll tell a tale how Farmer John        A little roan colt bred, sir,        Which every night and every morn        He watered and he fed, sir.          Said Neighbor Joe to Farmer John,        \"You surely are a dolt, sir,        To spend such time and care upon        A little useless colt, sir.\"          Said Farmer John to Neighbor Joe,        \"I bring my little roan up        Not for the good he now can do,        But will do when he's grown up.\"          The moral you can plainly see,        To keep the tale from spoiling,        The little colt you think is me--        I know it by your smiling.          And now, my friends, please to excuse        My lisping and my stammers;        I, for this once, have done my best,        And so--I'll make my manners.    The little boy's name was Edward Everett. He grew up to become a famous  man and one of our greatest orators.          WRITING A COMPOSITION        \"Children, to-morrow I shall expect all of you to write compositions,\"  said the teacher of Love Lane School. \"Then, on Friday those who have  done the best may stand up and read their compositions to the school.\"    Some of the children were pleased, and some were not.    \"What shall we write about?\" they asked.    \"You may choose any subject that you like best,\" said the teacher.    Some of them thought that \"Home\" was a good subject. Others liked  \"School.\" One little boy chose \"The Horse.\" A little girl said she  would write about \"Summer.\"    The next day, every pupil except one had written a composition.    \"Henry Longfellow,\" said the teacher, \"why have you not written?\"    \"Because I don't know how,\" answered Henry. He was only a child.    \"Well,\" said the teacher, \"you can write words, can you not?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the boy.    \"After you have written three or four words, you can put them together,  can you not?\"    \"Yes, sir; I think so.\"    \"Well, then,\" said the teacher, \"you may take your slate and go out  behind the schoolhouse for half an hour. Think of something to write  about, and write the word on your slate. Then try to tell what it is,  what it is like, what it is good for, and what is done with it. That  is the way to write a composition.\"    Henry took his slate and went out. Just behind the schoolhouse was Mr.  Finney's barn. Quite close to the barn was a garden. And in the garden,  Henry saw a turnip.    \"Well, I know what that is,\" he said to himself; and he wrote the word  _turnip_ on his slate. Then he tried to tell what it was like, what it  was good for, and what was done with it.    Before the half hour was ended he had written a very neat composition  on his slate. He then went into the house, and waited while the teacher  read it.    The teacher was surprised and pleased. He said, \"Henry Longfellow, you  have done very well. Today you may stand up before the school and read  what you have written about the turnip.\"    Many years after that, some funny little verses about Mr. Finney's  turnip were printed in a newspaper. Some people said that they were  what Henry Longfellow wrote on his slate that day at school.    But this was not true. Henry's composition was not in verse. As soon  as it was read to the school, he rubbed it off the slate, and it was  forgotten. Perhaps you would like to read those funny verses. Here  they are; but you must never, _never_, NEVER think that Henry  Longfellow wrote them.          Mr. Finney had a turnip,        And it grew, and it grew;        It grew behind the barn,        And the turnip did no harm.          And it grew, and it grew,        Till it could grow no taller;        Then Mr. Finney took it up,        And put it in the cellar.          There it lay, there it lay,        Till it began to rot;        Then Susie Finney washed it        And put it in a pot.          She boiled it, and boiled it,        As long as she was able;        Then Mrs. Finney took it,        And put it on the table.          Mr. Finney and his wife        Both sat down to sup;        And they ate, and they ate,        They ate the turnip up.      All the school children in our country have heard of Henry W.  Longfellow. He was the best loved of all our poets. He wrote \"The  Village Blacksmith,\" \"The Children's Hour,\" and many other beautiful  pieces which you will like to read and remember.          THE WHISTLE        Two hundred years ago there lived in Boston a little boy whose name  was Benjamin Franklin.    On the day that he was seven years old, his mother gave him a few  pennies.    He looked at the bright, yellow pieces and said, \"What shall I do with  these coppers, mother?\"    It was the first money that he had ever had.    \"You may buy something, if you wish,\" said his mother.    \"And then will you give me more?\" he asked.    His mother shook her head and said: \"No, Benjamin. I cannot give you  any more. So you must be careful not to spend these foolishly.\"    The little fellow ran into the street. He heard the pennies jingle in  his pocket. How rich he was!    Boston is now a great city, but at that time it was only a little town.  There were not many stores.    As Benjamin ran down the street, he wondered what he should buy. Should  he buy candy? He hardly knew how it tasted. Should he buy a pretty  toy? If he had been the only child in the family, things might have  been different. But there were fourteen boys and girls older than he,  and two little sisters who were younger.    What a big family it was! And the father was a poor man. No wonder the  lad had never owned a toy.    He had not gone far when he met a larger boy, who was blowing a  whistle.    \"I wish I had that whistle,\" he said.    The big boy looked at him and blew it again. Oh, what a pretty sound  it made!    \"I have some pennies,\" said Benjamin. He held them in his hand, and  showed them to the boy. \"You may have them, if you will give me the  whistle.\" \"All of them?\"    \"Yes, all of them.\"    \"Well, it's a bargain,\" said the boy; and he gave the whistle to  Benjamin, and took the pennies.    Little Benjamin Franklin was very happy; for he was only seven years  old. He ran home as fast as he could, blowing the whistle as he ran.    \"See, mother,\" he said, \"I have bought a whistle.\"    \"How much did you pay for it?\"    \"All the pennies you gave me.\"    \"Oh, Benjamin!\"    One of his brothers asked to see the whistle.    \"Well, well!\" he said. \"You've paid a dear price for this thing. It's  only a penny whistle, and a poor one at that.\"    \"You might have bought half a dozen such whistles with the money I  gave you,\" said his mother.    The little boy saw what a mistake he had made. The whistle did not  please him any more. He threw it upon the floor and began to cry.    \"Never mind, my child,\" said his mother, very kindly. \"You are only  a very little boy, and you will learn a great deal as you grow bigger.  The lesson you have learned to-day is never to pay too dear for a  whistle.\" Benjamin Franklin lived to be a very old man, but he never  forgot that lesson.    Every boy and girl should remember the name of Benjamin Franklin. He  was a great thinker and a great doer, and with Washington he helped  to make our country free. His life was such that no man could ever  say, \"Ben Franklin has wronged me.\"          THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD    I        In Scotland there once lived a poor shepherd whose name was James Hogg.  His father and grandfather and great-grandfather had all been  shepherds.    It was his business to take care of the sheep which belonged to a rich  landholder by the Ettrick Water. Sometimes he had several hundreds of  lambs to look after. He drove these to the pastures on the hills and  watched them day after day while they fed on the short green grass.    He had a dog which he called Sirrah. This dog helped him watch the  sheep. He would drive them from place to place as his master wished.  Sometimes he would take care of the whole flock while the shepherd was  resting or eating his dinner.    One dark night James Hogg was on the hilltop with a flock of seven  hundred lambs. Sirrah was with him. Suddenly a storm came up. There  was thunder and lightning; the wind blew hard; the rain poured.    The poor lambs were frightened. The shepherd and his dog could not  keep them together. Some of them ran towards the east, some towards  the west, and some towards the south.    The shepherd soon lost sight of them in the darkness. With his lighted  lantern in his hand, he went up and down the rough hills calling for  his lambs.    Two or three other shepherds joined him in the search. All night long  they sought for the lambs.    Morning came and still they sought. They looked, as they thought, in  every place where the lambs might have taken shelter.    At last James Hogg said, \"It's of no use; all we can do is to go home  and tell the master that we have lost his whole flock.\"    They had walked a mile or two towards home, when they came to the edge  of a narrow and deep ravine. They looked down, and at the bottom they  saw some lambs huddled together among the rocks. And there was Sirrah  standing guard over them and looking all around for help \"These must  be the lambs that rushed off towards the south,\" said James Hogg.    [Illustration]    The men hurried down and soon saw that the flock was a large one.    \"I really believe they are all here,\" said one.    They counted them and were surprised to find that not one lamb of the  great flock of seven hundred was missing.    How had Sirrah managed to get the three scattered divisions together?  How had he managed to drive all the frightened little animals into  this place of safety?    Nobody could answer these questions. But there was no shepherd in  Scotland that could have done better than Sirrah did that night.    Long afterward James Hogg said, \"I never felt so grateful to any  creature below the sun as I did to Sirrah that morning.\"        II      When"]]]
