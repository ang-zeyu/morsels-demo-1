In another instant Necile had caught it to her  breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.        3.  The Adoption    The Master Woodsman suddenly rose, with knitted brows.  \"There is a  strange presence in the Forest,\" he declared.  Then the Queen and her  nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping  infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue  eyes.    And thus for a moment they remained, the nymphs filled with surprise  and consternation, but the brow of the Master Woodsman gradually  clearing as he gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had  wilfully broken the Law.  Then the great Ak, to the wonder of all, laid  his hand softly on Necile's flowing locks and kissed her on her fair  forehead.    \"For the first time within my knowledge,\" said he, gently, \"a nymph has  defied me and my laws; yet in my heart can I find no word of chiding.  What is your desire, Necile?\"    \"Let me keep the child!\" she answered, beginning to tremble and falling  on her knees in supplication.    \"Here, in the Forest of Burzee, where the human race has never yet  penetrated?\" questioned Ak.    \"Here, in the Forest of Burzee,\" replied the nymph, boldly.  \"It is my  home, and I am weary for lack of occupation.  Let me care for the babe!  See how weak and helpless it is.  Surely it can not harm Burzee nor the  Master Woodsman of the World!\"    \"But the Law, child, the Law!\" cried Ak, sternly.    \"The Law is made by the Master Woodsman,\" returned Necile; \"if he bids  me care for the babe he himself has saved from death, who in all the  world dare oppose me?\"  Queen Zurline, who had listened intently to  this conversation, clapped her pretty hands gleefully at the nymph's  answer.    \"You are fairly trapped, O Ak!\" she exclaimed, laughing.  \"Now, I pray  you, give heed to Necile's petition.\"    The Woodsman, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled  beard slowly.  Then he said:    \"She shall keep the babe, and I will give it my protection.  But I warn  you all that as this is the first time I have relaxed the Law, so shall  it be the last time.  Never more, to the end of the World, shall a  mortal be adopted by an immortal.  Otherwise would we abandon our happy  existence for one of trouble and anxiety.  Good night, my nymphs!\"    Then Ak was gone from their midst, and Necile hurried away to her bower  to rejoice over her new-found treasure.        4.  Claus    Another day found Necile's bower the most popular place in the Forest.  The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her  lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight.  Nor were they wanting  in praises for the great Ak's kindness in allowing Necile to keep the  babe and to care for it.  Even the Queen came to peer into the innocent  childish face and to hold a helpless, chubby fist in her own fair hand.    \"What shall we call him, Necile?\" she asked, smiling.  \"He must have a  name, you know.\"    \"Let him be called Claus,\" answered Necile, \"for that means 'a little  one.'\"    \"Rather let him be called Neclaus,\"** returned the Queen, \"for that  will mean 'Necile's little one.'\"    The nymphs clapped their hands in delight, and Neclaus became the  infant's name, although Necile loved best to call him Claus, and in  afterdays many of her sisters followed her example.    Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie  upon, and she made his bed in her own bower.  Of food the infant had no  lack.  The nymphs searched the forest for bell-udders, which grow upon  the goa-tree and when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk.  And the soft-eyed does willingly gave a share of their milk to support  the little stranger, while Shiegra, the lioness, often crept stealthily  into Necile's bower and purred softly as she lay beside the babe and  fed it.    So the little one flourished and grew big and sturdy day by day, while  Necile taught him to speak and to walk and to play.    His thoughts and words were sweet and gentle, for the nymphs knew no  evil and their hearts were pure and loving.  He became the pet of the  forest, for Ak's decree had forbidden beast or reptile to molest him,  and he walked fearlessly wherever his will guided him.    Presently the news reached the other immortals that the nymphs of  Burzee had adopted a human infant, and that the act had been sanctioned  by the great Ak.  Therefore many of them came to visit the little  stranger, looking upon him with much interest.  First the Ryls, who are  first cousins to the wood-nymphs, although so differently formed.  For  the Ryls are required to watch over the flowers and plants, as the  nymphs watch over the forest trees.  They search the wide world for the  food required by the roots of the flowering plants, while the brilliant  colors possessed by the full-blown flowers are due to the dyes placed  in the soil by the Ryls, which are drawn through the little veins in  the roots and the body of the plants, as they reach maturity.  The Ryls  are a busy people, for their flowers bloom and fade continually, but  they are merry and light-hearted and are very popular with the other  immortals.    Next came the Knooks, whose duty it is to watch over the beasts of the  world, both gentle and wild.  The Knooks have a hard time of it, since  many of the beasts are ungovernable and rebel against restraint.  But  they know how to manage them, after all, and you will find that certain  laws of the Knooks are obeyed by even the most ferocious animals.  Their anxieties make the Knooks look old and worn and crooked, and  their natures are a bit rough from associating with wild creatures  continually; yet they are most useful to humanity and to the world in  general, as their laws are the only laws the forest beasts recognize  except those of the Master Woodsman.    Then there were the Fairies, the guardians of mankind, who were much  interested in the adoption of Claus because their own laws forbade them  to become familiar with their human charges.  There are instances on  record where the Fairies have shown themselves to human beings, and  have even conversed with them; but they are supposed to guard the lives  of mankind unseen and unknown, and if they favor some people more than  others it is because these have won such distinction fairly, as the  Fairies are very just and impartial.  But the idea of adopting a child  of men had never occurred to them because it was in every way opposed  to their laws;  so their curiosity was intense to behold the little  stranger adopted by Necile and her sister nymphs.    Claus looked upon the immortals who thronged around him with fearless  eyes and smiling lips.  He rode laughingly upon the shoulders of the  merry Ryls; he mischievously pulled the gray beards of the low-browed  Knooks;  he rested his curly head confidently upon the dainty bosom of  the Fairy Queen herself.  And the Ryls loved the sound of his laughter;  the Knooks loved his courage; the Fairies loved his innocence.    The boy made friends of them all, and learned to know their laws  intimately.  No forest flower was trampled beneath his feet, lest the  friendly Ryls should be grieved.  He never interfered with the beasts  of the forest, lest his friends the Knooks should become angry.  The  Fairies he loved dearly, but, knowing nothing of mankind, he could not  understand that he was the only one of his race admitted to friendly  intercourse with them.    Indeed, Claus came to consider that he alone, of all the forest people,  had no like nor fellow.  To him the forest was the world.  He had no  idea that millions of toiling, striving human creatures existed.    And he was happy and content.      ** Some people have spelled this name Nicklaus and others Nicolas,     which is the reason that Santa Claus is still known in some lands     as St. Nicolas.  But, of course, Neclaus is his right name, and     Claus the nickname given him by his adopted mother, the fair nymph     Necile.        5.  The Master Woodsman    Years pass swiftly in Burzee, for the nymphs have no need to regard  time in any way.  Even centuries make no change in the dainty  creatures; ever and ever they remain the same, immortal and unchanging.    Claus, however, being mortal, grew to manhood day by day.  Necile was  disturbed, presently, to find him too big to lie in her lap, and he had  a desire for other food than milk.  His stout legs carried him far into  Burzee's heart, where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries, as well  as several sweet and wholesome roots, which suited his stomach better  than the belludders.  He sought Necile's bower less frequently, till  finally it became his custom to return thither only to sleep.    The nymph, who had come to love him dearly, was puzzled to comprehend  the changed nature of her charge, and unconsciously altered her own  mode of life to conform to his whims.  She followed him readily through  the forest paths, as did many of her sister nymphs, explaining as they  walked all the mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature  of the living things which dwelt beneath its shade.    The language of the beasts became clear to little Claus; but he never  could understand their sulky and morose tempers.  Only the squirrels,  the mice and the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures;  yet would the boy laugh when the panther growled, and stroke the bear's  glossy coat while the creature snarled and bared its teeth menacingly.  The growls and snarls were not for Claus, he well knew, so what did  they matter?    He could sing the songs of the bees, recite the poetry of the  wood-flowers and relate the history of every blinking owl in Burzee.  He helped the Ryls to feed their plants and the Knooks to keep order  among the animals.
