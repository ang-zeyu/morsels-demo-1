[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#2)"],[1,"at's true, you know, you'd better  believe it,\" said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he  did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably  meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood.  K.  found himself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but  then slapped his hand down on his papers and said, \"Here are my identity  documents.\"  \"And what do you want us to do about it?\" replied the big  policeman, loudly.  \"The way you're carrying on, it's worse than a  child. What is it you want?  Do you want to get this great, bloody trial  of yours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with  us?  We're just coppers, that's all we are.  Junior officers like us  hardly know one end of an ID card from another, all we've got to do with  you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it.  That's all we are.  Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high  officials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're  going to arrest, and why he should be arrested, before they issue the  warrant.  There's no mistake there.   Our authorities as far as I know,  and I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for guilt among  the public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law,  and they have to send us police officers out.  That's the law. Where  d'you think there'd be any mistake there?\"  \"I don't know this law,\"  said K.  \"So much the worse for you, then,\" said the policeman.  \"It's  probably exists only in your heads,\" said K., he wanted, in some way, to  insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those  thoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there.  But the  policeman just said dismissively, \"You'll find out when it affects you.\"  Franz joined in, and said, \"Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't  know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent.\"  \"You're quite  right, but we can't get him to understand a thing,\" said the other.  K.  stopped talking with them; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have  to carry on getting tangled up with the chattering of base functionaries  like this? - and they admit themselves that they are of the lowest  position.  They're talking about things of which they don't have the  slightest understanding, anyway.  It's only because of their stupidity  that they're able to be so sure of themselves.  I just need  few words  with someone of the same social standing as myself and everything will  be incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long conversation with  these two can make it.  He walked up and down the free space in the room  a couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who,  now, had pulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window  and had her arms around him.  K. had to put an end to this display,  \"Take me to your superior,\" he said.  \"As soon as he wants to see you.  Not before,\" said the policeman, the one called Willem.  \"And now my  advice to you,\" he added, \"is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait  and see what's to be done with you.  If you take our advice, you won't  tire yourself out thinking about things to no purpose, you need to pull  yourself together as there's a lot that's going to required of you.  You've not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so good to  you, you forget that we, whatever we are, we're still free men and  you're not, and that's quite an advantage.  But in spite of all that  we're still willing, if you've got the money, to go and get you some  breakfast from the cafe over the road.\"            Without giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some  time.  Perhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front  door, the two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that  would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a  head.  But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the  ground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had  over them.  So he decided on the more certain solution, the way things  would go in the natural course of events, and went back in his room  without another word either from him or from the policemen.            He threw himself down on his bed, and from the dressing table he  took the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his  breakfast.   Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he  confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far  better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the  policemen from the dirty cafe.  He felt well and confident, he had  failed to go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be  excused because of the relatively high position he held there.  Should  he really send in his explanation?   He wondered about it.  If nobody  believed him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could  bring Mrs. Grubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the  street, who probably even now were on their way over to the window  opposite.  It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the  policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and  left him alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing  himself.  At the same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking  at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so.  Because those two were sitting there in the next room and had taken his  breakfast, perhaps?  It would have been so pointless to kill himself  that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him  unable.  Maybe, if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in  their mental abilities, it could have been supposed that they had come  to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of  it.  They could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to  the cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he  first emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then  took a second glassful in order to give himself courage, the last one  just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed.            Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that  he struck his teeth against the glass.  \"The supervisor wants to see  you!\" a voice said.  It was only the shout that startled him, this curt,  abrupt, military shout, that he would not have expected from the  policeman called Franz.  In itself, he found the order very welcome.  \"At last!\" he called back, locked the cupboard and, without delay,  hurried into the next room.  The two policemen were standing there and  chased him back into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course.  \"What d'you think you're doing?\" they cried.  \"Think you're going to see  the supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you?  He'd see to it you  got a right thumping, and us and all!\"  \"Let go of me for God's sake!\"  called K., who had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, \"if  you accost me when I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my  evening dress.\"  \"That won't help you,\" said the policemen, who always  became very quiet, almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way  confused him or, to some extent, brought him to his senses.  \"Ridiculous  formalities!\" he grumbled, as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept  it in both his hands for a little while, as if holding it out for the  policemen's inspection.  They shook their heads.  \"It's got to be a  black coat,\"  they said.  At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and  said - without knowing even himself what he meant by it - \"Well it's not  going to be the main trial, after all.\"  The policemen laughed, but  continued to insist, \"It's got to be a black coat.\"  \"Well that's  alright by me if it makes things go any faster,\" said K.  He opened the  wardrobe himself, spent a long time searching through all the clothes,  and chose his best black suit which had a short jacket that had greatly  surprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and  began, carefully, to get dressed.  He secretly told himself that he had  succeeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make  him have a bath.  He watched them to see if they might remember after  all, but of course it never occurred to them, although Willem did not  forget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the message saying that  K. was getting dressed.            Once he was properly dressed, K. had to pass by Willem as he went  through the next room into the one beyond, the door of which was already  wide open.  K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a  typist called 'Miss Buerstner'.  She was in the habit of going out to  work very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never  exchanged more than a few words of greeting with her.  Now, her bedside  table had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk  for these proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it.  He had his  legs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair.            In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at  the photographs belonging to Miss Buerstner that had been put into a  piece of fabric on the wall.  Hung up on the handle of the open window  was a white blouse.  At the window across the street, there was the old  pair again, although now their number had increased, as behind them, and  far taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed  his chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with  his fingers.  \"Josef K.?\" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to  attract K.'s attention as he looked round the room.  K. nodded.  \"I  daresay you were quite surprised by all that's been taking place this  morning,\" said the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#2)"],[1,"gions...  The instructive but appalling scene of this tyrant's sufferings was at  length closed by death, 30th August, 1483.    The selection of this remarkable person as the principal character in  the romance--for it will be easily comprehended that the little love  intrigue of Quentin is only employed as the means of bringing out the  story--afforded considerable facilities to the author. In Louis XI's  time, extraordinary commotions existed throughout all Europe. England's  Civil Wars were ended, rather in appearance than reality, by the short  lived ascendancy of the House of York. Switzerland was asserting that  freedom which was afterwards so bravely defended. In the Empire and in  France, the great vassals of the crown were endeavouring to emancipate  themselves from its control, while Charles of Burgundy by main force,  and Louis more artfully by indirect means, laboured to subject them to  subservience to their respective sovereignties. Louis, while with one  hand he circumvented and subdued his own rebellious vassals, laboured  secretly with the other to aid and encourage the large trading towns of  Flanders to rebel against the Duke of Burgundy, to which their wealth  and irritability naturally disposed them. In the more woodland districts  of Flanders, the Duke of Gueldres, and William de la Marck, called from  his ferocity the Wild Boar of Ardennes, were throwing off the habits  of knights and gentlemen to practise the violences and brutalities of  common bandits.    [Chapter I gives a further account of the conditions of the period which  Quentin Durward portrays.]    A hundred secret combinations existed in the different provinces of  France and Flanders; numerous private emissaries of the restless  Louis, Bohemians, pilgrims, beggars, or agents disguised as such, were  everywhere spreading the discontent which it was his policy to maintain  in the dominions of Burgundy.    Amidst so great an abundance of materials, it was difficult to select  such as should be most intelligible and interesting to the reader: and  the author had to regret, that though he made liberal use of the power  of departing from the reality of history, he felt by no means confident  of having brought his story into a pleasing, compact, and sufficiently  intelligible form. The mainspring of the plot is that which all who know  the least of the feudal system can easily understand, though the facts  are absolutely fictitious. The right of a feudal superior was in nothing  more universally acknowledged than in his power to interfere in the  marriage of a female vassal. This may appear to exist as a contradiction  both of the civil and canon laws, which declare that marriage shall be  free, while the feudal or municipal jurisprudence, in case of a fief  passing to a female, acknowledges an interest in the superior of  the fief to dictate the choice of her companion in marriage. This is  accounted for on the principle that the superior was, by his bounty, the  original granter of the fief, and is still interested that the marriage  of the vassal shall place no one there who may be inimical to his liege  lord. On the other hand, it might be reasonably pleaded that this  right of dictating to the vassal to a certain extent in the choice of  a husband, is only competent to the superior from whom the fief is  originally derived. There is therefore no violent improbability in a  vassal of Burgundy flying to the protection of the King of France, to  whom the Duke of Burgundy himself was vassal; not is it a great stretch  of probability to affirm that Louis, unscrupulous as he was, should have  formed the design of betraying the fugitive into some alliance which  might prove inconvenient, if not dangerous, to his formidable kinsman  and vassal of Burgundy.    [Some of these departures from historical accuracy, as when the death  of the Bishop of Liege is antedated, are duly set forth in the notes.  It should be mentioned that Mr. J. F. Kirk, in his elaborate History of  Charles the Bold, claims that in some points injustice has been done  to the Duke in this romance. He says: \"The faults of Charles were  sufficiently glaring, and scarcely admitted of exaggeration; but his  breeding had been that of a prince, his education had been better than  that of other princes of his time, his tastes and habits were more, not  less, refined than theirs, and the restraint he imposed upon his sensual  appetites was as conspicuous a trait as his sternness and violence.\"]    Abbotsford, 1830.        Quentin Durward was published in June, 1823, and was Scott's first  venture on foreign ground. While well received at home, the sensation  it created in Paris was comparable to that caused by the appearance of  Waverley in Edinburgh and Ivanhoe in London. In Germany also, where the  author was already popular, the new novel had a specially enthusiastic  welcome. The scene of the romance was partly suggested by a journal  kept by Sir Walter's dear friend, Mr. James Skene of Rubislaw, during  a French tour, the diary being illustrated by a vast number of clever  drawings. The author, in telling this tale laid in unfamiliar scenes,  encountered difficulties of a kind quite new to him, as it necessitated  much study of maps, gazetteers, and books of travel. For the history,  he naturally found above all else the Memoirs of Philip de Comines \"the  very key of the period,\" though it need not be said that the lesser  chroniclers received due attention. It is interesting to note that in  writing to his friend, Daniel Terry, the actor and manager, Scott says,  \"I have no idea my present labours will be dramatic in situation; as to  character, that of Louis XI, the sagacious, perfidious, superstitious,  jocular, politic tyrant, would be, for a historical chronicle containing  his life and death, one of the most powerful ever brought on the stage.\"  So thought the poet, Casimir Delavigne--writing when Scott's influence  was marked upon French literature--whose powerful drama, Louis XI, was  a great Parisian success. Later Charles Kean and Henry Irving made an  English version of it well known in England and America.        CHAPTER I: THE CONTRAST         Look here upon this picture, and on this,       The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.         HAMLET      The latter part of the fifteenth century prepared a train of future  events that ended by raising France to that state of formidable power  which has ever since been from time to time the principal object of  jealousy to the other European nations. Before that period she had to  struggle for her very existence with the English already possessed of  her fairest provinces while the utmost exertions of her King, and the  gallantry of her people, could scarcely protect the remainder from a  foreign yoke. Nor was this her sole danger. The princes who possessed  the grand fiefs of the crown, and, in particular, the Dukes of Burgundy  and Bretagne, had come to wear their feudal bonds so lightly that they  had no scruple in lifting the standard against their liege and sovereign  lord, the King of France, on the slightest pretence. When at peace, they  reigned as absolute princes in their own provinces; and the House of  Burgundy, possessed of the district so called, together with the fairest  and richest part of Flanders, was itself so wealthy, and so powerful, as  to yield nothing to the crown, either in splendour or in strength.    In imitation of the grand feudatories, each inferior vassal of the crown  assumed as much independence as his distance from the sovereign power,  the extent of his fief, or the strength of his chateau enabled him to  maintain; and these petty tyrants, no longer amenable to the exercise  of the law, perpetrated with impunity the wildest excesses of fantastic  oppression and cruelty. In Auvergne alone, a report was made of more  than three hundred of these independent nobles, to whom incest, murder,  and rapine were the most ordinary and familiar actions.    Besides these evils, another, springing out of the long continued wars  betwixt the French and English, added no small misery to this distracted  kingdom. Numerous bodies of soldiers, collected into bands, under  officers chosen by themselves, from among the bravest and most  successful adventurers, had been formed in various parts of France out  of the refuse of all other countries. These hireling combatants sold  their swords for a time to the best bidder; and, when such service was  not to be had, they made war on their own account, seizing castles  and towers, which they used as the places of their retreat, making  prisoners, and ransoming them, exacting tribute from the open villages  and the country around them--and acquiring, by every species of rapine,  the appropriate epithets of Tondeurs and Ecorcheurs, that is, Clippers  and Flayers.    In the midst of the horrors and miseries arising from so distracted a  state of public affairs, reckless and profuse expense distinguished the  courts of the lesser nobles, as well as of the superior princes; and  their dependents, in imitation, expended in rude but magnificent display  the wealth which they extorted from the people. A tone of romantic and  chivalrous gallantry (which, however, was often disgraced by unbounded  license) characterized the intercourse between the sexes; and the  language of knight errantry was yet used, and its observances followed,  though the pure spirit of honourable love and benevolent enterprise  which it inculcates had ceased to qualify and atone for its  extravagances. The jousts and tournaments, the entertainments and  revels, which each petty court displayed, invited to France every  wandering adventurer; and it was seldom that, when arrived there, he  failed to employ his rash courage, and headlong spirit of enterprise, in  actions for which his happier native country afforded no free stage.    At this period, and as if to save this fair realm"]]]
