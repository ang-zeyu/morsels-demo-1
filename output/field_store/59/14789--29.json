And of course they had to have a well drilled and  put up a windmill and water tank.    At the end of that two years, they took their two children and  moved into their new house on the first farm they had ever owned.  And Papa, with the aid of an efficient helpmate, continued to  improve the farm.  They built a big barn and shelters for cows,  hogs, horses, poultry, a hack, buggy, harness, and other things.  And the family continued to grow.  George was born in 1900 and a  daughter in 1901.  George lived 26 months and died with the  croup.  The daughter lived only two weeks.  Earl was born in 1902  and Joel in 1904.  This was the state of the family in 1906, the  year Grandpa died in his home, and the year I was born.  Aunts,  Uncles, and cousins lived on three sides of us, and Grandma lived  in the big house a quarter-mile north of us.    My parents were getting quite a collection of children by this  time.  And it is not always easy to find family hand-me-down  names for that many kids.  So by the time the seventh one arrived  they had to go outside the family for a name.  I don't know how  far out they went but they came back with what I have always  thought was a \"far out\" name, Clarence Edgar, and they pinned it  on me.  I was born January 11, 1906, in Jones County, West Texas,  in the middle of a large family.  Frank was eight years old when  I was born, Susie was seven, Earl three, and Joel 16 months.  There were three others born later, Albert, Ollie Mae, and  William Robert.  So, as you can see, my parents thrived and grew  rich--if you count children as wealth.  There were ten of us,  eight of whom attained full size and strength.    Five years after I was born, we moved to another farm about a  half-mile east.  Albert was born at the first place we lived and  William Robert was born at the second farm.  I know Ollie Mae was  born sometime in between those two boys, but I don't know where  she was born.  I'm sure it wasn't between the two farms.  Wherever it was, she became one of us and is still with us.    Mama told me that the $300 they paid Grandpa for the farm was the  hardest debt they ever had to pay off.    Money was hard to come by for a young couple just starting out.    Mama also told me all about how her family had moved from  Kentucky to Dallas County, Texas, then again to Grayson County,  then back to Kentucky, then again to Dallas County, and finally  to Oklahoma.    During all this time Mama's younger brother Hugh was trailing  along two years behind her.  They were seven and nine years old  when they moved back to their old home in Kentucky.  There were  200 acres in the farm, and these two kids had four years in which  to explore the meadows, the hills, the streams, and the  woodlands.  There were three springs of water, acres and acres of  wild berries, wild nuts, cherries, peaches, apples, and papaws.  There were many kinds of birds as well as coons and skunks.  And  for delicious food, there were swamp rabbits and opossums.    I was a young boy when Mama first told me that Hugh was her  favorite brother.  It didn't mean much to me at that time.  But  after I was a grown man, she told in detail how she and Hugh had  roamed together over the old farm during those four years, how  they had picked wild berries, and how they had carried them to  the store in Hodgensville and had sold them for ten cents a  gallon.    Emma's older sister and an older brother had long since married  and lived far away.  Henry was still at home but he was older  than Emma and too busy at other things to be interested in that  kid stuff.  No wonder Hugh was her favorite brother.  They had  played together, explored together, and had grown up together.    When I was young I heard Mama tell that her brother Hugh was shot  to death one day while out on his horse.  I didn't know whether  the Gaddies were living in Kentucky, Texas, or Oklahoma when he  got shot.  When I heard how Hugh had died, I was old enough to  know about Kentucky moonshiners, Texas cattle rustlers, and  Oklahoma desperadoes.  I wondered if any of them had played a  part in his death, but I didn't ask any questions .    Mama told me later that Hugh was a cowboy, had gotten his pay and  was riding home when a man shot him in the back and took his  money.    I was sorry I had ever wondered.    Mama told me that her brother Henry and the blacks around Duncan  were not very friendly toward each other.  At least one time, the  blacks held hands and formed a human chain across the road to  keep Henry from coming by.  But Henry whipped up his horses and  drove right through the crowd.  After that he carried a long  blacksnake whip to use on them if they ever got close to his  wagon again.    Part of the tradition that was handed down to us from the Gaddies  and the Johnsons was that there were only three things to drink--  water, sweet milk, and buttermilk.  You might include clabber if  you like.  But then, clabber was more of an \"eat\" than a drink.  Soda pop was for the wealthy and foolhardy, and coffee was not  permitted for three reasons:  it cost money, it was unnecessary  and it was not good for you.  Money was for necessities.  Any  drinks stronger than these mentioned were strictly forbidden.    Even the sound of the word \"whiskey\" carried with it an inkling  of sin and dishonor.  Whiskey without drunkenness was improbable,  and drunkenness was about as low as a person could go.    Mama grew up to hate whiskey because of its effect on men and  because it tasted bad.  However, there was always a jug of it  under her father's bed--for medical use only.  Any symptom of  disease was treated immediately with whiskey.  Mama hated the  taste of it.    Mama told us about a man--perhaps an uncle--who was sick in bed  and who was fond of whiskey.  As he lay in bed, a few friends and  kinfolks stopped by to see him.  And one by one he asked them to  mix him a little toddy.  They did.    And wouldn't you know it, five or six toddies all in one man at  one time made the man forget he was sick on disease and it made  him fairly sick on whiskey which was what he had planned to be.    After I came into the Johnson family, Mama's people lived so far  away I didn't get to know much about them.    We didn't get around to visiting them much.  But I remember we  did go to Duncan one time to visit some of them.  It seems that  the trip was made in about the year of 1916.  We went in our 1914  model Reo car.    I guess I was about ten years old.  I don't remember much about  the people we went to see, but I remember the white rabbits and  prairie dogs they had for pets.  They were running all over the  place.  I suppose it was Uncle Henry's place and I believe the  pets were Leo's, Uncle Henry's son.  Leo was perhaps four years  older than I was--maybe even more.    I think I met Mama's sister and her older brother, Will, a time  or two; I'm not sure.  But Henry was the only one of them I ever  really knew.    Henry and his wife, I think her name was Emma also, came to  Hamlin to visit Mama and Papa a couple of times after I was  married.  Then, when I was attending college in Arkansas, my  wife, Ima, and our youngest son, Larry, and I stopped by to visit  Uncle Henry two or three times.    During one of those visits, Uncle Henry went out into his garage  and took a book from the bottom of an old trunk.  The book was  similar to a ledger, about seven inches wide and ten inches long,  with a flexible cover.  In the book were 54 songs, handwritten  with pen and ink, most of them in my father's hand, a few written  by my mother.    It was my father's book which he had carried to parties and  singings while he lived in Oklahoma.  When he heard a song he  liked, he would write the words in his book of songs.  Other boys  and girls had their books of songs also, including Uncle Henry.    Uncle Henry also had a mother-in-law--or rather, I think it was  his mother-in-law-to-be--who gave him trouble at times.  One time  she got mad at him for some reason and burned his book of songs.  So Papa loaned Henry his song book.    Then the Johnsons moved away to Texas before Henry returned the  book.  When he was through with the book, Henry hesitated to make  a 400 mile round trip in a covered wagon just to return a  borrowed book.  So he didn't return it right away.  He put it  away for safekeeping.  It was forgotten until Henry mentioned it  during a visit to Texas to see Mama and Papa 50 years later    Mama was about 80 years old when Uncle Henry took the book from  the old trunk and asked me to take it to her.  Papa had died many  years before.    I have one copy of those songs and there is a copy of them filed  away at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.    Neither the Johnsons nor the Gaddies had any part in the Oklahoma  land rush.  That took place in 1889, a few years before either  family arrived in Oklahoma.    I never once saw my Grandma Gaddie.  She passed away in Oklahoma  in 1912.  She suffered a sunstroke and died two weeks later.    Some years after that, Grandpa Gaddie came to live with us in  Texas.  I don't remember exactly when he came, but he passed away  while we were living on the Exum place, and we moved from there  in 1917.  He seemed quite old, maybe old ahead of his time  because of hard work and the severity of life at that time in our  history.    Anyhow, he could do light odd jobs about the farm.  There were  always outside chores to be done.  We "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5430"],[0,"Preface to a Dictionary of the English Language (#2)"],[1,"ble. It will sometimes be found, that  the accent is placed by the authour quoted, on a different syllable  from that marked in the alphabetical series; it is then to be  understood, that custom has varied, or that the authour has, in  my opinion, pronounced wrong. Short directions are sometimes given  where the sound of letters is irregular; and if they are sometimes  omitted, defect in such minute observations will be more easily  excused, than superfluity.    In the investigation both of the orthography and signification of  words, their ETYMOLOGY was necessarily to be considered, and they  were therefore to be divided into primitives and derivatives.  A primitive word, is that which can be traced no further to any  English root; thus circumspect, circumvent, circumstance, delude,  concave and complicate, though compounds in the Latin, are to us  primitives. Derivatives are all those that can be referred to any  word in English of greater simplicity.    The derivatives I have referred to their primitives, with an  accuracy sometimes needless; for who does not see that remoteness  comes from remote, lovely from love, concavity from concave, and  demonstrative from demonstrate? but this grammatical exuberance  the scheme of my work did not allow me to repress. It is of great  importance in examining the general fabrick of a language, to trace  one word from another, by noting the usual modes of derivation and  inflection; and uniformity must be preserved in systematical works,  though sometimes at the expence of particular propriety.    Among other derivatives I have been careful to insert and elucidate  the anomalous plurals of nouns and preterites of verbs, which in  the Teutonick dialects are very frequent, and though familiar to  those who have always used them, interrupt and embarrass the learners  of our language.    The two languages from which our primitives have been derived are  the Roman and Teutonick: under the Roman I comprehend the French  and provincial tongues; and under the Teutonick range the Saxon,  German, and all their kindred dialects. Most of our polysyllables  are Roman, and our words of one syllable are very often Teutonick.    In assigning the Roman original, it has perhaps sometimes happened  that I have mentioned only the Latin, when the word was borrowed  from the French, and considering myself as employed only in the  illustration of my own language, I have not been very careful to  observe whether the Latin word be pure or barbarous, or the French  elegant or obsolete.    For the Teutonick etymologies, I am commonly indebted to Junius  and Skinner, the only names which I have forborn to quote when I  copied their books; not that I might appropriate their labours or  usurp their honours, but that I might spare a perpetual repetition  by one general acknowledgment. Of these, whom I ought not to mention  but with the reverence due to instructors and benefactors, Junius  appears to have excelled in extent of learning, and Skinner in  rectitude of understanding. Junius was accurately skilled in all  the northern languages. Skinner probably examined the ancient and  remoter dialects only by occasional inspection into dictionaries;  but the learning of Junius is often of no other use than to show  him a track by which he may deviate from his purpose, to which  Skinner always presses forward by the shortest way.  Skinner  is often ignorant, but never ridiculous: Junius is always full of  knowledge; but his variety distracts his judgment, and his learning  is very frequently disgraced by his absurdities.    The votaries of the northern muses will not perhaps easily restrain  their indignation, when they find the name of Junius thus degraded  by a disadvantageous comparison; but whatever reverence is due to  his diligence, or his attainments, it can be no criminal degree of  censoriousness to charge that etymologist with want of judgment,  who can seriously derive dream from drama, because life is a drama,  and a drama is a dream? and who declares with a tone of defiance,  that no man can fail to derive moan from [in greek], monos, single  or solitary, who considers that grief naturally loves to be alone.  [Footnote: That I may not appear to have spoken too irreverently of  Junius, I have here subjoined a few Specimens of his etymological  extravagance.

The words which are represented as thus related by descent  or cognation, do not always agree in sense; for it is incident to  words, as to their authours, to degenerate from their ancestors,  and to change their manners when they change their country. It is  sufficient, in etymological enquiries, if the senses of kindred  words be found such as may easily pass into each other, or such as  may both be referred to one general idea.    The etymology, so far as it is yet known, was easily found in the  volumes where it is particularly and professedly delivered; and,  by proper attention to the rules of derivation, the orthography was  soon adjusted. But to COLLECT the WORDS of our language was a task  of greater difficulty: the deficiency of dictionaries was immediately  apparent; and when they were exhausted, what was yet wanting must  be sought by fortuitous and unguided excursions into books, and  gleaned as industry should find, or chance should offer it, in the  boundless chaos of a living speech. My search, however, has been  either skilful or lucky; for I have much augmented the vocabulary.    As my design was a dictionary, common or appellative, I have omitted  all words which have relation to proper names; such as Arian,  Socinian, Calvinist, Benedictine, Mahometan; but have retained  those of a more general nature, as Heathen, Pagan.    Of the terms of art I have received such as could be found either  in books of science or technical dictionaries; and have often  inserted, from philosophical writers, words which are supported  perhaps only by a single authority, and which being not admitted  into general use, stand yet as candidates or probationers, and must  depend for their adoption on the suffrage of futurity.    The words which our authours have introduced by their knowledge  of foreign languages, or ignorance of their own, by vanity or  wantonness, by compliance with fashion or lust of innovation, I  have registred as they occurred, though commonly only to censure  them, and warn others against the folly of naturalizing useless  foreigners to the injury of the natives.    I have not rejected any by design, merely because they were unnecessary  or exuberant; but have received those which by different writers  have been differently formed, as viscid, and viscidity, viscous,  and viscosity.    Compounded or double words I have seldom noted, except when they  obtain a signification different from that which the components have  in their simple state. Thus highwayman, woodman, and horsecourser,  require an explanation; but of thieflike or coachdriver no notice  was needed, because the primitives contain the meaning of the  compounds.    Words arbitrarily formed by a constant and settled analogy, like  diminutive adjectives in ish, as greenish, bluish, adverbs in ly,  as dully, openly, substantives in ness, as vileness, faultiness,  were less diligently sought, and sometimes have been omitted, when  I had no authority that invited me to insert them; not that they are  not genuine and regular offsprings of English roots, but because  their relation to the primitive being always the same, their  signification cannot be mistaken.    The verbal nouns in ing, such as the keeping of the castle,  the leading of the army, are always neglected, or placed only to  illustrate the sense of the verb, except when they signify things as  well as actions, and have therefore a plural number, as dwelling,  living; or have an absolute and abstract signification, as colouring,  painting,"]]]
