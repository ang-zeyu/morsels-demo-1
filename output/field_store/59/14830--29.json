Law  accepted, and had the ill fortune to shoot his antagonist dead upon the  spot. He was arrested the same day, and brought to trial for murder  by the relatives of Mr. Wilson. He was afterwards found guilty, and  sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to a fine, upon the ground  that the offence only amounted to manslaughter. An appeal being lodged  by a brother of the deceased, Law was detained in the King's Bench,  whence, by some means or other, which he never explained, he contrived  to escape; and an action being instituted against the sheriffs, he was  advertised in the Gazette, and a reward offered for his apprehension. He  was described as \"Captain John Law, a Scotchman, aged twenty-six; a  very tall, black, lean man; well shaped, above six feet high, with large  pockholes in his face; big nosed, and speaking broad and loud.\" As this  was rather a caricature than a description of him, it has been supposed  that it was drawn up with a view to favour his escape. He succeeded in  reaching the Continent, where he travelled for three years, and devoted  much of his attention to the monetary and banking affairs of the  countries through which he passed. He stayed a few months in Amsterdam,  and speculated to some extent in the funds. His mornings were devoted  to the study of finance and the principles of trade, and his evenings to  the gaming-house. It is generally believed that he returned to Edinburgh  in the year 1700. It is certain that he published in that city his  \"Proposals and Reasons for constituting a Council of Trade.\" This  pamphlet did not excite much attention.    In a short time afterwards he published a project for establishing what  he called a Land-bank [The wits of the day called it a sand-bank, which  would wreck the vessel of the state.], the notes issued by which  were never to exceed the value of the entire lands of the state, upon  ordinary interest, or were to be equal in value to the land, with the  right to enter into possession at a certain time. The project excited a  good deal of discussion in the Scottish parliament, and a motion for  the establishment of such a bank was brought forward by a neutral  party, called the Squadrone, whom Law had interested in his favour.  The Parliament ultimately passed a resolution to the effect, that, to  establish any kind of paper credit, so as to force it to pass, was an  improper expedient for the nation.    Upon the failure of this project, and of his efforts to procure a pardon  for the murder of Mr. Wilson, Law withdrew to the Continent, and resumed  his old habits of gaming. For fourteen years he continued to roam about,  in Flanders, Holland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and France. He soon  became intimately acquainted with the extent of the trade and resources  of each, and daily more confirmed in his opinion that no country could  prosper without a paper currency. During the whole of this time he  appears to have chiefly supported himself by successful play. At every  gambling-house of note in the capitals of Europe, he was known and  appreciated as one better skilled in the intricacies of chance than any  other man of the day. It is stated in the \"Biographie Universelle\" that  he was expelled, first from Venice, and afterwards from Genoa, by the  magistrates, who thought him a visitor too dangerous for the youth  of those cities. During his residence in Paris he rendered himself  obnoxious to D'Argenson, the lieutenant-general of the police, by whom  he was ordered to quit the capital. This did not take place, however,  before he had made the acquaintance in the saloons, of the Duke de  Vendome, the Prince de Conti, and of the gay Duke of Orleans, the latter  of whom was destined afterwards to exercise so much influence over his  fate. The Duke of Orleans was pleased with the vivacity and good sense  of the Scottish adventurer, while the latter was no less pleased with  the wit and amiability of a prince who promised to become his patron.  They were often thrown into each other's society, and Law seized every  opportunity to instil his financial doctrines into the mind of one whose  proximity to the throne pointed him out as destined, at no very distant  date, to play an important part in the government.    Shortly before the death of Louis XIV, or, as some say, in 1708, Law  proposed a scheme of finance to Desmarets, the Comptroller. Louis is  reported to have inquired whether the projector were a Catholic, and, on  being answered in the negative, to have declined having anything to  do with him. [This anecdote, which is related in the correspondence  of Madame de Baviere, Duchess of Orleans, and mother of the Regent,  is discredited by Lord John Russell, in his \"History of the principal  States of Europe, from the Peace of Utrecht;\" for what reason he  does not inform us. There is no doubt that Law proposed his scheme to  Desmarets, and that Louis refused to hear of it. The reason given for  the refusal is quite consistent with the character of that bigoted and  tyrannical monarch.]    It was after this repulse that he visited Italy. His mind being still  occupied with schemes of finance, he proposed to Victor Amadeus, Duke of  Savoy, to establish his land-bank in that country. The Duke replied that  his dominions were too circumscribed for the execution of so great a  project, and that he was by far too poor a potentate to be ruined. He  advised him, however, to try the King of France once more; for he was  sure, if he knew anything of the French character, that the people would  be delighted with a plan, not only so new, but so plausible.    Louis XIV died in 1715, and the heir to the throne being an infant only  seven years of age, the Duke of Orleans assumed the reins of government,  as Regent, during his minority. Law now found himself in a more  favourable position. The tide in his affairs had come, which, taken at  the flood, was to waft him on to fortune. The Regent was his friend,  already acquainted with his theory and pretensions, and inclined,  moreover, to aid him in any efforts to restore the wounded credit of  France, bowed down to the earth by the extravagance of the long reign of  Louis XIV.    Hardly was that monarch laid in his grave ere the popular hatred,  suppressed so long, burst forth against his memory. He who, during his  life, had been flattered with an excess of adulation, to which history  scarcely offers a parallel, was now cursed as a tyrant, a bigot, and  a plunderer. His statues were pelted and disfigured; his effigies  torn down, amid the execrations of the populace, and his name rendered  synonymous with selfishness and oppression. The glory of his arms  was forgotten, and nothing was remembered but his reverses, his  extravagance, and his cruelty.    The finances of the country were in a state of the utmost disorder.  A profuse and corrupt monarch, whose profuseness and corruption were  imitated by almost every functionary, from the highest to the lowest  grade, had brought France to the verge of ruin. The national debt  amounted to 3000 millions of livres, the revenue to 145 millions, and  the expenditure to 142 millions per annum; leaving only three millions  to pay the interest upon 3000 millions. The first care of the Regent was  to discover a remedy for an evil of such magnitude, and a council was  early summoned to take the matter into consideration. The Duke de St.  Simon was of opinion that nothing could save the country from revolution  but a remedy at once bold and dangerous. He advised the Regent to  convoke the States-General, and declare a national bankruptcy. The  Duke de Noailles, a man of accommodating principles, an accomplished  courtier, and totally averse from giving himself any trouble or  annoyance that ingenuity could escape from, opposed the project of St.  Simon with all his influence. He represented the expedient as alike  dishonest and ruinous. The Regent was of the same opinion, and this  desperate remedy fell to the ground.    The measures ultimately adopted, though they promised fair, only  aggravated the evil. The first, and most dishonest measure, was of no  advantage to the state. A recoinage was ordered, by which the currency  was depreciated one-fifth; those who took a thousand pieces of gold or  silver to the mint received back an amount of coin of the same nominal  value, but only four-fifths of the weight of metal. By this contrivance  the treasury gained seventy-two millions of livres, and all the  commercial operations of the country were disordered. A trifling  diminution of the taxes silenced the clamours of the people, and for the  slight present advantage the great prospective evil was forgotten.    A chamber of justice was next instituted, to inquire into the  malversations of the loan-contractors and the farmers of the revenues.  Tax collectors are never very popular in any country, but those of  France at this period deserved all the odium with which they were  loaded. As soon as these farmers-general, with all their hosts of  subordinate agents, called maltotiers [From maltote, an oppressive  tax.], were called to account for their misdeeds, the most extravagant  joy took possession of the nation. The Chamber of Justice, instituted  chiefly for this purpose, was endowed with very extensive powers. It was  composed of the presidents and councils of the parliament, the judges  of the Courts of Aid and of Requests, and the officers of the Chamber  of Account, under the general presidence of the minister of finance.  Informers were encouraged to give evidence against the offenders by the  promise of one-fifth part of the fines and confiscations. A tenth of all  concealed effects belonging to the guilty was promised to such as should  furnish the means of discovering them.    The promulgation of the edict constituting this court caused a degree  of consternation among those"]]]
