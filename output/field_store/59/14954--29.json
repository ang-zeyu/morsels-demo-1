We have time,\" Eliza explained.    So the two little girls hid themselves behind the lilac-bushes that  grew beside the rocks in which was the little cave which they called  Napoleon's grotto. The bush concealed them from view; two pairs of  wide-open black eyes peering curiously between the lilac-leaves were  the only signs of the mischievous young eavesdroppers.    The boy who was walking thoughtfully toward the grotto did not notice  the little girls. He was about seven years old. In fact, he was seven  that very day. For he was born in the big, bare house in Ajaccio, which  was his home, on the fifteenth of August, 1776.    He was an odd-looking boy. He was almost elf-like in appearance. His  head was big, his body small, his arms and legs were thin and spindling.  His long, dark hair fell about his face; his dress was careless and  disordered; his stockings had tumbled down over his shoes, and he looked  much like an untidy boy. But one scarcely noticed the dress of this boy.  It was his face that held the attention.    It was an Italian face; for this boy's ancestors had come, not so many  generations before, from the Tuscan town of Sarzana, on the Gulf of  Genoa--the very town from which \"the brave Lord of Luna,\" of whom you  may read in Macaulay's splendid poem of \"Horatius,\" came to the sack  of Rome. Save for his odd appearance, with his big head and his little  body, there was nothing to particularly distinguish the boy Napoleon  Bonaparte from other children of his own age.    Now and then, indeed, his face would show all the shifting emotions  of ambition, passion, and determination; and his eyes, though not  beautiful, had in them a piercing and commanding gleam that, with a  glance, could influence and attract his companions.    Whatever happened, these wonderful eyes--even in the boy--never lost the  power of control which they gave to their owner over those about him.  With a look through those eyes, Napoleon would appear to conceal his own  thoughts and learn those of others. They could flash in anger if need  be, or smile in approval; but, before their fixed and piercing glance,  even the boldest and most inquisitive of other eyes lowered their lids.    Of course this eye-power, as we might call it, grew as the boy grew; but  even as a little fellow in his Corsican home, this attraction asserted  itself, as many a playfellow and foeman could testify, from Joey Fesch,  his boy-uncle, to whom he was much attached, to Joseph his older  brother, with whom he was always quarrelling, and Giacommetta, the  little black-eyed girl, about whom the boys of Ajaccio teased him.    The little girls behind the lilac-bush watched the boy curiously.    \"Why does he walk like that?\" asked Panoria, as she noted Napoleon's  advance. He came slowly, his eyes fixed on the sea, his hands clasped  behind his back.    \"Our uncle the canon,\" whispered Eliza; \"he walks just that way, and  Napoleon copies him.\"    \"My, he looks about fifty!\" said Panoria. \"What do you suppose he is  thinking about?\"    \"Not about us, be sure,\" Eliza declared.    \"I believe he's dreaming,\" said mischievous Panoria; \"let us scream out,  and see if we can frighten him.\"    \"Silly! you can't frighten Napoleon,\" Eliza asserted, clapping a hand  over her companion's mouth. \"But he could frighten you. I have tried  it.\"    Napoleon stood a moment looking seaward, and tossed back his long hair,  as if to bathe his forehead in the cooling breezes. Then entering the  grotto, he flung himself on its rocky floor, and, leaning his head upon  his hand, seemed as lost in meditation as any gray old hermit of the  hills, all unconscious of the four black eyes which, filled with  curiosity and fun, were watching him from behind the lilac-bush.    [Illustration: _At Napoleon's Grotto_]    \"Here, at least,\" the boy said, speaking aloud, as if he wished the  broad sea to share his thoughts, \"here I am master, here I am alone;  here no one can command or control me. I am seven years old to-day.  One is not a man at seven; that I know. But neither is one a child when  he has my desires. Our uncle, the Canon Lucien, tells me that Spartan  boys were taken away from the women when they were seven years old, and  trained by men. I wish I were a Spartan. There are too many here to say  what I may and may not do,--Mamma Letitia, our uncle the canon, Papa  Charles, Nurse Saveria, Nurse Camilla, to say nothing of my boy-uncle  Fesch, my brother Joseph, and sister Eliza; Uncle Joey Fesch is but four  years older than I, my brother Joseph is but a year older, and Eliza is  a year younger! Even little Pauline has her word to put in against me.  Bah! why should they? If now I were but the master at home, as I am  here\"--    \"Well, hermit! and what if you were the master?\" cried Eliza from the  lilac-bush.    The two girls had kept silence as long as they could; and now, to keep  Panoria from speaking out, Eliza had interrupted with her question.    With that, they both ran into the grotto.    Napoleon was silent a moment, as if protesting against this invasion of  his privacy. Then he said,--\"If I were the master, Eliza, I would make  you both do penance for listening at doors;\" for it especially mortified  this boy to be overheard talking to himself.    \"But here are no doors, Napoleon!\" cried Eliza, whirling about in the  grotto.    \"So much the worse, then,\" Napoleon returned hotly. \"When there are no  doors, one should be even more careful about intruding.\"    \"Pho! hear the little lord,\" teased Eliza. \"One would think he was the  Emperor what's his name, or the Grand Turk.\"    Napoleon was about to respond still more sharply, when just then a  shrill voice rang through the grotto.    \"Eliza; Panoria! Panoria; Eliza!\" the call came. \"Where are you,  runaways? Where are you hidden?\"    \"Here we are, Saveria,\" Eliza cried in reply, but making no move to  retire.    Napoleon would have put the girls out, but the next moment a tall and  stout young woman appeared at the entrance of the grotto. She was  dressed in black, with a black shawl draped over her high hair, and held  by a silver pin. On her arm she carried a large basket filled with  fine fruit,--pears, grapes, and figs. \"So here you are, in Napoleon's  grotto!\" exclaimed Saveria the nurse, dropping with her basket on the  ground. \"Why did you run from me, naughty ones?\"    Napoleon noted the basket's luscious contents.    \"Oh, a pear! Give me a pear, Saveria!\" he cried, springing toward the  nurse, and thrusting a hand into the basket.    But Nurse Saveria hastily drew away the basket.    \"Why, child, child! what are you doing?\" she exclaimed. \"These are your  uncle the canon's.\"    Napoleon withdrew his hand as sharply as if a bee amid the fruit had  stung him.    \"Ah, is it so?\" he cried; but Panoria, not having before her eyes the  fear of the Bonapartes' bugbear, \"their uncle the canon,\" laughed  loudly.    \"What funny people you all are!\" she exclaimed. \"One needs but to cry,  'Your uncle the canon,' and down you all tumble like a house of cards.  What! is Saveria, too, afraid of him?\"    \"No more than I am,\" said Napoleon stoutly.    \"No more than you!\" laughed Panoria. \"Why, Napoleon, you did not dare to  even touch the pears of your uncle the canon.\"    \"Because I did not wish to, Panoria,\" replied Napoleon.    \"Did not dare to,\" corrected Panoria.    \"Did not wish to,\" insisted Napoleon.    \"Well, wish it! I dare you to wish it!\" cried Panoria, while Eliza  looked on horrified at her little friend's suggestion.    By this time Saveria had led the children from the grotto, and, walking  on ahead, was returning toward their home. She did not hear Panoria's  \"dare.\"    \"You may dare me,\" Napoleon replied to the challenge of Panoria; \"but if  I do not wish it, you gain nothing by daring me.\"    \"Ho! you are afraid, little boy!\" cried Panoria.    \"I afraid?\" and Napoleon turned his piercing glance upon the little  girl, so that she quailed before it.    But Panoria was an obstinate child, and she returned to the charge.    \"But if you did wish it, would you do it, Napoleon?\" she asked. \"Of  course,\" the boy replied.    \"Oh, it is easy to brag,\" said Panoria; \"but when your great man, your  uncle the canon, is around, you are no braver, I'll be bound, than  little Pauline, or even Eliza here.\"    By this time Eliza, too, had grown brave; and she said stoutly to her  friend, \"What! I am not brave, you say? You shall see.\"    Then as Saveria, turning, bade them hurry on, Eliza caught Panoria's  hand, and ran toward the nurse; but as she did so, she said to Panoria,  boastingly and rashly,--    \"Come into our house! If I do not eat some of those very pears out  of that very basket of our uncle the canon's, then you may call me a  coward, Panoria!\"    \"Would you then dare?\" cried Panoria. \"I'll not believe it unless I see  you.\"    Eliza was \"in for it\" now. \"Then you shall see me!\" she declared. \"Come  to my house. Mamma Letitia is away visiting, and I shall have the best  chance. I promise you; you shall see.\"    \"Hurry, then,\" said Panoria. \"It is better than braving the black elves,  this that you are to do, Eliza. For truly I think your uncle the canon  must be an ogre.\"    \"You shall see,\" Eliza declared again; and, running after Nurse Saveria,  they were soon in the narrow street in which, standing across the way  from a little park, was the big, bare, yellowish-gray, four-story house  in which lived the Bonaparte family, always hard pushed for money, and  having but few of the fine things which so large a house seemed to call  for. Indeed, they would have had scarcely anything to live on had it not  been for this same important relative, \"our uncle, the Canon Lucien,\"  who spent much of his yearly salary of fifteen hundred "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#2)"],[1,"recovering the steamship Boldero, which foundered and went down off  that coast in the recent gale.  Not only has all hope been abandoned of  raising the vessel, but it is feared that no part of the three hundred  thousand dollars in gold bullion which she carried will ever be  recovered. Expert divers who were taken to the scene of the wreck state  that the depth of water, and the many currents existing there, due to a  submerged shoal, preclude any possibility of getting at the hull. The  bullion, it is believed, was to have been used to further the interests  of a certain revolutionary faction, but it seems likely that they will  have to look elsewhere for the sinews of war.  Besides the bullion the  ship also carried several cases of rifles, it is stated, and other  valuable cargo. The crew and what few passengers the Boldero carried  were, contrary to the first reports, all saved by taking to the boats.  It appears that some of the ship's plates were sprung by the stress in  which she labored in a storm, and she filled and sank gradually.'  There! what do you think of that, dad?\" cried Tom as he finished.    \"What do I think of it? Why, I think it's too bad for the  revolutionists, Tom, of course.\"    \"No; I mean about the treasure being still on board the ship. What  about that?\"    \"Well, it's likely to stay there, if the divers can't get at it. Now,  Mr. Sharp, about the propellers--\"    \"Wait, dad!\" cried Tom earnestly.    \"Why, Tom, what's the matter?\" asked Mr. Swift in some surprise.    \"How soon before we can finish our submarine?\" went on Tom, not  answering the question.    \"About a month. Why?\"    \"Why? Dad, why can't we have a try for that treasure? It ought to be  comparatively easy to find that sunken ship off the coast of Uruguay.  In our submarine we can get close up to it, and in the new diving suits  you invented we can get at that gold bullion. Three hundred thousand  dollars! Think of it, dad! Three hundred thousand dollars! We could  easily claim all of it, since the owners have abandoned it, but we  would be satisfied with half. Let's hurry up, finish the submarine, and  have a try for it.\"    \"But, Tom, you forget that I am to enter my new ship in the trials for  the prize offered by the United States Government.\"    \"How much is the prize if you win it?\" asked Tom.    \"Fifty thousand dollars.\"    \"Well, here's a chance to make three times that much at least, and  maybe more. Dad, let the Government prize go, and try for the treasure.  Will you?\"    Tom looked eagerly at his father, his eyes shining with anticipation.  Mr. Swift was not a quick thinker, but the idea his son had proposed  made an impression on him. He reached out his hand for the paper in  which the young inventor had seen the account of the sunken treasure.  Slowly he read it through. Then he passed it to Mr. Sharp.    \"What do you think of it?\" he asked of the aeronaut.    \"There's a possibility,\" remarked the balloonist \"We might try for it.  We can easily go three miles down, and it doesn't lie as deeply as  that, if this account is true. Yes, we might try for it. But we'd have  to omit the Government contests.\"    \"Will you, dad?\" asked Tom again.    Mr. Swift considered a moment longer.    \"Yes, Tom, I will,\" he finally decided. \"Going after the treasure will  be likely to afford us a better test of the submarine than would any  Government tests. We'll try to locate the sunken Boldero.\"    \"Hurrah!\" cried the lad, taking the paper from Mr. Sharp and waving it  in the air. \"That's the stuff!  Now for a search for the submarine  treasure!\"          Chapter Two    Finishing the Submarine      \"What's the matter?\" cried Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, hurrying in  from the kitchen, where she was washing the dishes. \"Have you seen some  of those scoundrels who robbed you, Mr. Swift? If you have, the police  down here ought to--\"    \"No, it's nothing like that,\" explained Mr. Swift. \"Tom has merely  discovered in the paper an account of a sunken treasure ship, and he  wants us to go after it, down under the ocean.\"    \"Oh, dear! Some more of Captain Kidd's hidden hoard, I suppose?\"  ventured the housekeeper. \"Don't you bother with it, Mr. Swift. I had a  cousin once, and he got set in the notion that he knew where that  pirate's treasure was. He spent all the money he had and all he could  borrow digging for it, and he never found a penny. Don't waste your  time on such foolishness. It's bad enough to be building airships and  submarines without going after treasure.\"  Mrs. Baggert spoke with the  freedom of an old friend rather than a hired housekeeper, but she had  been in the family ever since Tom's mother died, when he was a baby,  and she had many privileges.    \"Oh, this isn't any of Kidd's treasure,\" Tom assured her.  \"If we get  it, Mrs. Baggert, I'll buy you a diamond ring.\"    \"Humph!\" she exclaimed, as Tom began to hug her in boyish fashion. \"I  guess I'll have to buy all the diamond rings I want, if I have to  depend on your treasure for them,\" and she went back to the kitchen.    \"Well,\" went on Mr. Swift after a pause, \"if we are going into the  treasure-hunting business, Tom, we'll have to get right to work. In the  first place, we must find out more about this ship, and just where it  was sunk.\"    \"I can do that part,\" said Mr. Sharp. \"I know some sea captains, and  they can put me on the track of locating the exact spot. In fact, it  might not be a bad idea to take an expert navigator with us. I can  manage in the air all right, but I confess that working out a location  under water is beyond me.\"    \"Yes, an old sea captain wouldn't be a bad idea, by any means,\"  conceded Mr. Swift. \"Well, if you'll attend to that detail, Mr. Sharp,  Tom, Mr. Jackson and I will finish the submarine. Most of the work is  done, however, and it only remains to install the engine and motors.  Now, in regard to the negative and positive electric plates, I'd like  your opinion, Tom.\"    For Tom Swift was an inventor, second in ability only to his father,  and his advice was often sought by his parent on matters of electrical  construction, for the lad had made a specialty of that branch of  science.    While father and son were deep in a discussion of the apparatus of the  submarine, there will be an opportunity to make the reader a little  better acquainted with them. Those of you who have read the previous  volumes of this series do not need to be told who Tom Swift is. Others,  however, may be glad to have a proper introduction to him.    Tom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, in the village of  Shopton, New York. The Swift home was on the outskirts of the town, and  the large house was surrounded by a number of machine shops, in which  father and son, aided by Garret Jackson, the engineer, did their  experimental and constructive work. Their house was not far from Lake  Carlopa, a fairly large body of water, on which Tom often speeded his  motor-boat.    In the first volume of this series, entitled \"Tom Swift and His  Motor-Cycle,\" it was told how he became acquainted with Mr. Wakefield  Damon, who suffered an accident while riding one of the speedy  machines. The accident disgusted Mr. Damon with motor-cycles, and Tom  secured it for a low price. He had many adventures on it, chief among  which was being knocked senseless and robbed of a valuable patent model  belonging to his father, which he was taking to Albany. The attack was  committed by a gang known as the Happy Harry gang, who were acting at  the instigation of a syndicate of rich men, who wanted to secure  control of a certain patent turbine engine which Mr. Swift had invented.    Tom set out in pursuit of the thieves, after recovering from their  attack, and had a strenuous time before he located them.    In the second volume, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat,\" there  was related our hero's adventures in a fine craft which was recovered  from the thieves and sold at auction. There was a mystery connected  with the boat, and for a long time Tom could not solve it. He was  aided, however, by his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in the Shopton  Bank, and also by Mr. Damon and Eradicate Sampson, an aged colored  whitewasher, who formed quite an attachment for Tom.    In his motor-boat Tom had more than one race with Andy Foger, a rich  lad of Shopton, who was a sort of bully. He had red hair and squinty  eyes, and was as mean in character as he was in looks. He and his  cronies, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey, made trouble for Tom, chiefly  because Tom managed to beat Andy twice in boat races.    It was while in his motor-boat, Arrow, that Tom formed the acquaintance  of John Sharp, a veteran balloonist. While coming down Lake Carlopa on  the way to the Swift home, which had been entered by thieves, Tom, his  father and Ned Newton, saw a balloon on fire over the lake. Hanging  from a trapeze on it was Mr. Sharp, who had made an ascension from a  fair ground. By hard work on the part of Tom and his friends the  aeronaut was saved, and took up his residence with the Swifts.    His advent was most auspicious, for Tom and his father were then  engaged in perfecting an airship, and Mr. Sharp was able to lend them  his skill, so that the craft was soon constructed.    In the third volume, called \"Tom Swift and His Airship,\" there was set  down the doings of the young inventor, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon on a  trip above the clouds. They undertook it merely for pleasure, but they  encountered considerable danger, before they completed it, for they  nearly fell into a blazing forest once, and were later fired at by a  crowd of excited people. This last act was to effect their capture, for  they were taken for a gang of bank robbers, and this was due directly  to Andy Foger.    The morning after Tom and his friends started on their trip in the air,  the Shopton Bank was found to have been looted of seventy-five thousand  dollars. Andy Foger at once told the"]]]
