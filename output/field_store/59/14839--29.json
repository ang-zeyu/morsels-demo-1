The little prince was thus an object of great attention at the very  commencement of his days, His mother had his portrait painted, and  sent it to _her_ mother in France. She did not, however, in the letters  which accompanied the picture, though his mother, praise the beauty  of her child. She said, in fact, that he was so ugly that she was  ashamed of him, though his size and plumpness, she added, atoned for  the want of beauty. And then he was so comically serious and grave in  the expression of his countenance! the queen said she verily believed  that he was wiser than herself.    As the young prince advanced in years, the religious and political  difficulties in the English nation increased, and by the time that he  had arrived at an age when he could begin to receive impressions from  the conversation and intercourse of those around him, the Parliament  began to be very jealous of the influence which his mother might exert.  They were extremely anxious that he should be educated a Protestant,  and were very much afraid that his mother would contrive to initiate  him secretly into the ideas and practices of the Catholic faith.    She insisted that she did not attempt to do this, and perhaps she did  not; but in those days it was often considered right to make false  pretensions and to deceive, so far as this was necessary to promote  the cause of true religion. The queen did certainly make some efforts  to instill Catholic principles into the minds of some of her children;  for she had other children after the birth of Charles. She gave a  daughter a crucifix one day, which is a little image of Christ upon  the cross, made usually of ivory, or silver, or gold, and also a rosary,  which is a string of beads, by means of which the Catholics are assisted  to count their prayers. Henrietta gave these things to her daughter  secretly, and told her to hide them in her pocket, and taught her how  to use them. The Parliament considered such attempts to influence the  minds of the royal children as very heinous sins, and they made such  arrangements for secluding the young prince Charles from his mother,  and putting the others under the guidance of Protestant teachers and  governors, as very much interfered with Henrietta's desires to enjoy  the society of her children. Since England was a Protestant realm, a  Catholic lady, in marrying an English king, ought not to have expected,  perhaps, to have been allowed to bring up her children in her own  faith; still, it must have been very hard for a mother to be forbidden  to teach her own children what she undoubtedly believed was the only  possible means of securing for them the favor and protection of Heaven.    There is in London a vast storehouse of books, manuscripts, relics,  curiosities, pictures, and other memorials of by-gone days, called the  British Museum. Among the old records here preserved are various letters  written by Henrietta, and one or two by Charles, the young prince,  during his childhood. Here is one, for instance, written by Henrietta  to her child, when the little prince was but eight years of age, chiding  him for not being willing to take his medicine. He was at that time  under the charge of Lord Newcastle.    \"CHARLES,--I am sorry that I must begin my first letter with chiding  you, because I hear that you will not take phisicke, I hope it was  onlie for this day, and that to-morrow you will do it for if you will  not, I must come to you, and _make_ you take it, for it is for your  health. I have given order to mi Lord of Newcastle to send mi word  to-night whether you will or not. Therefore I hope you will not give  me the paines to goe; and so I rest, your affectionate mother,                                         HENRIETTE MARIE.\"    The letter was addressed    \"To MI DEARE SONNE the Prince.\"    The queen must have taken special pains with this her first letter to  her son, for, with all its faults of orthography, it is very much more  correct than most of the epistles which she attempted to write in  English. She was very imperfectly acquainted with the English language,  using, as she almost always did, in her domestic intercourse, her own  native tongue.    Time passed on, and the difficulties and contests between King Charles  and his people and Parliament became more and more exciting and  alarming. One after another of the king's most devoted and faithful  ministers was arrested, tried, condemned, and beheaded, notwithstanding  all the efforts which their sovereign master could make to save them.  Parties were formed, and party spirit ran very high. Tumults were  continually breaking out about the palaces, which threatened the  personal safety of the king and queen. Henrietta herself was a special  object of the hatred which these outbreaks expressed. The king himself  was half distracted by the overwhelming difficulties of his position.  Bad as it was in England, it was still worse in Scotland. There was  an actual rebellion there, and the urgency of the danger in that quarter  was so great that Charles concluded to go there, leaving the poor queen  at home to take care of herself and her little ones as well as she  could, with the few remaining means of protection yet left at her  disposal.    There was an ancient mansion, called Oatlands, not very far from London,  where the queen generally resided during the absence of her husband.  It was a lonely place, on low and level ground, and surrounded by moats  filled with water, over which those who wished to enter passed by draw  bridges. Henrietta chose this place for her residence because she  thought she should be safer there from mobs and violence. She kept the  children all there except the Prince of Wales, who was not allowed to  be wholly under her care. He, how ever, often visited his mother, and  she sometimes visited him.    During the absence of her husband, Queen Henrietta was subjected to  many severe and heavy trials. Her communications with him were often  interrupted and broken. She felt a very warm interest in the prosperity  and success of his expedition, and sometimes the tidings she received  from him encouraged her to hope that all might yet be well. Here, for  instance, is a note which she addressed one day to an officer who had  sent her a letter from the king, that had come enclosed to him. It is  written in a broken English, which shows how imperfectly the foreign  lady had learned the language of her adopted country. They who  understand the French language will be interested in observing that  most of the errors which the writer falls into are those which result  naturally from the usages of her mother tongue.    _Queen Henrietta to Sir Edward Nicholas_.    \"MAISTRE NICHOLAS,--I have reseaved your letter, and that you send me  from the king, which writes me word he as been vere well reseaved in  Scotland; that both the armi and the people have shewed a creat joy  to see the king, and such that theay say was never seen before. Pray  God it may continue.                                     Your friend, HENRIETTE MARIE R.\"    At one time during the king's absence in Scotland the Parliament  threatened to take the queen's children all away from her, for fear,  as they said, that she would make papists of them. This danger alarmed  and distressed the queen exceedingly. She declared that she did not  intend or desire to bring up her children in the Catholic faith. She  knew this was contrary to the wish of the king her husband, as well  as of the people of England. In order to diminish the danger that the  children would be taken away, she left Oatlands herself, and went to  reside at other palaces, only going occasionally to visit her children.  Though she was thus absent from them in person, her heart was with  them all the time, and she was watching with great solicitude and  anxiety for any indications of a design on the part of her enemies to  come and take them away.    At last she received intelligence that an armed force was ordered to  assemble one night in the vicinity of Oatlands to seize her children,  under the pretext that the queen was herself forming plans for removing  them out of the country and taking them to France. Henrietta was a  lady of great spirit and energy, and this threatened danger to her  children aroused all her powers. She sent immediately to all the friends  about her on whom she could rely, and asked them to come, armed and  equipped, and with as many followers as they could muster, to the park  at Oatlands that night. There were also then in and near London a  number of officers of the army, absent from their posts on furlough.  She sent similar orders to these. All obeyed the summons with eager  alacrity. The queen mustered and armed her own household, too, down  to the lowest servants of the kitchen. By these means quite a little  army was collected in the park at Oatlands, the separate parties coming  in, one after another, in the evening and night. This guard patrolled  the grounds till morning, the queen herself animating them by her  presence and energy. The children, whom the excited mother was thus  guarding, like a lioness defending her young, were all the time within  the mansion, awaiting in infantile terror some dreadful calamity, they  scarcely knew what, which all this excitement seemed to portend.    The names and ages of the queen's children at this time were as follows:    Charles, prince of Wales, the subject of this story, eleven.    Mary, ten. Young as she was, she was already married, having been  espoused a short time before to William, prince of Orange, who was one  year older than herself.    James, duke of York, seven. He became afterward King James II.    Elizabeth, six.    Henry, an infant only a few months old.    The night passed away without any attack, though a considerable force  assembled in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6675"],[0,"The Loss of the S. S. Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#2)"],[1,"elliptical funnels, 24 feet 6 inches  in the widest diameter, took away smoke and water gases; the fourth  one was a dummy for ventilation.    She was fitted with 16 lifeboats 30 feet long, swung on davits of the  Welin double-acting type. These davits are specially designed for  dealing with two, and, where necessary, three, sets of lifeboats,--i.e.,  48 altogether; more than enough to have saved every soul on board  on the night of the collision. She was divided into 16 compartments by  15 transverse watertight bulkheads reaching from the double bottom  to the upper deck in the forward end and to the saloon deck in the  after end (Fig. 2), in both cases well above the water line.  Communication between the engine rooms and boiler rooms was  through watertight doors, which could all be closed instantly from the  captain's bridge: a single switch, controlling powerful electro-magnets,  operated them. They could also be closed by hand with a lever,  and in case the floor below them was flooded by accident, a  float underneath the flooring shut them automatically. These  compartments were so designed that if the two largest were flooded  with water--a most unlikely contingency in the ordinary way--the ship  would still be quite safe. Of course, more than two were flooded the  night of the collision, but exactly how many is not yet thoroughly  established.    Her crew had a complement of 860, made up of 475 stewards, cooks,  etc., 320 engineers, and 65 engaged in her navigation. The machinery  and equipment of the Titanic was the finest obtainable and represented  the last word in marine construction. All her structure was of steel,  of a weight, size, and thickness greater than that of any ship yet  known: the girders, beams, bulkheads, and floors all of exceptional  strength. It would hardly seem necessary to mention this, were it not  that there is an impression among a portion of the general public that  the provision of Turkish baths, gymnasiums, and other so-called  luxuries involved a sacrifice of some more essential things, the  absence of which was responsible for the loss of so many lives. But  this is quite an erroneous impression. All these things were an  additional provision for the comfort and convenience of passengers,  and there is no more reason why they should not be provided on these  ships than in a large hotel. There were places on the Titanic's deck  where more boats and rafts could have been stored without sacrificing  these things. The fault lay in not providing them, not in designing  the ship without places to put them. On whom the responsibility must  rest for their not being provided is another matter and must be left  until later.    When arranging a tour round the United States, I had decided to cross  in the Titanic for several reasons--one, that it was rather a novelty  to be on board the largest ship yet launched, and another that friends  who had crossed in the Olympic described her as a most comfortable  boat in a seaway, and it was reported that the Titanic had been still  further improved in this respect by having a thousand tons more built  in to steady her. I went on board at Southampton at 10 A.M. Wednesday,  April 10, after staying the night in the town. It is pathetic to  recall that as I sat that morning in the breakfast room of an hotel,  from the windows of which could be seen the four huge funnels of the  Titanic towering over the roofs of the various shipping offices  opposite, and the procession of stokers and stewards wending their way  to the ship, there sat behind me three of the Titanic's passengers  discussing the coming voyage and estimating, among other things, the  probabilities of an accident at sea to the ship. As I rose from  breakfast, I glanced at the group and recognized them later on board,  but they were not among the number who answered to the roll-call on  the Carpathia on the following Monday morning.    Between the time of going on board and sailing, I inspected, in the  company of two friends who had come from Exeter to see me off, the  various decks, dining-saloons and libraries; and so extensive were  they that it is no exaggeration to say that it was quite easy to lose  one's way on such a ship. We wandered casually into the gymnasium on  the boatdeck, and were engaged in bicycle exercise when the instructor  came in with two photographers and insisted on our remaining there  while his friends--as we thought at the time--made a record for him of  his apparatus in use. It was only later that we discovered that they  were the photographers of one of the illustrated London papers. More  passengers came in, and the instructor ran here and there, looking the  very picture of robust, rosy-cheeked health and \"fitness\" in his white  flannels, placing one passenger on the electric \"horse,\" another on  the \"camel,\" while the laughing group of onlookers watched the  inexperienced riders vigorously shaken up and down as he controlled  the little motor which made the machines imitate so realistically  horse and camel exercise.    It is related that on the night of the disaster, right up to the time  of the Titanic's sinking, while the band grouped outside the gymnasium  doors played with such supreme courage in face of the water which rose  foot by foot before their eyes, the instructor was on duty inside,  with passengers on the bicycles and the rowing-machines, still  assisting and encouraging to the last. Along with the bandsmen it is  fitting that his name, which I do not think has yet been put on  record--it is McCawley--should have a place in the honourable list of  those who did their duty faithfully to the ship and the line they  served.          CHAPTER II    FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO THE NIGHT OF THE COLLISION      Soon after noon the whistles blew for friends to go ashore, the  gangways were withdrawn, and the Titanic moved slowly down the dock,  to the accompaniment of last messages and shouted farewells of those  on the quay. There was no cheering or hooting of steamers' whistles  from the fleet of ships that lined the dock, as might seem probable on  the occasion of the largest vessel in the world putting to sea on her  maiden voyage; the whole scene was quiet and rather ordinary, with  little of the picturesque and interesting ceremonial which imagination  paints as usual in such circumstances. But if this was lacking, two  unexpected dramatic incidents supplied a thrill of excitement and  interest to the departure from dock. The first of these occurred just  before the last gangway was withdrawn:--a knot of stokers ran along  the quay, with their kit slung over their shoulders in bundles, and  made for the gangway with the evident intention of joining the ship.  But a petty officer guarding the shore end of the gangway firmly  refused to allow them on board; they argued, gesticulated, apparently  attempting to explain the reasons why they were late, but he remained  obdurate and waved them back with a determined hand, the gangway was  dragged back amid their protests, putting a summary ending to their  determined efforts to join the Titanic. Those stokers must be thankful  men to-day that some circumstance, whether their own lack of  punctuality or some unforeseen delay over which they had no control,  prevented their being in time to run up that last gangway! They will  have told--and will no doubt tell for years--the story of how their  lives were probably saved by being too late to join the Titanic.    The second incident occurred soon afterwards, and while it has no  doubt been thoroughly described at the time by those on shore, perhaps  a view of the occurrence from the deck of the Titanic will not be  without interest. As the Titanic moved majestically down the dock, the  crowd of friends keeping pace with us along the quay, we came together  level with the steamer New York lying moored to the side of the dock  along with the Oceanic, the crowd waving \"good-byes\" to those on board  as well as they could for the intervening bulk of the two ships. But  as the bows of our ship came about level with those of the New York,  there came a series of reports like those of a revolver, and on the  quay side of the New York snaky coils of thick rope flung themselves  high in the air and fell backwards among the crowd, which retreated in  alarm to escape the flying ropes. We hoped that no one was struck by  the ropes, but a sailor next to me was certain he saw a woman carried  away to receive attention. And then, to our amazement the New York  crept towards us, slowly and stealthily, as if drawn by some invisible  force which she was powerless to withstand. It reminded me instantly  of an experiment I had shown many times to a form of boys learning the  elements of physics in a laboratory, in which a small magnet is made  to float on a cork in a bowl of water and small steel objects placed  on neighbouring pieces of cork are drawn up to the floating magnet by  magnetic force. It reminded me, too, of seeing in my little boy's bath  how a large celluloid floating duck would draw towards itself, by what  is called capillary attraction, smaller ducks, frogs, beetles, and  other animal folk, until the menagerie floated about as a unit,  oblivious of their natural antipathies and reminding us of the \"happy  families\" one sees in cages on the seashore. On the New York there was  shouting of orders, sailors running to and fro, paying out ropes and  putting mats over the side where it seemed likely we should collide;  the tug which had a few moments before cast off from the bows of the  Titanic came up around our stern and passed to the quay side of the  New York's stern, made fast to her and started to haul her back with  all the force her engines were capable of; but it did not seem that  the tug made much impression on the New York. Apart from the serious  nature of the accident, it made an irresistibly comic picture to see  the huge vessel drifting "]]]
