In arguing that CIPA will induce  public libraries to violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs  contend that given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's  conditions effectively require libraries to impose content-based  restrictions on their patrons' access to constitutionally  protected speech.  According to the plaintiffs, these content-  based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public  forum doctrine, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of  Va., 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995), and are therefore permissible only  if they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state  interest and no less restrictive alternatives would further that  interest, see Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997).   The  government responds that CIPA will not induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment, since it is possible for at least  some public libraries to constitutionally comply with CIPA's  conditions.  Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate  the First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be  facially invalidated only if it is impossible for any public  library to comply with its conditions without violating the First  Amendment.      Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try  the issues.  Pub. L. No. 106-554.  Following an intensive period  of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow public libraries  to know whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July  1, 2002, to receive subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court  conducted an eight-day trial at which we heard 20 witnesses, and  received numerous depositions, stipulations and documents.  The  principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently  available filtering software.  The plaintiffs adduced substantial  evidence not only that filtering programs bar access to a  substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly  constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but also that  these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal  Internet content while simultaneously allowing access to all  protected speech.  As our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs  demonstrated that thousands of Web pages containing protected  speech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filtering  programs, and these pages represent only a fraction of Web pages  wrongly blocked by the programs.  The plaintiffs' evidence  explained that the problems faced by the manufacturers and  vendors of filtering software are legion.  The Web is extremely  dynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every day  and the contents of existing Web pages changing very rapidly.  The category lists maintained by the blocking programs are  considered to be proprietary information, and hence are  unavailable to customers or the general public for review, so  that public libraries that select categories when implementing  filtering software do not really know what they are blocking.      There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from  extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in  great detail.  They center on the limitations on filtering  companies' ability to: (1) accurately collect Web pages that  potentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography); (2)  review and categorize Web pages that they have collected; and (3)  engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have  previously reviewed.  These failures spring from constraints on  the technology of automated classification systems, and the  limitations inherent in human review, including error,  misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail  infra at 58-74.  One failure of critical importance is that the  automated systems that filtering companies use to collect Web  pages for classification are able to search only text, not  images.  This is crippling to filtering companies' ability to  collect pages containing \"visual depictions\" that are obscene,  child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires.  As  will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the  Internet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, and  architecture, and given the state of the art of automated  classification systems, to develop a filter that neither  underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.      The government, while acknowledging that the filtering  software is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quite  effective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority of  the Web pages that meet filtering companies' category definitions  (e.g., pornography).  The government contends that no more is  required.  In its view, so long as the filtering software  selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages  proscribed by CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice  which suffices, under the applicable legal principles, to pass  constitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge.  Central to the government's position is the analogy it advances  between Internet filtering and the initial decision of a library  to determine which materials to purchase for its print  collection.  Public libraries have finite budgets and must make  choices as to whether to purchase, for example, books on  gardening or books on golf.  Such content-based decisions, even  the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis review and  not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny.  In the  government's view, the fact that the Internet reverses the  acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in effect,  purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore  pornography) it does not want, should not mean that it is  chargeable with censorship when it filters out offending  material.  The legal context in which this extensive factual record is  set is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines,  including the constitutional limitations on Congress's spending  clause power, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and  subsidiary to these issues, the First Amendment doctrines of  prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth.  There are a number  of potential entry points into the analysis, but the most logical  is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).  Dole outlines four  categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power  under the Spending Clause, but the only Dole condition disputed  here is the fourth and last, i.e., whether CIPA requires  libraries that receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts to violate  the constitutional rights of their patrons.  As will appear, the  question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny  applicable to a public library's content-based restrictions on  patrons' Internet access.  Whether such restrictions are subject  to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend, or only rational basis  review, as the government contends, depends on public forum  doctrine.      The government argues that, in providing Internet access,  public libraries do not create a public forum, since public  libraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakers from  availing themselves of the forum.  Accordingly, the government  contends that public libraries' restrictions on patrons' Internet  access are subject only to rational basis review.  Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict  speech on its own property, as in the case of restrictions on  Internet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and that  the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of  private speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's  decision is to restrict access to speech in that forum.  We agree  with the plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based  restrictions on their patrons' Internet access are subject to  strict scrutiny.  In providing even filtered Internet access,  public libraries create a public forum open to any speaker around  the world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on  a virtually unlimited number of topics.  Where the state provides  access to a \"vast democratic forum[],\" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S.  844, 868 (1997), open to any member of the public to speak on  subjects \"as diverse as human thought,\" id. at 870 (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision  selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose content the  state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions  risk distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has  facilitated.  Application of strict scrutiny finds further  support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of  Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a  manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets,  sidewalks, and parks, in which content-based restrictions are  always subject to strict scrutiny.      Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering  software is permissible only if it is narrowly tailored to  further a compelling government interest and no less restrictive  alternative would serve that interest.  We acknowledge that use  of filtering software furthers public libraries' legitimate  interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual depictions  of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  material harmful to minors.  Moreover, use of filters also helps  prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently  offensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet.      We are sympathetic to the position of the government,  believing that it would be desirable if there were a means to  ensure that public library patrons could share in the  informational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated from  materials that meet CIPA's definitions, that is, visual  depictions that are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5183"],[0,"The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (#2)"],[1,"hed, that  particular generalisation will, I submit, now go forward not as a  datum of my individual experience, but as the intellectual resultant  of two separate and distinct experiences.

A. E. W.  1913.        INTRODUCTION    Programme of this Treatise--Motives  from which Women Claim the  Suffrage--Types of Men who Support the Suffrage--John Stuart Mill.    The task which I undertake here is to show that the Woman's Suffrage  Movement has no real intellectual or moral sanction, and that there  are very weighty reasons why the suffrage should not be conceded to  woman.    I would propose to begin by analysing the mental attitude of those who  range themselves on the side of woman suffrage, and then to pass on to  deal with the principal arguments upon which the woman suffragist  relies.    The preponderating majority of the women who claim the suffrage do not  do so from motives of public interest or philanthropy.    They are influenced almost exclusively by two motives: resentment at  the suggestion that woman should be accounted by man as inherently his  inferior in certain important respects; and reprehension of a state of  society in which more money, more personal liberty (In reality only  more of the personal liberty which the possession of money confers),  more power, more public recognition and happier physiological  conditions fall to the share of man.    A cause which derives its driving force so little from philanthropy  and public interest and so much from offended _amour propre_ and  pretensions which are, as we shall see, unjustified, has in reality no  moral prestige.    For its intellectual prestige the movement depends entirely on the  fact that it has the advocacy of a certain number of distinguished  men.    It will not be amiss to examine that advocacy.    The \"intellectual\" whose name appears at the foot of woman's suffrage  petitions will, when you have him by himself, very often Make  confession:--\"Woman suffrage,\" he will tell you, \"is not the grave and  important cause which the ardent female suffragist deems it to be. Not  only will it not do any of the things which she imagines it is going  to do, but it will leave the world exactly where it is. Still--the  concession of votes to women is desirable from the point of view of  symmetry of classification; and it will soothe the ruffled feelings of  quite a number of very worthy women.\"    It may be laid down as a broad general rule that only two classes of  men have the cause of woman's suffrage really at heart.    The first is the crank who, as soon as he thinks he has discerned a  moral principle, immediately gets into the saddle, and then rides  hell-for-leather, reckless of all considerations of public expediency.    The second is that very curious type of man, who when it is suggested  in his hearing that the species woman is, measured by certain  intellectual and moral standards, the inferior of the species man,  solemnly draws himself up and asks, \"Are you, sir, aware that you are  insulting my wife?\"    To this, the type of man who feels every unfavourable criticism of  woman as a personal affront to himself, John Stuart Mill, had  affinities.    We find him writing a letter to the Home Secretary, informing him, in  relation to a Parliamentary Bill restricting the sale of arsenic to  male persons over twenty-one years, that it was a \"gross insult to  every woman, all women from highest to lowest being deemed unfit to  have poison in their possession, lest they shall commit murder.\"    We find him again, in a state of indignation with the English marriage  laws, preluding his nuptials with Mrs. Taylor by presenting that lady  with a formal charter; renouncing all authority over her, and  promising her security against all infringements of her liberty which  might proceed from _himself_.    To this lady he is always ascribing credit for his eminent  intellectual achievements. And lest his reader should opine that woman  stands somewhat in the shade with respect to her own intellectual  triumphs, Mill undertakes the explanation. \"Felicitous thoughts,\" he  tells us, \"occur by hundreds to every woman of intellect. But they  are mostly lost for want of a husband or friend . . . to estimate them  properly, and to bring them before the world; and even when they are  brought before it they generally appear as his ideas.\"    Not only did Mill see woman and all her works through an optical  medium which gave images like this; but there was upon his retina  a large blind area. By reason of this last it was inapprehensible  to him that there could be an objection to the sexes co-operating  indiscriminately in work. It was beyond his ken that the sex element  would under these conditions invade whole departments of life which  are now free from it. As he saw things, there was in point of fact a  risk of the human race dying out by reason of the inadequate  imperativeness of its sexual instincts.    Mill's unfaithfulness to the facts cannot, however, all be put down to  constitutional defects of vision. When he deals with woman he is no  longer scrupulously conscientious. We begin to have our suspicions of  his uprightness when we find him in his _Subjection of Women_ laying  it down as a fundamental postulate that the subjection of woman to man  is always morally indefensible. For no upright mind can fail to see  that the woman who lives in a condition of financial dependence upon  man has no moral claim to unrestricted liberty. The suspicion of  Mill's honesty which is thus awakened is confirmed by further critical  reading of his treatise. In that skilful tractate one comes across,  every here and there, a _suggestio falsi [suggestion of a falsehood],_  or a _suppressio veri [suppression of the truth],_ or a fallacious  analogy nebulously expressed, or a mendacious metaphor, or a passage  which is contrived to lead off attention from some weak point in the  feminist case.[1] Moreover, Mill was unmindful of the obligations of  intellectual morality when he allowed his stepdaughter, in connexion  with feminist questions, to draft letters [2] which went forward as  his own.    [1] _Vide [See]_ in this connexion the incidental references to Mill  on pp. 50, 81 footnote, and 139.  [2] Vide _Letters of John Stuart Mill,_ vol. ii, pp. 51, 79, 80, 100,  141, 157, 238, 239, 247, 288, and 349. There is yet another factor  which must be kept in mind in connexion with the writings of Mill. It  was the special characteristic of the man to set out to tackle concrete  problems and then to spend his strength upon abstractions.    In his _Political Economy_, where his proper subject matter was man  with his full equipment of impulses, Mill took as his theme an  abstraction: an _economic man_ who is actuated solely by the desire of  gain. He then worked out in great elaboration the course of conduct  which an aggregate of these puppets of his imagination would pursue.  Having persuaded    himself, after this, that he had in his possession a _vade mecum_  _[handbook]_ to the comprehension of human societies, he now took it  upon himself to expound the principles which govern and direct these.  Until such time as this procedure was unmasked, Mill's political  economy enjoyed an unquestioned authority.    Exactly the same plan was followed by Mill in handling the question of  woman's suffrage. Instead of dealing with woman as she is, and with  woman placed in a setting of actually subsisting conditions, Mill  takes as his theme a woman who is a creature of his imagination. This  woman is, _by assumption_, in mental endowments a replica of man. She  lives in a world which is, _by tacit assumption_, free from  complications of sex. And, if practical considerations had ever come  into the purview of Mill's mind, she would, _by tacit assumption_, be  paying her own way, and be making full personal and financial  contributions to the State. It is in connexion with this fictitious  woman that Mill sets himself to work out the benefits which women  would derive from co-partnership with men in the government of the  State, and those which such co-partnership would confer on the  community. Finally, practising again upon himself the same imposition  as in his _Political Economy_, this unpractical trafficker in  abstractions sets out to persuade his reader that he has, by dealing  with fictions of the mind, effectively grappled with the concrete  problem of woman's suffrage.    This, then, is the philosopher who gives intellectual prestige to the  Woman's Suffrage cause.    But is there not, let us in the end ask ourselves, here and there at  least, a man who is of real account in the world of affairs, and who  is--not simply a luke-warm Platonic friend or an opportunist  advocate--but an impassioned promoter of the woman's suffrage  movement? One knows quite well that there is. But then one suspects--one  perhaps discerns by \"the spirit sense\"--that this impassioned  promoter of woman's suffrage is, on the sequestered side of his life,  an idealistic dreamer: one for whom some woman's memory has become,  like Beatrice for Dante, a mystic religion.    We may now pass on to deal with the arguments by which the woman  suffragist has sought to establish her case.      PART I    ARGUMENTS"]]]
