She looked at the snake, and from its sullen flat head it looked  at her, obstinately. She gave a cry, and it released the frog and slid  angrily away.    That was Crockham. The spear of modern invention had not passed through  it, and it lay there secret, primitive, savage as when the Saxons first  came. And Egbert and she were caught there, caught out of the world.    He was not idle, nor was she. There were plenty of things to be done, the  house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone, cushions  and curtains to sew, the paths to make, the water to fetch and attend to,  and then the slope of the deep-soiled, neglected garden to level, to  terrace with little terraces and paths, and to fill with flowers. He  worked away, in his shirt-sleeves, worked all day intermittently doing  this thing and the other. And she, quiet and rich in herself, seeing him  stooping and labouring away by himself, would come to help him, to be  near him. He of course was an amateur--a born amateur. He worked so hard,  and did so little, and nothing he ever did would hold together for long.  If he terraced the garden, he held up the earth with a couple of long  narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind, and  would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil  slither all down again in a heap towards the stream-bed. But there you  are. He had not been brought up to come to grips with anything, and he  thought it would do. Nay, he did not think there was anything else except  little temporary contrivances possible, he who had such a passion for his  old enduring cottage, and for the old enduring things of the bygone  England. Curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold  over him, whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy.    Winifred could not criticize him. Town-bred, everything seemed to her  splendid, and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic. But  neither Egbert nor she yet realized the difference between work and  romance.    Godfrey Marshall, her father, was at first perfectly pleased with the  menage down at Crockham Cottage. He thought Egbert was wonderful, the  many things he accomplished, and he was gratified by the glow of physical  passion between the two young people. To the man who in London still  worked hard to keep steady his modest fortune, the thought of this young  couple digging away and loving one another down at Crockham Cottage,  buried deep among the commons and marshes, near the pale-showing bulk of  the downs, was like a chapter of living romance. And they drew the  sustenance for their fire of passion from him, from the old man. It was  he who fed their flame. He triumphed secretly in the thought. And it was  to her father that Winifred still turned, as the one source of all surety  and life and support. She loved Egbert with passion. But behind her was  the power of her father. It was the power of her father she referred to,  whenever she needed to refer. It never occurred to her to refer to  Egbert, if she were in difficulty or doubt. No, in all the _serious_  matters she depended on her father.    For Egbert had no intention of coming to grips with life. He had no  ambition whatsoever. He came from a decent family, from a pleasant  country home, from delightful surroundings. He should, of course, have  had a profession. He should have studied law or entered business in some  way. But no--that fatal three pounds a week would keep him from starving  as long as he lived, and he did not want to give himself into bondage. It  was not that he was idle. He was always doing something, in his  amateurish way. But he had no desire to give himself to the world, and  still less had he any desire to fight his way in the world. No, no, the  world wasn't worth it. He wanted to ignore it, to go his own way apart,  like a casual pilgrim down the forsaken sidetracks. He loved his wife,  his cottage and garden. He would make his life there, as a sort of  epicurean hermit. He loved the past, the old music and dances and customs  of old England. He would try and live in the spirit of these, not in the  spirit of the world of business.    But often Winifred's father called her to London: for he loved to have  his children round him. So Egbert and she must have a tiny flat in town,  and the young couple must transfer themselves from time to time from the  country to the city. In town Egbert had plenty of friends, of the same  ineffectual sort as himself, tampering with the arts, literature,  painting, sculpture, music. He was not bored.    Three pounds a week, however, would not pay for all this. Winifred's  father paid. He liked paying. He made her only a very small allowance,  but he often gave her ten pounds--or gave Egbert ten pounds. So they both  looked on the old man as the mainstay. Egbert didn't mind being  patronized and paid for. Only when he felt the family was a little _too_  condescending, on account of money, he began to get huffy.    Then of course children came: a lovely little blonde daughter with a head  of thistle-down. Everybody adored the child. It was the first exquisite  blonde thing that had come into the family, a little mite with the white,  slim, beautiful limbs of its father, and as it grew up the dancing,  dainty movement of a wild little daisy-spirit. No wonder the Marshalls  all loved the child: they called her Joyce. They themselves had their own  grace, but it was slow, rather heavy. They had everyone of them strong,  heavy limbs and darkish skins, and they were short in stature. And now  they had for one of their own this light little cowslip child. She was  like a little poem in herself.    But nevertheless, she brought a new difficulty. Winifred must have a  nurse for her. Yes, yes, there must be a nurse. It was the family decree.  Who was to pay for the nurse? The grandfather--seeing the father himself  earned no money. Yes, the grandfather would pay, as he had paid all the  lying-in expenses. There came a slight sense of money-strain. Egbert was  living on his father-in-law.    After the child was born, it was never quite the same between him and  Winifred. The difference was at first hardly perceptible. But it was  there. In the first place Winifred had a new centre of interest. She was  not going to adore her child. But she had what the modern mother so often  has in the place of spontaneous love: a profound sense of duty towards  her child. Winifred appreciated her darling little girl, and felt a deep  sense of duty towards her. Strange, that this sense of duty should go  deeper than the love for her husband. But so it was. And so it often is.  The responsibility of motherhood was the prime responsibility in  Winifred's heart: the responsibility of wifehood came a long way second.    Her child seemed to link her up again in a circuit with her own family.  Her father and mother, herself, and her child, that was the human trinity  for her. Her husband--? Yes, she loved him still. But that was like play.  She had an almost barbaric sense of duty and of family. Till she married,  her first human duty had been towards her father: he was the pillar, the  source of life, the everlasting support. Now another link was added to  the chain of duty: her father, herself, and her child.    Egbert was out of it. Without anything happening, he was gradually,  unconsciously excluded from the circle. His wife still loved him,  physically. But, but--he was _almost_ the unnecessary party in the  affair. He could not complain of Winifred. She still did her duty towards  him. She still had a physical passion for him, that physical passion on  which he had put all his life and soul. But--but--    It was for a long while an ever-recurring _but_. And then, after the  second child, another blonde, winsome touching little thing, not so proud  and flame-like as Joyce--after Annabel came, then Egbert began truly to  realize how it was. His wife still loved him. But--and now the but had  grown enormous--her physical love for him was of secondary importance to  her. It became ever less important. After all, she had had it, this  physical passion, for two years now. It was not this that one lived from.  No, no--something sterner, realer.    She began to resent her own passion for Egbert--just a little she began  to despise it. For after all there he was, he was charming, he was  lovable, he was terribly desirable. But--but--oh, the awful looming cloud  of that _but!_--he did not stand firm in the landscape of her life like a  tower of strength, like a great pillar of significance. No, he was like a  cat one has about the house, which will one day disappear and leave no  trace. He was like a flower in the garden, trembling in the wind of life,  and then gone, leaving nothing to show. As an adjunct, as an accessory,  he was perfect. Many a woman would have adored to have him about her all  her life, the most beautiful and desirable of all her possessions. But  Winifred belonged to another school.    The years went by, and instead of coming more to grips with life, he  relaxed more. He was of a subtle, sensitive, passionate nature. But he  simply _would_ not give himself to what Winifred called life, _Work_. No,  he would not go into the world and work for money. No, he just would not.  If Winifred liked to live beyond their small income--well, it was her  look-out.    And Winifred did not really want him to go out into the world to work for  money. Money became, alas, a word like a firebrand between them, setting  them both aflame with anger. But that is because we must talk in symbols.  Winifred did not really care about money. She did not care whether he  earned or did not earn anything. Only she knew she was dependent on her  father for three-fourths of the money spent for herself and her children,  that she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8952"],[0,"Scientific American, Volume 22, No. 1, January 1, 1870 (#2)"],[1,"its  first lesson in cleanliness, the liquid now rises through a tube to the  series of clarifiers on the second floor. They are heated by a chain of  steam pipes running along the bottom, and being filled, the juice slowly  simmers Much of the foreign substance rises in a scum to the surface  and is skimmed off by the sugar maker. It is further purified by the  addition of Thomaston or what is called sugar lime. At one half a peck  is considered sufficient for seven hundred and fifty gallons of juice,  but much depends upon the quantity of saccharine matter it contains.  Another set of pipes now permit the liquor to run into the evaporators,  in the boiling room below. These are also heated by circles of steam  pipes, and the liquid is first gently simmered, to enable any additional  foreign substance to rise to the surface and be skimmed off.    \"After that the steam is turned on fully, and the juice boils until  it reaches the solidity of twenty-five degrees, as measured by the  saccharometer. This point attained, more pipes conduct it to a series  of square iron tanks called filterers. Each is provided with a false  bottom, covered with thick woolen blankets, and through these the juice  slowly drips into an immense iron vessel called a sirup tank.    \"The process of cleaning has now been completed, and the sirup is pumped  into the covered vessel previously alluded to, called the vacuum pan.    \"This is also heated by layers of steam pipes, and here the liquor boils  until the process of crystallization is completed. This end achieved,  another conductor permits the substance to slowly descend to a large  square iron tank, called a strike-pan. The process of emptying the  vacuum pan is technically called a \"strike.\" We now find a reddish brown  substance, having somewhat the appearance of soft mortar.    \"Men are at hand with square wooden boxes, and while the sugar is still  warm, it is placed in rotary cylinders, protected on the inside by wire  guards, called centrifugals.    \"Placed on a horizontal, they revolve with a velocity which frequently  reaches 1200 a minute. The damp, dingy looking pile instantly spreads, a  broad circle of yellow is first visible on the inner rim of the machine,  and this slowly whitening finally becomes a shining ring of snowy sugar.  To effect this result requires the aid of nine steam boilers, three  steam engines, a vacuum pan, three large evaporators, five clarifiers,  five filters, an immense sirup tank, the juice box, mill, bagasse  furnace, and fifteen coolers.    \"With the engineers, sugar makers, firemen, and laborers, thirty-eight  persons are constantly on duty in this sugar-house.    \"Doubling this number, to give each the necessary rest, swells the  gathering to seventy-six souls, who, during the grinding season, find  employment at the sugar-house alone. This of course does not include the  laborers employed in gathering and bringing in the crop, and the  great number occupied in odd jobs and the extensive repairs which are  constantly going on.\"           *       *       *       *       *          Sticking, or Court Plaster.      This plaster is well known from its general use and its healing  properties. It is merely a kind of varnished silk, and its manufacture  is very easy.    Bruise a sufficient quantity of isinglass, and let it soak in a little  warm water for four-and-twenty hours; expose it to heat over the fire  till the greater part of the water is dissipated, and supply its place  by proof spirits of wine, which will combine with the isinglass.  Strain the whole through a piece of open linen, taking care that the  consistence of the mixture shall be such that, when cool, it may form a  trembling jelly.    Extend the piece of black silk, of which you propose making your  plaster, on a wooden frame, and fix it in that position by means of  tacks or pack-thread. Then apply the isinglass (after it has been  rendered liquid by a gentle heat) to the silk with a brush of fine hair  (badgers' is the best). As soon as this first coating is dried, which  will not be long, apply a second; and afterwards, if you wish the  article to be very superior, a third. When the whole is dry, cover it  with two or three coatings of the balsam of Peru.    This is the genuine court plaster. It is pliable, and never breaks,  which is far from being the case with many of the spurious articles  which are sold under that name. Indeed, this commodity is very  frequently adulterated. A kind of plaster, with a very thick and brittle  covering, is often sold for it. The manufacturers of this, instead of  isinglass, use common glue, which is much cheaper; and cover the whole  with spirit varnish, instead of balsam of Peru. This plaster cracks, and  has none of the balsamic smell by which the genuine court plaster is  distinguished. Another method of detecting the adulteration is to  moisten it with your tongue _on the side opposite to that which is  varnished_; and, if the plaster be genuine, it will adhere exceedingly  well. The adulterated plaster is too hard for this; it will not stick,  unless you moisten it on the varnished side.--_The Painter, Gilder, and  Varnisher's Companion_.           *       *       *       *       *          AN IMPROVED HOISTING PULLEY WANTED.      A gentleman of this city has sent us the accompanying diagram of an  improved hoisting pulley, for which he say she would be willing to pay  any reasonable price provided he knew where to obtain it--the wheel, not  the price. It is a pulley within a pulley, the friction of the outer one  upon the inner one--the latter being held by a ratchet and pawl-acting  as a brake in lowering weights, while both would turn together in  elevating weights. The idea is rather an ingenious one, but we are  confident our inventors can attain a like object by simpler means.

The action of the  machine is based on the principle of producing cold by the expansion of  atmospheric air, which is accomplished by means of mechanical power. The  machines require no chemicals, nothing being used in them but water and  atmospheric air. They may be wrought by steam, water, or wind, and they  produce from 100 to 1,000 lbs. of ice per hour, according to size, at a  cost of from 2d. to 5d. per 100 lbs., this difference resulting from the  varying prices of fuel and the mode of working chosen. One of their uses  is to cool rooms, cellars, theaters, hospitals, compartments of ships,  etc.--_Builder_.           *       *       *       *       *          FERDINAND DE LESSEPS--CHIEF PROMOTER OF THE SUEZ CANAL.    [From the Phrenological Journal.]      The scheme of re-opening the canal of the Pharaohs between the  Mediterranean and Red seas, and thus connecting by a short cut across  the Isthmus of Suez the commerce of Europe and Asia, though long  entertained by the first Napoleon, may fairly be claimed for M. de  Lesseps. His attention was doubtless first drawn to it by reading the  memorable report of M. la Pere, who was employed by Bonaparte to make  a survey in 1798. The credit of designing and executing the great work  belongs alike to him. With the general plan, progress, and purpose of  the Canal, the American reader has, during the past few months, been  made tolerably familiar.    He is the son of Jean Baptiste Barthelemi, Baron de Lesseps, who was  born at Cette, a French port on the Mediterranean, in 1765. Jean  Baptiste was for five years French Vice-Consul at St. Petersburg. In  1785 he accompanied La Perouse on a voyage to Kamtchatka, whence he  brought by land the papers containing a description of the expedition.  In 1788 he was Consul at Kronstadt and St. Petersburg. From St.  Petersburg he was called, in 1812, by the Emperor Napoleon, to Moscow,  as _intendant_. From the latter city, in 1814, he proceeded to Lisbon,  and was stationed there as Consul until 1823. He died at Paris, May 6,  1834.    Ferdinand, the subject of this sketch, was born at Versailles in 1805,  and is consequently in his sixty-fourth year, though his appearance is  that of a man little past the meridian of life. Early in life he evinced  peculiar aptitude for the diplomatic career in which he has since  distinguished himself--a career as varied and romantic as it is  brilliant. In 1825 he was appointed _attache_ to the French Consulate at  Lisbon. Two years later found him engaged in the Commercial Department  of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the latter part of 1828  he was _attache_ to the Consul-General at Tunis; and in 1831 he was  dispatched by his Government as Consul to Alexandria. Hard work and  rapid promotion for _le jeune diplomat!_ But the most eventful period of  his long and wonderfully active career lay yet before him.    Seven years subsequent to his appointment at Alexandria, and  consequently when he was in his thirty-fifth year, he was sent as  Consul to Rotterdam. From Rotterdam he proceeded to Malaga in 1839, to  negotiate in behalf of French commerce with the Spanish Government. In  the latter part of the same year he was transferred to the Consulate  at Barcelona, where during the two subsequent years he was especially  active, and signally distinguished himself against the reign of  Espartero. In 1844 we again find him in Alexandria, whither he was sent  to take the place of Lavalette. But the time for the development of his  great project had not yet come. He did not long remain in the Egyptian  capital. Returning to his former position in Barcelona he was witness  to some of the scenes of the revolution of February. In 1848 he was  appointed French Minister at the court of Madrid. Remaining in the  Spanish capital about a year, he returned to Paris immediately after the  revolution of '48, and in May of the following year"]]]
