[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#2)"],[1," sense-data are directly properties of the table. Thus a problem  arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing  there is such a thing.    The real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical object'. Thus  we have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects.  The collection of all physical objects is called 'matter'. Thus our two  questions may be re-stated as follows: (1) Is there any such thing as  matter? (2) If so, what is its nature?    The philosopher who first brought prominently forward the reasons  for regarding the immediate objects of our senses as not existing  independently of us was Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753). His _Three  Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and  Atheists_, undertake to prove that there is no such thing as matter at  all, and that the world consists of nothing but minds and their ideas.  Hylas has hitherto believed in matter, but he is no match for Philonous,  who mercilessly drives him into contradictions and paradoxes, and makes  his own denial of matter seem, in the end, as if it were almost common  sense. The arguments employed are of very different value: some are  important and sound, others are confused or quibbling. But Berkeley  retains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is  capable of being denied without absurdity, and that if there are any  things that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate  objects of our sensations.    There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter  exists, and it is important to keep them clear. We commonly mean by  'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind', something which we think  of as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought  or consciousness. It is chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies  matter; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we  commonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs  of the existence of _something_ independent of us, but he does deny  that this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas  entertained by some mind. He admits that there must be something which  continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that  what we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing  in something which persists even when we are not seeing it. But he  thinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from  what we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it  must be independent of _our_ seeing. He is thus led to regard the 'real'  table as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required  permanence and independence of ourselves, without being--as matter would  otherwise be--something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only  infer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.    Other philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, although the  table does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does  depend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by  _some_ mind--not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole  collective mind of the universe. This they hold, as Berkeley does,  chiefly because they think there can be nothing real--or at any rate  nothing known to be real except minds and their thoughts and feelings.  We might state the argument by which they support their view in some  such way as this: 'Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of  the person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except  ideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is  inconceivable cannot exist.'    Such an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious; and of course those who  advance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. But whether valid or  not, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another;  and very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, have held that there is  nothing real except minds and their ideas. Such philosophers are called  'idealists'. When they come to explaining matter, they either say, like  Berkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas,  or they say, like Leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is  really a collection of more or less rudimentary minds.    But these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind,  nevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be remembered that  we asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If  so, what sort of object can it be? Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit  that there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the  mind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. Thus both of them  answer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the  views of ordinary mortals in their answer to our second question. In  fact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real  table: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data--colour,  shape, smoothness, etc.--may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is  a sign of something existing independently of us, something differing,  perhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as  causing those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the  real table.    Now obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed--the view  that there _is_ a real table, whatever its nature may be--is vitally  important, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are  for accepting this view before we go on to the further question as  to the nature of the real table. Our next chapter, therefore, will be  concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at  all.    Before we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it  is that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if we take any  common object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses,  what the senses _immediately_ tell us is not the truth about the object  as it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data  which, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and  the object. Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance',  which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality' behind. But if the  reality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there  is any reality at all? And if so, have we any means of finding out what  it is like?    Such questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even  the strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table,  which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a  problem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing we know about it  is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we  have the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a  community of souls: Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God;  sober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection  of electric charges in violent motion.    Among these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there  is no table at all. Philosophy, if it cannot _answer_ so many questions  as we could wish, has at least the power of _asking_ questions which  increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder  lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.        CHAPTER II. THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER    In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all,  there is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain  intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is  the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very  prolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if  we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot  be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and  therefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds  for believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing  their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of  objects, we shall be left alone in a desert--it may be that the whole  outer world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist. This is an  uncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved to  be false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true.  In this chapter we have to see why this is the case.    Before we embark upon doubtful matters, let us try to find some more  or less fixed point from which to start. Although we are doubting the  physical existence of the table, we are not doubting the existence  of the sense-data which made us think there was a table; we are not  doubting that, while we look, a certain colour and shape appear to us,  and while we press, a certain sensation of hardness is experienced by  us. All this, which is psychological, we are not calling in question.  In fact, whatever else may be doubtful, some at least of our immediate  experiences seem absolutely certain.    Descartes (1596-1650), the founder of modern philosophy, invented a  method which may still be used with profit--the method of systematic  doubt. He determined that he would believe nothing which he did not see  quite clearly and distinctly to be true. Whatever he could bring himself  to doubt, he would doubt, until he saw reason for not doubting it.  By applying this method he gradually became convinced that the only  existence of which he could be _quite_ certain was his own. He imagined  a deceitful demon, who presented unreal things to his senses in a  perpetual phantasmagoria; it might be very improbable that such a demon  existed, but still it was possible, and therefore doubt concerning  things perceived by the senses was possible.    But doubt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#2)"],[1," that by so doing he was to turn the whole  current of my existence into a new channel, and to alter me to myself  almost past recognition.    Yet so it was.  If I had not dived for Professor Pesca when he lay  under water on his shingle bed, I should in all human probability never  have been connected with the story which these pages will relate--I  should never, perhaps, have heard even the name of the woman who has  lived in all my thoughts, who has possessed herself of all my energies,  who has become the one guiding influence that now directs the purpose  of my life.        III    Pesca's face and manner, on the evening when we confronted each other  at my mother's gate, were more than sufficient to inform me that  something extraordinary had happened.  It was quite useless, however,  to ask him for an immediate explanation.  I could only conjecture,  while he was dragging me in by both hands, that (knowing my habits) he  had come to the cottage to make sure of meeting me that night, and that  he had some news to tell of an unusually agreeable kind.    We both bounced into the parlour in a highly abrupt and undignified  manner.  My mother sat by the open window laughing and fanning herself.  Pesca was one of her especial favourites and his wildest eccentricities  were always pardonable in her eyes.  Poor dear soul! from the first  moment when she found out that the little Professor was deeply and  gratefully attached to her son, she opened her heart to him  unreservedly, and took all his puzzling foreign peculiarities for  granted, without so much as attempting to understand any one of them.    My sister Sarah, with all the advantages of youth, was, strangely  enough, less pliable.  She did full justice to Pesca's excellent  qualities of heart; but she could not accept him implicitly, as my  mother accepted him, for my sake.  Her insular notions of propriety  rose in perpetual revolt against Pesca's constitutional contempt for  appearances; and she was always more or less undisguisedly astonished  at her mother's familiarity with the eccentric little foreigner.  I  have observed, not only in my sister's case, but in the instances of  others, that we of the young generation are nothing like so hearty and  so impulsive as some of our elders.  I constantly see old people  flushed and excited by the prospect of some anticipated pleasure which  altogether fails to ruffle the tranquillity of their serene  grandchildren.  Are we, I wonder, quite such genuine boys and girls now  as our seniors were in their time? Has the great advance in education  taken rather too long a stride; and are we in these modern days, just  the least trifle in the world too well brought up?    Without attempting to answer those questions decisively, I may at least  record that I never saw my mother and my sister together in Pesca's  society, without finding my mother much the younger woman of the two.  On this occasion, for example, while the old lady was laughing heartily  over the boyish manner in which we tumbled into the parlour, Sarah was  perturbedly picking up the broken pieces of a teacup, which the  Professor had knocked off the table in his precipitate advance to meet  me at the door.    \"I don't know what would have happened, Walter,\" said my mother, \"if  you had delayed much longer.  Pesca has been half mad with impatience,  and I have been half mad with curiosity.  The Professor has brought  some wonderful news with him, in which he says you are concerned; and  he has cruelly refused to give us the smallest hint of it till his  friend Walter appeared.\"    \"Very provoking: it spoils the Set,\" murmured Sarah to herself,  mournfully absorbed over the ruins of the broken cup.    While these words were being spoken, Pesca, happily and fussily  unconscious of the irreparable wrong which the crockery had suffered at  his hands, was dragging a large arm-chair to the opposite end of the  room, so as to command us all three, in the character of a public  speaker addressing an audience.  Having turned the chair with its back  towards us, he jumped into it on his knees, and excitedly addressed his  small congregation of three from an impromptu pulpit.    \"Now, my good dears,\" began Pesca (who always said \"good dears\" when he  meant \"worthy friends\"), \"listen to me.  The time has come--I recite my  good news--I speak at last.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" said my mother, humouring the joke.    \"The next thing he will break, mamma,\" whispered Sarah, \"will be the  back of the best arm-chair.\"    \"I go back into my life, and I address myself to the noblest of created  beings,\" continued Pesca, vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self  over the top rail of the chair.  \"Who found me dead at the bottom of  the sea (through Cramp); and who pulled me up to the top; and what did  I say when I got into my own life and my own clothes again?\"    \"Much more than was at all necessary,\" I answered as doggedly as  possible; for the least encouragement in connection with this subject  invariably let loose the Professor's emotions in a flood of tears.    \"I said,\" persisted Pesca, \"that my life belonged to my dear friend,  Walter, for the rest of my days--and so it does.  I said that I should  never be happy again till I had found the opportunity of doing a good  Something for Walter--and I have never been contented with myself till  this most blessed day.  Now,\" cried the enthusiastic little man at the  top of his voice, \"the overflowing happiness bursts out of me at every  pore of my skin, like a perspiration; for on my faith, and soul, and  honour, the something is done at last, and the only word to say now  is--Right-all-right!\"    It may be necessary to explain here that Pesca prided himself on being  a perfect Englishman in his language, as well as in his dress, manners,  and amusements.  Having picked up a few of our most familiar colloquial  expressions, he scattered them about over his conversation whenever  they happened to occur to him, turning them, in his high relish for  their sound and his general ignorance of their sense, into compound  words and repetitions of his own, and always running them into each  other, as if they consisted of one long syllable.    \"Among the fine London Houses where I teach the language of my native  country,\" said the Professor, rushing into his long-deferred  explanation without another word of preface, \"there is one, mighty  fine, in the big place called Portland.  You all know where that is?  Yes, yes--course-of-course.  The fine house, my good dears, has got  inside it a fine family.  A Mamma, fair and fat; three young Misses,  fair and fat; two young Misters, fair and fat; and a Papa, the fairest  and the fattest of all, who is a mighty merchant, up to his eyes in  gold--a fine man once, but seeing that he has got a naked head and two  chins, fine no longer at the present time.  Now mind! I teach the  sublime Dante to the young Misses, and ah!--my-soul-bless-my-soul!--it  is not in human language to say how the sublime Dante puzzles the  pretty heads of all three! No matter--all in good time--and the more  lessons the better for me.  Now mind! Imagine to yourselves that I am  teaching the young Misses to-day, as usual.  We are all four of us down  together in the Hell of Dante.  At the Seventh Circle--but no matter  for that: all the Circles are alike to the three young Misses, fair and  fat,--at the Seventh Circle, nevertheless, my pupils are sticking fast;  and I, to set them going again, recite, explain, and blow myself up  red-hot with useless enthusiasm, when--a creak of boots in the passage  outside, and in comes the golden Papa, the mighty merchant with the  naked head and the two chins.--Ha! my good dears, I am closer than you  think for to the business, now. Have you been patient so far? or have  you said to yourselves, 'Deuce-what-the-deuce! Pesca is long-winded  to-night?'\"    We declared that we were deeply interested.  The Professor went on:    \"In his hand, the golden Papa has a letter; and after he has made his  excuse for disturbing us in our Infernal Region with the common mortal  Business of the house, he addresses himself to the three young Misses,  and begins, as you English begin everything in this blessed world that  you have to say, with a great O.  'O, my dears,' says the mighty  merchant, 'I have got here a letter from my friend, Mr.----'(the name  has slipped out of my mind; but no matter; we shall come back to that;  yes, yes--right-all-right). So the Papa says, 'I have got a letter from  my friend, the Mister; and he wants a recommend from me, of a  drawing-master, to go down to his house in the country.'  My-soul-bless-my-soul! when I heard the golden Papa say those words, if  I had been big enough to reach up to him, I should have put my arms  round his neck, and pressed him to my bosom in a long and grateful hug!  As it was, I only bounced upon my chair.  My seat was on thorns, and my  soul was on fire to speak but I held my tongue, and let Papa go on.  'Perhaps you know,' says this good man of money, twiddling his friend's  letter this way and that, in his golden fingers and thumbs, 'perhaps  you know, my dears, of a drawing-master that I can recommend?'  The  three young Misses all look at each other, and then say (with the  indispensable great O to begin) \"O, dear no, Papa! But here is Mr.  Pesca'  At the mention of myself I can hold no longer--the thought of  you, my good dears, mounts like blood to my head--I start from my seat,  as if a spike had grown up from the ground through the bottom of my  chair--I address myself to the mighty merchant, and I say (English  phrase) 'Dear sir, I have the man! The first and foremost  drawing-master of the world! Recommend him by the post to-night, and  send him off, bag and baggage (English phrase again--ha!), send him  off, bag and baggage, by the train to-morrow!'  'Stop, stop,' says  Papa; 'is he a foreigner, or an Englishman?'  'English "]]]
