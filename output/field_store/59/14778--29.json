In 1747 Leopold Mozart married Anna Maria Pertlin, a foster-child of the  Convent of St. Gilgen. The fruits of this marriage were seven children,  two of whom alone survived,--Maria Anna, (the fourth), called Nannerl,  born in 1751; and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus Johannes Chrysostomus.  The daughter at a very early age displayed a most remarkable talent  for music, and when her father began to give her instructions in it, an  inborn and passionate love of this art was soon evident in her little  brother of three years old, who at once gave tokens of a degree of  genius far surpassing all experience, and really bordering on the  marvellous. In his fourth year he could play all sorts of little pieces  on the piano. He only required half an hour to learn a minuet, and one  hour for a longer movement; and in his fifth year he actually composed  some pretty short pieces, several of which are still extant.    [Footnote: The Grand Duchess Helene Paulowna, a few weeks ago, made a  present to the Mozarteum of the music-book from which Mozart learned  music, and in which he wrote down his first compositions.]    The wonderful acquirements of both these children, to which Wolfgang  soon added skilful playing on the violin and organ, induced their father  to travel with them. In January, 1702, when the boy was just six  years old, they went first to Munich, and in the autumn to Vienna, the  children everywhere on their journey exciting the greatest sensation,  and being handsomely remunerated. Leopold Mozart, therefore, soon  afterwards resolved to undertake a longer journey, accompanied by his  whole family. This lasted more than three years, extending from the  smaller towns in West Germany to Paris and London, while they visited,  on their way back, Holland, France, and Switzerland. The careful musical  instruction which the father perseveringly bestowed on his son, went  hand in hand with the most admirable education, and the boy was soon as  universally beloved for his amiable disposition and natural simplicity  and candor, as admired for his rare gifts and acquirements.    After nearly a year passed at home in unremitting musical instruction,  and practice of various instruments as well as composition, the father  once more set off with all his family to Vienna,--on this occasion with  a view to Wolfgang paving the way to Italy by the composition of an  opera, (Italy, at that time, being the Eldorado of music.) He succeeded  in procuring the scrittura of an opera buffa, \"La Finta semplice;\"  but, when finished, although the Emperor himself had intrusted the  composition to the boy, the cabals of envious singers effectually  prevented its being performed. But a German operetta which the lad of  twelve also wrote at that time, \"Bastien und Bastienne,\" was given in  private, at the summer residence of the Mesmer family, in the suburb  called Landstrasse. The father, too, had some compensation by the  Emperor commissioning his son to compose a solemn mass for the  consecration of the new Waisenhaus church, which Wolfgang himself  directed with the conductor's baton, in presence of the Imperial Family,  on the 7th December, 1768.    Immediately on their return home, the young virtuoso was appointed  archiepiscopal Concertmeister. He passed almost the whole of the year  1769 in Salzburg, chiefly engaged in the composition of masses. We also  see him at that time eagerly occupied in improving his knowledge of  Latin, although two years previously he had composed a comedy in that  language,--\"Apollo et Hyacinthus.\" From this study proceeds the first  letter which is still extant from his hand:--        1.    Salzburg, 1769.    MY DEAR YOUNG LADY,--    I beg you will pardon the liberty I take in plaguing you with these few  lines, but as you said yesterday that there was nothing you could not  understand in Latin, and I might write what I chose in that language, I  could not resist the bold impulse to write you a few Latin lines. When  you have deciphered these, be so good as to send me the answer by one of  Hagenauer's servants, for my messenger cannot wait; remember, you must  answer this by a letter.    [Footnote: By a messenger of the Hagenauer family, in whose house,  opposite the inn of \"Den drei Allurten,\" Mozart was born, and with whom  his family were on the most intimate terms.]    \"Cuperem scire, de qua causa, a quam plurimis adolescentibus ottium  usque adeo oestimetur, ut ipsi se nec verbis, nec verberibus ad hoc  sinant abduci.\"    [Footnote: \"I should like to know the reason why indolence is so highly  prized by very many young men, that neither by words nor blows will they  suffer themselves to be roused from it.\"]    WOLFGANG MOZART.        The father's plan to go to Italy, there to lay the foundation of a  European reputation for his son, was realized in the beginning of  December, 1769, and during the journey, the boy, who was at that time  just entering his fifteenth year, subjoined to his father's reports  scraps of his own writing, in which, in true boyish fashion, he had  recourse to all kinds of languages and witticisms, but always exhibiting  in his opinions on music the closest observation, the gravest thought,  and the most acute judgment.        2.    Verona, Jan. 1770.    MY VERY DEAREST SISTER,--    I have at last got a letter a span long after hoping so much for an  answer that I lost patience; and I had good cause to do so before  receiving yours at last. The German blockhead having said his say, now  the Italian one begins. Lei e piu franca nella lingua italiana di quel  che mi ho immaginato. Lei mi dica la cagione perche lei non fu nella  commedia che hanno giocata i Cavalieri. Adesso sentiamo sempre una opera  titolata Il Ruggiero. Oronte, il padre di Bradamante, e un principe (il  Signor Afferi) bravo cantante, un baritono, [Footnote: \"You are more  versed in the Italian language than I believed. Tell me why you were not  one of the actors in the comedy performed by the Cavaliers. We are now  hearing an opera called 'Il Ruggiero.' Oronte, the father of Bradamante,  is a Prince (acted by Afferi, a good singer, a baritone).\"] but very  affected when he speaks out a falsetto, but not quite so much so as  Tibaldi in Vienna. Bradamante innamorata di Ruggiero (ma [Footnote:  \"Bradamante is enamored of Ruggiero, but\"]--she is to marry Leone, but  will not) fa una povera Baronessa, che ha avuto una gran disgrazia, ma  non so la quale; recita [Footnote: \"Pretends to be a poor Baroness who  has met with some great misfortune, but what it is I don't know, she  performs\"] under an assumed name, but the name I forget; ha una voce  passabile, e la statura non sarebbe male, ma distuona come il diavolo.  Ruggiero, un ricco principe innamorato di Bradamante, e un musico; canta  un poco Manzuolisch [Footnote: Manzuoli was a celebrated soprano, from  whom Mozart had lessons in singing when in London.] ed ha una bellissima  voce forte ed e gia vecchio; ha 55 anni, ed ha una [Footnote: \"She has  a tolerable voice, and her appearance is in her favor, but she sings out  of tune like a devil Ruggiero, a rich Prince enamored of Bradamante, is  a musico, and sings rather in Manzuoli's style, and has a fine powerful  voice, though quite old; he is fifty-five, and has a\"] flexible voice.  Leone is to marry Bradamante--richississimo e, [Footnote: \"Immensely  rich.\"] but whether he is rich off the stage I can't say.

Irene fa una sorella di Lolli, del gran violinista  che habbiamo sentito a Vienna, a una [Footnote: \"Afferi's wife has a  most beautiful voice, but sings so softly on the stage that you really  hear nothing at all. A sister of Lolli, the great violinist whom we  heard at Vienna, acts Irene; she has a\"] very harsh voce, e canta sempre  [Footnote: \"Voice, and always sings\"] a quaver too tardi o troppo a  buon' ora. Granno fa un signore, che non so come si chiame; e la prima  volta che lui recita. [Footnote: \"Slow or too fast. Ganno is acted by  a gentleman whose name I never heard. It is his first appearance on the  stage.\"] There is a ballet between each act. We have a good dancer here  called Roessler. He is a German, and dances right well. The very last  time we were at the opera (but not, I hope, the very last time we ever  shall be there) we got M. Roessler to come up to our palco, (for M.  Carlotti gives us his box, of which we have the key,) and conversed with  him. Apropos, every one is now in maschera, and one great convenience  is, that if you fasten your mask on your hat you have the privilege  of not taking off your hat when any one speaks to you; and you never  address them by name, but always as \"Servitore umilissimo, Signora  Maschera.\" Cospetto di Bacco! that is fun! The most strange of all is  that we go to bed at half-past seven! Se lei indovinasse questo, io diro  certamente che lei sia la madre di tutti gli indovini.

I REJOICE in my heart that you were so well amused at the sledging  party you write to me about, and I wish you a thousand opportunities of  pleasure, so that you may pass your life merrily. But one thing vexes  me, which is, that you allowed Herr von Molk [an admirer of this pretty  young girl of eighteen] to sigh and sentimentalize, and that you did not  go with him in his sledge, that he might have upset you.

Nowadays--\"    \"You forget that Mr. Pemberton Bryce is what most people would call a  very pushing young man,\" said Mary. \"If he doesn't get what he wants in  this world, it won't be for not asking for it. But--if you must speak  to him--and I really think you must!--will you tell him that he is  not going to get--me? Perhaps he'll take it finally from you--as my  guardian.\"    \"I don't know if parents and guardians count for much in these  degenerate days,\" said Ransford. \"But--I won't have him annoying you.  And--I suppose it has come to annoyance?\"    \"It's very annoying to be asked three times by a man whom you've told  flatly, once for all, that you don't want him, at any time, ever!\" she  answered. \"It's--irritating!\"    \"All right,\" said Ransford quietly. \"I'll speak to him. There's going to  be no annoyance for you under this roof.\"    The girl gave him a quick glance, and Ransford turned away from her and  picked up his letters.    \"Thank you,\" she said. \"But--there's no need to tell me that, because I  know it already. Now I wonder if you'll tell me something more?\"    Ransford turned back with a sudden apprehension.    \"Well?\" he asked brusquely. \"What?\"    \"When are you going to tell me all about--Dick and myself?\" she asked.  \"You promised that you would, you know, some day. And--a whole year's  gone by since then. And--Dick's seventeen! He won't be satisfied  always--just to know no more than that our father and mother died when  we were very little, and that you've been guardian--and all that you  have been!--to us. Will he, now?\"    Ransford laid down his letters again, and thrusting his hands in his  pockets, squared his shoulders against the mantelpiece. \"Don't you think  you might wait until you're twenty-one?\" he asked.    \"Why?\" she said, with a laugh. \"I'm just twenty--do you really think I  shall be any wiser in twelve months? Of course I shan't!\"    \"You don't know that,\" he replied. \"You may be--a great deal wiser.\"    \"But what has that got to do with it?\" she persisted. \"Is there any  reason why I shouldn't be told--everything?\"    She was looking at him with a certain amount of demand--and Ransford,  who had always known that some moment of this sort must inevitably come,  felt that she was not going to be put off with ordinary excuses. He  hesitated--and she went on speaking.    \"You know,\" she continued, almost pleadingly. \"We don't know  anything--at all. I never have known, and until lately Dick has been too  young to care--\"    \"Has he begun asking questions?\" demanded Ransford hastily.    \"Once or twice, lately--yes,\" replied Mary. \"It's only natural.\" She  laughed a little--a forced laugh. \"They say,\" she went on, \"that  it doesn't matter, nowadays, if you can't tell who your grandfather  was--but, just think, we don't know who our father was--except that his  name was John Bewery. That doesn't convey much.\"    \"You know more,\" said Ransford. \"I told you--always have told you--that  he was an early friend of mine, a man of business, who, with your  mother, died young, and I, as their friend, became guardian to you and  Dick. Is--is there anything much more that I could tell?\"    \"There's something I should very much like to know--personally,\" she  answered, after a pause which lasted so long that Ransford began to feel  uncomfortable under it. \"Don't be angry--or hurt--if I tell you plainly  what it is. I'm quite sure it's never even occurred to Dick--but I'm  three years ahead of him. It's this--have we been dependent on you?\"    Ransford's face flushed and he turned deliberately to the window, and  for a moment stood staring out on his garden and the glimpses of the  Cathedral. And just as deliberately as he had turned away, he turned  back.    \"No!\" he said. \"Since you ask me, I'll tell you that. You've both got  money--due to you when you're of age. It--it's in my hands. Not a  great lot--but sufficient to--to cover all your expenses.  Education--everything. When you're twenty-one, I'll hand over  yours--when Dick's twenty-one, his. Perhaps I ought to have told you  all that before, but--I didn't think it necessary. I--I dare say I've a  tendency to let things slide.\"    \"You've never let things slide about us,\" she replied quickly, with  a sudden glance which made him turn away again. \"And I only wanted to  know--because I'd got an idea that--well, that we were owing everything  to you.\"    \"Not from me!\" he exclaimed.    \"No--that would never be!\" she said. \"But--don't you understand?  I--wanted to know--something. Thank you. I won't ask more now.\"    \"I've always meant to tell you--a good deal,\" remarked Ransford, after  another pause. \"You see, I can scarcely--yet--realize that you're both  growing up! You were at school a year ago. And Dick is still very young.  Are--are you more satisfied now?\" he went on anxiously. \"If not--\"    \"I'm quite satisfied,\" she answered. \"Perhaps--some day--you'll tell me  more about our father and mother?--but never mind even that now. You're  sure you haven't minded my asking--what I have asked?\"    \"Of course not--of course not!\" he said hastily. \"I ought to have  remembered. And--but we'll talk again. I must get into the surgery--and  have a word with Bryce, too.\"    \"If you could only make him see reason and promise not to offend again,\"  she said. \"Wouldn't that solve the difficulty?\"    Ransford shook his head and made no answer. He picked up his letters  again and went out, and down a long stone-walled passage which led to  his surgery at the side of the house. He was alone there when he had  shut the door--and he relieved his feelings with a deep groan.    \"Heaven help me if the lad ever insists on the real truth and on having  proofs and facts given to him!\" he muttered. \"I shouldn't mind telling  her, when she's a bit older--but he wouldn't understand as she would.  Anyway, thank God I can keep up the pleasant fiction about the money  without her ever knowing that I told her a deliberate lie just now.  But--what's in the future? Here's one man to be dismissed already, and  there'll be others, and one of them will be the favoured man. That man  will have to be told! And--so will she, then. And--my God! she doesn't  see, and mustn't see, that I'm madly in love with her myself! She's no  idea of it--and she shan't have; I must--must continue to be--only the  guardian!\"    He laughed a little cynically as he laid his letters down on his  desk and proceeded to open them--in which occupation he was presently  interrupted by the opening of the side-door and the entrance of Mr.  Pemberton Bryce.          CHAPTER II. MAKING AN ENEMY      It was characteristic of Pemberton Bryce that he always walked into a  room as if its occupant were asleep and he was afraid of waking him.  He had a gentle step which was soft without being stealthy, and quiet  movements which brought him suddenly to anybody's side before his  presence was noticed. He was by Ransford's desk ere Ransford knew he was  in the surgery--and Ransford's sudden realization of his presence  roused a certain feeling of irritation in his mind, which he instantly  endeavoured to suppress--it was no use getting cross with a man of whom  you were about to rid yourself, he said to himself. And for the moment,  after replying to his assistant's greeting--a greeting as quiet as his  entrance--he went on reading his letters, and Bryce turned off to that  part of the surgery in which the drugs were kept, and busied himself  in making up some prescription. Ten minutes went by in silence; then  Ransford pushed his correspondence aside, laid a paper-weight on it, and  twisting his chair round, looked at the man to whom he was going to say  some unpleasant things. Within himself he was revolving a question--how  would Bryce take it?    He had never liked this assistant of his, although he had then had him  in employment for nearly two years. There was something about Pemberton  Bryce which he did not understand and could not fathom. He had come to  him with excellent testimonials and good recommendations; he was well up  to his work, successful with patients, thoroughly capable as a  general practitioner--there was no fault to be found with him on  any professional grounds. But to Ransford his personality was  objectionable--why, he was not quite sure. Outwardly, Bryce was rather  more than presentable--a tall, good-looking man of twenty-eight or  thirty, whom some people--women especially--would call handsome; he was  the sort of young man who knows the value of good clothes and a smart  appearance, and his professional manner was all that could be desired.  But Ransford could not help distinguishing between Bryce the doctor  and Bryce the man--and Bryce the man he did not like. Outside the  professional part of him, Bryce seemed to him to be undoubtedly deep,  sly, cunning--he conveyed the impression of being one of those men whose  ears are always on the stretch, who take everything in and give little  out. There was a curious air of watchfulness and of secrecy about him  in private matters which was as repellent--to Ransford's thinking--as  it was hard to explain. Anyway, in private affairs, he did not like his  assistant, and he liked him less than ever as he glanced at him on this  particular occasion.    \"I want a word with you,\" he said curtly. \"I'd better say it now.\"    Bryce, who was slowly pouring some liquid from one bottle into another,  looked quietly across the room and did not interrupt himself in his  work. Ransford knew that he must have recognized a certain significance  in the words just addressed to him--but he showed no outward "]]]
