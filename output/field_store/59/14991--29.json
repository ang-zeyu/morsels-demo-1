It does one's heart good to see the  thirsty oxen rush into a pool of delicious rain-water, as this was. In  they dash until the water is deep enough to be nearly level with their  throat, and then they stand drawing slowly in the long, refreshing  mouthfuls, until their formerly collapsed sides distend as if they would  burst. So much do they imbibe, that a sudden jerk, when they come out on  the bank, makes some of the water run out again from their mouths; but,  as they have been days without food too, they very soon commence to  graze, and of grass there is always abundance every where. This pool was  called Mathuluani; and thankful we were to have obtained so welcome a  supply of water.    After giving the cattle a rest at this spot, we proceeded down the dry  bed of the River Mokoko. The name refers to the water-bearing stratum  before alluded to; and in this ancient bed it bears enough of water  to admit of permanent wells in several parts of it. We had now the  assurance from Ramotobi that we should suffer no more from thirst. Twice  we found rain-water in the Mokoko before we reached Mokokonyani, where  the water, generally below ground elsewhere, comes to the surface in a  bed of tufa. The adjacent country is all covered with low, thorny scrub,  with grass, and here and there clumps of the \"wait-a-bit thorn\", or  'Acacia detinens'. At Lotlakani (a little reed), another spring three  miles farther down, we met with the first Palmyra trees which we had  seen in South Africa; they were twenty-six in number.    The ancient Mokoko must have been joined by other rivers below this, for  it becomes very broad, and spreads out into a large lake, of which the  lake we were now in search of formed but a very small part. We observed  that, wherever an ant-eater had made his hole, shells were thrown out  with the earth, identical with those now alive in the lake.    When we left the Mokoko, Ramotobi seemed, for the first time, to be at a  loss as to which direction to take. He had passed only once away to the  west of the Mokoko, the scenes of his boyhood. Mr. Oswell, while riding  in front of the wagons, happened to spy a Bushwoman running away in a  bent position, in order to escape observation. Thinking it to be a  lion, he galloped up to her. She thought herself captured, and began to  deliver up her poor little property, consisting of a few traps made of  cords; but, when I explained that we only wanted water, and would pay  her if she led us to it, she consented to conduct us to a spring. It was  then late in the afternoon, but she walked briskly before our horses for  eight miles, and showed us the water of Nchokotsa. After leading us to  the water, she wished to go away home, if indeed she had any--she had  fled from a party of her countrymen, and was now living far from all  others with her husband--but as it was now dark, we wished her to  remain. As she believed herself still a captive, we thought she might  slip away by night; so, in order that she should not go away with the  impression that we were dishonest, we gave her a piece of meat and a  good large bunch of beads; at the sight of the latter she burst into a  merry laugh, and remained without suspicion.    At Nchokotsa we came upon the first of a great number of salt-pans,  covered with an efflorescence of lime, probably the nitrate. A thick  belt of mopane-trees (a 'Bauhinia') hides this salt-pan, which is twenty  miles in circumference, entirely from the view of a person coming from  the southeast; and, at the time the pan burst upon our view, the setting  sun was casting a beautiful blue haze over the white incrustations,  making the whole look exactly like a lake. Oswell threw his hat up  in the air at the sight, and shouted out a huzza which made the poor  Bushwoman and the Bakwains think him mad. I was a little behind him, and  was as completely deceived by it as he; but, as we had agreed to allow  each other to behold the lake at the same instant, I felt a little  chagrined that he had, unintentionally, got the first glance. We had  no idea that the long-looked-for lake was still more than three hundred  miles distant. One reason of our mistake was, that the River Zouga was  often spoken of by the same name as the lake, viz., Noka ea Batletli  (\"River of the Batletli\").    The mirage on these salinas was marvelous. It is never, I believe,  seen in perfection, except over such saline incrustations. Here not a  particle of imagination was necessary for realizing the exact picture  of large collections of water; the waves danced along above, and the  shadows of the trees were vividly reflected beneath the surface in such  an admirable manner, that the loose cattle, whose thirst had not been  slaked sufficiently by the very brackish water of Nchokotsa, with the  horses, dogs, and even the Hottentots ran off toward the deceitful  pools. A herd of zebras in the mirage looked so exactly like elephants  that Oswell began to saddle a horse in order to hunt them; but a sort  of break in the haze dispelled the illusion. Looking to the west and  northwest from Nchokotsa, we could see columns of black smoke, exactly  like those from a steam-engine, rising to the clouds, and were assured  that these arose from the burning reeds of the Noka ea Batletli.    On the 4th of July we went forward on horseback toward what we supposed  to be the lake, and again and again did we seem to see it; but at last  we came to the veritable water of the Zouga, and found it to be a river  running to the N.E. A village of Bakurutse lay on the opposite bank;  these live among Batletli, a tribe having a click in their language, and  who were found by Sebituane to possess large herds of the great horned  cattle. They seem allied to the Hottentot family. Mr. Oswell, in  trying to cross the river, got his horse bogged in the swampy bank. Two  Bakwains and I managed to get over by wading beside a fishing-weir. The  people were friendly, and informed us that this water came out of the  Ngami. This news gladdened all our hearts, for we now felt certain of  reaching our goal. We might, they said, be a moon on the way; but we had  the River Zouga at our feet, and by following it we should at last reach  the broad water.    Next day, when we were quite disposed to be friendly with every one,  two of the Bamangwato, who had been sent on before us by Sekomi to drive  away all the Bushmen and Bakalahari from our path, so that they should  not assist or guide us, came and sat down by our fire. We had seen their  footsteps fresh in the way, and they had watched our slow movements  forward, and wondered to see how we, without any Bushmen, found our way  to the waters. This was the first time they had seen Ramotobi. \"You have  reached the river now,\" said they; and we, quite disposed to laugh at  having won the game, felt no ill-will to any one. They seemed to feel  no enmity to us either; but, after an apparently friendly conversation,  proceeded to fulfill to the last the instructions of their chief.  Ascending the Zouga in our front, they circulated the report that our  object was to plunder all the tribes living on the river and lake; but  when they had got half way up the river, the principal man sickened of  fever, turned back some distance, and died. His death had a good effect,  for the villagers connected it with the injury he was attempting to do  to us. They all saw through Sekomi's reasons for wishing us to fail in  our attempt; and though they came to us at first armed, kind and fair  treatment soon produced perfect confidence.    When we had gone up the bank of this beautiful river about ninety-six  miles from the point where we first struck it, and understood that we  were still a considerable distance from the Ngami, we left all the oxen  and wagons, except Mr. Oswell's, which was the smallest, and one team,  at Ngabisane, in the hope that they would be recruited for the home  journey, while we made a push for the lake. The Bechuana chief of the  Lake region, who had sent men to Sechele, now sent orders to all the  people on the river to assist us, and we were received by the Bakoba,  whose language clearly shows that they bear an affinity to the tribes  in the north. They call themselves Bayeiye, i.e., men; but the Bechuanas  call them Bakoba, which contains somewhat of the idea of slaves. They  have never been known to fight, and, indeed, have a tradition that their  forefathers, in their first essays at war, made their bows of the Palma  Christi, and, when these broke, they gave up fighting altogether. They  have invariably submitted to the rule of every horde which has overrun  the countries adjacent to the rivers on which they specially love to  dwell. They are thus the Quakers of the body politic in Africa.    A long time after the period of our visit, the chief of the Lake,  thinking to make soldiers of them, took the trouble to furnish them  with shields. \"Ah! we never had these before; that is the reason we have  always succumbed. Now we will fight.\" But a marauding party came from  the Makololo, and our \"Friends\" at once paddled quickly, night and day,  down the Zouga, never daring to look behind them till they reached the  end of the river, at the point where we first saw it.    The canoes of these inland sailors are truly primitive craft: they are  hollowed out of the trunks of single trees by means of iron adzes; and  if the tree has a bend, so has the canoe. I liked the frank and manly  bearing of these men, and, instead of sitting in the wagon, preferred a  seat in one of the canoes. I found they regarded their rude vessels  as the Arab does his camel. They have always fires in them, and prefer  sleeping in them while on a journey to spending the night on shore. \"On  land you have lions,\" say they, \"serpents, hyaenas, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#20)"],[1,"were the most celebrated,  and of these the Chian wine, the product of Chios, bore away the  palm from every other, and particularly that which was made from  vines growing on the mountain called Arevisia, in testimony of which  it were easy, if necessary, to produce an amphora full of classical  quotations.    The present inhabitants of that island make a small quantity of  excellent wine for their own use and are liberal of it to strangers  who travel that way, but dare not, being under Turkish government,  cultivate the vines well, or export the product of them.    {81a} In the same manner as Gulliver's island of Laputa.--From this  passage it is not improbable but that Swift borrowed the idea.    {81b} The account which Lucian here gives us of his visit to the  moon, perhaps suggested to Bergerac the idea of his ingenious work,  called \"A Voyage to the Moon.\"    {82a} Equi vultures, horse vultures; from [Greek], a horse:  and  [Greek], a vulture.    {82b} Lucian, we see, has founded his history on matter of fact.  Endymion, we all know, was a king of Elis, though some call him a  shepherd.  Shepherd or king, however, he was so handsome, that the  moon, who saw him sleeping on Mount Latmos, fell in love with him.  This no orthodox heathen ever doubted:  Lucian, who was a  freethinker, laughs indeed at the tale; but has made him ample  amends in this history by creating him emperor of the moon.    {83a} Modern astronomers are, I, think, agreed, that we are to the  moon just the same as the moon is to us.  Though Lucian's history  may be false, therefore his philosophy, we see, was true (1780).  (The moon is not habitable, 1887.)    {83b} This I am afraid, is not so agreeable to the modern system;  our philosophers all asserting that the sun is not habitable.  As it  is a place, however, which we are very little acquainted with, they  may be mistaken, and Lucian may guess as well as ourselves, for  aught we can prove to the contrary.    {84} Horse ants, from [Greek], a horse; and [Greek], an ant.    {85a} From [Greek], olus, any kind of herb; and [Greek], penna, a  wing.    {85b} Millii jaculatores, darters of millet; millet is a kind of  small grain.--A strange species of warriors!    {85c} Alliis pugnantes, garlic fighters:  these we are to suppose  threw garlic at the enemy, and served as a kind of stinkpots.    {85d} Pulici sagittarii, flea-archers.    {85e} Venti cursores, wind courser.    {86a} Passeres glandium, acorn sparrows.    {86b} Equi grues, horse-cranes.    {87a} Air-flies.    {87b} Gr. [Greek], air-crows; but as all crows fly through the air,  I would rather read [Greek], which may be translated air-dancers,  from [Greek], cordax, a lascivious kind of dance, so called.    {88a} Gr. [Greek], Caulo fungi, stalk and mushroom men.    {88b} Gr. [Greek], cani glandacii, acorn-dogs.    {88c} Gr. [Greek], nubicentauri, cloud-centaurs.    {88d} The reason for this wish is given a little farther on in the  History.    {89} See Hom. Il. II.. 1, 459.    {90a} Some authors tell us that Sagittarius was the same as Chiron  the centaur; others, that he was Crocus, a famous hunter, the son of  Euphemia, who nursed the Muses, at whose intercession, he was, after  his death, promoted to the ninth place in the Zodiac, under the name  of Sagittarius.    {90b} The inhabitants of the moon.    {92} A good burlesque on the usual form and style of treaties.    {93} Gr. [Greek], ignens, fiery, [Greek], flaming, [Greek],  nocturnus, nightly, [Greek], menstruus, monthly, [Greek], multi  lucius, many lights.  These all make good proper names in Greek, and  sound magnificently, but do not answer so well in English.  I have  therefore preserved the original words in the translation.    {94} Here Lucian, like other story-tellers, is a little deficient in  point of memory.  If they eat, as he tells us, nothing but frogs,  what use could they have for cheese?    {96} Of which we shall see an account in the next adventure.    {97} The city of Lamps.    {98a} The cloud cuckoo.    {98b} See his comedy of the Birds.    {104a} Salsamentarii:  Salt-fish-men.    {104b} Triton-weasels.    {104c} Greek, [Greek], cancri-mani, crab's hands.    {104d} Thynno-cipites, tunny-heads, i.e., men with heads like those  of the tunny-fish.    {105a} Greek, [Greek], crab-men.    {105b} [Greek], sparrow-footed, from [Greek], passer marinus.    {109} Maris potor, the drinker up of the sea.  AEolocentaurus and  Thalassopotes were, I suppose, two Leviathans.    {113} One of the fifty Nereids, or Sea-Nymphs; so called, on account  of the fairness of her skin:  from [Greek], gala, milk; of the milky  island, therefore, she was naturally the presiding deity.    {114a} Tyro, according to Homer, fell in love with the famous river  Enipeus, and was always wandering on its banks, where Neptune found  her, covered her with his waves, and throwing her into a deep sleep,  supplied the place of Enipeus.  Lucian has made her amends, by  bestowing one of his imaginary kingdoms upon her.  His part of the  story, however, is full as probable as the rest.    {114b} Suberipedes, cork-footed.    {116a} This description of the Pagan Elysium, or Island of the  Blessed, is well drawn, and abounds in fanciful and picturesque  imagery, interspersed with strokes of humour and satire.  The second  book is, indeed, throughout, more entertaining and better written  than the first.    {116b} See the Ajax Flagellifer of Sophocles.  Lucian humorously  degrades him from the character of a hero, and gives him hellebore  as a madman.    {118} It is not improbable but that Voltaire's El Dorado in his  \"Candide,\" might have been suggested to him by this passage.    {119} I.e. Their appearance is exactly like that of shadows made by  the sun at noonday, with this only difference, that one lies flat on  the ground, the other is erect, and one is dark, the other light or  diaphanous.  Our vulgar idea of ghosts, especially with regard to  their not being tangible, corresponds with this of Lucian's.    {121a} A famous musician.  Clemens Alexandrinus gives us a full  account of him, to whom I refer the curious reader.    {121b} This poet, we are told, wrote some severe verses on Helen,  for which he was punished by Castor and Pollux with loss of sight,  but on making his recantation in a palinodia, his eyes were  graciously restored to him.  Lucian has affronted her still more  grossly by making her run away with Cinyrus; but he, we are to  suppose, being not over superstitious, defied the power of Castor  and Pollux.    {122a} Nothing appears more ridiculous to a modern reader than the  perpetual encomiums on the musical merit of swans and swallows,  which we meet with in all the writers of antiquity.  A proper  account and explanation of this is, I think, amongst the desiderata  of literature.  There is an entertaining tract on this subject in  the \"Hist. de l'Acad.\" tom. v., by M. Morin.    {122b} Who ravished Cassandra, the daughter of Priam and priestess  of Minerva, who sent a tempest, dispersed the Grecian navy in their  return home, and sunk Ajax with a thunder-bolt.    {123a} A scholar of Pythagoras.    {123b} The second king of Rome.    {123c} One of the seven sages, but excepted against by Lucian,  because he was king of Corinth and a tyrant.    {123d} See his Treatise \"de Republica.\"  His quitting Elysium, to  live in his own republic, is a stroke of true humour.    {124a} Alluding to a passage in Hesiod already quoted.    {124b} Lucian laughs at the sceptics, though he was himself one of  them.    {126} Death-games, or games after death, in imitation of wedding-  games, funeral-games, etc.    {127a} The famous tyrant of Agrigentum, renowned for his ingenious  contrivance of roasting his enemies in a brazen bull, and not less  memorable for some excellent epistles, which set a wit and scholar  together by the ears concerning the genuineness of them.  See the  famous contest between Bentley and Boyle.    {127b} Who sacrificed to Jupiter all the strangers that came into  his kingdom.  \"Hospites violabat,\" says Seneca, \"ut eorum sanguine  pluviam eliceret, cujus penuria AEgyptus novem annis laboraverat.\"  A most ingenious contrivance.    {128a} A king of Thrace who fed his horses with human flesh.    {128b} Scyron and Pityocamptes were two famous robbers, who used to  seize on travellers and commit the most horrid cruelties upon them.  They were slain by Theseus.  See Plutarch's \"Life of Theseus.\"    {128c} Where he ran away, but, as we are told, in very good company.  See Diog. Laert. Strabo, etc.    {132} The Antipodes.  We never heard whether Lucian performed this  voyage.  D'Ablancourt, however, his French translator, in his  continuation of the \"True History,\" has done it for him, not without  some humour, though it is by no means equal to the original.    {135a} Voltaire has improved on this passage, and given us a very  humorous account of \"les Habitans de l'Enfer,\" in his wicked  \"Pucelle.\"    {135b} Who, the reader will remember, had just before run off with  Helen.    {136a} Greek, [Greek], sleep.    {136b} As herald of the morn.    {136c} A root which, infused, is supposed to promote sleep,  consequently very proper for the Island of Dreams.                    \"Not poppy, nor mandragora,       Nor all the drowsy syrups of the East,       Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep       Which thou ow'dst yesterday.\"                                See Shakespeare's \"Othello.\"    {136d} Night wanderer.    {137a} Gr. [Greek], inexperrectus, unwaked or wakeful.    {137b} Gr. [Greek], pernox, all night.    {137c}   \"Two portals firm the various phantoms keep;            Of ev'ry one; whence flit, to mock the brain,            Of winged lies a light fantastic train;            The gate opposed pellucid valves adorn,            And columns fair, encased with polished horn;            Where images of truth for passage wait.\"                        See Pope's Homer's \"Odyssey,"]]]
