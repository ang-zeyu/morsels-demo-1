But alas! it went the  wrong way: instead of going down, it went up.  Frightened as she was,  however, she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair  could lead.  It was very narrow, and so steep that she went on like a  four-legged creature on her hands and feet.        CHAPTER 3    The Princess and--We Shall See Who    When she came to the top, she found herself in a little square place,  with three doors, two opposite each other, and one opposite the top of  the stair.  She stood for a moment, without an idea in her little head  what to do next.  But as she stood, she began to hear a curious humming  sound.  Could it be the rain?  No.  It was much more gentle, and even  monotonous than the sound of the rain, which now she scarcely heard.  The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping for a little  while and then beginning again.  It was more like the hum of a very  happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower,  than anything else I can think of at this moment.  Where could it come  from?  She laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was  there--then to another.  When she laid her ear against the third door,  there could be no doubt where it came from: it must be from something  in that room.  What could it be?  She was rather afraid, but her  curiosity was stronger than her fear, and she opened the door very  gently and peeped in.  What do you think she saw?  A very old lady who  sat spinning.    Perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady  was an old lady, when I inform you that not only was she beautiful, but  her skin was smooth and white.  I will tell you more.  Her hair was  combed back from her forehead and face, and hung loose far down and all  over her back.  That is not much like an old lady--is it?  Ah! but it  was white almost as snow.  And although her face was so smooth, her  eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be  old.  The princess, though she could not have told you why, did think  her very old indeed--quite fifty, she said to herself.  But she was  rather older than that, as you shall hear.    While the princess stared bewildered, with her head just inside the  door, the old lady lifted hers, and said, in a sweet, but old and  rather shaky voice, which mingled very pleasantly with the continued  hum of her wheel:    'Come in, my dear; come in.  I am glad to see you.'    That the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly;  for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door, and stare without  moving, as I have known some do who ought to have been princesses but  were only rather vulgar little girls.  She did as she was told, stepped  inside the door at once, and shut it gently behind her.    'Come to me, my dear,' said the old lady.    And again the princess did as she was told.  She approached the old  lady--rather slowly, I confess--but did not stop until she stood by her  side, and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted  stars in them.    'Why, what have you been doing with your eyes, child?' asked the old  lady.    'Crying,' answered the princess.    'Why, child?'    'Because I couldn't find my way down again.'    'But you could find your way up.'    'Not at first--not for a long time.'    'But your face is streaked like the back of a zebra.  Hadn't you a  handkerchief to wipe your eyes with?'    'No.'    'Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?'    'Please, I didn't know you were here.  I will next time.'    'There's a good child!' said the old lady.    Then she stopped her wheel, and rose, and, going out of the room,  returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel, with which  she washed and wiped the bright little face.  And the princess thought  her hands were so smooth and nice!    When she carried away the basin and towel, the little princess wondered  to see how straight and tall she was, for, although she was so old, she  didn't stoop a bit.  She was dressed in black velvet with thick white  heavy-looking lace about it; and on the black dress her hair shone like  silver.  There was hardly any more furniture in the room than there  might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by  her spinning.  There was no carpet on the floor--no table  anywhere--nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it.  When  she came back, she sat down and without a word began her spinning once  more, while Irene, who had never seen a spinning-wheel, stood by her  side and looked on.  When the old lady had got her thread fairly going  again, she said to the princess, but without looking at her:    'Do you know my name, child?'    'No, I don't know it,' answered the princess.    'My name is Irene.'    'That's my name!' cried the princess.    'I know that.  I let you have mine.  I haven't got your name. You've  got mine.'    'How can that be?' asked the princess, bewildered.  'I've always had my  name.'    'Your papa, the king, asked me if I had any objection to your having  it; and, of course, I hadn't.  I let you have it with pleasure.'    'It was very kind of you to give me your name--and such a pretty one,'  said the princess.    'Oh, not so very kind!' said the old lady.  'A name is one of those  things one can give away and keep all the same.  I have a good many  such things.  Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?'    'Yes, that I should--very much.'    'I'm your great-great-grandmother,' said the lady.    'What's that?' asked the princess.    'I'm your father's mother's father's mother.'    'Oh, dear! I can't understand that,' said the princess.    'I dare say not.  I didn't expect you would.  But that's no reason why  I shouldn't say it.'    'Oh, no!' answered the princess.    'I will explain it all to you when you are older,' the lady went on.  'But you will be able to understand this much now: I came here to take  care of you.'    'Is it long since you came?  Was it yesterday?  Or was it today,  because it was so wet that I couldn't get out?'    'I've been here ever since you came yourself.'    'What a long time!' said the princess.  'I don't remember it at all.'    'No.  I suppose not.'    'But I never saw you before.'    'No.  But you shall see me again.'    'Do you live in this room always?'    'I don't sleep in it.  I sleep on the opposite side of the landing. I  sit here most of the day.'    'I shouldn't like it.  My nursery is much prettier.  You must be a  queen too, if you are my great big grand-mother.'    'Yes, I am a queen.'    'Where is your crown, then?' 'In my bedroom.'    'I should like to see it.'    'You shall some day--not today.'    'I wonder why nursie never told me.'    'Nursie doesn't know.  She never saw me.'    'But somebody knows that you are in the house?'    'No; nobody.'    'How do you get your dinner, then?'    'I keep poultry--of a sort.'    'Where do you keep them?'    'I will show you.'    'And who makes the chicken broth for you?'    'I never kill any of MY chickens.'    'Then I can't understand.'    'What did you have for breakfast this morning?' asked the lady.    'Oh! I had bread and milk, and an egg--I dare say you eat their eggs.'    'Yes, that's it.  I eat their eggs.'    'Is that what makes your hair so white?'    'No, my dear.  It's old age.  I am very old.'    'I thought so.  Are you fifty?'    'Yes--more than that.'    'Are you a hundred?'    'Yes--more than that.  I am too old for you to guess.  Come and see my  chickens.'    Again she stopped her spinning.  She rose, took the princess by the  hand, led her out of the room, and opened the door opposite the stair.  The princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens, but instead of  that, she saw the blue sky first, and then the roofs of the house, with  a multitude of the loveliest pigeons, mostly white, but of all colours,  walking about, making bows to each other, and talking a language she  could not understand.  She clapped her hands with delight, and up rose  such a flapping of wings that she in her turn was startled.    'You've frightened my poultry,' said the old lady, smiling.    'And they've frightened me,' said the princess, smiling too.  'But what  very nice poultry!  Are the eggs nice?'    'Yes, very nice.' 'What a small egg-spoon you must have!  Wouldn't it  be better to keep hens, and get bigger eggs?'    'How should I feed them, though?'    'I see,' said the princess.  'The pigeons feed themselves.  They've got  wings.'    'Just so.  If they couldn't fly, I couldn't eat their eggs.'    'But how do you get at the eggs?  Where are their nests?'    The lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side  of the door and, lifting a shutter, showed a great many pigeon-holes  with nests, some with young ones and some with eggs in them.  The birds  came in at the other side, and she took out the eggs on this side.  She  closed it again quickly, lest the young ones should be frightened.    'Oh, what a nice way!' cried the princess.  'Will you give me an egg to  eat?  I'm rather hungry.'    'I will some day, but now you must go back, or nursie will be miserable  about you.  I dare say she's looking for you everywhere.'    'Except here,' answered the princess.  'Oh, how surprised she will be  when I tell her about my great big grand-grand-mother!'    'Yes, that she will!' said the old lady with a curious smile. 'Mind you  tell her all about it exactly.'    'That I will.  Please will you take me back to her?'    'I can't go all the way, but I will take you to the top of the stair,  and then you must run down quite fast into your own room.'    The little princess put her hand in the old lady's, who, looking this  way and that, brought her to the top of the first stair, and thence to  the bottom of the second, and did not leave her till she saw her  half-way down the third.  When she heard the cry of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#2)"],[1,"e.      After a long day's journey on the Grand Trunk Railway, without even the  eccentricities of fellow-passengers in our Pullman car to amuse us, we  were all glad to reach Sarnia. The monotony of the scenery through which  we passed had been unbroken, except by a prettily situated cemetery, and  the tasteful architecture of a hillside church, surrounded by trees just  putting on their spring foliage.    It was eight o'clock when we got to the wharf, and the steamer  _Manitoba_ only waited for our arrival to cast loose her moorings  and enter the dark blue waters of Lake Huron. \"Haste\" will not express  the excitement of the scene. Men, rushing hither and thither in search of  friends, traps, and luggage, were goaded to fury by the calmness of the  officials and their determination not to be hurried. Hearing there was no  chance of having tea on board that night, and discovering near the wharf  a signboard announcing that meals could be obtained at all hours (except,  as we were told, that particular one), we with difficulty persuaded the  proprietress to let us have something to eat. Amidst muttered grumblings  that she was \"slaved to death,\" that \"her life was not worth a rap,\" and  so on, every remark being emphasized with a plate or dish, we were at  last supplied with bread, cheese, and beef-steak, for which we were  kindly allowed to pay fifty cents (2s. 6d.) each.    The scene on board the boat beggars description. The other steamers being  still ice-bound on Lake Superior, the _Manitoba_ was obliged to take  as much freight and as many passengers as she could carry, many of the  latter having been waiting in Sarnia upwards of ten days for her  departure. Surveying parties, immigrants of almost every nation on their  way to make homes in the great North West, crowded the decks and  gangways. The confusion of tongues, the shrill cries of the frightened  and tired children, the oaths of excited men, and the trundling and  thumping of the baggage, mingled with the shrieks of adjacent engines  \"made night hideous.\" Porters and cabmen jostled women laden with baskets  of linen, brought on board at the last minute, when the poor tired  stewardess had no time to administer the well-merited reprimand;  passengers rushed about in search of the purser, anxious to secure their  state-rooms before they were usurped by some one else.    It was midnight when the commotion had subsided, and quarters were  assigned to all but a stray man or two wandering about in search of some  Mr. Brown or Mr. Jones, whose room he was to share. Climbing into my  berth, I soon fell asleep; but only for a few moments. The shrill  whistle, the vehement ringing of the captain's bell, the heavy beat of  the paddles, roused me; and as we left the wharf and steamed out from  among the ships and small craft dotting the water on every side, \"Off at  last!\" was shouted from the crowded decks. Then the opening bars of \"God  save the Queen\" were sung heartily and not inharmoniously, followed by  three cheers for her Majesty, three for her Imperial Highness, three for  her popular representative Lord Dufferin, and so on, till the enthusiasm  culminated in \"He's a jolly good fellow;\" the monotony of which sent me  to sleep again.    At four o'clock next morning I scrambled out of my berth at the imminent  risk of broken bones, wondering why the inventive powers of our Yankee  neighbours had not hit upon some arrangement to facilitate the descent;  dressed, and went in search of fresh air. Picking my steps quietly  between sleeping forms--for men in almost every attitude, some with  blankets or great-coats rolled round them, were lying on the floor and  lounges in the saloon--I reached the deck just as the sun rose above the  broad blue waters, brightening every moment the band of gold where sky  and water met. Clouds of ink-black smoke floated from our funnel, tinged  by the rising sun with every shade of yellow, red, and brown. Mirrored in  the calm water below, lay the silent steamer--silent, save for the  ceaseless revolution of her paddles, whose monotonous throb seemed like  the beating of a great heart.    For an hour or more I revelled in the beauty of water and sky, and ceased  to wonder why people born on the coast love the sea so dearly, and pine  for the sight of its waves. When the men came to wash the decks, a  pleasant, brawny fellow told me we were likely to have a good run up the  lakes. The storms of the last few days having broken up the ice, and  driven it into the open, there was hope both of the ice-locked steamers  getting out, and of our getting into Duluth without much trouble--\"unless  the wind changes, which is more than possible,\" he added abruptly; and  walked off, as if fearful of my believing his sanguine predictions too  implicitly.    Later the passengers appeared, grumbling at the cold, and at being  obliged to turn out so early, and wishing breakfast were ready. Of this  wished-for meal the clatter of dishes in the saloon soon gave welcome  warning. Dickens says that when, before taking his first meal on board an  American steamer, \"he tore after the rushing crowd to see what was wrong,  dreadful visions of fire, in its most aggravated form, floated through  his mind; but it was only _dinner_ that the hungry public were  rushing to devour.\" We were nearly as bad on the _Manitoba_, the  friendly steward warning most of us to secure our seats without delay,  the cabin-walls being gradually lined with people on either side, each  behind a chair. One of the \"boys\" strode ostentatiously down the long  saloon, ringing a great hand-bell, which summoned a mixed multitude  pell-mell to the scene of action, only to retreat in disappointment at  finding the field already occupied.    It was amusing to watch the different expressions on the faces down the  lines while waiting for breakfast. Men, chiefly surveyors, who during  their annual trips to and from work had got used to \"that sort of thing,\"  took it coolly; judiciously choosing a seat directly opposite their  state-room door, or standing in the background, but near enough to expel  any intruder. New men, looking as uncomfortable as if they had been  caught in petty larceny, twisted their youthful moustaches, put their  hands in their pockets, or leant against the wall, trying to look  perfectly indifferent as to the event; some of their neighbours smiling  satirically at their folly. Old farmer-looking bodies, grumbling at the  crush, mingled with Yankees, toothpick in hand, ready for business;  sturdy Englishmen whom one knew appreciated creature comforts; and dapper  little Frenchmen, hungry yet polite. Here stood a bright-looking  Irishwoman, who vainly tried to restrain the impatience of five or six  children, whose faces still shone from the friction of their morning  ablutions; there, an old woman, well-nigh double with age, who, rather  than be separated from the two stalwart sons by her side, was going to  end her days in a strange land. Here was a group of bright, chatty little  French Canadians, with the usual superabundance of earrings and gay  ribbons decorating their persons; there, a great raw-boned Scotchwoman,  inwardly lamenting the porridge of her native land, frowned upon the  company.    The bell ceased, and--\"Presto!\" all were seated, and turning over their  plates as if for a wager. Then came a confused jumble of tongues, all  talking at once; the rattle of dishes, the clatter of knives and forks,  and the rushing about of the boy-waiters. It required quick wit to choose  a breakfast dish, from the \"White-fish--finanhaddy--beefsteak--cold  roastbeef--muttonchop--bacon--potatoes--toast--roll--brown-bread-or-  white--tea-or-coffee,\" shouted breathlessly by a youth on one side, while  his comrade screamed the same, in a shrill falsetto, to one's neighbour  on the other; their not starting simultaneously making the confusion  worse confounded. Such was the economical mode of setting forth the bill  of fare on the _Manitoba_. There were three hundred and fifty people  on hoard; more than one-third of whom were cabin, or would-be cabin,  passengers. The accommodation being insufficient, some were camping on  the upper deck, some in the saloon, many on the stairs, and others  wherever elbow-room could be found. Breakfast began at half-past seven,  and at half-past nine the late risers were still at it; and it was not  long before the same thing (only more so!), in the shape of dinner, had  to be gone through.    As Lake Huron was calm and our boat steady, we had more \"God save the  Queen\" after dinner, besides \"Rule, Britannia\" and other patriotic songs,  several of the passengers playing the piano very well. Some one also  played a violin, and the men, clearing the saloon of sofas and  superfluous chairs, danced a double set of quadrilles, after having tried  in vain to persuade some of the emigrant girls to become their partners.  They were an amusing group--from the grinning steward, who, cap on head,  figured away through all the steps he could recollect or invent (some of  them marvels of skill and agility in their way), to the solemn young man,  only anxious to do his duty creditably. But alas for the short-lived  joviality of the multitude! After touching at Southampton the boat  altered her course, and the effect of her occasional rolls in the trough  of the waves soon became manifest.    One by one the less courageous of the crowd crept away. Every face soon  blanched with terror at the common enemy. Wretched women feebly tried to  help crying children, though too ill to move themselves; others threw  them down anywhere, to be able to escape in time for the threatened  paroxysm; all were groaning, wan and miserable, railing at the poor,  wearied stewardess, calling her here, there, and everywhere at the same  time, and threatening her as if she were the sole cause of their woe.  About midnight, our course being altered, \"Richard was"]]]
