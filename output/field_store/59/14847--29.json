Sir, you have taken  By force what I this very day designed  To have delivered to you. There's a letter  Amongst these papers for my royal sister  Of England. Pledge me, sir, your word of honor,  To give it to her majesty's own hands,  And not to the deceitful care of Burleigh.    PAULET.  I shall consider what is best to do.    MARY.  Sir, you shall know its import. In this letter  I beg a favor, a great favor of her,--  That she herself will give me audience,--she  Whom I have never seen. I have been summoned  Before a court of men, whom I can ne'er  Acknowledge as my peers--of men to whom  My heart denies its confidence. The queen  Is of my family, my rank, my sex;  To her alone--a sister, queen, and woman--  Can I unfold my heart.    PAULET.              Too oft, my lady,  Have you intrusted both your fate and honor  To men less worthy your esteem than these.    MARY.  I, in the letter, beg another favor,  And surely naught but inhumanity  Can here reject my prayer. These many years  Have I, in prison, missed the church's comfort,  The blessings of the sacraments--and she  Who robs me of my freedom and my crown,  Who seeks my very life, can never wish  To shut the gates of heaven upon my soul.    PAULET.  Whene'er you wish, the dean shall wait upon you.    MARY (interrupting him sharply).  Talk to me not of deans. I ask the aid  Of one of my own church--a Catholic priest.    PAULET.  [That is against the published laws of England.    MARY.  The laws of England are no rule for me.  I am not England's subject; I have ne'er  Consented to its laws, and will not bow  Before their cruel and despotic sway.  If 'tis your will, to the unheard-of rigor  Which I have borne, to add this new oppression,  I must submit to what your power ordains;  Yet will I raise my voice in loud complaints.]  I also wish a public notary,  And secretaries, to prepare my will--  My sorrows and my prison's wretchedness  Prey on my life--my days, I fear, are numbered--  I feel that I am near the gates of death.    PAULET.  These serious contemplations well become you.    MARY.  And know I then that some too ready hand  May not abridge this tedious work of sorrow?  I would indite my will and make disposal  Of what belongs to me.    PAULET.              This liberty  May be allowed to you, for England's queen  Will not enrich herself by plundering you.    MARY.  I have been parted from my faithful women,  And from my servants; tell me, where are they?  What is their fate? I can indeed dispense  At present with their service, but my heart  Will feel rejoiced to know these faithful ones  Are not exposed to suffering and to want!    PAULET.  Your servants have been cared for; [and again  You shall behold whate'er is taken from you  And all shall be restored in proper season.]                     [Going.    MARY.  And will you leave my presence thus again,  And not relieve my fearful, anxious heart  From the fell torments of uncertainty?  Thanks to the vigilance of your hateful spies,  I am divided from the world; no voice  Can reach me through these prison-walls; my fate  Lies in the hands of those who wish my ruin.  A month of dread suspense is passed already  Since when the forty high commissioners  Surprised me in this castle, and erected,  With most unseemly haste, their dread tribunal;  They forced me, stunned, amazed, and unprepared,  Without an advocate, from memory,  Before their unexampled court, to answer  Their weighty charges, artfully arranged.  They came like ghosts,--like ghosts they disappeared,  And since that day all mouths are closed to me.  In vain I seek to construe from your looks  Which hath prevailed--my cause's innocence  And my friends' zeal--or my foes' cursed counsel.  Oh, break this silence! let me know the worst;  What have I still to fear, and what to hope.    PAULET.  Close your accounts with heaven.    MARY.                   From heaven I hope  For mercy, sir; and from my earthly judges  I hope, and still expect, the strictest justice.    PAULET.  Justice, depend upon it, will be done you.    MARY.  Is the suit ended, sir?    PAULET.               I cannot tell.    MARY.  Am I condemned?    PAULET.           I cannot answer, lady.    MARY.  [Sir, a good work fears not the light of day.    PAULET.  The day will shine upon it, doubt it not.]    MARY.  Despatch is here the fashion. Is it meant  The murderer shall surprise me, like the judges?    PAULET.  Still entertain that thought and he will find you  Better prepared to meet your fate than they did.    MARY (after a pause).  Sir, nothing can surprise me which a court  Inspired by Burleigh's hate and Hatton's zeal,  Howe'er unjust, may venture to pronounce:  But I have yet to learn how far the queen  Will dare in execution of the sentence.    PAULET.  The sovereigns of England have no fear  But for their conscience and their parliament.  What justice hath decreed her fearless hand  Will execute before the assembled world.        SCENE III.       The same. MORTIMER enters, and without paying attention     to the QUEEN, addresses PAULET.    MORTIMER.  Uncle, you're sought for.       [He retires in the same manner. The QUEEN remarks it, and     turns towards PAULET, who is about to follow him.    MARY.                Sir, one favor more  If you have aught to say to me--from you  I can bear much--I reverence your gray hairs;  But cannot bear that young man's insolence;  Spare me in future his unmannered rudeness.    PAULET.  I prize him most for that which makes you hate him  He is not, truly, one of those poor fools  Who melt before a woman's treacherous tears.  He has seen much--has been to Rheims and Paris,  And brings us back his true old English heart.  Lady, your cunning arts are lost on him.                       [Exit.        SCENE IV.       MARY, KENNEDY.    KENNEDY.  And dare the ruffian venture to your face  Such language! Oh, 'tis hard--'tis past endurance.    MARY (lost in reflection).  In the fair moments of our former splendor  We lent to flatterers a too willing ear;--  It is but just, good Hannah, we should now  Be forced to hear the bitter voice of censure.    KENNEDY.  So downcast, so depressed, my dearest lady!  You, who before so gay, so full of hope,  Were used to comfort me in my distress;  More gracious were the task to check your mirth  Than chide your heavy sadness.    MARY.                  Well I know him--  It is the bleeding Darnley's royal shade,  Rising in anger from his darksome grave  And never will he make his peace with me  Until the measures of my woes be full.    KENNEDY.  What thoughts are these--    MARY.               Thou may'st forget it, Hannah;  But I've a faithful memory--'tis this day  Another wretched anniversary  Of that regretted, that unhappy deed--  Which I must celebrate with fast and penance.    KENNEDY.  Dismiss at length in peace this evil spirit.  The penitence of many a heavy year,  Of many a suffering, has atoned the deed;  The church, which holds the key of absolution,  Pardons the crime, and heaven itself's appeased.    MARY.  This long-atoned crime arises fresh  And bleeding from its lightly-covered grave;  My husband's restless spirit seeks revenge;  No sacred bell can exorcise, no host  In priestly hands dismiss it to his tomb.    KENNEDY.  You did not murder him; 'twas done by others.    MARY.  But it was known to me; I suffered it,  And lured him with my smiles to death's embrace.    KENNEDY.  Your youth extenuates your guilt. You were  Of tender years.    MARY.           So tender, yet I drew  This heavy guilt upon my youthful head.    KENNEDY.  You were provoked by direst injuries,  And by the rude presumption of the man,  Whom out of darkness, like the hand of heaven,  Your love drew forth, and raised above all others.  Whom through your bridal chamber you conducted  Up to your throne, and with your lovely self,  And your hereditary crown, distinguished  [Your work was his existence, and your grace  Bedewed him like the gentle rains of heaven.]  Could he forget that his so splendid lot  Was the creation of your generous love?  Yet did he, worthless as he was, forget it.  With base suspicions, and with brutal manners,  He wearied your affections, and became  An object to you of deserved disgust:  The illusion, which till now had overcast  Your judgment, vanished; angrily you fled  His foul embrace, and gave him up to scorn.  And did he seek again to win your love?  Your favor? Did he e'er implore your pardon?  Or fall in deep repentance at your feet?  No; the base wretch defied you; he, who was  Your bounty's creature, wished to play your king,  [And strove, through fear, to force your inclination.]  Before your eyes he had your favorite singer,  Poor Rizzio, murdered; you did but avenge  With blood the bloody deed----    MARY.                 And bloodily,  I fear, too soon 'twill be avenged on me:  You seek to comfort me, and you condemn me.    KENNEDY.  You were, when you consented to this deed,  No more yourself; belonged not to yourself;  The madness of a frantic love possessed you,  And bound you to a terrible seducer,  The wretched Bothwell. That despotic man  Ruled you with shameful, overbearing will,  And with his philters and his hellish arts  Inflamed your passions.    MARY.               All the arts he used  Were man's superior strength and woman's weakness.    KENNEDY.  No, no, I say. The most pernicious spirits  Of hell he must have summoned to his aid,  To cast this mist before your waking senses.  Your ear no more was open to the voice  Of friendly warning, and your eyes were shut  To decency; soft female bashfulness  Deserted you; those cheeks, which were before  The seat of virtuous, blushing modesty,  Glowed with the flames of unrestrained desire.

We have now ascertained that there is beauty and sublimity in nature, in  ideas, in feelings, and in actions. After all this it might be supposed  that a unity could be found amidst these different kinds of beauty. The  sight of a statue, as the Apollo of Belvedere, of a man, of Socrates  expiring, are adduced as producing impressions of the beautiful; but the  form cannot be a form by itself, it must be the form of something.  Physical beauty is the sign of an interior beauty, a spiritual and moral  beauty which is the basis, the principle, and the unity of the beautiful.    Physical beauty is an envelop to intellectual and to moral beauty.    Intellectual beauty, the splendor of the true, can only have for  principle that of all truth.    Moral beauty comprehends two distinct elements, equally beautiful,  justice and charity. Thus God is the principle of the three orders of  beauty, physical, intellectual, and moral. He also construes the two  great powers distributed over the three orders, the beautiful and the  sublime. God is beauty par excellence; He is therefore perfectly  beautiful; He is equally sublime. He is to us the type and sense of the  two great forms of beauty. In short, the Absolute Being as absolute  unity and absolute variety is necessarily the ultimate principle, the  extreme basis, the finished ideal of all beauty. This was the marvellous  beauty which Diotimus had seen, and which is described in the Banquet of  Socrates.    It is our purpose after the previous discussion to attempt to elucidate  still further the idea of art by following its historic development.    Many questions bearing on art and relating to the beautiful had been  propounded before, even as far back as Plotinus, Plato, and Socrates, but  recent times have been the real cradle of aesthetics as a science.  Modern philosophy was the first to recognize that beauty in art is one of  the means by which the contradictions can be removed between mind  considered in its abstract and absolute existence and nature constituting  the world of sense, bringing back these two factors to unity.    Kant was the first who felt the want of this union and expressed it, but  without determining its conditions or expressing it scientifically. He  was impeded in his efforts to effect this union by the opposition between  the subjective and the objective, by his placing practical reason above  theoretical reason, and he set up the opposition found in the moral  sphere as the highest principle of morality. Reduced to this difficulty,  all that Kant could do was to express the union under the form of the  subjective ideas of reason, or as postulates to be deduced from the  practical reason, without their essential character being known, and  representing their realization as nothing more than a simple you ought,  or imperative \"Du sollst.\"    In his teleological judgment applied to living beings, Kant comes, on the  contrary, to consider the living organism in such wise that, the general  including the particular, and determining it as an end, consequently the  idea also determines the external, the compound of the organs, not by an  act springing from without but issuing from within. In this way the end  and the means, the interior and exterior, the general and particular, are  confounded in unity. But this judgment only expresses a subjective act  of reflection, and does not throw any light on the object in itself.  Kant has the same view of the aesthetic judgment. According to him the  judgment does not proceed either from reason, as the faculty of general  ideas, or from sensuous perception, but from the free play of the reason  and of the imagination. In this analysis of the cognitive faculty, the  object only exists relatively to the subject and to the feeling of  pleasure or the enjoyment that it experiences.    The characteristics of the beautiful are, according to Kant:--    1. The pleasure it procures is free from interest.    2. Beauty appears to us as an object of general enjoyment, without  awakening in us the consciousness of an abstract idea and of a category  of reason to which we might refer our judgment.    3. Beauty ought to embrace in itself the relation of conformity to its  end, but in such a way that this conformity may be grasped without the  idea of the end being offered to our mind.    4. Though it be not accompanied by an abstract idea, beauty ought to be  acknowledged as the object of a necessary enjoyment.    A special feature of all this system is the indissoluble unity of what is  supposed to be separated in consciousness. This distinction disappears  in the beautiful, because in it the general and the particular, the end  and the means, the idea and the object, mentally penetrate each other  completely. The particular in itself, whether it be opposed to itself or  to what is general, is something accidental. But here what may be  considered as an accidental form is so intimately connected with the  general that it is confounded and identified with it. By this means the  beautiful in art presents thought to us as incarnate. On the other hand,  matter, nature, the sensuous as themselves possessing measure, end, and  harmony, are raised to the dignity of spirit and share in its general  character. Thought not only abandons its hostility against nature, but  smiles in her. Sensation and enjoyment are justified and sanctified, so  that nature and liberty, sense and ideas, find their justification and  their sanctification in this union. Nevertheless this reconciliation,  though seemingly perfect, is stricken with the character of  subjectiveness. It cannot constitute the absolutely true and real.    Such is an outline of the principal results of Kant's criticism, and  Hegel passes high praise on the profoundly philosophic mind of Schiller,  who demanded the union and reconciliation of the two principles, and who  tried to give a scientific explanation of it before the problem had been  solved by philosophy. In his \"Letters on Aesthetic Education,\" Schiller  admits that man carries in himself the germ of the ideal man which is  realized and represented by the state. There are two ways for the  individual man to approach the ideal man; first, when the state,  considered as morality, justice, and general reason, absorbs the  individualities in its unity; secondly, when the individual rises to the  ideal of his species by the perfecting of himself. Reason demands unity,  conformity to the species; nature, on the other hand, demands plurality  and individuality; and man is at once solicited by two contrary laws. In  this conflict, aesthetic education must come in to effect the  reconciliation of the two principles; for, according to Schiller, it has  as its end to fashion and polish the inclinations and passions so that  they may become reasonable, and that, on the other hand, reason and  freedom may issue from their abstract character, may unite with nature,  may spiritualize it, become incarnate, and take a body in it. Beauty is  thus given as the simultaneous development of the rational and of the  sensuous, fused together, and interpenetrated one by the other, an union  that constitutes in fact true reality.    This unity of the general and of the particular, of liberty and necessity  of the spiritual and material, which Schiller understood scientifically  as the spirit of art, and which he tried to make appear in real life by  aesthetic art and education, was afterwards put forward under the name of  idea as the principle of all knowledge and existence. In this way,  through the agency of Schelling, science raised itself to an absolute  point of view. It was thus that art began to claim its proper nature and  dignity. From that time its proper place was finally marked out for it  in science, though the mode of viewing it still labored under certain  defects. Its high and true distinction were at length understood.    In viewing the higher position to which recent philosophical systems have  raised the theory of art in Germany, we must not overlook the advantages  contributed by the study of the ideal of the ancients by such men as  Winckelmann, who, by a kind of inspiration, raised art criticism from a  carping about petty details to seek the true spirit of great works of  art, and their true ideas, by a study of the spirit of the originals.    It has appeared expedient to conclude this introduction with a summary of  the latest and highest theory of art and aesthetics issuing from Kant and  Schiller, and developed in the later philosophy of Hegel.    Our space only allows us to give a glance, first, at the metaphysics of  the beautiful as developed by Hegel in the first part of his 'Aesthetik,'  and then at the later development of the same system in recent writers  issuing from his school.    Hegel considers, first, the abstract idea of the beautiful; secondly,  beauty in nature; thirdly, beauty in art or the ideal; and he winds up  with an examination of the qualities of the artist.    His preliminary remarks are directed to show the relations of art to  religion and philosophy, and he shows that man's destination is an  infinite development. In real life he only satisfies his longing  partially and imperfectly by limited enjoyments. In science he finds a  nobler pleasure, and civil life opens a career for his activity; but he  only finds an imperfect pleasure in these pursuits. He cannot then find  the ideal after which he sighs. Then he rises to a higher sphere, where  all contradictions are effaced and the ideas of good and happiness are  realized in perfect accord and in constant harmony. This deep want of  the soul is satisfied in three ways: in art, in religion, and in  philosophy.    Art is intended to make us contemplate the true and the infinite in forms  of sense. Yet even art does not fully satisfy the deepest need of the  soul. The soul wants to contemplate truth in its inmost"]]]
