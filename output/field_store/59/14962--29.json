But his heart was bitterly angry, for his blood was hot and  youthful and prone to boil.    Now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left  Robin Hood alone; but his anger was hot, both because the youth had  gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that  he had been quaffing. So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to  his feet, and seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft. \"Ay,\" cried  he, \"and I'll hurry thee anon.\" And he sent the arrow whistling after  Robin.    It was well for Robin Hood that that same forester's head was spinning  with ale, or else he would never have taken another step. As it was, the  arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then he turned around  and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.    \"Ye said I was no archer,\" cried he aloud, \"but say so now again!\"    The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on  his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him from out of his  quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart's blood. Then, before  the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into  the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much  heart, for each feared to suffer the death of his fellow; so presently  they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham  Town.    Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood. Gone was all the joy and  brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within him, and it  was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.    \"Alas!\" cried he, \"thou hast found me an archer that will make thy wife  to wring! I would that thou hadst ne'er said one word to me, or that  I had never passed thy way, or e'en that my right forefinger had been  stricken off ere that this had happened! In haste I smote, but grieve I  sore at leisure!\" And then, even in his trouble, he remembered the old  saw that \"What is done is done; and the egg cracked cannot be cured.\"    And so he came to dwell in the greenwood that was to be his home for  many a year to come, never again to see the happy days with the lads and  lasses of sweet Locksley Town; for he was outlawed, not only because he  had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the King's deer,  and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever  would bring him to the court of the King.    Now the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would bring this  knave Robin Hood to justice, and for two reasons: first, because he  wanted the two hundred pounds, and next, because the forester that Robin  Hood had killed was of kin to him.    But Robin Hood lay hidden in Sherwood Forest for one year, and in that  time there gathered around him many others like himself, cast out from  other folk for this cause and for that. Some had shot deer in hungry  wintertime, when they could get no other food, and had been seen in the  act by the foresters, but had escaped, thus saving their ears; some had  been turned out of their inheritance, that their farms might be added to  the King's lands in Sherwood Forest; some had been despoiled by a great  baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire--all, for one cause or  another, had come to Sherwood to escape wrong and oppression.    So, in all that year, fivescore or more good stout yeomen gathered about  Robin Hood, and chose him to be their leader and chief. Then they vowed  that even as they themselves had been despoiled they would despoil their  oppressors, whether baron, abbot, knight, or squire, and that from each  they would take that which had been wrung from the poor by unjust taxes,  or land rents, or in wrongful fines. But to the poor folk they would  give a helping hand in need and trouble, and would return to them that  which had been unjustly taken from them. Besides this, they swore never  to harm a child nor to wrong a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow; so  that, after a while, when the people began to find that no harm was  meant to them, but that money or food came in time of want to many a  poor family, they came to praise Robin and his merry men, and to tell  many tales of him and of his doings in Sherwood Forest, for they felt  him to be one of themselves.    Up rose Robin Hood one merry morn when all the birds were singing  blithely among the leaves, and up rose all his merry men, each fellow  washing his head and hands in the cold brown brook that leaped laughing  from stone to stone. Then said Robin, \"For fourteen days have we seen no  sport, so now I will go abroad to seek adventures forthwith. But tarry  ye, my merry men all, here in the greenwood; only see that ye mind well  my call. Three blasts upon the bugle horn I will blow in my hour of  need; then come quickly, for I shall want your aid.\"    So saying, he strode away through the leafy forest glades until he  had come to the verge of Sherwood. There he wandered for a long time,  through highway and byway, through dingly dell and forest skirts. Now he  met a fair buxom lass in a shady lane, and each gave the other a merry  word and passed their way; now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad,  to whom he doffed his cap, and who bowed sedately in return to the  fair youth; now he saw a fat monk on a pannier-laden ass; now a gallant  knight, with spear and shield and armor that flashed brightly in the  sunlight; now a page clad in crimson; and now a stout burgher from good  Nottingham Town, pacing along with serious footsteps; all these sights  he saw, but adventure found he none. At last he took a road by the  forest skirts, a bypath that dipped toward a broad, pebbly stream  spanned by a narrow bridge made of a log of wood. As he drew nigh this  bridge he saw a tall stranger coming from the other side. Thereupon  Robin quickened his pace, as did the stranger likewise, each thinking to  cross first.    \"Now stand thou back,\" quoth Robin, \"and let the better man cross  first.\"    \"Nay,\" answered the stranger, \"then stand back shine own self, for the  better man, I wet, am I.\"    \"That will we presently see,\" quoth Robin, \"and meanwhile stand thou  where thou art, or else, by the bright brow of Saint AElfrida, I will  show thee right good Nottingham play with a clothyard shaft betwixt thy  ribs.\"    \"Now,\" quoth the stranger, \"I will tan thy hide till it be as many  colors as a beggar's cloak, if thou darest so much as touch a string of  that same bow that thou holdest in thy hands.\"    \"Thou pratest like an ass,\" said Robin, \"for I could send this shaft  clean through thy proud heart before a curtal friar could say grace over  a roast goose at Michaelmastide.\"    \"And thou pratest like a coward,\" answered the stranger, \"for thou  standest there with a good yew bow to shoot at my heart, while I have  nought in my hand but a plain blackthorn staff wherewith to meet thee.\"    \"Now,\" quoth Robin, \"by the faith of my heart, never have I had a  coward's name in all my life before. I will lay by my trusty bow and  eke my arrows, and if thou darest abide my coming, I will go and cut a  cudgel to test thy manhood withal.\"    \"Ay, marry, that will I abide thy coming, and joyously, too,\" quoth the  stranger; whereupon he leaned sturdily upon his staff to await Robin.    Then Robin Hood stepped quickly to the coverside and cut a good staff of  ground oak, straight, without new, and six feet in length, and came back  trimming away the tender stems from it, while the stranger waited for  him, leaning upon his staff, and whistling as he gazed round about.  Robin observed him furtively as he trimmed his staff, measuring him from  top to toe from out the corner of his eye, and thought that he had never  seen a lustier or a stouter man. Tall was Robin, but taller was the  stranger by a head and a neck, for he was seven feet in height. Broad  was Robin across the shoulders, but broader was the stranger by twice  the breadth of a palm, while he measured at least an ell around the  waist.    \"Nevertheless,\" said Robin to himself, \"I will baste thy hide right  merrily, my good fellow;\" then, aloud, \"Lo, here is my good staff,  lusty and tough. Now wait my coming, an thou darest, and meet me an thou  fearest not. Then we will fight until one or the other of us tumble into  the stream by dint of blows.\"    \"Marry, that meeteth my whole heart!\" cried the stranger, twirling his  staff above his head, betwixt his fingers and thumb, until it whistled  again.    Never did the Knights of Arthur's Round Table meet in a stouter fight  than did these two. In a moment Robin stepped quickly upon the bridge  where the stranger stood; first he made a feint, and then delivered  a blow at the stranger's head that, had it met its mark, would have  tumbled him speedily into the water. But the stranger turned the blow  right deftly and in return gave one as stout, which Robin also turned as  the stranger had done. So they stood, each in his place, neither moving  a finger's-breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given  and received by each in that time, till here and there were sore bones  and bumps, yet neither thought of crying \"Enough,\" nor seemed likely to  fall from off the bridge. Now and then they stopped to rest, and each  thought that he never had seen in all his life before such a hand at  quarterstaff. At last Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that  made his jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun. So shrewd was  the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's-breadth of falling off  the bridge, but he regained himself right quickly and, by a dexterous  blow, gave Robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad with anger and smote with all his might at the  other. But the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked Robin,  and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#2)"],[1,"crowding to the Buytenhof with the  innocent view of merely feasting their eyes with the spectacle; there  were many who went there to play an active part in it, and to take upon  themselves an office which they conceived had been badly filled,--that  of the executioner.    There were, indeed, others with less hostile intentions. All that they  cared for was the spectacle, always so attractive to the mob, whose  instinctive pride is flattered by it,--the sight of greatness hurled  down into the dust.    \"Has not,\" they would say, \"this Cornelius de Witt been locked up and  broken by the rack? Shall we not see him pale, streaming with blood,  covered with shame?\" And was not this a sweet triumph for the burghers  of the Hague, whose envy even beat that of the common rabble; a triumph  in which every honest citizen and townsman might be expected to share?    \"Moreover,\" hinted the Orange agitators interspersed through the crowd,  whom they hoped to manage like a sharp-edged and at the same time  crushing instrument,--\"moreover, will there not, from the Buytenhof to  the gate of the town, a nice little opportunity present itself to throw  some handfuls of dirt, or a few stones, at this Cornelius de Witt, who  not only conferred the dignity of Stadtholder on the Prince of Orange  merely vi coactus, but who also intended to have him assassinated?\"    \"Besides which,\" the fierce enemies of France chimed in, \"if the work  were done well and bravely at the Hague, Cornelius would certainly not  be allowed to go into exile, where he will renew his intrigues with  France, and live with his big scoundrel of a brother, John, on the gold  of the Marquis de Louvois.\"    Being in such a temper, people generally will run rather than walk;  which was the reason why the inhabitants of the Hague were hurrying so  fast towards the Buytenhof.    Honest Tyckelaer, with a heart full of spite and malice, and with no  particular plan settled in his mind, was one of the foremost, being  paraded about by the Orange party like a hero of probity, national  honour, and Christian charity.    This daring miscreant detailed, with all the embellishments and  flourishes suggested by his base mind and his ruffianly imagination, the  attempts which he pretended Cornelius de Witt had made to corrupt him;  the sums of money which were promised, and all the diabolical stratagems  planned beforehand to smooth for him, Tyckelaer, all the difficulties in  the path of murder.    And every phase of his speech, eagerly listened to by the populace,  called forth enthusiastic cheers for the Prince of Orange, and groans  and imprecations of blind fury against the brothers De Witt.    The mob even began to vent its rage by inveighing against the iniquitous  judges, who had allowed such a detestable criminal as the villain  Cornelius to get off so cheaply.    Some of the agitators whispered, \"He will be off, he will escape from  us!\"    Others replied, \"A vessel is waiting for him at Schevening, a French  craft. Tyckelaer has seen her.\"    \"Honest Tyckelaer! Hurrah for Tyckelaer!\" the mob cried in chorus.    \"And let us not forget,\" a voice exclaimed from the crowd, \"that at the  same time with Cornelius his brother John, who is as rascally a traitor  as himself, will likewise make his escape.\"    \"And the two rogues will in France make merry with our money, with the  money for our vessels, our arsenals, and our dockyards, which they have  sold to Louis XIV.\"    \"Well, then, don't let us allow them to depart!\" advised one of the  patriots who had gained the start of the others.    \"Forward to the prison, to the prison!\" echoed the crowd.    Amid these cries, the citizens ran along faster and faster, cocking  their muskets, brandishing their hatchets, and looking death and  defiance in all directions.    No violence, however, had as yet been committed; and the file of  horsemen who were guarding the approaches of the Buytenhof remained  cool, unmoved, silent, much more threatening in their impassibility than  all this crowd of burghers, with their cries, their agitation, and their  threats. The men on their horses, indeed, stood like so many statues,  under the eye of their chief, Count Tilly, the captain of the mounted  troops of the Hague, who had his sword drawn, but held it with its point  downwards, in a line with the straps of his stirrup.    This troop, the only defence of the prison, overawed by its firm  attitude not only the disorderly riotous mass of the populace, but also  the detachment of the burgher guard, which, being placed opposite the  Buytenhof to support the soldiers in keeping order, gave to the rioters  the example of seditious cries, shouting,--    \"Hurrah for Orange! Down with the traitors!\"    The presence of Tilly and his horsemen, indeed, exercised a salutary  check on these civic warriors; but by degrees they waxed more and more  angry by their own shouts, and as they were not able to understand how  any one could have courage without showing it by cries, they attributed  the silence of the dragoons to pusillanimity, and advanced one step  towards the prison, with all the turbulent mob following in their wake.    In this moment, Count Tilly rode forth towards them single-handed,  merely lifting his sword and contracting his brow whilst he addressed  them:--    \"Well, gentlemen of the burgher guard, what are you advancing for, and  what do you wish?\"    The burghers shook their muskets, repeating their cry,--    \"Hurrah for Orange! Death to the traitors!\"    \"'Hurrah for Orange!' all well and good!\" replied Tilly, \"although I  certainly am more partial to happy faces than to gloomy ones. 'Death  to the traitors!' as much of it as you like, as long as you show your  wishes only by cries. But, as to putting them to death in good earnest,  I am here to prevent that, and I shall prevent it.\"    Then, turning round to his men, he gave the word of command,--    \"Soldiers, ready!\"    The troopers obeyed orders with a precision which immediately caused  the burgher guard and the people to fall back, in a degree of confusion  which excited the smile of the cavalry officer.    \"Holloa!\" he exclaimed, with that bantering tone which is peculiar to  men of his profession; \"be easy, gentlemen, my soldiers will not fire a  shot; but, on the other hand, you will not advance by one step towards  the prison.\"    \"And do you know, sir, that we have muskets?\" roared the commandant of  the burghers.    \"I must know it, by Jove, you have made them glitter enough before my  eyes; but I beg you to observe also that we on our side have pistols,  that the pistol carries admirably to a distance of fifty yards, and that  you are only twenty-five from us.\"    \"Death to the traitors!\" cried the exasperated burghers.    \"Go along with you,\" growled the officer, \"you always cry the same thing  over again. It is very tiresome.\"    With this, he took his post at the head of his troops, whilst the tumult  grew fiercer and fiercer about the Buytenhof.    And yet the fuming crowd did not know that, at that very moment when  they were tracking the scent of one of their victims, the other, as  if hurrying to meet his fate, passed, at a distance of not more than a  hundred yards, behind the groups of people and the dragoons, to betake  himself to the Buytenhof.    John de Witt, indeed, had alighted from his coach with his servant, and  quietly walked across the courtyard of the prison.    Mentioning his name to the turnkey, who however knew him, he said,--    \"Good morning, Gryphus; I am coming to take away my brother, who, as you  know, is condemned to exile, and to carry him out of the town.\"    Whereupon the jailer, a sort of bear, trained to lock and unlock the  gates of the prison, had greeted him and admitted him into the building,  the doors of which were immediately closed again.    Ten yards farther on, John de Witt met a lovely young girl, of about  seventeen or eighteen, dressed in the national costume of the Frisian  women, who, with pretty demureness, dropped a curtesy to him. Chucking  her under the chin, he said to her,--    \"Good morning, my good and fair Rosa; how is my brother?\"    \"Oh, Mynheer John!\" the young girl replied, \"I am not afraid of the harm  which has been done to him. That's all over now.\"    \"But what is it you are afraid of?\"    \"I am afraid of the harm which they are going to do to him.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said De Witt, \"you mean to speak of the people down below,  don't you?\"    \"Do you hear them?\"    \"They are indeed in a state of great excitement; but when they see us  perhaps they will grow calmer, as we have never done them anything but  good.\"    \"That's unfortunately no reason, except for the contrary,\" muttered the  girl, as, on an imperative sign from her father, she withdrew.    \"Indeed, child, what you say is only too true.\"    Then, in pursuing his way, he said to himself,--    \"Here is a damsel who very likely does not know how to read, who  consequently has never read anything, and yet with one word she has just  told the whole history of the world.\"    And with the same calm mien, but more melancholy than he had been on  entering the prison, the Grand Pensionary proceeded towards the cell of  his brother.          Chapter 2. The Two Brothers      As the fair Rosa, with foreboding doubt, had foretold, so it happened.  Whilst John de Witt was climbing the narrow winding stairs which led to  the prison of his brother Cornelius, the burghers did their best to have  the troop of Tilly, which was in their way, removed.    Seeing this disposition, King Mob, who fully appreciated the laudable  intentions of his own beloved militia, shouted most lustily,--    \"Hurrah for the burghers!\"    As to Count Tilly, who was as prudent as he was firm, he began to parley  with the burghers, under the protection of the cocked pistols of his  dragoons, explaining to the valiant townsmen, that his order from the  States commanded him to guard the "]]]
