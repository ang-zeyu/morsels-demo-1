And he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great  Emperor of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent  it by a special courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to  send him Don Quixote, for he intended to found a college where the  Spanish tongue would be taught, and it was his wish that the book to be  read should be the History of Don Quixote. He also added that I should go  and be the rector of this college. I asked the bearer if His Majesty had  afforded a sum in aid of my travel expenses. He answered, \"No, not even  in thought.\"    \"Then, brother,\" I replied, \"you can return to your China, post haste or  at whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not fit for so long a  travel and, besides being ill, I am very much without money, while  Emperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples the great  Count of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges and  rectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than I can  wish for.\"    Thus I gave him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering Your  Excellency the \"Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,\" a book I shall finish  within four months, Deo volente, and which will be either the worst or  the best that has been composed in our language, I mean of those intended  for entertainment; at which I repent of having called it the worst, for,  in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the summit of possible  quality. May Your Excellency return in such health that is wished you;  Persiles will be ready to kiss your hand and I your feet, being as I am,  Your Excellency's most humble servant.    From Madrid, this last day of October of the year one thousand six  hundred and fifteen.    At the service of Your Excellency:    MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA          THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE    God bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must  thou be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there  retaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don  Quixote--I mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born  at Tarragona! Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that  satisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in  mine the rule must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him  ass, fool, and malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be  his punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there's an end of it.  What I cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old and  one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over  me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern,  and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the  future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's  eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of those who know  where they were received; for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead  in battle than alive in flight; and so strongly is this my feeling, that  if now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me, I would  rather have had my share in that mighty action, than be free from my  wounds this minute without having been present at it. Those the soldier  shows on his face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven  of honour and ambition of merited praise; and moreover it is to be  observed that it is not with grey hairs that one writes, but with the  understanding, and that commonly improves with years. I take it amiss,  too, that he calls me envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant,  what envy is; for really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only  know that which is holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it  is, I am not likely to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he  holds the rank of familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did  on account of him on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely  mistaken; for I worship the genius of that person, and admire his works  and his unceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to  this gentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are more satirical  than exemplary, but that they are good; for they could not be that unless  there was a little of everything in them.    I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping  myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that  additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that  what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he  does not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but  hides his name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some  lese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, tell him from  me that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what the  temptations of the devil are, and that one of the greatest is putting it  into a man's head that he can write and print a book by which he will get  as much fame as money, and as much money as fame; and to prove it I will  beg of you, in your own sprightly, pleasant way, to tell him this story.    There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities  and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It was this: he  made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog in the street,  or wherever it might be, he with his foot held one of its legs fast, and  with his hand lifted up the other, and as best he could fixed the tube  where, by blowing, he made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in  this position, he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go,  saying to the bystanders (and there were always plenty of them): \"Do your  worships think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?\"--Does  your worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book?    And if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him this  one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.    In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece of  marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when he  came upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight  fall right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking and  howling, would run three streets without stopping. It so happened,  however, that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a  cap-maker's dog, of which his master was very fond. The stone came down  hitting it on the head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw  the affair and was wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at  the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body, and at every  stroke he gave him he said, \"You dog, you thief! my lurcher! Don't you  see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?\" and so, repeating the word  \"lurcher\" again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly. The  madman took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month  never once showed himself in public; but after that he came out again  with his old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came up to where  there was a dog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to let  the stone fall, he said: \"This is a lurcher; ware!\" In short, all the  dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he said were lurchers;  and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be the same with this  historian; that he will not venture another time to discharge the weight  of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder than stones. Tell him,  too, that I do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me of  depriving me of my profit by means of his book; for, to borrow from the  famous interlude of \"The Perendenga,\" I say in answer to him, \"Long life  to my lord the Veintiquatro, and Christ be with us all.\" Long life to the  great Conde de Lemos, whose Christian charity and well-known generosity  support me against all the strokes of my curst fortune; and long life to  the supreme benevolence of His Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de  Sandoval y Rojas; and what matter if there be no printing-presses in the  world, or if they print more books against me than there are letters in  the verses of Mingo Revulgo! These two princes, unsought by any adulation  or flattery of mine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them  to show me kindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier  and richer than if Fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the  ordinary way. The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious;  poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether;  and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it be through  the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of lofty and noble  spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou needst say no more to  him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell thee to bear in  mind that this Second Part of \"Don Quixote\" which I offer thee is cut by  the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First, and that in it I  present thee Don Quixote continued, and at length dead and buried, so  that no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him,  for that already produced is sufficient; and suffice it, too, that some  reputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd  lunacies of his without going into the matter again; for abundance, even  of good things, prevents them from being valued; and scarcity, even in  the case of what is bad, confers a certain value. I was forgetting to  tell thee that thou mayest expect the \"Persiles,\" which I am now  finishing, and also the Second Part of \"Galatea.\"          CHAPTER I.    OF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HIS  MALADY      Cide"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#2)"],[1,"ed.\"    Augmund went home, and when he saw Gunnhillda, he told her how  his errand had ended, and that they would come, and Gunnhillda  said, \"It is only what was to be looked for; for Hrut is said to  be a wise and well-bred man; and now do thou keep a sharp look  out, and tell me as soon as ever they come to the town.\"    Hrut and Auzur went east to the King's Crag, and when they  reached the town, their kinsmen and friends went out to meet and  welcome them.  They asked whether the king were in the town, and  they told them he was.  After that they met Augmund, and he  brought them a greeting from Gunnhillda, saying, that she could  not ask them to her house before they had seen the king, lest men  should say, \"I make too much of them.\"  Still she would do all  she could for them, and she went on, \"Tell Hrut to be out-spoken  before the king, and to ask to be made one of his body-guard;\"  \"and here,\" said Augmund, \"is a dress of honour which she sends  to thee, Hrut, and in it thou must go in before the king.\"  After  that he went away.    The next day Hrut said, \"Let us go before the king.\"    \"That may well be,\" answered Auzur.    So they went, twelve of them together, and all of them friends or  kinsmen, and came into the hall where the king sat over his  drink.  Hrut went first and bade the king \"Good-day,\" and the  king, looking steadfastly at the man who was well-dressed, asked  him his name.  So he told his name.    \"Art thou an Icelander?\" said the king.    He answered, \"Yes.\"    \"What drove thee hither to seek us?\"    Then Hrut answered, \"To see your state, lord; and, besides,  because I have a great matter of inheritance here in the land,  and I shall have need of your help if I am to get my rights.\"    The king said, \"I have given my word that every man shall have  lawful justice here in Norway; but hast thou any other errand in  seeking me?\"    \"Lord!\" said Hrut, \"I wish you to let me live in your court, and  become one of your men.\"    At this the king holds his peace, but Gunnhillda said, \"It seems  to me as if this man offered you the greatest honour, for  methinks if there were many such men in the body-guard, it would  be well filled.\"    \"Is he a wise man?\" asked the king.    \"He is both wise and willing,\" said she.    \"Well,\" said the king, \"methinks my mother wishes that thou  shouldst have the rank for which thou askest, but for the sake of  our honour and the custom of the land, come to me in half a  month's time, and then thou shalt be made one of my body-guard.  Meantime, my mother will take care of thee, but then come to me.\"    Then Gunnhillda said to Augmund, \"Follow them to my house, and  treat them well.\"    So Augmund went out, and they went with him, and he brought them  to a hall built of stone, which was hung with the most beautiful  tapestry, and there too was Gunnhillda's high seat.    Then Augmund said to Hrut, \"Now will be proved the truth of all  that I said to thee from Gunnhillda.  Here is her high seat, and  in it thou shalt sit, and this seat thou shalt hold, though she  comes herself into the hall.\"    After that he made them good cheer, and they had sat down but a  little while when Gunnhillda came in.  Hrut wished to jump up and  greet her.    \"Keep thy seat!\" she says, \"and keep it too all the time thou art  my guest.\"    Then she sat herself down by Hrut, and they fell to drink, and at  even she said, \"Thou shalt be in the upper chamber with me  to-night, and we two together.\"    \"You shall have your way,\" he answers.    After that they went to sleep, and she locked the door inside.  So they slept that night, and in the morning fell to drinking  again.  Thus they spent their life all that halfmonth, and  Gunnhillda said to the men who were there, \"Ye shall lose nothing  except your lives if you say to any one a word of how Hrut and I  are going on.\"    When the half-month was over Hrut gave her a hundred ells of  household woollen and twelve rough cloaks, and Gunnhillda thanked  him for his gifts.  Then Hrut thanked her and gave her a kiss and  went away.  She bade him \"farewell.\"  And next day he went before  the king with thirty men after him and bade the king \"Good-day.\"  The king said, \"Now, Hrut, thou wilt wish me to carry out towards  thee what I promised.\"    So Hrut was made one of the king's body-guard, and he asked,  \"Where shall I sit?\"    \"My mother shall settle that,\" said the king.    Then she got him a seat in the highest room, and he spent the  winter with the king in much honour.        4. OF HRUT'S CRUISE    When the spring came he asked about Soti, and found out he had  gone south to Denmark with the inheritance.  Then Hrut went to  Gunnhillda and tells her what Soti had been about.  Gunnhillda  said, \"I will give thee two long-ships, full manned, and along  with them the bravest man, Wolf the Unwashed, our overseer of  guests; but still go and see the king before thou settest off.\"    Hrut did so; and when he came before the king, then he told the  king of Soti's doings, and how he had a mind to hold on after  him.    The king said, \"What strength has my mother handed over to thee?\"    \"Two long-ships and Wolf the Unwashed to lead the men,\" says  Hrut.    \"Well given,\" says the king.  \"Now I will give thee other two  ships, and even then thou'lt need all the strength thou'st got.\"    After that he went down with Hrut to the ship, and said, \"fare  thee well.\"  Then Hrut sailed away south with his crews.        5. ATLI ARNVID SON'S SLAYING    There was a man named Atli, son of Arnvid, Earl of East Gothland.  He had kept back the taxes from Hacon Athelstane's foster child,  and both father and son had fled away from Jemtland to Gothland.  After that, Atli held on with his followers out of the Maelar by  Stock Sound, and so on towards Denmark, and now he lies out in  Oresound.(1)  He is an outlaw both of the Dane-King and of the  Swede-King.  Hrut held on south to the Sound, and when he came  into it he saw a many ships in the Sound.  Then Wolf said,  \"What's best to be done now, Icelander?\"    \"Hold on our course,\" said Hrut, \"for `nothing venture, nothing  have.'  My ship and Auzur's shall go first, but thou shalt lay  thy ship where thou likest.\"    \"Seldom have I had others as a shield before me,\" says Wolf, and  lays his galley side by side with Hrut's ship; and so they hold  on through the Sound.  Now those who are in the Sound see that  ships are coming up to them, and they tell Atli.    He answered, \"Then may be there'll be gain to be got.\"    After that men took their stand on board each ship; \"but my  ship,\" says Atli, \"shall be in the midst of the fleet.\"    Meantime Hrut's ships ran on, and as soon as either side could  hear the other's hail, Atli stood up and said, \"Ye fare unwarily.  Saw ye not that war-ships were in the Sound.  But what's the name  of your chief?\"    Hrut tells his name.    \"Whose man art thou,\" says Atli.    \"One of king Harold Grayfell's body-guard.\"    Atli said.  \"'Tis long since any love was lost between us, father  and son, and your Norway kings.\"    \"Worse luck for thee,\" says Hrut.    \"Well,\" says Atli, \"the upshot of our meeting will be, that thou  shalt not be left alive to tell the tale;\" and with that he  caught up a spear and hurled it at Hrut's ship, and the man who  stood before it got his death.  After that the battle began, and  they were slow in boarding Hrut's ship.  Wolf, he went well  forward, and with him it was now cut, now thrust.  Atli's  bowman's name was Asolf; he sprung up on Hrut's ship, and was  four men's death before Hrut was aware of him; then he turned  against him, and when they met, Asolf thrust at and through  Hrut's shield, but Hrut cut once at Asolf, and that was his  death-blow.  Wolf the Unwashed saw that stroke, and called out,  \"Truth to say, Hrut, thou dealest big blows, but thou'st much to  thank Gunnhillda for.\"    \"Something tells me,\" says Hrut, \"that thou speakest with a `fey'  mouth.\"    Now Atli sees a bare place for a weapon on Wolf, and shot a spear  through him and now the battle grows hot: Atli leaps up on Hrut's  ship, and clears it fast round about, and now Auzur turns to meet  him, and thrust at him, but fell down full length on his back,  for another man thrust at him.  Now Hrut turns to meet Atli: he  cut at once at Hrut's shield, and clove it all in two, from top  to point; just then Atli got a blow on his hand from a stone, and  down fell his sword.  Hrut caught up the sword, and cut his foot  from under him.  After that he dealt him his death-blow.  There  they took much goods, and brought away with them two ships which  were best, and stayed there only a little while.  But meantime  Soti and his crew had sailed past them, and he held on his course  back to Norway, and made the land at Limgard's side.  There Soti  went on shore, and there he met Augmund, Gunnhillda's page; he  knew him at once, and asks, \"How long meanest thou to be here?\"    \"Three nights,\" says Soti.    \"Whither away, then?\" says Augmund.    \"West, to England,\" says Soti, \"and never to come back again to  Norway while Gunnhillda's rule is in Norway.\"    Augmund went away, and goes and finds Gunnhillda, for she was a  little way off, at a feast, and Gudred, her son, with her.  Augmund told Gunnhillda what Soti meant to do, and she begged  Gudred to take his life.  So Gudred set off at once, and came  unawares on Soti, and made them lead him up the country, and hang  him there.  But the goods he took, and brought them to his  mother, and she got men to carry them all down to the King's  Crag, and after that she went thither herself.    Hrut came back towards autumn, and had gotten great store of  goods.  He went at once to the king, and had a hearty welcome.  He begged them to take whatever they pleased of his goods, and  the king took a third.  Gunnhillda told Hrut how she had got hold  of the inheritance, and had Soti slain.  He thanked her, and gave  her half of all he had."]]]
