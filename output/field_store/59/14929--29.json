There is naturally a        large literature on the Pharisees.  Herford's _Pharisaism_        deserves careful perusal.  See, also, Josephus (ed.        Whiston-Margoliouth), _Antiq._, XIII, 10.6, XVIII, 1, 2-4;        Schurer, _History of the Jews_, etc., II, ii, p. 14 _et seq._;        _Jewish Encyclopedia_ and literature mentioned there; Geiger,        _Judaism and Its History_, p. 102 _et seq._, and Friedlander,        G., _The Jewish Sources of the Sermon on the Mount_, p. 34 _et        seq._                   DESCRIPTION    The _Sayings of the Jewish Fathers_ is the oldest collection of  ethical dicta of the Rabbis of the _Mishnah_ (9).  It is a Rabbinic  anthology.  It has been happily styled \"a compendium of practical  ethics\" (10), and, as Mielziner has said, \"these Rabbinical sentences,  if properly arranged, present an almost complete code of human duties\"  (11).  The _Abot_ is, then, a sort of moral code.          (9) There was another, and apparently older, recension of        _Pirke Abot_ on which is based the _Abot de-Rabbi Natan_, an        _hagadic_ or homiletical exposition of _Abot_.  Two recensions        of _Abot de-Rabbi Natan_ exist, and have been edited by        Schechter.  On this work, see Hoffman, _Die erste Mischna_, p.        26 _et seq._, Mielziner, article _Abot de-Rabbi Natan_, in        _Jewish Encyclopedia_, Strack, _Einleitung_, p. 69 _et seq.,        and Pollak, _Rabbi Nathans System_, etc., _Introduction_, pp.        7-9.  An English translation is found in Rodkinson's edition        of the _Talmud_, vol. V, p. 1 _et seq._          (10) Taylor, _loc. cit._  Lazarus, _Ethics of Judaism_, II.        113, calls it \"a compendium of ethics.\"          (11) In _Jewish Encyclopedia_, art. _Abot_.                   CONTENTS    Even a superficial reading of _Abot_ will bring home to one the fact  that it is made up of various strata.  In fact, it falls naturally  into the following strands or divisions:    A. Chapter I, 1-15: Chronologically arranged sayings of the oldest          authorities, from the men of the Great Synagogue to Hillel          and Shammai.    B. (1) Chapters I, 16-II, 4: Sayings of the men of the school of          Hillel to Rabban Gamaliel (about 230 C.E.), the son of Judah          ha-Nasi       (2) Chapter II, 5-8: Additional sayings of Hillel.    C. (1) Chapter II, 9-19: The sayings of Jochanan ben Zakkai, the          pupil of Hillel, and of his disciples.       (2) Chapter II, 20-21: The sayings of Rabbi Tarfon, a younger          contemporary of Jochanan ben Zakkai.    D. Chapter III: the maxims of seventeen _Tannaim_ (authorities          mentioned in the _Mishnah_) to the time of and including          Rabbi Akiba.  These are not arranged in strictly          chronological order.    E. Chapter IV: The sayings of twenty-five _Tannaim_ after the time          of Rabbi Akiba, who were contemporaries of Rabbi Meir and of          Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi.  These are not chronologically arranged.    F. (1) Chapter V, 1-18: Anonymous sayings forming a series of groups          of ten, seven, and four things, dealing with the creation of          the world, with miracles, and with the varieties of men and          minds.       (2) Chapter V, 19-22: Anonymous sayings touching upon the          varieties of motives and contrasting the good and evil          dispositions.       (3) Chapter V, 23: Sayings of Judah ben Tema.       (4) Chapter V, 24: The ages of man.       (5) Chapter V, 25, 26: The sayings of Ben Bag Bag and of Ben He          He.    G. Chapter VI: The acquisition of the _Torah;_ praise of the          _Torah_.                 LANGUAGE    The language of _Abot_ is easy Mishnaic Hebrew, with portions of four  verses (I, 13; II, 7; V, 25, and V, 26) in Aramaic, which is closely  related to Hebrew.  It is worthy of note that these Aramaic portions  originated with the school of Hillel (12).          (12) On the language of the _Mishnah_, see Mielziner,        _Introduction to the Talmud_, pp. 15-16, and Lauterbach in        _Jewish Encyclopedia_, vol II, p. 614.  On the use of Aramaic        in the _Mishnah_, see Schurer, _History_, I, ii, p. 8 _et        seq._, and Bacher, in _Jewish Encyclopedia_, art. _Aramaic        Language Among the Jews_.  Several centuries before the common        era, Aramaic was the vernacular of the Jews.  Hebrew, however,        remained in use as the sacred language ([lashon ha-kodesh]),        it being the language of the learned, and was employed for        literary, liturgical, and legal purposes.  This accounts for        the Mishnah being written almost entirely in Hebrew, though        Aramaic was spoken on the streets.  It is related of Judah        ha-Nasi that he disliked the Aramaic jargon to such an extent        that he forbade its use in his home, where even the servants        spoke Hebrew with elegance (_Rosh ha-Shanah_, 26b).  When        scholars used Aramaic in his presence, he chided them for not        speaking in Hebrew or in Greek (_Baba Kamma_, 82b).                   DEVELOPMENT OF ABOT (13)          (13) On the subject-matter of this section, consult Hoffmann,        _Die erste Mischna_, pp. 26-37; idem, _Mischnaiot Seder        Nesikin_, _Introd._, pp. XX-XXI; Brull, _Enstehung und        ursprunglicher Inhalt des Traktates Abot;_ Loeb, _La Chaine_,        etc.; Ginzburg, _Spruche der Vater, erstes Capitel historisch        beleuchtet_ (Liepzig, 1889); Strack, _Die Spruche der Vater_,        _Introd._, pp. 7-8; idem, _Einleitung_, p. 52, and Rawicz,        _Commentar des Maimonides_, p. 105, n. 3.    It is apparent from the literary construction of _Abot_ that it has  been edited several times, and that, in its earliest form, the  _Abot_ collection was much smaller than we have it to-day.  Originally,  probably shortly after the time of Hillel, it may have been merely a  sort of appendix to the _Tractate Sanhedrin_, with typical sayings of  each of the heads of the _Sanhedrin_.  These dicta are contained in  what is designated as section A.  Later, presumably by Rabbi Akiba,  there were added to this original kernel of _Abot_ the sayings of  Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai and his most illustrious pupils, which  comprise section C.  This resulted in the grouping together of the  sayings of ten generations of traditional authorities, as follows:  (1) the men of the Great Synagogue, (2) Simon, the Just, (3) Antigonus  of Soko, (4) Jose ben Joezer and Jose ben Jochanan, (5) Joshua ben  Perachiah and Nittai, the Arbelite, (6) Judah ben Tabbai and Simeon  ben Shatach, (7) Shemaiah and Abtalion, (8) Hillel and Shammai, (9)  Jochanan ben Zakkai, and (10) the latter's disciples.  By association  of idea with this number ten, there were added to this collection  numerical sayings of ten, and, then, others of seven and four, found  in chapter V, 1-9 and 10-13.    Into this enlarged kernel of pithy sayings of the oldest authorities,  which may be characterized as the _Abot of Rabbi Akiba_, later  _Tannaim_--Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, and others--interpolated  additional sayings of the afore-mentioned Rabbis, and also typical  utterances of their disciples, and of other well-known teachers.  This  accounts for the presence in _Abot_ of the body of maxims of the six  generations of the school of Hillel, designated above as section B 1,  and which was very properly introduce after the aphorisms of Hillel  and of his contemporary, Shammai.  The thread of tradition being  interrupted by this interpolation, it was again taken up by the  introduction of another body of Hillel's sayings (B 2), thus providing  for a natural transition from Hillel to Jochanan ben Zakkai.  Proof of  the fact that section B is an addition is that in the _Abot de-Rabbi  Natan_--which, as has been said above, is based on an older version of  _Abot_ (14)--the sayings of Jochanan ben Zakkai follow immediately  upon those of Shammai.  The sayings of Judah ha-Nasi, the redactor of  the _Mishnah_, and of Rabbi Gamaliel, his son, were undoubtedly added  after the time of Judah.          (14) See _supra_, p. 13, n. 9.    Chapter III contains the sayings of authorities who were the  predecessors of Judah, the first two having lived before the  destruction of the second Temple.  Chapter IV is made up of the dicta  of a number of Rabbis who were contemporaries of Judah.  These two  chapters were, no doubt, inserted by Judah, the redactor of the  _Mishnah_ as we virtually have it to-day.  Evidence that Chapter IV is  an addition to the original _Abot_ is that it has a number of  aphorisms which are repetitions of some found in Chapters I and II.  The greater part of Chapter V, as stated above, was a portion of the  _Abot_ of Rabbi Akiba.    Chapter VI, which is known as _The Chapter on the Acquisition of  Torah_ (_Perek Kinyan Torah_), as _The External Teaching of the Abot_  (_Baraita de-Abot_) (15), as _The Chapter of Rabbi Meir_ (_Perek Rabbi  Meir_) (16), and as _the External Teaching of Rabbi Meir_ (_Baraita  de-Rabbi Meir_), is a supplement of the treatise _Abot_, as is claimed  for it by its superscription, \"the sages taught in the language of the  _Mishnah_,\" a formula generally used in the _Talmud_ to introduce a  _Baraita_.

England and France, July, 1185          CHAPTER I      THE CONQUEST    The battle of the 14th of October, 1066, was decisive of the struggle for  the throne of England, but William of Normandy was in no haste to gather  in the results of the victory which he had won. The judgment of heaven  had been pronounced in the case between him and Harold, and there was no  mistaking the verdict. The Saxon army was routed and flying. It could  hardly rally short of London, but there was no real pursuit. The Normans  spent the night on the battlefield, and William's own tent was pitched on  the hill which the enemy had held, and in the midst of the Saxon wounded,  a position of some danger, against which his friend and adviser, Walter  Giffard, remonstrated in vain. On the next day he fell back with his army  to Hastings. Here he remained five days waiting, the Saxon Chronicle  tells us, for the nation to make known its submission; waiting, it is  more likely, for reinforcements which were coming from Normandy. So keen  a mind as William's probably did not misjudge the situation. With the  only real army against him broken to pieces, with the only leaders around  whom a new army could rally dead, he could afford to wait. He may not  have understood the rallying power of the Saxon soldiery, but he probably  knew very well the character of the public men of England, who were left  alive to head and direct a new resistance. The only candidate for the  throne upon whom all parties could unite was a boy of no pronounced  character and no experience. The leaders of the nobility who should have  stood forth in such a crisis as the natural leaders of the nation were  men who had shown in the clearest way their readiness to sacrifice  England to their personal ambitions or grievances. At the head of the  Church were men of but little higher character and no greater capacity  for leadership, undisguised pluralists who could not avoid the charge of  disregarding in their own selfish interests the laws they were bound to  administer. London, where the greater part of the fugitives had gathered,  could hardly have settled upon the next step to be taken when William  began his advance, five days after the battle. His first objective point  was the great fortress of Dover, which dominated that important  landing-place upon the coast. On the way he stopped to give an example of  what those might expect who made themselves his enemies, by punishing the  town of Romney, which had ventured to beat off with some vigour a body of  Normans, probably one that had tried to land there by mistake.    Dover had been a strong fortress for centuries, perched on its cliffs as  high as an arrow can be shot, says one who may have been present at these  events, and it had been recently strengthened with new work. William  doubtless expected a difficult task, and he was correspondingly pleased  to find the garrison ready to surrender without a blow, an omen even more  promising than the victory he had gained over Harold. If William had  given at Romney an example of what would follow stubborn resistance, he  gave at Dover an example of how he proposed to deal with those who would  submit, not merely in his treatment of the surrendered garrison of the  castle, but in his payment of the losses of the citizens; for his army,  disappointed of the plunder which would have followed the taking of the  place by force, had burned the town or part of it. At Dover William  remained a week, and here his army was attacked by a foe often more  deadly to the armies of the Middle Ages than the enemies they had come  out to fight. Too much fresh meat and unaccustomed water led to an  outbreak of dysentery which carried off many and weakened others, who had  to be left behind when William set out again. But these losses were  balanced by reinforcements from Normandy, which joined him here or soon  afterwards. His next advance was towards Canterbury, but it had hardly  begun when delegations came up to meet him, bringing the submission of  that city and of other places in Kent. Soon after leaving Dover the duke  himself fell ill, very possibly with the prevailing disease, but if we  may judge by what seems to be our best evidence, he did not allow this to  interrupt his advance, but pushed on towards London with only a brief  stop at any point.[1] Nor is there any certain evidence to be had of  extensive harrying of the country on this march. His army was obliged to  live on what it could take from the inhabitants, and this foraging was  unquestionably accompanied with much unnecessary plundering; but there is  no convincing evidence of any systematic laying waste of large districts  to bring"]]]
