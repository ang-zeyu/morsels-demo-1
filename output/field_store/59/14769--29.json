CHAPTER II. -- ZANZIBAR.    On the morning of the 6th January, 1871, we were sailing through the  channel that separates the fruitful island of Zanzibar from Africa. The  high lands of the continent loomed like a lengthening shadow in the grey  of dawn. The island lay on our left, distant but a mile, coming out  of its shroud of foggy folds bit by bit as the day advanced, until it  finally rose clearly into view, as fair in appearance as the fairest of  the gems of creation. It appeared low, but not flat; there were gentle  elevations cropping hither and yon above the languid but graceful tops  of the cocoa-trees that lined the margin of the island, and there were  depressions visible at agreeable intervals, to indicate where a cool  gloom might be found by those who sought relief from a hot sun. With  the exception of the thin line of sand, over which the sap-green water  rolled itself with a constant murmur and moan, the island seemed buried  under one deep stratum of verdure.    The noble bosom of the strait bore several dhows speeding in and out of  the bay of Zanzibar with bellying sails. Towards the south, above the  sea line of the horizon, there appeared the naked masts of several  large ships, and to the east of these a dense mass of white, flat-topped  houses. This was Zanzibar, the capital of the island;--which soon  resolved itself into a pretty large and compact city, with all the  characteristics of Arab architecture. Above some of the largest houses  lining the bay front of the city streamed the blood-red banner of the  Sultan, Seyd Burghash, and the flags of the American, English, North  German Confederation, and French Consulates. In the harbor were thirteen  large ships, four Zanzibar men-of-war, one English man-of-war--the  'Nymphe,' two American, one French, one Portuguese, two English, and  two German merchantmen, besides numerous dhows hailing from Johanna  and Mayotte of the Comoro Islands, dhows from Muscat and Cutch--traders  between India, the Persian Gulf, and Zanzibar.    It was with the spirit of true hospitality and courtesy that Capt.  Francis R. Webb, United States Consul, (formerly of the United States  Navy), received me. Had this gentleman not rendered me such needful  service, I must have condescended to take board and lodging at a house  known as \"Charley's,\" called after the proprietor, a Frenchman, who has  won considerable local notoriety for harboring penniless itinerants, and  manifesting a kindly spirit always, though hidden under such a rugged  front; or I should have been obliged to pitch my double-clothed American  drill tent on the sandbeach of this tropical island, which was by no  means a desirable thing.    But Capt. Webb's opportune proposal to make his commodious and  comfortable house my own; to enjoy myself, with the request that I would  call for whatever I might require, obviated all unpleasant alternatives.    One day's life at Zanzibar made me thoroughly conscious of my ignorance  respecting African people and things in general. I imagined I had read  Burton and Speke through, fairly well, and that consequently I had  penetrated the meaning, the full importance and grandeur, of the work I  was about to be engaged upon. But my estimates, for instance, based upon  book information, were simply ridiculous, fanciful images of African  attractions were soon dissipated, anticipated pleasures vanished, and  all crude ideas began to resolve themselves into shape.    I strolled through the city. My general impressions are of crooked,  narrow lanes, white-washed houses, mortar-plastered streets, in the  clean quarter;--of seeing alcoves on each side, with deep recesses,  with a fore-ground of red-turbaned Banyans, and a back-ground of flimsy  cottons, prints, calicoes, domestics and what not; or of floors crowded  with ivory tusks; or of dark corners with a pile of unginned and loose  cotton; or of stores of crockery, nails, cheap Brummagem ware, tools,  &c., in what I call the Banyan quarter;--of streets smelling very  strong--in fact, exceedingly, malodorous, with steaming yellow and  black bodies, and woolly heads, sitting at the doors of miserable huts,  chatting, laughing, bargaining, scolding, with a compound smell of  hides, tar, filth, and vegetable refuse, in the negro quarter;--of  streets lined with tall, solid-looking houses, flat roofed, of great  carved doors with large brass knockers, with baabs sitting cross-legged  watching the dark entrance to their masters' houses; of a shallow  sea-inlet, with some dhows, canoes, boats, an odd steam-tub or two,  leaning over on their sides in a sea of mud which the tide has just left  behind it; of a place called \"M'nazi-Moya,\" \"One Cocoa-tree,\" whither  Europeans wend on evenings with most languid steps, to inhale the sweet  air that glides over the sea, while the day is dying and the red sun is  sinking westward; of a few graves of dead sailors, who paid the forfeit  of their lives upon arrival in this land; of a tall house wherein lives  Dr. Tozer, \"Missionary Bishop of Central Africa,\" and his school of  little Africans; and of many other things, which got together into such  a tangle, that I had to go to sleep, lest I should never be able to  separate the moving images, the Arab from the African; the African from  the Banyan; the Banyan from the Hindi; the Hindi from the European, &c.    Zanzibar is the Bagdad, the Ispahan, the Stamboul, if you like, of East  Africa. It is the great mart which invites the ivory traders from the  African interior. To this market come the gum-copal, the hides, the  orchilla weed, the timber, and the black slaves from Africa. Bagdad had  great silk bazaars, Zanzibar has her ivory bazaars; Bagdad once traded  in jewels, Zanzibar trades in gum-copal; Stamboul imported Circassian  and Georgian slaves; Zanzibar imports black beauties from Uhiyow,  Ugindo, Ugogo, Unyamwezi and Galla.    The same mode of commerce obtains here as in all Mohammedan  countries--nay, the mode was in vogue long before Moses was born. The  Arab never changes. He brought the custom of his forefathers with him  when he came to live on this island. He is as much of an Arab here as  at Muscat or Bagdad; wherever he goes to live he carries with him his  harem, his religion, his long robe, his shirt, his slippers, and his  dagger. If he penetrates Africa, not all the ridicule of the negroes can  make him change his modes of life. Yet the land has not become Oriental;  the Arab has not been able to change the atmosphere. The land is  semi-African in aspect; the city is but semi-Arabian.    To a new-comer into Africa, the Muscat Arabs of Zanzibar are studies.  There is a certain empressement about them which we must admire. They  are mostly all travellers. There are but few of them who have not been  in many dangerous positions, as they penetrated Central Africa in search  of the precious ivory; and their various experiences have given  their features a certain unmistakable air of-self-reliance, or of  self-sufficiency; there is a calm, resolute, defiant, independent air  about them, which wins unconsciously one's respect. The stories that  some of these men could tell, I have often thought, would fill many a  book of thrilling adventures.    For the half-castes I have great contempt. They are neither black nor  white, neither good nor bad, neither to be admired nor hated. They are  all things, at all times; they are always fawning on the great Arabs,  and always cruel to those unfortunates brought under their yoke. If I  saw a miserable, half-starved negro, I was always sure to be told  he belonged to a half-caste. Cringing and hypocritical, cowardly and  debased, treacherous and mean, I have always found him. He seems to be  for ever ready to fall down and worship a rich Arab, but is relentless  to a poor black slave. When he swears most, you may be sure he lies  most, and yet this is the breed which is multiplied most at Zanzibar.    The Banyan is a born trader, the beau-ideal of a sharp money-making man.  Money flows to his pockets as naturally as water down a steep. No pang  of conscience will prevent him from cheating his fellow man. He excels  a Jew, and his only rival in a market is a Parsee; an Arab is a babe to  him. It is worth money to see him labor with all his energy, soul and  body, to get advantage by the smallest fraction of a coin over a native.  Possibly the native has a tusk, and it may weigh a couple of frasilahs,  but, though the scales indicate the weight, and the native declares  solemnly that it must be more than two frasilahs, yet our Banyan will  asseverate and vow that the native knows nothing whatever about it, and  that the scales are wrong; he musters up courage to lift it--it is a  mere song, not much more than a frasilah. \"Come,\" he will say, \"close,  man, take the money and go thy way. Art thou mad?\" If the native  hesitates, he will scream in a fury; he pushes him about, spurns the  ivory with contemptuous indifference,--never was such ado about nothing;  but though he tells the astounded native to be up and going, he never  intends the ivory shall leave his shop.    The Banyans exercise, of all other classes, most influence on the trade  of Central Africa. With the exception of a very few rich Arabs, almost  all other traders are subject to the pains and penalties which usury  imposes. A trader desirous to make a journey into the interior, whether  for slaves or ivory, gum-copal, or orchilla weed, proposes to a Banyan  to advance him $5,000, at 50, 60, or 70 per cent. interest. The Banyan  is safe enough not to lose, whether the speculation the trader is  engaged upon pays or not. An experienced trader seldom loses, or if  he has been unfortunate,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#2)"],[1,"of joy and leaped from his  throne, to resume his wild walk up and down the cavern.    \"That's it, Blug!\" he shouted.  \"That's the idea, General!  I'm King of  the Under World, and my subjects are all miners.  I'll make a secret  tunnel under the desert to the Land of Oz--yes! right up to the Emerald  City--and you will march your armies there and capture the whole  country!\"    \"Softly, softly, your Majesty.  Don't go too fast,\" warned the General.  \"My Nomes are good fighters, but they are not strong enough to conquer  the Emerald City.\"    \"Are you sure?\" asked the King.    \"Absolutely certain, your Majesty.\"    \"Then what am I to do?\"    \"Give up the idea and mind your own business,\" advised the General.  \"You have plenty to do trying to rule your underground kingdom.\"    \"But I want the Magic Belt--and I'm going to have it!\" roared the Nome  King.    \"I'd like to see you get it,\" replied the General, laughing maliciously.    The King was by this time so exasperated that he picked up his scepter,  which had a heavy ball, made from a sapphire, at the end of it, and  threw it with all his force at General Blug.  The sapphire hit the  General upon his forehead and knocked him flat upon the ground, where  he lay motionless.  Then the King rang his gong and told his guards to  drag out the General and throw him away; which they did.    This Nome King was named Roquat the Red, and no one loved him.  He was  a bad man and a powerful monarch, and he had resolved to destroy the  Land of Oz and its magnificent Emerald City, to enslave Princess Ozma  and little Dorothy and all the Oz people, and recover his Magic Belt.  This same Belt had once enabled Roquat the Red to carry out many wicked  plans; but that was before Ozma and her people marched to the  underground cavern and captured it.  The Nome King could not forgive  Dorothy or Princess Ozma, and he had determined to be revenged upon  them.    But they, for their part, did not know they had so dangerous an enemy.  Indeed, Ozma and Dorothy had both almost forgotten that such a person  as the Nome King yet lived under the mountains of the Land of Ev--which  lay just across the deadly desert to the south of the Land of Oz.    An unsuspected enemy is doubly dangerous.        2.  How Uncle Henry Got Into Trouble    Dorothy Gale lived on a farm in Kansas, with her Aunt Em and her Uncle  Henry.  It was not a big farm, nor a very good one, because sometimes  the rain did not come when the crops needed it, and then everything  withered and dried up.  Once a cyclone had carried away Uncle Henry's  house, so that he was obliged to build another; and as he was a poor  man he had to mortgage his farm to get the money to pay for the new  house.  Then his health became bad and he was too feeble to work.  The  doctor ordered him to take a sea voyage and he went to Australia and  took Dorothy with him.  That cost a lot of money, too.    Uncle Henry grew poorer every year, and the crops raised on the farm  only bought food for the family.  Therefore the mortgage could not be  paid.  At last the banker who had loaned him the money said that if he  did not pay on a certain day, his farm would be taken away from him.    This worried Uncle Henry a good deal, for without the farm he would  have no way to earn a living.  He was a good man, and worked in the  field as hard as he could; and Aunt Em did all the housework, with  Dorothy's help.  Yet they did not seem to get along.    This little girl, Dorothy, was like dozens of little girls you know.  She was loving and usually sweet-tempered, and had a round rosy face  and earnest eyes.  Life was a serious thing to Dorothy, and a wonderful  thing, too, for she had encountered more strange adventures in her  short life than many other girls of her age.    Aunt Em once said she thought the fairies must have marked Dorothy at  her birth, because she had wandered into strange places and had always  been protected by some unseen power.  As for Uncle Henry, he thought  his little niece merely a dreamer, as her dead mother had been, for he  could not quite believe all the curious stories Dorothy told them of  the Land of Oz, which she had several times visited.  He did not think  that she tried to deceive her uncle and aunt, but he imagined that she  had dreamed all of those astonishing adventures, and that the dreams  had been so real to her that she had come to believe them true.    Whatever the explanation might be, it was certain that Dorothy had been  absent from her Kansas home for several long periods, always  disappearing unexpectedly, yet always coming back safe and sound, with  amazing tales of where she had been and the unusual people she had met.  Her uncle and aunt listened to her stories eagerly and in spite of  their doubts began to feel that the little girl had gained a lot of  experience and wisdom that were unaccountable in this age, when fairies  are supposed no longer to exist.    Most of Dorothy's stories were about the Land of Oz, with its beautiful  Emerald City and a lovely girl Ruler named Ozma, who was the most  faithful friend of the little Kansas girl.  When Dorothy told about the  riches of this fairy country Uncle Henry would sigh, for he knew that a  single one of the great emeralds that were so common there would pay  all his debts and leave his farm free.  But Dorothy never brought any  jewels home with her, so their poverty became greater every year.    When the banker told Uncle Henry that he must pay the money in thirty  days or leave the farm, the poor man was in despair, as he knew he  could not possibly get the money.  So he told his wife, Aunt Em, of his  trouble, and she first cried a little and then said that they must be  brave and do the best they could, and go away somewhere and try to earn  an honest living.  But they were getting old and feeble and she feared  that they could not take care of Dorothy as well as they had formerly  done.  Probably the little girl would also be obliged to go to work.    They did not tell their niece the sad news for several days, not  wishing to make her unhappy; but one morning the little girl found Aunt  Em softly crying while Uncle Henry tried to comfort her.  Then Dorothy  asked them to tell her what was the matter.    \"We must give up the farm, my dear,\" replied her uncle sadly, \"and  wander away into the world to work for our living.\"    The girl listened quite seriously, for she had not known before how  desperately poor they were.    \"We don't mind for ourselves,\" said her aunt, stroking the little  girl's head tenderly; \"but we love you as if you were our own child,  and we are heart-broken to think that you must also endure poverty, and  work for a living before you have grown big and strong.\"    \"What could I do to earn money?\" asked Dorothy.    \"You might do housework for some one, dear, you are so handy; or  perhaps you could be a nurse-maid to little children.  I'm sure I don't  know exactly what you CAN do to earn money, but if your uncle and I are  able to support you we will do it willingly, and send you to school.  We fear, though, that we shall have much trouble in earning a living  for ourselves.  No one wants to employ old people who are broken down  in health, as we are.\"    Dorothy smiled.    \"Wouldn't it be funny,\" she said, \"for me to do housework in Kansas,  when I'm a Princess in the Land of Oz?\"    \"A Princess!\" they both exclaimed, astonished.    \"Yes; Ozma made me a Princess some time ago, and she has often begged  me to come and live always in the Emerald City,\" said the child.    Her uncle and aunt looked at her in amazement.  Then the man said:    \"Do you suppose you could manage to return to your fairyland, my dear?\"    \"Oh yes,\" replied Dorothy; \"I could do that easily.\"    \"How?\" asked Aunt Em.    \"Ozma sees me every day at four o'clock, in her Magic Picture.  She can  see me wherever I am, no matter what I am doing.  And at that time, if  I make a certain secret sign, she will send for me by means of the  Magic Belt, which I once captured from the Nome King.  Then, in the  wink of an eye, I shall be with Ozma in her palace.\"    The elder people remained silent for some time after Dorothy had  spoken.  Finally, Aunt Em said, with another sigh of regret:    \"If that is the case, Dorothy, perhaps you'd better go and live in the  Emerald City.  It will break our hearts to lose you from our lives, but  you will be so much better off with your fairy friends that it seems  wisest and best for you to go.\"    \"I'm not so sure about that,\" remarked Uncle Henry, shaking his gray  head doubtfully.  \"These things all seem real to Dorothy, I know; but  I'm afraid our little girl won't find her fairyland just what she had  dreamed it to be.  It would make me very unhappy to think that she was  wandering among strangers who might be unkind to her.\"    Dorothy laughed merrily at this speech, and then she became very sober  again, for she could see how all this trouble was worrying her aunt and  uncle, and knew that unless she found a way to help them their future  lives would be quite miserable and unhappy.  She knew that she COULD  help them.  She had thought of a way already.  Yet she did not tell  them at once what it was, because she must ask Ozma's consent before  she would be able to carry out her plans.    So she only said:    \"If you will promise not to worry a bit about me, I'll go to the Land  of Oz this very afternoon.  And I'll make a promise, too; that you  shall both see me again before the day comes when you must leave this  farm.\"    \"The day isn't far away, now,\" her uncle sadly replied.  \"I did not  tell you of our trouble until I was obliged to, dear Dorothy, so the  evil time is near at hand.  But if you are quite sure your fairy  friends will give you a home, it will be best for you to go to them, as  your aunt says.\"    That was why Dorothy went to her little room in the attic that  afternoon, taking with her a small dog"]]]
