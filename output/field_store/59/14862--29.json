The  story is told by a contemporary, whom I have thus rendered:    \"In the spring of the third year of the era of Kennin, the age of  Shinran Shonin was twenty-nine. Driven by the desire for seclusion,  he departed to the monastery of Yoshimizu. For as his day was so  remote from the era of the Lord Buddha, and the endurance of man in  the practice of religious austerity was now weakened, he would fain  seek the one broad, straight way that is now made plain before us,  leaving behind him the more devious and difficult roads in which he  had a long time wandered. For so it was that Honen Shonin, the great  teacher of the Doctrine of the Land of Pure Light, had taught him  plainly of the inmost heart of the Faith, raising up in him the firm  foundation of that teaching. Therefore he certainly received at that  time the true meaning of the Divine Promise of universal salvation,  and attained unto the imperishable faith by which alone the ignorant  can enter into Nirvana without condition or price.    \"From the province of Echigo Shinran passed onward to that of  Hitachi, and entered into seclusion at Inada, that little village of  the region of Kasama. Very lonely was his dwelling, yet many  disciples sought after him, and though the humble door of the  monastery was closed against them, many nobles and lesser persons  thronged into the village. So his hope of spreading abroad the Holy  Teaching was fulfilled and his desire to bring joy to the people was  satisfied. Thus he declared that the revelation vouchsafed to him in  the Temple of Rokkaku by the Bodhisattwa of Pity was indeed made  manifest.\"    It is that revelation which speaks in these Psalms--the love,  aspiration, passion for righteousness and humility which are the  heart of all the great religious utterances of the world.    \"Alas for me, Shinran, the ignorant exile who sinks into the deeps  of the great ocean of human affections, who toils to climb the high  mountains of worldly prosperity, and is neither glad to be with them  who return no more to illusion, nor takes delight in approaching  more nearly to true enlightenment. O the pity of it! O the shame of  it!\"    This cry alternates with the joy of perfect aspiration, and it is  that which keeps these psalms in warm human touch with the  spirituality that is neither of race nor time, but for eternity.    He was sixty-two years of age when he returned from exile to  City-Royal, and though he made it his centre, it was his home no  more. He wandered from place to place, teaching as he went, after  the manner of the Buddhas. At the age of ninety his strength  suddenly failed, and the next day he passed away in perfect peace.    Such were the outward events of his life; his own writings must give  the history of his soul. His teachings to-day are spread far and  wide in the land of his birth, and are an inspiration to millions  within and without its shores. In him was the harmonised spirit of  Buddhism at its highest. Those who can enter into the heart of  Shinran Shonin will have gained understanding of the heart of a  mighty people which is said to be impossible of Western reading, and  yet in its essentials is simple as the heart of a child.

Since He who is Infinite attained unto the Wisdom Supreme, the  long, long ages of ten Kalpas have rolled away.    The Light of His Dharma-Kaya is in this world eyes to the blind.    2. Seek refuge in the True Illumination! For the light of His Wisdom  is infinite.    In all the worlds there is nothing upon which His light shines not.    3. Take refuge in the Light universal.    As the Light of His deliverance is boundless, he who is within it is  freed from the lie of affirmation or denial.    4. Seek refuge in That which is beyond understanding,    For His glory is all-embracing as the air. It shineth and pierceth  all things, and there is nothing hid from the light thereof.    5. Take refuge in the ultimate Strength, for His pure radiance is  above all things. He who perceiveth this Light is set free from the  fetters of Karma.    6. Seek refuge in the World-Honoured.    Since His glorious radiance is above all He is called the Buddha of  Divine Light. And by Him is the darkness of the three worlds  Enlightened.    7. Excellent is the Light of His Wisdom. Therefore is he called the  Buddha of Clear Shining.    He who is within the Light, being washed from the soil of Karma,  shall attain unto the final deliverance.    8. Take refuge in the Mighty Consoler. Wheresoever His mercy shineth  throughout all the worlds, men rejoice in its gladdening light.    9. The darkness of ignorance perisheth before His light. Therefore  is He hailed as the Buddha of Radiant Wisdom. All the Buddhas and  the threefold choir of sages praise Him.    10. His glory shineth for ever and ever. Therefore is He called the  Buddha of Everlasting Light.    Most excellent is the virtue of this light, for he who perceiveth it  is born into Paradise without dissolution of being.    11. The glory of the Infinite is boundless, therefore is He known as  the Buddha of Light Past Comprehension.    All the Buddhas glorify the majesty of His holiness that leadeth all  the earth into His Kingdom.    12. His clear shining transcendeth all revelation, nor can human  speech utter it. Therefore is He named the Buddha of Light  Unspeakable.    All the Buddhas glorify the glory of the Infinite One who is Buddha  through His promise of Light immeasurable.    13. Take refuge in Him who is Holiest of Holy. Sun and moon are  lost in the ocean of His splendour. Therefore is He named that  Infinite in whose radiance Sun and Moon are darkened. Before whose  Divine Power even that Buddha made flesh in India himself faltereth  in ascribing praise to the Majesty of His true glory.    14. Far beyond human numbering are the wise in the high assemblage  of the Infinite One. Therefore let him who would be born into the  Land of Purity seek refuge in the Great Congregation.    15. In Paradise are the Mighty unnumbered, Bodhisattvas ranked in  that hierarchy nearest to the Perfect Enlightenment. Thence are they  made flesh upon earth according to the way of salvation that all  having life might be saved.    16. Take refuge in the ocean-deep Soul Universal.    For the sake of all dwelling in the Ten Regions hath He kept the  fullness of all the Teachings, in His divine and mighty promises.    17. He who is Infinite never resteth, for together with the  Bodhisattvas of Compassion and Pure Reason He laboureth, that the  souls of them that duly receive Him may have salvation, enlightening  them with the light of His mercy.    18. When he who is born into the land of Pure Peace returneth again  into this sinful world, even like unto that Buddha made flesh in  India, he wearieth not in seeking the welfare of all men.    19. Seek refuge in the World-Honoured, for His Divine Power is  Almighty and beyond man's measure, being made perfect in  inconceivable Holiness.    20. The Sravakas, the Bodhisattvas, the Heavenly Beings and Souls in  Paradise, they in whom wisdom is made equal unto beauty, declare  their attributes in order, according to their former birth.    21. Seek refuge in Him in whom all strengths are equal.    Nought is there to compare with the excellent beauty of the Souls in  Paradise, for their being is infinite as space, and far are they  above celestials and mortal man.    22. Whoso would be born into Paradise shall in this life be made one  with those men that return no more unto birth and death.    In that Pure Land is none who hath stood among doubting men, and  none also who hath trusted in his own deeds for Salvation. To this  do all the Buddhas witness.    23. If all having life in the Ten Regions hear this Holiest Name of  Him that is Infinite, and attain unto the true faith, they shall  obtain joy and gladness.    24. For when a man with joy accepteth the sacred vow of Him that is  infinite who saith, \"I will not attain unto perfect Enlightenment  unless in Me shall all the world be made whole,\" at that very time  he shall assuredly be born into Paradise.    25. Seek refuge in the Almighty Spirit.    By the divine might of His promise, by the Infinite One was Paradise  created; yea, and the Souls of men that dwell therein. And there is  nought that may compare with them.    26. Seek refuge in the unutterable Wisdom.    Of His Land of Peace the half cannot be told. Even the word of the  Buddha himself could not utter it.    27. Myriads of happy souls were born, are born and shall be born  into that Land of Purity, not from this world alone, but from the  hidden worlds also, and the Ten Regions.    28. So soon as man heareth the holy name of the Infinite One and  with great gladness praiseth him, he shall attain to the reward of  the holy Treasury of Merit.    29. Go forward, O Valiant Souls, seeking the Law though all the  worlds fall into flame and ruin, for ye shall have passed beyond  birth and death!    30. The innumerable Buddhas praise the triumphant divinity of the  Bringer of Light. To Him do gather the myriad Bodhisattvas,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy — Complete (#2)"],[1,"forays, and  accustomed to bloodshed. Their passions were eager, and, with a little  management on the part of some of their most powerful neighbours, they  could easily be _hounded out,_ to use an expressive Scottish phrase, to  commit violence, of which the wily instigators took the advantage, and  left the ignorant MacGregors an undivided portion of blame and  punishment. This policy of pushing on the fierce clans of the Highlands  and Borders to break the peace of the country, is accounted by the  historian one of the most dangerous practices of his own period, in which  the MacGregors were considered as ready agents.    Notwithstanding these severe denunciations,---which were acted upon in  the same spirit in which they were conceived, some of the clan still  possessed property, and the chief of the name in 1592 is designed  Allaster MacGregor of Glenstrae. He is said to have been a brave and  active man; but, from the tenor of his confession at his death, appears  to have been engaged in many and desperate feuds, one of which finally  proved fatal to himself and many of his followers. This was the  celebrated conflict at Glenfruin, near the southwestern extremity of Loch  Lomond, in the vicinity of which the MacGregors continued to exercise  much authority by the _coir a glaive,_ or right of the strongest, which  we have already mentioned.    There had been a long and bloody feud betwixt the MacGregors and the  Laird of Luss, head of the family of Colquhoun, a powerful race on the  lower part of Loch Lomond. The MacGregors' tradition affirms that the  quarrel began on a very trifling subject. Two of the MacGregors being  benighted, asked shelter in a house belonging to a dependant of the  Colquhouns, and were refused. They then retreated to an out-house, took a  wedder from the fold, killed it, and supped off the carcass, for which  (it is said) they offered payment to the proprietor. The Laird of Luss  seized on the offenders, and, by the summary process which feudal barons  had at their command, had them both condemned and executed. The  MacGregors verify this account of the feud by appealing to a proverb  current amongst them, execrating the hour _(Mult dhu an Carbail ghil)_  that the black wedder with the white tail was ever lambed. To avenge this  quarrel, the Laird of MacGregor assembled his clan, to the number of  three or four hundred men, and marched towards Luss from the banks of  Loch Long, by a pass called _Raid na Gael,_ or the Highlandman's Pass.    Sir Humphrey Colquhoun received early notice of this incursion, and  collected a strong force, more than twice the number of that of the  invaders. He had with him the gentlemen of the name of Buchanan, with the  Grahams, and other gentry of the Lennox, and a party of the citizens of  Dumbarton, under command of Tobias Smollett, a magistrate, or bailie, of  that town, and ancestor of the celebrated author.    The parties met in the valley of Glenfruin, which signifies the Glen of  Sorrow---a name that seemed to anticipate the event of the day, which,  fatal to the conquered party, was at least equally so to the victors, the  \"babe unborn\" of Clan Alpine having reason to repent it. The MacGregors,  somewhat discouraged by the appearance of a force much superior to their  own, were cheered on to the attack by a Seer, or second-sighted person,  who professed that he saw the shrouds of the dead wrapt around their  principal opponents. The clan charged with great fury on the front of the  enemy, while John MacGregor, with a strong party, made an unexpected  attack on the flank. A great part of the Colquhouns' force consisted in  cavalry, which could not act in the boggy ground. They were said to have  disputed the field manfully, but were at length completely routed, and a  merciless slaughter was exercised on the fugitives, of whom betwixt two  and three hundred fell on the field and in the pursuit. If the MacGregors  lost, as is averred, only two men slain in the action, they had slight  provocation for an indiscriminate massacre. It is said that their fury  extended itself to a party of students for clerical orders, who had  imprudently come to see the battle. Some doubt is thrown on this fact,  from the indictment against the chief of the clan Gregor being silent on  the subject, as is the historian Johnston, and a Professor Ross, who  wrote an account of the battle twenty-nine years after it was fought. It  is, however, constantly averred by the tradition of the country, and a  stone where the deed was done is called _Leck-a-Mhinisteir,_ the Minister  or Clerk's Flagstone. The MacGregors, by a tradition which is now found  to be inaccurate, impute this cruel action to the ferocity of a single  man of their tribe, renowned for size and strength, called Dugald, _Ciar  Mhor,_ or the great Mouse-coloured Man. He was MacGregor's  foster-brother, and the chief committed the youths to his charge, with  directions to keep them safely till the affray was over. Whether fearful  of their escape, or incensed by some sarcasms which they threw on his  tribe, or whether out of mere thirst of blood, this savage, while the  other MacGregors were engaged in the pursuit, poniarded his helpless and  defenceless prisoners. When the chieftain, on his return, demanded where  the youths were, the _Ciar_ (pronounced Kiar) _Mhor_ drew out his bloody  dirk, saying in Gaelic, \"Ask that, and God save me!\" The latter words  allude to the exclamation which his victims used when he was murdering  them. It would seem, therefore, that this horrible part of the story is  founded on fact, though the number of the youths so slain is probably  exaggerated in the Lowland accounts. The common people say that the blood  of the Ciar Mhor's victims can never be washed off the stone. When  MacGregor learnt their fate, he expressed the utmost horror at the deed,  and upbraided his foster-brother with having done that which would  occasion the destruction of him and his clan. This supposed homicide was  the ancestor of Rob Roy, and the tribe from which he was descended. He  lies buried at the church of Fortingal, where his sepulchre, covered with  a large stone,* is still shown, and where his great strength and courage  are the theme of many traditions.*    * Note A. The Grey Stone of MacGregor.    ** Note B. Dugald Ciar Mhor.    MacGregor's brother was one of the very few of the tribe who was slain.  He was buried near the field of battle, and the place is marked by a rude  stone, called the Grey Stone of MacGregor.    Sir Humphrey Colquhoun, being well mounted, escaped for the time to the  castle of Banochar, or Benechra. It proved no sure defence, however, for  he was shortly after murdered in a vault of the castle,---the family  annals say by the MacGregors, though other accounts charge the deed upon  the MacFarlanes.    This battle of Glenfruin, and the severity which the victors exercised in  the pursuit, was reported to King James VI. in a manner the most  unfavourable to the clan Gregor, whose general character, being that of  lawless though brave men, could not much avail them in such a case. That  James might fully understand the extent of the slaughter, the widows of  the slain, to the number of eleven score, in deep mourning, riding upon  white palfreys, and each bearing her husband's bloody shirt on a spear,  appeared at Stirling, in presence of a monarch peculiarly accessible to  such sights of fear and sorrow, to demand vengeance for the death of  their husbands, upon those by whom they had been made desolate.    The remedy resorted to was at least as severe as the cruelties which it  was designed to punish. By an Act of the Privy Council, dated 3d April  1603, the name of MacGregor was expressly abolished, and those who had  hitherto borne it were commanded to change it for other surnames, the  pain of death being denounced against those who should call themselves  Gregor or MacGregor, the names of their fathers. Under the same penalty,  all who had been at the conflict of Glenfruin, or accessory to other  marauding parties charged in the act, were prohibited from carrying  weapons, except a pointless knife to eat their victuals. By a subsequent  act of Council, 24th June 1613, death was denounced against any persons  of the tribe formerly called MacGregor, who should presume to assemble in  greater numbers than four. Again, by an Act of Parliament, 1617, chap.  26, these laws were continued, and extended to the rising generation, in  respect that great numbers of the children of those against whom the acts  of Privy Council had been directed, were stated to be then approaching to  maturity, who, if permitted to resume the name of their parents, would  render the clan as strong as it was before.    The execution of those severe acts was chiefly intrusted in the west to  the Earl of Argyle and the powerful clan of Campbell, and to the Earl of  Athole and his followers in the more eastern Highlands of Perthshire. The  MacGregors failed not to resist with the most determined courage; and  many a valley in the West and North Highlands retains memory of the  severe conflicts, in which the proscribed clan sometimes obtained  transient advantages, and always sold their lives dearly. At length the  pride of Allaster MacGregor, the chief of the clan, was so much lowered  by the sufferings of his people, that he resolved to surrender himself to  the Earl of Argyle, with his principal followers, on condition that they  should be sent out of Scotland. If the unfortunate chief's own account be  true, he had more reasons than one for expecting some favour from the  Earl, who had in secret advised and encouraged him to many of the  desperate actions for which he was now called to so severe a reckoning.  But Argyle, as old Birrell expresses himself, kept a Highlandman's  promise with them, fulfilling it to the ear, and breaking it to the  sense. MacGregor was sent under a strong"]]]
