[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#2)"],[1,"    The only signs of activity are to be seen amongst the ducks, who, quacking  clamorously, thrust their heads under and bob up again to shake off the  water with equal energy, as if they repeatedly tried to explore the  mysteries below the surface, and every time, shaking their heads, had to  report, \"Nothing there! Nothing there!\"    The days here drowse all their twelve hours in the sun, and silently sleep  away the other twelve, wrapped in the mantle of darkness. The only thing  you want to do in a place like this is to gaze and gaze on the landscape,  swinging your fancies to and fro, alternately humming a tune and nodding  dreamily, as the mother on a winter's noonday, her back to the sun, rocks  and croons her baby to sleep.          KALIGRAM, 1891.      Yesterday, while I was giving audience to my tenants, five or six boys  made their appearance and stood in a primly proper row before me. Before I  could put any question their spokesman, in the choicest of high-flown  language, started: \"Sire! the grace of the Almighty and the good fortune  of your benighted children have once more brought about your lordship's  auspicious arrival into this locality.\" He went on in this strain for  nearly half an hour. Here and there he would get his lesson wrong, pause,  look up at the sky, correct himself, and then go on again. I gathered that  their school was short of benches and stools. \"For want of these  wood-built seats,\" as he put it, \"we know not where to sit ourselves,  where to seat our revered teachers, or what to offer our most respected  inspector when he comes on a visit.\"    I could hardly repress a smile at this torrent of eloquence gushing from  such a bit of a fellow, which sounded specially out of place here, where  the ryots are given to stating their profoundly vital wants in plain and  direct vernacular, of which even the more unusual words get sadly twisted  out of shape. The clerks and ryots, however, seemed duly impressed, and  likewise envious, as though deploring their parents' omission to endow  them with so splendid a means of appealing to the _Zamindar_.    I interrupted the young orator before he had done, promising to arrange  for the necessary number of benches and stools. Nothing daunted, he  allowed me to have my say, then took up his discourse where he had left  it, finished it to the last word, saluted me profoundly, and marched off  his contingent. He probably would not have minded had I refused to supply  the seats, but after all his trouble in getting it by heart he would have  resented bitterly being robbed of any part of his speech. So, though it  kept more important business waiting, I had to hear him out.          NEARING SHAZADPUR,    _January_ 1891.      We left the little river of Kaligram, sluggish as the circulation in a  dying man, and dropped down the current of a briskly flowing stream which  led to a region where land and water seemed to merge in each other, river  and bank without distinction of garb, like brother and sister in infancy.    The river lost its coating of sliminess, scattered its current in many  directions, and spread out, finally, into a _beel_ (marsh), with here  a patch of grassy land and there a stretch of transparent water, reminding  me of the youth of this globe when through the limitless waters land had  just begun to raise its head, the separate provinces of solid and fluid as  yet undefined.    Round about where we have moored, the bamboo poles of fishermen are  planted. Kites hover ready to snatch up fish from the nets. On the ooze at  the water's edge stand the saintly-looking paddy birds in meditation. All  kinds of waterfowl abound. Patches of weeds float on the water. Here and  there rice-fields, untilled, untended,[1] rise from the moist, clay soil.  Mosquitoes swarm over the still waters....    [Footnote 1: On the rich river-side silt, rice seed is simply scattered  and the harvest reaped when ripe; nothing else has to be done.]    We start again at dawn this morning and pass through Kachikata, where the  waters of the _beel_ find an outlet in a winding channel only six or  seven yards wide, through which they rush swiftly. To get our unwieldy  house-boat through is indeed an adventure. The current hurries it along at  lightning speed, keeping the crew busy using their oars as poles to  prevent the boat being dashed against the banks. We thus come out again  into the open river.    The sky had been heavily clouded, a damp wind blowing, with occasional  showers of rain. The crew were all shivering with cold. Such wet and  gloomy days in the cold weather are eminently disagreeable, and I have  spent a wretched lifeless morning. At two in the afternoon the sun came  out, and since then it has been delightful. The banks are now high and  covered with peaceful groves and the dwellings of men, secluded and full  of beauty.    The river winds in and out, an unknown little stream in the inmost  _zenana_ of Bengal, neither lazy nor fussy; lavishing the wealth of  her affection on both sides, she prattles about common joys and sorrows  and the household news of the village girls, who come for water, and sit  by her side, assiduously rubbing their bodies to a glowing freshness with  their moistened towels.    This evening we have moored our boat in a lonely bend. The sky is clear.  The moon is at its full. Not another boat is to be seen. The moonlight  glimmers on the ripples. Solitude reigns on the banks. The distant village  sleeps, nestling within a thick fringe of trees. The shrill, sustained  chirp of the cicadas is the only sound.          SHAZADPUR,    _February_ 1891.      Just in front of my window, on the other side of the stream, a band of  gypsies have ensconced themselves, putting up bamboo frameworks covered  over with split-bamboo mats and pieces of cloth. There are only three of  these little structures, so low that you cannot stand upright inside.  Their life is lived in the open, and they only creep under these shelters  at night, to sleep huddled together.    That is always the gypsies' way: no home anywhere, no landlord to pay rent  to, wandering about as it pleases them with their children, their pigs,  and a dog or two; and on them the police keep a vigilant eye.    I frequently watch the doings of the family nearest me. They are dark but  good-looking, with fine, strongly-built bodies, like north-west country  folk. Their women are handsome, and have tall, slim, well-knit figures;  and with their free and easy movements, and natural independent airs, they  look to me like swarthy Englishwomen.    The man has just put the cooking-pot on the fire, and is now splitting  bamboos and weaving baskets. The woman first holds up a little mirror to  her face, then puts a deal of pains into wiping and rubbing it, over and  over again, with a moist piece of cloth; and then, the folds of her upper  garment adjusted and tidied, she goes, all spick and span, up to her man  and sits beside him, helping him now and then in his work.    These are truly children of the soil, born on it somewhere, bred by the  wayside, here, there, and everywhere, dying anywhere. Night and day under  the open sky, in the open air, on the bare ground, they lead a unique kind  of life; and yet work, love, children, and household duties--everything is  there.    They are not idle for a moment, but always doing something. Her own  particular task over, one woman plumps herself down behind another, unties  the knot of her hair and cleans and arranges it for her; and whether at  the same time they fall to talking over the domestic affairs of the three  little mat-covered households I cannot say for certain from this distance,  but shrewdly suspect it.    This morning a great disturbance invaded the peaceful gypsy settlement. It  was about half-past eight or nine. They were spreading out over the mat  roofs tattered quilts and sundry other rags, which serve them for beds, in  order to sun and air them. The pigs with their litters, lying in a hollow  all of a heap and looking like a dab of mud, had been routed out by the  two canine members of the family, who fell upon them and sent them roaming  in search of their breakfasts, squealing their annoyance at being  interrupted in enjoyment of the sun after the cold night. I was writing my  letter and absently looking out now and then when the hubbub suddenly  commenced.    I rose and went to the window, and found a crowd gathered round the gypsy  hermitage. A superior-looking personage was flourishing a stick and  indulging in the strongest language. The headman of the gypsies, cowed and  nervous, was apparently trying to offer explanations. I gathered that some  suspicious happenings in the locality had led to this visitation by a  police officer.    The woman, so far, had remained sitting, busily scraping lengths of split  bamboo as serenely as if she had been alone and no sort of row going on.  Suddenly, however, she sprang to her feet, advanced on the police officer,  gesticulated violently with her arms right in his face, and gave him, in  strident tones, a piece of her mind. In the twinkling of an eye  three-quarters of the officer's excitement had subsided; he tried to put  in a word or two of mild protest but did not get a chance, and so departed  crestfallen, a different man.    After he had retreated to a safe distance, he turned and shouted back:  \"All I say is, you'll have to clear out from here!\"    I thought my neighbours opposite would forthwith pack up their mats and  bamboos and move away with their bundles, pigs, and children. But there is  no sign of it yet. They are still nonchalantly engaged in splitting  bamboos, cooking food, or completing a toilet.          SHAZADPUR,    _February_ 1891.      The post office is in a part of our estate office building,--this is very  convenient, for we get our letters as soon as they arrive. Some evenings  the postmaster comes up to have a chat with me. I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#2)"],[1," celebrated in the Odes of Horace: one of the  Epistles is addressed to him; and in another, written to Julius Florus,  an officer with Tiberius, Horace enquires about the learned occupations  of the Imperial cohort.      _Quid studiosa Cohors operum struit?  Hoc quoque curo._    It was from his commerce with the Ancients, as I always think, that  George Buchanan derived his opinion, strange to modern ears, that \"a  great commander must of necessity have all the talents of an author.\"  Velleius Paterculus, who served with Tiberius in his campaigns, tells us  of his firm discipline, and of his kindness to the soldiers.    The Caesars Caius and Lucius, grandsons of Augustus, Marcellus his  nephew, and Drusus the brother of Tiberius, all died: they died young,  rich in promise, the darlings of the Roman People; \"Breves et infaustos  Populi Romani amores;\" and thus, in the procession of events, Tiberius  became the heir. \"The Annals\" open with his accession, and Tacitus has  narrated the vicissitudes of his reign. Velleius Paterculus has written  its happier aspects: he describes how the \"Pax Augusta,\" the \"Roman  Peace,\" delivered every quarter of the world from violence. He  celebrates the return of Justice and prosperity, of order, of mild and  equable taxation, of military discipline and magisterial authority. It  is like the Saturnian Reign, which Virgil sings in the Eclogue \"Pollio.\"  The first action of Tiberius was to canonise his father, and Augustus  was translated to the banquet of the Gods:      _Quos inter Augustus recumbens,    Purpureo bibit ore nectar._    Augustus was his great example; \"he not only called him, but considered  him, divine;\" \"non appelavit eum, sed facit Deum.\" The Latin of  Paterculus is here so elegant and happy, that, for the pleasure of the  learned, I transcribe it: for others, I have already given something  of the sense. \"Revocata in forum fides; submota e foro seditio, ambitio  campo, discordia curia: sepultaeque ac situ obsitae, justitia, aequitas,  industria, civitati, redditae; accessit magistratibus auctoritas,  senatui majestas, judiciis gravitas; compressa theatralis seditio;  recte faciendi, omnibus aut incussa voluntas aut imposita necessitas.  Honorantur recta, prava puniuntur. Suspicit potentem humilis, non timet.  Antecedit, non contemnit, humiliorem potens. Quando annona moderatior?  Quando pax laetior? Diffusa in Orientis Occidentisque tractus, quidquid  meridiano aut septentrione finitur, Pax Augusta, per omnes terrarum  orbis angulos metu servat immunes. Fortuita non civium tantummodo, sed  Urbium damna, Principis munificentia vindicat. Restitutae urbes  Asiae: vindictae ab injuriis magistratuum provinciae. Honor dignis  paratissimus: poena in malos sera, sed aliqua. Superatur aequitate  gratia, ambitio virtute: nam facere recte cives suos, Princeps optimus  faciendo docet; cumque sit imperio maximus, exemplo major est.\"    Tiberius reigned from the year 14, to the year 37. He died in the villa  of Lucullus, and he was buried in the mausoleum of the Caesars. The  manner of his death is variously related: Tacitus gives one account;  Suetonius, another. According to the last writer, he died like George  II., alone, having just risen from his bed; and he was thus found by  his attendants: \"Seneca cum scribit subito vocatis ministris, ac nemine  respondente, consurrexisse; nec procul a lectulo, deficientibus viribus,  concidisse.\" Tiberius was tall, and beautiful. Suetonius tells us of  his great eyes, which could see in the dark; of his broad shoulders,  his martial bearing, and the fine proportion of his limbs: he describes,  too, the unusual strength of his hands and fingers, especially of the  left hand. His health was good; because, from his thirtieth year, he  was his own physician. \"Valetudine prosperrima usus est, tempore quidem  principatus paene toto prope illesa; quamvis a trigesimo aetatis anno  arbitratu eam suo rexerit, sine adjutamento consiliove medicorum.\" The  Emperor Julian describes him \"severe and grim; with a statesman's care,  and a soldier's frankness, curiously mingled:\" this was in his old age.      _Down the pale cheek, long lines of shadow slope;    Which years, and curious thought, and suffering give._    At Rome, is a sculpture of Tiberius; he is represented young, seated,  crowned with rays, exceedingly handsome and majestic: if the figure were  not known to be a Caesar, the beholder would say it was a God.    There is another personage in \"The Annals,\" whose history there is  mutilated, and perhaps dissembled; of whose character my readers may  like to know something more, than Tacitus has told them: I mean Sejanus,  a man always to be remembered; because whatever judgment we may form  about his political career, and on this question the authorities are  divided, yet it is admitted by them all, that he introduced those  reforms among the Praetorian Cohorts, which made them for a long time,  proprietors of the throne, and the disposers of the Imperial office. To  this minister, Paterculus attributes as many virtues as he has bestowed  upon Tiberius: \"a man grave and courteous,\" he says, \"with 'a fine  old-fashioned grace'; leisurely in his ways, retiring, modest; appearing  to be careless, and therefore gaining all his ends; outwardly polite and  quiet, but an eager soul, wary, inscrutable, and vigilant.\" Whatever he  may have been in reality, he was at one time valued by Tiberius. \"The  whole Senate,\" Bacon says, \"dedicated an altar to Friendship as to a  Goddess, in respect of the great Dearness of Friendship between them  two:\" and in the Essay \"Of Friendship,\" Bacon has many deep sentences  about the favourites of Kings, their \"Participes Curarum.\" I would  summon out of \"The Annals,\" that episode of Tiberius imprisoned within  the falling cave, and shielded by Sejanus from the descending roof.  \"Coelo Musa beat:\" Sejanus has propitiated no Muse; and although  something more, than the \"invida taciturnitas\" of the poet, lies heavy  upon his reputation, he shall find no apologist in me. But over against  the hard words of Tacitus, it is only fair to place the commendations  of Paterculus, and even Tacitus remarks, that after the fall of Sejanus,  Tiberius became worse; like Henry VIII., after the fall of Wolsey. Livia  and Sejanus are said by Tacitus, to have restrained the worst passions  of the Emperor. The two best authorities contradict one another; they  differ, as much as our political organs differ, about the characters of  living statesmen: and who are we, to decide absolutely, from a distance  of two thousand years, at our mere caprice, and generally without  sufficient evidence, that one ancient writer is correct; and another,  dishonest or mistaken? This is only less absurd, than to prefer the  groping style and thoughts of a modern pedant, usually a German as  well, to the clear words of an old writer, who may be the sole remaining  authority for the statements we presume to question; or for those  very facts, upon which our reasonings depend. And how easy it is to  misunderstand what we read in ancient histories, to be deceived by the  plainest records, or to put a sinister interpretation upon events, which  in their own time were passed over in silence or officially explained  as harmless! Let me take an illustration, of what I mean, from something  recent. Every one must remember the last hours of the Emperor Frederick:  the avenues to his palace infested by armed men; the gloom and secrecy  within; without, an impatient heir, and the posting to and fro of  messengers. We must own, that the ceremonials of the Prussian Court  departed in a certain measure from the ordinary mild usage of humanity;  but we attributed this to nothing more, than the excitement of a  youthful Emperor, or the irrepressible agitation of German officials.  But if these events should find a place in history, or if the annals of  the Kings of Prussia should be judged worth reading by a distant Age;  who could blame an historian for saying, that these precautions were not  required for the peaceful and innocent devolution of the crown from a  father to his son. Would not our historian be justified, if he referred  to the tumults and intrigues of a Praetorian election; if he compared  these events to the darkest pages in Suetonius, or reminded his  readers of the most criminal narratives in the authors of the \"Augustan  History\"? From Sejanus and the Emperor William, I return once more to  Tiberius; from the present _Kaiser_, to a genuine Caesar.    It is not my purpose here to abridge Tacitus, to mangle his translator,  nor to try and say what is better said in the body of the volume: but  when my readers have made themselves acquainted with Tiberius, they may  be glad to find some discussion about him, as he is presented to us in  \"The Annals\"; and among all the personages of history, I doubt if there  be a more various or more debated character. Mr. Matthew Arnold thus  describes him:      _Cruel, but composed and bland,    Dumb, inscrutable and grand;    So Tiberius might have sat,    Had Tiberius been a cat._    And these verses express the popular belief, with great felicity: I  must leave my readers, to make their own final judgment for themselves.  Whether Tacitus will have helped them to a decision, I cannot guess: he  seems to me, to deepen the mystery of Tiberius. At a first reading, and  upon the surface, he is hostile to the Emperor; there is no doubt, that  he himself remained hostile, and that he wished his readers to take away  a very bad impression: but, as we become familiar with his pages, as  we ponder his words and compare his utterances, we begin to suspect our  previous judgment; another impression steals upon us, and a second, and  a third, until there grows imperceptibly within us a vision of something  different. Out of these dim and floating visions, a clearer image is  gradually formed, with lineaments and features; "]]]
