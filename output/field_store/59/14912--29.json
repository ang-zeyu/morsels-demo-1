In short,  the satirists of the times before, and about the time of, the  Reformation, are continually inveighing against the high-living of  the bishops and clergy; indeed luxury was then carried to such an  extravagant pitch amongst them, that archbishop Cranmer, A. 1541,  found it necessary to bring the secular clergy under some reasonable  regulation in regard to the furnishing of their tables, not excepting  even his own [49].    After this historical deduction of the _Ars coquinaria_, which I  have endeavoured to make as short as possible, it is time to say  something of the Roll which is here given to the public, and the  methods which the Editor has pursued in bringing it to light.    This vellum Roll contains 196 _formulæ_, or recipes, and belonged  once to the earl of Oxford [50]. The late James West esquire bought  it at the Earl's sale, when a part of his MSS were disposed of; and  on the death of the gentleman last mentioned it came into the hands  of my highly-esteemed friend, the present liberal and most  communicative possessor. It is presumed to be one of the most ancient  remains of the kind now in being, rising as high as the reign of king  Richard II. [51]. However, it is far the largest and most copious  collection of any we have; I speak as to those times. To establish  its authenticity, and even to stamp an additional value upon it, it  is the identical Roll which was presented to queen Elizabeth, in the  28th year of her reign, by lord Stafford's heir, as appears from the  following address, or inscription, at the end of it, in his own  hand writing:      'Antiquum hoc monumentum oblatum et missum    est majestati vestræ vicesimo septimo die mensis    Julij, anno regni vestri fælicissimi vicesimo viij ab    humilimo vestro subdito, vestræq majestati fidelissimo    E. Stafford,    Hæres domus subversæ Buckinghamiens.' [52]    The general observations I have to make upon it are these: many  articles, it seems, were in vogue in the fourteenth century, which  are now in a manner obsolete, as cranes, curlews, herons, seals [53],  porpoises, &c. and, on the contrary, we feed on sundry fowls which  are not named either in the Roll, or the Editor's MS. [54] as quails,  rails, teal, woodcocks, snipes, &c. which can scarcely be numbered  among the _small birds_ mentioned 19. 62. 154. [55]. So as to fish,  many species appear at our tables which are not found in the Roll,  trouts, flounders, herrings, &c. [56]. It were easy and obvious to  dilate here on the variations of taste at different periods of time,  and the reader would probably not dislike it; but so many other  particulars demand our attention, that I shall content myself with  observing in general, that whereas a very able _Italian_ critic,  _Latinus Latinius_, passed a sinister and unfavourable censure on  certain seemingly strange medlies, disgusting and preposterous messes,  which we meet with in _Apicius_; Dr. _Lister_ very sensibly replies  to his strictures on that head, 'That these messes are not  immediately to be rejected, because they may be displeasing to some.  _Plutarch_ testifies, that the ancients disliked _pepper_ and the  sour juice of lemons, insomuch that for a long time they only used  these in their wardrobes for the sake of their agreeable scent, and  yet they are the most wholesome of all fruits. The natives of the  _West Indies_ were no less averse to _salt_; and who would believe  that _hops_ should ever have a place in our common beverage [57], and  that we should ever think of qualifying the sweetness of malt,  through good housewifry, by mixing with it a substance so egregiously  bitter? Most of the _American_ fruits are exceedingly odoriferous,  and therefore are very disgusting at first to us _Europeans_: on the  contrary, our fruits appear insipid to them, for want of odour. There  are a thousand instances of things, would we recollect them all,  which though disagreeable to taste are commonly assumed into our  viands; indeed, _custom_ alone reconciles and adopts sauces which are  even nauseous to the palate. _Latinus Latinius_ therefore very  rashly and absurdly blames _Apicius_, on account of certain  preparations which to him, forsooth, were disrelishing.' [58] In  short it is a known maxim, that _de gustibus non est disputandum_;    And so Horace to the same purpose:      'Tres mihi convivæ prope dissentire videntur,    Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.    Quid dem? quid non dem? renuis tu quod jubet alter.    Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus.'                           Hor. II. Epist. ii.    And our Roll sufficiently verifies the old observation of  Martial--_ingeniosa gula est_.    [Addenda: after _ingeniosa gula est_, add, 'The _Italians_ now eat  many things which we think perfect carrion. _Ray_, Trav. p. 362. 406.  The _French_ eat frogs and snails. The _Tartars_ feast on horse-flesh,  the _Chinese_ on dogs, and meer _Savages_ eat every thing.  _Goldsmith_, Hist. of the Earth, &c. II. p. 347, 348. 395. III. p.  297. IV. p. 112. 121, &c.']    Our Cooks again had great regard to the eye, as well as the taste,  in their compositions; _flourishing_ and _strewing_ are not only  common, but even leaves of trees gilded, or silvered, are used for  ornamenting messes, see No. 175 [59]. As to colours, which perhaps  would chiefly take place in suttleties, blood boiled and fried (which  seems to be something singular) was used for dying black, 13. 141.  saffron for yellow, and sanders for red [60]. Alkenet is also used  for colouring [61], and mulberries [62]; amydon makes white, 68; and  turnesole [63] _pownas_ there, but what this colour is the Editor  professes not to know, unless it be intended for another kind of  yellow, and we should read _jownas_, for _jaulnas_, orange-tawney. It  was for the purpose of gratifying the sight that _sotiltees_ were  introduced at the more solemn feasts. Rabelais has comfits of an  hundred colours.    Cury, as was remarked above, was ever reckoned a branch of the Art  Medical; and here I add, that the verb _curare_ signifies equally to  dress victuals [64], as to cure a distemper; that every body has  heard of _Doctor Diet, kitchen physick_, &c. while a numerous band of  medical authors have written _de cibis et alimentis_, and have always  classed diet among the _non-naturals_; so they call them, but with  what propriety they best know. Hence Junius '[Greek: Diaita] Græcis  est victus, ac speciatim certa victus ratio, qualis a _Medicis_ ad  tuendam valetudinem præscribitur [65].' Our Cooks expressly tell us,  in their proem, that their work was compiled 'by assent and avysement  of maisters of phisik and of philosophie that dwellid in his [the  King's] court' where _physik_ is used in the sense of medecine,  _physicus_ being applied to persons prosessing the Art of Healing  long before the 14th century [66], as implying _such_ knowledge and  skill in all kinds of natural substances, constituting the _materia  medica_, as was necessiary for them in practice. At the end of the  Editor's MS. is written this rhyme,      Explicit coquina que est optima medicina [67].    There is much relative to eatables in the _Schola Salernitana_; and  we find it ordered, that a physcian should over-see the young  prince's wet-nurse at every meal, to inspect her meat and drink [68].    But after all the avysement of physicians and philosophers, our  processes do not appear by any means to be well calculated for the  benefit of recipients, but rather inimical to them. Many of them are  so highly seasoned, are such strange and heterogeneous compositions,  meer olios and gallimawfreys, that they seem removed as far as  possible from the intention of contributing to health; indeed the  messes are so redundant and complex, that in regard to herbs, in No.  6, no less than ten are used, where we should now be content with two  or three: and so the sallad, No. 76, consists of no less than 14  ingredients. The physicians appear only to have taken care that  nothing directly noxious was suffered to enter the forms. However, in  the Editor's MS. No. 11, there is a prescription for making a _colys_,  I presume a _cullis_, or Invigorating broth; for which see Dodsley's  Old Plays, vol. II. 124. vol. V. 148. vol. VI. 355. and the several  plays mentioned in a note to the first mentioned passage in the Edit.  1780 [69].    I observe further, in regard to this point, that the quantities of  things are seldom specified [70], but are too much left to the taste  and judgement of the cook, if he should happen to be rash and  inconsiderate, or of a bad and undistinguishing taste, was capable of  doing much harm to the guests, to invalids especially.    Though the cooks at Rome, as has been already noted, were amongst the  lowest slaves, yet it was not so more anciently; Sarah and Rebecca  cook, and so do Patroclus and Automedon in the ninth Iliad. It were  to be wished indeed, that the Reader could be made acquainted with  the names of our _master-cooks_, but it is not in the power of the  Editor to gratify him in that; this, however, he may be assured of,  that as the Art was of consequence in the reign of Richard, a prince  renowned and celebrated in the Roll [71], for the splendor and  elegance of his table, they must have been persons of no  inconsiderable rank: the king's first and second cooks are now  esquires by their office, and there is all the reason in the world to  believe they were of equal dignity heretofore [72]. To say a word of  king _Richard_: he is said in the proeme to have been 'acounted the  best and ryallest vyaund [curioso in eating] of all esten kynges.'  This, however, must rest upon the testimony of our cooks, since it  does not appear otherwise by the suffrage of history, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8106"],[0,"Captain Cook's Journal During His First Voyage Round the World (#2)"],[1,"the Variation  of the compass--i.e., the difference between the direction shown by the  magnetic needle and the true north. He is constantly puzzled by the  discrepancies in these observations made at short intervals. These arose  from the different positions of the ship's head, whereby the iron within  a certain distance of the compass is placed in different positions as  regards the needle working the compass card, the result being that the  needle is attracted from its correct direction in varying degree. This is  known as the Deviation of the compass. The cause of this, and of the laws  which govern it, were only discovered by Captain Flinders in 1805.  Happily for the navigators of those days, little iron entered into the  construction of ships, and the amount of the Deviation was not large,  though enough to cause continual disquiet and wonderment.    Cook's longitudes in this voyage are all given as west of Greenwich, not  divided into east and west, as is usual at this day. The latter system  again has only been adopted universally since his time.    Though Cook himself gives, at the beginning of the Journal, a note of the  method of reckoning days adopted, it may not be amiss to give further  explanation here.    It was the usual custom on board ships to keep what was known as Ship  time--i.e., the day began at noon BEFORE the civil reckoning, in which  the day commences at midnight. Thus, while January 1st, as ordinarily  reckoned, is from midnight to midnight, in ship time it began at noon on  December 31st and ended at noon January 1st, this period being called  January 1st. Hence the peculiarity all through the Journal of the p.m.  coming before the a.m. It results that any events recorded as occurring  in the p.m. of January 1st in the log, would, if translated into the  ordinary system, be given as happening in the p.m. of December 31st;  while occurrences in the a.m. of January 1st would be equally in the a.m.  of January 1st in both systems.    This puzzling mode of keeping the day at sea continued to a late period,  and was common to seamen of all nations.    The astronomical day, again, begins at noon AFTER the midnight at which  the civil day begins, and hence is a whole day later than the ship's day.  This does not enter into Cook's Journal, but one of the logs of the  Endeavour, extant, that of Mr. Green the astronomer, was kept in this  time, and the events of say Thursday, June 24th, of Cook's Journal, are  therein given as happening on Wednesday, June 23rd. These differences of  reckoning have been a fertile source of confusion in dates in many  voyages.    Besides Cook's Journals there are other Journals and Logs of the voyage  extant. Perhaps it may be necessary to state that a Log is the official  document in which the progress of the ship from hour to hour is recorded,  with such official notes as the alteration in sail carried, expenditure  of provisions and stores, etc. A Journal contains this information in a  condensed form, with such observations as the officer keeping it may feel  inclined to insert.    The ship's Log Book of the Endeavour is in the British Museum. Mr. R.M.  Hudson of Sunderland possesses Cook's own log, not autograph however,  presented by Cook to Sir Hugh Palliser, the ancestor of his wife.    The Journals of all the officers of the Endeavour are preserved at the  Public Record Office. There is, however, nothing to be got out of them,  as they are mainly copies one of the other, founded on the ship's log.    The portion of Mr. Molineux's, the Master's, Log that exists (at the  Admiralty) is a most beautifully kept and written document, enriched with  charts and sketches that attest the accuracy of Cook's remark, that he  was a \"young man of good parts.\"    The log kept by Mr. Green, however, does contain a few original remarks,  some of which have been made use of. This book contains a mass of  astronomical observations, and witnesses to the zeal of this gentleman in  his especial duty.    He records in one place, when far away from land, his disgust that the  officers were unwilling to aid him in lunar observations. No doubt they  saw no particular use in them when there was no coast to fix; but there  is ample proof that he received every aid when Cook thought it necessary.    Sufficient charts have been placed in this book to enable the reader to  follow the more interesting parts of the voyage; some being reproductions  of Cook's own charts, others modern publications. In the case of the  coast of East Australia, the coast-line as laid down by Cook, and as now  known, are given side by side for comparison.    It must be understood, that although this book is styled CAPTAIN COOK'S  JOURNAL, he was on this voyage only a Lieutenant in Command, and  therefore only Captain by courtesy.    W.J.L. WHARTON.

CAPTAIN COOK'S life, or the account of so much of it as is recoverable,  has been so often recounted that there is no occasion to insert more in  this publication than is necessary as a reference to the reader, to  enable him to realise the career and character of the man.    Cook's first biographer, Andrew Kippis, wrote in 1788, and his work has  recently been republished.* (* \"A Narrative of the Voyage round the  World, performed by Captain James Cook, with an Account of His Life\" by  A. Kippis, D.D., F.R.S. London: Bickers & Son 1889.)    The latest and best life is by Walter Besant,* (* \"Captain Cook\" by  Walter Besant: \"English Men of Action\" London, Macmillan & Co. 1890.)  whose graceful pen has given us a fascinating, interesting, and, as far  as is possible, complete picture of this great Englishman. Many details  of Cook's private life are lost, but enough has been collected by Mr.  Besant to place our hero vividly before us, and a perusal of his work is  strongly recommended.    Many things in the following sketch are taken from Mr. Besant, to whom I  wish to tender my acknowledgments.    James Cook rose from nearly the lowest ranks. The second son of James  Cook, a Yorkshire labourer, and Grace his wife, he was born on the edge  of the Cleveland Hills on February 27th, 1728, in the little village of  Marton, which lies about four miles south-south-east of Middlesborough,  and five miles west of the well-known hill and landmark, Roseberry  Topping. Eight years later his father removed to Great Ayton, which lies  close under Roseberry Topping.    At the age of thirteen Cook, who, it is recorded, had had some elementary  schooling both at Marton and Great Ayton, was apprenticed to one  Sanderson, a draper and grocer of Staithes, a fishing village on the  coast, about fourteen miles from Ayton and nine north-west of Whitby.    A year later Cook went, or ran away, to sea, shipping at Whitby on board  the Freelove, a collier belonging to the brothers Walker.    In this hard school Cook learnt his sailor duties. No better training  could have been found for his future responsibilities. Here he learnt to  endure the utmost rigours of the sea. Constant fighting with North Sea  gales, bad food, and cramped accommodation, taught him to regard with the  indifference that afterwards distinguished him, all the hardships that he  had to encounter, and led him to endure and persevere where others, less  determined or more easily daunted by difficulties, would have hurried on,  and left their work incomplete.    All details of Cook's life during his thirteen years in the merchant  service are lost: what voyages he made, how he fared, whether he advanced  in general knowledge, all is gone. The only fact known is that in May  1755, when Cook was twenty-seven years of age, and mate of a vessel of  Messrs. Walker, then in the Thames, he, to avoid the press, then active  on account of the outbreak of the war with France, volunteered on board  H.M.S. Eagle, of 60 guns, as an able seaman.    Captain Hugh Palliser, who succeeded to the command of this ship in  October, was certainly Cook's warmest patron, and it would appear that  Cook did work superior to that of an able seaman in the Eagle. Be that as  it may, all that is absolutely known is that that ship took her share of  the fighting at the taking of Louisbourg and elsewhere on the North  American and West Indian"]]]
