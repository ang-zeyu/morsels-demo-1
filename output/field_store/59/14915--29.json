What are you? Who are you? What are you?\" And I began to think:  \"Who am I? What am I?\" and so I spent the whole night thinking about  it.'    \"Why, imagine this is Socrates! 'Know thyself,'\" said my father, telling  the story with great enthusiasm.    In the summer-time my mother's brother, Styopa (Stephen Behrs), who was  studying at the time in the school of jurisprudence, used to come and  stay with us. In the autumn he used to go wolf-hunting with my father  and us, with the borzois, and Agafya Mikhailovna loved him for that.    Styopa's examination was in the spring. Agafya Mikhailovna knew about it  and anxiously waited for the news of whether he had got through.    Once she put up a candle before the eikon and prayed that Styopa might  pass. But at that moment she remembered that her borzois had got out and  had not come back to the kennels again.    \"Saints in heaven! they'll get into some place and worry the cattle and  do a mischief!\" she cried. \"'Lord, let my candle burn for the dogs  to come back quick, and I'll buy another for Stepan Andreyevitch.' No  sooner had I said this to myself than I heard the dogs in the porch  rattling their collars. Thank God! they were back. That's what prayer  can do.\"    Another favorite of Agafya Mikhailovna was a young man, Misha  Stakhovitch, who often stayed with us.    \"See what you have been and done to me, little Countess!\" she said  reproachfully to my sister Tanya: \"you've introduced me to Mikhail  Alexandrovitch, and I've fallen in love with him in my old age, like a  wicked woman!\"    On the fifth of February, her name-day, Agafya Mikhailovna received a  telegram of congratulation from Stakhovitch.    When my father heard of it, he said jokingly to Agafya Mikhailovna:    \"Aren't you ashamed that a man had to trudge two miles through the frost  at night all for the sake of your telegram?\"    \"Trudge, trudge? Angels bore him on their wings. Trudge, indeed! You  get three telegrams from an outlandish Jew woman,\" she growled, \"and  telegrams every day about your Golokhvotika. Never a trudge then; but I  get name-day greetings, and it's trudge!\"    And one could not but acknowledge that she was right. This telegram,  the only one in the whole year that was addressed to the kennels, by  the pleasure it gave Agafya Mikhailovna was far more important of course  than this news or the about a ball given in Moscow in honor of a Jewish  banker's daughter, or about Olga Andreyevna Golokvastovy's arrival at  Yasnaya.    Agafya Mikhailovna died at the beginning of the nineties. There were no  more hounds or sporting dogs at Yasnaya then, but till the end of her  days she gave shelter to a motley collection of mongrels, and tended and  fed them.          THE HOME OF THE TOLSTOYS    I CAN remember the house at Yasnaya Polyana in the condition it was in  the first years after my father's marriage.    It was one of the two-storied wings of the old mansion-house of the  Princes Volkonsky, which my father had sold for pulling down when he was  still a bachelor.    From what my father has told me, I know that the house in which he was  born and spent his youth was a three-storied building with thirty-six  rooms. On the spot where it stood, between the two wings, the remains  of the old stone foundation are still visible in the form of trenches  filled with rubble, and the site is covered with big sixty-year-old  trees that my father himself planted.    When any one asked my father where he was born, he used to point to a  tall larch which grew on the site of the old foundations.    \"Up there where the top of that larch waves,\" he used to say; \"that's  where my mother's room was, where I was born on a leather sofa.\"    My father seldom spoke of his mother, but when he did, it was delightful  to hear him, because the mention of her awoke an unusual strain of  gentleness and tenderness in him. There was such a ring of respectful  affection, so much reverence for her memory, in his words, that we all  looked on her as a sort of saint.    My father remembered his father well, because he was already nine years  old when he died. He loved him, too, and always spoke of him reverently;  but one always felt that his mother's memory, although he had never  known her, was dearer to him, and his love for her far greater than for  his father.    Even to this day I do not exactly know the story of the sale of the old  house. My father never liked talking about it, and for that reason I  could never make up my mind to ask him the details of the transaction. I  only know that the house was sold for five thousand paper rubles [3] by  one of his relatives, who had charge of his affairs by power of attorney  when he was in the Caucasus.    It was said to have been done in order to pay off my father's gambling  debts. That was quite true.    My father himself told me that at one time he was a great card-player,  that he lost large sums of money, and that his financial affairs were  considerably embarrassed.    The only thing about which I am in doubt is whether it was with my  father's knowledge or by his directions that the house was sold, or  whether the relative in question did not exceed his instructions and  decide on the sale of his own initiative.    My father cherished his parents' memory to such an extent, and had such  a warm affection for everything relating to his own childhood, that it  is hard to believe that he would have raised his hand against the house  in which he had been born and brought up and in which his mother had  spent her whole life.    Knowing my father as I do, I think it is highly possible that he wrote  to his relative from the Caucasus, \"Sell something,\" not in the least  expecting that he would sell the house, and that he afterward took the  blame for it on himself. Is that not the reason why he was always so  unwilling to talk about it?    In 1871, when I was five years old, the zala [4] and study were built on  the house.    The walls of the zala were hung with old portraits of ancestors. They  were rather alarming, and I was afraid of them at first; but we got  used to them after a time, and I grew fond of one of them, of my  great-grandfather, Ilya Andreyevitch Tolstoy, because I was told that I  was like him.    Beside him hung the portrait of another great-grandfather, Prince  Nikolai Sergeyevitch Volkonsky, my grandmother's father, with thick,  black eyebrows, a gray wig, and a red kaftan. [5]    This Volkonsky built all the buildings of Yasnaya Polyana. He was a  model squire, intelligent and proud, and enjoyed the great respect of  all the neighborhood.    On the ground floor, under the drawing-room, next to the entrance-hall,  my father built his study. He had a semi-circular niche made in the  wall, and stood a marble bust of his favorite dead brother Nikolai in  it. This bust was made abroad from a death-mask, and my father told us  that it was very like, because it was done by a good sculptor, according  to his own directions.    He had a kind and rather plaintive face. The hair was brushed smooth  like a child's, with the parting on one side. He had no beard or  mustache, and his head was white and very, very clean. My father's  study was divided in two by a partition of big bookshelves, containing  a multitude of all sorts of books. In order to support them, the  shelves were connected by big wooden beams, and between them was a thin  birch-wood door, behind which stood my father's writing-table and his  old-fashioned semicircular arm-chair.    There are portraits of Dickens and Schopenhauer and Fet [6] as a young  man on the walls, too, and the well-known group of writers of the  Sovremennik [7] circle in 1856, with Turgenieff, Ostrovsky, Gontcharof,  Grigorovitch, Druzhinin, and my father, quite young still, without a  beard, and in uniform.    My father used to come out of his bedroom of a morning--it was in a  corner on the top floor--in his dressing-gown, with his beard uncombed  and tumbled together, and go down to dress.    Soon after he would issue from his study fresh and vigorous, in a gray  smock-frock, and would go up into the zala for breakfast. That was our  dejeuner.    When there was nobody staying in the house, he would not stop long in  the drawing-room, but would take his tumbler of tea and carry it off to  his study with him.    But if there were friends and guests with us, he would get into  conversation, become interested, and could not tear himself away.    At last he would go off to his work, and we would disperse, in winter to  the different school-rooms, in summer to the croquet-lawn or somewhere  about the garden. My mother would settle down in the drawing-room to  make some garment for the babies, or to copy out something she had not  finished overnight; and till three or four in the afternoon silence  would reign in the house.    Then my father would come out of his study and go off for his  afternoon's exercise. Sometimes he would take a dog and a gun, sometimes  ride, and sometimes merely go for a walk to the imperial wood.    At five the big bell that hung on the broken bough of an old elm-tree in  front of the house would ring and we would all run to wash our hands and  collect for dinner.    He was very hungry, and ate voraciously of whatever turned up. My mother  would try to stop him, would tell him not to waste all his appetite on  kasha, because there were chops and vegetables to follow. \"You'll have  a bad liver again,\" she would say; but he would pay no attention to  her, and would ask for more and more, until his hunger was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8142"],[0,"The Riot Act (#2)"],[1,"be recovered by action to be brought in any of his  Majesty's courts of record at _Westminster_, (wherein no effoin,  protection or wager of law, or any imparlance shall be allowed) by the  person or persons damnified thereby, against any two or more of the  inhabitants of such hundred, such action for damages to any church or  chapel to be brought in the name of the rector, vicar or curate of such  church or chapel that shall be so damnified, in trust for applying the  damages to be recovered in rebuilding or repairing such church or  chapel; and that judgment being given for the plaintiff or plaintiffs  in such action, the damages so to be recovered shall, at the request of  such plaintiff or plaintiffs, his or their executors or administrators,  be raised and levied on the inhabitants of such hundred, and paid to  such plaintiff or plaintiffs, in such manner and form, and by such ways  and means, as are provided by the statute made in the seven and  twentieth year of the reign of Queen _Elizabeth_, for reimbursing the  person or persons on whom any money recovered against any hundred by  any party robbed, shall be levied: and in case any such church, chapel,  building for religious worship, dwelling-house, barn, stable, or  out-house so damnified, shall be in any city or town that is either a  county of itself, or is not within any hundred, that then such damages  shall and may be recovered by action to be brought in manner aforesaid  (where no effoin, protection or wager of law, or any imparlance shall  be allowed) against two or more inhabitants of such city or town; and  judgment being given for the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action,  the damages so to be recovered shall, at the request of such plaintiff  or plaintiffs, his or their executors or administrators, made to the  justices of the peace of such city or town at any quarter-sessions to  be holden for the said city or town, be raised and levied on the  inhabitants of such city or town, and paid to such plaintiff or  plaintiffs, in such manner and form, and by such ways and means, as are  provided by the said statute made in the seven and twentieth year of  the reign of Queen _Elizabeth_, for reimbursing the person or persons  on whom any money recovered against any hundred by any party robbed,  shall be levied.
