Sometimes, my look returned to the burning sheet of dulling flame, that  was, and yet hid, the sun. At times, I glanced behind me, into the  growing dusk of the great, silent room, with its aeon-carpet of  sleeping dust....    So, I watched through the fleeting ages, lost in soul-wearing thoughts  and wonderings, and possessed with a new weariness.        _XVII_    THE SLOWING ROTATION    It might have been a million years later, that I perceived, beyond  possibility of doubt, that the fiery sheet that lit the world, was  indeed darkening.    Another vast space went by, and the whole enormous flame had sunk to a  deep, copper color. Gradually, it darkened, from copper to copper-red,  and from this, at times, to a deep, heavy, purplish tint, with, in it, a  strange loom of blood.    Although the light was decreasing, I could perceive no diminishment in  the apparent speed of the sun. It still spread itself in that dazzling  veil of speed.    The world, so much of it as I could see, had assumed a dreadful shade  of gloom, as though, in very deed, the last day of the worlds  approached.    The sun was dying; of that there could be little doubt; and still the  earth whirled onward, through space and all the aeons. At this time, I  remember, an extraordinary sense of bewilderment took me. I found  myself, later, wandering, mentally, amid an odd chaos of fragmentary  modern theories and the old Biblical story of the world's ending.    Then, for the first time, there flashed across me, the memory that the  sun, with its system of planets, was, and had been, traveling through  space at an incredible speed. Abruptly, the question rose--_Where?_ For  a very great time, I pondered this matter; but, finally, with a certain  sense of the futility of my puzzlings, I let my thoughts wander to other  things. I grew to wondering, how much longer the house would stand.  Also, I queried, to myself, whether I should be doomed to stay,  bodiless, upon the earth, through the dark-time that I knew was coming.  From these thoughts, I fell again to speculations upon the possible  direction of the sun's journey through space.... And so another great  while passed.    Gradually, as time fled, I began to feel the chill of a great winter.  Then, I remembered that, with the sun dying, the cold must be,  necessarily, extraordinarily intense. Slowly, slowly, as the aeons  slipped into eternity, the earth sank into a heavier and redder gloom.  The dull flame in the firmament took on a deeper tint, very somber  and turbid.    Then, at last, it was borne upon me that there was a change. The fiery,  gloomy curtain of flame that hung quaking overhead, and down away into  the Southern sky, began to thin and contract; and, in it, as one sees  the fast vibrations of a jarred harp-string, I saw once more the  sun-stream quivering, giddily, North and South.    Slowly, the likeness to a sheet of fire, disappeared, and I saw,  plainly, the slowing beat of the sun-stream. Yet, even then, the speed  of its swing was inconceivably swift. And all the time, the brightness  of the fiery arc grew ever duller. Underneath, the world loomed  dimly--an indistinct, ghostly region.    Overhead, the river of flame swayed slower, and even slower; until, at  last, it swung to the North and South in great, ponderous beats, that  lasted through seconds. A long space went by, and now each sway of the  great belt lasted nigh a minute; so that, after a great while, I ceased  to distinguish it as a visible movement; and the streaming fire ran in a  steady river of dull flame, across the deadly-looking sky.    An indefinite period passed, and it seemed that the arc of fire became  less sharply defined. It appeared to me to grow more attenuated, and I  thought blackish streaks showed, occasionally. Presently, as I watched,  the smooth onward-flow ceased; and I was able to perceive that there  came a momentary, but regular, darkening of the world. This grew until,  once more, night descended, in short, but periodic, intervals upon the  wearying earth.    Longer and longer became the nights, and the days equaled them; so  that, at last, the day and the night grew to the duration of seconds in  length, and the sun showed, once more, like an almost invisible,  coppery-red colored ball, within the glowing mistiness of its flight.  Corresponding to the dark lines, showing at times in its trail, there  were now distinctly to be seen on the half-visible sun itself, great,  dark belts.    Year after year flashed into the past, and the days and nights spread  into minutes. The sun had ceased to have the appearance of a tail; and  now rose and set--a tremendous globe of a glowing copper-bronze hue; in  parts ringed with blood-red bands; in others, with the dusky ones, that  I have already mentioned. These circles--both red and black--were of  varying thicknesses. For a time, I was at a loss to account for their  presence. Then it occurred to me, that it was scarcely likely that the  sun would cool evenly all over; and that these markings were due,  probably, to differences in temperature of the various areas; the red  representing those parts where the heat was still fervent, and the black  those portions which were already comparatively cool.    It struck me, as a peculiar thing, that the sun should cool in evenly  defined rings; until I remembered that, possibly, they were but isolated  patches, to which the enormous rotatory speed of the sun had imparted a  belt-like appearance. The sun, itself, was very much greater than the sun  I had known in the old-world days; and, from this, I argued that it was  considerably nearer.    At nights, the moon[6] still showed; but small and remote; and the  light she reflected was so dull and weak that she seemed little more  than the small, dim ghost of the olden moon, that I had known.    Gradually, the days and nights lengthened out, until they equaled a  space somewhat less than one of the old-earth hours; the sun rising and  setting like a great, ruddy bronze disk, crossed with ink-black bars.  About this time, I found myself, able once more, to see the gardens,  with clearness. For the world had now grown very still, and changeless.  Yet, I am not correct in saying, 'gardens'; for there were no  gardens--nothing that I knew or recognized. In place thereof, I looked  out upon a vast plain, stretching away into distance. A little to my  left, there was a low range of hills. Everywhere, there was a uniform,  white covering of snow, in places rising into hummocks and ridges.    It was only now, that I recognized how really great had been the  snowfall. In places it was vastly deep, as was witnessed by a great,  upleaping, wave-shaped hill, away to my right; though it is not  impossible, that this was due, in part, to some rise in the surface of  the ground. Strangely enough, the range of low hills to my  left--already mentioned--was not entirely covered with the universal  snow; instead, I could see their bare, dark sides showing in several  places. And everywhere and always there reigned an incredible  death-silence and desolation. The immutable, awful quiet of a  dying world.    All this time, the days and nights were lengthening, perceptibly.  Already, each day occupied, maybe, some two hours from dawn to dusk. At  night, I had been surprised to find that there were very few stars  overhead, and these small, though of an extraordinary brightness; which  I attributed to the peculiar, but clear, blackness of the nighttime.    Away to the North, I could discern a nebulous sort of mistiness; not  unlike, in appearance, a small portion of the Milky Way. It might have  been an extremely remote star-cluster; or--the thought came to me  suddenly--perhaps it was the sidereal universe that I had known, and now  left far behind, forever--a small, dimly glowing mist of stars, far in  the depths of space.    Still, the days and nights lengthened, slowly. Each time, the sun rose  duller than it had set. And the dark belts increased in breadth.    About this time, there happened a fresh thing. The sun, earth, and sky  were suddenly darkened, and, apparently, blotted out for a brief space.  I had a sense, a certain awareness (I could learn little by sight), that  the earth was enduring a very great fall of snow. Then, in an instant,  the veil that had obscured everything, vanished, and I looked out, once  more. A marvelous sight met my gaze. The hollow in which this house,  with its gardens, stands, was brimmed with snow.[7] It lipped over the  sill of my window. Everywhere, it lay, a great level stretch of white,  which caught and reflected, gloomily, the somber coppery glows of the  dying sun. The world had become a shadowless plain, from horizon  to horizon.    I glanced up at the sun. It shone with an extraordinary, dull  clearness. I saw it, now, as one who, until then, had seen it, only  through a partially obscuring medium. All about it, the sky had become  black, with a clear, deep blackness, frightful in its nearness, and its  unmeasured deep, and its utter unfriendliness. For a great time, I  looked into it, newly, and shaken and fearful. It was so near. Had I  been a child, I might have expressed some of my sensation and distress,  by saying that the sky had lost its roof.    Later, I turned, and peered about me, into the room. Everywhere, it was  covered with a thin shroud of the all-pervading white. I could see it  but dimly, by reason of the somber light that now lit the world. It  appeared to cling to the ruined walls; and the thick, soft dust of the  years, that covered the floor knee-deep, was nowhere visible. The snow  must have blown in through the open framework of the windows. Yet, in no  place had it drifted; but lay everywhere about the great, old room,  smooth and level. Moreover, there had been no wind these many thousand  years. But there was the snow,[8] as I have told.    And all the earth was silent.

I think that I gave it away before it was worn out.\"    The boy once more clapped his hands. \"Oh, I knew it, I knew it. I'll give  mine tomorrow to the man who takes our ashes. Now, won't you please play  the piano for me?\"    \"Assuredly. Choose your tune!\"    He fumbled a bit in the rack and passing some rather good music, he held up  a torn and yellow sheet. \"This is what I want,\" he said.    I had not played it for many years. After a false start or so--for it was  villainously set in four sharps for which I have an aversion--I got through  it. On a second trial I did better.    The boy made no comment. He had sunk down in his chair until he was quite  out of sight. \"Well,\" I said, \"what next?\"    There was no answer.    I arose from the bench and glanced in his direction. \"Hello,\" I cried,  \"what has become of you?\"    The chair was empty. I turned on all the lights. He was nowhere in sight. I  shook the hangings. I looked under my desk, for perhaps the lad was hiding  from me in jest. It was unlikely that he could have passed me to gain the  door, but I listened at the sill for any sound upon the stairs. The hall  was silent. I called without response. Somewhat bewildered I came back to  the hearth. Only a few minutes before, as it seemed, there had been a brisk  fire with a row of orange peel upon the upper log. Now all trace of the  peel was gone and the logs had fallen to a white ash.    I was standing perplexed, when I observed that a little pile of papers lay  on the rug just off the end of my desk as by a careless elbow. At least,  I thought, this impolite fellow has forgotten some of his possessions. It  will serve him right if it is poetry that he wrote upon the hilltop.    I picked up the papers. They were yellow and soiled, and writing was  scrawled upon them. At the top was a date--but it was twenty years old.  I turned to the last sheet. At least I could learn the boy's name. To my  amazement, I saw at the bottom in an old but familiar writing, not the  boy's name, but my own.    I gazed at the chimney bricks and their substance seemed to part before my  eyes. I looked into a world beyond--a fabric of moonlight and hilltop and  the hot fret of youth. Perhaps the boy had only been waiting for the fire  upon the hearth to cool to enter this other world of his restless ambition  and desire.    Reader, if by chance you have the habit of writing--let us confine  ourselves now to sonnets and such airy matter as rides upon the  night--doubtless, you sit sometimes at your desk bare of thoughts. The  juices of your intellect are parched and dry. In such plight, I beg you  not to fall upon your fingers or to draw pictures on your sheet. But most  vehemently, and with such emphasis as I possess, I beg you not to rummage  among your rejected and broken fragments in the hope of recasting a  withered thought to a present mood. Rather, before you sour and curdle,  it is good to put on your hat and take your stupid self abroad."]]]
