Now I understand you used a powder in  your giant cannon that--\"    Mr. Titus paused in his explanation, for at that moment there arose  such a clatter out on the front piazza as effectually to drown  conversation. There was a noise of the hoofs of a horse, the fall of a  heavy body, a tattoo on the porch floor and then came an excited shout:    \"Whoa there! Whoa! Stop! Look out where you're kicking!  Bless my  saddle blanket! Ouch! There I go!\"          Chapter II    Explanations      \"What in the world is that?\" cried Mr. Job Titus, in alarm.    Tom Swift did not answer. Instead he jumped up from his chair and ran  toward the front door. Mr. Titus followed.  They both saw a strange  sight.    Standing on the front porch, which he seemed to occupy completely, was  a large horse, with a saddle twisted underneath him. The animal was  looking about him as calmly as though he always made it a practice to  come up on the front piazza when stopping at a house.    Off to one side, with a crushed hat on the back of his head, with a  coat split up the back, with a broken riding crop in one hand and a  handkerchief in the other, sat a dignified, elderly gentleman.    That is, he would have been dignified had it not been for his position  and condition. No gentleman can look dignified with a split coat and a  crushed hat on, sitting under the nose of a horse on a front piazza,  with his raiment otherwise much disheveled, while he wipes his  scratched and bleeding face with a handkerchief.    \"Bless my--bless my--\" began the elderly gentleman, and he seemed at a  loss what particular portion of his anatomy or that of the horse, to  bless, or what portion of the universe to appeal to, for he ended up  with: \"Bless everything, Tom Swift!\"    \"I heartily agree with you, Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom. \"But what in the  world happened?\"    \"That!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, pointing with his broken crop at the horse  on the piazza. \"I was riding him when he ran away--just as my  motorcycle tried to climb a tree. No more horses for me! I'll stick to  airships,\" and slamming his riding crop down on the porch floor with  such force that the horse started back, Mr. Damon arose, painfully  enough if the contortions on his face and his grunts of pain went for  anything.    \"Let me help you!\" begged Tom, striding forward. \"Mr. Titus, perhaps  you will kindly lead the horse down off the piazza?\"    \"Certainly!\" answered the tunnel contractor. \"Whoa now!\" he called  soothingly, as the steed evinced a disposition to sit down on the side  railing. \"Steady now!\"    The horse finally allowed himself to be led down the broad front steps,  sadly marking them, as well as the floor of the piazza, with his sharp  shoes.    \"Ouch! Oh, my back!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as Tom helped him to stand up.    \"Is it hurt?\" asked Tom, anxiously.    \"No, I've just got what old-fashioned folks call a 'crick' in it,\"  explained the elderly horseman. \"But it feels more like a river than a  'crick.' I'll be all right presently.\"    \"How did it happen?\" asked Tom, as he led his guest toward the hall.  Meanwhile Mr. Titus, wondering what it was all about, had tied the  horse to a post out near the street curb, and had re-entered the  library.    \"I was riding over to see you, Tom, to ask you if you wouldn't go to  South America with me,\" began Mr. Damon, rubbing his leg tenderly.    \"South America?\" cried Tom, with a sudden look at Mr. Titus.    \"Yes, South America. Why, there isn't anything strange in that, is  there? You've been to wilder countries, and farther away than that.\"    \"Yes, I know--it's just a coincidence. Go on.\"    \"Let me get where I can sit down,\" begged Mr. Damon. \"I think that  crick in my back is running down into my legs, Tom. I feel a bit weak.  Let me sit down, and get me a glass of water. I shall be all right  presently.\"    Between them Tom and Mr. Titus assisted the horseman into an easy  chair, and there, under the influence of a cup of hot tea, which Mrs.  Baggert, the housekeeper, insisted on making for him, he said he felt  much better, and would explain the reason for his call which had  culminated in such a sensational manner.    And while Mr. Damon is preparing his explanation I will take just a few  moments to acquaint my new readers with some facts about Tom Swift, and  the previous volumes of this series in which he has played such  prominent parts.    Tom Swift was the son of an inventor, and not only inherited his  father's talents, but had greatly added to them, so that now Tom had a  wonderful reputation.    Mr. Swift was a widower, and he and Tom lived in a big house in  Shopton, New York State, with Mrs. Baggert for a housekeeper. About the  house, from time to time, shops and laboratories had been erected,  until now there was a large and valuable establishment belonging to Tom  and his father.    The first volume of this series is entitled, \"Tom Swift and His Motor  Cycle.\" It was through a motor cycle that Tom became acquainted with  Mr. Wakefield Damon, who lived in a neighboring town. Mr. Damon had  bought the motor cycle for himself, but, as he said, one day in riding  it the machine tried to climb a tree near the Swift house.    The young inventor (for even then he was working on several patents)  ministered to Mr. Damon, who, disgusted with the motor cycle, and  wishing to reward Tom, let the young fellow have the machine.    Tom's career began from that hour. For he learned to ride the motor  cycle, after making some improvements in it, and from then on the youth  had led a busy life. Soon afterward he secured a motor boat and from  that it was but a step to an airship.    The medium of the air having been conquered, Tom again turned his  attention to the water, or rather, under the water, and he and his  father made a submarine. Then he built an electric runabout, the  speediest car on the road.    It was when Ton Swift had occasion to send his wireless message from a  lonely island where he had been shipwrecked that he was able to do Mr.  and Mrs. Nestor a valuable service, and this increased the regard which  Miss Mary Nestor felt for the young inventor, a regard that bid fair,  some day, to ripen into something stronger.    Tom Swift might have made a fortune when he set out to discover the  secret of the diamond makers. But Fate intervened, and soon after that  quest he went to the caves of ice, where he and his friends met with  disaster. In his sky racer Tom broke all records for speed, and when he  went to Africa to rescue a missionary, had it not been for his electric  rifle the tide of battle would have gone against him and his party.    Marvelous, indeed, were the adventures underground, which came to Tom  when he went to look for the city of gold, but the treasure there was  not more valuable than the platinum which Tom sought in dreary Siberia  by means of his air glider.    Tom thought his end had come when he fell into captivity among the  giants; but even that turned out well, and he brought two of the giants  away with him. Koku, one of the two giants, became devotedly attached  to the lad, much to the disgust of Eradicate Sampson, the old negro who  had worked for the Swifts for a generation, and who, with his mule  Boomerang, \"eradicated\" from the place as much dirt as possible.    With his wizard camera Tom did much to advance the cause of science.  His great searchlight was of great help to the United States government  in putting a stop to the Canadian smugglers, while his giant cannon was  a distinct advance in ordnance, not excepting the great German guns  used in the European war.    When Tom perfected his photo telephone the last objection to rendering  telephonic conversation admissible evidence in a law court was done  away with, for by this invention a person was able to see, as well as  to hear, over the telephone wire. One practically stood face to face  with the person, miles away, to whom one was talking.    The volume immediately preceding this present one is called: \"Tom Swift  and His Aerial Warship.\" The young inventor perfected a marvelous  aircraft that was the naval terror of the seas, and many governments,  recognizing what an important part aircraft were going to play in all  future conflicts, were anxious to secure Tom's machine. But he was true  to his own country, though his rivals were nearly successful in their  plots against him.    The Mars, which was the name of Tom's latest craft, proved to be a  great success, and the United States government purchased it. It was  not long after the completion of this transaction that the events  narrated in the first chapter of this book took place.    Mr. Damon and Tom had been firm friends ever since the episode of the  motor cycle, and the eccentric gentleman (who blessed so many things)  often went with Tom on his trips.  Besides Mary Nestor, Tom had other  friends. The one, after Miss Nestor, for whom he cared most (if we  except Mr. Damon) was Ned Newton, who was employed in a Shopton bank.  Ned also had often gone with Tom, though lately, having a better  position, he had less time to spare.    \"Well, do you feel better, Mr. Damon?\" asked Tom, after a bit.    \"Yes, very much, thank you. Bless my pen wiper! but I thought I was  done for when I saw my horse bolt for your front stoop. He rushed up  it, fell down, but, fortunately, I managed to get out of his way,  though the saddle girth slipped. And all I could think of was that my  wife would say: 'I told you so!' for she warned me not to ride this  animal.    \"But he never ran away with me before, and I was in a hurry to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#2)"],[1,"voice.    \"A little one, easily mended,\" Tom answered.    He was about to take off his goggles, but at sight of the man's face a  change came over the countenance of Tom Swift, and he replaced the eye  protectors. Then Tom turned to Mr. Damon, as if to ask a question, but  the stranger came so close, evidently curious to see the aircraft at  close quarters, that the young inventor could not speak without being  overheard.    Tom got out his kit of tools to repair the broken control, and the man  watched him curiously. As he tinkered away, something was stirring  among the past memories of the inventor. A question he asked himself  over and over again was:    \"Where have I seen this man before?  His face is familiar, but I can't  place him. He is associated with something unpleasant. But where have I  seen this man before?\"          Chapter II    Tom's Indifference      \"Did you make this machine yourself?\" asked the stranger of Tom, as the  young inventor worked at the damaged part of his craft.    Mr. Damon had also alighted, taken off his goggles, and was looking  aloft, where the army aircraft were going through various evolutions,  and down below, where the young soldiers were drilling under such  conditions, as far as possible, as they might meet with when some of  their number went \"over the top.\" Mr. Damon was murmuring to himself  such remarks as:    \"Bless my fountain pen! look at that chap turning upside down! Bless my  inkwell!\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" remarked Tom Swift, following the remark of the  man, whose face he was trying to recall. It was not that Tom had not  heard the question, but he was trying to gain time before answering.    \"I asked if you made this machine yourself,\" went on the man, as he  peered about at the Hawk. \"It isn't like any I've ever seen before, and  I know something about airships. It has some new wrinkles on it, and I  thought you might have evolved them yourself. Not that it's an amateur  affair, by any means!\" he added hastily, as if fearing the young  inventor might resent the implication that his machine was a home-made  product.    \"Yes, I originated this,\" answered Tom, as he put a new turn-buckle in  place; \"but I didn't actually construct it--that is, except for some  small parts. It was made in the shop--\"    \"Over at the army construction plant, I presume,\" interrupted the man  quickly, as he motioned toward the big factory, not far from Shopton,  where aircraft for Uncle Sam's Army were being turned out by the  hundreds.    \"Might as well let him think that,\" mused Tom; \"at least until I can  figure out who he is and what he wants.\"    \"This is different from most of those up there,\" and the stranger  pointed toward the circling craft on high. \"A bit more speedy, I guess,  isn't it?\"    \"Well, yes, in a way,\" agreed Tom, who was bending over his craft. He  stole a side look at the man. The face was becoming more and more  familiar, yet something about it puzzled Tom Swift.    \"I've seen him before, and yet he didn't look like that,\" thought the  young inventor. \"It's different, somehow. Now why should my memory play  me a trick like this? Who in the world can he be?\"    Tom straightened up, and tossed a monkey wrench into the tool box.    \"Get everything fixed?\" asked the stranger.    \"I think so,\" and the young inventor tried to make his answer pleasant.  \"It was only a small break, easily fixed.\"    \"Then you'll be on your way again?\"    \"Yes. Are you ready?\" called Tom to Mr. Damon.    \"Bless my timetable, yes! I didn't think you'd start back again so  soon. There's one young fellow up there who has looped the loop three  times, and I expect him to fall any minute.\"    \"Oh, I guess he knows his business,\" Tom said easily.  \"We'll be  getting back now.\"    \"One moment!\" called the man. \"I beg your pardon for troubling you, but  you seem to be a mechanic, and that's just the sort of man I'm looking  for. Are you open to an offer to do some inventive and constructive  work?\"    Tom was on his guard instantly.    \"Well, I can't say that I am,\" he answered. \"I am pretty busy--\"    \"This would pay well,\" went on the man eagerly. \"I am a stranger around  here, but I can furnish satisfactory references. I am in need of a good  mechanic, an inventor as well, who can do what you seem to have done so  well. I had hopes of getting some one at the army plant.\"    \"I guess they're not letting any of their men go,\" said Tom, as Mr.  Damon climbed to his seat in the Hawk.    \"No, I soon found that out. But I thought perhaps you--\"    Tom shook his head.    \"I'm sorry,\" he answered, \"but I'm otherwise engaged, and very busy.\"    \"One moment!\" called the man, as he saw Tom about to start \"Is the  Swift Company plant far from here?\"    Tom felt something like a thrill go through him. There was an  unexpected note in the man's voice. The face of the young inventor  lightened, and the doubts melted away.    \"No, it isn't far,\" Tom answered, shouting to be heard above the  crackling bangs of the motor. And then, as the craft soared into the  air, he cried exultingly:    \"I have it! I know who he is! The scoundrel! His beard fooled me, and  he probably didn't know me with these goggles on. But now I know him!\"    \"Bless my calendar!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What are you talking about?\"    But Tom did not answer, for the reason that just then the Hawk fell  into an \"air pocket,\" and needed all his attention to straighten her  out and get her on a level course again.    And while Tom Swift is thus engaged in speeding his aircraft along the  upper regions toward his home, it will take but a few moments to  acquaint my new readers with something of the history of the young  inventor. Those who have read the previous books in this series need be  told nothing about our hero.    Tom Swift was an inventor of note, as was his father. Mr. Swift was now  quite aged and not in robust health, but he was active at times and  often aided Tom when some knotty point came up.    Tom and his father lived on the outskirts of the town of Shopton, and  near their home were various buildings in which the different machines  and appliances were made. Tom's mother was dead, but Mrs. Baggert, the  housekeeper, was as careful in looking after Tom and his father as any  woman could be.    In addition to these three, the household consisted of Eradicate  Sampson, an aged colored servant, and, it might almost be added, his  mule Boomerang; but Boomerang had manners that, at times, did not make  him a welcome addition to any household. Then there was the giant Koku,  one of two big men Tom had brought back with him from the land where  the young inventor had been held captive for a time.    The first book of this series is called \"Tom Swift and His Motor  Cycle,\" and it was in acquiring possession of that machine that Tom met  his friend Mr. Wakefield Damon, who lived in a neighboring town. Mr.  Damon owned the motor cycle originally, but when it attempted to climb  a tree with him he sold it to Tom.    Tom had many adventures on the machine, and it started him on his  inventive career. From then on he had had a series of surprising  adventures. He had traveled in his motor boat, in an airship, and then  had taken to a submarine. In his electric runabout he showed what the  speediest car on the road could do, and when he sent his wireless  message, the details of which can be found set down in the volume of  that name, Tom saved the castaways of Earthquake Island.    Tom Swift had many other thrilling escapes, one from among the diamond  makers, and another from the caves of ice; and he made the quickest  flight on record in his sky racer.    Tom's wizard camera, his great searchlight, his giant cannon, his photo  telephone, his aerial warship and the big tunnel he helped to dig,  brought him credit, fame, and not a little money. He had not long been  back from an expedition to Honduras, dubbed \"the land of wonders,\" when  he was again busy on some of his many ideas. And it was to get some  relief from his thoughts that he had taken the flight with Mr. Damon on  the day the present story opens.    \"What are you so excited about, Tom?\" asked his friend, as the Hawk  alighted near the shed Back of the young inventor's home. \"Bless my  scarf pin! but any one would think you'd just discovered the true  method of squaring the circle.\"    \"Well, it's almost as good as that, and more practical,\" Tom said, with  a smile, as he motioned to Koku to put away the aircraft \"I know who  that man is, now.\"    \"What man, Tom?\"    \"The one who was questioning me when I was fixing the airship. I kept  puzzling and puzzling as to his identity, and, all at once, it came to  me. Do you know who he is, Mr. Damon?\"    \"No, I can't say that I do, Tom. But, as you say, there was something  vaguely familiar about him. It seemed as if I must have seen him  before, and yet--\"    \"That's just the way it struck me. What would you say if I told you  that man was Blakeson, of Blakeson and Grinder, the rival tunnel  contractors who made such trouble for us?\"    \"You mean down in Peru, Tom?\"    \"Yes.\"    Mr. Damon started in surprise, and then exclaimed:    \"Bless my ear mufflers, Tom, but you're right! That was Blakeson! I  didn't know him with his beard, but that was Blakeson, all right! Bless  my foot-warmer! What do you suppose he is doing around here?\"    \"I don't know, Mr. Damon, but I'd give a good deal to know. It isn't  any good, I'll wager on that. He didn't seem to know me or you,  either--unless he did and didn't let on.  I suppose it was because of  my goggles--and you were gazing up in the air most of the time. I don't  think he knew either of us.\"    \"It didn't seem so, Tom. But what is he doing here? Do you think he is  working at the army camp, or helping make Liberty Motors for the  aircraft that are going to beat the Germans?\"    \"Hardly. He didn't seem to be connected with the camp. He wanted a  mechanic, and hinted that"]]]
