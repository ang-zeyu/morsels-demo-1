An ancient mariner will row you over    In a wee boat, _so_ big.    The fare's two obols.      DIO. Fie! The power two obols have, the whole world through!    How came they thither?      HER. Theseus took them down.    And next you'll see great snakes and savage monsters    In tens of thousands.      DIO. You needn't try to scare me, I'm going to go.      HER. Then weltering seas of filth    And ever-rippling dung: and plunged therein,    Whoso has wronged the stranger here on earth,    Or robbed his boylove of the promised pay,    Or swinged his mother, or profanely smitten    His father's cheek, or sworn an oath forsworn,    Or copied out a speech of Morsimus.      DIO. There too, perdie, should _he_ be plunged, whoe'er    Has danced the sword-dance of Cinesias.      HER. And next the breath of flutes will float around you,    And glorious sunshine, such as ours, you'll see,    And myrtle groves, and happy bands who clap    Their hands in triumph, men and women too.      DIO. And who are they?      HER. The happy mystic bands.      XAN. And I'm the donkey in the mystery show.    But I'll not stand it, not one instant longer.      HER. Who'll tell you everything you want to know.    You'll find them dwelling close beside the road    You are going to travel, just at Pluto's gate.    And fare thee well, my brother.      DIO. And to you Good cheer.      (_To Xan._) Now sirrah, pick you up the traps.      XAN. Before I've put them down?      DIO. And quickly too.      XAN. No, prithee, no; but hire a body, one    They're carrying out, on purpose for the trip.      DIO. If I can't find one?      XAN. Then I'll take them.      DIO. Good. And see! they are carrying out a body now.    Hallo! you there, you deadman, are you willing    To carry down our little traps to Hades?      CORPSE. What are they?      DIO. These.      CORP. Two drachmas for the job?      DIO. Nay, that's too much.      CORP. Out of the pathway, you!      DIO. Beshrew thee, stop: may-be we'll strike a bargain.      CORP. Pay me two drachmas, or it's no use talking.      DIO. One and a half.      CORP. I'd liefer live again!      XAN. How absolute the knave is!    He be hanged! I'll go myself.      DIO. You're the right sort, my man.    Now to the ferry.      CHARON. Yoh, up! lay her to.      XAN. Whatever's that?      DIO. Why, that's the lake, by Zeus,    Whereof he spake, and yon's the ferry-boat.      XAN. Poseidon, yes, and that old fellow's Charon.      DIO. Charon! O welcome, Charon! welcome, Charon.      CHAR. Who's for the Rest from every pain and ill?    Who's for the Lethe's plain? the Donkey-shearings?    Who's for Cerberia? Taenarum? or the Ravens?      DIO. I.      CHAR. Hurry in.      DIO. But where are you going really? In truth to the Ravens?      CHAR. Aye, for your behoof. Step in.      DIO. (_To Xan._) Now, lad.      CHAR. A slave? I take no slave,    Unless he has fought for his bodyrights at sea.      XAN. I couldn't go. I'd got the eye-disease.      CHAR. Then fetch a circuit round about the lake.      XAN. Where must I wait?      CHAR. Beside the Withering stone,    Hard by the Rest.      DIO. You understand?      XAN. Too well. O, what ill omen crost me as I started!      CHAR. (_To DIO._) Sit to the oar. (_Calling._) Who else for the boat?    Be quick.      (_To DIO._) Hi! what are you doing?      DIO. What am I doing? Sitting On to the oar.    You told me to, yourself.      CHAR. Now sit you there, you little Potgut.      DIO. So?      CHAR. Now stretch your arms full length before you.      DIO. So?      CHAR. Come, don't keep fooling; plant your feet, and now    Pull with a will.      DIO. Why, how am _I_ to pull? I'm not an oarsman, seaman,    Salaminian. I can't!      CHAR. You can. Just dip your oar in once,    You'll hear the loveliest timing songs.      DIO. What from?      CHAR. Frog-swans, most wonderful.      DIO. Then give the word.      CHAR. Heave ahoy! heave ahoy!!      FROGS.       Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax!     Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax!     We children of the fountain and the lake     Let us wake     Our full choir-shout, as the flutes are ringing out,     Our symphony of clear-voiced song.     The song we used to love in the Marshland up above,     In praise of DIOnysus to produce,     Of Nysaean DIOnysus, son of Zeus,     When the revel-tipsy throng, all crapulous and gay,     To our precinct reeled along on the holy     Pitcher day.     Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO. O, dear! O dear! now I declare I've got a bump upon my rump.      FR. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO. But you, perchance, don't care.      FR. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO. Hang you, and your ko-axing too! There's nothing but ko-ax with    you.      FR. That is right, Mr. Busybody, right!    For the Muses of the lyre love us well;    And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays;    And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight    For the strong reed's sake which I grow within my lake    To be girdled in his lyre's deep shell.    Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO.        My hands are blistered very sore;      My stern below is sweltering so,      'Twill soon, I know, upturn and roar      Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      O tuneful race, O pray give o'er,      O sing no more.      FR. Ah, no! ah, no! Loud and louder our chant must flow.    Sing if ever ye sang of yore,    When in sunny and glorious days    Through the rushes and marsh-flags springing    On we swept, in the joy of singing    Myriad-divine roundelays.    Or when fleeing the storm, we went    Down to the depths, and our choral song    Wildly raised to a loud and long    Bubble-bursting accompaniment.      FR. and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO. This timing song I take from you.      FR. That's a dreadful thing to do.      DIO. Much more dreadful, if I row    Till I burst myself, I trow.      FR. and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO. Go, hang yourselves; for what care I?      FR. All the same we'll shout and cry,    Stretching all our throats with song,    Shouting, crying, all day long.      FR. and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.      DIO. In this you'll never, never win.      FR. This you shall not beat us in.      DIO. No, nor ye prevail o'er me.    Never! never! I'll my song    Shout, if need be, all day long,    Until I've learned to master your ko-ax.    Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.    I thought I'd put a stop to your ko-ax.      CHAR. Stop! Easy! Take the oar and push her to now pay your fare and    go.      DIO. Here 'tis: two obols. Xanthias! where's Xanthias?    Is it Xanthias there?      XAN. Hoi, hoi!      DIO. Come hither.      XAN. Glad to meet you, master.      DIO. What have you there?      XAN. Nothing but filth and darkness.      DIO. But tell me, did you see the parricides    And perjured folk he mentioned?      XAN. Didn't you?      DIO. Poseidon, yes. Why look! (_pointing to the audience_)    I see them now. What's the next step?      XAN. We'd best be moving on.    This is the spot where Heracles declared    Those savage monsters dwell.      DIO. O hang the fellow.    That's all his bluff: he thought to scare me off,    The jealous dog, knowing my plucky ways.    There's no such swaggerer lives as Heracles.    Why, I'd like nothing better than to achieve    Some bold adventure, worthy of our trip.      XAN. I know you would. Hallo! I hear a noise.      DIO. Where? what?      XAN. Behind us, there.      DIO. Get you behind.      XAN. No, it's in front.      DIO. Get you in front directly.      XAN. And now I see the most ferocious monster.      DIO. O, what's it like?      XAN. Like everything by turns.    Now it's a bull: now it's a mule: and now    The loveliest girl.      DIO. O, where? I'll go and meet her.      XAN. It's ceased to be a girl: it's a dog now.      DIO. It is Empusa!      XAN. Well, its face is all    Ablaze with fire.      DIO. Has it a copper leg?      XAN. A copper leg, yes, one; and one of cow dung.      DIO. O, whither shall I flee?      XAN. O, whither I?      DIO. My priest, protect me, and we'll sup together.      XAN. King Heracles, we're done for.      DIO. O, forbear, Good fellow, call me anything but that.      XAN. Well then, Dionysus.      DIO. O, that's worse again.      XAN. (_To the Spectre_.) Aye, go thy way.    O master, here, come here.      DIO. O, what's up now?      XAN. Take courage; all's serene.    And, like Hegelochus, we now may say    \"Out of the storm there comes a new fine wether.\"    Empusa's gone.      DIO. Swear it.      XAN. By Zeus she is.      DIO. Swear it again.      XAN. By Zeus.      DIO. Again      XAN. By Zeus. O dear, O dear, how pale I grew to see her,    But he, from fright has yellowed me all over.      DIO. Ah me, whence fall these evils on my head?    Who is the god to blame for my destruction?    Air, Zeus's chamber, or the Foot of Time?      (_A flute is played behind the scenes_.)      DIO. Hist!      XAN. What's the matter.      DIO. Didn't you hear it?      XAN. What?      DIO. The breath of flutes.      XAN. Aye, and a whiff of torches    Breathed o'er me too; a very mystic whiff.      DIO. Then crouch we down, and mark what's going on.      CHORUS. (_In the distance_.) O Iacchus! O Iacchus! O Iacchus!      XAN. I have it, master: 'tis those blessed Mystics,    Of whom he told us, sporting hereabouts.    They sing the Iacchus which Diagoras made.      DIO. I think so too: we had better both keep quiet    And so find out exactly what it is.      (_The calling forth of Iacchus_.)      CHOR.        O Iacchus! power excelling, here in stately temple dwelling,      O Iacchus! O Iacchus!      Come to tread this verdant level,      Come to dance in mystic revel,      Come whilst round thy forehead hurtles      Many a wreath of fruitful myrtles,      Come with wild and saucy paces      Mingling in our joyous dance,      Pure and holy, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7999"],[0,"The Bible, King James Version, Complete Contents (#2)"],[1,"aid, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.    01:003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast  done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of  the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the  days of thy life:    01:003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between  thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise  his heel.    01:003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow  and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy  desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.    01:003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the  voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded  thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy  sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;    01:003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and  thou shalt eat the herb of the field;    01:003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou  return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou  art, and unto dust shalt thou return.    01:003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the  mother of all living.    01:003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of  skins, and clothed them.    01:003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of  us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take  also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:    01:003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of  Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.    01:003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the  garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to  keep the way of the tree of life.    01:004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,  and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.    01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of  sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.    01:004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of  the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.    01:004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and  of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his  offering:    01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And  Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.    01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is  thy countenance fallen?    01:004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou  doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his  desire, and thou shalt rule over him.    01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,  when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,  and slew him.    01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And  he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?    01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's  blood crieth unto me from the ground.    01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her  mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;    01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield  unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the  earth.    01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I  can bear.    01:004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the  earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a  vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that  findeth me shall slay me.    01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,  vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon  Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.    01:004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in  the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.    01:004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch:  and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name  of his son, Enoch.    01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and  Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.    01:004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was  Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.    01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in  tents, and of such as have cattle.    01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all  such as handle the harp and organ.    01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every  artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.    01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my  voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a  man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.    01:004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and  sevenfold.    01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called  his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead  of Abel, whom Cain slew.    01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called  his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.    01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that  God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;    01:005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called  their name Adam, in the day when they were created.    01:005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son  in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:    01:005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight  hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:    01:005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty  years: and he died.    01:005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:    01:005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven  years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:  and he died.    01:005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:    01:005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and  fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years:  and he died.    01:005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:    01:005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and  forty years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:  and he died.    01:005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:    01:005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and  thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and  five years: and he died.    01:005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat  Enoch:    01:005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and  begat sons and daughters:    01:005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two  years: and he died.    01:005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:    01:005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three  hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five  years:    01:005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.    01:005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and  begat Lamech.    01:005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred  eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and  nine years: and he died.    01:005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a  son:    01:005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort  us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground  which the LORD hath cursed.    01:005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and  five years, and begat sons and daughters:    01:005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and  seven years: and he died.    01:005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem,  Ham, and Japheth.    01:006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face  of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,    01:006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were  fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.    01:006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with  man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and  twenty years.    01:006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after  that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they  bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men  of renown.    01:006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the  earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only  evil continually.    01:006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,  and it grieved him at his heart.    01:006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created  from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing,  and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.    01:006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.    01:006:009 These are the generations of Noah:"]]]
