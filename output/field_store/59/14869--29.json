Bert assisted his father  with the packing up, for the taking of a whole family to the country  meant lots of clothes, besides some books and just a few toys. Then  there was Bert's tool box--he knew he would need that at Meadow Brook.    The morning came at last, a beautiful bright day, a rare one for  traveling, for a fine shower the evening before had washed and cooled  things off splendidly.    \"Now come, children,\" Mr. Bobbsey told the excited youngsters. \"Keep  track of your things. Sam will be ready in a few minutes, and then we  must be off.\"    Promptly Sam pulled up to the door with the family carriage, and all  hurried to get in.    \"Oh, Snoop, Snoop!\" cried Freddie. \"He's in the library in the box!  Dinah, get him quick, get him!\" and Dinah ran back after the little  kitten.    \"Here you is, Freddie!\" she gasped, out of breath from hurrying. \"You  don't go and forget poor Snoopy!\" and she climbed in beside Sam.    Then they started.    \"Oh, my lan' a-massy!\" yelled Dinah presently in distress. \"Sam  Johnson, you jest turn dat hoss around quick,\" and she jerked at the  reins herself. \"You heah, Sam? Quick, I tells you. Get back to dat  house. I'se forgot to bring--to bring my lunch basket!\"    \"Oh, never mind, Dinah,\" Mrs. Bobbsey interrupted. \"We will have lunch  on the train.\"    \"But I couldn't leab dat nice lunch I got ready fo' de chillen in  between, missus,\" the colored woman urged. \"I'll get it quick as a  wink. Now,  Sam, you rush in dar quick, and fetch dat red and white  basket dat smells  like chicken!\"    So the good-natured maid had her way, much to the delight of Bert and  Freddie, who liked nothing so well as one of Dinah's homemade lunches.    The railroad station was reached without mishap, and while Mr. Bobbsey  attended to getting the baskets checked at the little window in the big  round office, the children sat about \"exploring.\" Freddie hung back a  little when a locomotive steamed up. He clung to his mother's skirt,  yet wanted to see how the machine worked.    \"That's the fireman,\" Bert told him, pointing to the man in the cab of  the engine.    \"Fireman!\" Freddie repeated. \"Not like our firemen. I wouldn't be that  kind,\" He had always wanted to be a fireman who helps to put out fires.    \"Oh, this is another kind,\" his father explained, just then coming up  in readiness for the start.    \"I guess Snoop's afraid,\" Freddie whispered to his mother, while he  peeped into the little box where Snoop was peacefully purring. Glad of  the  excuse to get a little further away, Freddie ran back to where  Dinah sat  on a long shiny bench.    \"Say, chile,\" she began, \"you hear dat music ober dar? Well, a big fat  lady jest jumped up and down on dat machine and it starts up and plays  Swanee Ribber.\"    \"That's a weighing machine,\" Nan said with a laugh. \"You just put a  penny in it and it tells you how much you weigh besides playing a tune.\"    \"Lan' o' massy! does it? Wonder has I time to try it?\"    \"Yes, come on,\" called Bert. \"Father said we have plenty of time,\" and  at the word Dinah set out to get weighed. She looked a little scared,  as if  it might \"go off\" first, but when she heard the soft strain of  an old  melody coming out she almost wanted to dance.    \"Now, ain't dat fine!\" she exclaimed. \"Wouldn't dat be splendid in de  kitchen to weigh de flour, Freddie?\"    But even the interesting sights in the railroad station had to be given  up now, for the porter swung open a big gate and called: \"All aboard  for Meadow Brook!\" and the Bobbseys hurried off.        CHAPTER III    SNOOP ON THE TRAIN    \"I'm glad Dinah looks nice,\" Flossie whispered to her mother, when she  saw how beautiful the parlor car was. \"And isn't Freddie good?\" the  little  girl remarked anxiously, as if fearing her brother might forget  his best  manners in such a grand place.    Freddie and Bert sat near their father on the big soft revolving chairs  in the Pullman car, while Nan and Flossie occupied the sofa at the end  near their mother. Dinah sat up straight and dignified, and, as Flossie  said, really looked nice, in her very clean white waist and her soft  black skirt. On her carefully parted hair she wore a neat little black  turban. Bert always laughed at the number of \"parts\" Dinah made in her  kinky hair, and declared that she ought to be a civil engineer, she  could draw such  splendid maps even on the back of her head.    The grandeur of the parlor car almost overcame Freddie, but he clung to  Snoop in the pasteboard box and positively refused to let the kitten go  into the baggage car. Dinah's lunch basket was so neatly done up the  porter carried it very carefully to her seat when she entered the  train, although lunch baskets are not often taken in as \"Pullman car  baggage.\"    \"I'm going to let Snoop out!\" whispered Freddie suddenly, and before  anyone had a chance to stop him, the little black kitten jumped out of  the  box, and perched himself on the window sill to look out at the  fine  scenery.    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, \"the porter will put him off the train!\"  and she tried to catch the now happy little Snoop.    \"No, he won't,\" Mr. Bobbsey assured her. \"I will watch out for that.\"    \"Here, Snoop,\" coaxed Nan, also alarmed. \"Come, Snoop!\"    But the kitten had been captive long enough to appreciate his liberty  now, and so refused to be coaxed. Flossie came down between the velvet  chairs very cautiously, but as soon as Snoop saw her arm stretch out  for him, he just walked over the back of the highest seat and down into  the lap of a sleeping lady!    \"Oh, mercy me!\" screamed the lady, as she awoke with Snoop's tail  whisking over her face. \"Goodness, gracious! what is that?\" and before  she had  fully recovered from the shock she actually jumped up on the  chair, like  the funny pictures of a woman and a mouse.    The people around could not help laughing, but Freddie and the other  Bobbseys were frightened.    \"Oh, will they kill Snoop now?\" Freddie almost cried. \"Dinah, please  help  me get him!\"    By this time the much scared lady had found out it was only a little  kitten, and feeling very foolish she sat down and coaxed Snoop into her  lap again. Mr. Bobbsey hurried to apologize.    \"We'll have to put him back in the box,\" Mr. Bobbsey declared, but that  was easier said than done, for no sooner would one of the Bobbseys  approach the cat than Snoop would walk himself off. And not on the  floor  either, but up and down the velvet chairs, and in and out under  the  passengers' arms. Strange to say, not one of the people minded it,  but all  petted Snoop until, as Bert said, \"He owned the car.\"    \"Dat cat am de worst!\" Dinah exclaimed. \"'Pears like it was so stuck up  an' fine dar ain't no place in dis 'yere Pullin' car good 'nough fer  him.\"    \"Oh, the porter! the porter!\" Bert cried. \"He'll surely throw Snoop out  of the window.\"    \"Snoop! Snoop!\" the whole family called in chorus, but Snoop saw the  porter himself and made up his mind the right thing to do under the  circumstances would be to make friends.    \"Cat?\" exclaimed the good-looking colored man. \"Scat! Well, I declare!  What you think of that?\"    Freddie felt as if he were going to die, he was so scared, and  Flossie's tears ran down her cheeks.    \"Will he eat him?\" Freddie blubbered, thinking of some queer stories he  had heard like that. Mr. Bobbsey, too, was a little alarmed and hurried  to reach Snoop.    The porter stooped to catch the offending kitten, while Snoop walked  right up to him, sniffed his uniform, and stepped upon the outstretched  black hand.    \"Well, you is a nice little kitten,\" the porter admitted, fondling  Snoop in spite of orders.    \"Oh, please, Mr. Porter, give me my cat!\" cried Freddie, breaking away  from all restraint and reaching Snoop.    \"Yours, is it? Well, I don't blame you, boy, for bringing dat cat  along. An' say,\" and the porter leaned down to the frightened Freddie,  \"it's against orders, but I'd jest like to take dis yer kitten back in  de kitchen and treat him, for he's--he's a star!\" and he fondled Snoop  closer.    \"But I didn't know it was wrong, and I'll put him right back in the  box,\" Freddie whimpered, not quite understanding the porter's intention.    \"Well, say, son!\" the porter exclaimed as Mr. Bobbsey came up. \"What do  you say if you papa let you come back in de kitchen wid me? Den you can  jest see how I treat de kitty-cat!\"    So Freddie started off after the porter, who proudly carried Snoop,  while Mr. Bobbsey brought up the rear. Everybody along the aisle wanted  to pet Snoop, who, from being a little stowaway was now the hero of the  occasion. More than once Freddie stumbled against the side of the big  seats as the cars swung along like a reckless automobile, but each time  his father caught him by the blouse and set him on his feet again,  until at last, after passing through the big dining car, the kitchen  was reached.    \"What you got dar? Somethin' fer soup?\" laughed the good-natured cook,  who was really fond of cats and wouldn't harm one for the world.    Soon the situation was explained, and as the porters and others  gathered around in admiration, Snoop drank soup like a gentleman, and  then took two courses, one of fish and one of meat, in splendid  traveler fashion.    \"Dat's de way to drink soup on a fast train,\" laughed the porter. \"You  makes sure of it dat way, and saves your clothes. Ha! ha! ha!\" he  laughed, remembering how many men have to have their good clothes  cleaned of soup after a dinner on a fast train. Reluctantly the men  gave Snoop back to Freddie, who, this time, to make sure of no further  adventures, put the popular black kitten in his box in spite of  protests from the admiring passengers.    \"You have missed so much of the beautiful scenery,\" Nan told Freddie  and her father when they joined the party again. \"Just see"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#2)"],[1,"ER, AT CHICAGO, (JULY 10TH)--THE ADMIXTURE OF RACES--THE  VOTING \"UP OR DOWN\" OF SLAVERY--THE \"ARGUMENTS OF KINGS\"--TRUTHS OF THE  DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE--DOUGLAS'S BLOOMINGTON SPEECH (JULY 16TH),  OF VINDICATION AND ATTACK--HISTORY OF THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE--THE  UNHOLY ALLIANCE--THE TWO POINTS AT ISSUE--THE \"WHITE MAN'S\" COUNTRY  --DOUGLAS'S PLEDGES TO WEBSTER AND CLAY--DOUGLAS'S SPRINGFIELD SPEECH,  JULY 17TH--THE IRRECONCILABLE PRINCIPLES AT ISSUE BETWEEN LINCOLN AND  HIMSELF--LINCOLN'S GREAT SPEECH, AT SPRINGFIELD, THE SAME EVENING  --DOUGLAS'S TRIUMPHANT MARCHES AND ENTRIES--THE \"OFFICES SEEN IN HIS  ROUND, JOLLY, FRUITFUL FACE\"--LINCOLN'S LEAN-FACED FIGHT, FOR PRINCIPLE  ALONE--DOUGLAS'S VARIOUS SPEECHES REVIEWED--THE REAL QUESTION BETWEEN  REPUBLICANS AND DOUGLAS MEN AND THE BUCHANAN MEN--JACKSON'S VETO OF THE  NATIONAL BANK CHARTER--DEMOCRATIC REVOLT AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT  DECISION--VINDICATION OF CLAY--\"NEGRO EQUALITY\"--MR.
