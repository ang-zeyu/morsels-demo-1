I was a desperate man when  I came here, and I'm just as desperate now.  I don't mind what I do if  only I can get out of this without a scandal.\"    Again I see him, leaning back in one of the luxurious chairs with which  his room was furnished. I see his indolent, athletic figure; his pale,  sharp, clean-shaven features; his curly black hair; his strong,  unscrupulous mouth.  And again I feel the clear beam of his wonderful  eye, cold and luminous as a star, shining into my brain--sifting the  very secrets of my heart.    \"I wonder if you mean all that!\" he said at length.  \"You do in your  present mood; but who can back his mood to last?  Still, there's hope  when a chap takes that tone.  Now I think of it, too, you were a plucky  little devil at school; you once did me rather a good turn, I  recollect.  Remember it, Bunny?  Well, wait a bit, and perhaps I'll be  able to do you a better one.  Give me time to think.\"    He got up, lit a fresh cigarette, and fell to pacing the room once  more, but with a slower and more thoughtful step, and for a much longer  period than before.  Twice he stopped at my chair as though on the  point of speaking, but each time he checked himself and resumed his  stride in silence.  Once he threw up the window, which he had shut some  time since, and stood for some moments leaning out into the fog which  filled the Albany courtyard.  Meanwhile a clock on the chimney-piece  struck one, and one again for the half-hour, without a word between us.    Yet I not only kept my chair with patience, but I acquired an  incongruous equanimity in that half-hour.  Insensibly I had shifted my  burden to the broad shoulders of this splendid friend, and my thoughts  wandered with my eyes as the minutes passed.  The room was the  good-sized, square one, with the folding doors, the marble  mantel-piece, and the gloomy, old-fashioned distinction peculiar to the  Albany.  It was charmingly furnished and arranged, with the right  amount of negligence and the right amount of taste.  What struck me  most, however, was the absence of the usual insignia of a cricketer's  den.  Instead of the conventional rack of war-worn bats, a carved oak  bookcase, with every shelf in a litter, filled the better part of one  wall; and where I looked for cricketing groups, I found reproductions  of such works as \"Love and Death\" and \"The Blessed Damozel,\" in dusty  frames and different parallels.  The man might have been a minor poet  instead of an athlete of the first water.  But there had always been a  fine streak of Ã¦stheticism in his complex composition; some of these  very pictures I had myself dusted in his study at school; and they set  me thinking of yet another of his many sides--and of the little  incident to which he had just referred.    Everybody knows how largely the tone of a public school depends on that  of the eleven, and on the character of the captain of cricket in  particular; and I have never heard it denied that in A. J. Raffles's  time our tone was good, or that such influence as he troubled to exert  was on the side of the angels.  Yet it was whispered in the school that  he was in the habit of parading the town at night in loud checks and a  false beard.  It was whispered, and disbelieved.  I alone knew it for a  fact; for night after night had I pulled the rope up after him when the  rest of the dormitory were asleep, and kept awake by the hour to let it  down again on a given signal.  Well, one night he was over-bold, and  within an ace of ignominious expulsion in the hey-day of his fame.  Consummate daring and extraordinary nerve on his part, aided,  doubtless, by some little presence of mind on mine, averted the  untoward result; and no more need be said of a discreditable incident.  But I cannot pretend to have forgotten it in throwing myself on this  man's mercy in my desperation.  And I was wondering how much of his  leniency was owing to the fact that Raffles had not forgotten it  either, when he stopped and stood over my chair once more.    \"I've been thinking of that night we had the narrow squeak,\" he began.  \"Why do you start?\"    \"I was thinking of it too.\"    He smiled, as though he had read my thoughts.    \"Well, you were the right sort of little beggar then, Bunny; you didn't  talk and you didn't flinch. You asked no questions and you told no  tales.  I wonder if you're like that now?\"    \"I don't know,\" said I, slightly puzzled by his tone.  \"I've made such  a mess of my own affairs that I trust myself about as little as I'm  likely to be trusted by anybody else.  Yet I never in my life went back  on a friend.  I will say that, otherwise perhaps I mightn't be in such  a hole to-night.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Raffles, nodding to himself, as though in assent to  some hidden train of thought; \"exactly what I remember of you, and I'll  bet it's as true now as it was ten years ago.  We don't alter, Bunny.  We only develop.  I suppose neither you nor I are really altered since  you used to let down that rope and I used to come up it hand over hand.  You would stick at nothing for a pal--what?\"    \"At nothing in this world,\" I was pleased to cry.    \"Not even at a crime?\" said Raffles, smiling.    I stopped to think, for his tone had changed, and I felt sure he was  chaffing me.  Yet his eye seemed as much in earnest as ever, and for my  part I was in no mood for reservations.    \"No, not even at that,\" I declared; \"name your crime, and I'm your man.\"    He looked at me one moment in wonder, and another moment in doubt; then  turned the matter off with a shake of his head, and the little cynical  laugh that was all his own.    \"You're a nice chap, Bunny!  A real desperate character--what?  Suicide  one moment, and any crime I like the next!  What you want is a drag, my  boy, and you did well to come to a decent law-abiding citizen with a  reputation to lose.  None the less we must have that money to-night--by  hook or crook.\"    \"To-night, Raffles?\"    \"The sooner the better.  Every hour after ten o'clock to-morrow morning  is an hour of risk.  Let one of those checks get round to your own  bank, and you and it are dishonored together.  No, we must raise the  wind to-night and re-open your account first thing to-morrow.  And I  rather think I know where the wind can be raised.\"    \"At two o'clock in the morning?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But how--but where--at such an hour?\"    \"From a friend of mine here in Bond Street.\"    \"He must be a very intimate friend!\"    \"Intimate's not the word.  I have the run of his place and a latch-key  all to myself.\"    \"You would knock him up at this hour of the night?\"    \"If he's in bed.\"    \"And it's essential that I should go in with you?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    \"Then I must; but I'm bound to say I don't like the idea, Raffles.\"    \"Do you prefer the alternative?\" asked my companion, with a sneer.  \"No, hang it, that's unfair!\" he cried apologetically in the same  breath.  \"I quite understand.  It's a beastly ordeal.  But it would  never do for you to stay outside.  I tell you what, you shall have a  peg before we start--just one.  There's the whiskey, here's a syphon,  and I'll be putting on an overcoat while you help yourself.\"    Well, I daresay I did so with some freedom, for this plan of his was  not the less distasteful to me from its apparent inevitability.  I must  own, however, that it possessed fewer terrors before my glass was  empty.  Meanwhile Raffles rejoined me, with a covert coat over his  blazer, and a soft felt hat set carelessly on the curly head he shook  with a smile as I passed him the decanter.    \"When we come back,\" said he.  \"Work first, play afterward.  Do you see  what day it is?\" he added, tearing a leaflet from a Shakespearian  calendar, as I drained my glass.  \"March 15th.  'The Ides of March, the  Ides of March, remember.' Eh, Bunny, my boy?  You won't forget them,  will you?\"    And, with a laugh, he threw some coals on the fire before turning down  the gas like a careful householder.  So we went out together as the  clock on the chimney-piece was striking two.      II    Piccadilly was a trench of raw white fog, rimmed with blurred  street-lamps, and lined with a thin coating of adhesive mud.  We met no  other wayfarers on the deserted flagstones, and were ourselves favored  with a very hard stare from the constable of the beat, who, however,  touched his helmet on recognizing my companion.    \"You see, I'm known to the police,\" laughed Raffles as we passed on.  \"Poor devils, they've got to keep their weather eye open on a night  like this!  A fog may be a bore to you and me, Bunny, but it's a  perfect godsend to the criminal classes, especially so late in their  season.  Here we are, though--and I'm hanged if the beggar isn't in bed  and asleep after all!\"    We had turned into Bond Street, and had halted on the curb a few yards  down on the right.  Raffles was gazing up at some windows across the  road, windows barely discernible through the mist, and without the  glimmer of a light to throw them out. They were over a jeweller's shop,  as I could see by the peep-hole in the shop door, and the bright light  burning within.  But the entire \"upper part,\" with the private  street-door next the shop, was black and blank as the sky itself.    \"Better give it up for to-night,\" I urged. \"Surely the morning will be  time enough!\"    \"Not a bit of it,\" said Raffles.  \"I have his key. We'll surprise him.  Come along.\"    And seizing my right arm, he hurried me across the road, opened the  door with his latch-key, and in another moment had shut it swiftly but  softly behind us.  We stood together in the dark.  Outside, a measured  step was approaching; we had heard it through the fog as we crossed the  street; now, as it drew nearer, my companion's fingers tightened on my  arm.    \"It may be the chap himself,\" he whispered. \"He's the devil of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#2)"],[1,"content to live quietly among their people.  We have spent more money than ever we made in these wars, and even were  our kings to become indeed, as they claim, kings of France as well as  England, the ill would be much greater, as far as I can see, for us all.  Still there may be things, dame, that we country folks don't understand,  and I suppose that it must be so, else Parliament would not be so willing  to vote money always when the kings want it for wars with France. The wars  in France don't affect us as much as those with Scotland and Wales. When  our kings go to France to fight they take with them only such as are  willing to go, men-at-arms and archers; but when we have troubles such as  took place but five or six years ago, when Douglas and Percy and the Welsh  all joined against us, then the lords call out their vassals and the  sheriffs the militia of the county, and we have to go to fight willy-nilly. Our lord had a hundred of us with him to fight for the king at  Shrewsbury. Nigh thirty never came back again. That is worse than the  French wars, dame.\"    \"Don't I know it, for wasn't my second boy one of those who never came  back. Ay, ay, they had better be fighting in France, perhaps, for that  lets out the hot blood that might otherwise bring on fighting at home.\"    \"That is so, dame, things are all for the best, though one does not always  see it.\"    A week later all the tenantry gathered in front of the castle to wish God-speed to their lord and lady, and to watch the following by which they  were accompanied. First there passed half a dozen mounted men-at-arms, who  were to accompany the party but half a day's march and then to return with  Sir Aylmer. Next to these rode Sir Eustace and Lady Margaret, still a  beautiful woman, a worthy mate of her noble-looking husband. On her other  side rode Sir Aylmer; then came John Harpen, Sir Eustace's esquire; beside  whom trotted Agnes, a bright, merry-faced girl of twelve. Guy rode with  the two boys; then came twenty-four men-at-arms, many of whom had fought  well and stoutly at Shrewsbury; while Tom, the miller's son, or, as he was  generally called, Long Tom, strode along at the head of twenty-four  bowmen, each of whom carried the long English bow and quiver full of  cloth-yard arrows, and, in addition, a heavy axe at his leathern girdle.    Behind these were some servitors leading horses carrying provisions for  the journey, and valises with the clothes of Sir Eustace, his wife, and  children, and a heavy cart drawn by four strong horses with the bundles of  extra garments for the men-at-arms and archers, and several large sheaves  of spare arrows. The men-at-arms wore iron caps, as also breast and back  pieces. On the shoulders and arms of their leathern jerkins iron rings  were sewn thickly, forming a sort of chain armour, while permitting  perfect freedom of the limbs. The archers also wore steel caps, which,  like those of the men-at-arms, came low down on the neck and temples. They  had on tough leathern frocks, girded in at the waist, and falling to the  knee; some of them had also iron rings sewn on the shoulders. English  archers were often clad in green cloth, but Sir Eustace had furnished the  garments, and had chosen leather, both as being far more durable, and as  offering a certain amount of defence.    The frocks were sleeveless, and each man wore cloth sleeves of a colour  according to his fancy. The band was in all respects a well-appointed one.  As Sir Eustace wished to avoid exciting comment among his neighbours, he  had abstained from taking a larger body of men; and it was partly for this  reason that he had decided not to dress the archers in green. But every  man had been carefully picked; the men-at-arms were all powerful fellows  who had seen service; the archers were little inferior in physique, for  strength as well as skill was required in archery, and in choosing the men  Sir Eustace had, when there was no great difference in point of skill,  selected the most powerful among those who were willing to take service  with him.    Guy enjoyed the two days' ride to Southampton greatly. It was the first  time that he had been away from home, and his spirits were high at thus  starting on a career that would, he hoped, bring him fame and honour.  Henry and his brother and sister were also in good glee, although the  journey was no novelty to them, for they had made it twice previously.  Beyond liking change, as was natural at their age, they cared not whether  they were at their English or at their French home, as they spoke both  languages with equal fluency, and their life at one castle differed but  little from that at the other.    Embarking at Portsmouth in a ship that was carrying military stores to  Calais, they coasted along the shores of Sussex and of Kent as far as  Dungeness, and then made across to Calais. It was early in April, the  weather was exceptionally favourable, and they encountered no rough seas  whatever. On the way Sir Eustace related to Guy and his sons the events  that had taken place in France, and had led up to the civil war that was  raging so furiously there.    \"In 1392, the King of France being seized with madness, the Dukes of  Burgundy and Orleans in a very short time wrested the power of the state  from the hands of his faithful councillors, the Constable de Clisson, La  Riviere, and others. De Clisson retired to his estate and castle at  Montelhery, the two others were seized and thrown into prison. De Clisson  was prosecuted before Parliament as a false and wicked traitor; but the  king, acting on the advice of Orleans, who had not then broken with the  Dukes of Burgundy and Berri, had, after La Riviere and another had been in  prison for a year, stopped the prosecution, and restored their estates to  them. Until 1402 the Dukes of Burgundy and Berri were all-powerful, and in  1396 a great number of knights and nobles, led by John, Count of Nevers,  the eldest son of the Duke of Burgundy, went to the assistance of the King  of Hungary, which country was being invaded by the Turks. They were,  however, on the 28th of September, utterly defeated. The greater portion  of them were killed; Nevers and the rest were ransomed and brought home.    \"In 1402 the king, influenced by his wife, Isobel, and his brother, the  Duke of Orleans, who were on terms of the closest alliance, placed the  entire government in the hands of the latter, who at once began to abuse  it to such an extent, by imposing enormous taxes upon the clergy and the  people, that he paved the way for the return of his uncle of Burgundy to  power. On the 27th of April, 1404, Philip the Bold of Burgundy died. He  was undoubtedly ambitious, but he was also valiant and able, and he had  the good of France at heart. He was succeeded by his son John, called the  Fearless, from the bravery that he had displayed in the unfortunate  Hungarian campaign. The change was disastrous for France. John was violent  and utterly unscrupulous, and capable of any deed to gratify either his  passions, jealousies, or hatreds. At first he cloaked his designs against  Orleans by an appearance of friendship, paid him a visit at his castle  near Vincennes, where he was at the time lying ill. When he recovered, the  two princes went to mass together, dined at their uncle's, the Duke of  Berri, and together entered Paris; and the Parisians fondly hoped that  there was an end of the rivalry that had done so much harm. It was,  however, but a very short time afterwards that, on the 23d of November,  1407, as the Duke of Orleans was returning from having dined with the  queen, and was riding with only two esquires and four or five men on foot  carrying torches, twenty armed men sprang out from behind a house and  rushed upon him.    \"'I am the Duke of Orleans,' the prince cried; but they hurled him from  his mule, and as he tried to rise to his feet one blow struck off the hand  he raised to protect his head, other blows rained down upon him from axe  and sword, and in less than a minute the duke lay dead. The Duke of  Burgundy at first affected grief and indignation, but at the council the  next day he boldly avowed that Orleans had been killed by his orders. He  at once took horse and rode to the frontier of Flanders, which he reached  safely, though hotly chased by a party of the Duke of Orleans' knights.  The duke's widow, who was in the country at the time, hastened up to Paris  with her children, and appealed for justice to the king, who declared that  he regarded the deed done to his brother as done to himself. The Dukes of  Berri and Bourbon, the Constable and Chancellor, all assured her that she  should have justice; but there was no force that could hope to cope with  that which Burgundy could bring into the field, and when, two months  later, Burgundy entered Paris at the head of a thousand men-at-arms, no  attempt was made at resistance, and the murderer was received with  acclamations by the fickle populace.    \"The king at the time was suffering from one of his terrible fits of  insanity, but a great assembly was held, at which princes, councillors,  lords, doctors of law, and prominent citizens were present. A monk of the  Cordeliers, named John Petit, then spoke for five hours in justification  of the duke, and the result was that the poor insane king was induced to  sign letters cancelling the penalty of the crime. For four months the duke  remained absolute master of Paris, disposing of all posts and honours, and  sparing no efforts to render himself popular with the burghers. A serious  rebellion breaking out at Liege, and the troops sent against the town  being repulsed, he was obliged to leave Paris to put down the revolt. As  soon as he had left, the queen and the partisans of Orleans prepared to  take advantage of his absence, and two months later Queen Isobel marched  with the dauphin, now some thirteen years old, from Melun"]]]
