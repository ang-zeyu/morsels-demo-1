Tannis of the Flats        FURTHER CHRONICLES OF AVONLEA        I. AUNT CYNTHIA'S PERSIAN CAT    Max always blesses the animal when it is referred to; and I don't  deny that things have worked together for good after all.  But  when I think of the anguish of mind which Ismay and I underwent  on account of that abominable cat, it is not a blessing that  arises uppermost in my thoughts.    I never was fond of cats, although I admit they are well enough  in their place, and I can worry along comfortably with a nice,  matronly old tabby who can take care of herself and be of some  use in the world.  As for Ismay, she hates cats and always did.    But Aunt Cynthia, who adored them, never could bring herself to  understand that any one could possibly dislike them.  She firmly  believed that Ismay and I really liked cats deep down in our  hearts, but that, owing to some perverse twist in our moral  natures, we would not own up to it, but willfully persisted in  declaring we didn't.    Of all cats I loathed that white Persian cat of Aunt Cynthia's.  And, indeed, as we always suspected and finally proved, Aunt  herself looked upon the creature with more pride than affection.  She would have taken ten times the comfort in a good, common puss  that she did in that spoiled beauty.  But a Persian cat with a  recorded pedigree and a market value of one hundred dollars  tickled Aunt Cynthia's pride of possession to such an extent that  she deluded herself into believing that the animal was really the  apple of her eye.    It had been presented to her when a kitten by a missionary nephew  who had brought it all the way home from Persia; and for the next  three years Aunt Cynthia's household existed to wait on that cat,  hand and foot.  It was snow-white, with a bluish-gray spot on the  tip of its tail; and it was blue-eyed and deaf and delicate.  Aunt Cynthia was always worrying lest it should take cold and  die.  Ismay and I used to wish that it would--we were so tired of  hearing about it and its whims.  But we did not say so to Aunt  Cynthia.  She would probably never have spoken to us again and  there was no wisdom in offending Aunt Cynthia.  When you have an  unencumbered aunt, with a fat bank account, it is just as well to  keep on good terms with her, if you can.  Besides, we really  liked Aunt Cynthia very much--at times.  Aunt Cynthia was one of  those rather exasperating people who nag at and find fault with  you until you think you are justified in hating them, and who  then turn round and do something so really nice and kind for you  that you feel as if you were compelled to love them dutifully  instead.    So we listened meekly when she discoursed on Fatima--the cat's  name was Fatima--and, if it was wicked of us to wish for the  latter's decease, we were well punished for it later on.    One day, in November, Aunt Cynthia came sailing out to  Spencervale.  She really came in a phaeton, drawn by a fat gray  pony, but somehow Aunt Cynthia always gave you the impression of  a full rigged ship coming gallantly on before a favorable wind.    That was a Jonah day for us all through.  Everything had gone  wrong.  Ismay had spilled grease on her velvet coat, and the fit  of the new blouse I was making was hopelessly askew, and the  kitchen stove smoked and the bread was sour.  Moreover, Huldah  Jane Keyson, our tried and trusty old family nurse and cook and  general \"boss,\" had what she called the \"realagy\" in her  shoulder; and, though Huldah Jane is as good an old creature as  ever lived, when she has the \"realagy\" other people who are in  the house want to get out of it and, if they can't, feel about as  comfortable as St. Lawrence on his gridiron.    And on top of this came Aunt Cynthia's call and request.    \"Dear me,\" said Aunt Cynthia, sniffing, \"don't I smell smoke?  You girls must manage your range very badly.  Mine never smokes.  But it is no more than one might expect when two girls try to  keep house without a man about the place.\"    \"We get along very well without a man about the place,\" I said  loftily.  Max hadn't been in for four whole days and, though  nobody wanted to see him particularly, I couldn't help wondering  why.  \"Men are nuisances.\"    \"I dare say you would like to pretend you think so,\" said Aunt  Cynthia, aggravatingly.  \"But no woman ever does really think so,  you know.  I imagine that pretty Anne Shirley, who is visiting  Ella Kimball, doesn't.  I saw her and Dr. Irving out walking this  afternoon, looking very well satisfied with themselves.  If you  dilly-dally much longer, Sue, you will let Max slip through your  fingers yet.\"    That was a tactful thing to say to ME, who had refused Max Irving  so often that I had lost count.  I was furious, and so I smiled  most sweetly on my maddening aunt.    \"Dear Aunt, how amusing of you,\" I said, smoothly.  \"You talk as  if I wanted Max.\"    \"So you do,\" said Aunt Cynthia.    \"If so, why should I have refused him time and again?\" I asked,  smilingly. Right well Aunt Cynthia knew I had.  Max always told  her.    \"Goodness alone knows why,\" said Aunt Cynthia, \"but you may do it  once too often and find yourself taken at your word.  There is  something very fascinating about this Anne Shirley.\"    \"Indeed there is,\" I assented.  \"She has the loveliest eyes I  ever saw.  She would be just the wife for Max, and I hope he will  marry her.\"    \"Humph,\" said Aunt Cynthia.  \"Well, I won't entice you into  telling any more fibs.  And I didn't drive out here to-day in all  this wind to talk sense into you concerning Max.  I'm going to  Halifax for two months and I want you to take charge of Fatima  for me, while I am away.\"    \"Fatima!\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes.  I don't dare to trust her with the servants.  Mind you  always warm her milk before you give it to her, and don't on any  account let her run out of doors.\"    I looked at Ismay and Ismay looked at me.  We knew we were in for  it.  To refuse would mortally offend Aunt Cynthia.  Besides, if I  betrayed any unwillingness, Aunt Cynthia would be sure to put it  down to grumpiness over what she had said about Max, and rub it  in for years.  But I ventured to ask, \"What if anything happens  to her while you are away?\"    \"It is to prevent that, I'm leaving her with you,\" said Aunt  Cynthia.  \"You simply must not let anything happen to her.  It  will do you good to have a little responsibility.  And you will  have a chance to find out what an adorable creature Fatima really  is.  Well, that is all settled.  I'll send Fatima out to-morrow.\"    \"You can take care of that horrid Fatima beast yourself,\" said  Ismay, when the door closed behind Aunt Cynthia.  \"I won't touch  her with a yard-stick.  You had no business to say we'd take  her.\"    \"Did I say we would take her?\" I demanded, crossly.  \"Aunt  Cynthia took our consent for granted.  And you know, as well as I  do, we couldn't have refused.  So what is the use of being  grouchy?\"    \"If anything happens to her Aunt Cynthia will hold us  responsible,\" said Ismay darkly.    \"Do you think Anne Shirley is really engaged to Gilbert Blythe?\"  I asked curiously.    \"I've heard that she was,\" said Ismay, absently.  \"Does she eat  anything but milk?  Will it do to give her mice?\"    \"Oh, I guess so.  But do you think Max has really fallen in love  with her?\"    \"I dare say.  What a relief it will be for you if he has.\"    \"Oh, of course,\" I said, frostily.  \"Anne Shirley or Anne Anybody  Else, is perfectly welcome to Max if she wants him.  _I_  certainly do not.  Ismay Meade, if that stove doesn't stop  smoking I shall fly into bits.  This is a detestable day.  I hate  that creature!\"    \"Oh, you shouldn't talk like that, when you don't even know her,\"  protested Ismay.  \"Every one says Anne Shirley is lovely--\"    \"I was talking about Fatima,\" I cried in a rage.    \"Oh!\" said Ismay.    Ismay is stupid at times.  I thought the way she said \"Oh\" was  inexcusably stupid.    Fatima arrived the next day.  Max brought her out in a covered  basket, lined with padded crimson satin.  Max likes cats and Aunt  Cynthia.  He explained how we were to treat Fatima and when Ismay  had gone out of the room--Ismay always went out of the room when  she knew I particularly wanted her to remain--he proposed to me  again.  Of course I said no, as usual, but I was rather pleased.  Max had been proposing to me about every two months for two  years.  Sometimes, as in this case, he went three months, and  then I always wondered why.  I concluded that he could not be  really interested in Anne Shirley, and I was relieved.  I didn't  want to marry Max but it was pleasant and convenient to have him  around, and we would miss him dreadfully if any other girl  snapped him up.  He was so useful and always willing to do  anything for us--nail a shingle on the roof, drive us to town,  put down carpets--in short, a very present help in all our  troubles.    So I just beamed on him when I said no.  Max began counting on  his fingers.  When he got as far as eight he shook his head and  began over again.    \"What is it?\" I asked.    \"I'm trying to count up how many times I have proposed to you,\"  he said.  \"But I can't remember whether I asked you to marry me  that day we dug up the garden or not.  If I did it makes--\"    \"No, you didn't,\" I interrupted.    \"Well, that makes it eleven,\" said Max reflectively.  \"Pretty  near the limit, isn't it?  My manly pride will not allow me to  propose to the same girl more than twelve times.  So the next  time will be the last, Sue darling.\"    \"Oh,\" I said, a trifle flatly.  I forgot to resent his calling me  darling.  I wondered if things wouldn't be rather dull when Max  gave up proposing to me.  It was the only excitement I had.  But  of course it would be best--and he couldn't go on at it forever,  so, by the way of gracefully dismissing the subject, I asked him  what Miss Shirley was like.    \"Very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#2)"],[1,"there were only  two ladies in our class and they were the pioneers of their sex at  Queenslea. They were well past their first youth, very grim and angular  and serious; and they could never have been on speaking terms with  a mirror in their best days. But mark you, they were excellent  females--oh, very excellent. Times have changed with a vengeance,  judging from the line-up of co-eds to-day. There was one girl there who  can't be a day over eighteen--and she looked as if she were made out of  gold and roseleaves and dewdrops.\"    \"The oracle speaks in poetry,\" laughed Eric. \"That was Florence  Percival, who led the class in mathematics, as I'm a living man. By many  she is considered the beauty of her class. I can't say that such is  my opinion. I don't greatly care for that blonde, babyish style of  loveliness--I prefer Agnes Campion. Did you notice her--the tall, dark  girl with the ropes of hair and a sort of crimson, velvety bloom on her  face, who took honours in philosophy?\"    \"I DID notice her,\" said David emphatically, darting a keen side glance  at his friend. \"I noticed her most particularly and critically--for  someone whispered her name behind me and coupled it with the exceedingly  interesting information that Miss Campion was supposed to be the future  Mrs. Eric Marshall. Whereupon I stared at her with all my eyes.\"    \"There is no truth in that report,\" said Eric in a tone of annoyance.  \"Agnes and I are the best of friends and nothing more. I like and admire  her more than any woman I know; but if the future Mrs. Eric Marshall  exists in the flesh I haven't met her yet. I haven't even started out  to look for her--and don't intend to for some years to come. I have  something else to think of,\" he concluded, in a tone of contempt, for  which anyone might have known he would be punished sometime if Cupid  were not deaf as well as blind.    \"You'll meet the lady of the future some day,\" said David dryly. \"And in  spite of your scorn I venture to predict that if fate doesn't bring  her before long you'll very soon start out to look for her. A word of  advice, oh, son of your mother. When you go courting take your common  sense with you.\"    \"Do you think I shall be likely to leave it behind?\" asked Eric  amusedly.    \"Well, I mistrust you,\" said David, sagely wagging his head. \"The  Lowland Scotch part of you is all right, but there's a Celtic streak in  you, from that little Highland grandmother of yours, and when a man has  that there's never any knowing where it will break out, or what dance  it will lead him, especially when it comes to this love-making business.  You are just as likely as not to lose your head over some little fool or  shrew for the sake of her outward favour and make yourself miserable for  life. When you pick you a wife please remember that I shall reserve the  right to pass a candid opinion on her.\"    \"Pass all the opinions you like, but it is MY opinion, and mine only,  which will matter in the long run,\" retorted Eric.    \"Confound you, yes, you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed,\" growled  David, looking at him affectionately. \"I know that, and that is why I'll  never feel at ease about you until I see you married to the right sort  of a girl. She's not hard to find. Nine out of ten girls in this country  of ours are fit for kings' palaces. But the tenth always has to be  reckoned with.\"    \"You are as bad as _Clever Alice_ in the fairy tale who worried over the  future of her unborn children,\" protested Eric.    \"_Clever Alice_ has been very unjustly laughed at,\" said David gravely.  \"We doctors know that. Perhaps she overdid the worrying business a  little, but she was perfectly right in principle. If people worried  a little more about their unborn children--at least, to the extent of  providing a proper heritage, physically, mentally, and morally, for  them--and then stopped worrying about them after they ARE born, this  world would be a very much pleasanter place to live in, and the human  race would make more progress in a generation than it has done in  recorded history.\"    \"Oh, if you are going to mount your dearly beloved hobby of heredity  I am not going to argue with you, David, man. But as for the matter  of urging me to hasten and marry me a wife, why don't you\"--It was on  Eric's lips to say, \"Why don't you get married to a girl of the right  sort yourself and set me a good example?\" But he checked himself. He  knew that there was an old sorrow in David Baker's life which was not to  be unduly jarred by the jests even of privileged friendship. He changed  his question to, \"Why don't you leave this on the knees of the gods  where it properly belongs? I thought you were a firm believer in  predestination, David.\"    \"Well, so I am, to a certain extent,\" said David cautiously. \"I believe,  as an excellent old aunt of mine used to say, that what is to be will  be and what isn't to be happens sometimes. And it is precisely such  unchancy happenings that make the scheme of things go wrong. I dare say  you think me an old fogy, Eric; but I know something more of the world  than you do, and I believe, with Tennyson's _Arthur_, that 'there's no  more subtle master under heaven than is the maiden passion for a maid.'  I want to see you safely anchored to the love of some good woman as soon  as may be, that's all. I'm rather sorry Miss Campion isn't your lady of  the future. I liked her looks, that I did. She is good and strong and  true--and has the eyes of a woman who could love in a way that would  be worth while. Moreover, she's well-born, well-bred, and  well-educated--three very indispensable things when it comes to choosing  a woman to fill your mother's place, friend of mine!\"    \"I agree with you,\" said Eric carelessly. \"I could not marry any woman  who did not fulfill those conditions. But, as I have said, I am not in  love with Agnes Campion--and it wouldn't be of any use if I were. She is  as good as engaged to Larry West. You remember West?\"    \"That thin, leggy fellow you chummed with so much your first two years  in Queenslea? Yes, what has become of him?\"    \"He had to drop out after his second year for financial reasons. He is  working his own way through college, you know. For the past two years  he has been teaching school in some out-of-the-way place over in Prince  Edward Island. He isn't any too well, poor fellow--never was very strong  and has studied remorselessly. I haven't heard from him since February.  He said then that he was afraid he wasn't going to be able to stick it  out till the end of the school year. I hope Larry won't break down. He  is a fine fellow and worthy even of Agnes Campion. Well, here we are.  Coming in, David?\"    \"Not this afternoon--haven't got time. I must mosey up to the North End  to see a man who has got a lovely throat. Nobody can find out what is  the matter. He has puzzled all the doctors. He has puzzled me, but I'll  find out what is wrong with him if he'll only live long enough.\"        CHAPTER II. A LETTER OF DESTINY    Eric, finding that his father had not yet returned from the college,  went into the library and sat down to read a letter he had picked up  from the hall table. It was from Larry West, and after the first few  lines Eric's face lost the absent look it had worn and assumed an  expression of interest.    \"I am writing to ask a favour of you, Marshall,\" wrote West. \"The fact  is, I've fallen into the hands of the Philistines--that is to say, the  doctors. I've not been feeling very fit all winter but I've held on,  hoping to finish out the year.    \"Last week my landlady--who is a saint in spectacles and calico--looked  at me one morning at the breakfast table and said, VERY gently, 'You  must go to town to-morrow, Master, and see a doctor about yourself.'    \"I went and did not stand upon the order of my going. Mrs. Williamson  is She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed. She has an inconvenient habit of making you  realize that she is exactly right, and that you would be all kinds of a  fool if you didn't take her advice. You feel that what she thinks to-day  you will think to-morrow.    \"In Charlottetown I consulted a doctor. He punched and pounded me, and  poked things at me and listened at the other end of them; and finally he  said I must stop work 'immejutly and to onct' and hie me straightway  to a climate not afflicted with the north-east winds of Prince Edward  Island in the spring. I am not to be allowed to do any work until the  fall. Such was his dictum and Mrs. Williamson enforces it.    \"I shall teach this week out and then the spring vacation of three weeks  begins. I want you to come over and take my place as pedagogue in the  Lindsay school for the last week in May and the month of June. The  school year ends then and there will be plenty of teachers looking for  the place, but just now I cannot get a suitable substitute. I have a  couple of pupils who are preparing to try the Queen's Academy entrance  examinations, and I don't like to leave them in the lurch or hand them  over to the tender mercies of some third-class teacher who knows little  Latin and less Greek. Come over and take the school till the end of the  term, you petted son of luxury. It will do you a world of good to learn  how rich a man feels when he is earning twenty-five dollars a month by  his own unaided efforts!    \"Seriously, Marshall, I hope you can come, for I don't know any other  fellow I can ask. The work isn't hard, though you'll likely find it  monotonous. Of course, this little north-shore farming settlement isn't  a very lively place. The rising and setting of the sun are the most  exciting events of the average day. But the people are very kind and  hospitable; and Prince Edward Island in the month of June is such a  thing as you don't often see except in happy dreams. There are some  trout in the pond and you'll always find an old salt at the harbour  ready and willing to take you out cod-fishing "]]]
