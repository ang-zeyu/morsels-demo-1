[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#2)"],[1," to the student. Unfortunately, he has left us in doubt. He  speaks in the vaguest way of the materials he used. There is no evidence  that he had any Celtic written source. We are thus thrown back upon  Latin or French literary originals which are lost, or upon current  continental lore going back to a Celtic source. This very difficult  problem is as yet unsolved in the case of Chretien, as it is in the  case of the Anglo-Norman Beroul, who wrote of Tristan about 1150. The  material evidently was at hand and Chretien appropriated it, without  much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a  setting for the ideal society dreamed of but not realised in his own  day. Add to this literary perspicacity, a good foundation in classic  fable, a modicum of ecclesiastical doctrine, a remarkable facility in  phrase, figure, and rhyme and we have the foundations for Chretien's art  as we shall find it upon closer examination.    A French narrative poet of the twelfth century had three categories of  subject-matter from which to choose: legends connected with the history  of France (\"matiere de France\"), legends connected with Arthur and  other Celtic heroes (\"matiere de Bretagne\"), and stories culled from  the history or mythology of Greece and Rome, current in Latin and French  translations (\"matiere de Rome la grant\"). Chretien tells us in \"Cliges\"  that his first essays as a poet were the translations into French of  certain parts of Ovid's most popular works: the \"Metamorphoses\", the  \"Ars Amatoria\", and perhaps the \"Remedia Amoris\". But he appears early  to have chosen as his special field the stories of Celtic origin dealing  with Arthur, the Round Table, and other features of Celtic folk-lore.  Not only was he alive to the literary interest of this material when  rationalised to suit the taste of French readers; his is further the  credit of having given to somewhat crude folk-lore that polish and  elegance which is peculiarly French, and which is inseparably associated  with the Arthurian legends in all modern literature. Though Beroul, and  perhaps other poets, had previously based romantic poems upon individual  Celtic heroes like Tristan, nevertheless to Chretien, so far as we can  see, is due the considerable honour of having constituted Arthur's court  as a literary centre and rallying-point for an innumerable company  of knights and ladies engaged in a never-ending series of amorous  adventures and dangerous quests. Rather than unqualifiedly attribute  to Chretien this important literary convention, one should bear in mind  that all his poems imply familiarity on the part of his readers with  the heroes of the court of which he speaks. One would suppose that other  stories, told before his versions, were current. Some critics would go  so far as to maintain that Chretien came toward the close, rather than  at the beginning, of a school of French writers of Arthurian romances.  But, if so, we do not possess these earlier versions, and for lack of  rivals Chretien may be hailed as an innovator in the current schools of  poetry.    And now let us consider the faults which a modern reader will not be  slow to detect in Chretien's style. Most of his salient faults are  common to all mediaeval narrative literature. They may be ascribed to  the extraordinary leisure of the class for whom it was composed--a class  which was always ready to read an old story told again, and which would  tolerate any description, however detailed. The pastimes of this  class of readers were jousting, hunting, and making love. Hence the  preponderance of these matters in the literature of its leisure hours.  No detail of the joust or hunt was unfamiliar or unwelcome to these  readers; no subtle arguments concerning the art of love were too  abstruse to delight a generation steeped in amorous casuistry and  allegories. And if some scenes seem to us indelicate, yet after  comparison with other authors of his times, Chretien must be let off  with a light sentence. It is certain he intended to avoid what was  indecent, as did the writers of narrative poetry in general. To  appreciate fully the chaste treatment of Chretien one must know some  other forms of mediaeval literature, such as the fabliaux, farces, and  morality plays, in which courtesy imposed no restraint. For our poet's  lack of sense of proportion, and for his carelessness in the proper  motivation of many episodes, no apology can be made. He is not always  guilty; some episodes betoken poetic mastery. But a poet acquainted, as  he was, with some first-class Latin poetry, and who had made a business  of his art, ought to have handled his material more intelligently,  even in the twelfth century. The emphasis is not always laid with  discrimination, nor is his yarn always kept free of tangles in the  spinning.    Reference has been made to Chretien's use of his sources. The tendency  of some critics has been to minimise the French poet's originality by  pointing out striking analogies in classic and Celtic fable. Attention  has been especially directed to the defence of the fountain and the  service of a fairy mistress in \"Yvain\", to the captivity of Arthur's  subjects in the kingdom of Gorre, as narrated in \"Lancelot\", reminding  one so insistently of the treatment of the kingdom of Death from which  some god or hero finally delivers those in durance, and to the reigned  death of Fenice in \"Cliges\", with its many variants. These episodes are  but examples of parallels which will occur to the observant reader. The  difficult point to determine, in speaking of conceptions so widespread  in classic and mediaeval literature, is the immediate source whence  these conceptions reached Chretien. The list of works of reference  appended to this volume will enable the student to go deeper into  this much debated question, and will permit us to dispense with an  examination of the arguments in this place. However, such convincing  parallels for many of Chretien's fairy and romantic episodes have been  adduced by students of Irish and Welsh legend that one cannot fail to  be impressed by the fact that Chretien was in touch, either by oral or  literary tradition, with the populations of Britain and of Brittany, and  that we have here his most immediate inspiration. Professor Foerster,  stoutly opposing the so-called Anglo-Norman theory which supposes the  existence of lost Anglo-Norman romances in French as the sources of  Chretien de Troyes, is, nevertheless, well within the truth when  he insists upon what is, so far as we are concerned, the essential  originality of the French poet. The general reader will to-day care as  little as did the reader of the twelfth century how the poet came upon  the motives and episodes of his stories, whether he borrowed them or  invented them himself. Any poet should be judged not as a \"finder\"  but as a \"user\" of the common stock of ideas. The study of sources of  mediaeval poetry, which is being so doggedly carried on by scholars, may  well throw light upon the main currents of literary tradition, but it  casts no reflection, favourable or otherwise, upon the personal art of  the poet in handling his stuff. On that count he may plead his own cause  before the jury.    Chretien's originality, then, consists in his portrayal of the social  ideal of the French aristocracy in the twelfth century. So far as we  know he was the first to create in the vulgar tongues a vast court,  where men and women lived in conformity with the rules of courtesy,  where the truth was told, where generosity was open-handed, where the  weak and the innocent were protected by men who dedicated themselves to  the cult of honour and to the quest of a spotless reputation. Honour and  love combined to engage the attention of this society; these were  its religion in a far more real sense than was that of the Church.  Perfection was attainable under this code of ethics: Gawain, for  example, was a perfect knight. Though the ideals of this court and  those of Christianity are in accord at many points, vet courtly love and  Christian morality are irreconcilable. This Arthurian material, as used  by Chretien, is fundamentally immoral as judged by Christian standards.  Beyond question, the poets and the public alike knew this to be the  case, and therein lay its charm for a society in which the actual  relations or the sexes were rigidly prescribed by the Church and by  feudal practice, rather than by the sentiments of the individuals  concerned. The passionate love of Tristan for Iseut, of Lancelot for  Guinevere, of Cliges for Fenice, fascinate the conventional Christian  society of the twelfth century and of the twentieth century alike,  but there-is only one name among men for such relations as theirs, and  neither righteousness nor reason lie that way. Even Tennyson, in spite  of all he has done to spiritualise this material, was compelled to  portray the inevitable dissolution and ruin of Arthur's court. Chretien  well knew the difference between right and wrong, between reason and  passion, as the reader of \"Cliges\" may learn for himself. Fenice was not  Iseut, and she would not have her Cliges to be a Tristan. Infidelity,  if you will, but not \"menage a trois\". Both \"Erec\" and \"Yvain\" present  a conventional morality. But \"Lancelot\" is flagrantly immoral, and the  poet is careful to state that for this particular romance he is indebted  to his patroness Marie de Champagne. He says it was she who furnished  him with both the \"matiere\" and the \"san\", the material of the story and  its method of treatment.    Scholars have sought to fix the chronology of the poet's works, and have  been tempted to speculate upon the evolution of his literary and moral  ideas. Professor Foerster's chronology is generally accepted, and there  is little likelihood of his being in error when he supposes Chretien's  work to have been done as follows: the lost \"Tristan\" (the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#2)"],[1,"for you. But if you hit it not you are in for a sound  drubbing for your pertness.\"    \"Pick your own target,\" quoth Rob in a fine rage. \"I'll lay my head  against that purse that I can hit it.\"    \"It shall be as you say,\" retorted the Forester angrily, \"your head for  your sauciness that you hit not my target.\"    Now at a little rise in the wood a herd of deer came grazing by, distant  full fivescore yards. They were King's deer, but at that distance seemed  safe from any harm. The Head Forester pointed to them.    \"If your young arm could speed a shaft for half that distance, I'd shoot  with you.\"    \"Done!\" cried Rob. \"My head against twenty pennies I'll cause yon fine  fellow in the lead of them to breathe his last.\"    And without more ado he tried the string of his long bow, placed a shaft  thereon, and drew it to his ear. A moment, and the quivering string sang  death as the shaft whistled across the glade. Another moment and the  leader of the herd leaped high in his tracks and fell prone, dyeing the  sward with his heart's blood.    A murmur of amazement swept through the Foresters, and then a growl of  rage. He that had wagered was angriest of all.    \"Know you what you have done, rash youth?\" he said. \"You have killed a  King's deer, and by the laws of King Harry your head remains forfeit.  Talk not to me of pennies but get ye gone straight, and let me not look  upon your face again.\"    Rob's blood boiled within him, and he uttered a rash speech. \"I have  looked upon your face once too often already, my fine Forester. 'Tis you  who wear my father's shoes.\"    And with this he turned upon his heel and strode away.    The Forester heard his parting thrust with an oath. Red with rage he  seized his bow, strung an arrow, and without warning launched it full  af' Rob. Well was it for the latter that the Forester's foot turned on a  twig at the critical instant, for as it was the arrow whizzed by his ear  so close as to take a stray strand of his hair with it. Rob turned upon  his assailant, now twoscore yards away.    \"Ha!\" said he. \"You shoot not so straight as I, for all your bravado.  Take this from the tupenny bow!\"    Straight flew his answering shaft. The Head Forester gave one cry, then  fell face downward and lay still. His life had avenged Rob's father, but  the son was outlawed. Forward he ran through the forest, before the  band could gather their scattered wits--still forward into the great  greenwood. The swaying trees seemed to open their arms to the wanderer,  and to welcome him home.    Toward the close of the same day, Rob paused hungry and weary at the  cottage of a poor widow who dwelt upon the outskirts of the forest. Now  this widow had often greeted him kindly in his boyhood days, giving him  to eat and drink. So he boldly entered her door. The old dame was right  glad to see him, and baked him cakes in the ashes, and had him rest and  tell her his story. Then she shook her head.    \"'Tis an evil wind that blows through Sherwood,\" she said. \"The poor are  despoiled and the rich ride over their bodies. My three sons have been  outlawed for shooting King's deer to keep us from starving, and now hide  in the wood. And they tell me that twoscore of as good men as ever drew  bow are in hiding with them.\"    \"Where are they, good mother?\" cried Rob. \"By my faith, I will join  them.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" replied the old woman at first. But when she saw that there  was no other way, she said: \"My sons will visit me to-night. Stay you  here and see them if you must.\"    So Rob stayed willingly to see the widow's sons that night, for they  were men after his own heart. And when they found that his mood was with  them, they made him swear an oath of fealty, and told him the haunt of  the band--a place he knew right well. Finally one of them said:    \"But the band lacks a leader--one who can use his head as well as  his hand. So we have agreed that he who has skill enough to go to  Nottingham, an outlaw, and win the prize at archery, shall be our  chief.\"    Rob sprang to his feet. \"Said in good time!\" cried he, \"for I had  started to that self-same Fair, and all the Foresters, and all the  Sheriff's men in Christendom shall not stand between me and the center  of their target!\"    And though he was but barely grown he stood so straight and his eye  flashed with such fire that the three brothers seized his hand and  shouted:    \"A Lockesley! a Lockesley! if you win the golden arrow you shall be  chief of outlaws in Sherwood Forest!\"    So Rob fell to planning how he could disguise himself to go to  Nottingham town; for he knew that the Foresters had even then set a  price on his head in the market-place.    It was even as Rob had surmised. The Sheriff of Nottingham posted a  reward of two hundred pounds for the capture, dead or alive, of one  Robert Fitzooth, outlaw. And the crowds thronging the streets upon that  busy Fair day often paused to read the notice and talk together about  the death of the Head Forester.    But what with wrestling bouts and bouts with quarter-staves, and  wandering minstrels, there came up so many other things to talk about,  that the reward was forgotten for the nonce, and only the Foresters  and Sheriff's men watched the gates with diligence, the Sheriff indeed  spurring them to effort by offers of largess. His hatred of the father  had descended to the son.    The great event of the day came in the afternoon. It was the archer's  contest for the golden arrow, and twenty men stepped forth to shoot.  Among them was a beggar-man, a sorry looking fellow with leggings of  different colors, and brown scratched face and hands. Over a tawny shock  of hair he had a hood drawn, much like that of a monk. Slowly he limped  to his place in the line, while the mob shouted in derision. But the  contest was open to all comers, so no man said him nay.    Side by side with Rob--for it was he--stood a muscular fellow of swarthy  visage and with one eye hid by a green bandage. Him also the crowd  jeered, but he passed them by with indifference while he tried his bow  with practiced hand.    A great crowd had assembled in the amphitheater enclosing the lists. All  the gentry and populace of the surrounding country were gathered there  in eager expectancy. The central box contained the lean but pompous  Sheriff, his bejeweled wife, and their daughter, a supercilious young  woman enough, who, it was openly hinted, was hoping to receive the  golden arrow from the victor and thus be crowned queen of the day.    Next to the Sheriff's box was one occupied by the fat Bishop of  Hereford; while in the other side was a box wherein sat a girl whose  dark hair, dark eyes, and fair features caused Rob's heart to leap.  'Twas Maid Marian! She had come up for a visit from the Queen's court at  London town, and now sat demurely by her father the Earl of Huntingdon.  If Rob had been grimly resolved to win the arrow before, the sight of  her sweet face multiplied his determination an hundredfold. He felt his  muscles tightening into bands of steel, tense and true. Yet withal his  heart would throb, making him quake in a most unaccountable way.    Then the trumpet sounded, and the crowd became silent while the herald  announced the terms of the contest. The lists were open to all comers.  The first target was to be placed at thirty ells distance, and all those  who hit its center were allowed to shoot at the second target, placed  ten ells farther off. The third target was to be removed yet farther,  until the winner was proved. The winner was to receive the golden arrow,  and a place with the King's Foresters. He it was also who crowned the  queen of the day.    The trumpet sounded again, and the archers prepared to shoot. Rob looked  to his string, while the crowd smiled and whispered at the odd figure  he cut, with his vari-colored legs and little cape. But as the first man  shot, they grew silent.    The target was not so far but that twelve out of the twenty contestants  reached its inner circle. Rob shot sixth in the line and landed fairly,  being rewarded by an approving grunt from the man with the green  blinder, who shot seventh, and with apparent carelessness, yet true to  the bull's-eye.    The mob cheered and yelled themselves hoarse at this even marksmanship.  The trumpet sounded again, and a new target was set up at forty ells.    The first three archers again struck true, amid the loud applause of the  onlookers; for they were general favorites and expected to win. Indeed  'twas whispered that each was backed by one of the three dignitaries  of the day. The fourth and fifth archers barely grazed the center. Rob  fitted his arrow quietly and with some confidence sped it unerringly  toward the shining circle.    \"The beggar! the beggar!\" yelled the crowd; \"another bull for the  beggar!\" In truth his shaft was nearer the center than any of the  others. But it was not so near that \"Blinder,\" as the mob had promptly  christened his neighbor, did not place his shaft just within the mark.  Again the crowd cheered wildly. Such shooting as this was not seen every  day in Nottingham town.    The other archers in this round were disconcerted by the preceding  shots, or unable to keep the pace. They missed one after another and  dropped moodily back, while the trumpet sounded for the third round, and  the target was set up fifty ells distant.    \"By my halidom you draw a good bow, young master,\" said Rob's queer  comrade to him in the interval allowed for rest. \"Do you wish me to  shoot first on this trial?\"    \"Nay,\" said Rob, \"but you are a good fellow by this token, and if I win  not, I hope you may keep the prize from yon strutters.\" And he nodded  scornfully to the three other archers who were surrounded by their  admirers, and were being made much of by retainers of the Sheriff, the  Bishop, and the Earl. From them his eye wandered toward Maid Marian's  booth. She had been watching him, it"]]]
