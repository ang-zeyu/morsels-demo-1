Presently he heard a chuckling at his side.  Out of the corner of his eye he saw the black-haired man come into the  battle, straight and stiff as before, with long arms shooting out like  pistons.    It was a glorious sight. Something made Harrigan's heart big; rose and  swelled his throat; rose again and came as a wild yell upon his tongue.  The unfortunates who have faced Irish legions in battle know that yell.  The soldiers did not know it, and they held back for a moment.  Something else lowered their spirits still more. It was the clanging of  the police patrol as it swung to a halt and a body of reserves poured  out.    \"Here comes our finish!\" panted Harrigan to his comrade in arms. \"But  oh, man, I'm thinkin' it was swate while it lasted!\"    In his great moments the Irish brogue thronged thick upon his tongue.    \"Finish, hell!\" grunted the other. \"After me, lad!\"    And lowering his head like a bull, he drove forward against the crowd.  Harrigan caught the idea in a flash. He put his shoulder to the hip of  his friend. They became a flying wedge with the jabbing fists of the  black-haired man for a point--and they sank into the mass of soldiers  like a hot knife into butter, shearing them apart.    There were few who wished more action, for the police reserves were  capturing man after man. One or two resisted, but a revolver fired  straight in the air put a sudden period to such thoughts. The crowd  scattered in all directions and Harrigan was taking to his heels among  the rest when an iron hand caught his shoulder and jerked him to a  halt. It was the black-haired man.    \"Easy,\" he cautioned. He pulled a cap out and settled it upon his head.  Harrigan followed suit with his soft hat.    \"Are you after givin' yourself away to the law?\" he queried,  bewildered.    \"Steady, you fool,\" said the other; \"they're only after the ones who  run away.\"    An excited Kanaka confronted them with brandished club.    \"What's the cause of the disturbance, officer?\" asked the big man.    The policeman for answer waved them away and darted after a running  soldier.    \"I'll be damned!\" murmured Harrigan, and his eyes dwelt on his  companion's face almost tenderly.    They were at the edge of the crowd when a shrill voice called: \"Those  two big men! Halt 'em! Stand!\"    Officer Akana ran through the crowd with his regulation Colt brandished  above his head.    \"The time's come!\" said Harrigan's new friend, and broke into a run.          CHAPTER 2      They were past the thick of the mob now and they dodged rapidly among  the cottages until the clamor of police fell away to a murmur behind  them, and they swung out onto the narrow, dark street which led back  toward the heart of Honolulu. For ten minutes they strode along without  a word. Under the light of a street lamp they stopped of one accord.    \"I'm McTee.\"    \"I'm Harrigan.\"    The gripping of the hands was more than fellowship; it was like a test  of strength which left each uncertain of the other's resources. They  were exactly opposite types. McTee was long of face, with an arched,  cruel nose, gleaming eyes, heavy, straight brows which pointed up and  gave a touch of the Mephistophelian to his expression, a narrow,  jutting chin, and lips habitually compressed to a thin line. It was a  handsome face, in a way, but it showed such a brutal dominance that it  inspired fear first and admiration afterward.    Such a man must command. He might be only the boss of a gang of  laborers, or he might be a financier, but never in any case an  underling. Altogether he combined physical and intellectual strength to  such a degree that both men and women would have stopped to look at  him, and once seen he would be remembered.    On the other hand, in Harrigan one felt only force, not directed and  controlled as in McTee, but impulsive, irregular, irresponsible,  uncompassed. He carried a contradiction in his face. The heavy,  hard-cut jaw, the massive cheekbones, the stiff, straight upper lip  indicated merely brutal endurance and energy, but these qualities were  tempered by possibilities of tenderness about the lips and by the  singular lights forever changing in the blue eyes. He would be hard for  the shrewdest judge to understand, for the simple reason that he did  not know himself.    In looking at McTee, one asked: \"What is he?\" In looking at Harrigan,  the question was: \"What will he become?\"    \"Stayin' in town long?\" asked Harrigan, and his voice was a little  wistful.    \"I'm bound out tonight.\"    \"So long, then.\"    \"So long.\"    They turned on their heels into opposite streets without further words,  with no thanks given for service rendered, with no exchange of  congratulations for the danger they had just escaped. That parting  proved them hardened knights of the road which leads across the world  and never turns back home.    Harrigan strode on full of thought. His uncertain course brought him at  last to the waterfront, and he idled along the black, odorous docks  until he came to a pier where a ship was under steam, making ready to  put out to sea. The spur touched the heart of Harrigan. The urge never  failed to prick him when he heard the scream of a steamer's horn as it  put to sea. It brought the thoughts of far lands and distant cities.    He strolled out to the pier and watched the last ropes cast loose. The  ship was not large, and even in the dark it seemed dingy and  dilapidated. He guessed that, big or small, this boat would carry her  crew to some distant quarter of the world, and therefore to a place to  be desired.    A strong voice gave an order from the deck--a hard voice with a ring in  it like the striking of iron against iron. Harrigan glanced up with a  start of recognition, and by the light of a swinging lantern he saw  McTee. If he were in command, this ship was certainly going to a far  port. Black water showed between the dock and the ship. In a moment  more it would be beyond reach, and that thought decided Harrigan. He  made a few paces back, noted the aperture in the rail of the ship where  the gangplank was being drawn in, then ran at full speed and leaped  high in the air.    The three sailors at the rail shouted their astonishment as Harrigan  struck the edge of the gangplank, reeled, and then pitched forward to  his knees. He rose and shook himself like a cat that has dropped from a  high fence to the ground.    \"What're you?\"    \"I'm the extra hand.\"    And Harrigan ran up the steps to the bridge. There he found McTee with  the first and second mates.    \"McTee,\" he said, \"I came on your ship by chance an' saw you. If you  _can_ use an extra hand, let me stay. I'm footfree an' I need to be  movin' on.\"    Even through the gloom he caught the glint of the Scotchman's eye.    \"Get off the bridge!\" thundered McTee.    \"But I'm Harrigan, and--\"    McTee turned to his first and second mates.    \"Throw that man off the bridge!\" he ordered.    Harrigan didn't wait. He retreated down the steps to the deck and went  to the rail. A wide gap of swarthy water now extended between the ship  and the dock, but he placed his knee on the rail ready to dive. Then he  turned and stood with folded arms looking up to the bridge, for his  mind was dark with many doubts. He tapped a passing sailor on the  shoulder.    \"What sort of an old boy is the captain?\"    He made up his mind that according to the answer he would stay with the  ship or swim to the shore, but the sailor merely stared stupidly at him  for a moment and then grinned slowly. There might be malice, there  might be mere ridicule in that smile. He passed on before another  question could be asked.    \"Huh!\" grunted Harrigan. \"I stay!\"    He kept his eyes fixed on the bridge, remaining motionless at the rail  for an hour while the glow of Honolulu grew dimmer and dimmer past the  stern. There were lights in the after-cabin and he guessed that the  ship, in a small way, carried both freight and passengers. At last  McTee came down the steps to the deck and as he passed Harrigan  snapped: \"Follow me.\"    He led the way aft and up another flight of steps to the after-cabin,  unlocked a door, and showed Harrigan into the captain's room. Here he  took one chair and Harrigan dropped easily into another.    \"Now, what 'n hell was your line of thinkin', McTee,\" he began, \"when  you told me to--\"    \"Stand up!\" said McTee.    \"What?\"    \"Stand up!\"    Harrigan rose very slowly. His jaw was setting harder and harder, and  his face became grim.    \"Harrigan, you took a chance and came with me.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I didn't ask you to come.\"    \"Sure you didn't, but if you think you can treat me like a swine and  get away with it--\"    It was wonderful to see the eyes of McTee grow small. They seemed to  retreat until they became points of light shining from the deep shadow  of his brow. They were met by the cold, incurious light of Harrigan's  stare.    \"You're a hard man, Harrigan.\"    He made no answer, but listened to the deep thrum of the engines. It  seemed to him that the force which drove the ship was like a part of  McTee's will, a thing of steel.    \"And I'm a hard man, Harrigan. On this ship I'm king. There's no will  but my will; there's no right but my right; there's no law but my law.  Remember, on land we stood as equals. On this ship you stand and I  sit.\"    The thin lips did not curve, and yet they seemed to be smiling cruelly,  and the eyes were probing deep, deep, deep into Harrigan's soul,  weighing, measuring, searching.    \"When we reach land,\" said Harrigan, \"I got an idea I'll have to break  you.\"    He raised his hands, which trembled with the restrained power of his  arms, and moved them as though slowly breaking a stick of wood.    \"I've broken men-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#2)"],[1,"the Jewish people, which would rise as a single body in defense  of its religion; for he made no attempt to interfere either with Jewish  religious liberties, or with a worship that Cicero declared to be  \"incompatible with the majesty of the Empire.\"    [Footnote 1: Cicero, Pro Flacco, 69, and Ant. XVI. iv, 4.]    The Jews, however, were henceforth the clients, instead of the allies,  of Rome. Though Hyrcanus was recognized by Pompey as the high priest and  ethnarch of Judea, and his wily counselor, the Idumean Antipater, was  given a general power of administering the country, they were alike  subject to the governor of Syria, which was now constituted a Roman  province. Moreover, the Hellenistic cities along the coast of Palestine  and on the other side of Jordan, which had been subjugated by John  Hyrcanus and Alexander Jannaeus, were restored to independence, and  placed under special Roman protection, and the Jewish territory itself  was shortly thereafter split by the Roman governor Gabinius into five  toparchies, or provinces, each with a separate administration.    The guiding aim of the conqueror was to weaken the Oriental power (as  the Jews were regarded) and strengthen the Hellenistic element in the  country. The Jews were soon to feel the heavy hand and suffer the  insatiate greed of Rome. National risings were put down with merciless  cruelty, the Temple treasury was spoiled in 56 B.C.E. by the avaricious  Crassus, one of the triumvirate that divided the Roman Empire, when he  passed Jerusalem on his way to fight against the Parthians; even the  annual offering contributed voluntarily by the Jews of the Diaspora to  the Temple was seized by a profligate governor of Asia. The Roman  aristocrats during the last years of the Republic were a degenerate  body; they regarded a governorship as the opportunity of unlimited  extortion, the means of recouping themselves for all the gross expenses  incurred on attaining office, and of making themselves and their friends  affluent for the rest of their lives. And Judea was a fresh quarry.    A happier era seemed to be dawning for the Jews when Julius Caesar  became dictator. At the beginning of the civil war between him and  Pompey, Hyrcanus, at the instance of Antipater, prepared to support the  man to whom he owed his position; but when Pompey was murdered,  Antipater led the Jewish forces to the help of Caesar, who was hard  pressed at Alexandria. His timely help and his influence over the  Egyptian Jews recommended him to Caesar's favor, and secured for him an  extension of his authority in Palestine, and for Hyrcanus the  confirmation of his ethnarchy. Joppa was restored to the Hasmonean  domain, Judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to Rome,  and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed.  Caesar, too, whatever may have been his motive, showed favor to the Jews  throughout his Empire. Mommsen thinks that he saw in them an effective  leaven of cosmopolitanism and national decomposition, and to that intent  gave them special privileges; but this seems a perverse reason to assign  for the grant of the right to maintain in all its thoroughness their  national life, and for their exemption from all Imperial or municipal  burdens that would conflict with it. It is more reasonable to suppose  that, taking in this as in many other things a broader view than that of  his countrymen, Caesar recognized the weakness of a world-state whose  members were so denationalized as to have no strong feeling for any  common purpose, no passion of loyalty to any community, and he favored  Judaism as a counteracting force to this peril.    His various enactments constituted, as it were, a Magna Charta of the  Jews in the Empire; Judaism was a favored cult in the provinces, a  _licita religio_ in the capital. At Alexandria Caesar confirmed and  extended the religious and political privileges of the Jews, and ordered  his decree to be inscribed on pillars of brass and set up in a public  place. At Rome, though the devotees of Bacchus were forbidden to meet,  he permitted the Jews to hold their assemblies and celebrate their  ceremonials. At his instance the Hellenistic cities of Asia passed  similar favorable decrees for the benefit of the Jewish congregations in  their midst, which invested them with a kind of local autonomy. The  proclamation of the Sardians is typical. \"This decree,\" it runs, \"was  made by the senate and people, upon the representation of the praetors:    \"Whereas those Jews who are our fellow-citizens, and live with us in  this city, have ever had great benefits heaped upon them by the people,  and have come now into the senate, and desired of the people that, upon  the restitution of their law and their liberty by the senate and people  of Rome, they may assemble together according to their ancient legal  custom, and that we will not bring any suit against them about it; and  that a place may be given them where they may hold their congregations  with their wives and children, and may offer, as did their forefathers,  their prayers and sacrifices to God:--now the senate and people have  decreed to permit them to assemble together on the days formerly  appointed, and to act according to their own laws; and that such a place  be set apart for them by the praetors for the building and inhabiting  the same as they shall esteem fit for that purpose, and that those who  have control of the provisions of the city shall take care that such  sorts of food as they esteem fit for their eating may be imported into  the city.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Ant. XIV. x. 24.]    Caesar's decrees marked the culmination of Roman tolerance, and the Jews  enjoyed their privileges for but a short time. It is related by the  historian Suetonius that they lamented his death more bitterly than any  other class.[1] And they had good reason. The Republicans, who had  murdered him, and his ministers, who avenged him, vied with each other  for the support of the Jewish princes; but the people in Palestine  suffered from the burden that the rivals imposed on the provinces in  their efforts to raise armies. Antipater and his ambitious sons Herod  and Phasael contrived to maintain their tyranny amid the constant  shifting of power; and when the hardy mountaineers of Galilee strove  under the lead of one Hezekiah (Ezekias), the founder of the party of  the Zealots, to shake off the Roman yoke, Herod ruthlessly put down the  revolt. But when Antigonus, the son of that Aristobulus who had been  deprived of his kingdom by Hyrcanus and Pompey, roused the Parthians to  invade Syria and Palestine, the Jews eagerly rose in support of the  scion of the Maccabean house, and drove out the hated Idumeans with  their puppet Jewish king. The struggle between the people and the Romans  had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when placed on the throne by  the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the Jews, rejoicing at the  restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era of independence had  come.    [Footnote 1: Suetonius, Caesar, lxxxiv. 7.]    The infatuation of Mark Antony for Cleopatra enabled Antigonus to hold  his kingdom for three years (40-37 B.C.E.). Then Herod, who had escaped  to Rome, returned to Syria to conquer the kingdom that Antony had  bestowed on him. He brought with him the Roman legions, and for two  years a fierce struggle was waged between the Idumeans, Romans, and  Romanizing Jews on the one hand, and the national Jews and Parthian  mercenaries of Antigonus on the other. The struggle culminated in a  siege of Jerusalem. As happened in all the contests for the city, the  power of trained force in the end prevailed over the enthusiasm of  fervent patriots. Herod stormed the walls, put to death Antigonus and  his party, and established a harsher tyranny than even the Roman  conqueror had imposed. For over thirty years he held the people down  with the aid of Rome and his body-guard of mercenary barbarians. His  constitution was an autocracy, supplemented by assassination. In the  civil war between Antony and Octavian, he was first on the losing side,  as his father had been in the struggle between Pompey and Caesar; but,  like his father, he knew when to go over to the victor. The master of  the Roman Empire, henceforth known as Augustus, was so impressed with  his carriage and resolution that he not only confirmed him in his  kingdom, but added to it the territories of Chalcis and Perea to the  north and east of the Jordan. Throughout his reign Herod contrived to  preserve the friendship of Rome as effectually as he contrived to arouse  the hatred of his Jewish subjects. \"The Imperial Eagle and some  distinguished Roman or other,\" says George Adam Smith,[1] \"were always  fixed in Herod's heaven.\" He ruled with a strong but merciless hand. He  insured peace, and while he turned his own home into a slaughter-house,  he glorified the Jewish dominion outwardly to a height and magnificence  it had never before attained. Yet the Jewish deputation that went to  plead before Augustus on his death declared that \"Herod had put such  abuses on them as a wild beast would not have done, and no calamity they  had suffered was comparable with that which he had brought on the  nation.\"[2] Beneath the fine show of peace, splendor, and expansion, the  passions of the nation were being aroused to the breaking-point.    [Footnote 1: Jerusalem, ii. 504.]    [Footnote 2: Ant. XVII. xi. 2.]    Augustus himself, following the example of his uncle Julius Caesar, yet  lacking the same large tolerance, held towards Judaism an ambiguous  attitude of impartiality rather than of favor. He caused sacrifices to  be offered for himself at the Temple at Jerusalem,[1] but he praised his  nephew Gaius for having refrained from doing likewise during his Eastern  travels.[2] He was anxious that the national laws and customs of each  nation should be preserved, and he issued a "]]]
