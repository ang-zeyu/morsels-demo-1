The  scheme sounded fantastic, and was still cast in the mould of mediæval  aspirations. The kingdom of Naples had long been in dispute between the  houses of Arragon and Anjou. As heir to the Angevin line, Charles VIII.  proposed to satisfy national pride by the conquest of Naples. Then he  appealed to the old sentiment of Christendom by proclaiming his design  of advancing against Constantinople, expelling the Turk from Europe, and  realising the ideal of mediæval Christianity by planting once more the  standard of the Cross upon the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem.    The first part of his plan succeeded with a rapidity and ease that  bewildered the rest of Europe. The French conquest of Naples awakened  men to the danger which threatened them. France, as ruler of Naples,  could overrun the rest of Italy, and as master of the Pope could use the  authority of the head of Christendom to give legitimacy to further  schemes of aggression. A sense of common danger drew the other powers of  Europe together; and a League of Spain, the Empire, the Pope, Milan, and  Venice forced Charles VIII. to retire from Naples (1495), where the  French conquests were rapidly lost. A threat of his return next year led  to an emphatic renewal of the League and an assertion of the basis on  which it rested--\"the mutual preservation of states, so that the more  powerful might not oppress the less powerful, and that each should keep  what rightly belongs to him.\"    This League marks a new departure in European affairs. There was no  mention of the old ideas on which Europe was supposed to rest. There was  no recognition of papal or imperial supremacy; no principle of European  organisation was laid down. The existing state of things was to be  maintained, and the contracting powers were to decide amongst themselves  what rights and claims they thought fit to recognise. Such a plan might  be useful to check French preponderance at the moment, but it was fatal  to the free development of Europe. The states that were then powerful  might grow in power; those that were not yet strong were sure to be  prevented from growing stronger. Dynastic interests were set up as  against national interests. European affairs were to be settled by  combinations of powerful states.    The results of this system were rapidly seen. France, of course, was  checked for the time; but France, in its turn, could enter the League  and become a factor in European combinations. The problem now for  statesmen was how to use this concert of Europe for their own interests.  Dynastic considerations were the most obvious means of gaining powerful  alliances. Royal marriages became matters of the greatest importance,  because a lucky union of royal houses might secure a lasting  preponderance. The Emperor Maximilian married his son Philip to a  daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Death removed the nearer heirs to  the Spanish rulers, and the son of Philip was heir to Austria, the  Netherlands, and the Spanish kingdoms. The notion of a maintenance of  European equilibrium faded away before such a prospect.    This prospect, however, was only in the future. For the present there  was an opportunity for endless scheming. The European League for the  preservation of the existing state of things resisted any expansion on  the part of smaller states, but encouraged compacts for aggression  amongst the more powerful. France, Spain, and Germany had each of them a  national existence, while Italy consisted of a number of small states.  If Italy was to survive it was necessary that she should follow the  example of her powerful neighbours, and consolidate herself as they had  done. The only state which was at that time likely to unite Italy was  Venice; and Venice, in consequence, became the object of universal  jealousy. The concert of Europe was applied to the Venetian question,  and discovered a solution of the simplest sort. Instead of allowing  Venice to unite Italy, it was judged better to divide Venice. A secret  agreement was made between Spain, France, the Emperor, and the Pope that  they would attack Venice simultaneously, deprive her of her possessions,  and divide them amongst themselves. There was no lack of claims and  titles to the possessions which were thus to be acquired. The powers of  Europe, being judges in their own cause, could easily state their  respective pleas and pronounce each other justified. The League of  Cambrai, which was published at the end of 1508, was the first great  production of the new system of administering public law in Europe.    Anything more iniquitous could scarcely be conceived. Venice deserved  well at the hands of Europe. She had developed a great system of  commerce with the East; she was the chief bulwark against the advance of  the Turkish power; she was the one refuge of Italian independence. Those  very reasons marked her out for pillage by the powers who, claiming to  act in the interests of Europe, interpreted these interests according to  their own selfishness. Each power hoped to appropriate some of the  profits of Venetian commerce; each power wished for a slice of the  domains of Italy. What the Turk did was a matter of little consequence;  he was not the object of immediate dread.    This League of Cambrai witnessed the assimilation by the new system of  the relics of the old. Imperial and papal claims were set in the  foreground. Venice was excommunicated by the Pope, because she had the  audacity to refuse to give up to him at once his share of the booty. The  iniquities of the European concert were flimsily concealed by the rags  of the old system of the public law of Europe, which only meant that the  Pope and the Emperor were foremost in joining in the general scramble.  France was first in the field against Venice, and consequently France  was the chief gainer. Pope Julius II., having won from Venice all that  he could claim, looked with alarm on the increase of the French power in  Italy. As soon as he had satisfied himself, and had reduced Venice to  abject submission, his one desire was to rid himself of his troublesome  allies. The papal authority in itself could no longer influence European  politics; but it could give a sanction to new combinations which  interested motives might bring about. With cynical frankness the Papacy,  powerless in its own resources, used its privileged position to further  its temporal objects. We cannot wonder that Louis XII. of France tried  to create a schism, and promoted the holding of a general council. We  are scarcely surprised that the fantastic brain of the Emperor  Maximilian formed a scheme of becoming the Pope's coadjutor, and finally  annexing the papal to the imperial dignity. On every side the old  landmarks of Europe were disappearing, and the future was seen to belong  to the strong hand and the adventurous wit.    During the reign of Henry VII. England had stood aloof from these  complicated intrigues. Indeed England could not hope to make her voice  heard in the affairs of Europe. The weak government of Henry VI., and  the struggles between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, had reduced  her to political exhaustion. While France and Spain had grown into  strong kingdoms, England had dwindled into a third-rate power. Henry  VII. had enough to do in securing his own throne against pretenders, and  in reducing the remnants of the feudal nobility to obedience. He so far  worked in accordance with the prevailing spirit that he steadily  increased the royal power. He fell in with the temper of the time, and  formed matrimonial alliances which might bear political fruits. He gave  his daughter in marriage to the King of Scotland, in the hopes of  thereby bringing the Scottish Crown into closer relation with England.  He sought for a connexion with Spain by marrying his eldest son Arthur  to Katharine, a daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, and on Arthur's  untimely death Katharine became the wife of his next son Henry. Further,  Henry VII. gave his general approval to the League of 1496; he joined  it, but would promise no armed aid nor money. In short, he did enough to  claim for England a place in the new system of the European  commonwealth, though he himself declined to take any active part in the  activity that was consequently developed. He was old before his years,  and was unequal to any additional labour. He had saved his reputation by  his cautious and skilful policy at home. The statesmen of Europe  respected him for what he had done already, but they did not expect him  to do anything more. He had secured his dynasty, reduced his lands to  order, favoured its commerce, and secured for it peace. He had lived  frugally and had saved money, which was not the fortune of the more  adventurous princes. England was looked upon with an eye of  condescending favour by the great powers of Europe. Her population was  small, about three millions and a half; her military forces had not been  trained in the new methods of European warfare; her navy was not kept up  on a war footing. She could not rank higher than a third-rate power.    So England stood when Henry VII. died, and was succeeded by his son  Henry VIII., a youth of nineteen. We may indulge ourselves, if we  choose, in speculations on the probable effects if Henry VIII. had been  content to pursue his father's policy. The picture of England, peaceful  and contented while the rest of Europe is engaged in wasteful and wicked  war, is attractive as an ideal in English politics. England in the  sixteenth century might have stood aloof from European affairs, and  might have prospered in her own fashion. But one thing is certain, that  she would never have become the England of to-day; the New World, and  the possessions of the British Empire, would have been divided between  France and Spain;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#2)"],[1,"were set out,--a custom new to Eliphalet,--\"Ephum, some of that very  particular Colonel Crittenden sent me over from Kentucky last week.\"    An old darkey, with hair as white as the Colonel's, appeared from behind  the partition.    \"I 'lowed you'd want it, Marse Comyn, when I seed de Cap'n comin',\" said  he, with the privilege of an old servant. Indeed, the bottle was beneath  his arm.    The Colonel smiled.    \"Hope you'se well, Cap'n,\" said Ephum, as he drew the cork.    \"Tolluble, Ephum,\" replied the Captain. \"But, Ephum--say, Ephum!\"    \"Yes, sah.\"    \"How's my little sweetheart, Ephum?\"    \"Bress your soul, sah,\" said Ephum, his face falling perceptibly, \"bress  your soul, sah, Miss Jinny's done gone to Halcyondale, in Kaintuck, to  see her grandma. Ole Ephum ain't de same nigger when she's away.\"    The young Captain's face showed as much disappointment as the darkey's.    \"Cuss it!\" said he, strongly, \"if that ain't too bad! I brought her a  Creole doll from New Orleans, which Madame Claire said was dressed finer  than any one she'd ever seen. All lace and French gewgaws, Colonel. But  you'll send it to her?\"    \"That I will, Lige,\" said the Colonel, heartily. \"And she shall write  you the prettiest note of thanks you ever got.\"    \"Bless her pretty face,\" cried the Captain. \"Her health, Colonel! Here's  a long life to Miss Virginia Carvel, and may she rule forever! How old  did you say this was?\" he asked, looking into the glass.    \"Over half a century,\" said Colonel Carvel.    \"If it came from the ruins of Pompeii,\" cried Captain Brent, \"it might  be worthy of her!\"    \"What an idiot you are about that child, Lige,\" said the Colonel, who  was not hiding his pleasure. The Colonel could hide nothing. \"You ruin  her!\"    The bluff young Captain put down his glass to laugh.    \"Ruin her!\" he exclaimed. \"Her pa don't ruin her I eh, Ephum? Her pa  don't ruin her!\"    \"Lawsy, Marse Lige, I reckon he's wuss'n any.\"    \"Ephum,\" said the Colonel, pulling his goatee thoughtfully, \"you're a  damned impertinent nigger. I vow I'll sell you South one of these days.  Have you taken that letter to Mr. Renault?\" He winked at his friend as  the old darkey faded into the darkness of the store, and continued: \"Did  I ever tell you about Wilson Peale's portrait of my grandmother, Dorothy  Carvel, that I saw this summer at my brother Daniel's, in Pennsylvania?  Jinny's going to look something like her, sir. Um! She was a fine woman.  Black hair, though. Jinny's is brown, like her Ma's.\" The Colonel handed  a cigar to Captain Brent, and lit one himself. \"Daniel has a book my  grandfather wrote, mostly about her. Lord, I remember her! She was  the queen-bee of the family while she lived. I wish some of us had her  spirit.\"    \"Colonel,\" remarked Captain Lige, \"what's this I heard on the levee just  now about your shootin' at a man named Babcock on the steps here?\"    The Colonel became very grave. His face seemed to grow longer as he  pulled his goatee.    \"He was standing right where you are, sir,\" he replied (Captain Lige  moved), \"and he proposed that I should buy his influence.\"    \"What did you do?\"    Colonel Carvel laughed quietly at the recollection    \"Shucks,\" said he, \"I just pushed him into the streets gave him a little  start, and put a bullet past his ear, just to let the trash know the  sound of it. Then Russell went down and bailed me out.\"    The Captain shook with laughter. But Mr. Eliphalet Hopper's eyes were  glued to the mild-mannered man who told the story, and his hair rose  under his hat.    \"By the way, Lige, how's that boy, Tato? Somehow after I let you have  him on the 'Louisiana', I thought I'd made a mistake to let him run the  river. Easter's afraid he'll lose the little religion she taught him.\"    It was the Captain's turn to be grave.    \"I tell you what, Colonel,\" said he; \"we have to have hands, of course.  But somehow I wish this business of slavery had never been started!\"    \"Sir,\" said the Colonel, with some force, \"God made the sons of Ham the  servants of Japheth's sons forever and forever.\"    \"Well, well, we won't quarrel about that, sir,\" said Brent, quickly.  \"If they all treated slaves as you do, there wouldn't be any cry  from Boston-way. And as for me, I need hands. I shall see you again,  Colonel.\"    \"Take supper with me to-night, Lige,\" said Mr. Carvel. \"I reckon you'll  find it rather lonesome without Jinny.\"    \"Awful lonesome,\" said the Captain. \"But you'll show me her letters,  won't you?\"    He started out, and ran against Eliphalet.    \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Who's this?\"    \"A young Yankee you landed here this morning, Lige,\" said the Colonel.  \"What do you think of him?\"    \"Humph!\" exclaimed the Captain.    \"He has no friends in town, and he is looking for employment. Isn't that  so, sonny?\" asked the Colonels kindly.    \"Yes.\"    \"Come, Lige, would you take him?\" said Mr. Carvel.    The young Captain looked into Eliphalet's face. The dart that shot  from his eyes was of an aggressive honesty; and Mr. Hopper's, after an  attempt at defiance, were dropped.    \"No,\" said the Captain.    \"Why not, Lige?\"    \"Well, for one thing, he's been listening,\" said Captain Lige, as he  departed.    Colonel Carvel began to hum softly to himself:--        \"'One said it was an owl, and the other he said nay,       One said it was a church with the steeple torn away,       Look a' there now!'    \"I reckon you're a rank abolitionist,\" said he to Eliphalet, abruptly.    \"I don't see any particular harm in keepin' slaves,\" Mr. Hopper replied,  shifting to the other foot.    Whereupon the Colonel stretched his legs apart, seized his goatee,  pulled his head down, and gazed at him for some time from under his  eyebrows, so searchingly that the blood flew to Mr. Hopper's fleshy  face. He mopped it with a dark-red handkerchief, stared at everything  in the place save the gentleman in front of him, and wondered whether he  had ever in his life been so uncomfortable. Then he smiled sheepishly,  hated himself, and began to hate the Colonel.    \"Ever hear of the Liberator?\"    \"No, sir,\" said Mr. Hopper.    \"Where do you come from?\" This was downright directness, from which  there was no escape.    \"Willesden, Massachusetts.\"    \"Umph! And never heard of Mr. Garrison?\"    \"I've had to work all my life.\"    \"What can you do, sonny?\"    \"I cal'late to sweep out a store. I have kept books,\" Mr. Hopper  vouchsafed.    \"Would you like work here?\" asked the Colonel, kindly. The green eyes  looked up swiftly, and down again.    \"What'll you give me?\"    The good man was surprised. \"Well,\" said he, \"seven dollars a week.\"    Many a time in after life had the Colonel reason to think over this  scene. He was a man the singleness of whose motives could not be  questioned. The one and sufficient reason for giving work to a homeless  boy, from the hated state of the Liberator, was charity. The Colonel had  his moods, like many another worthy man.    The small specks on the horizon sometimes grow into the hugest of  thunder clouds. And an act of charity, out of the wisdom of God, may  produce on this earth either good or evil.    Eliphalet closed with the bargain. Ephum was called and told to lead  the recruit to the presence of Mr. Hood, the manager. And he spent the  remainder of a hot day checking invoices in the shipping entrance on  Second Street.    It is not our place here to chronicle Eliphalet's faults. Whatever he  may have been, he was not lazy. But he was an anomaly to the rest of the  young men in the store, for those were days when political sentiments  decided fervent loves or hatreds. In two days was Eliphalet's reputation  for wisdom made. During that period he opened his mouth to speak but  twice. The first was in answer to a pointless question of Mr. Barbo's  (aetat 25), to the effect that he, Eliphalet Hopper, was a Pierce  Democrat, who looked with complacency on the extension of slavery.  This was wholly satisfactory, and saved the owner of these sentiments  a broken head. The other time Eliphalet spoke was to ask Mr. Barbo to  direct him to a boardinghouse.    \"I reckon,\" Mr. Barbo reflected, \"that you'll want one of them  Congregational boarding-houses. We've got a heap of Yankees in the town,  and they all flock together and pray together. I reckon you'd ruther go  to Miss Crane's nor anywhere.\"    Forthwith to Miss Crane's Eliphalet went. And that lady, being a Greek  herself, knew a Greek when she saw one. The kind-hearted Barbo lingered  in the gathering darkness to witness the game which ensued, a game dear  to all New Englanders, comical to Barbo. The two contestants calculated.  Barbo reckoned, and put his money on his new-found fellow-clerk.  Eliphalet, indeed, never showed to better advantage. The shyness he  had used with the Colonel, and the taciturnity practised on his  fellow-clerks, he slipped off like coat and waistcoat for the battle.  The scene was in the front yard of the third house in Dorcas Row.  Everybody knows where Dorcas Row was. Miss Crane, tall, with all the  severity of side curls and bombazine, stood like a stone lioness at the  gate. In the background, by the steps, the boarders sat, an interested  group. Eliphalet girded up his loins, and sharpened his nasal twang to  cope with hers. The preliminary sparring was an exchange of compliments,  and deceived neither party. It seemed rather to heighten mutual respect.    \"You be from Willesden, eh?\" said Crane. \"I calculate you know the  Salters.\"    If the truth were known, this evidence of an apparent omniscience rather  staggered Eliphalet. But training stood by him, and he showed no dismay.  Yes, he knew the Salters, and had drawed many a load out of Hiram  Salters' wood-lot to help pay for his schooling.    \"Let me see,\" said Miss Crane, innocently; \"who was it one of them  Salters girls married, and lived across the way from the meetin'-house?\"    \"Spauldin',\" was the prompt reply.    \"Wal, I want t' "]]]
