His lean face was pale; and his hair flamed with redoubled ardor  on that account. Never was hair as red as that, not even the hair of  Lord Nick, said the people in Milligan's this night.    He was perfectly calm even in the midst of that deadly silence. He stood  looking about him. He saw Gloster, the real estate man, and bowed to him  deliberately.    For some reason that drew a gasp.    Then he observed a table which was apparently to his fancy and crossed  the floor with a light, noiseless step, big George padding heavily  behind him. At the little round table he waited until George had drawn  out the chair for him and then he sat down. He folded his arms lightly  upon his breast and once more surveyed the scene, and big George drew  himself up behind Donnegan. Just once his eyes rolled and flashed  savagely in delight at the sensation that they were making, then the  face of George was once again impassive.    If Donnegan had not carried it off with a certain air, the whole  entrance would have seemed decidedly stagey, but The Corner, as it was,  found much to wonder at and little to criticize. And in the West grown  men are as shrewd judges of affectation as children are in other places.    \"Putting on a lot of style, eh?\" said Jack Landis, and with fierce  intensity he watched the face of Nelly Lebrun.    For once she was unguarded.    \"He's superb!\" she exclaimed. \"The big fellow is going to bring a drink  for him.\"    She looked up, surprised by the silence of Landis, and found that his  face was actually yellow.    \"I'll tell you something. Do you remember the little red-headed tramp  who came in here the other night and spoke to me?\"    \"Very well. You seemed to be bothered.\"    \"Maybe. I dunno. But that's the man--the one who's sitting over there  now all dressed up--the man The Corner is talking about--Donnegan! A  tramp!\"    She caught her breath.    \"Is that the one?\" A pause. \"Well, I believe it. He's capable of  anything!\"    \"I think you like him all the better for knowing that.\"    \"Jack, you're angry.\"    \"Why should I be? I hate to see you fooled by the bluff of a tramp,  though.\"    \"Tush! Do you think I'm fooled by it? But it's an interesting bluff,  Jack, don't you think?\"    \"Nelly, he's interesting enough to make you blush; by heaven, the hound  is lookin' right at you now, Nelly!\"    He had pressed her suddenly against the wall and she struck back  desperately in self-defense.    \"By the way, what did he want to see you about?\"    It spiked the guns of Landis for the time being, at least. And the girl  followed by striving to prove that her interest in Donnegan was purely  impersonal.    \"He's clever,\" she ran on, not daring to look at the set face of her  companion. \"See how he fails to notice that he's making a sensation?  You'd think he was in a big restaurant in a city. He takes the drink off  the tray from that fellow as if it were a common thing to be waited on  by a body-servant in The Corner. Jack, I'll wager that there's something  crooked about him. A professional gambler, say!\"    Jack Landis thawed a little under this careless chatter. He still did  not quite trust her.    \"Do you know what they're whispering? That I was afraid to face him!\"    She tilted her head back, so that the light gleamed on her young throat,  and she broke into laughter.    \"Why, Jack, that's foolish. You proved yourself when you first came to  The Corner. Maybe some of the newcomers may have said something, but all  the old-timers know you had some different reason for leaving the rest  of them. By the way, what was the reason?\"    She sent a keen little glance at him from the corner of her eyes, but  the moment she saw that he was embarrassed and at sea because of the  query she instantly slipped into a fresh tide of careless chatter and  covered up his confusion for him.    \"See how the girls are making eyes at him.\"    \"I'll tell you why,\" Jack replied. \"A girl likes to be with the man  who's making the town talk.\" He added pointedly: \"Oh, I've found that  out!\"    She shrugged that comment away.    \"He isn't paying the slightest attention to any of them,\" she murmured.  \"He's queer! Has he just come here hunting trouble?\"          20      It should be understood that before this the men in Milligan's had  reached a subtly unspoken agreement that red-haired Donnegan was not one  of them. In a word, they did not like him because he made a mystery of  himself. And, also, because he was different. Yet there was a growing  feeling that the shooting of Lewis through the hand had not been an  accident, for the whole demeanor of Donnegan composed the action of a  man who is a professional trouble maker. There was no reason why he  should go to Milligan's and take his servant with him unless he wished a  fight. And why a man should wish to fight the entire Corner was  something no one could guess.    That he should have done all this merely to focus all eyes upon him, and  particularly the eyes of a girl, did not occur to anyone. It looked  rather like the bravado of a man who lived for the sake of fighting.  Now, men who hunt trouble in the mountain desert generally find all that  they may desire, but for the time being everyone held back, wolfishly,  waiting for another to take the first step toward Donnegan. Indeed,  there was an unspoken conviction that the man who took the first step  would probably not live to take another. In the meantime both men and  women gave Donnegan the lion's share of their attention. There was only  one who was clever enough to conceal it, and that one was the pair of  eyes to which the red-haired man was playing--Nelly Lebrun. She confined  herself strictly to Jack Landis.    So it was that when Milligan announced a tag dance and the couples  swirled onto the floor gayly, Donnegan decided to take matters into his  own hands and offer the first overt act. It was clumsy; he did not like  it; but he hated this delay. And he knew that every moment he stayed on  there with big George behind his chair was another red rag flaunted in  the face of The Corner.    He saw the men who had no girl with them brighten at the announcement of  the tag dance. And when the dance began he saw the prettiest girls  tagged quickly, one after the other. All except Nelly Lebrun. She swung  securely around the circle in the big arms of Jack Landis. She seemed to  be set apart and protected from the common touch by his size, and by his  formidable, challenging eye. Donnegan felt as never before the  unassailable position of this fellow; not only from his own fighting  qualities, but because he had behind him the whole unfathomable power of  Lord Nick and his gang.    Nelly approached in the arms of Landis in making the first circle of the  dance floor; her eyes, grown dull as she surrendered herself wholly to  the rhythm of the waltz, saw nothing. They were blank as unlighted  charcoal. She came opposite Donnegan, her back was toward him; she swung  in the arms of Landis, and then, past the shoulder of her partner, she  flashed a glance at Donnegan. The spark had fallen on the charcoal, and  her eyes were aflame. Aflame to Donnegan; the next instant the veil had  dropped across her face once more.    She was carried on, leaving Donnegan tingling.    A wise man upon whom that look had fallen might have seen, not Nelly  Lebrun in the cheap dance hall, but Helen of Sparta and all Troy's dead.  But Donnegan was clever, not wise. And he saw only Nelly Lebrun and the  broad shoulders of Jack Landis.    Let the critic deal gently with Donnegan. He loved Lou Macon with all  his heart and his soul, and yet because another beautiful girl had  looked at him, there he sat at his table with his jaw set and the devil  in his eye. And while she and Landis were whirling through the next  circumference of the room, Donnegan was seeing all sides of the problem.  If he tagged Landis it would be casting the glove in the face of the big  man--and in the face of old Lebrun--and in the face of that mysterious  and evil power, Lord Nick himself. And consider, that besides these he  had already insulted all of The Corner.    Why not let things go on as they were? Suppose he were to allow Landis  to plunge deeper into his infatuation? Suppose he were to bring Lou  Macon to this place and let her see Landis sitting with Nelly, making  love to her with every tone in his voice, every light in his eye? Would  not that cure Lou? And would not that open the door to Donnegan?    And remember, in considering how Donnegan was tempted, that he was not a  conscientious man. He was in fact what he seemed to be--a wanderer, a  careless vagrant, living by his wits. For all this, he had been touched  by the divine fire--a love that is greater than self. And the more  deeply he hated Landis, the more profoundly he determined that he should  be discarded by Nelly and forced back to Lou Macon. In the meantime,  Nelly and Jack were coming again. They were close; they were passing;  and this time her eye had no spark for Donnegan.    Yet he rose from his table, reached the floor with a few steps, and  touched Landis lightly on the shoulder. The challenge was passed. Landis  stopped abruptly and turned his head; his face showed merely dull  astonishment. The current of dancers split and washed past on either  side of the motionless trio, and on every face there was a glittering  curiosity. What would Landis do?    Nothing. He was too stupefied to act. He, Jack Landis, had actually been  tagged while he was dancing with the woman which all The Corner knew to  be his girl! And before his befogged senses cleared the girl was in the  arms of the red-haired man and was lost in the crowd.    What a buzz went around the room! For a moment Landis could no more move  than he could think; then he sent a sullen glance toward the girl and  retreated to their table.

And was this semblance thine?\"  So gaz'd I then  Adoring; for the charity of him,  Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy'd,  Stood lively before me.  \"Child of grace!\"  Thus he began: \"thou shalt not knowledge gain  Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held  Still in this depth below.  But search around  The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy  Seated in state, the queen, that of this realm  Is sovran.\"  Straight mine eyes I rais'd; and bright,  As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime  Above th' horizon, where the sun declines;  To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale  To mountain sped, at th' extreme bound, a part  Excell'd in lustre all the front oppos'd.  And as the glow burns ruddiest o'er the wave,  That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton  Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light  Diminish'd fades, intensest in the midst;  So burn'd the peaceful oriflame, and slack'd  On every side the living flame decay'd.  And in that midst their sportive pennons wav'd  Thousands of angels; in resplendence each  Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee  And carol, smil'd the Lovely One of heav'n,  That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.    Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,  As is the colouring in fancy's loom,  'T were all too poor to utter the least part  Of that enchantment.  When he saw mine eyes  Intent on her, that charm'd him, Bernard gaz'd  With so exceeding fondness, as infus'd  Ardour into my breast, unfelt before.          CANTO XXXII    Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,  Assum'd the teacher's part, and mild began:  \"The wound, that Mary clos'd, she open'd first,  Who sits so beautiful at Mary's feet.  The third in order, underneath her, lo!  Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,  Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,  Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs  Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.  All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,  Are in gradation throned on the rose.  And from the seventh step, successively,  Adown the breathing tresses of the flow'r  Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.  For these are a partition wall, whereby  The sacred stairs are sever'd, as the faith  In Christ divides them.  On this part, where blooms  Each leaf in full maturity, are set  Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ'd.  On th' other, where an intersected space  Yet shows the semicircle void, abide  All they, who look'd to Christ already come.  And as our Lady on her glorious stool,  And they who on their stools beneath her sit,  This way distinction make: e'en so on his,  The mighty Baptist that way marks the line  (He who endur'd the desert and the pains  Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,  Yet still continued holy), and beneath,  Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,  Thus far from round to round.  So heav'n's decree  Forecasts, this garden equally to fill.  With faith in either view, past or to come,  Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves  Midway the twain compartments, none there are  Who place obtain for merit of their own,  But have through others' merit been advanc'd,  On set conditions: spirits all releas'd,  Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.  And, if thou mark and listen to them well,  Their childish looks and voice declare as much.    \"Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;  And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein  Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee.  From this realm  Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,  No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can.  A law immutable hath establish'd all;  Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,  Exactly, as the finger to the ring.  It is not therefore without cause, that these,  O'erspeedy comers to immortal life,  Are different in their shares of excellence.  Our Sovran Lord--that settleth this estate  In love and in delight so absolute,  That wish can dare no further--every soul,  Created in his joyous sight to dwell,  With grace at pleasure variously endows.  And for a proof th' effect may well suffice.  And 't is moreover most expressly mark'd  In holy scripture, where the twins are said  To, have struggled in the womb.  Therefore, as grace  Inweaves the coronet, so every brow  Weareth its proper hue of orient light.  And merely in respect to his prime gift,  Not in reward of meritorious deed,  Hath each his several degree assign'd.  In early times with their own innocence  More was not wanting, than the parents' faith,  To save them: those first ages past, behoov'd  That circumcision in the males should imp  The flight of innocent wings: but since the day  Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites  In Christ accomplish'd, innocence herself  Must linger yet below.  Now raise thy view  Unto the visage most resembling Christ:  For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win  The pow'r to look on him.\"  Forthwith I saw  Such floods of gladness on her visage shower'd,  From holy spirits, winging that profound;  That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,  Had not so much suspended me with wonder,  Or shown me such similitude of God.  And he, who had to her descended, once,  On earth, now hail'd in heav'n; and on pois'd wing.  \"Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,\" sang:  To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,  From all parts answ'ring, rang: that holier joy  Brooded the deep serene.  \"Father rever'd:  Who deign'st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,  Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!  Say, who that angel is, that with such glee  Beholds our queen, and so enamour'd glows  Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems.\"  So I again resorted to the lore  Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary's charms  Embellish'd, as the sun the morning star;  Who thus in answer spake: \"In him are summ'd,  Whatever of buxomness and free delight  May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:  And so beseems: for that he bare the palm  Down unto Mary, when the Son of God  Vouchsaf'd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.  Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,  And note thou of this just and pious realm  The chiefest nobles.  Those, highest in bliss,  The twain, on each hand next our empress thron'd,  Are as it were two roots unto this rose.  He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste  Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,  That ancient father of the holy church,  Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys  Of this sweet flow'r: near whom behold the seer,  That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times  Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails  Was won.  And, near unto the other, rests  The leader, under whom on manna fed  Th' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.  On th' other part, facing to Peter, lo!  Where Anna sits, so well content to look  On her lov'd daughter, that with moveless eye  She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos'd  To the first father of your mortal kind,  Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,  When on the edge of ruin clos'd thine eye.    \"But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)  Here break we off, as the good workman doth,  That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:  And to the primal love our ken shall rise;  That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far  As sight can bear thee.  Yet, alas! in sooth  Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,  Thou backward fall'st.  Grace then must first be gain'd;  Her grace, whose might can help thee.  Thou in prayer  Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,  Attend, and yield me all thy heart.\"  He said,  And thus the saintly orison began.          CANTO XXXIII    \"O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,  Created beings all in lowliness  Surpassing, as in height, above them all,  Term by th' eternal counsel pre-ordain'd,  Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc'd  In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,  Himself, in his own work enclos'd to dwell!  For in thy womb rekindling shone the love  Reveal'd, whose genial influence makes now  This flower to germin in eternal peace!  Here thou to us, of charity and love,  Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,  To mortal men, of hope a living spring.  So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,  That he who grace desireth, and comes not  To thee for aidance, fain would have desire  Fly without wings.  Nor only him who asks,  Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oft  Forerun the asking.  Whatsoe'er may be  Of excellence in creature, pity mild,  Relenting mercy, large munificence,  Are all combin'd in thee.  Here kneeleth one,  Who of all spirits hath review'd the state,  From the world's lowest gap unto this height.  Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace  For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken  Toward the bliss supreme.  And I, who ne'er  Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,  Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,  (And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive  Each cloud of his mortality away;  That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.  This also I entreat of thee, O queen!  Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou  Wouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve  Affection sound, and human passions quell.  Lo!  Where, with Beatrice, many a saint  Stretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit!\"    The eyes, that heav'n with love and awe regards,  Fix'd on the suitor, witness'd, how benign  She looks on pious pray'rs: then fasten'd they  On th' everlasting light, wherein no eye  Of creature, as may well be thought, so far  Can travel inward.  I, meanwhile, who drew  Near to the limit, where all wishes end,  The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),  Ended within me.
