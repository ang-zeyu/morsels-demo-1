He must, however, have been living for  a long time in Pomerania at the time he wrote, as he even more frequently  uses Low-German expressions, such as occur in contemporary native  Pomeranian writers.    Since he sprang from an ancient noble family, as he says on several  occasions, it is possible that some particulars relating to the  Schweidlers might be discovered in the family records of the seventeenth  century which would give a clew to his native country; but I have sought  for that name in all the sources of information accessible to me, in vain,  and am led to suspect that our author, like many of his contemporaries,  laid aside his nobility and changed his name when he took holy orders.    I will not, however, venture on any further conjectures; the manuscript,  of which six chapters are missing, begins with the words \"Imperialists  plundered,\" and evidently the previous pages must have contained an  account of the breaking out of the Thirty Years' War in the island of  Usedom. It goes on as follows:--    \"Coffers, chests, and closets were all plundered and broken to pieces,  and my surplice also was torn, so that I remained in great distress and  tribulation. But my poor little daughter they did not find, seeing that  I had hidden her in the stable, which was dark, without which I doubt  not they would have made my heart heavy indeed. The lewd dogs would even  have been rude to my old maid Ilse, a woman hard upon fifty, if an old  cornet had not forbidden them. Wherefore I gave thanks to my Maker when  the wild guests were gone, that I had first saved my child from their  clutches, although not one dust of flour, nor one grain of corn, one  morsel of meat even of a finger's length was left, and I knew not how I  should any longer support my own life, and my poor child's. _Item_, I  thanked God that I had likewise secured the _vasa sacra_, which I had  forthwith buried in the church in front of the altar, in presence of the  two churchwardens, Hinrich Seden and Claus Bulken, of Uekeritze,  commending them to the care of God. And now because, as I have already  said, I was suffering the pangs of hunger, I wrote to his lordship the  Sheriff Wittich V. Appelmann, at Pudgla, that for the love of God and  his holy Gospel he should send me that which his highness' grace  Philippus Julius had allowed me as _praestanda_ from the convent at  Pudgla, to wit, thirty bushels of barley and twenty-five marks of  silver, which, howbeit his lordship had always withheld from me hitherto  (for he was a very hard inhuman man, as he despised the holy Gospel and  the preaching of the Word, and openly, without shame, reviled the  servants of God, saying that they were useless feeders, and that Luther  had but half cleansed the pigstye of the Church--God mend it!). But he  answered me nothing, and I should have perished for want if Hinrich  Seden had not begged for me in the parish. May God reward the honest  fellow for it in eternity! Moreover, he was then growing old, and was  sorely plagued by his wicked wife Lizzie Kolken. Methought when I  married them that it would not turn out over well, seeing that she was  in common report of having long lived in unchastity with Wittich  Appelmann, who had ever been an arch-rogue, and especially an arrant  whoremaster, and such the Lord never blesses. This same Seden now  brought me five loaves, two sausages, and a goose, which old goodwife  Paal, at Loddin, had given him; also a flitch of bacon from the farmer  Jack Tewert. But he said I must shield him from his wife, who would have  had half for herself, and when he denied her she cursed him, and wished  him gout in his head, whereupon he straightway felt a pain in his right  cheek, and it was quite hard and heavy already. At such shocking news I  was affrighted, as became a good pastor, and asked whether peradventure  he believed that she stood in evil communication with Satan, and could  bewitch folks? But he said nothing, and shrugged his shoulders. So I  sent for old Lizzie to come to me, who was a tall, meagre woman of about  sixty, with squinting eyes, so that she could not look any one in the  face; likewise with quite red hair, and indeed her goodman had the same.  But though I diligently admonished her out of God's Word, she made no  answer until at last I said, 'Wilt thou unbewitch thy goodman (for I  saw from the window how that he was raving in the street like a madman),  or wilt thou that I should inform the magistrate of thy deeds?' Then,  indeed, she gave in, and promised that he should soon be better (and so  he was); moreover she begged that I would give her some bread and some  bacon, inasmuch as it was three days since she had a bit of anything to  put between her lips, saving always her tongue. So my daughter gave her  half a loaf, and a piece of bacon about two handsbreadths large; but she  did not think it enough, and muttered between her teeth; whereupon my  daughter said, 'If thou art not content, thou old witch, go thy ways and  help thy goodman; see how he has laid his head on Zabel's fence, and  stamps with his feet for pain.' Whereupon she went away, but still kept  muttering between her teeth, 'Yea, forsooth, I will help him and thee  too.'\"          _The Seventh Chapter_      HOW THE IMPERIALISTS ROBBED ME OF ALL THAT WAS LEFT, AND LIKEWISE BROKE  INTO THE CHURCH AND STOLE THE _VASA SACRA_; ALSO WHAT MORE BEFELL US    After a few days, when we had eaten almost all our food, my last cow fell  down dead (the wolves had already devoured the others, as mentioned  above), not without a strong suspicion that Lizzie had a hand in it,  seeing that the poor beast had eaten heartily the day before; but I leave  that to a higher judge, seeing that I would not willingly calumniate any  one; and it may have been the will of God, whose wrath I have well  deserved. _Summa_, I was once more in great need, and my daughter Mary  pierced my heart with her sighs, when the cry was raised that another  troop of Imperialists was come to Uekeritze, and was marauding there more  cruelly than ever, and, moreover, had burnt half the village. Wherefore I  no longer thought myself safe in my cottage; and after I had commended  everything to the Lord in a fervent prayer, I went up with my daughter and  old Ilse into the Streckelberg, where I already had looked out for  ourselves a hole like a cavern, well grown over with brambles, against the  time when the troubles should drive us thither. We therefore took with us  all we had left to us for the support of our bodies, and fled into the  woods, sighing and weeping, whither we soon were followed by the old men,  and the women and children; these raised a great cry of hunger when they  saw my daughter sitting on a log and eating a bit of bread and meat, and  the little things came with their tiny hands stretched out and cried \"Have  some too, have some too.\" Therefore, being justly moved by such great  distress, I hindered not my daughter from sharing all the bread and meat  that remained among the hungry children. But first I made them pray--\"The  eyes of all wait upon thee\"; upon which words I then spake comfortably to  the people, telling them that the Lord, who had now fed their little  children, would find means to fill their own bellies, and that they must  not be weary of trusting in him.    This comfort did not, however, last long; for after we had rested within  and around the cavern for about two hours, the bells in the village began  to ring so dolefully that it went nigh to break all our hearts, the more  as loud firing was heard between-whiles; _item_, the cries of men and the  barking of dogs resounded, so that we could easily guess that the enemy  was in the village. I had enough to do to keep the women quiet, that they  might not by their senseless lamentations betray our hiding-place to the  cruel enemy; and more still when it began to smell smoky, and presently  the bright flames gleamed through the trees. I therefore sent old Paasch  up to the top of the hill, that he might look around and see how matters  stood, but told him to take good care that they did not see him from the  village, seeing that the twilight had but just begun.    This he promised, and soon returned with the news that about twenty  horsemen had galloped out of the village towards the Damerow, but that  half the village was in flames. _Item_, he told us that by a wonderful  dispensation of God a great number of birds had appeared in the  juniper-bushes and elsewhere, and that if we could catch them they would be  excellent food for us. I therefore climbed up the hill myself, and having  found everything as he had said, and also perceived that the fire had, by  the help of God's mercy, abated in the village; _item_, that my cottage  was left standing, far beyond my merits and deserts; I came down again and  comforted the people, saying, \"The Lord hath given us a sign, and he will  feed us, as he fed the people of Israel in the wilderness; for he has sent  us a fine flight of fieldfares across the barren sea, so that they whirr  out of every bush as ye come near it. Who will now run down into the  village, and cut off the mane and tail of my dead cow which lies out behind  on the common?\" (for there was no horsehair in all the village, seeing that  the enemy had long since carried off or stabbed all the horses). But no one  would go, for fear was stronger even than hunger, till my old Ilse spoke,  and said, \"I will go, for I fear nothing, when I walk in the ways of God;  only give me a good stick.\" When old Paasch had lent her his staff, she  began to sing, \"God the Father be with us,\" and was soon out of sight among  the bushes. Meanwhile I exhorted the people to set to work directly, and to  cut little wands for springes, and to gather berries while the moon still  shone; there were a great quantity of mountain-ash and elder-bushes all  about"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#2)"],[1,"ent, and the Norman bishops and nobles  hurried across the seas in a panic. For years now the king has left  all matters in the hands of Harold, and is well content if only he  can fast and pray like any monk, and give all his thoughts and  treasure to the building of yonder abbey.\"    \"We want neither a monk nor a Norman over us,\" the smith said  roughly, \"still less one who is both Norman and monk I would rather  have a Dane, like Canute, who was a strong man and a firm one, than  this king, who, I doubt not, is full of good intentions, and is a  holy and pious monarch, but who is not strong enough for a ruler.  He leaves it to another to preserve England in peace, to keep in  order the great Earls of Mercia and the North, to hold the land  against Harold of Norway, Sweyn, and others, and, above all, to  watch the Normans across the water. A monk is well enough in a  convent, but truly 'tis bad for a country to have a monk as its  king.\"    \"There have been some war-loving prelates, Ulred; men  as ambitious as any of the great earls, and more dangerous,  because they have learning.\"    \"Ay, there have been great prelates,\" the smith agreed. \"Look at  Lyfing of Worcester, to whom next only to Godwin the king owed his  throne. He was an Englishman first and a bishop afterwards, and was  a proof, if needed, that a man can be a great churchman and a great  patriot and statesman too. It was he rather than Godwin who overcame  the opposition of the Danish party, and got the Witan at last to  acquiesce in the choice of London and Wessex, and to give their  vote to Edward.    \"Well was it he did so. For had he failed we should have had as  great a struggle in England as when Alfred battled against the  Danes. We of London and the men of Wessex under the great Earl were  bent upon being ruled by a prince of our own blood. The last two  Danish kings had shown us that anything is better than being governed  by the Northmen. It was Lyfing who persuaded the Earl of Mercia to  side with Wessex rather than with Northumbria, but since Lyfing,  what great Englishman have we had in the church? Every bishopric  was granted by Edward to Norman priests, until Godwin and his sons  got the upper hand after their exile. Since then most of them have  been given to Germans. It would seem that the king was so set against  Englishmen that only by bringing in foreigners can Harold prevent  all preferment going to Normans. But what is the consequence? They  say now that our church is governed from Rome, whereas before  Edward's time we Englishmen did not think of taking our orders from  Italy.    \"There will trouble come of it all, neighbour. Perhaps not so long  as Edward reigns, but at his death. There is but one of the royal  race surviving, and he, like Edward, has lived all his life abroad.  There can be no doubt what the choice of Englishmen will be. Harold  has been our real ruler for years. He is wise and politic as well  as brave, and a great general. He is our own earl, and will assuredly  be chosen. Then we shall have trouble with the Normans. Already  they bear themselves as if they were our masters, and they will not  give up their hold without a struggle. Men say that William, their  duke, makes no secret of his hope to become master of England, in  which case God help us all. But that won't come as long as Harold  lives and Englishmen can wield sword and battle-axe. As for myself,  I have patched many a Norman suit of armour, but, by St. Swithin,  I shall have far more pleasure in marring than I have ever had in  mending them.\"    \"Know you who were the boys who had that contention just now?\"    \"The Norman is a page of William, our Norman bishop; I know no more  of him than that the other is Wulf, who is a ward and page of Earl  Harold. His father was thane of Steyning in South Sussex, one of  Godwin's men, and at his death two years ago Harold took the lad  into his household, for he bore great affection for Gyrth, who had  accompanied him in his pilgrimage to Rome, and fought by his side  when he conquered the Welsh. It was there Gyrth got the wound that  at last brought about his death. Wulf has been to my smithy many  times, sometimes about matters of repairs to arms, but more often,  I think, to see my son Osgod. He had seen him once or twice in  calling at the shop, when one day Osgod, who is somewhat given to  mischief, was playing at ball, and drove it into the face of a son  of one of the Norman lords at court. The boy drew his dagger, and  there would have been blood shed, but Wulf, who was passing at the  time, and saw that the thing was a pure mishap and not the result  of set intention, threw himself between them.    \"There was a great fuss over it, for the boy took his tale to his  father, who demanded that Osgod should be punished, and would  doubtless have gained his end had not Wulf spoken to Earl Harold,  who intervened in the matter and persuaded the Norman to let it  drop. Since then the boys have been great friends in their way.  Osgod is a year older than the young thane, and has already made  up his mind to be his man when he grows up, and he has got me to  agree to it, though I would rather that he had stuck to my handicraft.  Still, the prospect is not a bad one. Harold will be King of England,  Wulf will be a powerful thane, and will doubtless some day hold  high place at court, and as he seems to have taken a real liking  to Osgod, the boy may have good chances.    \"Wulf will make a good fighting man one of these days. Harold sees  that all his pages are well instructed in arms, and the two boys  often have a bout with blunted swords when Wulf comes to my smithy;  and, by my faith, though I have taught Osgod myself, and he already  uses his arms well, the young thane is fully a match for him. You  would hardly believe that the boy can read as well as a monk, but  it is so. Earl Harold, you know, thinks a good deal of education,  and has founded a college at Waltham. He persuaded Wulf's father  to send him there, and, indeed, will take none as his pages unless  they can read. I see not what good reading can do to most men, but  doubtless for one who is at court and may hold some day a high post  there, it is useful to be able to read deeds and grants of estates,  instead of having to trust others' interpretation.\"    \"I wondered to see you press forward so suddenly into the crowd,  neighbour, seeing that you are a busy man, but I understand now  that you had an interest in the affair.\"    \"That had I. I was holding myself in readiness, if that Norman boy  drew his dagger, to give him such a blow across the wrist with my  cudgel that it would be long before he handled a weapon again. I  fear Wulf has got himself into trouble. The bishop will doubtless  complain to the king of the language used by one of Harold's pages,  and though the earl is well able to see that no harm comes to the  lad, it is likely he will send him away to his estates for a time.  For he strives always to avoid quarrels and disputes, and though  he will not give way a jot in matters where it seems to him that  the good of the realm is concerned, he will go much farther lengths  than most men would do in the way of conciliation. Look how he has  borne with Tostig and with the Earls of Mercia. He seems to have  no animosity in his nature, but is ready to forgive all injuries  as soon as pardon is asked.\"    The smith was not far wrong in his opinion as to what was likely  to happen. As soon as Wulf returned to the palace he was told that  the earl desired his presence, and he proceeded at once to the  apartment where Harold transacted public business. It was a hall  of considerable size; the floor was strewed with rushes; three  scribes sat at a table, and to them the earl dictated his replies  and decisions on the various matters brought before him. When he  saw Wulf enter he rose from his seat, and, beckoning to him to  follow, pushed aside the hangings across a door leading to an  apartment behind and went in. Wulf had no fear whatever of any  severe consequence to himself from his quarrel with Walter Fitz-Urse,  but he was ashamed that his thoughtlessness should have given the  slightest trouble to the earl, for, popular as he was among all  classes of men in southern England, Harold was an object of love  as well as respect to his dependents, and indeed to all who came  in close contact with him.    The earl was now forty-one years of age. He was very tall, and was  considered the strongest man in England. His face was singularly  handsome, with an expression of mingled gentleness and firmness.  His bearing was courteous to all. He united a frank and straightforward  manner with a polished address rare among his rough countrymen.  Harold had travelled more and farther than any Englishman of his  age. He had visited foreign courts and mingled with people more  advanced in civilization than were those of England or Normandy,  and was centuries ahead of the mass of his countrymen. He was an  ardent advocate of education, a strong supporter of the national  church, an upholder of the rights of all men, and although he  occasionally gave way to bursts of passion, was of a singularly  sweet and forgiving disposition.    King Edward was respected by his people because, coming after two  utterly worthless kings, he had an earnest desire for their good,  although that desire seldom led to any very active results. He was  a member of their own royal house. He was deeply religious. His  life was pure and simple, and although all his tastes and sympathies  were with the land in which he had been brought up, Englishmen  forgave him this because at least he was a Saxon, while his  predecessors had been Danes. But while they respected Edward, for  Harold, their real ruler, they felt a passionate admiration. He was  a worthy representative of all that was best in the Saxon character.  He possessed in an eminent degree the openness of"]]]
