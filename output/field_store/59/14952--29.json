It is a field which has  been neglected by anthologists and essayists; one of its few serious  recognitions being in a certain \"Treatise of Figurative Language,\"  which says: \"Nonsense; shall we dignify that with a place on our list?  Assuredly will vote for doing so every one who hath at all duly  noticed what admirable and wise uses it can be, and often is, put to,  though never before in rhetoric has it been so highly honored. How  deeply does clever or quaint nonsense abide in the memory, and for  how many a decade--from earliest youth to age's most venerable years.\"    And yet Hazlitt's \"Studies in Jocular Literature\" mentions six  divisions of the Jest, and omits Nonsense!    Perhaps, partly because of such neglect, the work of the best  nonsense writers is less widely known than it might be.    But a more probable reason is that the majority of the reading world  does not appreciate or enjoy real nonsense, and this, again, is  consequent upon their inability to discriminate between nonsense of  integral merit and simple chaff.      A jest's prosperity lies in the ear    Of him that hears it. Never in the tongue    Of him that makes it,    and a sense of nonsense is as distinct a part of our mentality as a  sense of humor, being by no means identical therewith.    It is a fad at present for a man to relate a nonsensical story, and  then, if his hearer does not laugh, say gravely: \"You have no sense  of humor. That is a test story, and only a true humorist laughs at it.\"  Now, the hearer may have an exquisite sense of humor, but he may be  lacking in a sense of nonsense, and so the story gives him no  pleasure. De Quincey said, \"None but a man of extraordinary talent  can write first-rate nonsense.\" Only a short study of the subject is  required to convince us that De Quincey was right; and he might have  added, none but a man of extraordinary taste can appreciate  first-rate nonsense. As an instance of this, we may remember that  Edward Lear, \"the parent of modern nonsense-writers,\" was a talented  author and artist, and a prime favorite of such men as Tennyson and  the Earls of Derby; and John Ruskin placed Lear's name at the head  of his list of the best hundred authors.    \"Don't tell me,\" said William Pitt, \"of a man's being able to talk  sense; every one can talk sense. Can he talk nonsense?\"    The sense of nonsense enables us not only to discern pure nonsense,  but to consider intelligently nonsense of various degrees of purity.  Absence of sense is not necessarily nonsense, any more than absence  of justice is injustice.    Etymologically speaking, nonsense may be either words without meaning,  or words conveying absurd or ridiculous ideas. It is the second  definition which expresses the great mass of nonsense literature,  but there is a small proportion of written nonsense which comes  under the head of language without meaning.    Again, there are verses composed entirely of meaningless words,  which are not nonsense literature, because they are written with  some other intent.    The nursery rhyme, of which there are almost as many versions as  there are nurseries,      Eena, meena, mona, mi,    Bassalona, bona, stri,    Hare, ware, frown, whack,    Halico balico, we, wi, we, wack,    is not strictly a nonsense verse, because it was invented and used  for \"counting out,\" and the arbitrary words simply take the place of  the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.    Also, the nonsense verses with which students of Latin composition  are sometimes taught to begin their efforts, where words are used  with no relative meaning, simply to familiarize the pupil with the  mechanical values of quantity and metre, are not nonsense. It is  only nonsense for nonsense' sake that is now under our consideration.    Doubtless the best and best-known example of versified words without  meaning is \"Jabberwocky.\" Although (notwithstanding Lewis Carroll's  explanations) the coined words are absolutely without meaning, the  rhythm is perfect and the poetic quality decidedly apparent, and the  poem appeals to the nonsense lover as a work of pure genius. Bayard  Taylor is said to have recited \"Jabberwocky\" aloud for his own  delectation until he was forced to stop by uncontrollable laughter.  To us who know our _Alice_ it would seem unnecessary to quote this  poem, but it is a fact that among the general reading community the  appreciators of Lewis Carroll are surprisingly few. An editor of a  leading literary review, when asked recently if he had read  \"Alice in Wonderland,\" replied, \"No, but I mean to. It is by the  author of 'As in a looking-Glass,' is it not?\"    But of far greater interest and merit than nonsense of words, is  nonsense of ideas. Here, again, we distinguish between nonsense and  no sense. Ideas conveying no sense are often intensely funny, and  this type is seen in some of the best of our nonsense literature.    A perfect specimen is the bit of evidence read by the White Rabbit  at the Trial of the Knave of Hearts.[1] One charm of these verses is  the serious air of legal directness which pervades their ambiguity,  and another is the precision with which the metrical accent  coincides exactly with the natural emphasis. They are marked, too,  by the liquid euphony that always distinguishes Lewis Carroll's  poetry.    A different type is found in verses that refer to objects in terms  the opposite of true, thereby suggesting ludicrous incongruity, and  there is also the nonsense verse that uses word effects which have  been confiscated by the poets and tacitly given over to them.    A refrain of nonsense words is a favorite diversion of many  otherwise serious poets.      With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,    is one of Shakespeare's many musical nonsense refrains.    [Footnote 1: \"She's all my Fancy painted him,\" page 20.]    Burns gives us:      Ken ye aught o' Captain Grose?        Igo and ago,    If he's 'mang his freens or foes?        Iram, coram, dago.    Is he slain by Highlan' bodies?        Igo and ago;    And eaten like a weather haggis?        Iram, coram, dago.    Another very old refrain runs thus:      Forum, corum, sunt di-vorum,        Harum, scarum, divo;    Tag-rag, merry-derry, periwig and hat-band,        Hic, hoc, horum, genitivo.    An old ballad written before the Reformation has for a refrain:        Sing go trix,        Trim go trix,    Under the greenwood tree.    While a celebrated political ballad is known by its nonsense chorus,      Lilliburlero bullin a-la.    Mother Goose rhymes abound in these nonsense refrains, and they are  often fine examples of onomatopoeia.    By far the most meritorious and most interesting kind of nonsense is  that which embodies an absurd or ridiculous idea, and treats it with  elaborate seriousness. The greatest masters of this art are  undoubtedly Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll. These Englishmen were men  of genius, deep thinkers, and hard workers.    Lear was an artist draughtsman, his subjects being mainly  ornithological and zoological. Lewis Carroll (Charles L. Dodgson)  was an expert in mathematics and a lecturer on that science in  Christ Church, Oxford.    Both these men numbered among their friends many of the greatest  Englishmen of the day. Tennyson was a warm friend and admirer of each,  as was also John Ruskin.

The engine is of the triple expansion type; the  diameters of the cylinders being 6-1/2, 10 and 16 inches respectively.    Are you not pleased with this piece of machinery, so elegantly finished  and neatly polished? From it you can conclude that the yacht is capable of  running with considerable speed, amounting to thirteen miles an hour, if  desired.    Let us descend to the cabin next; can anything be more tasteful and  convenient? Is it not luxurious? And, although small, does not its very  limited space astonish you when you view so many comforts? This is the  dining-room. What can be more complete! Just look at this side-board, with  its sumptuous outfit in silver and crystal. _A multum in parvo._    The kitchen is admirably arranged; the spacious refrigerator making it  possible that a considerable amount of all sorts of provisions and  delicacies can be kept on board for some time.    Let us peep into the cozy staterooms. Are they not nicely furnished?  Glance at the large and comfortable berths, which can be extended so as to  form double berths, as in a Pullman car. All the rooms receive light,  either through side-windows or from the upper deck. Every facility for  enjoying open air exercise is offered by the main deck running the whole  length of the ship. The portion pertaining to the stern is especially  commodious, and constituted our dining-room on pleasant days. Even when  the weather was unfavorable, the awnings which inclosed this delightful  place formed an excellent shelter, giving the impression we were living in  a large tent.    Thus, you observe, that nothing is omitted to secure comfort. Do you see  this electric bell? Well, all the staterooms are provided with such bells,  which are connected with the steward's pantry.    Now, let us go forward. These two doors form the entrance to the  pilot-house; please, step in. Here is the steering wheel, and by means of  these brass tubes the steersman communicates with the engineer. Look up  to the ceiling. It is decorated with multitudinous charts and maps. Before  we leave this room do not forget to glance at the mariner's compass in its  elegant brass case.    Close by is the entrance to the fore-castle, which contains the men's  berths. The crew occupying them consists of the captain, the engineer, the  cook, the steward, and the seamen.    There not being accommodation for more female servants, Mrs. James was  attended by only one maid. She, however, could easily spare larger  retinue, because this excellent girl has assisted her mistress in  performing the manifold domestic duties for more than fourteen years, and  during this long period Mrs. James has learned to value her for her  dexterity in all female occupations. She is also a faithful guardian of  the children for whom she tenderly cares.    Flattering myself that I have given my kind readers a satisfactory,  introductory description, I shall now advance with the narrative, and  proceed on our journey, traversing the longest artificial waterway ever  constructed by human hands; and sailing on the unsteady billows of the  great lakes, which contain the largest amount of sweet water on the globe,  in order to visit the World's Fair, the grandest and most complete  exposition that human eyes ever beheld.        CHAPTER I.    VOYAGE ON THE ERIE CANAL FROM JULY 22ND, 10.40 A.M., TILL JULY 29TH, 1.30  P.M.      Finally, the 22nd of July, the day appointed for our departure, had  arrived. Great was my satisfaction to find the auspices predicting fine  weather; and, indeed, it was as beautiful as if Heaven smiled on our  enterprise. When taking leave of my neighbors, it was not at all with a  sad sentiment, for I had been well aware that I was going to undertake a  trip which but few mortals are so fortunate as to participate.    Accompanied by my dear parents I went to Dock street, where the  \"Marguerite\" lay all ready for leaving the flourishing city of  Schenectady.    My mother, whose domestic duties recalled her to the hearth at home, was  compelled to leave me, while my father remained on board the yacht,  anxious to enjoy my company as long as circumstances would permit.  Therefore, he gladly accepted Mr. James's kind invitation to accompany us  on our journey for a short distance.    Three intimate friends of Mr. James and his family were also invited  guests on the boat. These temporary traveling companions were Dr. A.  Veeder, Lawyer Charles Hastings and Congressman S.J. Schermerhorn, three  well known and highly estimated gentlemen from Schenectady.    At 11.40 A.M., Mr. James gave orders to haul in the lines attaching the  boat to the shore; and a gun-shot at departing announced to the numerous  spectators that the \"Marguerite\" was on the point to set out for her  unusual, but most interesting trip.    We had been sailing only a very short distance, and were just facing the  buildings of the General Electric Company, when our attention was  attracted by a photographer who seemed to be very desirous of taking a  photo of the yacht and her passengers; for he aspired to gain the most  favorable posture, apparently quite a task under the circumstances. How  well he succeeded in his endeavors, the readers can judge for themselves  by glancing at the frontispiece of this book.    Resuming our journey, we soon had opportunity to admire the beautiful and  fertile Mohawk Valley, once the home of one of the tribes composing the  Five Nations. Arendt Van Curler, the noble founder of the \"Place Beyond  the Pines,\" pronounced this picturesque region the most beautiful the eye  of man had ever beheld, at a time when the country was yet in its infancy.  Though great changes have taken place since that remote date (1642), the  grandeur of the scenes spread before us evidently showed that the country  has lost little of its beauty, even at the present day, nothwithstanding  the white man has established in many places his smoking factories and  noisy looms.    At the second lock Mr. Schermerhorn, who owns a beautiful residence near  this place, in the Township of Rotterdam, joined our party, whereupon we  continued sailing on the smooth surface of the canal with accelerated  speed.    At 2.40 P.M., after having passed five locks, we approached _Amsterdam_,  an enterprising and prosperous city of over 20,000 inhabitants, located in  the midst of romantic scenery. We halted at Port Jackson for a few  minutes, since this was the terminus of the voyage of Mr. Hastings and my  father.    When parting with me, my father said:    \"This short tour has sufficed me to perceive how delightful your voyage  promises to be in company with this amiable family. Thus I leave you,  feeling very happy that so many pleasures and enjoyments are awaiting  you.\"    I answered his kind words with a hearty parting kiss, as a token of my  filial love.    The two gentlemen, after having abandoned the yacht, ascended the bridge  that spans the canal at that point; and bidding us farewell once more,  they pursued us with their eyes until the graceful lines of the  \"Marguerite\" had become invisible in the distance.    Continuing our voyage, I was in perfect rapture with the ever varying  magnificence of the luxuriant Mohawk Valley. In the afternoon the sky  became overcast and the quietude that had been prevailing was interrupted  by a thunder-clap, which gave us the signal to prepare for a shower. After  the expiration of a few minutes the full-charged clouds poured their  deluge upon mother earth. This natural phenomenon, however, was only of  short duration; but sufficient to render the atmosphere most delightfully  pure and refreshing. It was now a redoubled pleasure to view the many  hills and dales, adorned in every shade of verdure, varying with romantic  forest scenes; all mingling into one inexpressibly rich garniture in which  Nature had royally clad herself in order to give us greeting on our way.    As we reached Fultonville, a suburban village of Fonda, about twenty-six  miles from Schenectady, Dr. Veeder and Congressman Schermerhorn parted  with us, wishing us a pleasurable voyage.    The \"Marguerite,\" gliding along, neared the vicinity of Sprakers when  suddenly the \"heaven grew black again with the storm-cloud's frown,\" and a  flash of lightning illuminated the sky with crimson radiance. It is for a  moment as if the horizon was in flames, a spectacle glorious to behold.  Another minute and a peal of thunder reaches our ears. Then the dark,  heavy clouds discharge their contents in copious abundance.       \"In grateful silence earth receives        The general blessing: fresh and fair      Each flower expands its little leaves        As glad the common joy to share.\"    While it is still raining,       \"The sun breaks forth, from off the scene        Its floating veil of mist is flung.      And all the wilderness of green        With trembling drops of light is hung.\"    A magnificent rainbow, spanning the boundless arch on high, embellishes  this superb panorama.    As the sunset was bathing all summits in soft, crimson light, and the pale  lustre of the orbed moon appeared in the east, we arrived at  _Canajoharie_.    This small town, noted for its fine stone quarries, was chosen for our  abode over Sunday, and busy hands carried out the order to safely moor our  craft near the bridge pertaining to the main street.    When taking a long walk about the town, I found that, although inferior in  size, it is a very desirable place for summer residences; being  beautifully situated on romantic slopes crowned with elegant and tasty  villas.    Canajoharie is regularly and appropriately laid out with wide, well kept  and adequately lighted thoroughfares, and many citizens reside in spacious  and architecturally ornamented houses. It is a recognized center of trade,  from which agricultural products of all kinds are shipped.    In the first "]]]
