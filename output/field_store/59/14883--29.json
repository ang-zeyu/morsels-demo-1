[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#2)"],[1,"er's boy, was engaged in putting up the net. Mr. Jackson  believed in private coaching; and every spring since Joe, the eldest  of the family, had been able to use a bat a man had come down from the  Oval to teach him the best way to do so. Each of the boys in turn had  passed from spectators to active participants in the net practice in  the meadow. For several years now Saunders had been the chosen man,  and his attitude towards the Jacksons was that of the Faithful Old  Retainer in melodrama. Mike was his special favourite. He felt that in  him he had material of the finest order to work upon. There was  nothing the matter with Bob. In Bob he would turn out a good, sound  article. Bob would be a Blue in his third or fourth year, and probably  a creditable performer among the rank and file of a county team later  on. But he was not a cricket genius, like Mike. Saunders would lie  awake at night sometimes thinking of the possibilities that were in  Mike. The strength could only come with years, but the style was there  already. Joe's style, with improvements.    Mike put on his pads; and Marjory walked with the professional to the  bowling crease.    \"Mike's going to Wrykyn next term, Saunders,\" she said. \"All the boys  were there, you know. So was father, ages ago.\"    \"Is he, miss? I was thinking he would be soon.\"    \"Do you think he'll get into the school team?\"    \"School team, miss! Master Mike get into a school team! He'll be  playing for England in another eight years. That's what he'll be  playing for.\"    \"Yes, but I meant next term. It would be a record if he did. Even Joe  only got in after he'd been at school two years. Don't you think he  might, Saunders? He's awfully good, isn't he? He's better than Bob,  isn't he? And Bob's almost certain to get in this term.\"    Saunders looked a little doubtful.    \"Next term!\" he said. \"Well, you see, miss, it's this way. It's all  there, in a manner of speaking, with Master Mike. He's got as much  style as Mr. Joe's got, every bit. The whole thing is, you see, miss,  you get these young gentlemen of eighteen, and nineteen perhaps, and  it stands to reason they're stronger. There's a young gentleman,  perhaps, doesn't know as much about what I call real playing as Master  Mike's forgotten; but then he can hit 'em harder when he does hit 'em,  and that's where the runs come in. They aren't going to play Master  Mike because he'll be in the England team when he leaves school.  They'll give the cap to somebody that can make a few then and there.\"    \"But Mike's jolly strong.\"    \"Ah, I'm not saying it mightn't be, miss. I was only saying don't  count on it, so you won't be disappointed if it doesn't happen. It's  quite likely that it will, only all I say is don't count on it. I only  hope that they won't knock all the style out of him before they're  done with him. You know these school professionals, miss.\"    \"No, I don't, Saunders. What are they like?\"    \"Well, there's too much of the come-right-out-at-everything about 'em  for my taste. Seem to think playing forward the alpha and omugger of  batting. They'll make him pat balls back to the bowler which he'd cut  for twos and threes if he was left to himself. Still, we'll hope for  the best, miss. Ready, Master Mike? Play.\"    As Saunders had said, it was all there. Of Mike's style there could be  no doubt. To-day, too, he was playing more strongly than usual.  Marjory had to run to the end of the meadow to fetch one straight  drive. \"He hit that hard enough, didn't he, Saunders?\" she asked, as  she returned the ball.    \"If he could keep on doing ones like that, miss,\" said the  professional, \"they'd have him in the team before you could say  knife.\"    Marjory sat down again beside the net, and watched more hopefully.          CHAPTER II    THE JOURNEY DOWN      The seeing off of Mike on the last day of the holidays was an imposing  spectacle, a sort of pageant. Going to a public school, especially at  the beginning of the summer term, is no great hardship, more  particularly when the departing hero has a brother on the verge of the  school eleven and three other brothers playing for counties; and Mike  seemed in no way disturbed by the prospect. Mothers, however, to the  end of time will foster a secret fear that their sons will be bullied  at a big school, and Mrs. Jackson's anxious look lent a fine solemnity  to the proceedings.    And as Marjory, Phyllis, and Ella invariably broke down when the time  of separation arrived, and made no exception to their rule on the  present occasion, a suitable gloom was the keynote of the gathering.  Mr. Jackson seemed to bear the parting with fortitude, as did Mike's  Uncle John (providentially roped in at the eleventh hour on his way  to Scotland, in time to come down with a handsome tip). To their  coarse-fibred minds there was nothing pathetic or tragic about the  affair at all. (At the very moment when the train began to glide out  of the station Uncle John was heard to remark that, in his opinion,  these Bocks weren't a patch on the old shaped Larranaga.) Among others  present might have been noticed Saunders, practising late cuts rather  coyly with a walking-stick in the background; the village idiot, who  had rolled up on the chance of a dole; Gladys Maud Evangeline's nurse,  smiling vaguely; and Gladys Maud Evangeline herself, frankly bored  with the whole business.    The train gathered speed. The air was full of last messages. Uncle  John said on second thoughts he wasn't sure these Bocks weren't half a  bad smoke after all. Gladys Maud cried, because she had taken a sudden  dislike to the village idiot; and Mike settled himself in the corner  and opened a magazine.    He was alone in the carriage. Bob, who had been spending the last week  of the holidays with an aunt further down the line, was to board the  train at East Wobsley, and the brothers were to make a state entry  into Wrykyn together. Meanwhile, Mike was left to his milk chocolate,  his magazines, and his reflections.    The latter were not numerous, nor profound. He was excited. He had  been petitioning the home authorities for the past year to be allowed  to leave his private school and go to Wrykyn, and now the thing had  come about. He wondered what sort of a house Wain's was, and whether  they had any chance of the cricket cup. According to Bob they had no  earthly; but then Bob only recognised one house, Donaldson's. He  wondered if Bob would get his first eleven cap this year, and if he  himself were likely to do anything at cricket. Marjory had faithfully  reported every word Saunders had said on the subject, but Bob had been  so careful to point out his insignificance when compared with the  humblest Wrykynian that the professional's glowing prophecies had not  had much effect. It might be true that some day he would play for  England, but just at present he felt he would exchange his place in  the team for one in the Wrykyn third eleven. A sort of mist enveloped  everything Wrykynian. It seemed almost hopeless to try and compete  with these unknown experts. On the other hand, there was Bob. Bob, by  all accounts, was on the verge of the first eleven, and he was nothing  special.    While he was engaged on these reflections, the train drew up at a  small station. Opposite the door of Mike's compartment was standing a  boy of about Mike's size, though evidently some years older. He had a  sharp face, with rather a prominent nose; and a pair of pince-nez gave  him a supercilious look. He wore a bowler hat, and carried a small  portmanteau.    He opened the door, and took the seat opposite to Mike, whom he  scrutinised for a moment rather after the fashion of a naturalist  examining some new and unpleasant variety of beetle. He seemed about  to make some remark, but, instead, got up and looked through the open  window.    \"Where's that porter?\" Mike heard him say.    The porter came skimming down the platform at that moment.    \"Porter.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Are those frightful boxes of mine in all right?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Because, you know, there'll be a frightful row if any of them get  lost.\"    \"No chance of that, sir.\"    \"Here you are, then.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    The youth drew his head and shoulders in, stared at Mike again, and  finally sat down. Mike noticed that he had nothing to read, and  wondered if he wanted anything; but he did not feel equal to offering  him one of his magazines. He did not like the looks of him  particularly. Judging by appearances, he seemed to carry enough side  for three. If he wanted a magazine, thought Mike, let him ask for it.    The other made no overtures, and at the next stop got out. That  explained his magazineless condition. He was only travelling a short  way.    \"Good business,\" said Mike to himself. He had all the Englishman's  love of a carriage to himself.    The train was just moving out of the station when his eye was suddenly  caught by the stranger's bag, lying snugly in the rack.    And here, I regret to say, Mike acted from the best motives, which is  always fatal.    He realised in an instant what had happened. The fellow had forgotten  his bag.    Mike had not been greatly fascinated by the stranger's looks; but,  after all, the most supercilious person on earth has a right to his  own property. Besides, he might have been quite a nice fellow when you  got to know him. Anyhow, the bag had better be returned at once. The  trainwas already moving quite fast, and Mike's compartment was nearing  the end of the platform.    He snatched the bag from the rack and hurled it out of the window.  (Porter Robinson, who happened to be in the line of fire, escaped with  a flesh wound.) Then he sat down again with the inward glow of  satisfaction which comes to one when one has risen successfully to a  sudden emergency.           *       *       *       *       *    The glow lasted till the next stoppage, which did not occur for a good  many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#2)"],[1,"when she had eagerly drunk the last drop; and suddenly the dismal field  changed to a new world so full of wonders that all her troubles were  forgotten in a minute.    Bells were ringing so merrily that it was hard to keep from dancing.  Green garlands hung on the walls, and every tree was a Christmas tree  full of toys, and blazing with candles that never went out.    In one place many little spirits sewed like mad on warm clothes, turning  off work faster than any sewing-machine ever invented, and great piles  were made ready to be sent to poor people. Other busy creatures packed  money into purses, and wrote checks which they sent flying away on the  wind,--a lovely kind of snow-storm to fall into a world below full of  poverty.    Older and graver spirits were looking over piles of little books, in  which the records of the past year were kept, telling how different  people had spent it, and what sort of gifts they deserved. Some got  peace, some disappointment, some remorse and sorrow, some great joy and  hope. The rich had generous thoughts sent them; the poor, gratitude and  contentment. Children had more love and duty to parents; and parents  renewed patience, wisdom, and satisfaction for and in their children. No  one was forgotten.    \"Please tell me what splendid place this is?\" asked Effie, as soon as  she could collect her wits after the first look at all these astonishing  things.    \"This is the Christmas world; and here we work all the year round, never  tired of getting ready for the happy day. See, these are the saints  just setting off; for some have far to go, and the children must not be  disappointed.\"    As he spoke the spirit pointed to four gates, out of which four great  sleighs were just driving, laden with toys, while a jolly old Santa  Claus sat in the middle of each, drawing on his mittens and tucking up  his wraps for a long cold drive.    \"Why, I thought there was only one Santa Claus, and even he was a  humbug,\" cried Effie, astonished at the sight.    \"Never give up your faith in the sweet old stones, even after you come  to see that they are only the pleasant shadow of a lovely truth.\"    Just then the sleighs went off with a great jingling of bells and  pattering of reindeer hoofs, while all the spirits gave a cheer that was  heard in the lower world, where people said, \"Hear the stars sing.\"    \"I never will say there isn't any Santa Claus again. Now, show me more.\"    \"You will like to see this place, I think, and may learn something here  perhaps\"    The spirit smiled as he led the way to a little door, through which  Effie peeped into a world of dolls. Baby-houses were in full blast, with  dolls of all sorts going on like live people. Waxen ladies sat in their  parlors elegantly dressed; black dolls cooked in the kitchens; nurses  walked out with the bits of dollies; and the streets were full of tin  soldiers marching, wooden horses prancing, express wagons rumbling, and  little men hurrying to and fro. Shops were there, and tiny people buying  legs of mutton, pounds of tea, mites of clothes, and everything dolls  use or wear or want.    But presently she saw that in some ways the dolls improved upon the  manners and customs of human beings, and she watched eagerly to learn  why they did these things. A fine Paris doll driving in her carriage  took up a black worsted Dinah who was hobbling along with a basket of  clean clothes, and carried her to her journey's end, as if it were  the proper thing to do. Another interesting china lady took off her  comfortable red cloak and put it round a poor wooden creature done up in  a paper shift, and so badly painted that its face would have sent some  babies into fits.    \"Seems to me I once knew a rich girl who didn't give her things to poor  girls. I wish I could remember who she was, and tell her to be as kind  as that china doll,\" said Effie, much touched at the sweet way the  pretty creature wrapped up the poor fright, and then ran off in her  little gray gown to buy a shiny fowl stuck on a wooden platter for her  invalid mother's dinner.    \"We recall these things to people's minds by dreams. I think the girl  you speak of won't forget this one.\" And the spirit smiled, as if he  enjoyed some joke which she did not see.    A little bell rang as she looked, and away scampered the children into  the red-and-green school-house with the roof that lifted up, so one  could see how nicely they sat at their desks with mites of books, or  drew on the inch-square blackboards with crumbs of chalk.    \"They know their lessons very well, and are as still as mice. We make  a great racket at our school, and get bad marks every day. I shall tell  the girls they had better mind what they do, or their dolls will be  better scholars than they are,\" said Effie, much impressed, as she  peeped in and saw no rod in the hand of the little mistress, who looked  up and shook her head at the intruder, as if begging her to go away  before the order of the school was disturbed.    Effie retired at once, but could not resist one look in at the window of  a fine mansion, where the family were at dinner, the children behaved so  well at table, and never grumbled a bit when their mamma said they could  not have any more fruit.    \"Now, show me something else,\" she said, as they came again to the low  door that led out of Doll-land.    \"You have seen how we prepare for Christmas; let me show you where we  love best to send our good and happy gifts,\" answered the spirit, giving  her his hand again.    \"I know. I've seen ever so many,\" began Effie, thinking of her own  Christmases.    \"No, you have never seen what I will show you. Come away, and remember  what you see to-night.\"    Like a flash that bright world vanished, and Effie found herself in a  part of the city she had never seen before. It was far away from the  gayer places, where every store was brilliant with lights and full of  pretty things, and every house wore a festival air, while people hurried  to and fro with merry greetings. It was down among the dingy streets  where the poor lived, and where there was no making ready for Christmas.    Hungry women looked in at the shabby shops, longing to buy meat and  bread, but empty pockets forbade. Tipsy men drank up their wages in the  bar-rooms; and in many cold dark chambers little children huddled under  the thin blankets, trying to forget their misery in sleep.    No nice dinners filled the air with savory smells, no gay trees dropped  toys and bonbons into eager hands, no little stockings hung in rows  beside the chimney-piece ready to be filled, no happy sounds of music,  gay voices, and dancing feet were heard; and there were no signs of  Christmas anywhere.    \"Don't they have any in this place?\" asked Effie, shivering, as she held  fast the spirit's hand, following where he led her.    \"We come to bring it. Let me show you our best workers.\" And the spirit  pointed to some sweet-faced men and women who came stealing into the  poor houses, working such beautiful miracles that Effie could only stand  and watch.    Some slipped money into the empty pockets, and sent the happy mothers  to buy all the comforts they needed; others led the drunken men out of  temptation, and took them home to find safer pleasures there. Fires were  kindled on cold hearths, tables spread as if by magic, and warm clothes  wrapped round shivering limbs. Flowers suddenly bloomed in the chambers  of the sick; old people found themselves remembered; sad hearts were  consoled by a tender word, and wicked ones softened by the story of Him  who forgave all sin.    But the sweetest work was for the children; and Effie held her breath to  watch these human fairies hang up and fill the little stockings without  which a child's Christmas is not perfect, putting in things that once  she would have thought very humble presents, but which now seemed  beautiful and precious because these poor babies had nothing.    \"That is so beautiful! I wish I could make merry Christmases as these  good people do, and be loved and thanked as they are,\" said Effie,  softly, as she watched the busy men and women do their work and steal  away without thinking of any reward but their own satisfaction.    \"You can if you will. I have shown you the way. Try it, and see how  happy your own holiday will be hereafter.\"    As he spoke, the spirit seemed to put his arms about her, and vanished  with a kiss.    \"Oh, stay and show me more!\" cried Effie, trying to hold him fast.    \"Darling, wake up, and tell me why you are smiling in your sleep,\" said  a voice in her ear; and opening her eyes, there was mamma bending over  her, and morning sunshine streaming into the room.    \"Are they all gone? Did you hear the bells? Wasn't it splendid?\" she  asked, rubbing her eyes, and looking about her for the pretty child who  was so real and sweet.    \"You have been dreaming at a great rate,--talking in your sleep,  laughing, and clapping your hands as if you were cheering some one. Tell  me what was so splendid,\" said mamma, smoothing the tumbled hair and  lifting up the sleepy head.    Then, while she was being dressed, Effie told her dream, and Nursey  thought it very wonderful; but mamma smiled to see how curiously things  the child had thought, read, heard, and seen through the day were mixed  up in her sleep.    \"The spirit said I could work lovely miracles if I tried; but I don't  know how to begin, for I have no magic candle to make feasts appear, and  light up groves of Christmas trees, as he did,\" said Effie, sorrowfully.    \"Yes, you have. We will do it! we will do it!\" And clapping her hands,  mamma suddenly began to dance all over the room as if she had lost her  wits.    \"How? how? You must tell me, mamma,\" cried Effie, dancing after her, and  ready to believe anything possible when she remembered the adventures of  the past night.    \"I've got it! I've got it!--the new idea. A splendid one, if I can"]]]
