Milton, returning to Cambridge after his summer vacation,  eager for the acquisition of wisdom, complains that he \"was dragged  from his studies, and compelled to employ himself in composing  some frivolous declamation!\" Indocile, as he confesses himself  (indocilisque aetas prava magistra fuit), he kicked against either the  discipline or the exercises exacted by college rules. He was punished.  Aubrey had heard that he was flogged, a thing not impossible in  itself, as the _Admonition Book_ of Emanuel gives an instance of  corporal chastisement as late as 1667. Aubrey's statement, however, is  a dubitative interlineation in his MS., and Milton's age, seventeen,  as well as the silence of his later detractors, who raked up  everything which could be told to his disadvantage, concur to make us  hesitate to accept a fact on so slender evidence. Anyhow, Milton was  sent away from college for a time, in the year 1627, in consequence  of something unpleasant which had occurred. That it was something of  which he was not ashamed is clear, from his alluding to it himself in  the lines written at the time,--        Nec duri libet usque minas perferre magistri        Caeteraque ingenio non subeunda meo.    And that the tutor was not considered to have been wholly free from  blame is evident from the fact that the master transferred Milton from  Chappell to another tutor, a very unusual proceeding. Whatever the  nature of the punishment, it was not what is known as rustication; for  Milton did not lose a term, taking his two degrees of B.A. and M.A. in  regular course, at the earliest date from his matriculation permitted  by the statutes. The one outbreak of juvenile petulance and  indiscipline over, Milton's force of character and unusual attainments  acquired him the esteem of his seniors. The nickname of \"the lady  of Christ's\" given him in derision by his fellow-students, is an  attestation of virtuous conduct. Ten years later, in 1642, Milton  takes an opportunity to \"acknowledge publicly, with all grateful  mind, that more than ordinary respect which I found, above many of my  equals, at the hands of those courteous and learned men, the Fellows  of that college wherein I spent some years; who, at my parting after I  had taken two degrees, as the manner is, signified many ways how much  better it would content them that I would stay; as by many letters  full of kindness and loving respect, both before that time and long  after, I was assured of their singular good affection towards me.\"    The words \"how much better it would content them that I would stay\"  have been thought to hint at the offer of a fellowship at Christ's. It  is highly improvable that such an offer was ever made. There had been  two vacancies in the roll of fellows since Milton had become eligible  by taking his B.A. degree, and he had been passed over in favour of  juniors. It is possible that Milton was not statutably eligible, for,  by the statutes of Christ's, there could not be, at one time, more  than two fellows who were natives of the same county. Edward King, who  was Milton's junior, was put in, not by college election, but by  royal mandate. And in universities generally, it is not literature or  general acquirements which recommend a candidate for endowed posts,  but technical skill in the prescribed exercises, and a pedagogic  intention.    Further than this, had a fellowship in his college been attainable, it  would not have had much attraction for Milton. A fellowship implied  two things, residence in college, with teaching, and orders in the  church. With neither of these two conditions was Milton prepared to  comply. In 1632, when he proceeded to his M.A. degree, Milton was  twenty-four, he had been seven years in college, and had therefore  sufficient experience what college life was like. He who was so  impatient of the \"turba legentum prava\" in the Bodleian library, could  not have patiently consorted with the vulgar-minded and illiterate  ecclesiastics, who peopled the colleges of that day. Even Mede, though  the author of _Clavis Apocalyptica_ was steeped in the soulless  clericalism of his age, could not support his brother-fellows without  frequent retirements to Balsham, \"being not willing to be joined  with such company.\" To be dependent upon Bainbrigge's (the Master of  Christ's) good pleasure for a supply of pupils; to have to live in  daily intercourse with the Powers and the Chappells, such as we know  them from Mede's letters, was an existence to which only the want  of daily bread could have driven Milton. Happily his father's  circumstances were not such as to make a fellowship pecuniarily an  object to the son. If he longed for \"the studious cloister's pale,\"  he had been, now for seven years, near enough to college life to  have dispelled the dream that it was a life of lettered leisure and  philosophic retirement. It was just about Milton's time that the  college tutor finally supplanted the university professor, a system  which implied the substitution of excercises performed by the pupil  for instruction given by the teacher. Whatever advantages this system  brought with it, it brought inevitably the degradation of the teacher,  who was thus dispensed from knowledge, having only to attend to  form. The time of the college tutor was engrossed by the details of  scholastic superintendence, and the frivolous worry of academical  business. Admissions, matriculations, disputations, declamations, the  formalities of degrees, public reception of royal and noble visitors,  filled every hour of his day, and left no time, even if he had had the  taste, for private study. To teaching, as we shall see, Milton was  far from averse. But then it must be teaching as he understood it, a  teaching which should expand the intellect and raise the character,  not dexterity in playing with the verbal formulae of the disputations  of the schools.    Such an occupation could have no attractions for one who was even now  meditating _Il Penseroso_ (composed 1633). At twenty he had already  confided to his schoolfellow, the younger Gill, the secret of his  discontent with the Cambridge tone. \"Here among us,\" he writes from  college, \"are barely one or two who do not flutter off, all unfledged,  into theology, having gotten of philology or of philosophy scarce so  much as a smattering. And for theology they are content with just what  is enough to enable them to patch up a paltry sermon.\" He retained the  same feeling towards his Alma Mater in 1641, when he wrote (Reason of  Church Government), \"Cambridge, which as in the time of her better  health, and mine own younger judgment, I never greatly admired, so now  much less....\"    On a review of all these indications of feeling, I should conclude  that Milton never had serious thoughts of a college fellowship, and  that his antipathy arose from a sense of his own incompatibility of  temper with academic life, and was not, like Phineas Fletcher's, the  result of disappointed hopes, and a sense of injury for having been  refused a fellowship at King's. One consideration which remains to be  mentioned would alone be decisive in favour of this view. A fellowship  required orders. Milton had been intended for the church, and had been  sent to college with that view. By the time he left Cambridge, at  twenty-four, it had become clear, both to himself and his family, that  he could never submit his understanding to the trammels of church  formularies. His later mind, about 1641, is expressed by himself  in his own forcible style,--\"The church, to whose service by the  intention of my parents and friends I was destined of a child, and  in mine own resolutions, till coming to some maturity of years, and  perceiving what tyranny had invaded in the church, that he who would  take orders must subscribe slave, and take an oath withal.... I  thought it better to prefer a blameless silence before the sacred  office of speaking, bought and begun with servitude and forswearing.\"  When he took leave of the university, in 1632, he had perhaps not  developed this distinct antipathy to the establishment. For in a  letter, preserved in Trinity College, and written in the winter of  1631-32, he does not put forward any conscientious objections to the  clerical profession, but only apologises to the friend to whom the  letter is addressed, for delay in making choice of some profession.  The delay itself sprung from an unconscious distaste. In a mind of  the consistent texture of Milton's, motives are secretly influential  before they emerge in consciousness. We shall not be wrong in  asserting that when he left Cambridge in 1632, it was already  impossible, in the nature of things, that he should have taken orders  in the Church of England, or a fellowship of which orders were a  condition.          CHAPTER II.    RESIDENCE AT HORTON--L'ALLEGRO--IL PENSEROSO--ARCADES--COMUS--LYCIDAS.      Milton had been sent to college to quality for a profession. The  church, the first intended, he had gradually discovered to be  incompatible. Of the law, either his father's branch, or some other,  he seems to have entertained a thought, but to have speedily dismissed  it. So at the age of twenty-four he returned to his father's house,  bringing nothing with him but his education and a silent purpose. The  elder Milton had now retired from business, with sufficient means but  not with wealth. Though John was the eldest son, there were two other  children, a brother, Christopher, and a sister, Anne. To have no  profession, even a nominal one, to be above trade and below the status  of squire or yeoman, and to come home with the avowed object of  leading an idle life, was conduct which required justification. Milton  felt it to be so. In a letter addressed, in 1632, to some senior  friend at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#2)"],[1,"decline to reveal to anybody.\"    \"Well, that sounds logical,\" says Jurgen, \"but still, at the same  time, it would be no worse for an admixture of common-sense. For you  gentlemen can see for yourselves, by considering these pages fairly  and as a whole, that these pages bear a sword and a lance and a  staff, and nothing else whatever; and you will deduce, I hope, that  all the lewdness is in the insectival mind of him who itches to be  calling these things by other names.\"    The judges said nothing as yet. But they that guarded Jurgen, and  all the other Philistines, stood to this side and to that side with  their eyes shut tight, and all these said: \"We decline to look at  the pages fairly and as a whole, because to look might seem to imply  a doubt of what the tumblebug has decreed. Besides, as long as the  tumblebug has reasons which he declines to reveal, his reasons stay  unanswerable, and you are plainly a prurient rascal who are making  trouble for yourself.\"    \"To the contrary,\" says Jurgen, \"I am a poet, and I make  literature.\"    \"But in Philistia to make literature and to make trouble for  yourself are synonyms,\" the tumblebug explained. \"I know, for  already we of Philistia have been pestered by three of these makers  of literature. Yes, there was Edgar, whom I starved and hunted until  I was tired of it: then I chased him up a back alley one night, and  knocked out those annoying brains of his. And there was Walt, whom I  chivvied and battered from place to place, and made a paralytic of  him: and him, too, I labelled offensive and lewd and lascivious and  indecent. Then later there was Mark, whom I frightened into  disguising himself in a clown's suit, so that nobody might suspect  him to be a maker of literature: indeed, I frightened him so that he  hid away the greater part of what he had made until after he was  dead, and I could not get at him. That was a disgusting trick to  play on me, I consider. Still, these are the only three detected  makers of literature that have ever infested Philistia, thanks be to  goodness and my vigilance, but for both of which we might have been  no more free from makers of literature than are the other  countries.\"    \"Now, but these three,\" cried Jurgen, \"are the glory of Philistia:  and of all that Philistia has produced, it is these three alone,  whom living ye made least of, that to-day are honored wherever art  is honored, and where nobody bothers one way or the other about  Philistia.\"    \"What is art to me and my way of living?\" replied the tumblebug,  wearily. \"I have no concern with art and letters and the other lewd  idols of foreign nations. I have in charge the moral welfare of my  young, whom I roll here before me, and trust with St. Anthony's aid  to raise in time to be God-fearing tumblebugs like me, delighting in  what is proper to their nature. For the rest, I have never minded  dead men being well-spoken-of. No, no, my lad: once whatever I may  do means nothing to you, and once you are really rotten, you will  find the tumblebug friendly enough. Meanwhile I am paid to protest  that living persons are offensive and lewd and lascivious and  indecent, and one must live.\"    Then the Philistines who stood to this side and to that side said in  indignant unison: \"And we, the reputable citizenry of Philistia, are  not at all in sympathy with those who would take any protest against  the tumblebug as a justification of what they are pleased to call  art. The harm done by the tumblebug seems to us very slight, whereas  the harm done by the self-styled artist may be very great.\"    Jurgen now looked more attentively at this queer creature: and he  saw that the tumblebug was malodorous, certainly, but at bottom  honest and well-meaning; and this seemed to Jurgen the saddest thing  he had found among the Philistines. For the tumblebug was sincere in  his insane doings, and all Philistia honored him sincerely, so that  there was nowhere any hope for this people.    Therefore King Jurgen addressed himself, as his need was, to submit  to the strange customs of the Philistines. \"Now do you judge me  fairly,\" cried Jurgen to his judges, \"if there be any justice in  this mad country. And if there be none, do you relegate me to limbo  or to any other place, so long as in that place this tumblebug is  not omnipotent and sincere and insane.\"    And Jurgen waited....          *       *       *       *       *         JURGEN     ... _amara lento temperet risu_          1.    Why Jurgen Did the Manly Thing      It is a tale which they narrate in Poictesme, saying: In the 'old  days lived a pawnbroker named Jurgen; but what his wife called him  was very often much worse than that. She was a high-spirited woman,  with no especial gift for silence. Her name, they say, was Adelais,  but people by ordinary called her Dame Lisa.    They tell, also, that in the old days, after putting up the shop-windows  for the night, Jurgen was passing the Cistercian Abbey, on his way home:  and one of the monks had tripped over a stone in the roadway. He was  cursing the devil who had placed it there.    \"Fie, brother!\" says Jurgen, \"and have not the devils enough to bear  as it is?\"    \"I never held with Origen,\" replied the monk; \"and besides, it hurt  my great-toe confoundedly.\"    \"None the less,\" observes Jurgen, \"it does not behoove God-fearing  persons to speak with disrespect of the divinely appointed Prince of  Darkness. To your further confusion, consider this monarch's  industry! day and night you may detect him toiling at the task  Heaven set him. That is a thing can be said of few communicants and  of no monks. Think, too, of his fine artistry, as evidenced in all  the perilous and lovely snares of this world, which it is your  business to combat, and mine to lend money upon. Why, but for him we  would both be vocationless! Then, too, consider his philanthropy!  and deliberate how insufferable would be our case if you and I, and  all our fellow parishioners, were to-day hobnobbing with other  beasts in the Garden which we pretend to desiderate on Sundays! To  arise with swine and lie down with the hyena?--oh, intolerable!\"    Thus he ran on, devising reasons for not thinking too harshly of the  Devil. Most of it was an abridgement of some verses Jurgen had  composed, in the shop when business was slack.    \"I consider that to be stuff and nonsense,\" was the monk's glose.    \"No doubt your notion is sensible,\" observed the pawnbroker: \"but  mine is the prettier.\"    Then Jurgen passed the Cistercian Abbey, and was approaching  Bellegarde, when he met a black gentleman, who saluted him and said:    \"Thanks, Jurgen, for your good word.\"    \"Who are you, and why do you thank me?\" asks Jurgen.    \"My name is no great matter. But you have a kind heart, Jurgen. May  your life be free from care!\"    \"Save us from hurt and harm, friend, but I am already married.\"    \"Eh, sirs, and a fine clever poet like you!\"    \"Yet it is a long while now since I was a practising poet.\"    \"Why, to be sure! You have the artistic temperament, which is not  exactly suited to the restrictions of domestic life. Then I suppose  your wife has her own personal opinion about poetry, Jurgen.\"    \"Indeed, sir, her opinion would not bear repetition, for I am sure  you are unaccustomed to such language.\"    \"This is very sad. I am afraid your wife does not quite understand  you, Jurgen.\"    \"Sir,\" says Jurgen, astounded, \"do you read people's inmost  thoughts?\"    The black gentleman seemed much dejected. He pursed his lips, and  fell to counting upon his fingers: as they moved his sharp nails  glittered like flame-points.    \"Now but this is a very deplorable thing,\" says the black gentleman,  \"to have befallen the first person I have found ready to speak a  kind word for evil. And in all these centuries, too! Dear me, this  is a most regrettable instance of mismanagement! No matter, Jurgen,  the morning is brighter than the evening. How I will reward you, to  be sure!\"    So Jurgen thanked the simple old creature politely. And when Jurgen  reached home his wife was nowhere to be seen. He looked on all sides  and questioned everyone, but to no avail. Dame Lisa had vanished in  the midst of getting supper ready--suddenly, completely and  inexplicably, just as (in Jurgen's figure) a windstorm passes and  leaves behind it a tranquillity which seems, by contrast, uncanny.  Nothing could explain the mystery, short of magic: and Jurgen on a  sudden recollected the black gentleman's queer promise. Jurgen  crossed himself.    \"How unjustly now,\" says Jurgen, \"do some people get an ill name for  gratitude! And now do I perceive how wise I am, always to speak  pleasantly of everybody, in this world of tale-bearers.\"    Then Jurgen prepared his own supper, went to bed, and slept soundly.    \"I have implicit confidence,\" says he, \"in Lisa. I have particular  confidence in her ability to take care of herself in any  surroundings.\"    That was all very well: but time passed, and presently it began to  be rumored that Dame Lisa walked on Morven. Her brother, who was a  grocer and a member of the town-council, went thither to see about  this report. And sure enough, there was Jurgen's wife walking in the  twilight and muttering incessantly.    \"Fie, sister!\" says the town-councillor, \"this is very unseemly  conduct for a married woman, and a thing likely to be talked about.\"    \"Follow me!\" replied Dame Lisa. And the town-councillor followed her  a little way in the dusk, but when she came to Amneran Heath and  still went onward, he knew better than to follow.    Next evening the elder sister of Dame Lisa went to Morven. This  sister had married a notary, and was a shrewd woman. In consequence,  she took with her this evening a long wand of peeled willow-wood.  And there was Jurgen's wife walking in the twilight and muttering  incessantly.    \"Fie, sister!\" says the notary's wife, who was a shrewd woman, \"and  "]]]
