[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#2)"],[1,". One of the oldest was the art    of writing. The way to write words or sounds was found out so long ago    that we shall never know the name of the man who first discovered it.    The historians tell us he lived in Egypt, which was in northern    Africa, exactly where Egypt is now. Some men were afraid that the new    art might do more harm than good. The king to whom the secret was told    thought that the children would be unwilling to work hard and try to    remember because everything could be written down and they would not    need to use their memories. The Egyptians at first used pictures to    put their words upon rocks or paper, and even after they made several    letters of the alphabet their writing seemed like a mixture of little    pictures and queer marks.      [Illustration: Cleopatra EGYPTIAN PHONETIC WRITING]    OLD AND NEW INVENTIONS. Those who first discover how to make things    are called inventors, and what they make are called inventions. Now if    we should write out a list of the most useful inventions, we could    place in one column the inventions which were made before the days of    Columbus and in another those which have been made since. With this    list before us we may ask which inventions we could live without and    which we could not spare unless we were willing to become like the    savages. We should find that a large number of the inventions which we    use every day belong to the set of things older than Columbus. This is    another reason why, if we wish to understand our ways of living and    working, we must ask about the history of the countries where our    forefathers lived. It is the beginning of our own history.      [Illustration: Phoenician Early Greek Early Latin English    GROWTH OF LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET]    A PLAN OF STUDY. The discovery of America was made in 1492, at the    beginning of what we call Modern Times. Before Modern Times were the    Middle Ages, lasting about a thousand years. These began three or four    hundred years after the time of Christ or what we call the beginning    of the Christian Era. All the events that took place earlier we say    happened in Ancient Times. Much that we know was learned first by the    Greeks or Romans who lived in Ancient Times.      It is in the Middle Ages that we first hear of peoples called    Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Dutchmen, Italians, Spaniards, and    many others now living in Great Britain and on the Continent of    Europe. We shall learn first of the Greeks and Romans and of what they    knew and succeeded in doing, and then shall find out how these things    were learned by the peoples of the Middle Ages and what they added to    them. This will help us to find out what our forefathers started with    when they came to live in America.          QUESTIONS        1. What does the emigrant from Europe bring to America besides his      baggage?        2. Why are all Americans emigrants?        3. What did the earliest emigrants from Europe to America bring with      them?        4. Which do you think the more useful invention--the telephone or      the art of writing? Who invented this art? Find Egypt on the map.      How did Egyptian writing look?        5. Why was it a help to Columbus that gunpowder and guns were      invented before he discovered America?        6. When did the Christian Era begin? What is meant by Ancient Times?      By the Middle Ages? By Modern Times? In what Times was the art of      writing invented? In what Times was the compass invented? In what      Times was the telephone invented?        EXERCISES        1. Collect from illustrated papers, magazines, or advertising      folders, pictures of ocean steamships. Collect pictures of sailing      ships, ships used now and those used long ago.        2. Collect from persons who have recently come to this country      stories of how they traveled from Europe to America, and from ports      like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to where they now live.        3. Let each boy and girl in the schoolroom point out on the map the      European country from which his parents or his grandparents or his      forefathers came.        4. Let each boy and girl make a list of the holidays which his      forefathers had in the \"fatherland\" or \"mother country.\" Let each      find out the manner in which the holidays were kept. Let each tell      the most interesting hero story from among the stories of the mother      country or fatherland. Let each find out whether the tools used in      the old home were like the tools his parents use here.          CHAPTER II      OUR EARLIEST TEACHERS    ANCIENT CITIES THAT STILL EXIST. In Ancient Times the most    important peoples lived on the shores of the Mediterranean. The    northern shore turns and twists around four peninsulas. The first is    Spain, which separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean;    the second, shaped like a boot, is Italy; and the third, the end of    which looks like a mulberry leaf, is Greece. Beyond Greece is Asia    Minor, the part of Asia which lies between the Mediterranean Sea and    the Black Sea.      The Italians now live in Italy, but the Romans lived there in Ancient    Times. The people who live in Greece are called Greeks, just as they    were more than two thousand years ago. Many of the cities that the    Greeks and Romans built are still standing. Alexandria was founded by    the great conqueror Alexander. Constantinople used to be the Greek    city of Byzantium. Another Greek city, Massilia, has become the modern    French city of Marseilles. Rome had the same name in Ancient Times,    except that it was spelled Roma. The Romans called Paris by the name    of Lutetia, and London they called Lugdunum.    RUINS WHICH SHOW HOW THE ANCIENTS LIVED. In many of these cities    are ancient buildings or ruins of buildings, bits of carving, vases,    mosaics, sometimes even wall paintings, which we may see and from    which we may learn how the Greeks and Romans lived. Near Naples are    the ruins of Pompeii, a Roman city suddenly destroyed during an    eruption of the volcano Vesuvius.      For hundreds of years the city lay buried under fifteen or twenty feet    of ashes. When these were taken away, the old streets and the walls of    the houses could be seen. No roofs were left and the walls in many    places were only partly standing, but things which in other ancient    cities had entirely disappeared were kept safe in Pompeii under the    volcanic ashes.      The traveler who walks to-day along the ruined streets can see how its    inhabitants lived two thousand years ago. He can visit their public    buildings and their private houses, can handle their dishes and can    look at the paintings on their walls or the mosaics in the floors. But    interesting as Pompeii is, we must not think that its ruins teach us    more than the ruins of Rome or Athens or many other ancient cities.    Each has something important to tell us of the people who lived long    ago.    ANCIENT WORDS STILL IN USE. The ancient Greeks and Romans have left    us some things more useful than the ruins of their buildings. These    are the words in our language which once were theirs, and which we use    with slight changes in spelling. Most of our words came in the    beginning from Germany, where our English forefathers lived before    they settled in England. To the words they took over from Germany they    added words borrowed from other peoples, just as we do now. We have    recently borrowed several words from the French, such as tonneau and    limousine, words used to describe parts of an automobile, besides the    name automobile itself, which is made up of a Latin and a Greek word.      [Illustration: RUINS OF A HOUSE AT POMPEII The houses of the    better sort were built with an open court in the center]      In this way, for hundreds of years, words have been coming into our    language from other languages. Several thousand have come from Latin,    the language of the Romans; several hundred from Greek, either    directly or passed on to us by the Romans or the French. The word    school is Greek, and the word arithmetic was borrowed from the French,    who took it from the Greeks. Geography is another word which came,    through French and Latin, from the Greeks, to whom it meant that which    is written about the earth. The word grammar came in the same way. The    word alphabet is made by joining together the names of the first two    Greek letters, alpha and beta.      Many words about religion are borrowed from the Greeks, and this is    not strange, for the New Testament was written in Greek. Some of these    are Bible, church, bishop, choir, angel, devil, apostle, and martyr.    The Greeks have handed down to us many words about government,    including the word itself, which in the beginning meant \"to steer.\"    Politics meant having to do with a _polis_ or city. Several of the    words most recently made up of Greek words are telegraph, telephone,    phonograph, and thermometer.    MANY WORDS BORROWED FROM THE ROMANS. Nearly ten times as many of    our words are borrowed from the Romans as from the Greeks, and it is    not strange, because at one time the Romans ruled over all the country    now occupied by the Italians, the French, the Spaniards, a part of the    Germans, and the English, so that these peoples naturally learned the    words used by their conquerors and governors.    INTERESTING ANCIENT STORIES. In the poems and tales which we learn    at home or at school are stories which Greek and Roman parents and    teachers taught their children many hundred years ago. We learn them    partly because they are interesting, and because they please or amuse    us, and partly because they appear so often in our books that it is    necessary to know them if we would understand our own books and    language.

But this was not  my only hair-breadth escape.  A German blacksmith whom I knew well was on  the train with me, and looked at me very intently, as if he thought he  had seen me somewhere before in his travels.  I really believe he knew  me, but had no heart to betray me.  At any rate, he saw me escaping and  held his peace.    The last point of imminent danger, and the one I dreaded most, was  Wilmington.  Here we left the train and took the steam-boat for  Philadelphia.  In making the change here I again apprehended arrest, but  no one disturbed me, and I was soon on the broad and beautiful Delaware,  speeding away to the Quaker City.  On reaching Philadelphia in the  afternoon, I inquired of a colored man how I could get on to New York.  He directed me to the William-street depot, and thither I went, taking  the train that night.  I reached New York Tuesday morning, having  completed the journey in less than twenty-four hours.    My free life began on the third of September, 1838.  On the morning of  the fourth of that month, after an anxious and most perilous but safe  journey, I found myself in the big city of New York, a FREE MAN--one more  added to the mighty throng which, like the confused waves of the troubled  sea, surged to and fro between the lofty walls of Broadway.  Though  dazzled with the wonders which met me on every hand, my thoughts could  not be much withdrawn from my strange situation.  For the moment, the  dreams of my youth and the hopes of my manhood were completely fulfilled.  The bonds that had held me to \"old master\" were broken.  No man now had a  right to call me his slave or assert mastery over me.  I was in the rough  and tumble of an outdoor world, to take my chance with the rest of its  busy number.  I have often been asked how I felt when first I found  myself on free soil.  There is scarcely anything in my experience about  which I could not give a more satisfactory answer.  A new world had  opened upon me.  If life is more than breath and the \"quick round of  blood,\" I lived more in that one day than in a year of my slave life.  It  was a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely describe.  In  a letter written to a friend soon after reaching New York, I said: \"I  felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions.\"  Anguish  and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness and joy,  like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.  During ten or fifteen  years I had been, as it were, dragging a heavy chain which no strength of  mine could break; I was not only a slave, but a slave for life.  I might  become a husband, a father, an aged man, but through all, from birth to  death, from the cradle to the grave, I had felt myself doomed.  All  efforts I had previously made to secure my freedom had not only failed,  but had seemed only to rivet my fetters the more firmly, and to render my  escape more difficult.  Baffled, entangled, and discouraged, I had at  times asked myself the question, May not my condition after all be God's  work, and ordered for a wise purpose, and if so, Is not submission my  duty?  A contest had in fact been going on in my mind for a long time,  between the clear consciousness of right and the plausible make-shifts of  theology and superstition.  The one held me an abject slave--a prisoner  for life, punished for some transgression in which I had no lot nor part;  and the other counseled me to manly endeavor to secure my freedom.  This  contest was now ended; my chains were broken, and the victory brought me  unspeakable joy.    But my gladness was short-lived, for I was not yet out of the reach and  power of the slave-holders.  I soon found that New York was not quite so  free or so safe a refuge as I had supposed, and a sense of loneliness and  insecurity again oppressed me most sadly. I chanced to meet on the  street, a few hours after my landing, a fugitive slave whom I had once  known well in slavery.  The information received from him alarmed me.  The fugitive in question was known in Baltimore as \"Allender's Jake,\" but  in New York he wore the more respectable name of \"William Dixon.\"  Jake,  in law, was the property of Doctor Allender, and Tolly Allender, the son  of the doctor, had once made an effort to recapture MR. DIXON, but had  failed for want of evidence to support his claim.  Jake told me the  circumstances of this attempt, and how narrowly he escaped being sent  back to slavery and torture.  He told me that New York was then full of  Southerners returning from the Northern watering-places; that the colored  people of New York were not to be trusted; that there were hired men of  my own color who would betray me for a few dollars; that there were hired  men ever on the lookout for fugitives; that I must trust no man with my  secret; that I must not think of going either upon the wharves or into  any colored boarding-house, for all such places were closely watched;  that he was himself unable to help me; and, in fact, he seemed while  speaking to me to fear lest I myself might be a spy and a betrayer.  Under this apprehension, as I suppose, he showed signs of wishing to be  rid of me, and with whitewash brush in hand, in search of work, he soon  disappeared.    This picture, given by poor \"Jake,\" of New York, was a damper to my  enthusiasm.  My little store of money would soon be exhausted, and since  it would be unsafe for me to go on the wharves for work, and I had no  introductions elsewhere, the prospect for me was far from cheerful.  I  saw the wisdom of keeping away from the ship-yards, for, if pursued, as I  felt certain I should be, Mr. Auld, my \"master,\" would naturally seek me  there among the calkers.  Every door seemed closed against me.  I was in  the midst of an ocean of my fellow-men, and yet a perfect stranger to  every one.  I was without home, without acquaintance, without money,  without credit, without work, and without any definite knowledge as to  what course to take, or where to look for succor.  In such an extremity,  a man had something besides his new-born freedom to think of.  While  wandering about the streets of New York, and lodging at least one night  among the barrels on one of the wharves, I was indeed free--from slavery,  but free from food and shelter as well.  I kept my secret to myself as  long as I could, but I was compelled at last to seek some one who would  befriend me without taking advantage of my destitution to betray me.  Such a person I found in a sailor named Stuart, a warm-hearted and  generous fellow, who, from his humble home on Centre street, saw me  standing on the opposite sidewalk, near the Tombs prison.  As he  approached me, I ventured a remark to him which at once enlisted his  interest in me.  He took me to his home to spend the night, and in the  morning went with me to Mr. David Ruggles, the secretary of the New York  Vigilance Committee, a co-worker with Isaac T. Hopper, Lewis and Arthur  Tappan, Theodore S. Wright, Samuel Cornish, Thomas Downing, Philip A.  Bell, and other true men of their time.  All these (save Mr. Bell, who  still lives, and is editor and publisher of a paper called the  \"Elevator,\" in San Francisco) have finished their work on earth.  Once in  the hands of these brave and wise men, I felt comparatively safe.  With  Mr. Ruggles, on the corner of Lispenard and Church streets, I was hidden  several days, during which time my intended wife came on from Baltimore  at my call, to share the burdens of life with me.  She was a free woman,  and came at once on getting the good news of my safety.  We were married  by Rev. J. W. C.  Pennington, then a well-known and respected  Presbyterian minister.  I had no money with which to pay the marriage  fee, but he seemed well pleased with our thanks.    Mr. Ruggles was the first officer on the \"Underground Railroad\" whom I  met after coming North, and was, indeed, the only one with whom I had  anything to do till I became such an officer myself.  Learning that my  trade was that of a calker, he promptly decided that the best place for  me was in New Bedford, Mass.  He told me that many ships for whaling  voyages were fitted out there, and that I might there find work at my  trade and make a good living.  So, on the day of the marriage ceremony,  we took our little luggage to the steamer John W. Richmond, which, at  that time, was one of the line running between New York and Newport, R.  I.  Forty-three years ago colored travelers were not permitted in the  cabin, nor allowed abaft the paddle-wheels of a steam vessel.  They were  compelled, whatever the weather might be,--whether cold or hot, wet or  dry,--to spend the night on deck.  Unjust as this regulation was, it did  not trouble us much; we had fared much harder before.  We arrived at  Newport the next morning, and soon after an old fashioned stage-coach,  with \"New Bedford\" in large yellow letters on its sides, came down to the  wharf.  I had not money enough to pay our fare, and stood hesitating what  to do.  Fortunately for us, there were two Quaker gentlemen who were  about to take passage on the stage,--Friends William C. Taber and Joseph  Ricketson,--who at once discerned our true situation, and, in a  peculiarly quiet way, addressing me, Mr. Taber said: \"Thee get in.\" I  never obeyed an order with more alacrity, and we were soon on our way to  our new home.  When we reached \"Stone Bridge\" the passengers alighted for  breakfast, and paid their fares to the driver.  We took no breakfast,  and, when asked for our fares, I told the driver I would make it right  with him when we reached New Bedford.  I expected some objection to this  on his part, but he made none.  When, however, we reached New Bedford, he  took our baggage, including three music-books,--two of them collections  by Dyer, and one by Shaw,--and held them "]]]
