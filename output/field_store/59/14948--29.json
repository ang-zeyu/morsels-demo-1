Parliamentary Law.    Parliamentary Law refers originally to the customs and rules of  conducting business in the English Parliament; and thence to the customs  and rules of our own legislative assemblies.  In England these customs  and usages of Parliament form a part of the unwritten law of the land,  and in our own legislative bodies they are of authority in all cases  where they do not conflict with existing rules or precedents.    But as a people we have not the respect which the English have for  customs and precedents, and are always ready for innovations which we  think are improvements, and hence changes have been and are being  constantly made in the written rules which our legislative bodies have  found best to adopt.  As each house adopts its own rules, it results  that the two houses of the same legislature do not always agree in their  practice; even in Congress the order of precedence of motions is not  the same in both houses, and the Previous Question is admitted in the  House of Representatives, but not in the Senate.  As a consequence of  this, the exact method of conducting business in any particular    === Page 10 ============================================================    legislative body is to be obtained only from the Legislative Manual of  that body.    The vast number of societies, political, literary, scientific,  benevolent and religious, formed all over the land, though not  legislative, are still deliberative in their character, and must have  some system of conducting business, and some rules to govern their  proceedings, and are necessarily subject to the common parliamentary law  where it does not conflict with their own special rules.  But as their  knowledge of parliamentary law has been obtained from the usages in this  country, rather than from the customs of Parliament, it has resulted  that these societies have followed the customs of our own legislative  bodies, and our people have thus been educated under a system of  parliamentary law which is peculiar to this country, and yet so well  established as to supersede the English parliamentary law as the common  law of ordinary deliberative assemblies.    The practice of the National House of Representatives should have the  same force in this country as the usages of the House of Commons have in  England, in determining the general principles of the common  parliamentary law of the land; but it does not follow that in every  matter of detail the rules of Congress can be appealed to as the common  law governing every deliberative assembly.  In these matters of detail,  the rules of each House of Congress are adapted to their own peculiar  wants, and are of no force whatever in other assemblies.    === Page 11 ============================================================    But upon all great parliamentary questions, such as what motions can be  made, what is their order of precedence, which can be debated, what is  their effect, etc., the common law of the land is settled by the  practice of the U. S. House of Representatives, and not by that of the  English Parliament, the U. S. Senate, or any other body.    While in extreme cases there is no difficulty in deciding the question  as to whether the practice of Congress determines the common  parliamentary law, yet between these extremes there must necessarily be  a large number of doubtful cases upon which there would be great  difference of opinion, and to avoid the serious difficulties always  arising from a lack of definiteness in the law, every deliberative  assembly should imitate our legislative bodies in adopting Rules of  Order for the conduct of their business.* [Where the practice of  Congress differs from that of Parliament upon a material point, the  common law of this country follows the practice of Congress.  Thus in  every American deliberative assembly having no rules for conducting  business, the motion to adjourn would be decided to be undebatable, as  in Congress, the English parliamentary law to the contrary  notwithstanding; so if the Previous Question were negatived, the debate  upon the subject would continue as in Congress, whereas in Parliament  the subject would be immediately dismissed; so too the Previous Question  could be moved when there was before the assembly a motion either to  amend, to commit, or to postpone definitely or indefinitely, just as in  Congress, notwithstanding that, according to English parliamentary law,  the Previous Question could not be moved under such circumstances.  When the rules of the two Houses of Congress conflict, the H. R. rules  are of greater authority than those of the Senate in determining the  parliamentary law of the country, just as the practice of the House of  Commons, and not the House of Lords, determines the parliamentary law of  England.  For instance, though the Senate rules do not allow the motion  for the Previous Question, and make the motion to postpone indefinitely  take precedence of every other subsidiary motion [Sec. 7] except to lie on  the table, yet the parliamentary law of the land follows the practice of  the House of Representatives, in recognizing the Previous Question as a  legitimate motion, and assigning to the very lowest rank the motion to  postpone indefinitely.  But in matters of detail, the rules of the House  of Representatives are adapted to the peculiar wants of that body, and  are of no authority in any other assembly.  No one for instance would  accept the following H. R. rules as common parliamentary law in this  country:  That the chairman, in case of disorderly conduct, would have  the power to order the galleries to be cleared; that the ballot could  not be used in electing the officers of an assembly; that any fifteen  members would be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members  and make them pay the expenses of the messengers sent after them; that  all committees not appointed by the Chair would have to be appointed by  ballot, and if the required number were not elected by a majority vote,  then a second ballot must be taken in which a plurality of votes would  prevail; that each member would be limited in debate upon any question,  to one hour; that a day's notice must be given of the introduction of a  bill, and that before its passage it must be read three times, and that  without the special order of the assembly it cannot be read twice the  same day.  These examples are sufficient to show the absurdity of the  idea that the rules of Congress in all things determine the common  parliamentary law.]    === Page 12 ============================="]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#2)"],[1,"prevents our at once  preparing one.    Not only do the events of the war on land teach very little to the  statesman who studies history in order to avoid in the present the  mistakes of the past, but besides this, the battles and campaigns  are of little interest to the student of military matters. The British  regulars, trained in many wars, thrashed the raw troops opposed to  them whenever they had any thing like a fair chance; but this is not  to be wondered at, for the same thing has always happened the world  over under similar conditions. Our defeats were exactly such as  any man might have foreseen, and there is nothing to be learned  from the follies committed by incompetent commanders and untrained  troops when in the presence of skilled officers having under them  disciplined soldiers. The humiliating surrenders, abortive attacks,  and panic routs of our armies can all be paralleled in the campaigns  waged by Napoleon's marshals against the Spaniards and Portuguese  in the years immediately preceding the outbreak of our own war. The  Peninsular troops were as little able to withstand the French veterans  as were our militia to hold their own against the British regulars.  But it must always be remembered, to our credit, that while seven  years of fighting failed to make the Spaniards able to face the  French,[Footnote: At the closing battle of Toulouse, fought between  the allies and the French, the flight of the Spaniards was so rapid  and universal as to draw from the Duke of Wellington the bitter  observation, that \"though he had seen a good many remarkable things  in the course of his life, yet this was the first time he had ever  seen ten thousand men running a race.\"] two years of warfare gave us  soldiers who could stand against the best men of Britain. On the  northern frontier we never developed a great general,--Brown's claim  to the title rests only on his not having committed the phenomenal  follies of his predecessors,--but by 1814 our soldiers had become  seasoned, and we had acquired some good brigade commanders, notably  Scott, so that in that year we played on even terms with the British.  But the battles, though marked by as bloody and obstinate fighting  as ever took place, were waged between small bodies of men, and were  not distinguished by any feats of generalship, so that they are not  of any special interest to the historian. In fact, the only really  noteworthy feat of arms of the war took place at New Orleans, and  the only military genius that the struggle developed was Andrew  Jackson. His deeds are worthy of all praise, and the battle he won  was in many ways so peculiar as to make it well worth a much closer  study than it has yet received. It was by far the most prominent  event of the war; it was a victory which reflected high honor on  the general and soldiers who won it, and it was in its way as  remarkable as any of the great battles that took place about the  same time in Europe. Such being the case, I have devoted a chapter  to its consideration at the conclusion of the chapters devoted to  the naval operations.    As before said, the other campaigns on land do not deserve very  minute attention; but, for the sake of rendering the account of the  battle of New Orleans more intelligible, I will give a hasty sketch  of the principal engagements that took place elsewhere.    The war opened in mid-summer of 1812, by the campaign of General  Hull on the Michigan frontier. With two or three thousand raw  troops he invaded Canada. About the same time Fort Mackinaw was  surrendered by its garrison of 60 Americans to a British and Indian  force of 600. Hull's campaign was unfortunate from the beginning.  Near Brownstown the American Colonel Van Horne, with some 200 men,  was ambushed and routed by Tecumseh and his Indians. In revenge  Col. Miller, with 600 Americans, at Maguaga attacked 150 British  and Canadians under Capt. Muir, and 250 Indians under Tecumseh,  and whipped them,--Tecumseh's Indians standing their ground longest.  The Americans lost 75, their foes 180 men. At Chicago the small  force of 66 Americans was surprised and massacred by the Indians.  Meanwhile, General Brock, the British commander, advanced against  Hull with a rapidity and decision that seemed to paralyze his  senile and irresolute opponent. The latter retreated to Detroit,  where, without striking a blow, he surrendered 1,400 men to Brock's  nearly equal force, which consisted nearly one half of Indians under  Tecumseh. On the Niagara frontier, an estimable and honest old  gentleman and worthy citizen, who knew nothing of military matters,  Gen. Van Rensselaer, tried to cross over and attack the British at  Queenstown; 1,100 Americans got across and were almost all killed or  captured by a nearly equal number of British, Canadians, and Indians,  while on the opposite side a large number of their countrymen looked  on, and with abject cowardice refused to cross to their assistance.  The command of the army was then handed over to a ridiculous  personage named Smythe, who issued proclamations so bombastic that  they really must have come from an unsound mind, and then made a  ludicrously abortive effort at invasion, which failed almost of  its own accord. A British and Canadian force of less than 400 men  was foiled in an assault on Ogdensburg, after a slight skirmish,  by about 1,000 Americans under Brown; and with this trifling  success the military operations of the year came to an end.    Early in 1813, Ogdensburg was again attacked, this time by between  500 and 600 British, who took it after a brisk resistance from some  300 militia; the British lost 60 and the Americans 20, in killed  and wounded. General Harrison, meanwhile, had begun the campaign  in the Northwest. At Frenchtown, on the river Raisin, Winchester's  command of about 900 Western troops was surprised by a force of  1,100 men, half of them Indians, under the British Colonel Proctor.  The right division, taken by surprise, gave up at once; the left  division, mainly Kentucky riflemen, and strongly posted in houses  and stockaded enclosures, made a stout resistance, and only  surrendered after a bloody fight, in which 180 British and about  half as many Indians were killed or wounded. Over 300 Americans  were slain, some in battle, but most in the bloody massacre that  followed. After this, General Harrison went into camp at Fort Meigs,  where, with about 1,100 men, he was besieged by 1,000 British and  Canadians under Proctor and 1,200 Indians under Tecumseh. A force  of 1,200 Kentucky militia advanced to his relief and tried to cut  its way into the fort while the garrison made a sortie. The sortie  was fairly successful, but the Kentuckians were scattered like  chaff by the British regulars in the open, and when broken were  cut to pieces by the Indians in the woods. Nearly two thirds of  the relieving troops were killed or captured; about 400 got into  the fort. Soon afterward Proctor abandoned the siege. Fort Stephenson,  garrisoned by Major Croghan and 160 men, was attacked by a force  of 391 British regulars, who tried to carry it by assault, and  were repulsed with the loss of a fourth of their number. Some four  thousand Indians joined Proctor, but most of them left him after  Perry's victory on Lake Erie. Then Harrison, having received large  reinforcements, invaded Canada. At the River Thames his army of 3,500  men encountered and routed between 600 and 700 British under Proctor,  and about 1,000 Indians under Tecumseh. The battle was decided at  once by a charge of the Kentucky mounted riflemen, who broke through  the regulars, took them in rear, and captured them, and then  dismounting attacked the flank of the Indians, who were also  assailed by the infantry. Proctor escaped by the skin of his teeth  and Tecumseh died fighting, like the hero that he was. This battle  ended the campaign in the Northwest. In this quarter it must be  remembered that the war was, on the part of the Americans, mainly  one against Indians; the latter always forming over half of the  British forces. Many of the remainder were French Canadians, and  the others were regulars. The American armies, on the contrary,  were composed of the armed settlers of Kentucky and Ohio, native  Americans, of English speech and blood, who were battling for lands  that were to form the heritage of their children. In the West the  war was only the closing act of the struggle that for many years  had been waged by the hardy and restless pioneers of our race, as  with rifle and axe they carved out the mighty empire that we their  children inherit; it was but the final effort with which they wrested  from the Indian lords of the soil the wide and fair domain that now  forms the heart of our great Republic. It was the breaking down of  the last barrier that stayed the flood of our civilization; it  settled, once and for ever, that henceforth the law, the tongue,  and the blood of the land should be neither Indian, nor yet French,  but English. The few French of the West were fighting against a  race that was to leave as little trace of them as of the doomed  Indian peoples with whom they made common cause. The presence of  the British mercenaries did not alter the character of the contest;  it merely served to show the bitter and narrow hatred with which  the Mother-Island regarded her greater daughter, predestined as  the latter was to be queen of the lands that lay beyond the Atlantic.    Meanwhile, on Lake Ontario, the Americans made successful descents  on York and Fort George, scattering or capturing their comparatively  small garrisons; while a counter descent by the British on Sackett's  Harbor failed, the attacking force being too small. After the capture  of Fort George, the Americans invaded Canada; but their advance guard,  1,400 strong, under Generals Chandler and Winder, was surprised in  the night by 800 British, who, advancing with the"]]]
