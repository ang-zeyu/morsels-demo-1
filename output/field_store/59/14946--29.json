[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#2)"],[1," moment the two officers came within firing distance of the  beast they would put an end to him in short order unless something were  done and done quickly to prevent.  The ape had made no move to attack  the Russian but even so the man was none too sure of what might happen  were he to interfere with the savage beast, now thoroughly aroused to  bestial rage, and with the smell of new spilled blood fresh in its  nostrils.  For an instant he hesitated, and then again there rose  before him the dreams of affluence which this great anthropoid would  doubtless turn to realities once Paulvitch had landed him safely in  some great metropolis like London.    The captain was shouting to him now to stand aside that he might have a  shot at the animal; but instead Paulvitch shuffled to the ape's side,  and though the man's hair quivered at its roots he mastered his fear  and laid hold of the ape's arm.    \"Come!\" he commanded, and tugged to pull the beast from among the  sailors, many of whom were now sitting up in wide eyed fright or  crawling away from their conqueror upon hands and knees.    Slowly the ape permitted itself to be led to one side, nor did it show  the slightest indication of a desire to harm the Russian.  The captain  came to a halt a few paces from the odd pair.    \"Get aside, Sabrov!\" he commanded.  \"I'll put that brute where he won't  chew up any more able seamen.\"    \"It wasn't his fault, captain,\" pleaded Paulvitch.  \"Please don't shoot  him.  The men started it--they attacked him first.  You see, he's  perfectly gentle--and he's mine--he's mine--he's mine!  I won't let you  kill him,\" he concluded, as his half-wrecked mentality pictured anew  the pleasure that money would buy in London--money that he could not  hope to possess without some such windfall as the ape represented.    The captain lowered his weapon.  \"The men started it, did they?\" he  repeated.  \"How about that?\" and he turned toward the sailors who had  by this time picked themselves from the ground, none of them much the  worse for his experience except the fellow who had been the cause of  it, and who would doubtless nurse a sore shoulder for a week or so.    \"Simpson done it,\" said one of the men.  \"He stuck a pin into the monk  from behind, and the monk got him--which served him bloomin' well  right--an' he got the rest of us, too, for which I can't blame him,  since we all jumped him to once.\"    The captain looked at Simpson, who sheepishly admitted the truth of the  allegation, then he stepped over to the ape as though to discover for  himself the sort of temper the beast possessed, but it was noticeable  that he kept his revolver cocked and leveled as he did so.  However, he  spoke soothingly to the animal who squatted at the Russian's side  looking first at one and then another of the sailors.  As the captain  approached him the ape half rose and waddled forward to meet him.  Upon  his countenance was the same strange, searching expression that had  marked his scrutiny of each of the sailors he had first encountered.  He came quite close to the officer and laid a paw upon one of the man's  shoulders, studying his face intently for a long moment, then came the  expression of disappointment accompanied by what was almost a human  sigh, as he turned away to peer in the same curious fashion into the  faces of the mate and the two sailors who had arrived with the  officers.  In each instance he sighed and passed on, returning at  length to Paulvitch's side, where he squatted down once more;  thereafter evincing little or no interest in any of the other men, and  apparently forgetful of his recent battle with them.    When the party returned aboard the Marjorie W., Paulvitch was  accompanied by the ape, who seemed anxious to follow him.  The captain  interposed no obstacles to the arrangement, and so the great anthropoid  was tacitly admitted to membership in the ship's company.  Once aboard  he examined each new face minutely, evincing the same disappointment in  each instance that had marked his scrutiny of the others.  The officers  and scientists aboard often discussed the beast, but they were unable  to account satisfactorily for the strange ceremony with which he  greeted each new face.  Had he been discovered upon the mainland, or  any other place than the almost unknown island that had been his home,  they would have concluded that he had formerly been a pet of man; but  that theory was not tenable in the face of the isolation of his  uninhabited island.  He seemed continually to be searching for someone,  and during the first days of the return voyage from the island he was  often discovered nosing about in various parts of the ship; but after  he had seen and examined each face of the ship's company, and explored  every corner of the vessel he lapsed into utter indifference of all  about him.  Even the Russian elicited only casual interest when he  brought him food.  At other times the ape appeared merely to tolerate  him.  He never showed affection for him, or for anyone else upon the  Marjorie W., nor did he at any time evince any indication of the savage  temper that had marked his resentment of the attack of the sailors upon  him at the time that he had come among them.    Most of his time was spent in the eye of the ship scanning the horizon  ahead, as though he were endowed with sufficient reason to know that  the vessel was bound for some port where there would be other human  beings to undergo his searching scrutiny.  All in all, Ajax, as he had  been dubbed, was considered the most remarkable and intelligent ape  that any one aboard the Marjorie W. ever had seen.  Nor was his  intelligence the only remarkable attribute he owned.  His stature and  physique were, for an ape, awe inspiring.  That he was old was quite  evident, but if his age had impaired his physical or mental powers in  the slightest it was not apparent.    And so at length the Marjorie W. came to England, and there the  officers and the scientists, filled with compassion for the pitiful  wreck of a man they had rescued from the jungles, furnished Paulvitch  with funds and bid him and his Ajax Godspeed.    Upon the dock and all through the journey to London the Russian had his  hands full with Ajax.  Each new face of the thousands that came within  the anthropoid's ken must be carefully scrutinized, much to the horror  of many of his victims; but at last, failing, apparently, to discover  whom he sought, the great ape relapsed into morbid indifference, only  occasionally evincing interest in a passing face.    In London, Paulvitch went directly with his prize to a certain famous  animal trainer.  This man was much impressed with Ajax with the result  that he agreed to train him for a lion's share of the profits of  exhibiting him, and in the meantime to provide for the keep of both the  ape and his owner.    And so came Ajax to London, and there was forged another link in the  chain of strange circumstances that were to affect the lives of many  people.          Chapter 2      Mr. Harold Moore was a bilious-countenanced, studious young man.  He  took himself very seriously, and life, and his work, which latter was  the tutoring of the young son of a British nobleman.  He felt that his  charge was not making the progress that his parents had a right to  expect, and he was now conscientiously explaining this fact to the  boy's mother.    \"It's not that he isn't bright,\" he was saying; \"if that were true I  should have hopes of succeeding, for then I might bring to bear all my  energies in overcoming his obtuseness; but the trouble is that he is  exceptionally intelligent, and learns so quickly that I can find no  fault in the matter of the preparation of his lessons.  What concerns  me, however, is the fact that he evidently takes no interest whatever  in the subjects we are studying.  He merely accomplishes each lesson as  a task to be rid of as quickly as possible and I am sure that no lesson  ever again enters his mind until the hours of study and recitation once  more arrive.  His sole interests seem to be feats of physical prowess  and the reading of everything that he can get hold of relative to  savage beasts and the lives and customs of uncivilized peoples; but  particularly do stories of animals appeal to him.  He will sit for  hours together poring over the work of some African explorer, and upon  two occasions I have found him setting up in bed at night reading Carl  Hagenbeck's book on men and beasts.\"    The boy's mother tapped her foot nervously upon the hearth rug.    \"You discourage this, of course?\" she ventured.    Mr. Moore shuffled embarrassedly.    \"I--ah--essayed to take the book from him,\" he replied, a slight flush  mounting his sallow cheek; \"but--ah--your son is quite muscular for one  so young.\"    \"He wouldn't let you take it?\" asked the mother.    \"He would not,\" confessed the tutor.  \"He was perfectly good natured  about it; but he insisted upon pretending that he was a gorilla and  that I was a chimpanzee attempting to steal food from him.  He leaped  upon me with the most savage growls I ever heard, lifted me completely  above his head, hurled me upon his bed, and after going through a  pantomime indicative of choking me to death he stood upon my prostrate  form and gave voice to a most fearsome shriek, which he explained was  the victory cry of a bull ape.  Then he carried me to the door, shoved  me out into the hall and locked me from his room.\"    For several minutes neither spoke again.  It was the boy's mother who  finally broke the silence.    \"It is very necessary, Mr. Moore,\" she said, \"that you do everything in  your power to discourage this tendency in Jack, he--\"; but she got no  further.  A loud \"Whoop!\" from the direction of the window brought them  both to their feet.  The room was upon the second floor of the house,  and opposite the window to which their attention had been attracted was  a large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#2)"],[1," brother Ambrose,\" said he. \"May the  holy Benedict, patron of our house, be present this day and aid us in  our findings! How many counts are there?\"    \"Three, most holy father,\" the brother answered in a low and quavering  voice.    \"Have you set them forth according to rule?\"    \"They are here set down, most holy father, upon a cantle of sheep-skin.\"    \"Let the sheep-skin be handed to the chancellor. Bring in brother John,  and let him hear the plaints which have been urged against him.\"    At this order a lay-brother swung open the door, and two other  lay-brothers entered leading between them a young novice of the order.  He was a man of huge stature, dark-eyed and red-headed, with a peculiar  half-humorous, half-defiant expression upon his bold, well-marked  features. His cowl was thrown back upon his shoulders, and his gown,  unfastened at the top, disclosed a round, sinewy neck, ruddy and corded  like the bark of the fir. Thick, muscular arms, covered with a reddish  down, protruded from the wide sleeves of his habit, while his white  shirt, looped up upon one side, gave a glimpse of a huge knotty leg,  scarred and torn with the scratches of brambles. With a bow to the  Abbot, which had in it perhaps more pleasantry than reverence, the  novice strode across to the carved prie-dieu which had been set apart  for him, and stood silent and erect with his hand upon the gold bell  which was used in the private orisons of the Abbot's own household. His  dark eyes glanced rapidly over the assembly, and finally settled with a  grim and menacing twinkle upon the face of his accuser.    The chancellor rose, and having slowly unrolled the parchment-scroll,  proceeded to read it out in a thick and pompous voice, while a subdued  rustle and movement among the brothers bespoke the interest with which  they followed the proceedings.    \"Charges brought upon the second Thursday after the Feast of the  Assumption, in the year of our Lord thirteen hundred and sixty-six,  against brother John, formerly known as Hordle John, or John of Hordle,  but now a novice in the holy monastic order of the Cistercians. Read  upon the same day at the Abbey of Beaulieu in the presence of the most  reverend Abbot Berghersh and of the assembled order.    \"The charges against the said brother John are the following, namely, to  wit:    \"First, that on the above-mentioned Feast of the Assumption, small beer  having been served to the novices in the proportion of one quart to  each four, the said brother John did drain the pot at one draught to  the detriment of brother Paul, brother Porphyry and brother Ambrose,  who could scarce eat their none-meat of salted stock-fish on account of  their exceeding dryness.\"    At this solemn indictment the novice raised his hand and twitched his  lip, while even the placid senior brothers glanced across at each other  and coughed to cover their amusement. The Abbot alone sat gray and  immutable, with a drawn face and a brooding eye.    \"Item, that having been told by the master of the novices that he should  restrict his food for two days to a single three-pound loaf of bran and  beans, for the greater honoring and glorifying of St. Monica, mother of  the holy Augustine, he was heard by brother Ambrose and others to say  that he wished twenty thousand devils would fly away with the said  Monica, mother of the holy Augustine, or any other saint who came  between a man and his meat. Item, that upon brother Ambrose reproving  him for this blasphemous wish, he did hold the said brother face  downwards over the piscatorium or fish-pond for a space during which  the said brother was able to repeat a pater and four aves for the better  fortifying of his soul against impending death.\"    There was a buzz and murmur among the white-frocked brethren at this  grave charge; but the Abbot held up his long quivering hand. \"What  then?\" said he.    \"Item, that between nones and vespers on the feast of James the Less the  said brother John was observed upon the Brockenhurst road, near the spot  which is known as Hatchett's Pond in converse with a person of the other  sex, being a maiden of the name of Mary Sowley, the daughter of the  King's verderer. Item, that after sundry japes and jokes the said  brother John did lift up the said Mary Sowley and did take, carry, and  convey her across a stream, to the infinite relish of the devil and the  exceeding detriment of his own soul, which scandalous and wilful falling  away was witnessed by three members of our order.\"    A dead silence throughout the room, with a rolling of heads and  upturning of eyes, bespoke the pious horror of the community.    The Abbot drew his gray brows low over his fiercely questioning eyes.    \"Who can vouch for this thing?\" he asked.    \"That can I,\" answered the accuser. \"So too can brother Porphyry, who  was with me, and brother Mark of the Spicarium, who hath been so much  stirred and inwardly troubled by the sight that he now lies in a fever  through it.\"    \"And the woman?\" asked the Abbot. \"Did she not break into lamentation  and woe that a brother should so demean himself?\"    \"Nay, she smiled sweetly upon him and thanked him. I can vouch it and so  can brother Porphyry.\"    \"Canst thou?\" cried the Abbot, in a high, tempestuous tone. \"Canst thou  so? Hast forgotten that the five-and-thirtieth rule of the order is that  in the presence of a woman the face should be ever averted and the eyes  cast down? Hast forgot it, I say? If your eyes were upon your sandals,  how came ye to see this smile of which ye prate? A week in your cells,  false brethren, a week of rye-bread and lentils, with double lauds and  double matins, may help ye to remembrance of the laws under which ye  live.\"    At this sudden outflame of wrath the two witnesses sank their faces on  to their chests, and sat as men crushed. The Abbot turned his angry eyes  away from them and bent them upon the accused, who met his searching  gaze with a firm and composed face.    \"What hast thou to say, brother John, upon these weighty things which  are urged against you?\"    \"Little enough, good father, little enough,\" said the novice, speaking  English with a broad West Saxon drawl. The brothers, who were English  to a man, pricked up their ears at the sound of the homely and yet  unfamiliar speech; but the Abbot flushed red with anger, and struck his  hand upon the oaken arm of his chair.    \"What talk is this?\" he cried. \"Is this a tongue to be used within the  walls of an old and well-famed monastery? But grace and learning have  ever gone hand in hand, and when one is lost it is needless to look for  the other.\"    \"I know not about that,\" said brother John. \"I know only that the words  come kindly to my mouth, for it was the speech of my fathers before me.  Under your favor, I shall either use it now or hold my peace.\"    The Abbot patted his foot and nodded his head, as one who passes a point  but does not forget it.    \"For the matter of the ale,\" continued brother John, \"I had come in hot  from the fields and had scarce got the taste of the thing before  mine eye lit upon the bottom of the pot. It may be, too, that I spoke  somewhat shortly concerning the bran and the beans, the same being poor  provender and unfitted for a man of my inches. It is true also that I  did lay my hands upon this jack-fool of a brother Ambrose, though, as  you can see, I did him little scathe. As regards the maid, too, it is  true that I did heft her over the stream, she having on her hosen and  shoon, whilst I had but my wooden sandals, which could take no hurt from  the water. I should have thought shame upon my manhood, as well as my  monkhood, if I had held back my hand from her.\" He glanced around as  he spoke with the half-amused look which he had worn during the whole  proceedings.    \"There is no need to go further,\" said the Abbot. \"He has confessed to  all. It only remains for me to portion out the punishment which is due  to his evil conduct.\"    He rose, and the two long lines of brothers followed his example,  looking sideways with scared faces at the angry prelate.    \"John of Hordle,\" he thundered, \"you have shown yourself during the two  months of your novitiate to be a recreant monk, and one who is unworthy  to wear the white garb which is the outer symbol of the spotless spirit.  That dress shall therefore be stripped from thee, and thou shalt be cast  into the outer world without benefit of clerkship, and without lot or  part in the graces and blessings of those who dwell under the care of  the Blessed Benedict. Thou shalt come back neither to Beaulieu nor to  any of the granges of Beaulieu, and thy name shall be struck off the  scrolls of the order.\"    The sentence appeared a terrible one to the older monks, who had become  so used to the safe and regular life of the Abbey that they would have  been as helpless as children in the outer world. From their pious  oasis they looked dreamily out at the desert of life, a place full of  stormings and strivings--comfortless, restless, and overshadowed by  evil. The young novice, however, appeared to have other thoughts, for  his eyes sparkled and his smile broadened. It needed but that to add  fresh fuel to the fiery mood of the prelate.    \"So much for thy spiritual punishment,\" he cried. \"But it is to thy  grosser feelings that we must turn in such natures as thine, and as  thou art no longer under the shield of holy church there is the less  difficulty. Ho there! lay-brothers--Francis, Naomi, Joseph--seize him  and bind his arms! Drag him forth, and let the foresters and the porters  scourge him from the precincts!\"    As these three brothers advanced towards him to carry out the Abbot's  direction, the smile faded from the novice's face, and he glanced right  and left with his fierce brown eyes, like a bull at a baiting. Then,  with a sudden deep-chested shout, he tore up the heavy oaken prie-dieu  and poised it to strike,"]]]
