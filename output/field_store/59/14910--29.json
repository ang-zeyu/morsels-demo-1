Selah.    19:010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in             times of trouble?    19:010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be             taken in the devices that they have imagined.    19:010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth             the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.    19:010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not             seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.    19:010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out             of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.    19:010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall             never be in adversity.    19:010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his             tongue is mischief and vanity.    19:010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the             secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are             privily set against the poor.    19:010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in             wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he             draweth him into his net.    19:010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by             his strong ones.    19:010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his             face; he will never see it.    19:010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the             humble.    19:010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his             heart, Thou wilt not require it.    19:010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to             requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto             thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.    19:010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out             his wickedness till thou find none.    19:010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished             out of his land.    19:010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt             prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:    19:010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the             earth may no more oppress.    19:011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a             bird to your mountain?    19:011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their             arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the             upright in heart.    19:011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?    19:011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in             heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.    19:011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that             loveth violence his soul hateth.    19:011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and             an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.    19:011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance             doth behold the upright.    19:012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail             from among the children of men.    19:012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with             flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.    19:012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue             that speaketh proud things:    19:012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are             our own: who is lord over us?    19:012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,             now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety             from him that puffeth at him.    19:012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a             furnace of earth, purified seven times.    19:012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from             this generation for ever.    19:012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are             exalted.    19:013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt             thou hide thy face from me?    19:013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my             heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?    19:013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I             sleep the sleep of death;    19:013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those             that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.    19:013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy             salvation.    19:013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully             with me.    19:014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are             corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that             doeth good.    19:014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to             see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.    19:014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:             there is none that doeth good, no, not one.    19:014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my             people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.    19:014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of             the righteous.    19:014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is             his refuge.    19:014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when             the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob             shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.    19:015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in             thy holy hill?    19:015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and             speaketh the truth in his heart.    19:015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his             neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.    19:015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth             them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and             changeth not.    19:015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward             against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never             be moved.    19:016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.    19:016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my             goodness extendeth not to thee;    19:016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,             in whom is all my delight.    19:016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another             god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take             up their names into my lips.    19:0"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8020"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 20: Proverbs (#2)"],[1,"my mother.    20:004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my             words: keep my commandments, and live.    20:004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline             from the words of my mouth.    20:004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and             she shall keep thee.    20:004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with             all thy getting get understanding.    20:004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to             honour, when thou dost embrace her.    20:004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of             glory shall she deliver to thee.    20:004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy             life shall be many.    20:004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in             right paths.    20:004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when             thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.    20:004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for             she is thy life.    20:004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way             of evil men.    20:004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.    20:004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their             sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.    20:004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of             violence.    20:004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth             more and more unto the perfect day.    20:004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what             they stumble.    20:004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.    20:004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of             thine heart.    20:004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all             their flesh.    20:004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the             issues of life.    20:004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far             from thee.    20:004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look             straight before thee.    20:004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be             established.    20:004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot             from evil.    20:005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my             understanding:    20:005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep             knowledge.    20:005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her             mouth is smoother than oil:    20:005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.    20:005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.    20:005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are             moveable, that thou canst not know them.    20:005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the             words of my mouth.    20:005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her             house:    20:005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto             the cruel:    20:005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be             in the house of a stranger;    20:005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are             consumed,    20:005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised             reproof;    20:005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined             mine ear to them that instructed me!    20:005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and             assembly.    20:005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out             of thine own well.    20:005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in             the streets.    20:005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.    20:005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy             youth.    20:005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her             breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always             with her love.    20:005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,             and embrace the bosom of a stranger?    20:005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he             pondereth all his goings.    20:005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall             be holden with the cords of his sins.    20:005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his             folly he shall go astray.    20:006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast             stricken thy hand with a stranger,    20:006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken             with the words of thy mouth.    20:006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come             into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure             thy friend.    20:006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.    20:006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a             bird from the hand of the fowler.    20:006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:    20:006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,    20:006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in             the harvest.    20:006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out             of thy sleep?    20:006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the             hands to sleep:    20:006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want             as an armed man.    20:006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.    20:006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he             teacheth with his fingers;    20:006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;             he soweth discord.    20:006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he             be broken without remedy.    20:006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an             abomination unto him:    20:006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent             blood,    20:006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift             in running to mischief,    20:006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord             among brethren.    20:006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law             of thy mother:    20:006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy             neck.    20:006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it             shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with             thee.    20:006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and             reproofs of instruction are the way of life:    20:006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the             tongue of a strange woman.    20:006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take             thee with her eyelids.    20:006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of             bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.    20:006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be             burned?    20:006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?    20:006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever             toucheth her shall not be innocent.    20:006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul             when he is hungry;    20:006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give             all the substance of his house.    20:006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh             understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.    20:006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not             be wiped away.    20:006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare             in the day of vengeance.    20:006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,             though thou givest many gifts.    20:007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.    20:007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of             thine eye.    20:007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine             heart.    20:007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister;
