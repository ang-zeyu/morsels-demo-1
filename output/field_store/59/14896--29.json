If we could find precise answers to these several questions, they  would constitute a characterization of Jewish History as accurate as  is attainable. To present such a characterization succinctly is the  purpose of the following essay.          JEWISH HISTORY    AN ESSAY IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY          I    THE RANGE OF JEWISH HISTORY          Le peuple juif n'est pas seulement considerable par son      antiquite, mais il est encore singulier en sa duree, qui a      toujours continue depuis son origine jusqu'a maintenant ...      S'etendant depuis les premiers temps jusqu'aux derniers,      l'histoire des juifs enferme dans sa duree celle de toutes nos      histoires.--PASCAL, _Pensees_, II, 7.    To make clear the range of Jewish history, it is necessary to set down  a few general, elementary definitions by way of introduction.    It has long been recognized that a fundamental difference exists  between historical and unhistorical peoples, a difference growing out  of the fact of the natural inequality between the various elements  composing the human race. Unhistorical is the attribute applied to  peoples that have not yet broken away, or have not departed very far,  from the state of primitive savagery, as, for instance, the barbarous  races of Asia and Africa who were the prehistoric ancestors of the  Europeans, or the obscure, untutored tribes of the present, like the  Tartars and the Kirghiz. Unhistorical peoples, then, are ethnic groups  of all sorts that are bereft of a distinctive, spiritual  individuality, and have failed to display normal, independent capacity  for culture. The term historical, on the other hand, is applied to the  nations that have had a conscious, purposeful history of appreciable  duration; that have progressed, stage by stage, in their growth and in  the improvement of their mode and their views of life; that have  demonstrated mental productivity of some sort, and have elaborated  principles of civilization and social life more or less rational;  nations, in short, representing not only zoologic, but also spiritual  types.[2]      [2] \"The primitive peoples that change with their environment,      constantly adapting themselves to their habitat and to      external nature, have no history.... Only those nations and      states belong to history which display self-conscious action;      which evince an inner spiritual life by diversified      manifestations; and combine into an organic whole what they      receive from without, and what they themselves originate.\"      (Introduction to Weber's _Allgemeine Weltgeschichte_, i,      pp. 16-18.)    Chronologically considered, these latter nations, of a higher type,  are usually divided into three groups: 1, the most ancient civilized  peoples of the Orient, such as the Chinese, the Hindoos, the  Egyptians, the Chaldeans; 2, the ancient or classic peoples of the  Occident, the Greeks and the Romans; and 3, the modern peoples, the  civilized nations of Europe and America of the present day. The most  ancient peoples of the Orient, standing \"at the threshold of history,\"  were the first heralds of a religious consciousness and of moral  principles. In hoary antiquity, when most of the representatives of  the human kind were nothing more than a peculiar variety of the class  mammalia, the peoples called the most ancient brought forth recognized  forms of social life and a variety of theories of living of fairly  far-reaching effect. All these culture-bearers of the Orient soon  disappeared from the surface of history. Some (the Chaldeans,  Phoenicians, and Egyptians) were washed away by the flood of time, and  their remnants were absorbed by younger and more vigorous peoples.  Others (the Hindoos and Persians) relapsed into a semi-barbarous  state; and a third class (the Chinese) were arrested in their growth,  and remained fixed in immobility. The best that the antique Orient had  to bequeath in the way of spiritual possessions fell to the share of  the classic nations of the West, the Greeks and the Romans. They  greatly increased the heritage by their own spiritual achievements,  and so produced a much more complex and diversified civilization,  which has served as the substratum for the further development of the  better part of mankind. Even the classic nations had to step aside as  soon as their historical mission was fulfilled. They left the field  free for the younger nations, with greater capability of living, which  at that time had barely worked their way up to the beginnings of a  civilization. One after the other, during the first two centuries of  the Christian era, the members of this European family of nations  appeared in the arena of history. They form the kernel of the  civilized part of mankind at the present day.    Now, if we examine this accepted classification with a view to finding  the place belonging to the Jewish people in the chronological series,  we meet with embarrassing difficulties, and finally arrive at the  conclusion that its history cannot be accommodated within the compass  of the classification. Into which of the three historical groups  mentioned could the Jewish people be put? Are we to call it one of the  most ancient, one of the ancient, or one of the modern nations? It is  evident that it may lay claim to the first description, as well as to  the second and the last. In company with the most ancient nations of  the Orient, the Jewish people stood at the \"threshold of history.\" It  was the contemporary of the earliest civilized nations, the Egyptians  and the Chaldeans. In those remote days it created and spread a  religious world-idea underlying an exalted social and moral system  surpassing everything produced in this sphere by its Oriental  contemporaries. Again, with the classical Greeks and Romans, it forms  the celebrated historical triad universally recognized as the source  of all great systems of civilization. Finally, in fellowship with the  nations of to-day, it leads an historical life, striding onward in the  path of progress without stay or interruption. Deprived of political  independence, it nevertheless continues to fill a place in the world  of thought as a distinctly marked spiritual individuality, as one of  the most active and intelligent forces. How, then, are we to  denominate this omnipresent people, which, from the first moment of  its historical existence up to our days, a period of thirty-five  hundred years, has been developing continuously. In view of this  Methuselah among the nations, whose life is co-extensive with the  whole of history, how are we to dispose of the inevitable barriers  between \"the most ancient\" and \"the ancient,\" between \"the ancient\"  and \"the modern\" nations--the fateful barriers which form the  milestones on the path of the historical peoples, and which the Jewish  people has more than once overstepped?    A definition of the Jewish people must needs correspond to the  aggregate of the concepts expressed by the three group-names, most  ancient, ancient, and modern. The only description applicable to it is  \"the historical nation of all times,\" a description bringing into  relief the contrast between it and all other nations of modern and  ancient times, whose historical existence either came to an end in  days long past, or began at a date comparatively recent. And granted  that there are \"historical\" and \"unhistorical\" peoples, then it is  beyond dispute that the Jewish people deserves to be called \"the most  historical\" (_historicissimus_). If the history of the world be  conceived as a circle, then Jewish history occupies the position of  the diameter, the line passing through its centre, and the history of  every other nation is represented by a chord marking off a smaller  segment of the circle. The history of the Jewish people is like an  axis crossing the history of mankind from one of its poles to the  other. As an unbroken thread it runs through the ancient civilization  of Egypt and Mesopotamia, down to the present-day culture of France  and Germany. Its divisions are measured by thousands of years.    Jewish history, then, in its range, or, better, in its duration,  presents an unique phenomenon. It consists of the longest series of  events ever recorded in the annals of a single people. To sum up its  peculiarity briefly, it embraces a period of thirty-five hundred  years, and in all this vast extent it suffers no interruption. At  every point it is alive, full of sterling content. Presently we shall  see that in respect to content, too, it is distinguished by  exceptional characteristics.          II    THE CONTENT OF JEWISH HISTORY      From the point of view of content, or qualitative structure, Jewish  history, it is well known, falls into two parts. The dividing point  between the two parts is the moment in which the Jewish state  collapsed irretrievably under the blows of the Roman Empire (70 C.  E.). The first half deals with the vicissitudes of a nation, which,  though frequently at the mercy of stronger nations, still maintained  possession of its territory and government, and was ruled by its own  laws. In the second half, we encounter the history of a people without  a government, more than that, without a land, a people stripped of all  the tangible accompaniments of nationality, and nevertheless  successful in preserving its spiritual unity, its originality,  complete and undiminished.    At first glance, Jewish history during the period of independence  seems to be but slightly different from the history of other nations.  Though not without individual coloring, there are yet the same wars  and intestine disturbances, the same political revolutions and  dynastic quarrels, the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838"],[0,"Fifty-One Tales (#2)"],[1,"strength, or drive upon them the huge seafaring  bergs. I cross an ocean while you move a mile. There is mourning in  inland places when I have met the ships. I drive them upon the rocks  and feed the sea. Wherever I appear they bow to our lord the Winter.\"    And to his arrogant boasting nothing said the fog. Only he rose up  slowly and trailed away from the sea and, crawling up long valleys,  took refuge among the hills; and night came down and everything was  still, and the fog began to mumble in the stillness. And I heard him  telling infamously to himself the tale of his horrible spoils. \"A  hundred and fifteen galleons of old Spain, a certain argosy that went  from Tyre, eight fisher-fleets and ninety ships of the line, twelve  warships under sail, with their carronades, three hundred and  eighty-seven river-craft, forty-two merchantmen that carried spice,  four quinquiremes, ten triremes, thirty yachts, twenty-one battleships  of the modern time, nine thousand admirals....\" he mumbled and chuckled  on, till I suddenly arose and fled from his fearful contamination.          THE RAFT-BUILDERS      All we who write put me in mind of sailors hastily making rafts upon  doomed ships.    When we break up under the heavy years and go down into eternity  with all that is ours our thoughts like small lost rafts float on awhile  upon Oblivion's sea. They will not carry much over those tides, our  names and a phrase or two and little else.    They that write as a trade to please the whim of the day, they are like  sailors that work at the rafts only to warm their hands and to distract  their thoughts from their certain doom; their rafts go all to pieces  before the ship breaks up.    See now Oblivion shimmering all around us, its very tranquility deadlier  than tempest. How little all our keels have troubled it. Time in its deeps  swims like a monstrous whale; and, like a whale, feeds on the littlest  things--small tunes and little unskilled songs of the olden, golden  evenings--and anon turneth whale-like to overthrow whole ships.    See now the wreckage of Babylon floating idly, and something there  that once was Nineveh; already their kings and queens are in the  deeps among the weedy masses of old centuries that hide the sodden  bulk of sunken Tyre and make a darkness round Persepolis.    For the rest I dimly see the forms of foundered ships on the sea-floor  strewn with crowns.    Our ships were all unseaworthy from the first.    There goes the raft that Homer made for Helen.          THE WORKMAN      I saw a workman fall with his scaffolding right from the summit of  some vast hotel. And as he came down I saw him holding a knife  and trying to cut his name on the scaffolding. He had time to try and  do this for he must have had nearly three hundred feet to fall. And I  could think of nothing but his folly in doing this futile thing, for not  only would the man be unrecognizably dead in three seconds, but the  very pole on which he tried to scratch whatever of his name he had  time for was certain to be burnt in a few weeks for firewood.    Then I went home for I had work to do. And all that evening I thought  of the man's folly, till the thought hindered me from serious work.    And late that night while I was still at work, the ghost of the workman  floated through my wall and stood before me laughing.    I heard no sound until after I spoke to it; but I could see the grey  diaphanous form standing before me shuddering with laughter.    I spoke at last and asked what it was laughing at, and then the ghost  spoke. It said: \"I'm a laughin' at you sittin' and workin' there.\"    \"And why,\" I asked, \"do you laugh at serious work?\"    \"Why, yer bloomin' life 'ull go by like a wind,\" he said, \"and yer 'ole  silly civilization 'ull be tidied up in a few centuries.\"    Then he fell to laughing again and this time audibly; and, laughing  still, faded back through the wall again and into the eternity from  which he had come.          THE GUEST      A young man came into an ornate restaurant at eight o'clock in  London.    He was alone, but two places had been laid at the table which was  reserved for him. He had chosen the dinner very carefully, by letter  a week before.    A waiter asked him about the other guest.    \"You probably won't see him till the coffee comes,\" the young man  told him; so he was served alone.    Those at adjacent tables might have noticed the young man continually  addressing the empty chair and carrying on a monologue with it  throughout his elaborate dinner.    \"I think you knew my father,\" he said to it over the soup.    \"I sent for you this evening,\" he continued, \"because I want you to  do me a good turn; in fact I must insist on it.\"    There was nothing eccentric about the man except for this habit of  addressing an empty chair, certainly he was eating as good a dinner  as any sane man could wish for.    After the Burgundy had been served he became more voluble in his  monologue, not that he spoiled his wine by drinking excessively.    \"We have several acquaintances in common,\" he said. \"I met King Seti  a year ago in Thebes. I think he has altered very little since you knew  him. I thought his forehead a little low for a king's. Cheops has left the  house that he built for your reception, he must have prepared for you  for years and years. I suppose you have seldom been entertained like  that. I ordered this dinner over a week ago. I thought then that a lady  might have come with me, but as she wouldn't I've asked you. She may  not after all be as lovely as Helen of Troy. Was Helen very lovely? Not  when you knew her, perhaps. You were lucky in Cleopatra, you must  have known her when she was in her prime.    \"You never knew the mermaids nor the fairies nor the lovely goddesses  of long ago, that's where we have the best of you.\"    He was silent when the waiters came to his table, but rambled merrily  on as soon as they left, still turned to the empty chair.    \"You know I saw you here in London only the other day. You were  on a motor bus going down Ludgate Hill. It was going much too fast.  London is a good place. But I shall be glad enough to leave it. It was  in London that I met the lady I that was speaking about. If it hadn't  been for London I probably shouldn't have met her, and if it hadn't  been for London she probably wouldn't have had so much besides  me to amuse her. It cuts both ways.\"    He paused once to order coffee, gazing earnestly at the waiter and  putting a sovereign in his hand. \"Don't let it be chicory,\" said he.    The waiter brought the coffee, and the young man dropped a tabloid  of some sort into his cup.    \"I don't suppose you come here very often,\" he went on. \"Well, you  probably want to be going. I haven't taken you much out of your way,  there is plenty for you to do in London.\"    Then having drunk his coffee he fell on to the floor by a foot of the  empty chair, and a doctor who was dining in the room bent over  him and announced to the anxious manager the visible presence of  the young man's guest.          DEATH AND ODYSSEUS      In the Olympian courts Love laughed at Death, because he was  unsightly, and because She couldn't help it, and because he never  did anything worth doing, and because She would.    And Death hated being laughed at, and used to brood apart thinking  only of his wrongs and of what he could do to end this intolerable  treatment.    But one day Death appeared in the courts with an air and They all  noticed it. \"What are you up to now?\" said Love. And Death with  some solemnity said to Her: \"I am going to frighten Odysseus\"; and  drawing about him his grey traveller's cloak went out through the  windy door with his jowl turned earthwards.    And he came soon to Ithaca and the hall that Athene knew, and  opened the door and saw there famous Odysseus, with his white  locks bending close over the fire, trying to warm his hands.    And the wind through the open door blew bitterly on Odysseus.    And Death came up behind him, and suddenly shouted.    And Odysseus went on warming his pale hands.    Then Death came close and began to mouth at him. And after a  while Odysseus turned and spoke. And \"Well, old servant,\" he said,  \"have your masters been kind to you since I made you work for me  round Ilion?\"    And Death for some while stood mute, for he thought of the laughter  of Love.    Then \"Come now,\" said Odysseus, \"lend me your shoulder,\" and he  leaning heavily on that bony joint, they went together through the open  door.          DEATH AND THE ORANGE      Two dark young men in a foreign southern land sat at a restaurant  table with one woman.    And on the woman's plate was a small orange which had an evil  laughter in its heart.    And both of the men would be looking at the woman all the time, and  they ate little and they drank much.    And the woman was smiling equally at each.    Then the small orange that had the laughter in its heart rolled  slowly off the plate on to the floor. And the dark young men both  sought for it at once, and they met suddenly beneath the table, and  soon they were speaking swift words to one another, and a horror  and an impotence came over the Reason of each as she sat helpless  at the back of the mind, and the heart of the orange laughed and the  woman went on smiling; and Death, who was sitting at another table,  tete-a-tete with an old man, rose and came over to listen to the quarrel.          THE PRAYER OF THE FLOWERS      It was the voice of the flowers on the West wind, the lovable, the  old, the lazy West wind, blowing ceaselessly, blowing sleepily, going  Greecewards.    \"The woods have gone away, they have fallen and left us; men love  us no longer, we are lonely by moonlight. Great engines rush over  the beautiful fields, their ways lie hard and terrible up and down the  land.    \"The cancrous cities spread over the grass, they clatter in their lairs  continually, they glitter"]]]
