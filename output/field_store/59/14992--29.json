[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#20)"],[1,"Nations held its first  meeting and before I had reason to suspect that Mr. Wilson intended to  ignore the letter which I had sent him with the suggested resolution  enclosed, I determined to appeal to him in behalf of international  arbitration. I decided to do this on the assumption that, even if the  plan for a resolution was approved, the Commission would continue its  sessions in preparation for the subsequent negotiation of an agreement  of some sort providing for world organization. The provision as to  arbitration in the President's original draft of a Covenant was so wrong  from my point of view and showed such a lack of knowledge of the  practical side of the subject that I was impelled to make an effort to  induce him to change the provision. Except for the fact that the matter  was wholly legal in character and invited an opinion based on technical  knowledge, I would have remained silent in accordance with my feeling  that it would be inadvisable for me to have anything to do with drafting  the Covenant. I felt, however, that the constitution and procedure of  international courts were subjects which did not affect the general  theory of organization and concerning which my views might influence the  President and be of aid to him in the formulation of the judicial  feature of any plan adopted.    With this object in view I wrote to him the following letter:       \"_Hotel Crillon, Paris       \"February_ 3, 1919       \"My Dear Mr. President:       \"I am deeply interested, as you know, in the constitution and     procedure of international courts of arbitration, and having     participated in five proceedings of this sort I feel that I can speak     with a measure of authority.       \"In the first place let me say that a tribunal, on which     representatives of the litigants sit as judges, has not proved     satisfactory even though the majority of the tribunal are nationals     of other countries. However well prepared from experience on the     bench to render strict justice, the litigants' arbitrators act in     fact as advocates. As a consequence the neutral arbitrators are     decidedly hampered in giving full and free expression to their views,     and there is not that frank exchange of opinion which should     characterize the conference of judges. It has generally resulted in a     compromise, in which the nation in the wrong gains a measure of     benefit and the nation in the right is deprived of a part of the     remedy to which it is entitled. In fact an arbitration award is more     of a political and diplomatic arrangement than it is a judicial     determination. I believe that this undesirable result can be in large     measure avoided by eliminating arbitrators of the litigant nations.     It is only in the case of monetary claims that these observations do     not apply.       \"Another difficulty has been the method of procedure before     international tribunals. This does not apply to monetary claims, but     to disputes arising out of boundaries, interpretation of treaties,     national rights, etc. The present method of an exchange of cases and     of counter-cases is more diplomatic than judicial, since it does not     put the parties in the relation of complainant and defendant. This     relation can in every case be established, if not by mutual     agreement, then by some agency of the League of Nations charged with     that duty. Until this reform of procedure takes place there will be     no definition of issues, and arbitration will continue to be the long     and elaborate proceeding it has been in the past.       \"There is another practical obstacle to international arbitration as     now conducted which ought to be considered, and that is the cost.     This obstacle does not affect wealthy nations, but it does prevent     small and poor nations from resorting to it as a means of settling     disputes. Just how this can be remedied I am not prepared to say,     although possibly the international support of all arbitral tribunals     might be provided. At any rate, I feel that something should be done     to relieve the great expense which now prevents many of the smaller     nations from resorting to arbitration.       \"I would suggest, therefore, that the Peace Treaty contain a     provision directing the League of Nations to hold a conference or to     summon a conference to take up this whole matter and draft an     international treaty dealing with the constitution of arbitral     tribunals and radically revising the procedure.       \"On account of the difficulties of the subject, which do not appear     on the surface, but which experience has shown to be very real, I     feel that it would be impracticable to provide in the Peace Treaty     too definitely the method of constituting arbitral tribunals. It will     require considerable thought and discussion to make arbitration     available to the poor as well as the rich, to make an award a     judicial settlement rather than a diplomatic compromise, and to     supersede the cumbersome and prolonged procedure with its duplication     of documents and maps by a simple method which will settle the issues     and materially shorten the proceedings which now unavoidably drag     along for months, if not for years.       \"Faithfully yours       \"ROBERT LANSING       \"THE PRESIDENT       \"28 _Rue de Monceau_\"    At the time that I sent this letter to Mr. Wilson I had not seen the  revised draft of the Covenant which he laid before the Commission on the  League of Nations. The probability is that, if I had seen it, the letter  would not have been written, for in the revision of the original draft  the objectionable Article V, relating to arbitration and appeals from  arbitral awards, was omitted. In place of it there were substituted two  articles, 11 and 12, the first being an agreement to arbitrate under  certain conditions and the other providing that \"the Executive Council  will formulate plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of  International Justice, and this Court will be competent to hear and  determine any matter which the parties recognize as suitable for  submission to it for arbitration.\"    Unadvised as to this change, which promised a careful consideration of  the method of applying legal principles of justice to international  disputes, I did not feel that I could let pass without challenge the  unsatisfactory provisions of the President's original draft. Knowing the  contempt which Mr. Wilson felt for The Hague Tribunal and his general  suspicion of the justice of decisions which it might render, it seemed  to me inexpedient to suggest that it should form the basis of a newly  constituted judiciary, a suggestion which I should have made had I been  dealing with any one other than President Wilson. In view of the  intensity of the President's prejudices and of the uselessness of  attempting to remove them, my letter was intended to induce him to  postpone a determination of the subject until the problems which it  presented could be thoroughly studied and a judicial system developed by  an international body of representatives more expert in juridical  matters than the Commission on the League of Nations, the American  members of which were incompetent by training, knowledge, and practical  experience to consider the subject.    No acknowledgment, either written or oral, was ever made of my letter of  February 3. Possibly President Wilson considered it unnecessary to do so  in view of the provision in his revised Covenant postponing discussion  of the subject. At the time, however, I naturally assumed that my  voluntary advice was unwelcome to him. His silence as to my  communications, which seemed to be intended to discourage a continuance  of them, gave the impression that he considered an uninvited opinion on  any subject connected with the League of Nations an unwarranted  interference with a phase of the negotiations which he looked upon as  his own special province, and that comment or suggestion, which did not  conform wholly to his views, was interpreted into opposition and  possibly into criticism of him personally.    This judgment of the President's mental attitude, which was formed at  the time, may have been too harsh. It is possible that the shortness of  time in which to complete the drafting of the report of the Commission  on the League of Nations, upon which he had set his heart, caused him to  be impatient of any criticism or suggestion which tended to interrupt  his work or that of the Commission. It may have been that pressure for  time prevented him from answering letters of the character of the one of  February 3. Whatever the real reason was, the fact remains that the  letter went unnoticed and the impression was made that it was futile to  attempt to divert the President from the single purpose which he had in  mind. His fidelity to his own convictions and his unswerving  determination to attain what he sought are characteristics of Mr. Wilson  which are sources of weakness as well as of strength. Through them  success has generally crowned his efforts, success which in some  instances has been more disastrous than failure would have been.    By what means the change of Article V of the original draft of the  Covenant took place, I cannot say. In the memorandum of Messrs. Miller  and Auchincloss no suggestion of a Court of International Justice  appears, which seems to indicate that the provision in the revised draft  did not originate with them or with Colonel House. In fact on more than  one occasion I had mentioned arbitration to the Colonel and found his  views on the subject extremely vague, though I concluded that he had  almost as poor an opinion of The Hague Tribunal as did the President.  The probability is that the change was suggested to Mr. Wilson by one of  the foreign statesmen in a personal interview during January and that  upon sounding others he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10477"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 01: The Old Pagan Civilizations (#20)"],[1,"orrupt, but, as we have  already said, his reproofs were gentle. Blandness of speech and manners  was his distinguishing outward peculiarity; and this seems to  characterize his nation,--whether learned from him, or whether an inborn  national peculiarity, I do not know. He went through great trials most  creditably, but he was no martyr. He constantly complained that his  teachings fell on listless ears, which made him sad and discouraged; but  he never flagged in his labors to improve his generation. He had no  egotism, but great self-respect, reminding us of Michael Angelo. He was  humble but full of dignity, serene though distressed, cheerful but not  hilarious. Were he to live among us now, we should call him a perfect  gentleman, with aristocratic sympathies, but more autocratic in his  views of government and society than aristocratic. He seems to have  loved the people, and was kind, even respectful, to everybody. When he  visited a school, it is said that he arose in quiet deference to speak  to the children, since some of the boys, he thought, would probably be  distinguished and powerful at no distant day. He was also remarkably  charitable, and put a greater value on virtues and abilities than upon  riches and honors. Though courted by princes he would not serve them in  violation of his self-respect, asked no favors, and returned their  presents. If he did not live above the world, he adorned the world. We  cannot compare his teachings with those of Christ; they are immeasurably  inferior in loftiness and spirituality; but they are worldly wise and  decorous, and are on an equality with those of Solomon in moral wisdom.  They are wonderfully adapted to a people who are conservative of their  institutions, and who have more respect for tradition than for progress.    The worship of ancestors is closely connected with veneration for  parental authority; and with absolute obedience to parents is allied  absolute obedience to the Emperor as head of the State. Hence, the  writings of Confucius have tended to cement the Chinese imperial  power,--in which fact we may perhaps find the secret of his  extraordinary posthumous influence. No wonder that emperors and rulers  have revered and honored his memory, and used the power of the State to  establish his doctrines. Moreover, his exaltation of learning as a  necessity for rulers has tended to put all the offices of the realm into  the hands of scholars. There never was a country where scholars have  been and still are so generally employed by Government. And as men of  learning are conservative in their sympathies, so they generally are  fond of peace and detest war. Hence, under the influence of scholars the  policy of the Chinese Government has always been mild and pacific. It is  even paternal. It has more similarity to the governments of a remote  antiquity than that of any existing nation. Thus is the influence of  Confucius seen in the stability of government and of conservative  institutions, as well as in decency in the affairs of life, and  gentleness and courtesy of manners. Above all is his influence seen in  the employment of men of learning and character in the affairs of state  and in all the offices of government, as the truest guardians of  whatever tends to exalt a State and make it respectable and stable, if  not powerful for war or daring in deeds of violence.    Confucius was essentially a statesman as well as a moralist; but his  political career was an apparent failure, since few princes listened to  his instructions. Yet if he was lost to his contemporaries, he has been  preserved by posterity. Perhaps there never lived a man so worshipped by  posterity who had so slight a following by the men of his own  time,--unless we liken him to that greatest of all Prophets, who, being  despised and rejected, is, and is to be, the \"headstone of the corner\"  in the rebuilding of humanity. Confucius says so little about the  subjects that interested the people of China that some suppose he had no  religion at all. Nor did he mention but once in his writings Shang-te,  the supreme deity of his remote ancestors; and he deduced nothing from  the worship of him. And yet there are expressions in his sayings which  seem to show that he believed in a supreme power. He often spoke of  Heaven, and loved to walk in the heavenly way. Heaven to him was  Destiny, by the power of which the world was created. By Heaven the  virtuous are rewarded, and the guilty are punished. Out of love for the  people, Heaven appoints rulers to protect and instruct them. Prayer is  unnecessary, because Heaven does not actively interfere with the soul  of man.    Confucius was philosophical and consistent in the all-pervading  principle by which he insisted upon the common source of power in  government,--of the State, of the family, and of one's self.  Self-knowledge and self-control he maintained to be the fountain of all  personal virtue and attainment in performance of the moral duties owed  to others, whether above or below in social standing. He supposed that  all men are born equally good, but that the temptations of the world at  length destroy the original rectitude. The \"superior man,\" who next to  the \"sage\" holds the highest place in the Confucian humanity, conquers  the evil in the world, though subject to infirmities; his acts are  guided by the laws of propriety, and are marked by strict sincerity.  Confucius admitted that he himself had failed to reach the level of the  superior man. This admission may have been the result of his  extraordinary humility and modesty.    In \"The Great Learning\" Confucius lays down the rules to enable one to  become a superior man. The foundation of his rules is in the  investigation of things, or _knowledge_, with which virtue is  indissolubly connected,--as in the ethics of Socrates. He maintained  that no attainment can be made, and no virtue can remain untainted,  without learning. \"Without this, benevolence becomes folly, sincerity  recklessness, straightforwardness rudeness, and firmness foolishness.\"  But mere accumulation of facts was not knowledge, for \"learning without  thought is labor lost; and thought without learning is perilous.\"  Complete wisdom was to be found only among the ancient sages; by no  mental endeavor could any man hope to equal the supreme wisdom of Yaou  and of Shun. The object of learning, he said, should be truth; and the  combination of learning with a firm will, will surely lead a man to  virtue. Virtue must be free from all hypocrisy and guile.    The next step towards perfection is the _cultivation of the  person_,--which must begin with introspection, and ends in harmonious  outward expression. Every man must guard his thoughts, words, and  actions; and conduct must agree with words. By words the superior man  directs others; but in order to do this his words must be sincere. It by  no means follows, however, that virtue is the invariable concomitant of  plausible speech.    The height of virtue is _filial piety_; for this is connected  indissolubly with loyalty to the sovereign, who is the father of his  people and the preserver of the State. Loyalty to the sovereign is  synonymous with duty, and is outwardly shown by obedience. Next to  parents, all superiors should be the object of reverence. This  reverence, it is true, should be reciprocal; a sovereign forfeits all  right to reverence and obedience when he ceases to be a minister of  good. But then, only the man who has developed virtues in himself is  considered competent to rule a family or a State; for the same virtues  which enable a man to rule the one, will enable him to rule the other.  No man can teach others who cannot teach his own family. The greatest  stress, as we have seen, is laid by Confucius on filial piety, which  consists in obedience to authority,--in serving parents according to  propriety, that is, with the deepest affection, and the father of the  State with loyalty. But while it is incumbent on a son to obey the  wishes of his parents, it is also a part of his duty to remonstrate with  them should they act contrary to the rules of propriety. All  remonstrances, however, must be made humbly. Should these remonstrances  fail, the son must mourn in silence the obduracy of the parents. He  carried the obligations of filial piety so far as to teach that a son  should conceal the immorality of a father, forgetting the distinction of  right and wrong. Brotherly love is the sequel of filial piety. \"Happy,\"  says he, \"is the union with wife and children; it is like the music of  lutes and harps. The love which binds brother to brother is second only  to that which is due from children to parents. It consists in mutual  friendship, joyful harmony, and dutiful obedience on the part of the  younger to the elder brothers.\"    While obedience is exacted to an elder brother and to parents, Confucius  said but little respecting the ties which should bind husband and wife.  He had but little respect for woman, and was divorced from his wife  after living with her for a year. He looked on women as every way  inferior to men, and only to be endured as necessary evils. It was not  until a woman became a mother, that she was treated with respect in  China. Hence, according to Confucius, the great object of marriage is to  increase the family, especially to give birth to sons. Women could be  lawfully and properly divorced who had no children,--which put women  completely in the power of men, and reduced them to the condition of  slaves. The failure to recognize the sanctity of marriage is the great  blot on the system of Confucius as a scheme of morals.    But the sage exalts friendship. Everybody, from the Emperor downward,  must have friends; and the best friends are those allied by ties of  blood. \"Friends,\" said he, \"are wealth to the poor, strength to the  weak, and medicine to the sick.\" One of the strongest bonds"]]]
