These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are yet a  natural basis of self-confidence.    My far-reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known  to have retained their self-consciousness without interruption by  the dramatic transition to and from \"life\" and \"death.\" If man be  solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity.  But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, man is  essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of human  egoity is only temporarily allied with sense perception.    Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During  travels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections  from the lips of veracious men and women.    I was born in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and passed  my first eight years at Gorakhpur. This was my birthplace in the  United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four  boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh {FN1-4}, was the second  son and the fourth child.    Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the KSHATRIYA caste. {FN1-5} Both  were blessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and  dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental  harmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young  lives.    Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind, grave, at times stern.  Loving him dearly, we children yet observed a certain reverential  distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guided  principally by his intellect. But Mother was a queen of hearts,  and taught us only through love. After her death, Father displayed  more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often  metamorphosed into my mother's.    In Mother's presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance  with the scriptures. Tales from the MAHABHARATA and RAMAYANA {FN1-6}  were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline.  Instruction and chastisement went hand in hand.    A daily gesture of respect to Father was given by Mother's dressing us  carefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office.  His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the  Bengal-Nagpur Railway, one of India's large companies. His work  involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during  my childhood.    Mother held an open hand toward the needy. Father was also kindly  disposed, but his respect for law and order extended to the budget.  One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's  monthly income.    \"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable  limit.\" Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother.  She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any  disagreement.    \"Good-by; I am going away to my mother's home.\" Ancient ultimatum!    We broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived  opportunely; he whispered to Father some sage counsel, garnered  no doubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory  remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble  I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic  discussion.    \"Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived  at the house.\" Mother's smile had its own persuasion.    \"Why ten rupees? One is enough.\" Father added a justification: \"When  my father and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of  poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was  a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that  I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per month. He  declined, remarking that even a rupee is important.\"    \"How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!\" Mother's heart  had an instant logic. \"Do you want this woman also to remember  painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?\"    \"You win!\" With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he  opened his wallet. \"Here is a ten-rupee note. Give it to her with  my good will.\"    Father tended to first say \"No\" to any new proposal. His attitude  toward the strange woman who so readily enlisted Mother's sympathy  was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant  acceptance--typical of the French mind in the West-is really only  honoring the principle of \"due reflection.\" I always found Father  reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I could bolster  up my numerous requests with one or two good arguments, he invariably  put the coveted goal within my reach, whether it were a vacation  trip or a new motorcycle.    Father was a strict disciplinarian to his children in their early  years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Spartan. He  never visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation  in various spiritual practices and in reading the BHAGAVAD GITA.  {FN1-7} Shunning all luxuries, he would cling to one old pair of  shoes until they were useless. His sons bought automobiles after  they came into popular use, but Father was always content with the  trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of  money for the sake of power was alien to his nature. Once, after  organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself  by holding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a  civic duty in his spare time.    Several years after Father had retired on a pension, an English  accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway  Company. The amazed investigator discovered that Father had never  applied for overdue bonuses.    \"He did the work of three men!\" the accountant told the company.  \"He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.) owing to him as back  compensation.\" The officials presented Father with a check for  this amount. He thought so little about it that he overlooked any  mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest  brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement.    \"Why be elated by material profit?\" Father replied. \"The one who  pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain  nor depressed by loss. He knows that man arrives penniless in this  world, and departs without a single rupee.\"    [Illustration: MY FATHER, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, A Disciple of  Lahiri Mahasaya--see father1.jpg]    Early in their married life, my parents became disciples of a  great master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This contact strengthened  Father's naturally ascetical temperament. Mother made a remarkable  admission to my eldest sister Roma: \"Your father and myself live  together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having  children.\"    Father first met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, {FN1-8}  an employee in the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.  Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian  saints.  He invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior  glories of his own guru.    \"Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which  your father became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?\"    It was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat together  in the compound of my home, that he put this intriguing question.  I shook my head with a smile of anticipation.    \"Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your  father-to give me a week's leave from my Gorakhpur duties in order  to visit my guru in Benares. Your father ridiculed my plan.    \"'Are you going to become a religious fanatic?' he inquired.  'Concentrate on your office work if you want to forge ahead.'    \"Sadly walking home along a woodland path that day, I met your  father in a palanquin. He dismissed his servants and conveyance,  and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed  out the advantages of striving for worldly success. But I heard  him listlessly. My heart was repeating: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot  live without seeing you!'    \"Our path took us to the edge of a tranquil field, where the rays  of the late afternoon sun were still crowning the tall ripple of  the wild grass. We paused in admiration. There in the field, only  a few yards from us, the form of my great guru suddenly appeared!  {FN1-9}    \"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was  resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished as mysteriously as he  had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri  Mahasaya!' Your father was motionless with stupefaction for a few  moments.    \"'Abinash, not only do I give YOU leave, but I give MYSELF leave to  start for Benares tomorrow. I must know this great Lahiri Mahasaya,  who is able to materialize himself at will in order to intercede  for you! I will take my wife and ask this master to initiate us in  his spiritual path. Will you guide us to him?'    \"'Of course.' Joy filled me at the miraculous answer to my prayer,  and the quick, favorable turn of events.    \"The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We  took a horse cart the following day, and then had to walk through  narrow lanes to my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor,  we bowed before the master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture.  He blinked his piercing eyes and leveled them on your father.    \"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His words were the  same as those he had used two days before in the Gorakhpur field.  He added, 'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me,  and that you and your wife have accompanied him.'    \"To their joy, he initiated your parents in the spiritual practice  of KRIYA YOGA. {FN1-10} Your father and I, as brother disciples,  have been close friends since the memorable day of the vision.  Lahiri Mahasaya took a definite interest in your own birth.

Henry courted them assiduously.    It had not been hard to scrape acquaintance with them. The principals  of the company always put up at the best hotel, and--his expenses being  paid by his employer--so did Henry. It was the easiest thing possible  to bridge with a well-timed whisky-and-soda the gulf between  non-acquaintance and warm friendship. Walter Jelliffe, in particular,  was peculiarly accessible. Every time Henry accosted him--as a  different individual, of course--and renewed in a fresh disguise the  friendship which he had enjoyed at the last town, Walter Jelliffe met  him more than half-way.    It was in the sixth week of the tour that the comedian, promoting him  from mere casual acquaintanceship, invited him to come up to his room  and smoke a cigar.    Henry was pleased and flattered. Jelliffe was a personage, always  surrounded by admirers, and the compliment was consequently of a high  order.    He lit his cigar. Among his friends at the Green-Room Club it was  unanimously held that Walter Jelliffe's cigars brought him within the  scope of the law forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons; but  Henry would have smoked the gift of such a man if it had been a  cabbage-leaf. He puffed away contentedly. He was made up as an old  Indian colonel that week, and he complimented his host on the aroma  with a fine old-world courtesy.    Walter Jelliffe seemed gratified.    'Quite comfortable?' he asked.    'Quite, I thank you,' said Henry, fondling his silver moustache.    'That's right. And now tell me, old man, which of us is it you're  trailing?'    Henry nearly swallowed his cigar.    'What do you mean?'    'Oh, come,' protested Jelliffe; 'there's no need to keep it up with me.  I know you're a detective. The question is, Who's the man you're after?  That's what we've all been wondering all this time.'    All! They had all been wondering! It was worse than Henry could have  imagined. Till now he had pictured his position with regard to 'The  Girl From Brighton' company rather as that of some scientist who,  seeing but unseen, keeps a watchful eye on the denizens of a drop of  water under his microscope. And they had all detected him--every one of  them.    It was a stunning blow. If there was one thing on which Henry prided  himself it was the impenetrability of his disguises. He might be slow;  he might be on the stupid side; but he could disguise himself. He had a  variety of disguises, each designed to befog the public more hopelessly  than the last.    Going down the street, you would meet a typical commercial traveller,  dapper and alert. Anon, you encountered a heavily bearded Australian.  Later, maybe, it was a courteous old retired colonel who stopped you  and inquired the way to Trafalgar Square. Still later, a rather flashy  individual of the sporting type asked you for a match for his cigar.  Would you have suspected for one instant that each of these widely  differing personalities was in reality one man?    Certainly you would.    Henry did not know it, but he had achieved in the eyes of the small  servant who answered the front-door bell at his boarding-house a  well-established reputation as a humorist of the more practical kind.  It was his habit to try his disguises on her. He would ring the bell,  inquire for the landlady, and when Bella had gone, leap up the stairs  to his room. Here he would remove the disguise, resume his normal  appearance, and come downstairs again, humming a careless air. Bella,  meanwhile, in the kitchen, would be confiding to her ally the cook that  'Mr Rice had jest come in, lookin' sort o' funny again'.    He sat and gaped at Walter Jelliffe. The comedian regarded him  curiously.    'You look at least a hundred years old,' he said. 'What are you made up  as? A piece of Gorgonzola?'    Henry glanced hastily at the mirror. Yes, he did look rather old. He  must have overdone some of the lines on his forehead. He looked  something between a youngish centenarian and a nonagenarian who had  seen a good deal of trouble.    'If you knew how you were demoralizing the company,' Jelliffe went on,  'you would drop it. As steady and quiet a lot of boys as ever you met  till you came along. Now they do nothing but bet on what disguise  you're going to choose for the next town. I don't see why you need to  change so often. You were all right as the Scotchman at Bristol. We  were all saying how nice you looked. You should have stuck to that. But  what do you do at Hull but roll in in a scrubby moustache and a tweed  suit, looking rotten. However, all that is beside the point. It's a  free country. If you like to spoil your beauty, I suppose there's no  law against it. What I want to know is, who's the man? Whose track are  you sniffing on, Bill? You'll pardon my calling you Bill. You're known  as Bill the Bloodhound in the company. Who's the man?'    'Never mind,' said Henry.    He was aware, as he made it, that it was not a very able retort, but he  was feeling too limp for satisfactory repartee. Criticisms in the  Bureau, dealing with his alleged solidity of skull, he did not resent.  He attributed them to man's natural desire to chaff his fellow-man. But  to be unmasked by the general public in this way was another matter. It  struck at the root of all things.    'But I do mind,' objected Jelliffe. 'It's most important. A lot of  money hangs on it. We've got a sweepstake on in the company, the holder  of the winning name to take the entire receipts. Come on. Who is he?'    Henry rose and made for the door. His feelings were too deep for words.  Even a minor detective has his professional pride; and the knowledge  that his espionage is being made the basis of sweepstakes by his quarry  cuts this to the quick.    'Here, don't go! Where are you going?'    'Back to London,' said Henry, bitterly. 'It's a lot of good my staying  here now, isn't it?'    'I should say it was--to me. Don't be in a hurry. You're thinking that,  now we know all about you, your utility as a sleuth has waned to some  extent. Is that it?'    'Well?'    'Well, why worry? What does it matter to you? You don't get paid by  results, do you? Your boss said \"Trail along.\" Well, do it, then. I  should hate to lose you. I don't suppose you know it, but you've been  the best mascot this tour that I've ever come across. Right from the  start we've been playing to enormous business. I'd rather kill a black  cat than lose you. Drop the disguises, and stay with us. Come behind  all you want, and be sociable.'    A detective is only human. The less of a detective, the more human he  is. Henry was not much of a detective, and his human traits were  consequently highly developed. From a boy, he had never been able to  resist curiosity. If a crowd collected in the street he always added  himself to it, and he would have stopped to gape at a window with  'Watch this window' written on it, if he had been running for his life  from wild bulls. He was, and always had been, intensely desirous of  some day penetrating behind the scenes of a theatre.    And there was another thing. At last, if he accepted this invitation,  he would be able to see and speak to Alice Weston, and interfere with  the manoeuvres of the hatchet-faced man, on whom he had brooded with  suspicion and jealousy since that first morning at the station. To see  Alice! Perhaps, with eloquence, to talk her out of that ridiculous  resolve of hers!    'Why, there's something in that,' he said.    'Rather! Well, that's settled. And now, touching that sweep, who  _is_ it?'    'I can't tell you that. You see, so far as that goes, I'm just where I  was before. I can still watch--whoever it is I'm watching.'    'Dash it, so you can. I didn't think of that,' said Jelliffe, who  possessed a sensitive conscience. 'Purely between ourselves, it isn't  _me_, is it?'    Henry eyed him inscrutably. He could look inscrutable at times.    'Ah!' he said, and left quickly, with the feeling that, however poorly  he had shown up during the actual interview, his exit had been good. He  might have been a failure in the matter of disguise, but nobody could  have put more quiet sinister-ness into that 'Ah!' It did much to soothe  him and ensure a peaceful night's rest.    On the following night, for the first time in his life, Henry found  himself behind the scenes of a theatre, and instantly began to  experience all the complex emotions which come to the layman in that  situation. That is to say, he felt like a cat which has strayed into a  strange hostile back-yard. He was in a new world, inhabited by weird  creatures, who flitted about in an eerie semi-darkness, like brightly  coloured animals in a cavern.    'The Girl From Brighton' was one of those exotic productions specially  designed for the Tired Business Man. It relied for a large measure of  its success on the size and appearance of its chorus, and on their  constant change of costume. Henry, as a consequence, was the centre of  a kaleidoscopic whirl of feminine loveliness, dressed to represent  such varying flora and fauna as rabbits, Parisian students, colleens,  Dutch peasants, and daffodils. Musical comedy is the Irish stew of the  drama. Anything may be put into it, with the certainty that it will  improve the general effect.    He scanned the throng for a sight of Alice. Often as he had seen the  piece in the course of its six weeks' wandering in the wilderness he  had never succeeded in recognizing her from the front of the house.  Quite possibly, he thought, she might be on the stage already, hidden  in a rose-tree or some other shrub, ready at the signal to burst forth  upon the audience in short skirts; for in 'The Girl From Brighton'  almost anything could turn suddenly into a chorus-girl.    Then he saw her, among the daffodils. She was not a particularly  convincing daffodil, but she looked good to Henry. With wabbling"]]]
