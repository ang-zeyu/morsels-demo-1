If he is to come  to the front it must be in the day of battle. Then, possibly, one  chief may rise so high above his fellows that all may recognize  his merits and agree to follow him.\"    \"That is so,\" Beric agreed; \"but is it possible that even the greatest  hero should find support from all? Cassivelaunus was betrayed by  the Trinobantes. Who could have united the tribes more than the  sons of Cunobeline, who reigned over well nigh all Britain, and  who was a great king ruling wisely and well, and doing all in his  power to raise and advance the people; and yet, when the hour came,  the kingdom broke up into pieces. Veric, the chief of the Cantii,  went to Rome and invited the invader to aid him against his rivals  at home, and not a man of the Iceni or the Brigantes marched to  the aid of Caractacus and Togodamnus. What wonder, then, that these  were defeated. Worse than all, when Caractacus was driven a fugitive  to hide among the Brigantes, did not their queen, Cartismandua,  hand him over to the Romans? Where can we hope to find a leader  more fitted to unite us than was Caractacus, the son of the king  whom we all, at least, recognized and paid tribute to; a prince  who had learned wisdom from a wise father, a warrior enterprising,  bold, and indomitable--a true patriot?    \"If Caractacus could not unite us, what hope is there of finding  another who would do so? Moreover, our position is far worse now  than it was ten years ago. The Belgae and Dumnonii in the southwest  have been crushed after thirty battles; the Dobuni in the centre  have been defeated and garrisoned; the Silures have set an example  to us all, inflicting many defeats on the Romans; but their power  has at last been broken. The Brigantes and ourselves have both been  heavily struck, as we deserved, Boduoc, for standing aloof from  Caractacus at first. Thus the task of shaking off the Roman bonds  is far more difficult now than it was when Plautius landed here  twenty years ago. Well, it is time for me to be going on. Won't  you come with me, Boduoc?\"    \"Not I, Beric; I never want to enter their town again save with a  sword in one hand and a torch in the other. It enrages me to see  the airs of superiority they give themselves. They scarce seem even  to see us as we walk in their streets; and as to the soldiers as  they stride along with helmet and shield, my fingers itch to meet  them in the forest. No; I promised to walk so far with you, but I  go no farther. How long will you be there?\"    \"Two hours at most, I should say.\"    \"The sun is halfway down, Beric; I will wait for you till it touches  that hill over there. Till then you will find me sitting by the  first tree at the spot where we left the forest.\"    Beric nodded and walked on towards the town. The lad, for he was  not yet sixteen, was the son of Parta, the chieftainess of one of  the divisions of the great tribe of the Iceni, who occupied the  tract of country now known as Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, and  Huntingdon. This tribe had yielded but a nominal allegiance to  Cunobeline, and had held aloof during the struggle between Caractacus  and the Romans, but when the latter had attempted to establish  forts in their country they had taken up arms. Ostorius Scapula,  the Roman proprietor, had marched against them and defeated them  with great slaughter, and they had submitted to the Roman authority.  The Sarci, the division of the tribe to which Beric belonged, had  taken a leading part in the rising, and his father had fallen in  the defence of their intrenchments.    Among the British tribes the women ranked with the men, and even  when married the wife was often the acknowledged chief of the  tribe. Parta had held an equal authority with her husband, and at  his death remained sole head of the subtribe, and in order to ensure  its obedience in the future, Ostorius had insisted that her only  son Beric, at that time a boy of eleven, should be handed over to  them as a hostage.    Had Parta consulted her own wishes she would have retired with a  few followers to the swamps and fens of the country to the north  rather than surrender her son, but the Brigantes, who inhabited  Lincolnshire, and who ranged over the whole of the north of Britain  as far as Northumberland, had also received a defeat at the hands  of the Romans, and might not improbably hand her over upon their  demand. She therefore resigned herself to let Beric go.    \"My son,\" she said, \"I need not tell you not to let them Romanize  you. You have been brought up to hate them. Your father has fallen  before their weapons, half your tribe have been slain, your country  lies under their feet. I will not wrong you then by fearing for a  moment that they can make a Roman of you.    \"You have been brought up to lie upon the bare ground, to  suffer fatigue and hardship, hunger and thirst, and the rich food  and splendid houses and soft raiment of the Romans should have no  attraction for you. I know not how long your imprisonment among them  may last. For the present I have little hope of another rising; but  should I see a prospect of anything like unity among our people, I  will send Boduoc with a message to you to hold yourself in readiness  to escape when you receive the signal that the time has come. Till  then employ your mind in gaining what good you may by your residence  among them; there must be some advantage in their methods of warfare  which has enabled the people of one city to conquer the world.    \"It is not their strength, for they are but pigmies to us. We stand  a full head above them, and even we women are stronger than Roman  soldiers, and yet they defeat us. Learn then their language, throw  your whole mind into that at first, then study their military  discipline and their laws. It must be the last as much as their  discipline that has made them rulers over so vast an empire. Find  out if you can the secret of their rule, and study the training by  which their soldiers move and fight as if bound together by a cord,  forming massive walls against which we break ourselves in vain.  Heed not their arts, pay no attention to their luxuries, these did  Cunobeline no good, and did not for a day delay the destruction  that fell upon his kingdom. What we need is first a knowledge of  their military tactics, so that we may drive them from the land;  secondly, a knowledge of their laws, that we may rule ourselves  wisely after they have gone. What there is good in the rest may  come in time.    \"However kind they may be to you, bear always in mind that you  are but a prisoner among the oppressors of your country, and that  though, for reasons of policy, they may treat you well, yet that  they mercilessly despoil and ill treat your countrymen. Remember  too, Beric, that the Britons, now that Caractacus has been sent  a prisoner to Rome, need a leader, one who is not only brave and  valiant in the fight, but who can teach the people how to march to  victory, and can order and rule them well afterwards. We are part  of one of our greatest tribes, and from among us, if anywhere, such  a leader should come.    \"I have great hopes of you, Beric. I know that you are brave, for  single handed you slew with an arrow a great wolf the other day;  but bravery is common to all, I do not think that there is a coward  in the tribe. I believe you are intelligent. I consulted the old  Druid in the forest last week, and he prophesied a high destiny  for you; and when the messenger brought the Roman summons for me  to deliver you up as a hostage, it seemed to me that this was of  all things the one that would fit you best for future rule. I am  not ambitious for you, Beric. It would be nought to me if you were  king of all the Britons. It is of our country that I think. We  need a great leader, and my prayer to the gods is that one may be  found. If you should be the man so much the better; but if not,  let it be another. Comport yourself among them independently, as  one who will some day be chief of a British tribe, but be not sullen  or obstinate. Mix freely with them, learn their language, gather  what are the laws under which they live, see how they build those  wonderful houses of theirs, watch the soldiers at their exercises,  so that when you return among us you can train the Sarci to fight  in a similar manner. Keep the one purpose always in your mind.  Exercise your muscles daily, for among us no man can lead who is  not as strong and as brave as the best who follow him. Bear yourself  so that you shall be in good favour with all men.\"    Beric had, to the best of his power, carried out the instructions  of his mother. It was the object of the Romans always to win over  their adversaries if possible, and the boy had no reason to complain  of his treatment. He was placed in the charge of Caius Muro,  commander of a legion, and a slave was at once appointed to teach  him Latin. He took his meals with the scribe and steward of the  household, for Caius was of noble family, of considerable wealth,  and his house was one of the finest in Camalodunum. He was a kindly  and just man, and much beloved by his troops. As soon as Beric had  learned the language, Caius ordered the scribe to teach him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#2)"],[1," uncommonly snug little place, too,\" he said. \"Now, if you will  forgive me for talking business, you, I gather, propose making some  stay in this country.\"    The prince laughed shortly. So did his aide-de-camp. \"Exactly,\"  continued Mr. Chugwater, \"exactly. Then you will want some  _pied-a-terre_, if you follow me. I shall be delighted to let you  this house on remarkably easy terms for as long as you please. Just  come along into my study for a moment. We can talk it over quietly  there. You see, dealing direct with me, you would escape the  middleman's charges, and--\"    Gently but firmly he edged the prince out of the room and down the  passage.    The aide-de-camp continued to sit staring woodenly at the carpet.  Reggie closed quietly in on him.    \"Excuse me,\" he said; \"talking shop and all that. But I'm an agent for  the Come One Come All Accident and Life Assurance Office. You have  heard of it probably? We can offer you really exceptional terms. You  must not miss a chance of this sort. Now here's a prospectus--\"    Horace sidled forward.    \"I don't know if you happen to be a cyclist, Captain--er--Graf; but if  you'd like a practically new motorbike, only been used since last  November, I can let you--\"    There was a swish of skirts as Grace and Alice advanced on the visitor.    \"I'm sure,\" said Grace winningly, \"that you're fond of the theatre,  Captain Poppenheim. We are getting up a performance of 'Ici on parle  Francais,' in aid of the fund for Supplying Square Meals to Old-Age  Pensioners. Such a deserving object, you know. Now, how many tickets  will you take?\"    \"You can sell them to your friends, you know,\" added Mrs. Chugwater.    The aide-de-camp gulped convulsively.           *       *       *       *       *    Ten minutes later two penniless men groped their way, dazed, to the  garden gate.    \"At last,\" said Prince Otto brokenly, for it was he, \"at last I begin  to realise the horrors of an invasion--for the invaders.\"    And together the two men staggered on.          Chapter 3    ENGLAND'S PERIL      When the papers arrived next morning, it was seen that the situation  was even worse than had at first been suspected. Not only had the  Germans effected a landing in Essex, but, in addition, no fewer than  eight other hostile armies had, by some remarkable coincidence, hit on  that identical moment for launching their long-prepared blow.    England was not merely beneath the heel of the invader. It was beneath  the heels of nine invaders.    There was barely standing-room.    Full details were given in the Press. It seemed that while Germany was  landing in Essex, a strong force of Russians, under the Grand Duke  Vodkakoff, had occupied Yarmouth. Simultaneously the Mad Mullah had  captured Portsmouth; while the Swiss navy had bombarded Lyme Regis, and  landed troops immediately to westward of the bathing-machines. At  precisely the same moment China, at last awakened, had swooped down  upon that picturesque little Welsh watering-place, Lllgxtplll, and,  despite desperate resistance on the part of an excursion of Evanses and  Joneses from Cardiff, had obtained a secure foothold. While these  things were happening in Wales, the army of Monaco had descended on  Auchtermuchty, on the Firth of Clyde. Within two minutes of this  disaster, by Greenwich time, a boisterous band of Young Turks had  seized Scarborough. And, at Brighton and Margate respectively, small  but determined armies, the one of Moroccan brigands, under Raisuli, the  other of dark-skinned warriors from the distant isle of Bollygolla, had  made good their footing.    This was a very serious state of things.    Correspondents of the _Daily Mail_ at the various points of attack  had wired such particulars as they were able. The preliminary parley at  Lllgxtplll between Prince Ping Pong Pang, the Chinese general, and  Llewellyn Evans, the leader of the Cardiff excursionists, seems to have  been impressive to a degree. The former had spoken throughout in pure  Chinese, the latter replying in rich Welsh, and the general effect,  wired the correspondent, was almost painfully exhilarating.    So sudden had been the attacks that in very few instances was there any  real resistance. The nearest approach to it appears to have been seen  at Margate.    At the time of the arrival of the black warriors which, like the other  onslaughts, took place between one and two o'clock on the afternoon of  August Bank Holiday, the sands were covered with happy revellers. When  the war canoes approached the beach, the excursionists seem to have  mistaken their occupants at first for a troupe of nigger minstrels on  an unusually magnificent scale; and it was freely noised abroad in the  crowd that they were being presented by Charles Frohmann, who was  endeavouring to revive the ancient glories of the Christy Minstrels.  Too soon, however, it was perceived that these were no harmless Moore  and Burgesses. Suspicion was aroused by the absence of banjoes and  tambourines; and when the foremost of the negroes dexterously scalped a  small boy, suspicion became certainty.    In this crisis the trippers of Margate behaved well. The Mounted  Infantry, on donkeys, headed by Uncle Bones, did much execution. The  Ladies' Tormentor Brigade harassed the enemy's flank, and a  hastily-formed band of sharp-shooters, armed with three-shies-a-penny  balls and milky cocos, undoubtedly troubled the advance guard  considerably. But superior force told. After half an hour's fighting  the excursionists fled, leaving the beach to the foe.    At Auchtermuchty and Portsmouth no obstacle, apparently, was offered to  the invaders. At Brighton the enemy were permitted to land unharmed.  Scarborough, taken utterly aback by the boyish vigour of the Young  Turks, was an easy prey; and at Yarmouth, though the Grand Duke  received a nasty slap in the face from a dexterously-thrown bloater,  the resistance appears to have been equally futile.    By tea-time on August the First, nine strongly-equipped forces were  firmly established on British soil.          Chapter 4    WHAT ENGLAND THOUGHT OF IT      Such a state of affairs, disturbing enough in itself, was rendered  still more disquieting by the fact that, except for the Boy Scouts,  England's military strength at this time was practically nil.    The abolition of the regular army had been the first step. Several  causes had contributed to this. In the first place, the Socialists had  condemned the army system as unsocial. Privates, they pointed out, were  forbidden to hob-nob with colonels, though the difference in their  positions was due to a mere accident of birth. They demanded that every  man in the army should be a general. Comrade Quelch, in an eloquent  speech at Newington Butts, had pointed, amidst enthusiasm, to the  republics of South America, where the system worked admirably.    Scotland, too, disapproved of the army, because it was professional.  Mr. Smith wrote several trenchant letters to Mr. C. J. B. Marriott on  the subject.    So the army was abolished, and the land defence of the country  entrusted entirely to the Territorials, the Legion of Frontiersmen, and  the Boy Scouts.    But first the Territorials dropped out. The strain of being referred to  on the music-hall stage as Teddy-boys was too much for them.    Then the Frontiersmen were disbanded. They had promised well at the  start, but they had never been themselves since La Milo had been  attacked by the Manchester Watch Committee. It had taken all the heart  out of them.    So that in the end England's defenders were narrowed down to the  Boy Scouts, of whom Clarence Chugwater was the pride, and a large  civilian population, prepared, at any moment, to turn out for their  country's sake and wave flags. A certain section of these, too, could  sing patriotic songs.           *       *       *       *       *    It was inevitable, in the height of the Silly Season, that such a topic  as the simultaneous invasion of Great Britain by nine foreign powers  should be seized upon by the press. Countless letters poured into the  offices of the London daily papers every morning. Space forbids more  than the gist of a few of these.    Miss Charlesworth wrote:--\"In this crisis I see no alternative. I shall  disappear.\"    Mr. Horatio Bottomley, in _John Bull_, said that there was some  very dirty and underhand work going on, and that the secret history of  the invasion would be published shortly. He himself, however, preferred  any invader, even the King of Bollygolla, to some K.C.'s he could name,  though he was fond of dear old Muir. He wanted to know why Inspector  Drew had retired.    The _Daily Express_, in a thoughtful leader, said that Free Trade  evidently meant invaders for all.    Mr. Herbert Gladstone, writing to the _Times_, pointed out that he  had let so many undesirable aliens into the country that he did not see  that a few more made much difference.    Mr. George R. Sims made eighteen puns on the names of the invading  generals in the course of one number of \"Mustard and Cress.\"    Mr. H. G. Pelissier urged the public to look on the bright side. There  was a sun still shining in the sky. Besides, who knew that some foreign  marksman might not pot the censor?    Mr. Robert FitzSimmons offered to take on any of the invading generals,  or all of them, and if he didn't beat them it would only be because the  referee had a wife and seven small children and had asked him as a  personal favour to let himself be knocked out. He had lost several  fights that way.    The directors of the Crystal Palace wrote a circular letter to the  shareholders, pointing out that there was a good time coming. With this  addition to the public, the Palace stood a sporting chance of once more  finding itself full.    Judge Willis asked: \"What is an invasion?\"    Signor Scotti cabled anxiously from America (prepaid): \"Stands Scotland  where it did?\"    Mr. Lewis Waller"]]]
