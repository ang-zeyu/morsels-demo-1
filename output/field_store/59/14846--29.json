SCHILLER.  EASTER FAIR, 1781.          ADVERTISEMENT TO THE ROBBERS.    AS COMMUNICATED BY SCHILLER TO DALBERG IN 1781, AND SUPPOSED TO HAVE  BEEN USED AS A PROLOGUE.    --This has never before been printed with any of the editions.--    The picture of a great, misguided soul, endowed with every gift of  excellence; yet lost in spite of all its gifts! Unbridled passions and  bad companionship corrupt his heart, urge him on from crime to crime,  until at last he stands at the head of a band of murderers, heaps horror  upon horror, and plunges from precipice to precipice into the lowest  depths of despair. Great and majestic in misfortune, by misfortune  reclaimed, and led back to the paths of virtue. Such a man shall you  pity and hate, abhor yet love, in the Robber Moor. You will likewise  see a juggling, fiendish knave unmasked and blown to atoms in his own  mines; a fond, weak, and over-indulgent father; the sorrows of too  enthusiastic love, and the tortures of ungoverned passion. Here, too,  you will witness, not without a shudder, the interior economy of vice;  and from the stage be taught how all the tinsel of fortune fails to  smother the inward worm; and how terror, anguish, remorse, and despair  tread close on the footsteps of guilt. Let the spectator weep to-day at  our exhibition, and tremble, and learn to bend his passions to the laws  of religion and reason; let the youth behold with alarm the consequences  of unbridled excess; nor let the man depart without imbibing the lesson  that the invisible hand of Providence makes even villains the  instruments of its designs and judgments, and can marvellously unravel  the most intricate perplexities of fate.          PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.    The eight hundred copies of the first edition of my ROBBERS were  exhausted before all the admirers of the piece were supplied. A second  was therefore undertaken, which has been improved by greater care in  printing, and by the omission of those equivocal sentences which were  offensive to the more fastidious part of the public. Such an  alteration, however, in the construction of the play as should satisfy  all the wishes of my friends and critics has not been my object.    In this second edition the several songs have been arranged for the  pianoforte, which will enhance its value to the musical part of the  public. I am indebted for this to an able composer,* who has performed  his task in so masterly a manner that the hearer is not unlikely to  forget the poet in the melody of the musician.

Apartment in the Castle of COUNT MOOR.                  FRANCIS, OLD MOOR.      FRANCIS. But are you really well, father? You look so pale.    OLD MOOR. Quite well, my son--what have you to tell me?    FRANCIS. The post is arrived--a letter from our correspondent at  Leipsic.    OLD M. (eagerly). Any tidings of my son Charles?    FRANCIS. Hem! Hem!--Why, yes. But I fear--I know not--whether I dare  --your health.--Are you really quite well, father?    OLD M. As a fish in water.* Does he write of my son? What means this  anxiety about my health? You have asked me that question twice.       [*This is equivalent to our English saying \"As sound as a roach.\"]    FRANCIS. If you are unwell--or are the least apprehensive of being so--  permit me to defer--I will speak to you at a fitter season.--(Half  aside.) These are no tidings for a feeble frame.    OLD M. Gracious Heavens? what am I doomed to hear?    FRANCIS. First let me retire and shed a tear of compassion for my lost  brother. Would that my lips might be forever sealed--for he is your  son! Would that I could throw an eternal veil over his shame--for he is  my brother! But to obey you is my first, though painful, duty--forgive  me, therefore.    OLD M. Oh, Charles! Charles! Didst thou but know what thorns thou  plantest in thy father's bosom! That one gladdening report of thee would  add ten years to my life! yes, bring back my youth! whilst now, alas,  each fresh intelligence but hurries me a step nearer to the grave!    FRANCIS. Is it so, old man, then farewell! for even this very day we  might all have to tear our hair over your coffin.*       [* This idiom is very common in Germany, and is used to express     affliction.]    OLD M. Stay! There remains but one short step more--let him have his  will! (He sits down.) The sins of the father shall be visited unto the  third and fourth generation--let him fulfil the decree.    FRANCIS (takes the letter out of his pocket). You know our  correspondent! See! I would give a finger of my right hand might I  pronounce him a liar--a base and slanderous liar! Compose yourself!  Forgive me if I do not let you read the letter yourself. You cannot,  must not, yet know all.    OLD M. All, all, my son. You will but spare me crutches.*       [* _Du ersparst mir die Krucke_; meaning that the contents of the     letter can but shorten his declining years, and so spare him the     necessity of crutches.]    FRANCIS (reads). \"Leipsic, May 1. Were I not bound by an inviolable  promise to conceal nothing from you, not even the smallest particular,  that I am able to collect, respecting your brother's career, never, my  dearest friend, should my guiltless pen become an instrument of torture  to you. I can gather from a hundred of your letters how tidings such as  these must pierce your fraternal heart. It seems to me as though I saw  thee, for the sake of this worthless, this detestable\"--(OLD M. covers  his face). Oh! my father, I am only reading you the mildest passages--  \"this detestable man, shedding a thousand tears.\" Alas! mine flowed--ay,  gushed in torrents over these pitying cheeks. \"I already picture to  myself your aged pious father, pale as death.\" Good Heavens! and so you  are, before you have heard anything.    OLD M. Go on! Go on!    FRANCIS. \"Pale as death, sinking down on his chair, and cursing the day  when his ear was first greeted with the lisping cry of 'Father!' I have  not yet been able to discover all, and of the little I do know I dare  tell you only a part. Your brother now seems to have filled up the  measure of his infamy. I, at least, can imagine nothing beyond what he  has already accomplished; but possibly his genius may soar above my  conceptions. After having contracted debts to the amount of forty  thousand ducats, \"--a good round sum for pocket-money, father\" and having  dishonored the daughter of a rich banker, whose affianced lover, a  gallant youth of rank, he mortally wounded in a duel, he yesterday, in  the dead of night, took the desperate resolution of absconding from the  arm of justice, with seven companions whom he had corrupted to his own  vicious courses.\" Father? for heaven's sake, father! How do you feel?    OLD M. Enough. No more, my son, no more!    FRANCIS. I will spare your feelings. \"The injured cry aloud for  satisfaction. Warrants have been issued for his apprehension--a price  is set on his head--the name of Moor\"--No, these unhappy lips shall not  be guilty of a father's murder (he tears the letter). Believe it not,  my father, believe not a syllable.    OLD M. (weeps bitterly). My name--my unsullied name!    FRANCIS (throws himself on his neck). Infamous! most infamous Charles!  Oh, had I not my forebodings, when, even as a boy, he would scamper  after the girls, and ramble about over hill and common with ragamuffin  boys and all the vilest rabble; when he shunned the very sight of a  church as a malefactor shuns a gaol, and would throw the pence he had  wrung from your bounty into the hat of the first beggar he met, whilst  we at home were edifying ourselves with devout prayers and pious  homilies? Had I not my misgivings when he gave himself up to reading  the adventures of Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and other  benighted heathens, in preference to the history of the penitent Tobias?  A hundred times over have I warned you--for my brotherly affection was  ever kept in subjection to filial duty--that this forward youth would  one day bring sorrow and disgrace on us all. Oh that he bore not the  name of Moor! that my heart beat less warmly for him! This sinful  affection, which I can not overcome, will one day rise up against me  before the judgment-seat of heaven.    OLD M. Oh! my prospects! my golden dreams!    FRANCIS. Ay, well I knew it. Exactly what I always feared. That fiery  spirit, you used to say, which is kindling in the boy, and renders him  so susceptible to impressions of the beautiful and grand--the  ingenuousness which reveals his whole soul in his eyes--the tenderness  of feeling which melts him into weeping sympathy at every tale of  sorrow--the manly courage which impels him to the summit of giant oaks,  and urges him over fosse and palisade and foaming torrents--that  youthful thirst of honor--that unconquerable resolution--all those  resplendent virtues which in the father's darling gave such promise--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],[0,"Wilhelm Tell (#2)"],[1,"ast.

A lime-tree in front of STAUFFACHER'S house at Steinen,     in Schwytz, upon the public road, near a bridge.       WERNER STAUFFACHER and PFEIFFER, of Lucerne, enter into     conversation.    PFEIFFER.  Ay, ay, friend Stauffacher, as I have said,  Swear not to Austria, if you can help it.  Hold by the empire stoutly as of yore,  And God preserve you in your ancient freedom!       [Presses his hand warmly and is going.    STAUFFACHER.  Wait till my mistress comes. Now do! You are  My guest in Schwytz--I in Lucerne am yours.    PFEIFFER.  Thanks! thanks! But I must reach Gersau to-day.  Whatever grievances your rulers' pride  And grasping avarice may yet inflict,  Bear them in patience--soon a change may come.  Another emperor may mount the throne.  But Austria's once, and you are hers forever.                      [Exit.       [STAUFEACHER sits down sorrowfully upon a bench     under the lime tree. Gertrude, his wife, enters,     and finds him in this posture. She places herself     near him, and looks at him for some time in silence.    GERTRUDE.  So sad, my love! I scarcely know thee now.  For many a day in silence I have marked  A moody sorrow furrowing thy brow.  Some silent grief is weighing on thy heart;  Trust it to me. I am thy faithful wife,  And I demand my half of all thy cares.       [STAUFFACHER gives her his hand and is silent.    Tell me what can oppress thy spirits thus?  Thy toil is blest--the world goes well with thee--  Our barns are full--our cattle many a score;  Our handsome team of sleek and well-fed steeds,  Brought from the mountain pastures safely home,  To winter in their comfortable stalls.  There stands thy house--no nobleman's more fair!  'Tis newly built with timber of the best,  All grooved and fitted with the nicest skill;  Its many glistening windows tell of comfort!  'Tis quartered o'er with scutcheons of all hues,  And proverbs sage, which passing travellers  Linger to read, and ponder o'er their meaning.    STAUFFACHER.  The house is strongly built, and handsomely,  But, ah! the ground on which we built it totters.    GERTRUDE.  Tell me, dear Werner, what you mean by that?    STAUFFACHER.  No later since than yesterday, I sat  Beneath this linden, thinking with delight,  How fairly all was finished, when from Kuessnacht  The viceroy and his men came riding by.  Before this house he halted in surprise:  At once I rose, and, as beseemed his rank,  Advanced respectfully to greet the lord,  To whom the emperor delegates his power,  As judge supreme within our Canton here.  \"Who is the owner of this house?\" he asked,  With mischief in his thoughts, for well he knew.  With prompt decision, thus I answered him:  \"The emperor, your grace--my lord and yours,  And held by one in fief.\" On this he answered,  \"I am the emperor's viceregent here,  And will not that each peasant churl should build  At his own pleasure, bearing him as freely  As though he were the master in the land.  I shall make bold to put a stop to this!\"  So saying he, with menaces, rode off,  And left me musing, with a heavy heart,  On the fell purpose that his words betrayed.    GERTRUDE.  Mine own dear lord and husband! Wilt thou take  A word of honest counsel from thy wife?  I boast to be the noble Iberg's child,  A man of wide experience. Many a time,  As we sat spinning in the winter nights,  My sisters and myself, the people's chiefs  Were wont to gather round our father's hearth,  To read the old imperial charters, and  To hold sage converse on the country's weal.  Then heedfully I listened, marking well  What or the wise men thought, or good man wished,  And garnered up their wisdom in my heart.  Hear then, and mark me well; for thou wilt see,  I long have known the grief that weighs thee down.  The viceroy hates thee, fain would injure thee,  For thou hast crossed his wish to bend the Swiss  In homage to this upstart house of princes,  And kept them stanch, like their good sires of old,  In true allegiance to the empire. Say.  Is't not so, Werner? Tell nee, am I wrong?    STAUFFACHER.  'Tis even so. For this doth Gessler hate me.    GERTRUDE.  He burns with envy, too, to see thee living  Happy and free on thy inheritance,  For he has none. From the emperor himself  Thou holdest in fief the lands thy fathers left thee.  There's not a prince in the empire that can show  A better title to his heritage;  For thou hast over thee no lord but one,  And he the mightiest of all Christian kings.  Gessler, we know, is but a younger son,  His only wealth the knightly cloak he wears;  He therefore views an honest man's good fortune  With a malignant and a jealous eye.  Long has he sworn to compass thy destruction  As yet thou art uninjured. Wilt thou wait  Till he may safely give his malice scope?  A wise man would anticipate the blow.    STAUFFACHER.  What's to be done?    GERTRUDE.            Now hear what I advise.  Thou knowest well, how here with us in Schwytz,  All worthy men are groaning underneath  This Gessler's grasping, grinding tyranny.  Doubt not the men of Unterwald as well,  And Uri, too, are chafing like ourselves,  At this oppressive and heart-wearying yoke.  For there, across the lake, the Landenberg  Wields the same iron rule as Gessler here--  No fishing-boat comes over to our side  But brings the tidings of some new encroachment,  Some outrage fresh, more grievous than the last.  Then it were well that some of you--true men--  Men sound at heart, should secretly devise  How best to shake this hateful thraldom off.  Well do I know that God would not desert you,  But lend his favor to the righteous cause.  Hast thou no friend in Uri, say, to whom  Thou frankly may'st unbosom all thy thoughts?    STAUFFACHER.  I know full many a gallant fellow there,  And nobles, too,--great men, of high repute,  In whom I can repose unbounded trust.                     [Rising.    Wife! What a storm of wild and perilous thoughts  Hast thou stirred up within my tranquil breast?  The darkest musings of my bosom thou  Hast dragged to light, and placed them full before me,  And what I scarce dared harbor e'en in thought,  Thou speakest plainly out, with fearless tongue.  But hast thou weighed well what thou urgest thus?  Discord will come, and the fierce clang of arms,  To scare this valley's long unbroken peace,  If we, a feeble shepherd race, shall dare  Him to the fight that lords it o'er the world.  Even now they only wait some fair pretext  For setting loose their savage warrior hordes,  To scourge and ravage this devoted land,  To lord it o'er us with the victor's rights,  And 'neath the show of lawful chastisement,  Despoil us of our chartered liberties.    GERTRUDE.  You, too, are men; can wield a battle-axe  As well as they. God ne'er deserts the brave.    STAUFFACHER.  Oh wife! a horrid, ruthless fiend is war,  That strikes at once the shepherd and his flock.    GERTRUDE.  Whate'er great heaven inflicts we must endure;  No heart of noble temper brooks injustice.    STAUFFACHER.  This house--thy pride--war, unrelenting war,  Will burn it down.    GERTRUDE.            And did I think this heart  Enslaved and fettered to the things of earth,  With my own hand I'd hurl the kindling torch.    "]]]
