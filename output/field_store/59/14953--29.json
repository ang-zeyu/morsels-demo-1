Whether the  scribe had two copies to work from, and simply inserted both, or  whether he copied the short version and added to it as he went along,  cannot be said.  The legend is entitled: Book of knowing the evolutions  of Ra [and of] overthrowing Apep.    This curious \"Book\" describes the origin not only of heaven, and earth,  and all therein, but also of God Himself.  In it the name of Apep is  not even mentioned, and it is impossible to explain its appearance in  the Apep Ritual unless we assume that the whole \"Book\" was regarded as  a spell of the most potent character, the mere recital of which was  fraught with deadly effect for Apep and his friends.    The story of the Creation is supposed to be told by the god Neb-er-  tcher.  This name means the \"Lord to the uttermost limit,\" and the  character of the god suggests that the word \"limit\" refers to time and  space, and that he was, in fact, the Everlasting God of the Universe.  This god's name occurs in Coptic texts, and then he appears as one who  possesses all the attributes which are associated by modern nations  with God Almighty.  Where and how Neb-er-tcher existed is not said, but  it seems as if he was believed to have been an almighty and invisible  power which filled all space.  It seems also that a desire arose in him  to create the world, and in order to do this he took upon himself the  form of the god Khepera, who from first to last was regarded as the  Creator, par excellence, among all the gods known to the Egyptians.  When this transformation of Neb-er-tcher into Khepera took place the  heavens and the earth had not been created, but there seems to have  existed a vast mass of water, or world-ocean, called Nu, and it must  have been in this that the transformation took place.  In this  celestial ocean were the germs of all the living things which  afterwards took form in heaven and on earth, but they existed in a  state of inertness and helplessness.  Out of this ocean Khepera raised  himself, and so passed from a state of passiveness and inertness into  one of activity.  When Khepera raised himself out of the ocean Nu, he  found himself in vast empty space, wherein was nothing on which he  could stand.  The second version of the legend says that Khepera gave  being to himself by uttering his own name, and the first version states  that he made use of words in providing himself with a place on which to  stand.  In other words, when Khepera was still a portion of the being  of Neb-er-tcher, he spake the word \"Khepera,\" and Khepera came into  being.  Similarly, when he needed a place whereon to stand, he uttered  the name of the thing, or place, on which he wanted to stand, and that  thing, or place, came into being.  This spell he seems to have  addressed to his heart, or as we should say, will, so that Khepera  willed this standing-place to appear, and it did so forthwith.  The  first version only mentions a heart, but the second also speaks of a  heart-soul as assisting Khepera in his first creative acts; and we may  assume that he thought out in his heart what manner of thing be wished  to create, and then by uttering its name caused his thought to take  concrete form.  This process of thinking out the existence of things is  expressed in Egyptian by words which mean \"laying the foundation in the  heart.\"    In arranging his thoughts and their visible forms Khepera was assisted  by the goddess Maat, who is usually regarded as the goddess of law,  order, and truth, and in late times was held to be the female  counterpart of Thoth, \"the heart of the god Ra.\"  In this legend,  however, she seems to play the part of Wisdom, as described in the Book  of Proverbs,[FN#3] for it was by Maat that he \"laid the foundation.\"        [FN#3]   \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his  works of old.  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or  ever the earth was.  When there were no depths I was brought forth . .  . . . . . Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I  brought forth: while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,  nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  When he prepared the  heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  when he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the  fountains of the deep: when he gave to the sea his decree, . . . . . .  when he appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by him, as  one brought up with him. . . . . . .\"  Proverbs, viii. 22 ff.}        Having described the coming into being of Khepera and the place on  which he stood, the legend goes on to tell of the means by which the  first Egyptian triad, or trinity, came into existence.  Khepera had, in  some form, union with his own shadow, and so begot offspring, who  proceeded from his body under the forms of the gods Shu and Tefnut.  According to a tradition preserved in the Pyramid Texts[FN#4] this  event took place at On (Heliopolis), and the old form of the legend  ascribes the production of Shu and Tefnut to an act of masturbation.  Originally these gods were the personifications of air and dryness, and  liquids respectively; thus with their creation the materials for the  construction of the atmosphere and sky came into being.  Shu and Tefnut  were united, and their offspring were Keb, the Earth-god, and Nut, the  Sky-goddess.  We have now five gods in existence; Khepera, the creative  principle, Shu, the atmosphere, Tefnut, the waters above the heavens,  Nut, the Sky-goddess, and Keb, the Earth-god.  Presumably about this  time the sun first rose out of the watery abyss of Nu, and shone upon  the world and produced day.  In early times the sun, or his light, was  regarded as a form of Shu.  The gods Keb and Nut were united in an  embrace, and the effect of the coming of light was to separate them. As  long as the sun shone, i.e., as long as it was day, Nut, the Sky-  goddess, remained in her place above the earth, being supported by Shu;  but as soon as the sun set she left the sky and gradually descended  until she rested on the body of the Earth-god, Keb.        [FN#4]   Pepi I., l. 466.        The embraces of Keb caused Nut to bring forth five gods at a birth,  namely, Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys.  Osiris and Isis  married before their birth, and Isis brought forth a son called Horus;  Set and Nephthys also married before their birth, and Nephthys brought  forth a son named Anpu (Anubis), though he is not mentioned in the  legend.  Of these gods Osiris is singled out for special mention in the  legend, in which Khepera, speaking as Neb-er-tcher, says that his name  is Ausares, who is the essence of the primeval matter of which he  himself is formed.  Thus Osiris was of the same substance as the Great  God who created the world according to the Egyptians, and was a  reincarnation of his great-grandfather.  This portion of the legend  helps to explain the views held about Osiris as the great ancestral  spirit, who when on earth was a benefactor of mankind, and who when in  heaven was the saviour of souls.    The legend speaks of the sun as the Eye of Khepera, or Neb-er-tcher,  and refers to some calamity which befell it and extinguished its light.  This calamity may have been simply the coming of night, or eclipses, or  storms; but in any case the god made a second Eye, i.e., the Moon, to  which he gave some of the splendour of the other Eye, i.e., the Sun,  and he gave it a place in his Face, and henceforth it ruled throughout  the earth, and had special powers in respect of the production of  trees, plants, vegetables, herbs, etc.  Thus from the earliest times  the moon was associated with the fertility of the earth, especially in  connection with the production of abundant crops and successful  harvests.    According to the legend, men and women sprang not from the earth, but  directly from the body of the god Khepera, or Neb-er-tcher, who placed  his members together and then wept tears upon them, and men and women,  came into being from the tears which had fallen from his eyes.  No  special mention is made of the creation of beasts in the legend, but  the god says that he created creeping things of all kinds, and among  these are probably included the larger quadrupeds.  The men and women,  and all the other living creatures which were made at that time,  reproduced their species, each in his own way, and so the earth became  filled with their descendants which we see at the present time.    Such is the Legend of Creation as it is found in the Papyrus of Nes-  Menu.  The text of both versions is full of difficult passages, and  some readings are corrupt; unfortunately variant versions by which they  might be corrected are lacking.  The general meaning of the legend in  both versions is quite clear, and it throws considerable light on the  Egyptian religion.  The Egyptians believed in the existence of God, the  Creator and Maintainer of all things, but they thought that the  concerns of this world were committed by Him to the superintendence of  a series of subordinate spirits or beings called \"gods,\" over whom they  believed magical spells and ceremonies to have the greatest influence.  The Deity was a Being so remote, and of such an exalted nature, that it  was idle to expect Him to interfere in the affairs of mortals, or to  change any decree or command which He had once uttered.  The spirits or  \"gods,\" on the other hand, possessing natures not far removed from  those of men, were thought to be amenable to supplications and  flattery, and to wheedling and cajolery, especially when accompanied by  gifts.  It is of great interest to find a legend in which the power of  God as the Creator of the world and the sun and moon is so clearly set  forth, embedded in a book of magical spells devoted to the destruction  of the mythological monster who existed solely to prevent the sun from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#2)"],[1,"the end of his journal, and probably intended for the Appendix,)  may serve as a reply, and show that even the present inhabitants do not  agree in their application of the name Hedjaz. This, says he, is not  used by the Arabian Bedouins in the usual acceptation of the word. They  call Hedjaz exclusively the mountainous country, comprehending many  fertile valleys south of Tayf, and as far as the dwelling-places of the  Asyr Arabs, where the coffee-tree begins to be cultivated abundantly.  This is the general application of the term among all the Bedouins of  those countries; and the towns-people of Mekka and Djidda also use it  in that sense among themselves. But when they converse with foreigners,  whose notions they politely adopt, the name Hedjaz is bestowed on the  country between Tayf, Mekka, Medina, Yembo, and Djidda. The Bedouins  give the name of El Ghor, or the low-land, to the whole province  westward of the mountains from Mekka up to Beder and Yembo; while those  mountains themselves northward of Tayf are called by them Hedjaz-es-  Shám, or the Northern Hedjaz. [This would confirm the derivation of  Hedjaz (mentioned by Golius) from ahhtedjezet, quod (provincia Hhegiaz)  colligata et constricta montibus sit: but others derive it from the  Arabic word yehedjez, because Hedjaz divides Nedjed from Tehama, or  because it connects Yemen with Syria, between which it is situate. As  even the shortest note written by Burckhardt must be considered  valuable, a few lines, that immediately follow the passage above quoted  from his Journal, are here given: I compute the population of the  province usually called Hedjaz, comprising the whole territory of the  Sherif of Mekka, together with that of Medina and the towns situated  therein, and all the Bedouin tribes, at about two hundred and fifty  thousand souls; a number which, I am certain, is rather over than under  rated; the greater part being the Bedouin inhabitants of the mountains,  and principally the strong tribes of Beni Harb.]    [p.xi] On reference to pages 396 and 397, a remark will be found  concerning the different application of this name (Hedjaz) among those  who inhabit the sea-coast and those Bedouins who occupy the interior  country; and it will even appear that doubts have been entertained  whether the sacred city Medina does not belong rather to Nedjed than to  Hedjaz.    From statements so vague as those above quoted, an attempt to trace  exactly the limits of any country must be vain and fallacious: that  region, therefore, which borders on the Red Sea, and which the natives,  we know, entitle unequivocally Hedjaz, is marked in our map, as in  almost every other published hitherto, merely with that name, its first  letter being placed where the editor supposes Arabia Petraea to  terminate, and its last letter where he would separate Hedjaz from  Tehama. [Burckhardt (Syrian Travels p. 511.) quotes Makrizi, the Egyptian  historian, who says, in his chapter on Aila, (Akaba): It is from hence  that the Hedjaz begins: in former times it was the frontier place of the  Greeks, &c.]    To those who seek the most accurate information respecting places but  little known, this work is sufficiently recommended by the name of its  author, and of the country which it describes. The manners of the  Hejazi Arabs have continued, says Sir William Jones, from the time of  Solomon to the present age. [Discourse on the Arabs, Asiat. Researches,  vol. ii.] Our notions of Mecca must be drawn, says Gibbon, from the  Arabians. As no unbeliever is permitted to enter the city, our  travellers are silent; and the short hints of Thevenot are taken from  the suspicious mouth of an African renegado. [Roman Empire, chap. 50.  note 18.]    But the reader of this preface must not be withholden from    [p.xii] perusing Burckhardts authentic and interesting account of the  places which he visited, of the extraordinary ceremonies which he  witnessed, and of the people among whom he lived in the character of a  Muselman.    Some short notices, written on a detached leaf, but evidently intended  by the author as an introduction to his Journal, are given accordingly  in the next page: for, that the Arabian Travels should appear under such  a form as Burckhardt himself probably wished them to assume, has been  throughout a favourite object of the editor,    WILLIAM OUSELY.    London, January, 1829.      [p.xiii] THE AUTHORS INTRODUCTION.    IN the pages of this Journal I have frequently quoted some Arabian  historians, whose works are in my possession. It is now to me a subject  of regret that those manuscripts were not with me in the Hedjaz. The two  first I purchased at Cairo, after my return from Arabia.    These works are--l. The History of Mekka, entitled Akhbar Mekka, a thick  quarto volume, by Aby el Wolyd el Azraky, who flourished in the year of  the Hedjra 223, and has traced the annals of his native city down to  that period. This work is particularly interesting on account of its  topographical notices, and the authors intimate acquaintance with the  state of Arabia before Islám or Mohammedanism. The manuscript appears,  from the hand-writing, to be six, or perhaps seven hundred years old.    2. The History of Mekka, entitled Akd e themyn, in three folio volumes,  by Taky ed' dyn el Fasy, who was himself Kadhy of Mekka. This history  comes down to the year of the Hedjra 829, and is comprised [p.xiv] in  the first volume; the other two volumes containing biographical  anecdotes of distinguished natives of Mekka.    3. The History of the Mosque of Mekka, with which the history of the  town is interwoven, called El Aalam hy aalam beled Allah el haram, in  one volume quarto. The author was Kottob ed dyn el Mekky, who held high  offices at Mekka, and brings the history down to the year 990 of the  Hedjra.    4. The History of the Hedjaz, and more particularly of Mekka, by Asamy.  Of this chronicle I possess only the second volume, a large folio  manuscript, comprising historical records from the time of the Beni  Omeya, to the year (of the Hedjra) 1097. I have not been able to  ascertain the title of this work, which abounds with curious and  valuable information. The author, Asamy, was a native of Mekka.    5. The History of the Temple and Town of Medina. This work is entitled  Khelaset el Wafa, its author was Nour ed dyn Aly Ibn Ahmed e  Samhoudy, [To this writer Burckhardt refers in p. 323, by the letters  (V.S.) Vide Sumhoudy.] and it is comprised in one folio volume,  bringing the history down to the year 911 of the Hedjra.

The name of Kayd Beg, which frequently occurs, is sometimes spelt in the  Ms. Kait Beg, and once erroneously Kail Beg. On reference to  Burckhardts Nubian Travels, it appears that he entered Djidda on the  18th of July, and not on the 15th, as printed in the first page of this  volume through a mistake of the figure 8 for 5; the ink with which he  wrote having in many parts of his Journal faded considerably, and become  of a pale reddish colour. As far, also, as the faded ink in some places  of the Ms. allows the editor (and others who have seen it) to judge,  Mekkawy is used to express a person of Mekka: in many pages of the Ms.  Mekkan is distinctly written, but the Arabic derivative Mekky occurs  only in the Authors Introduction (p. xiv.) Local derivatives similar to  Mekkawy occur in the various parts of Burckhardts works: the present  volume, and his Syrian and Nubian Travels, exhibit Djiddawy, Yembawy,  Kennawy, Dongolawy, Bornawy, Bedjawy, &c. from Djidda, Yembo, Kenne,  Dongola, Bornou, Bedja. &c.    [p.1] TRAVELS    IN    THE HEDJAZ OF ARABIA    DJIDDA    MY arrival in the Hedjaz was attended with some unfavourable  circumstances. On entering the town of Djidda, in the morning of the  15th of July, 1814, I went to the house of a person on whom I had a  letter of credit, delivered to me, at my departure from Cairo, in  January, 1813, when I had not yet fully resolved to extend my travels  into Arabia. From this person I met with a very cold reception; the  letter was thought to be of too old a date to deserve notice: indeed, my  ragged appearance might have rendered any one cautious how he committed  himself with his correspondents, in paying me a large sum of money on  their account; bills and letters of credit are, besides, often trifled  with in the mutual dealings of Eastern merchants; and I thus experienced  a flat refusal, accompanied, however, with an offer of lodgings in the  man's house. This I accepted for the first two days, thinking that, by a  more intimate acquaintance I might convince him that I was neither an  adventurer nor impostor; but finding him inflexible, I removed to one of  the numerous public    [p.2] Khans in the town, my whole stock of money being two"]]]
