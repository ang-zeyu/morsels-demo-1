It is always unpleasant to be the only  survivor of an exceptionally good team. He can't forget last year's  matches, and suffers continual disappointments because the present team  does not play up to the same form.\"    \"He was saying something about rows with the town,\" said Trevor, after  a pause.    \"Yes, there has certainly been some unpleasantness lately. It is the  penalty we pay for being on the outskirts of a town. Four years out of  five nothing happens. But in the fifth, when the school has got a  little out of hand--\"    \"Oh, then it really _has_ got out of hand?\" asked Clowes.    \"Between ourselves, yes,\" admitted Mr Seymour.    \"What sort of rows?\" asked Trevor.    Mr Seymour couldn't explain exactly. Nothing, as it were, definite--as  yet. No actual complaints so far. But still--well, trouble--yes,  trouble.    \"For instance,\" he said, \"a boy in my house, Linton--you remember  him?--is moving in society at this moment with a swollen lip and minus  a front tooth. Of course, I know nothing about it, but I fancy he got  into trouble in the town. That is merely a straw which shows how the  wind is blowing, but if you lived on the spot you would see more what I  mean. There is trouble in the air. And now that this election is coming  on, I should not wonder if things came to a head. I can't remember a  single election in Wrykyn when there was not disorder in the town. And  if the school is going to join in, as it probably will, I shall not be  sorry when the holidays come. I know the headmaster is only waiting for  an excuse to put the town out of bounds.'    \"But the kids have always had a few rows on with that school in the  High Street--what's it's name--St Something?\" said Clowes.    \"Jude's,\" supplied Trevor.    \"St Jude's!\" said Mr Seymour. \"Have they? I didn't know that.\"    \"Oh yes. I don't know how it started, but it's been going on for two or  three years now. It's a School House feud really, but Dexter's are  mixed up in it somehow. If a School House fag goes down town he runs  like an antelope along the High Street, unless he's got one or two  friends with him. I saved dozens of kids from destruction when I was at  school. The St Jude's fellows lie in wait, and dash out on them. I used  to find School House fags fighting for their lives in back alleys. The  enemy fled on my approach. My air of majesty overawed them.\"    \"But a junior school feud matters very little,\" said Mr Seymour. \"You  say it has been going on for three years; and I have never heard of it  till now. It is when the bigger fellows get mixed up with the town that  we have to interfere. I wish the headmaster would put the place out of  bounds entirely until the election is over. Except at election time,  the town seems to go to sleep.\"    \"That's what we ought to be doing,\" said Clowes to Trevor. \"I think we  had better be off now, sir. We promised Mr Donaldson to be in some time  tonight.\"    \"It's later than I thought,\" said Mr Seymour. \"Good night, Clowes. How  many tries was it that you scored this afternoon? Five? I wish you were  still here, to score them for instead of against us. Good night,  Trevor. I was glad to see they tried you for Oxford, though you didn't  get your blue. You'll be in next year all right. Good night.\"    The two Old Wrykinians walked along the road towards Donaldson's. It  was a fine night, but misty.    \"Jove, I'm quite tired,\" said Clowes. \"Hullo!\"    \"What's up?\"    They were opposite Appleby's at the moment. Clowes drew him into the  shadow of the fence.    \"There's a chap breaking out. I saw him shinning down a rope. Let's  wait, and see who it is.\"    A moment later somebody ran softly through the gateway and disappeared  down the road that led to the town.    \"Who was it?\" said Trevor. \"I couldn't see.\"    \"I spotted him all right. It was that chap who was marking me today,  Stanning. Wonder what he's after. Perhaps he's gone to tar the statue,  like O'Hara. Rather a sportsman.\"    \"Rather a silly idiot,\" said Trevor. \"I hope he gets caught.\"    \"You always were one of those kind sympathetic chaps,\" said Clowes.  \"Come on, or Donaldson'll be locking us out.\"          II    SHEEN AT HOME      On the afternoon following the Oxford A match, Sheen, of Seymour's, was  sitting over the gas-stove in his study with a Thucydides. He had been  staying in that day with a cold. He was always staying in. Everyone has  his hobby. That was Sheen's.    Nobody at Wrykyn, even at Seymour's, seemed to know Sheen very well,  with the exception of Drummond; and those who troubled to think about  the matter at all rather wondered what Drummond saw in him. To the  superficial observer the two had nothing in common. Drummond was good  at games--he was in the first fifteen and the second eleven, and had  won the Feather Weights at Aldershot--and seemed to have no interests  outside them. Sheen, on the other hand, played fives for the house, and  that was all. He was bad at cricket, and had given up football by  special arrangement with Allardyce, on the plea that he wanted all his  time for work. He was in for an in-school scholarship, the Gotford.  Allardyce, though professing small sympathy with such a degraded  ambition, had given him a special dispensation, and since then Sheen  had retired from public life even more than he had done hitherto. The  examination for the Gotford was to come off towards the end of the  term.    The only other Wrykinians with whom Sheen was known to be friendly were  Stanning and Attell, of Appleby's. And here those who troubled to think  about it wondered still more, for Sheen, whatever his other demerits,  was not of the type of Stanning and Attell. There are certain members  of every public school, just as there are certain members of every  college at the universities, who are \"marked men\". They have never been  detected in any glaring breach of the rules, and their manner towards  the powers that be is, as a rule, suave, even deferential. Yet it is  one of the things which everybody knows, that they are in the black  books of the authorities, and that sooner or later, in the picturesque  phrase of the New Yorker, they will \"get it in the neck\". To this class  Stanning and Attell belonged. It was plain to all that the former was  the leading member of the firm. A glance at the latter was enough to  show that, whatever ambitions he may have had in the direction of  villainy, he had not the brains necessary for really satisfactory  evildoing. As for Stanning, he pursued an even course of life, always  rigidly obeying the eleventh commandment, \"thou shalt not be found  out\". This kept him from collisions with the authorities; while a ready  tongue and an excellent knowledge of the art of boxing--he was, after  Drummond, the best Light-Weight in the place--secured him at least  tolerance at the hand of the school: and, as a matter of fact, though  most of those who knew him disliked him, and particularly those who,  like Drummond, were what Clowes had called the Old Brigade, he had,  nevertheless, a tolerably large following. A first fifteen man, even in  a bad year, can generally find boys anxious to be seen about with him.    That Sheen should have been amongst these surprised one or two people,  notably Mr Seymour, who, being games' master had come a good deal into  contact with Stanning, and had not been favourably impressed. The fact  was that the keynote of Sheen's character was a fear of giving offence.  Within limits this is not a reprehensible trait in a person's  character, but Sheen overdid it, and it frequently complicated his  affairs. There come times when one has to choose which of two people  one shall offend. By acting in one way, we offend A. By acting in the  opposite way, we annoy B. Sheen had found himself faced by this problem  when he began to be friendly with Drummond. Their acquaintance, begun  over a game of fives, had progressed. Sheen admired Drummond, as the  type of what he would have liked to have been, if he could have managed  it. And Drummond felt interested in Sheen because nobody knew much  about him. He was, in a way, mysterious. Also, he played the piano  really well; and Drummond at that time would have courted anybody who  could play for his benefit \"Mumblin' Mose\", and didn't mind obliging  with unlimited encores.    So the two struck up an alliance, and as Drummond hated Stanning only a  shade less than Stanning hated him, Sheen was under the painful  necessity of choosing between them. He chose Drummond. Whereby he  undoubtedly did wisely.    Sheen sat with his Thucydides over the gas-stove, and tried to interest  himself in the doings of the Athenian expedition at Syracuse. His brain  felt heavy and flabby. He realised dimly that this was because he took  too little exercise, and he made a resolution to diminish his hours of  work per diem by one, and to devote that one to fives. He would mention  it to Drummond when he came in. He would probably come in to tea. The  board was spread in anticipation of a visit from him. Herbert, the  boot-boy, had been despatched to the town earlier in the afternoon, and  had returned with certain food-stuffs which were now stacked in an  appetising heap on the table.    Sheen was just making something more or less like sense out of an  involved passage of Nikias' speech, in which that eminent general  himself seemed to have only a hazy idea of what he was talking about,  when the door opened.    He looked up, expecting to see Drummond, but it was Stanning. He felt  instantly that \"warm shooting\" sensation from which David Copperfield  suffered in moments of embarrassment. Since the advent of Drummond he  had avoided Stanning, and he could not see him without feeling  uncomfortable.

This man's  father was a tailor; and the artist was named after his father's  profession. He was in fact \"the Tailor's Andrea,\" and his father's  name was Angelo.    One story of this brilliant painter which reads from first to last  like a romance has been told by the poet, Browning, who dresses up  fact so as to smother it a little, but there is truth at the bottom.    Andrea married a wife whom he loved tenderly. She had a beautiful face  that seemed full of spirituality and feeling, and Andrea painted it  over and over again. The artist loved his work and dreamed always of  the great things that he should do; but he was so much in love with  his wife that he was dependent on her smile for all that he did which  was well done, and her frown plunged him into despair.    Andrea's wife cared nothing for his genius, painting did not interest  her, and she had no worthy ambition for her husband, but she loved  fine clothes and good living, and so encouraged him enough to keep him  earning these things for her. As soon as some money was made she would  persuade him to work no more till it was spent; and even when he had  made agreements to paint certain pictures for which he was paid in  advance she would torment him till he gave all of his time to her  whims, neglected his duty and spent the money for which he had  rendered no service. Thus in time he became actually dishonest, as we  shall see. It is a sad sort of story to tell of so brilliant a young  man.    Andrea was born in the Gualfonda quarter of Florence, and there is  some record of his ancestors for a hundred years before that, although  their lives were quite unimportant. Andrea was one of four children,  and as usual with Italians of artistic temperament, he was set to work  under the eye of a goldsmith. This craftsmanship of a fine order was  as near to art as a man could get with any certainty of making his  living. It was a time when the Italian world bedecked itself with rare  golden trinkets, wreaths for women's hair, girdles, brooches, and the  like, and the finest skill was needed to satisfy the taste. Thus it  required talent of no mean order for a man to become a successful  goldsmith.    Andrea did not like the work, and instead of fashioning ornaments from  his master's models he made original drawings which did not do at all  in a shop where an apprentice was expected to earn his salt. Certain  fashions had to be followed and people did not welcome fantastic or  new designs. Because of this, Andrea was early put out of his master's  shop and set to learn the only business that he could be got to learn,  painting. This meant for him a very different teacher from the  goldsmith.    The artist may be said to have been his own master, because, even when  he was apprenticed to a painter he was taught less than he already  knew.    That first teacher was Barile, a coarse and unpleasing man, as well as  an incapable one; but he was fair minded, after a fashion, and put  Andrea into the way of finding better help. After a few years under  the direction of Piero di Cosimo, Andrea and a friend, Francia Bigio,  decided to set up shop for themselves.    The two devoted friends pitched their tent in the Piazza del Grano,  and made a meagre beginning out of which great things were to  grow. They began a series of pictures which was to lead at least one  of them to fame. It was in the little Piazza, del Grano studio that  the \"Baptism of Christ\" was painted, a partnership work that had been  planned in the Campagnia dello Scalzo.    \"The Baptism\" was not much of a picture as great pictures go, but it  was a beginning and it was looked at and talked about, which was  something at a time when Titian and Leonardo had set the standard of  great work. In the Piazza del Grano, Andrea and his friend lived in  the stables of the Tuscan Grand Dukes, with a host of other fine  artists, and they had gay times together.    Andrea was a shy youth, a little timid, and by no means vain of his  own work, but he painted with surprising swiftness and sureness, and  had a very brilliant imagination. Its was his main trouble that he had  more imagination than true manhood; he sacrificed everything good to  his imagination.    After the partnership with his friend, he undertook to paint some  frescoes independently, and that work earned for him the name of  \"Andrea senza Errori\"--Andrea the Unerring. Then, as now, each artist  had his own way of working, and Andrea's was perhaps the most  difficult of all, yet the most genius-like. There were those, Michael  Angelo for example, who laid in backgrounds for their paintings; but  Andrea painted his subject upon the wet plaster, precisely as he meant  it to be when finished.    He was unlike the moody Michael Angelo; unlike the gentle Raphael;  unlike the fastidious Van Dyck who came long afterward; he was  hail-fellow-well-met among his associates, though often given over to  dreaminess. He belonged to a jolly club named the \"Kettle Club,\"  literally, the Company of the Kettle; and to another called \"The  Trowel,\" both suggesting an all around good time and much good  fellowship The members of these clubs were expected to contribute to  their wonderful suppers, and Andrea on one occasion made a great  temple, in imitation of the Baptistry, of jelly with columns of  sausages, white birds and pigeons represented the choir and  priests. Besides being \"Andrew the Unerring,\" and a \"Merry Andrew,\" he  was also the \"Tailor's Andrew,\" a man in short upon whom a nickname  sat comfortably. He helped to make the history of the \"Company of the  Kettle,\" for he recited and probably composed a touching ballad called  \"The Battle of the Mice and the Frogs,\" which doubtless had its origin  in a poem of Homer's. But all at once, in the midst of his gay  careless life came his tragedy; he fell in love with a hatter's  wife. This was quite bad enough, but worse was to come, for the hatter  shortly died, and the widow was free to marry Andrea.    After his marriage Andrea began painting a series of Madonnas,  seemingly for no better purpose than to exhibit his wife's beauty over  and over again. He lost his ambition and forgot everything but his  love for this unworthy woman. She was entirely commonplace, incapable  of inspiring true genius or honesty of purpose.    A great art critic, Vasari, who was Andrea's pupil during this time,  has written that the wife, Lucretia, was abominable in every way. A  vixen, she tormented Andrea from morning till night with her bitter  tongue. She did not love him in the least, but only what his money  could buy for her, for she was extravagant, and drove the sensitive  artist to his grave while she outlived him forty years.    About the time of the artist's marriage he painted one fresco, \"The  Procession of the Magi,\" in which he placed a very splendid substitute  for his wife, namely himself. Afterward he painted the Dead Christ  which found its way to France and it laid the foundation for Andrea's  wrongdoing. This picture was greatly admired by the King of France who  above all else was a lover of art. Francis I."]]]
