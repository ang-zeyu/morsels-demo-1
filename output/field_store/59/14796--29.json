She'll see my pie!\"    \"Stop!\" cried Mr. King, getting up somewhat stiffly to his feet, \"I'll  take off the apron myself. There, Phronsie, there you are. Whew! how  hot you keep your kitchen, Jefferson,\" and he wiped his face.    \"Now we'll run,\" said Phronsie softly, \"and not make a bit of noise,  Grandpapa dear, and, Jefferson, please put on my top to the pie, and  don't let it burn, and I'll come down very, very soon again, and bake  one all alone by myself for Grandpapa.\"    The old gentleman kept up very well with the soft patter of her feet  till they reached the foot of the staircase. \"There, there, child,\" he  said, \"there's not the least need of hurry now.\"    \"But she will come down,\" said Phronsie, in gentle haste pulling at his  hand, \"then if she should see it, Grandpapa!\"    \"To be sure; that would indeed be dreadful,\" said Mr. King, getting  over the stairs very creditably. \"There, here we are now. Whew! it's  terribly warm in this house!\"    But there was no danger from Polly; she was at this very instant, not  being able to find Phronsie, hurrying off toward the library in search  of Mrs. Whitney.    \"We want to do the very loveliest thing!\" she cried, rushing in, her  cheeks aflame. \"Oh! pray excuse me.\" She stopped short, blushing  scarlet.    \"Don't feel badly, Polly dear,\" said Mrs. Whitney, over in the dim  light, where the divan was drawn up in the east window, and she held  out her hand and smiled; the other lady whose tete-a-tete was thus  summarily disturbed was elderly and very tall and angular. She put up  her eyeglass at the intrusion and murmured \"Ah?\"    \"This is Polly Pepper,\" said Mrs. Whitney, as Polly, feeling unusually  awkward and shy, stumbled across the library to get within the kind  arms awaiting her.    \"One of the children that your kindness received in this house?\" said  the tall lady, making good use of the eyeglass. The color mounted  steadily on Polly's already rosy cheek, at the scrutiny now going on  with the greatest freedom.    \"One of the dear children who make this house a sunny place for us  all,\" said Mrs. Whitney distinctly.    \"Ah? I see. You are extremely good to put it in that way.\" A low,  well-bred laugh followed this speech. Its sound irritated the young  girl's ear unspeakably, and the brown eyes flashed, and though there  was really no occasion to feel what was not addressed to her, Polly was  quite sure she utterly disliked the lady before her.    \"My dear Mrs. Chatterton,\" said Mrs. Whitney in the gentlest of  accents, \"you do not comprehend; it is not possible for you to  understand how very happy we all are here. The house is quite another  place, I assure you, from the abode you saw last before you went  abroad.\"    Mrs. Chatterton gave another low, unpleasant laugh, and this time  shrugged her shoulders.    \"Polly dear,\" said Mrs. Whitney with a smile, \"say good-morning to Mrs.  Chatterton, and then run away. I will hear your wonderful plan by and  by. I shall be glad to, child,\" she was guilty of whispering in the  small ear.    \"Good-morning, Mrs. Chatterton,\" said Polly slowly, the brown eyes  looking steadily into the traveled and somewhat seamed countenance  before her.    \"Good-morning,\" and Polly found herself once more across the floor, and  safely out in the hall, the door closed between them.    \"Who is she?\" she cried in an indignant spasm to Jasper, who ran up,  and she lifted her eyes brimming over with something quite new to him.  He stopped aghast.    \"Who?\" he cried. \"Oh, Polly! what has happened?\"    \"Mrs. Chatterton. And she looked at me--oh! I can't tell you how she  looked; as if I were a bug, or a hateful worm beneath her,\" cried  Polly, quite as much aghast at herself. \"It makes me feel horridly,  Jasper--you can't think. Oh! that old\"--He stopped, pulling himself up  with quite an effort. \"Has she come back--what brought her, pray tell,  so soon?\"    \"I don't know, I am sure,\" said Polly, laughing at his face. \"I was  only in the room a moment, I think, but it seemed an age with that  eyeglass, and that hateful little laugh.\"    \"Oh! she always sticks up that thing in her eye,\" said Jasper coolly,  \"and she's everlastingly ventilating that laugh on everybody. She  thinks it high-bred and elegant, but it makes people want to kill her  for it.\" He looked and spoke annoyed. \"To think you fell into her  clutches!\" he added.    \"Well, who is she?\" cried Polly, smoothing down her ruffled feathers,  when she saw the effect of her news on him. \"I should dearly love to  know.\"    \"Cousin Algernon's wife,\" said Jasper briefly.    \"And who is he?\" cried Polly, again experiencing a shock that this  dreadful person was a relative to whom due respect must be shown.    \"Oh! a cousin of father's,\" said Jasper. \"He was nice, but he's dead.\"    \"Oh!\" said Polly.    \"She's been abroad for a good half-dozen years, and why she doesn't  stay there when everybody supposed she was going to, astonishes me,\"  said Jasper, after a moment. \"Well, it will not be for long, I presume,  that we shall have the honor; she'll be easily tired of America, and  take herself off again.\"    \"She doesn't stay in this house, does she, Jasper?\" cried Polly in a  tone of horror.    \"No; that is, unless she chooses to, then we can't turn her off. She's  a relative, you know.\"    \"Hasn't she any home?\" asked Polly, \"or any children?\"    \"Home? Yes, an estate down in Bedford County?-Dunraven Lodge; but it's  all shut up, and in the hands of agents who have been trying for the  half-dozen years she was abroad, to sell it for her. She may have come  back to settle down there again, there's no telling what she will do.  In the meantime, I fancy she'll make her headquarters here,\" he said  gloomily.    \"Oh, Jasper!\" exclaimed Polly, seizing his arm, feeling that here was  need of comfort indeed, \"how very dreadful! Don't you suppose something  will happen to take her away?\"    \"I don't see what can,\" said Jasper, prolonging the gloom to feel the  comfort it brought. \"You see she has nobody who wants her, to step in  and relieve us. She has two nephews, but oh! you ought to see them  fight!\"    \"Fight?\" repeated Polly aghast.    \"Yes; you can't dignify their skirmishes by any other name,\" said  Jasper, in disgust. \"So you see our chances for keeping her as long as  she condescends to stay are really very good.\"    Polly clung to his arm in speechless dismay. Meanwhile conversation  fast and brisk was going on between the two shut up in the library.    \"It is greatly to your discredit, Marian,\" said Mrs. Chatterton in a  high, cold voice, \"that you didn't stop all this nonsense on your  father's part, before the thing got to such a pass as to install them  in this house.\"    \"On the contrary,\" said Mrs. Whitney with a little laugh, \"I did  everything I could to further the plan that father wisely made.\"    \"Wisely!\" cried Mrs. Chatterton in scorn. \"Oh, you silly child! don't  you see what it will all tend to?\"    \"I see that it has made us all very happy for five years,\" said Mrs.  Whitney, preserving her composure, \"so I presume the future doesn't  hold much to dread on that score.\"    \"The future is all you have to dread,\" declared Mrs. Chatterton  harshly. \"The present may be well enough; though I should think  existence with that low, underbred family here, would be a\"?    \"You may pause just where you are, Mrs. Chatterton,\" said Marian, still  with the gentlest of accents, but with a determination that made the  other look down at her in astonishment, \"not another word shall you  utter in that strain, nor will I listen to it.\" And with fine temper  undisturbed in her blue eyes, she regarded her relative.    \"Dear me, Marian! I begin to notice your age more now. You shouldn't  fly into such rages; they wear on one fearfully; and especially for a  stranger too, and against your own people--how can you?\"    Mrs. Chatterton drew out a vinaigrette, then a fan from a silken bag,  with clasps that she was always glad to reflect were heirlooms. \"It's  trying, I must confess,\" she declared, alternately applying the  invigorating salts and waving the combination of gauze and sandalwood,  \"to come home to such a reception. But,\" and a heavy sigh, \"I must bear  it.\"    \"You ought to see father,\" cried Mrs. Whitney, rising. \"I must go at  once and tell him of your arrival.\"    \"Oh! I don't know that I care about seeing Cousin Horatio yet,\" said  Mrs. Chatterton carelessly. \"He will probably fall into one of his  rages, and my nerves have been upset quite enough by you. I think I'll  go directly to my apartments.\" She rose also.    \"Father must at once be informed of your arrival,\" repeated Marian  quietly. \"I'll send him in to see you.\"    \"And I shall go to my apartments,\" declared Mrs. Chatterton  determinedly.    \"Hoity-toity!\" exclaimed Mr. King's voice, and in he came, with  Phronsie, fresh from the kitchen, clinging to his hand.          II    COUSIN EUNICE CHATTERTON      Phronsie dropped one small hand by her side, and stood quite still  regarding the visitor.    \"Oh, my goodness me,\" ejaculated Mrs. Chatterton, startled out of her  elegance, and not pausing to adjust the glass, but using her two good  eyes to the best advantage.    \"Hoity-toity! So you are back again!\" exclaimed Mr. King by way of  welcome. \"Well, and if I may ask, what brought you now, Eunice?\"    Mrs. Chatterton gathered herself up and smiled in a superior way.    \"Never mind my reasons, Cousin Horatio.

God hath willed it, as  he pleased: but in my time three of the most execrable persons that  ever I knew in all abomination of life, and the most infamous, have  beene seen to die very orderly and quietly, and in every  circumstance composed even unto perfection. There are some brave and  fortunate deaths. I have seene her cut the twine of some man's life,  with a progresse of wonderful advancement, and with so worthie an  end, even in the flowre of his growth and spring of his youth, that  in mine opinion, his ambitious and haughtie couragious signes,  thought nothing so high as might interrupt them who without going to  the place where he pretended, arived there more gloriously and  worthily than either his desire or hope aimed at, and by his fall  fore-went the power and name, whither by his course he aspired. When  I judge of other men's lives, I ever respect how they have behaved  themselves in their end; and my chiefest study is, I may well  demeane my selfe at my last gaspe, that is to say, quietly and  constantly.          THAT TO PHILOSOPHISE IS TO LEARNE HOW TO DIE    Cicero saith, that to Philosophise is no other thing than for a man  to prepare himselfe to death: which is the reason that studie and  contemplation doth in some sort withdraw our soule from us, and  severally employ it from the body, which is a kind of apprentisage  and resemblance of death; or else it is, that all the wisdome and  discourse of the world, doth in the end resolve upon this point, to  teach us not to feare to die. Truly either reason mockes us, or it  only aimeth at our contentment, and in fine, bends all her travell  to make us live well, and as the holy Scripture saith, \"at our  ease.\" All the opinions of the world conclude, that pleasure is our  end, howbeit they take divers meanes unto and for it, else would men  reject them at their first comming. For, who would give eare unto  him, that for it's end would establish our paine and disturbance?  The dissentions of philosophicall sects in this case are verbal:  Transcurramus solertissimas Hugos [Footnote: Travails, labours.]  \"Let us run over such over-fine fooleries and subtill trifles.\"  There is more wilfulnesse and wrangling among them, than pertains to  a sacred profession. But what person a man undertakes to act, he  doth ever therewithal! personate his owne. Allthough they say, that  in vertue it selfe, the last scope of our aime is voluptuousnes. It  pleaseth me to importune their eares still with this word, which so  much offends their hearing. And if it imply any chief pleasure or  exceeding contentments, it is rather due to the assistance of  vertue, than to any other supply, voluptuousnes being more strong,  sinnowie, sturdie, and manly, is but more seriously voluptuous. And  we should give it the name of pleasure, more favorable, sweeter, and  more naturall; and not terme it vigor, from which it hath his  denomination. Should this baser sensuality deserve this faire name,  it should be by competencie, and not by privilege. I finde it lesse  void of incommodities and crosses than vertue. And besides that> her  taste is more fleeting, momentarie, and fading, she hath her fasts,  her eyes, and her travels, and both sweat and blood. Furthermore she  hath particularly so many wounding passions, and of so severall  sorts, and so filthie and loathsome a societie waiting upon her,  that shee is equivalent to penitencie. Wee are in the wrong, to  thinke her incommodities serve her as a provocation and seasoning to  her sweetnes, as in nature one contrarie is vivified by another  contrarie: and to say, when we come to vertue, that like successes  and difficulties overwhelme it, and yeeld it austere and  inaccessible. Whereas much more properly then unto voluptuousnes,  they ennobled, sharpen, animate, and raise that divine and perfect  pleasure, which it meditates and procureth us. Truly he is verie  unworthie her acquaintance, that counter-ballanceth her cost to his  fruit, and knowes neither the graces nor use of it. Those who go  about to instruct us, how her pursuit is very hard and laborious,  and her jovisance [Footnote: Enjoyment] well-pleasing and  delightfull: what else tell they us, but that shee is ever  unpleasant and irksome? For what humane meane [Footnote: Human  meana. man's life is subject, it is not with an equall care: as well  because accidents are not of such a necessitie, for most men passe  their whole life without feeling any want or povertie, and othersome  without feeling any griefe or sicknes, as Xenophilus the Musitian,  who lived an hundred and six yeares in perfect and continuall  health: as also if the worst happen, death may at all times, and  whensoever it shall please us, cut off all other inconveniences and  crosses. But as for death, it is inevitable.] did ever attaine unto  an absolute enjoying of it? The perfectest have beene content but to  aspire and approach her, without ever possessing her. But they are  deceived; seeing that of all the pleasures we know, the pursute of  them is pleasant. The enterprise is perceived by the qualitie of the  thing, which it hath regard unto: for it is a good portion of the  effect, and consubstantiall. That happines and felicitie, which  shineth in vertue, replenisheth her approaches and appurtenances,  even unto, the first entrance and utmost barre. Now of all the  benefits of vertue, the contempt of death is the chiefest, a meane  that furnisheth our life with an ease-full tranquillitie, and gives  us a pure and amiable taste of it: without which every other  voluptuousnes is extinguished. Loe, here the reasons why all rules  encounter and agree with this article. And albeit they all leade us  with a common accord to despise povertie, and other accidental!  crosses, to which         Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium       Versatur urna, serius, ocius       Sors exitura, et nos in aeternum       Exilium impositura cymbae,       [Footnote: Hor. I. iii. Od. iii. 25.]         All to one place are driv'n, of all       Shak't is the lot-pot, where-hence shall       Sooner or later drawne lots fall,       And to deaths boat for aye enthrall.    And by consequence, if she makes us affeard, it is a continual  subject of torment, and which can no way be eased. There is no  starting-hole will hide us from her, she will finde us wheresoever  we are, we may as in a suspected countrie start and turne here and  there: quae quasi saxum Tantalo semper impendet.[Footnote: Cic. De  Fin. I. i.] \"Which evermore hangs like the stone over the head of  Tantalus:\" Our lawes doe often condemne and send malefactors to be  executed in the same place where the crime was committed: to which  whilest they are going, leade them along the fairest houses, or  entertaine them with the best cheere you can,         non Siculae dapes Dulcem elaborabunt saporem:       Non avium, citharaeque cantus       Somnum reducent.       [Footnote: Hor. I. iii. Od. i, 12.]         Not all King Denys daintie fare,       Can pleasing taste for them prepare:       No song of birds, no musikes sound       Can lullabie to sleepe profound.    Doe you thinke they can take any pleasure in it? or be any thing  delighted? and that the finall intent of their voiage being still  before their eies, hath not altered and altogether distracted their  taste from all these commodities and allurements?         Audit iter, numeratque dies, spatioque viarum       Metitur vitam, torquetur peste futura.       [Footnote: Claud, in Ruff. 1. ii. 137]         He heares his journey, counts his daies, so measures he       His life by his waies length, vext with the ill shall be.    The end of our cariere is death, it is the necessarie object of our  aime: if it affright us, how is it possible we should step one foot  further without an ague? The remedie of the vulgar sort is, not to  think on it. But from what brutall stupiditie may so grosse a  blindnesse come upon him? he must be made to bridle his Asse by the  taile,         Qiti capite ipse suo instituit vestigia retro.       [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iv. 474]         Who doth a course contrarie runne       With his head to his course begunne.    It is no marvell if he be so often taken tripping; some doe no  sooner heare the name of death spoken of, but they are afraid, yea  the most part will crosse themselves, as if they heard the Devill  named. And because mention is made of it in mens wils and  testaments, I warrant you there is none will set his hand to them,  til the physitian hath given his last doome, and utterly forsaken  him. And God knowes, being then betweene such paine and feare, with  what sound judgment they endure him. For so much as this syllable  sounded so unpleasantly in their eares, and this voice seemed so ill  boding and unluckie, the Romans had learned to allay and dilate the  same by a Periphrasis. In liew of saying, he is dead, or he hath  ended his daies, they would say, he hath lived. So it be life, be it  past or no, they are comforted: from whom we have borrowed our  phrases quondam, alias, or late such a one. It may haply be, as the  common saying is, the time we live is worth the mony we pay for it.  I was borne betweene eleven of the clocke and noone, the last of  Februarie 1533, according to our computation, the yeare beginning  the first of Januarie. It is but a fortnight since I was 39 yeares  old. I want at least as much more. If in the meane time I should  trouble my thoughts with a matter so farre from me, it were but  folly. But what? we see both young and old to leave their life after  one selfe-same condition. No man departs otherwise from it, than if  he but now came to it, seeing there is no man so crazed,[Footnote:  Infirm] bedrell, [Footnote: Bedridden.] or decrepit, so long as he  remembers Methusalem, but thinkes he may yet live twentie"]]]
