And that the enquiry into works and that into Brahman  constitute one body of doctrine, he (the Vrittikâra) will declare later  on 'this Sârîraka-doctrine is connected with Jaimini's doctrine as  contained in sixteen adhyâyas; this proves the two to constitute one  body of doctrine.' Hence the earlier and the later Mîmâmsâ are separate  only in so far as there is a difference of matter to be taught by each;  in the same way as the two halves of the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ-sûtras,  consisting of six adhyâyas each, are separate [FOOTNOTE 5:1]; and as each  adhyâya is separate. The entire Mîmâmsâ-sâtra--which begins with the  Sûtra 'Now therefore the enquiry into religious duty' and concludes with  the Sûtra '(From there is) no return on account of scriptural statement'--  has, owing to the special character of the contents, a definite order of  internal succession. This is as follows. At first the precept 'one is to  learn one's own text (svâdhyâya)' enjoins the apprehension of that  aggregate of syllables which is called 'Veda,' and is here referred to  as 'svâdhyâya.' Next there arises the desire to know of what nature the  'Learning' enjoined is to be, and how it is to be done. Here there come  in certain injunctions such as 'Let a Brahnmana be initiated in his  eighth year' and 'The teacher is to make him recite the Veda'; and  certain rules about special observances and restrictions--such as  'having performed the upâkarman on the full moon of Sravana or  Praushthapada according to prescription, he is to study the sacred  verses for four months and a half--which enjoin all the required details.    From all these it is understood that the study enjoined has for its  result the apprehension of the aggregate of syllables called Veda, on  the part of a pupil who has been initiated by a teacher sprung from a  good family, leading a virtuous life, and possessing purity of soul; who  practises certain special observances and restrictions; and who learns  by repeating what is recited by the teacher.    And this study of the Veda is of the nature of a samskâra of the text,  since the form of the injunction 'the Veda is to be studied' shows that  the Veda is the object (of the action of studying). By a samskâra is  understood an action whereby something is fitted to produce some other  effect; and that the Veda should be the object of such a samskaâra is  quite appropriate, since it gives rise to the knowledge of the four  chief ends of human action--viz. religious duty, wealth, pleasure, and  final release--and of the means to effect them; and since it helps to  effect those ends by itself also, viz. by mere mechanical repetition  (apart from any knowledge to which it may give rise).    The injunction as to the study of the Veda thus aims only at the  apprehension of the aggregate of syllables (constituting the Veda)  according to certain rules; it is in this way analogous to the recital  of mantras.    It is further observed that the Veda thus apprehended through reading  spontaneously gives rise to the ideas of certain things subserving  certain purposes. A person, therefore, who has formed notions of those  things immediately, i.e. on the mere apprehension of the text of the  Veda through reading, thereupon naturally applies himself to the study  of the Mimâmsa, which consists in a methodical discussion of the  sentences constituting the text of the Veda, and has for its result the  accurate determination of the nature of those things and their different  modes. Through this study the student ascertains the character of the  injunctions of work which form part of the Veda, and observes that all  work leads only to non-permanent results; and as, on the other hand, he  immediately becomes aware that the Upanishad sections--which form part  of the Veda which he has apprehended through reading--refer to an  infinite and permanent result, viz. immortality, he applies himself to  the study of the Sârîraka-Mîmâmsâ, which consists in a systematic  discussion of the Vedânta-texts, and has for its result the accurate  determination of their sense. That the fruit of mere works is transitory,  while the result of the knowledge of Brahman is something permanent, the  Vedanta-texts declare in many places--'And as here the world acquired by  work perishes, so there the world acquired by merit perishes' (Ch. Up.  VIII, 1,6); 'That work of his has an end' (Bri. Up. III, 8, 10); 'By  non-permanent works the Permanent is not obtained' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 10);  'Frail indeed are those boats, the sacrifices' (Mu. Up. I, 2, 7); 'Let a  Brâhmana, after he has examined all these worlds that are gained by  works, acquire freedom from all desires. What is not made cannot be  gained by what is made. To understand this, let the pupil, with fuel in  his hand, go to a teacher who is learned and dwells entirely in Brahman.  To that pupil who has approached him respectfully, whose mind is  altogether calm, the wise teacher truly told that knowledge of Brahman  through which he knows the imperishable true Person' (Mu. Up. I, 2, 12,  13). 'Told' here means 'he is to tell.'--On the other hand, 'He who  knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'He who sees  this does not see death' (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2); 'He becomes a self-ruler'  (Ch. Up. VII, 25, 2); 'Knowing him he becomes immortal here' (Taitt. Âr.  III, 12, 7); 'Having known him he passes over death; there is no other  path to go' (Svet. Up. VI, 15); 'Having known as separate his Self and  the Mover, pleased thereby he goes to immortality' (Svet. Up. I, 6).    But--an objection here is raised--the mere learning of the Veda with its  auxiliary disciplines gives rise to the knowledge that the heavenly  world and the like are the results of works, and that all such results  are transitory, while immortality is the fruit of meditation on Brahman.  Possessing such knowledge, a person desirous of final release may at  once proceed to the enquiry into Brahman; and what need is there of a  systematic consideration of religious duty (i.e. of the study of the  Purva Mimâmsâ)?--If this reasoning were valid, we reply, the person  desirous of release need not even apply himself to the study of the  Sârîraka Mîmâmsâ, since Brahman is known from the mere reading of the  Veda with its auxiliary disciplines.--True. Such knowledge arises indeed  immediately (without deeper enquiry). But a matter apprehended in this  immediate way is not raised above doubt and mistake. Hence a systematic  discussion of the Vedânta-texts must he undertaken in order that their  sense may be fully ascertained--We agree. But you will have to admit  that for the very same reason we must undertake a systematic enquiry  into religious duty!    [FOOTNOTE 4:1. 'Bhagavat' denotes primarily the Lord, the divinity;  secondarily any holy person.]    [FOOTNOTE 5:1. The first six books of the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ-sûtras give  rules for the fundamental forms of the sacrifice; while the last six  books teach how these rules are to be applied to the so-called modified  forms.]          THE SMALL PÛRVAPAKSHA.    But--a further objection is urged--as that which has to precede the  systematic enquiry into Brahman we should assign something which that  enquiry necessarily presupposes. The enquiry into the nature of duty,  however, does not form such a prerequisite, since a consideration of the  Vedanta-texts may be undertaken by any one who has read those texts,  even if he is not acquainted with works.--But in the Vedanta-texts there  are enjoined meditations on the Udgîtha and the like which are matters  auxiliary to works; and such meditations are not possible for him who is  not acquainted with those works!--You who raise this objection clearly  are ignorant of what kind of knowledge the Sârîraka Mîmâmsâ is concerned  with! What that sâstra aims at is to destroy completely that wrong  knowledge which is the root of all pain, for man, liable to birth, old  age, and death, and all the numberless other evils connected with  transmigratory existence--evils that spring from the view, due to  beginningless Nescience, that there is plurality of existence; and to  that end the sâstra endeavours to establish the knowledge of the unity  of the Self. Now to this knowledge, the knowledge of works--which is  based on the assumption of plurality of existence--is not only useless  but even opposed. The consideration of the Udgîtha and the like, which  is supplementary to works only, finds a place in the Vedânta-texts, only  because like them it is of the nature of knowledge; but it has no direct  connexion with the true topic of those texts. Hence some prerequisite  must be indicated which has reference to the principal topic of the  sâstra.--Quite so; and this prerequisite is just the knowledge of works;  for scripture declares that final release results from knowledge with  works added. The Sûtra-writer himself says further on 'And there is need  of all works, on account of the scriptural statement of sacrifices and  the like' (Ve. Sû. III, 4, 26). And if the required works were not known,  one could not determine which works have to be combined with knowledge  and which not. Hence the knowledge of works is just the necessary  prerequisite.--Not so, we reply. That which puts an end to Nescience is  exclusively the knowledge of Brahman, which is pure intelligence and  antagonistic to all plurality. For final release consists just in the  cessation of Nescience; how then can works--to which there attach  endless differences connected with caste, âsrama, object to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7298"],[0,"William Tell Told Again (#2)"],[1,"    The three spokesmen looked at one another a little doubtfully.    \"We-e-ll,\" said Werner Stauffacher at last, \"as a matter of fact, he  didn't actually _say_ very much. It was more what he _did_,  if you understand me, than what he said.\"    \"I should describe His Excellency the Governor,\" said Walter Fuerst, \"as  a man who has got a way with him--a man who has got all sorts of  arguments at his finger-tips.\"    At the mention of finger-tips, Arnold of Melchthal uttered a sharp  howl.    \"In short,\" continued Walter, \"after a few minutes' very interesting  conversation he made us see that it really wouldn't do, and that we  must go on paying the taxes as before.\"    There was a dead silence for several minutes, while everybody looked at  everybody else in dismay.    The silence was broken by Arnold of Sewa. Arnold of Sewa had been  disappointed at not being chosen as one of the three spokesmen, and he  thought that if he had been so chosen all this trouble would not have  occurred.    \"The fact is,\" he said bitterly, \"that you three have failed to do what  you were sent to do. I mention no names--far from it--but I don't mind  saying that there are some people in this town who would have given a  better account of themselves. What you want in little matters of this  sort is, if I may say so, tact. Tact; that's what you want. Of course,  if you _will_ go rushing into the Governor's presence--\"    \"But we didn't rush,\" said Walter Fuerst.    \"--Shouting out that you want the taxes abolished--\"    \"But we didn't shout,\" said Walter Fuerst.    \"I really cannot speak if I am to be constantly interrupted,\" said  Arnold of Sewa severely. \"What I say is, that you ought to employ tact.  Tact; that's what you want. If I had been chosen to represent the Swiss  people in this affair--I am not saying I ought to have been, mind you;  I merely say _if_ I had been--I should have acted rather after the  following fashion: Walking firmly, but not defiantly, into the tyrant's  presence, I should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about  the weather. The conversation once started, the rest would have been  easy. I should have said that I hoped His Excellency had enjoyed a good  dinner. Once on the subject of food, and it would have been the  simplest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were, and  the whole affair would have been pleasantly settled while you waited. I  do not imply that the Swiss people would have done better to have  chosen me as their representative. I merely say that that is how I  should have acted had they done so.\"    And Arnold of Sewa twirled his moustache and looked offended. His  friends instantly suggested that he should be allowed to try where the  other three had failed, and the rest of the crowd, beginning to hope  once more, took up the cry. The result was that the visitors' bell of  the Palace was rung for the second time. Arnold of Sewa went in, and  the door was banged behind him.    Five minutes later he came out, sucking the first finger of his left  hand.    \"No,\" he said; \"it can't be done. The tyrant has convinced me.\"    \"I knew he would,\" said Arnold of Melchthal.    \"Then I think you might have warned me,\" snapped Arnold of Sewa,  dancing with the pain of his burnt finger.    \"Was it hot?\"    \"Boiling.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Then he really won't let us off the taxes?\" asked the crowd in  disappointed voices.    \"No.\"    \"Then the long and short of it is,\" said Walter Fuerst, drawing a deep  breath, \"that we must rebel!\"    \"Rebel?\" cried everybody.    \"Rebel!\" repeated Walter firmly.    \"We will!\" cried everybody.    \"Down with the tyrant!\" shouted Walter Fuerst.    \"Down with the taxes!\" shrieked the crowd.    A scene of great enthusiasm followed. The last words were spoken by  Werner Stauffacher.    \"We want a leader,\" he said.    \"I don't wish to thrust myself forward,\" began Arnold of Sewa, \"but I  must say, if it comes to leading--\"    \"And I know the very man for the job,\" said Werner Stauffacher.  \"William Tell!\"    \"Hurrah for William Tell!\" roared the crowd, and, taking the time from  Werner Stauffacher, they burst into the grand old Swiss chant which  runs as follows:         \"For he's a jolly good fellow!        For he's a jolly good fellow!!        For he's a jolly good fe-e-ll-ow!!!!        And so say all of us!\"    And having sung this till they were all quite hoarse, they went off to  their beds to get a few hours' sleep before beginning the labours of  the day.          CHAPTER III      In a picturesque little chalet high up in the mountains, covered with  snow and edelweiss (which is a flower that grows in the Alps, and you  are not allowed to pick it), dwelt William Tell, his wife Hedwig, and  his two sons, Walter and William. Such a remarkable man was Tell that I  think I must devote a whole chapter to him and his exploits. There was  really nothing he could not do. He was the best shot with the cross-bow  in the whole of Switzerland. He had the courage of a lion, the  sure-footedness of a wild goat, the agility of a squirrel, and a  beautiful beard. If you wanted someone to hurry across desolate  ice-fields, and leap from crag to crag after a chamois, Tell was the  man for your money. If you wanted a man to say rude things to the  Governor, it was to Tell that you applied first. Once when he was  hunting in the wild ravine of Schaechenthal, where men were hardly  ever to be seen, he met the Governor face to face. There was no way  of getting past. On one side the rocky wall rose sheer up, while below  the river roared. Directly Gessler caught sight of Tell striding along  with his cross-bow, his cheeks grew pale and his knees tottered, and he  sat down on a rock feeling very unwell indeed.    \"Aha!\" said Tell. \"Oho! so it's you, is it? _I_ know you. And a  nice sort of person you are, with your taxes on bread and sheep, aren't  you! You'll come to a bad end one of these days, that's what will  happen to you. Oh, you old reprobate! Pooh!\" And he had passed on with  a look of scorn, leaving Gessler to think over what he had said. And  Gessler ever since had had a grudge against him, and was only waiting  for a chance of paying him out.    \"Mark my words,\" said Tell's wife, Hedwig, when her husband told her  about it after supper that night--\"mark my words, he will never  forgive you.\"    \"I will avoid him,\" said Tell. \"He will not seek me.\"    \"Well, mind you do,\" was Hedwig's reply.    On another occasion, when the Governor's soldiers were chasing a friend  of his, called Baumgarten, and when Baumgarten's only chance of escape  was to cross the lake during a fierce storm, and when the ferryman,  sensibly remarking, \"What! must I rush into the jaws of death? No man  that hath his senses would do that!\" refused to take out his boat even  for twice his proper fare, and when the soldiers rode down to seize  their prey with dreadful shouts, Tell jumped into the boat, and, rowing  with all his might, brought his friend safe across after a choppy  passage. Which made Gessler the Governor still more angry with him.    But it was as a marksman that Tell was so extraordinary. There was  nobody in the whole of the land who was half so skilful. He attended  every meeting for miles around where there was a shooting competition,  and every time he won first prize. Even his rivals could not help  praising his skill. \"Behold!\" they would say, \"Tell is quite the  pot-hunter,\" meaning by the last word a man who always went in for  every prize, and always won it. And Tell would say, \"Yes, truly am I  a pot-hunter, for I hunt to fill the family pot.\" And so he did. He never  came home empty-handed from the chase. Sometimes it was a chamois that  he brought back, and then the family had it roasted on the first day,  cold on the next four, and minced on the sixth, with sippets of toast  round the edge of the dish. Sometimes it was only a bird (as on the  cover of this book), and then Hedwig would say, \"Mark my words, this  fowl will not go round.\" But it always did, and it never happened that  there was not even a fowl to eat.    [Illustration: Frontispiece]    In fact, Tell and his family lived a very happy, contented life, in  spite of the Governor Gessler and his taxes.    Tell was very patriotic. He always believed that some day the Swiss  would rise and rebel against the tyranny of the Governor, and he used  to drill his two children so as to keep them always in a state of  preparation. They would march about, beating tin cans and shouting, and  altogether enjoying themselves immensely, though Hedwig, who did not  like noise, and wanted Walter and William to help her with the  housework, made frequent complaints. \"Mark my words,\" she would say,  \"this growing spirit of militarism in the young and foolish will lead  to no good,\" meaning that boys who played at soldiers instead of  helping their mother to dust the chairs and scrub the kitchen floor  would in all probability come to a bad end. But Tell would say, \"Who  hopes to fight his way through life must be prepared to wield arms.  Carry on, my boys!\" And they carried on. It was to this man that the  Swiss people had determined to come for help.    [Illustration: PLATE II]          CHAPTER IV      Talking matters over in the inn of the town, the Glass and Glacier, the  citizens came to the conclusion that they ought to appoint three  spokesmen to go and explain to Tell just what they wanted him to do.    \"I don't wish to seem to boast at all,\" said Arnold of Sewa, \"but I  think I had better be one of the three.\"    \"I was thinking,\" said Werner Stauffacher, \"that it would be a pity  always to be chopping and changing. Why not choose the same three as  were sent to Gessler?\"    \"I don't desire to be unpleasant at all,\" replied Arnold of Sewa, \"but  I must be forgiven for reminding the honourable gentleman who has just  spoken that he and his equally honourable friends did not meet with the  best of success when"]]]
