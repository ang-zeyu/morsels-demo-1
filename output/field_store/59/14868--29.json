Now  it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.  The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was  terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking  for food, asked, \"What ails thee, friend?\" He told him why. \"I could  free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for  fear thou mightest eat me.\" \"Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat  thee; only save my life.\" \"Very well,\" says he, and caused him to lie  down on his left side. But thinking to himself, \"Who knows what this  fellow will do,\" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws  that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his  mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone  dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he  got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that  it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and  one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking \"I will  sound him,\" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation  spoke this first verse:        \"A service have we done thee        To the best of our ability,      King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!        What return shall we get from thee?\"    In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:        \"As I feed on blood,        And always hunt for prey,      'Tis much that thou art still alive        Having once been between my teeth.\"    Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:        \"Ungrateful, doing no good,        Not doing as he would be done by,      In him there is no gratitude,        To serve him is useless.        \"His friendship is not won        By the clearest good deed.      Better softly withdraw from him,        Neither envying nor abusing.\"    And having thus spoken the crane flew away.    _And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he  used to add: \"Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but  the white crane was I myself.\"_    [Illustration: THE LION AND THE CRANE]          How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.      In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went  out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, \"You can hunt  wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the  fourth side.\" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth  side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he  would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess.    The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time;  but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was  allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth  side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to  hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle,  and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it.  The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up  to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was  called Hiraman parrot.    When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the  other parrots, \"Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son  shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam.\"    Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince  was greatly surprised, and said, \"Why, these birds can talk!\" Then he  said to the parrots, \"Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?\"  But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. \"You can never get  to the Princess Labam's country.\" That is all they would say.    The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more;  and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would  not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed  very ill.    At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the  Princess Labam. \"I must go,\" he said; \"I must see what she is like.  Tell me where her country is.\"    \"We do not know where it is,\" answered his father and mother.    \"Then I must go and look for it,\" said the prince.    \"No, no,\" they said, \"you must not leave us. You are our only son.  Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam.\"    \"I must try and find her,\" said the prince. \"Perhaps God will show me  the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but  perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I  must go.\"    So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with  him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And  he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other  weapons, \"for,\" he said, \"I may want them.\" His father, too, gave him  plenty of rupees.    Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said  good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her  handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her  son. \"My child,\" she said to him, \"When you are hungry eat some of  these sweetmeats.\"    He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a  jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his  horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. \"Now,\" he said to  himself, \"I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I  will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey.\" He opened  his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He  took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two  sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and  another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant.  \"Never mind,\" he said, \"I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat  them.\" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, \"You have  been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will  come to you.\"    The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his  journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there  he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly  from the pain.    \"Why do you roar like that?\" said the young Raja. \"What is the matter  with you?\"    \"I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,\" answered the tiger,  \"and it hurts me so; that is why I roar.\"    \"Well,\" said the Raja's son, \"I will take it out for you. But  perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat  me?\"    [Illustration:]    \"Oh, no,\" said the tiger, \"I won't eat you. Do make me well.\"    Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn  out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than  ever--so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came  bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming,  and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him.    [Illustration:]    \"What man hurt you that you roared so loud?\" said the wife.    \"No one hurt me,\" answered the husband; \"but a Raja's son came and  took the thorn out of my foot.\"    \"Where is he? Show him to me,\" said his wife.    \"If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,\" said the tiger.    \"I won't kill him; only let me see him,\" answered his wife.    Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and  his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good  dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at  the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said  good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, \"If ever you are in  trouble, think of me, and we will come to you.\"    The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he  found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four  things,--a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he  wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels,  food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he  wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and  rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war  on him, \"Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,\" and the  stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up.    The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, \"I  want this;\" another said, \"You cannot have it, for I want it;\" and so  on.    The Raja's son said to them, \"Do not quarrel for these things.

The train that was to explode so fearfully was now laid, and there  wanted but the hand to apply the torch. At last the man appeared upon  the scene. Like all who have ever achieved so great an end, Peter the  hermit was exactly suited to the age; neither behind it, nor in advance  of it; but acute enough to penetrate its mystery ere it was discovered  by any other. Enthusiastic, chivalrous, bigoted, and, if not insane,  not far removed from insanity, he was the very prototype of the time.  True enthusiasm is always persevering and always eloquent, and these  two qualities were united in no common degree in the person of this  extraordinary preacher. He was a monk of Amiens, and ere he assumed the  hood had served as a soldier. He is represented as having been ill  favoured and low in stature, but with an eye of surpassing brightness  and intelligence. Having been seized with the mania of the age, he  visited Jerusalem, and remained there till his blood boiled to see the  cruel persecution heaped upon the devotees. On his return home he shook  the world by the eloquent story of their wrongs.    Before entering into any further details of the astounding results of  his preaching, it will be advisable to cast a glance at the state of  the mind of Europe, that we may understand all the better the causes of  his success. First of all, there was the priesthood, which, exercising  as it did the most conspicuous influence upon the fortunes of society,  claims the largest share of attention. Religion was the ruling idea of  that day, and the only civiliser capable of taming such wolves as then  constituted the flock of the faithful. The clergy were all in all; and  though they kept the popular mind in the most slavish subjection with  regard to religious matters, they furnished it with the means of  defence against all other oppression except their own. In the  ecclesiastical ranks were concentrated all the true piety, all the  learning, all the wisdom of the time; and, as a natural consequence, a  great portion of power, which their very wisdom perpetually incited  them to extend. The people knew nothing of kings and nobles, except in  the way of injuries inflicted. The first ruled for, or more properly  speaking against, the barons, and the barons only existed to brave the  power of the kings, or to trample with their iron heels upon the neck  of prostrate democracy. The latter had no friend but the clergy, and  these, though they necessarily instilled the superstition from which  they themselves were not exempt, yet taught the cheering doctrine that  all men were equal in the sight of heaven. Thus, while Feudalism told  them they had no rights in this world, Religion told them they had  every right in the next. With this consolation they were for the time  content, for political ideas had as yet taken no root. When the clergy,  for other reasons, recommended the Crusade, the people joined in it  with enthusiasm. The subject of Palestine filled all minds; the  pilgrims' tales of two centuries warmed every imagination; and when  their friends, their guides, and their instructors preached a war so  much in accordance with their own prejudices and modes of thinking, the  enthusiasm rose into a frenzy.    But while religion inspired the masses, another agent was at work upon  the nobility. These were fierce and lawless; tainted with every vice,  endowed with no virtue, and redeemed by one good quality alone, that of  courage. The only religion they felt was the religion of fear.  That  and their overboiling turbulence alike combined to guide them to the  Holy Land. Most of them had sins enough to answer for. They lived with  their hand against every man; and with no law but their own passions.  They set at defiance the secular power of the clergy, but their hearts  quailed at the awful denunciations of the pulpit with regard to the  life to come. War was the business and the delight of their existence;  and when they were promised remission of all their sins upon the easy  condition of following their favourite bent, is it to be wondered at  that they rushed with enthusiasm to the onslaught, and became as  zealous in the service of the Cross as the great majority of the  people, who were swayed by more purely religious motives? Fanaticism  and the love of battle alike impelled them to the war, while the kings  and princes of Europe had still another motive for encouraging their  zeal. Policy opened their eyes to the great advantages which would  accrue to themselves, by the absence of so many restless, intriguing,  and blood-thirsty men, whose insolence it required more than the small  power of royalty to restrain within due bounds. Thus every motive was  favourable to the Crusades. Every class of society was alike incited to  join or encourage the war; kings and the clergy by policy, the nobles  by turbulence and the love of dominion, and the people by religious  zeal and the concentrated enthusiasm of two centuries, skilfully  directed by their only instructors.    It was in Palestine itself that Peter the Hermit first conceived the  grand idea of rousing the powers of Christendom to rescue the  Christians of the East from the thraldom of the Mussulmans, and the  sepulchre of Jesus from the rude hands of the infidel. The subject  engrossed his whole mind. Even in the visions of the night he was full  of it. One dream made such an impression upon him, that he devoutly  believed the Saviour of the world himself appeared before him, and  promised him aid and protection in his holy undertaking. If his zeal  had ever wavered before, this was sufficient to fix it for ever.    Peter, after he had performed all the penances and duties of his  pilgrimage, demanded an interview with Simeon, the Patriarch of the  Greek Church at Jerusalem. Though the latter was a heretic in Peter's  eyes, yet he was still a Christian, and felt as acutely as himself for  the persecutions heaped by the Turks upon the followers of Jesus. The  good prelate entered fully into his views, and, at his suggestion,  wrote letters to the Pope, and to the most influential monarchs of  Christendom, detailing the sorrows of the faithful, and urging them to  take up arms in their defence. Peter was not a laggard in the work.  Taking an affectionate farewell of the Patriarch, he returned in all  haste to Italy. Pope Urban II. occupied the apostolic chair. It was at  that time far from being an easy seat. His predecessor, Gregory, had  bequeathed him a host of disputes with the Emperor Henry IV. of  Germany, and he had made Philip I. of France his enemy by his strenuous  opposition to an adulterous connexion formed by that monarch. So many  dangers encompassed him about, that the Vatican was no secure abode,  and he had taken refuge in Apulia, under the protection of the renowned  Robert Guiscard. Thither Peter appears to have followed him, though in  what spot their meeting took place is not stated with any precision by  ancient chroniclers or modern historians.  Urban received him most  kindly; read, with tears in his eyes, the epistle from the Patriarch  Simeon, and listened to the eloquent story of the Hermit with an  attention which showed how deeply he sympathised with the woes of the  Christian church. Enthusiasm is contagious, and the Pope appears to  have caught it instantly from one whose zeal was so unbounded. Giving  the Hermit full powers, he sent him abroad to preach the holy war to  all the nations and potentates of Christendom.  The Hermit preached,  and countless thousands answered to his call.  France, Germany, and  Italy started at his voice, and prepared for the deliverance of Zion.  One of the early historians of the Crusade, who was himself an  eye-witness of the rapture of Europe, [Guibert de Nogent] describes the  personal appearance of the Hermit at this time.  He says, that there  appeared to be something of divine in every thing which he said or did.  The people so highly reverenced him, that they plucked hairs from the  mane of his mule, that they might keep them as relics. While preaching,  he wore in general a woollen tunic, with a dark-coloured mantle, which  fell down to his heels. His arms and feet were bare, and he ate neither  flesh nor bread, supporting himself chiefly upon fish and wine. \"He set  out,\" says the chronicler, \"from whence I know not; but we saw him  passing through the towns and villages, preaching every where, and the  people surrounding him in crowds, loading him with offerings, and  celebrating his sanctity with such great praises that I never remember  to have seen such honours bestowed upon any one.\" Thus he went on,  untired, inflexible, and full of devotion, communicating his own  madness to his hearers, until Europe was stirred from its very depths.    While the Hermit was appealing with such signal success to the people,  the Pope appealed with as much success to those who were to become the  chiefs and leaders of the expedition. His first step was to call a  council at Placentia, in the autumn of the year 1095. Here, in the  assembly of the clergy, the Pope debated the grand scheme, and gave  audience to emissaries who had been sent from Constantinople by the  Emperor of the East to detail the progress made by the Turks in their  design of establishing themselves in Europe. The clergy were of course  unanimous in support of the Crusade, and the council separated, each  individual member of it being empowered to preach it to his people.    But Italy could not be expected to furnish all the aid required; and  the Pope crossed the Alps to inspire the fierce and powerful nobility  and chivalrous population of Gaul. His boldness in entering the  territory, and placing himself in the power of his foe, King Philip of  France, is not the least surprising feature of his mission.  Some have  imagined that cool policy alone actuated him, while others assert, that  it was "]]]
