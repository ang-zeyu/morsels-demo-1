But this is not enough. Our  ultimate security requires more than a process of consultation and  compromise.    It requires that we begin now to develop the United Nations Organization as  the representative of the world as one society. The United Nations  Organization, if we have the will adequately to staff it and to make it  work as it should, will provide a great voice to speak constantly and  responsibly in terms of world collaboration and world well-being.    There are many new responsibilities for us as we enter into this new  international era. The whole power and will and wisdom of our Government  and of our people should be focused to contribute to and to influence  international action. It is intricate, continuing business. Many  concessions and adjustments will be required.    The spectacular progress of science in recent years makes these necessities  more vivid and urgent. That progress has speeded internal development and  has changed world relationships so fast that we must realize the fact of a  new era. It is an era in which affairs have become complex and rich in  promise. Delicate and intricate relationships, involving us all in  countless ways, must be carefully considered.    On the domestic scene, as well as on the international scene, we must lay a  new and better foundation for cooperation. We face a great peacetime  venture; the challenging venture of a free enterprise economy making full  and effective use of its rich resources and technical advances. This is a  venture in which business, agriculture, and labor have vastly greater  opportunities than heretofore. But they all also have vastly greater  responsibilities. We will not measure up to those responsibilities by the  simple return to \"normalcy\" that was tried after the last war.    The general objective, on the contrary, is to move forward to find the way  in time of peace to the full utilization and development of our physical  and human resources that were demonstrated so effectively in the war.    To accomplish this, it is not intended that the Federal Government should  do things that can be done as well for the Nation by private enterprise, or  by State and local governments. On the contrary, the war has demonstrated  how effectively we can organize our productive system and develop the  potential abilities of our people by aiding the efforts of private  enterprise.    As we move toward one common objective there will be many and urgent  problems to meet.    Industrial peace between management and labor will have to be  achieved--through the process of collective bargaining--with Government  assistance but not Government compulsion. This is a problem which is the  concern not only of management, labor, and the Government, but also the  concern of every one of us.    Private capital and private management are entitled to adequate reward for  efficiency, but business must recognize that its reward results from the  employment of the resources of the Nation. Business is a public trust and  must adhere to national standards in the conduct of its affairs. These  standards include as a minimum the establishment of fair wages and fair  employment practices.    Labor also has its own new peacetime responsibilities. Under our collective  bargaining system, which must become progressively more secure, labor  attains increasing political as well as economic power, and this, as with  all power, means increased responsibility.    The lives of millions of veterans and war workers will be greatly affected  by the success or failure of our program of war liquidation and  reconversion. Their transition to peacetime pursuits will be determined by  our efforts to break the bottlenecks in key items of production, to make  surplus property immediately available where it is needed, to maintain an  effective national employment service, and many other reconversion  policies. Our obligations to the people who won the war will not be paid if  we fail to prevent inflation and to maintain employment opportunities.    While our peacetime prosperity will be based on the private enterprise the  government can and must assist in many ways. It is the Government's  responsibility to see that our economic system remains competitive, that  new businesses have adequate opportunities, and that our national resources  are restored and improved. Government must realize the effect of its  operations on the whole economy. It is the responsibility of Government to  gear its total program to the achievement of full production and full  employment.    Our basic objective--toward which all others lead--is to improve the  welfare of the American people. In addition to economic prosperity, this  means that we use social security in the fullest sense of the word. And  people must be protected from excessive want during old age, sickness, and  unemployment. Opportunities for a good economy and adequate medical care  must be readily available. Every family should build a decent home. The new  economic rights to which I have referred on previous occasions is a charter  of economic freedom which seeks to assure that all who will may work toward  their own security and the general advancement; that we become a  well-housed people, a well-nourished people, an educated people, a people  socially and economically secure, an alert and responsible people.    These and other problems which may face us can be met by the cooperation of  all of us in furthering a positive and well-balanced Government program--a  program which will further national and international well-being.    II. THE FEDERAL PROGRAM    INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS    I. FOREIGN POLICY    The year 1945 brought with it the final defeat of our enemies. There lies  before us now the work of building a just and enduring peace.    Our most immediate task toward that end is to deprive our enemies  completely and forever of their power to start another war. Of even greater  importance to the preservation of international peace is the need to  preserve the wartime agreement of the United Nations and to direct it into  the ways of peace.    Long before our enemies surrendered, the foundations had been laid on which  to continue this unity in the peace to come. The Atlantic meeting in 1941  and the conferences at Casablanca, Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, Tehran, and  Dumbarton Oaks each added a stone to the structure.    Early in 1945, at Yalta, the three major powers broadened and solidified  this base of understanding. There fundamental decisions were reached  concerning the occupation and control of Germany. There also a formula was  arrived at for the interim government of the areas in Europe which were  rapidly being wrested from Nazi control. This formula was based on the  policy of the United States that people be permitted to choose their own  form of government by their own freely expressed choice without  interference from any foreign source.    At Potsdam, in July 1945, Marshal Stalin, Prime Ministers Churchill and  Attlee, and I met to exchange views primarily with respect to Germany. As a  result, agreements were reached which outlined broadly the policy to be  executed by the Allied Control Council. At Potsdam there was also  established a Council of Foreign Ministers which convened for the first  time in London in September. The Council is about to resume its primary  assignment of drawing up treaties of peace with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria,  Hungary, and Finland.    In addition to these meetings, and, in accordance with the agreement at  Yalta, the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the  United States conferred together in San Francisco last spring, in Potsdam  in July, in London in September, and in Moscow in December. These meetings  have been useful in promoting understanding and agreement among the three  governments.    Simply to name all the international meetings and conferences is to suggest  the size and complexity of the undertaking to prevent international war in  which the United States has now enlisted for the duration of history.    It is encouraging to know that the common effort of the United Nations to  learn to live together did not cease with the surrender of our enemies.    When difficulties arise among us, the United States does not propose to  remove them by sacrificing its ideals or its vital interests. Neither do we  propose, however, to ignore the ideals and vital interests of our friends.    Last February and March an Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and  Peace was held in Mexico City. Among the many significant accomplishments  of that Conference was an understanding that an attack by any country  against any one of the sovereign American republics would be considered an  act of aggression against all of them; and that if such an attack were made  or threatened, the American republics would decide jointly, through  consultations in which each republic has equal representation, what  measures they would take for their mutual protection. This agreement  stipulates that its execution shall be in full accord with the Charter of  the United Nations Organization.    The first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations now in  progress in London marks the real beginning of our bold adventure toward  the preservation of world peace, to which is bound the dearest hope of  men.    We have solemnly dedicated ourselves and all our will to the success of the  United Nations Organization. For this reason we have sought to insure that  in the peacemaking the smaller nations shall have a voice as well as the  larger states. The agreement reached at Moscow last month preserves this  opportunity in the making of peace with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary,  and Finland. The United States intends to preserve it when the treaties  with Germany and Japan are drawn.

R. C. EVANS, WHO IS  PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF HIS CHURCH IN CANADA, NOT A BELIEVER IN  POLYGAMY--DENOUNCES THE UTAH MORMONS.    The name Mormon does not please Toronto's six hundred baptized  Latter-day Saints, not to mention the fifty thousand others scattered  over the globe.    This fact was emphasized today, when R. C. Evans, one of the three  members of the Presidency, explained the radical difference between the  two denominations. Mr. Evans, who reached Toronto a few days ago to  spend a month here, denounces the \"Utah Mormon and his iniquities.\"    \"We do not believe in polygamy, blood atonement, and kindred evils,\"  he said to the _Star_ last night at 142 Peter street, where he is  visiting, \"They are an abomination to the Lord. The term Mormon is  offensive to us, because it is associated in the public mind with the  practices that I have specified. The other night, while I was holding a  service here, four Utah Elders came to me. I referred to polygamy, and  they defended it. 'We endorse it,' they told me, 'but we don't practice  it.' Three women were with them, and I said to one, 'Do you believe in  polygamy?' 'I do,' she replied, 'and I know that God will punish the  United States for prohibiting it.' I understand that there are five  Utah elders in Toronto at the present time, and in addresses here I  will expose polygamy and blood atonement.\"      BORN NEAR MONTREAL    Mr. Evans is forty-three years old, but doesn't look his age. He is  rather below medium height, strongly built, wears his black hair short,  and his round, slightly olive face is clean shaven. He is animated in  manner, and though his English is occasionally at fault, he speaks  fluently and well. He was born at St. Andrew's near Montreal, but his  ancestry is not confined to any one country, Irish, Welsh and German  blood flows in his veins and his somewhat nasal voice is typically  American.    \"I was baptized in 1876,\" he said, \"ordained a priest in 1882, became  an elder in 1884, entered the quorum of seventy in 1886, was chosen  one of the twelve apostles in 1897; and in 1902, was selected one of  President Joseph Smith's two counselors, the other being his eldest  son, Frederick M. Smith. I was the pastor of the London, Ontario,  church from 1882 to 1886, and have given particular attention to  Canada. We occupy a rented church on the corner of Sumac and St. David  streets, a new church on Camden street, and another at Humber Bay,  practically three congregations in Toronto.\"    The Latter-day Saints and the Utah Mormons, according to Mr. Evans, are  frequently confused, greatly to his regret.      TROUBLES OF THE SECT    \"My President Joseph Smith,\" he explained, \"is the oldest son of Joseph  Smith, who, when a boy of fifteen, was directed to the mound wherein he  found the golden plates from which he compiled the Book of Mormon.    \"He organized his church in 1830, when 25 years old, and between  1830 and 1844 his following numbered 200,000. In 1844 he was shot  and killed for his anti-slavery sympathies,[1] and with him died his  brother Hyrum. John Taylor, a Toronto convert of 1838, was wounded, but  recovered. Joseph Smith's city of Nauvoo, Illinois, was wrecked, and in  1847, at Kanesville, Iowa, Brigham Young was elected president, though  he still professed to hold the office in trust for the dead president's  eldest son, also, Joseph, whom the father had consecrated as his  successor.[2] Brigham Young reorganized[3] the church, rebaptized every  member, including himself, and in 1848 (1847) he reached Salt Lake  City. With him went the widow and children of Hyrum Smith, whose son  Joseph F., is now president of the Utah church. The widow of the first  president had refused to follow Young, and her boy Joseph was brought  up in his father's footsteps, hating polygamy and other impurities.  'Young Joseph,' as he was called, connected himself with the Saints,  who had rejected Brigham Young, and was elected their president. He  was then 28 years old. In 1872 he was called to Washington, a report  having reached the Government that Mormonism had again sprung up in  Illinois. He disproved the charge of polygamy and blood atonement,  and demonstrated that Latter-day Saintism was in keeping with the law  and supported by the Bible. Incorporation was granted, and we have  prospered.      UPHELD DEATH    \"Brigham Young, who had been under suspicion at Joseph Smith's death,  introduced polygamy and blood atonement at Salt Lake City. Blood  atonement meant death to anyone who left his church. Brigham Young's  argument was that the apostate whose throat was cut from ear to ear,  the favorite way, saved his soul, but his object was to keep his people  under his iron heel. Young was a shrewd, bad man.    \"I spent a day and a half with Joseph F. Smith at Salt Lake City three  years ago, and he gave me a group photo of himself, his surviving five  wives, and thirty-six children. His first wife was dead. She died  broken-hearted and insane. Personally, Joseph F. Smith is a genial,  kindly man, but he and I differed on Polygamy. I told him it was vile  and wicked, always had been, and always would be. In appearance he  resembles his cousin, my own president.\"    Mr. Evans is married, and has two children. The three faces look at  you from his watch case. He has recently returned from the northwest.  His faith has several thriving churches there, he says, while the Utah  Mormons are settled in one part of Alberta.      Footnotes    1. Mr. Evans' declaration that the Prophet was killed for his anti-  slavery sympathies is rather surprising, when we consider that he was  in one of the anti-slave states, and the mob at Carthage was largely  composed of men with very strong \"anti-slavery sympathies.\" The fact  is he and his brother Hyrum were martyred for their religion of which  Celestial Marriage, (including Plural Marriage) formed a part. One of  the charges made against them was that of teaching \"polygamy.\"    2. In proof that the Prophet did not ordain or consecrate his son as  his successor, the reader is referred to the affidavits of John W.  Rigdon and Bathsheba W. Smith.    3. As the Church was never disorganized, it could not be reorganized.  Mr. Evans has made a mistake. It was the Quorum of the First  Presidency that was disorganized at the Prophet's death and which was  _reorganized_ when Brigham Young was elected President, and not the  Church.        REPLY TO R. C. EVANS    The following letter was published in the Toronto _Daily Star_ in  answer to the false charges which appeared in Mr. Evans' interview.    Salt Lake City, Feb. 19, 1905.    _Mr. R. C. Evans_,    _Counselor in Presidency of Reorganized Church_.    Sir:--I have before me a copy of the Toronto _Daily Star_, bearing date  of January 28, last, in which there is a column on the front page,  purporting to be an interview, by a representative of that paper with  you, in which I desire to call your attention.    In doing so I desire to be fair and dispassionate, and also candid, and  I would like it if you would receive and reply to this communication in  the same spirit and manner to me personally.    You are reported as not being \"pleased,\" nor Toronto's six hundred  baptized members, with the name \"Mormon.\" \"This fact,\" says the _Star_,  \"was emphasized today when R. C. Evans, one of the three members  of the Presidency explained the radical difference between the two  denominations. Mr. Evans * * * denounced the Utah Mormon and his  iniquities.\" Then you are made to say: \"The term Mormon is offensive  to us, because it is associated in the public mind with the practices  that I have specified.\" That is, the alleged practices of the Utah  \"Mormons,\" namely, \"polygamy and blood atonement.\"    Did you know that \"the term Mormon\" has always been applied to the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? That the name attached  to the Church with the publication and promulgation of the Book of  Mormon? That it was first applied by the enemies of the Church as an  opprobrium; but that during the lifetime of Joseph Smith the Martyr,  and ever since it has been a term accepted by the Church because of  popular custom, as an appellation?    If, then, the name is so distasteful to you and your fellows in  Canada and throughout the world, although it be on the grounds you  have named, why do you not discard the Book of Mormon, from whence  the name is derived, as well as the name. Is not the term _Book of  Mormon_ as closely associated in the public mind with \"polygamy and  blood atonement,\" as is the _name_ of the Book? How are you going to  disassociate the book itself from the name as commonly applied to  the Church, since this name has been attached to the Church from the  beginning, and before the alleged \"practices\" of the \"Utah Mormon\"  gained such publicity? _Really, I think it would be quite proper for  those holding the view which you are said to have expressed, not only  to renounce the name \"Mormon\" as applied to the Church but also the  Book itself_.[1]    You do not believe in blood atonement. Is not this the more reason why  you should discard the Book of Mormon? Are you not at issue with the  teachings not only of that book, but also with those of the Bible on  this matter? If so, why not discard the Bible, and while you are about  it, the Book of Doctrine and Covenants also? Both of these, as well as  the Book of Mormon, teach the doctrine of \"blood atonement,\" and they  are all \"associated in the public mind\" with the alleged \"practices\" of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    Let us consider this subject of \"blood atonement.\"    Book of Mormon:        Mosiah 3:11.--His blood atoneth for the sins of those who have      fallen by the transgression of Adam.
