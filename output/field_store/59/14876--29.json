There was a pale and awful silence.  Not a limb stirred.  Not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath.    \"Is that all?\" I asked, in a voice of the most perfect calmness.    \"All, fair sir, save that certain matters of light moment are  placed together under a head hight sundries.  If it would like  you, I will sepa--\"    \"It is of no consequence,\" I said, accompanying the words with  a gesture of the most utter indifference; \"give me the grand  total, please.\"    The clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself, and said:    \"Thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays!\"    The wheelwright fell off his stool, the others grabbed the table  to save themselves, and there was a deep and general ejaculation of:    \"God be with us in the day of disaster!\"    The clerk hastened to say:    \"My father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you  to pay it all at this time, and therefore only prayeth you--\"    I paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze, but, with an  air of indifference amounting almost to weariness, got out my money  and tossed four dollars on to the table.  Ah, you should have seen  them stare!    The clerk was astonished and charmed.  He asked me to retain  one of the dollars as security, until he could go to town and  --I interrupted:    \"What, and fetch back nine cents?  Nonsense!  Take the whole.  Keep the change.\"    There was an amazed murmur to this effect:    \"Verily this being is _made_ of money!  He throweth it away even  as if it were dirt.\"    The blacksmith was a crushed man.    The clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune.  I said  to Marco and his wife:    \"Good folk, here is a little trifle for you\"--handing the miller-guns  as if it were a matter of no consequence, though each of them  contained fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures  went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude, I turned to the  others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day:    \"Well, if we are all ready, I judge the dinner is.  Come, fall to.\"    Ah, well, it was immense; yes, it was a daisy.  I don't know that  I ever put a situation together better, or got happier spectacular  effects out of the materials available.  The blacksmith--well, he  was simply mashed.  Land! I wouldn't have felt what that man was  feeling, for anything in the world.  Here he had been blowing and  bragging about his grand meat-feast twice a year, and his fresh  meat twice a month, and his salt meat twice a week, and his white  bread every Sunday the year round--all for a family of three; the  entire cost for the year not above 69.2.6 (sixty-nine cents, two  mills and six milrays), and all of a sudden here comes along a man  who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out; and not  only that, but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small  sums.  Yes, Dowley was a good deal wilted, and shrunk-up and  collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that's been  stepped on by a cow.        CHAPTER XXXIII    SIXTH CENTURY POLITICAL ECONOMY    However, I made a dead set at him, and before the first third  of the dinner was reached, I had him happy again.  It was easy  to do--in a country of ranks and castes.  You see, in a country  where they have ranks and castes, a man isn't ever a man, he is  only part of a man, he can't ever get his full growth.  You prove  your superiority over him in station, or rank, or fortune, and  that's the end of it--he knuckles down.  You can't insult him  after that.  No, I don't mean quite that; of course you _can_ insult  him, I only mean it's difficult; and so, unless you've got a lot  of useless time on your hands it doesn't pay to try.  I had the  smith's reverence now, because I was apparently immensely prosperous  and rich; I could have had his adoration if I had had some little  gimcrack title of nobility.  And not only his, but any commoner's  in the land, though he were the mightiest production of all the ages,  in intellect, worth, and character, and I bankrupt in all three.  This was to remain so, as long as England should exist in the  earth.  With the spirit of prophecy upon me, I could look into  the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable  Georges and other royal and noble clothes-horses, and leave unhonored  the creators of this world--after God--Gutenburg, Watt, Arkwright,  Whitney, Morse, Stephenson, Bell.    The king got his cargo aboard, and then, the talk not turning upon  battle, conquest, or iron-clad duel, he dulled down to drowsiness  and went off to take a nap.  Mrs. Marco cleared the table, placed  the beer keg handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings  in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters  near and dear to the hearts of our sort--business and wages,  of course.  At a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding  prosperous in this little tributary kingdom--whose lord was  King Bagdemagus--as compared with the state of things in my own  region.  They had the \"protection\" system in full force here,  whereas we were working along down toward free-trade, by easy  stages, and were now about half way.  Before long, Dowley and I  were doing all the talking, the others hungrily listening.  Dowley  warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in the air, and began  to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me,  and they did have something of that look:    \"In your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff,  master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?\"    \"Twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent.\"    The smith's face beamed with joy.  He said:    \"With us they are allowed the double of it!  And what may a mechanic  get--carpenter, dauber, mason, painter, blacksmith, wheelwright,  and the like?\"    \"On the average, fifty milrays; half a cent a day.\"    \"Ho-ho!  With us they are allowed a hundred!  With us any good  mechanic is allowed a cent a day!  I count out the tailor, but  not the others--they are all allowed a cent a day, and in driving  times they get more--yes, up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen  milrays a day.  I've paid a hundred and fifteen myself, within  the week.  'Rah for protection--to Sheol with free-trade!\"    And his face shone upon the company like a sunburst.  But I didn't  scare at all.  I rigged up my pile-driver, and allowed myself  fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth--drive him _all_ in  --drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show  above ground.  Here is the way I started in on him.  I asked:    \"What do you pay a pound for salt?\"    \"A hundred milrays.\"    \"We pay forty.  What do you pay for beef and mutton--when you  buy it?\"  That was a neat hit; it made the color come.    \"It varieth somewhat, but not much; one may say seventy-five milrays  the pound.\"    \"_We_ pay thirty-three.  What do you pay for eggs?\"    \"Fifty milrays the dozen.\"    \"We pay twenty.  What do you pay for beer?\"    \"It costeth us eight and one-half milrays the pint.\"    \"We get it for four; twenty-five bottles for a cent.  What do you pay for wheat?\"    \"At the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel.\"    \"We pay four hundred.  What do you pay for a man's tow-linen suit?\"    \"Thirteen cents.\"    \"We pay six.  What do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the  laborer or the mechanic?\"    \"We pay eight cents, four mills.\"    \"Well, observe the difference: you pay eight cents and four mills,  we pay only four cents.\"  I prepared now to sock it to him.  I said:  \"Look here, dear friend, _what's become of your high wages you  were bragging so about a few minutes ago?_\"--and I looked around  on the company with placid satisfaction, for I had slipped up  on him gradually and tied him hand and foot, you see, without his  ever noticing that he was being tied at all.  \"What's become of  those noble high wages of yours?--I seem to have knocked the  stuffing all out of them, it appears to me.\"    But if you will believe me, he merely looked surprised, that  is all! he didn't grasp the situation at all, didn't know he had  walked into a trap, didn't discover that he was _in_ a trap.  I could  have shot him, from sheer vexation.  With cloudy eye and a struggling  intellect he fetched this out:    \"Marry, I seem not to understand.  It is _proved_ that our wages  be double thine; how then may it be that thou'st knocked therefrom  the stuffing?--an miscall not the wonderly word, this being the  first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted  me to hear it.\"    Well, I was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on  his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with  him and were of his mind--if you might call it mind.  My position  was simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified  more?  However, I must try:    \"Why, look here, brother Dowley, don't you see?  Your wages are  merely higher than ours in _name_, not in _fact_.\"    \"Hear him!  They are the _double_--ye have confessed it yourself.\"    \"Yes-yes, I don't deny that at all.  But that's got nothing to do  with it; the _amount_ of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless  names attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do  with it.  The thing is, how much can you _buy_ with your wages?  --that's the idea.  While it is true that with you a good mechanic  is allowed about three dollars and a half a year, and with us only  about a dollar and seventy-five--\"    \"There--ye're confessing it again, ye're confessing it again!\"    \"Confound it, I've "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7249"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 8. (#2)"],[1,"all my wit was knocked  out of me--and so forth and so on, and got myself away, still  mumbling.  I didn't wait for breakfast.  No grass grew under my  feet.  I was soon at the slave quarters.  Empty--everybody gone!  That is, everybody except one body--the slave-master's.  It lay  there all battered to pulp; and all about were the evidences of  a terrific fight.  There was a rude board coffin on a cart at  the door, and workmen, assisted by the police, were thinning a  road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in.    I picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk  with one so shabby as I, and got his account of the matter.    \"There were sixteen slaves here.  They rose against their master  in the night, and thou seest how it ended.\"    \"Yes.  How did it begin?\"    \"There was no witness but the slaves.  They said the slave that  was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange  way--by magic arts 'twas thought, by reason that he had no key,  and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured.  When  the master discovered his loss, he was mad with despair, and threw  himself upon his people with his heavy stick, who resisted and  brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts  that brought him swiftly to his end.\"    \"This is dreadful.  It will go hard with the slaves, no doubt,  upon the trial.\"    \"Marry, the trial is over.\"    \"Over!\"    \"Would they be a week, think you--and the matter so simple?  They  were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it.\"    \"Why, I don't see how they could determine which were the guilty  ones in so short a time.\"    \"_Which_ ones?  Indeed, they considered not particulars like to that.  They condemned them in a body.  Wit ye not the law?--which men  say the Romans left behind them here when they went--that if one  slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it.\"    \"True.  I had forgotten.  And when will these die?\"    \"Belike within a four and twenty hours; albeit some say they will  wait a pair of days more, if peradventure they may find the missing  one meantime.\"    The missing one!  It made me feel uncomfortable.    \"Is it likely they will find him?\"    \"Before the day is spent--yes.  They seek him everywhere.  They  stand at the gates of the town, with certain of the slaves who  will discover him to them if he cometh, and none can pass out  but he will be first examined.\"    \"Might one see the place where the rest are confined?\"    \"The outside of it--yes.  The inside of it--but ye will not want  to see that.\"    I took the address of that prison for future reference and then  sauntered off.  At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to,  up a back street, I got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman  who might be going on a cold voyage, and bound up my face with  a liberal bandage, saying I had a toothache.  This concealed my  worst bruises.  It was a transformation.  I no longer resembled my  former self.  Then I struck out for that wire, found it and  followed it to its den.  It was a little room over a butcher's  shop--which meant that business wasn't very brisk in the telegraphic  line.  The young chap in charge was drowsing at his table.  I locked  the door and put the vast key in my bosom.  This alarmed the young  fellow, and he was going to make a noise; but I said:    \"Save your wind; if you open your mouth you are dead, sure.  Tackle  your instrument.  Lively, now!  Call Camelot.\"    \"This doth amaze me!  How should such as you know aught of such  matters as--\"    \"Call Camelot!  I am a desperate man.  Call Camelot, or get away  from the instrument and I will do it myself.\"    \"What--you?\"    \"Yes--certainly.  Stop gabbling.  Call the palace.\"    He made the call.    \"Now, then, call Clarence.\"    \"Clarence _who_?\"    \"Never mind Clarence who.  Say you want Clarence; you'll get  an answer.\"    He did so.  We waited five nerve-straining minutes--ten minutes  --how long it did seem!--and then came a click that was as familiar  to me as a human voice; for Clarence had been my own pupil.    \"Now, my lad, vacate!  They would have known _my_ touch, maybe,  and so your call was surest; but I'm all right now.\"    He vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen--but it didn't  win.  I used a cipher.  I didn't waste any time in sociabilities  with Clarence, but squared away for business, straight-off--thus:    \"The king is here and in danger.  We were captured and brought  here as slaves.  We should not be able to prove our identity  --and the fact is, I am not in a position to try.  Send a telegram  for the palace here which will carry conviction with it.\"    His answer came straight back:    \"They don't know anything about the telegraph; they haven't had  any experience yet, the line to London is so new.  Better not  venture that.  They might hang you.  Think up something else.\"    Might hang us!  Little he knew how closely he was crowding the  facts.  I couldn't think up anything for the moment.  Then an idea  struck me, and I started it along:    \"Send five hundred picked knights with Launcelot in the lead; and  send them on the jump.  Let them enter by the southwest gate, and  look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm.\"    The answer was prompt:    \"They shall start in half an hour.\"    \"All right, Clarence; now tell this lad here that I'm a friend  of yours and a dead-head; and that he must be discreet and say  nothing about this visit of mine.\"    The instrument began to talk to the youth and I hurried away.  I fell to ciphering.  In half an hour it would be nine o'clock.  Knights and horses in heavy armor couldn't travel very fast.  These would make the best time they could, and now that the ground  was in good condition, and no snow or mud, they would probably  make a seven-mile gait; they would have to change horses a couple  of times; they would arrive about six, or a little after; it would  still be plenty light enough; they would see the white cloth which  I should tie around my right arm, and I would take command.  We  would surround that prison and have the king out in no time.  It would be showy and picturesque enough, all things considered,  though I would have preferred noonday, on account of the more  theatrical aspect the thing would have.    Now, then, in order to increase the strings to my bow, I thought  I would look up some of those people whom I had formerly recognized,  and make myself known.  That would help us out of our scrape,  without the knights.  But I must proceed cautiously, for it was  a risky business.  I must get into sumptuous raiment, and it  wouldn't do to run and jump into it.  No, I must work up to it  by degrees, buying suit after suit of clothes, in shops wide apart,  and getting a little finer article with each change, until I should  finally reach silk and velvet, and be ready for my project.  So  I started.    But the scheme fell through like scat!  The first corner I turned,  I came plump upon one of our slaves, snooping around with a watchman.  I coughed at the moment, and he gave me a sudden look that bit right  into my marrow.  I judge he thought he had heard that cough before.  I turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter,  pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye.  Those  people had stopped, and were talking together and looking in at  the door.  I made up my mind to get out the back way, if there  was a back way, and I asked the shopwoman if I could step out  there and look for the escaped slave, who was believed to be in  hiding back there somewhere, and said I was an officer in disguise,  and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in  charge, and would she be good enough to step there and tell him  he needn't wait, but had better go at once to the further end of  the back alley and be ready to head him off when I rousted him out.    She was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated  murderers, and she started on the errand at once.  I slipped out  the back way, locked the door behind me, put the key in my pocket  and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable.    Well, I had gone and spoiled it again, made another mistake.  A double one, in fact.  There were plenty of ways to get rid of  that officer by some simple and plausible device, but no, I must  pick out a picturesque one; it is the crying defect of my character.  And then, I had ordered my procedure upon what the officer, being  human, would _naturally_ do; whereas when you are least expecting it,  a man will now and then go and do the very thing which it's _not_  natural for him to do.  The natural thing for the officer to do,  in this case, was to follow straight on my heels; he would find  a stout oaken door, securely locked, between him and me; before  he could break it down, I should be far away and engaged in slipping  into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me  into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling  law-dogs in Britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity  of character.  But instead of doing the natural thing, the officer  took me at my word, and followed my instructions.  And so, as I  came trotting out of that cul de sac, full of satisfaction with my  own cleverness, he turned the corner and I walked right into his  handcuffs.  If I had known it was a cul de sac--however, there  isn't any excusing a blunder like that, let it go.  Charge it up  to profit and loss.    Of course, I was indignant, and swore I had just come ashore from  a long voyage, and all that sort of thing--just to see, you know,  if it would deceive that slave.  But it didn't.  He knew me.  Then  I reproached him for betraying me.  He was more surprised than  hurt.  He stretched his eyes wide, and said:    \"What, wouldst have me let thee, of all men, escape and not hang  with us, when thou'rt the very _cause_ of"]]]
