[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#2)"],[1,"called the bush-rope by the wood-cutters, on account of its use  in hauling out the heaviest timber, has a singular appearance in the  forests of Demerara. Sometimes you see it nearly as thick as a man's  body, twisted like a corkscrew round the tallest trees and rearing its  head high above their tops. At other times three or four of them, like  strands in a cable, join tree and tree and branch and branch together.  Others, descending from on high, take root as soon as their extremity  touches the ground, and appear like shrouds and stays supporting the  mainmast of a line-of-battle ship; while others, sending out parallel,  oblique, horizontal and perpendicular shoots in all directions, put you  in mind of what travellers call a matted forest. Oftentimes a tree,  above a hundred feet high, uprooted by the whirlwind, is stopped in its  fall by these amazing cables of nature, and hence it is that you  account for the phenomenon of seeing trees not only vegetating, but  sending forth vigorous shoots, though far from their perpendicular, and  their trunks inclined to every degree from the meridian to the horizon.    Their heads remain firmly supported by the bush-rope; many of their  roots soon refix themselves in the earth, and frequently a strong shoot  will sprout out perpendicularly from near the root of the reclined  trunk, and in time become a fine tree. No grass grows under the trees  and few weeds, except in the swamps.    The high grounds are pretty clear of underwood, and with a cutlass to  sever the small bush-ropes it is not difficult walking among the trees.    The soil, chiefly formed by the fallen leaves and decayed trees, is  very rich and fertile in the valleys. On the hills it is little better  than sand. The rains seem to have carried away and swept into the  valleys every particle which Nature intended to have formed a mould.    Four-footed animals are scarce considering how very thinly these  forests are inhabited by men.    Several species of the animal commonly called tiger, though in reality  it approaches nearer to the leopard, are found here, and two of their  diminutives, named tiger-cats. The tapir, the lobba and deer afford  excellent food, and chiefly frequent the swamps and low ground near the  sides of the river and creeks.    In stating that four-footed animals are scarce, the peccari must be  excepted. Three or four hundred of them herd together and traverse the  wilds in all directions in quest of roots and fallen seeds. The Indians  mostly shoot them with poisoned arrows. When wounded they run about one  hundred and fifty paces; they then drop, and make wholesome food.    The red monkey, erroneously called the baboon, is heard oftener than it  is seen, while the common brown monkey, the bisa, and sacawinki rove  from tree to tree, and amuse the stranger as he journeys on.    A species of the polecat, and another of the fox, are destructive to  the Indian's poultry, while the opossum, the guana and salempenta  afford him a delicious morsel.    The small ant-bear, and the large one, remarkable for his long, broad,  bushy tail, are sometimes seen on the tops of the wood-ants' nests; the  armadillos bore in the sand-hills, like rabbits in a warren; and the  porcupine is now and then discovered in the trees over your head.    This, too, is the native country of the sloth. His looks, his gestures  and his cries all conspire to entreat you to take pity on him. These  are the only weapons of defence which Nature hath given him. While  other animals assemble in herds, or in pairs range through these  boundless wilds, the sloth is solitary and almost stationary; he cannot  escape from you. It is said his piteous moans make the tiger relent and  turn out of the way. Do not then level your gun at him or pierce him  with a poisoned arrow--he has never hurt one living creature. A few  leaves, and those of the commonest and coarsest kind, are all he asks  for his support. On comparing him with other animals you would say that  you could perceive deficiency, deformity and superabundance in his  composition. He has no cutting-teeth, and though four stomachs, he  still wants the long intestines of ruminating animals. He has only one  inferior aperture, as in birds. He has no soles to his feet nor has he  the power of moving his toes separately. His hair is flat, and puts you  in mind of grass withered by the wintry blast. His legs are too short;  they appear deformed by the manner in which they are joined to the  body, and when he is on the ground, they seem as if only calculated to  be of use in climbing trees. He has forty-six ribs, while the elephant  has only forty, and his claws are disproportionably long. Were you to  mark down, upon a graduated scale, the different claims to superiority  amongst the four-footed animals, this poor ill-formed creature's claim  would be the last upon the lowest degree.    Demerara yields to no country in the world in her wonderful and  beautiful productions of the feathered race. Here the finest precious  stones are far surpassed by the vivid tints which adorn the birds. The  naturalist may exclaim that Nature has not known where to stop in  forming new species and painting her requisite shades. Almost every one  of those singular and elegant birds described by Buffon as belonging to  Cayenne are to be met with in Demerara, but it is only by an  indefatigable naturalist that they are to be found.    The scarlet curlew breeds in innumerable quantities in the muddy  islands on the coasts of Pomauron; the egrets and crabiers in the same  place. They resort to the mud-flats at ebbing water, while thousands of  sandpipers and plovers, with here and there a spoonbill and flamingo,  are seen amongst them. The pelicans go farther out to sea, but return  at sundown to the courada-trees. The humming-birds are chiefly to be  found near the flowers at which each of the species of the genus is  wont to feed. The pie, the gallinaceous, the columbine and passerine  tribes resort to the fruit-bearing trees.    You never fail to see the common vulture where there is carrion. In  passing up the river there was an opportunity of seeing a pair of the  king of the vultures; they were sitting on the naked branch of a tree,  with about a dozen of the common ones with them. A tiger had killed a  goat the day before; he had been driven away in the act of sucking the  blood, and not finding it safe or prudent to return, the goat remained  in the same place where he had killed it; it had begun to putrefy, and  the vultures had arrived that morning to claim the savoury morsel.    At the close of day the vampires leave the hollow trees, whither they  had fled at the morning's dawn, and scour along the river's banks in  quest of prey. On waking from sleep the astonished traveller finds his  hammock all stained with blood. It is the vampire that hath sucked him.  Not man alone, but every unprotected animal, is exposed to his  depredations; and so gently does this nocturnal surgeon draw the blood  that, instead of being roused, the patient is lulled into a still  profounder sleep. There are two species of vampire in Demerara, and  both suck living animals: one is rather larger than the common bat, the  other measures above two feet from wing to wing extended.    Snakes are frequently met with in the woods betwixt the sea-coast and  the rock Saba, chiefly near the creeks and on the banks of the river.  They are large, beautiful and formidable. The rattlesnake seems partial  to a tract of ground known by the name of Canal Number-three: there the  effects of his poison will be long remembered.    The camoudi snake has been killed from thirty to forty feet long;  though not venomous, his size renders him destructive to the passing  animals. The Spaniards in the Oroonoque positively affirm that he grows  to the length of seventy or eighty feet and that he will destroy the  strongest and largest bull. His name seems to confirm this: there he is  called \"matatoro,\" which literally means \"bull-killer.\" Thus he may be  ranked amongst the deadly snakes, for it comes nearly to the same thing  in the end whether the victim dies by poison from the fangs, which  corrupts his blood and makes it stink horribly, or whether his body be  crushed to mummy, and swallowed by this hideous beast.    The whipsnake of a beautiful changing green, and the coral, with  alternate broad traverse bars of black and red, glide from bush to  bush, and may be handled with safety; they are harmless little  creatures.    The labarri snake is speckled, of a dirty brown colour, and can  scarcely be distinguished from the ground or stump on which he is  coiled up; he grows to the length of about eight feet and his bite  often proves fatal in a few minutes.    Unrivalled in his display of every lovely colour of the rainbow, and  unmatched in the effects of his deadly poison, the counacouchi glides  undaunted on, sole monarch of these forests; he is commonly known by  the name of the bush-master. Both man and beast fly before him, and  allow him to pursue an undisputed path. He sometimes grows to the  length of fourteen feet.    A few small caymen, from two to twelve feet long, may be observed now  and then in passing up and down the river; they just keep their heads  above the water, and a stranger would not know them from a rotten stump.    Lizards of the finest green, brown and copper colour, from two inches  to two feet and a half long, are ever and anon rustling among the  fallen leaves and crossing the path before you, whilst the chameleon is  busily employed in chasing insects round the trunks of the neighbouring  trees.    The fish are of many different sorts and well-tasted, but not,  generally speaking, very plentiful. It is probable that their numbers  are considerably thinned by the otters, which are much larger than  those of Europe. In going through the overflowed savannas, which have  all a communication with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#2)"],[1,"erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial  events (astrology), we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike  the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical  events. For, out of the scanty records which have survived the  destructive acts of fire and flood, of monarchs and mobs, we have  found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly  motions than was possible without these records.    So Hipparchus, about 150 B.C., and Ptolemy a little later, were able  to use the observations of Chaldaean astrologers, as well as those of  Alexandrian astronomers, and to make some discoveries which have  helped the progress of astronomy in all ages.  So, also, Mr. Cowell[2]  has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the Chaldaeans  for recording the eclipses of 1062 B.C. and 762 B.C.; and has thereby  been enabled, in the last few years, to correct the lunar tables of  Hansen, and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration  of the moon's longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could  be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the  highest precision.    So again, Mr. Hind [3] was enabled to trace back the period during  which Halley's comet has been a member of the solar system, and to  identify it in the Chinese observations of comets as far back as 12  B.C. Cowell and Cromellin extended the date to 240 B.C. In the same  way the comet 1861.i. has been traced back in the Chinese records to  617 A.D. [4]    The theoretical views founded on Newton's great law of universal  gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth's  equator to the plane of her orbit (the obliquity of the ecliptic) has  been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times; and this fact has  been confirmed by Egyptian and Chinese observations on the length of  the shadow of a vertical pillar, made thousands of years before the  Christian era, in summer and winter.    There are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions  of the ancients. The historian, wishing to give credit wherever it may  be due, is met by two difficulties. Firstly, only a few records of  very ancient astronomy are extant, and the authenticity of many of  these is open to doubt. Secondly, it is very difficult to divest  ourselves of present knowledge, and to appreciate the originality of  thought required to make the first beginnings.    With regard to the first point, we are generally dependent upon  histories written long after the events.  The astronomy of Egyptians,  Babylonians, and Assyrians is known to us mainly through the Greek  historians, and for information about the Chinese we rely upon the  researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent  times. The testimony of the Greek writers has fortunately been  confirmed, and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from  the original sculptures, papyri, and inscribed bricks, dating back  thousands of years.    In attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must  remember that it was natural to look upon the earth (as all the first  astronomers did) as a circular plane, surrounded and bounded by the  heaven, which was a solid vault, or hemisphere, with its concavity  turned downwards. The stars seemed to be fixed on this vault; the  moon, and later the planets, were seen to crawl over it. It was a  great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun  too. It must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars  are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night. It must  have been difficult to explain how the sun, having set in the west,  could get back to rise in the east without being seen _if_ it was  always the same sun. It was a great step to suppose the earth to be  spherical, and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation.  Probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the  placing of the sun, moon, and planets at different distances from the  earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven. It was a  transition from \"flatland\" to a space of three dimensions.    Great progress was made when systematic observations began, such as  following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars, and the  inferred motion of the sun among the stars, by observing their  _heliacal risings_--i.e., the times of year when a star  would first be seen to rise at sunrise, and when it could last be seen  to rise at sunset. The grouping of the stars into constellations and  recording their places was a useful observation. The theoretical  prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon, and of the motions of the  planets among the stars, became later the highest goal in astronomy.    To not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy  can we assign the author with certainty. Probably many of them were  independently taken by Chinese, Indian, Persian, Tartar, Egyptian,  Babylonian, Assyrian, Phoenician, and Greek astronomers.  And we have  not a particle of information about the discoveries, which may have  been great, by other peoples--by the Druids, the Mexicans, and the  Peruvians, for example.    We do know this, that all nations required to have a calendar. The  solar year, the lunar month, and the day were the units, and it is  owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars  proposed and in use at different times. The only object to be attained  by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual  dates of observations recorded, and this is not a part of a history of  astronomy.    In conclusion, let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the  ancients when we try to estimate their merit. Let us remember that the  first astronomy was of two dimensions; the second astronomy was of  three dimensions, but still purely geometrical. Since Kepler's day we  have had a dynamical astronomy.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Trans. R. S. E., xxiii. 1864, p. 499, _On Sun Spots_, etc., by  B. Stewart. Also Trans. R. S. 1860-70.

The last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of  assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development  of primitive notions about astronomy. The fact that some alleged  observations date back to a period before the Chinese had invented the  art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can  be trusted.    Our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far East by  travellers, and by the Jesuit priests, and was published in the  eighteenth century. The Asiatic Society of Bengal contributed  translations of Brahmin literature. The two principal sources of  knowledge about Chinese astronomy were supplied, first by Father  Souciet, who in 1729 published _Observations Astronomical,  Geographical, Chronological, and Physical_, drawn from ancient  Chinese books; and later by Father Moyriac-de-Mailla, who in 1777-1785  published _Annals of the Chinese Empire, translated from  Tong-Kien-Kang-Mou_.    Bailly, in his _Astronomie Ancienne_ (1781), drew, from these and  other sources, the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical  learning of the Chinese, Indians, Chaldaeans, Assyrians, and Egyptians  is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace  can be found.    Delambre, in his _Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne_ (1817),  ridicules the opinion of Bailly, and considers that the progress made  by all of these nations is insignificant.    It will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the  ancients not yet entirely discredited.  China and Babylon may be taken  as typical examples.    _China_.--It would appear that Fohi, the first emperor, reigned  about 2952 B.C., and shortly afterwards Yu-Chi made a sphere to  represent the motions of the celestial bodies. It is also mentioned,  in the book called Chu-King, supposed to have been written in 2205  B.C., that a similar sphere was made in the time of Yao (2357  B.C.).[1] It is said that the Emperor Chueni (2513 B.C.) saw five  planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in  conjunction. This is discussed by Father Martin (MSS. of De Lisle);  also by M. Desvignolles (Mem. Acad. Berlin, vol. iii., p. 193), and by  M. Kirsch (ditto, vol. v., p. 19), who both found that Mars, Jupiter,  Saturn, and Mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth  degrees of Pisces, all visible together in the evening on February  28th 2446 B.C., while on the same day the sun and moon were in  conjunction at 9 a.m., and that on March 1st the moon was in  conjunction with the other four planets. But this needs confirmation.    Yao, referred to above, gave instructions to his astronomers to  determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes, and they  reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at  these seasons, and in 2285 B.C. he gave them further orders. If this  account be true, it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a  complete sphere, and that stars are shining at mid-day, although  eclipsed by the sun's brightness.    It is also asserted, in the book called _Chu-King_, that in the  time of Yao the year was known to have 3651/4 days, and that he  adopted 365 days and added an intercalary day every four years (as in  the Julian Calendar). This may be true or not, but the ancient Chinese  certainly seem to have divided the circle "]]]
