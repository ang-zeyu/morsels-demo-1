I dare say they've come again now.\"    The girl went and she looked, and there was nothing but the dishes. So  back she came and says she: \"Noo, they ain't come again.\"    \"Not one of 'em?\" says the mother.    \"Not one of 'em,\" says she.    \"Well, come again, or not come again,\" said the woman \"I'll have one for  supper.\"    \"But you can't, if they ain't come,\" said the girl.    \"But I can,\" says she. \"Go you, and bring the best of 'em.\"    \"Best or worst,\" says the girl, \"I've ate 'em all, and you can't have  one till that's come again.\"    Well, the woman she was done, and she took her spinning to the door to  spin, and as she span she sang:      \"My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day.    My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day.\"    The king was coming down the street, and he heard her sing, but what she  sang he couldn't hear, so he stopped and said:    \"What was that you were singing, my good woman?\"    The woman was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been doing,  so she sang, instead of that:      \"My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day.    My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day.\"    \"Stars o' mine!\" said the king, \"I never heard tell of any one that  could do that.\"    Then he said: \"Look you here, I want a wife, and I'll marry your  daughter. But look you here,\" says he, \"eleven months out of the year  she shall have all she likes to eat, and all the gowns she likes to get,  and all the company she likes to keep; but the last month of the year  she'll have to spin five skeins every day, and if she don't I shall kill  her.\"    \"All right,\" says the woman; for she thought what a grand marriage that  was. And as for the five skeins, when the time came, there'd be plenty  of ways of getting out of it, and likeliest, he'd have forgotten all  about it.    Well, so they were married. And for eleven months the girl had all she  liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, and all the company  she liked to keep.    But when the time was getting over, she began to think about the skeins  and to wonder if he had 'em in mind. But not one word did he say about  'em, and she thought he'd wholly forgotten 'em.    However, the last day of the last month he takes her to a room she'd  never set eyes on before. There was nothing in it but a spinning-wheel  and a stool. And says he: \"Now, my dear, here you'll be shut in  to-morrow with some victuals and some flax, and if you haven't spun five  skeins by the night, your head'll go off.\"    And away he went about his business.    Well, she was that frightened, she'd always been such a gatless girl,  that she didn't so much as know how to spin, and what was she to do  to-morrow with no one to come nigh her to help her? She sat down on a  stool in the kitchen, and law! how she did cry!    However, all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on the  door. She upped and oped it, and what should she see but a small little  black thing with a long tail. That looked up at her right curious, and  that said:    \"What are you a-crying for?\"    \"What's that to you?\" says she.    \"Never you mind,\" that said, \"but tell me what you're a-crying for.\"    \"That won't do me no good if I do,\" says she.    \"You don't know that,\" that said, and twirled that's tail round.    \"Well,\" says she, \"that won't do no harm, if that don't do no good,\" and  she upped and told about the pies, and the skeins, and everything.    \"This is what I'll do,\" says the little black thing, \"I'll come to your  window every morning and take the flax and bring it spun at night.\"    \"What's your pay?\" says she.    That looked out of the corner of that's eyes, and that said: \"I'll  give you three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you haven't  guessed it before the month's up you shall be mine.\"    Well, she thought she'd be sure to guess that's name before the month  was up. \"All right,\" says she, \"I agree.\"    \"All right,\" that says, and law! how that twirled that's tail.    Well, the next day, her husband took her into the room, and there was  the flax and the day's food.    \"Now there's the flax,\" says he, \"and if that ain't spun up this night,  off goes your head.\" And then he went out and locked the door.    He'd hardly gone, when there was a knocking against the window.    She upped and she oped it, and there sure enough was the little old  thing sitting on the ledge.    \"Where's the flax?\" says he.    \"Here it be,\" says she. And she gave it to him.    Well, come the evening a knocking came again to the window. She upped  and she oped it, and there was the little old thing with five skeins of  flax on his arm.    \"Here it be,\" says he, and he gave it to her.    \"Now, what's my name?\" says he.    \"What, is that Bill?\" says she.    \"Noo, that ain't,\" says he, and he twirled his tail.    \"Is that Ned?\" says she.    \"Noo, that ain't,\" says he, and he twirled his tail.    \"Well, is that Mark?\" says she.    \"Noo, that ain't,\" says he, and he twirled his tail harder, and away he  flew.    Well, when her husband came in, there were the five skeins ready for  him. \"I see I shan't have to kill you to-night, my dear,\" says he;  \"you'll have your food and your flax in the morning,\" says he, and away  he goes.    Well, every day the flax and the food were brought, and every day that  there little black impet used to come mornings and evenings. And all the  day the girl sat trying to think of names to say to it when it came at  night. But she never hit on the right one. And as it got towards the  end of the month, the impet began to look so maliceful, and that twirled  that's tail faster and faster each time she gave a guess.    At last it came to the last day but one. The impet came at night along  with the five skeins, and that said,    \"What, ain't you got my name yet?\"    \"Is that Nicodemus?\" says she.    \"Noo, t'ain't,\" that says.    \"Is that Sammle?\" says she.    \"Noo, t'ain't,\" that says.    \"A-well, is that Methusalem?\" says she.    \"Noo, t'ain't that neither,\" that says.    Then that looks at her with that's eyes like a coal o' fire, and that  says: \"Woman, there's only to-morrow night, and then you'll be mine!\"  And away it flew.    Well, she felt that horrid. However, she heard the king coming along the  passage. In he came, and when he sees the five skeins, he says, says he,    \"Well, my dear,\" says he, \"I don't see but what you'll have your skeins  ready to-morrow night as well, and as I reckon I shan't have to kill  you, I'll have supper in here to-night.\" So they brought supper, and  another stool for him, and down the two sat.    Well, he hadn't eaten but a mouthful or so, when he stops and begins to  laugh.    \"What is it?\" says she.    \"A-why,\" says he, \"I was out a-hunting to-day, and I got away to a place  in the wood I'd never seen before And there was an old chalk-pit. And I  heard a kind of a sort of a humming. So I got off my hobby, and I went  right quiet to the pit, and I looked down. Well, what should there be  but the funniest little black thing you ever set eyes on. And what was  that doing, but that had a little spinning-wheel, and that was spinning  wonderful fast, and twirling that's tail. And as that span that sang:      \"Nimmy nimmy not    My name's Tom Tit Tot.\"    Well, when the girl heard this, she felt as if she could have jumped out  of her skin for joy, but she didn't say a word.    Next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for  the flax. And when night came, she heard that knocking against the  window panes. She oped the window, and that come right in on the ledge.  That was grinning from ear to ear, and Oo! that's tail was twirling  round so fast.    \"What's my name?\" that says, as that gave her the skeins.    \"Is that Solomon?\" she says, pretending to be afeard.    \"Noo, t'ain't,\" that says, and that came further into the room.    \"Well, is that Zebedee?\" says she again.    \"Noo, t'ain't,\" says the impet. And then that laughed and twirled that's  tail till you couldn't hardly see it.    \"Take time, woman,\" that says; \"next guess, and you're mine.\" And that  stretched out that's black hands at her.    Well, she backed a step or two, and she looked at it, and then she  laughed out, and says she, pointing her finger at it:    \"NIMMY NIMMY NOT, YOUR NAME'S TOM TIT TOT!\"    Well, when that heard her, that gave an awful shriek and away that flew  into the dark, and she never saw it any more.          THE THREE SILLIES    Once upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one daughter,  and she was courted by a gentleman. Every evening he used to come and  see her, and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and the daughter used to  be sent down into the cellar to draw the beer for supper. So one evening  she had gone down to draw the beer, and she happened to look up at the  ceiling while she was drawing, and she saw a mallet stuck in one of the  beams. It must have been there a long, long time, but somehow or other  she had never noticed it before, and she began a-thinking. And she  thought it was very dangerous to have that mallet there, for she said  to herself: \"Suppose him and me was to be married, and we was to have a  son, and he was to grow up to be a man, and come down into the cellar to  draw the beer, like as I'm doing now, and the mallet was to fall on his  head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!\" And she put down  the candle and the jug, and sat herself down and began a-crying.    Well, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long  drawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after her, and she  found her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer running over the  floor. \"Why, whatever is the matter?\" said her mother. \"Oh, mother!\"  says she, \"look at that horrid mallet! Suppose we was to be married, and  was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down to the  cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#2)"],[1,"ich, in his address to the reader, he lays down for the conversion of  Mohammedans, are dictated by sound sense and amiable feelings.  They are,  however, not calculated to satisfy those who think the sword and the fagot to  be the only proper instruments for the extirpation of heresy.  That he places  Islamism on an equality with Christianity is a gross falsehood.  \"As  Mohammed,\" says he, \"gave his Arabs the best religion he could, preferable, at  least, to those of the ancient pagan lawgivers, I confess I cannot see why he  deserves not equal respect, though not with Moses or Jesus Christ, whose laws  came really from heaven, yet with Minos or Numa, notwithstanding the  distinction of a learned writer, who seems to think it a greater crime to make  use of an imposture to set up a new religion, founded on the acknowledgment of  one true God, and to destroy idolatry, than to use the same means to gain  reception to rules and regulations for the more orderly practice of heathenism  already established.\"  This, and no more, is \"the very head and front of his  offending;\" and from this it would, I think, be difficult to extract any proof  of his belief in the divine mission of Mohammed.  If the charge brought  against him be not groundless, he must have added to his other sins that of  being a consummate hypocrite, and that, too, without any obvious necessity; he  having been, till the period of his decease, a member of the Society for the  Promoting of Christian Knowledge.     In 1736 a society was established for the encouragement of learning.  It  comprehended many noblemen, and some of the most eminent literary men of that  day.  Sale was one of the founders of it, and was appointed on the first  committee.  The meetings were held weekly, and the committee decided upon what  works should be printed at the expense of the society, or with its assistance,  and what should be the price of them.  When the cost of printing was repaid,  the property of the work reverted to the author.  This establishment did not,  I Imagine, exist for any length of time.  The attention of the public has been  recently called to a plan of a similar kind.     Sale did not long survive the carrying of this scheme into effect.  He died  of a fever, on the 13th of November, 1736, at his house in Surrey-street,  Strand, after an illness of only eight days, and was buried at St. Clement  Danes.  He was under the age of forty when he was thus suddenly snatched from  his family, which consisted of a wife and five children.  Of his sons, one was  educated at New College, Oxford, of which he became Fellow, and he was  subsequently elected to a Fellow-ship in Winchester College.  Sale is  described as having had \"a healthy constitution, and a communicative mind in a  comely person.\"  His library was valuable, and contained many rare and  beautiful manuscripts in the Persian, Turkish, Arabic, and other languages; a  circumstance which seems to show that poverty, so often the lot of men whose  lives are devoted to literary pursuits, was not one of the evils with which he  was compelled to encounter.           R. A. DAVENPORT.    [from 1891 version]          INTRODUCTION    THERE is surely no need to-day to insist on the importance of a close study of  the Korân for all who would comprehend the many vital problems connected with  the Islamic World; and yet few of us, I imagine, among the many who possess  translations of this book have been at pains to read it through.  It must,  however, be borne in mind that the Korân plays a far greater rôle among the  Muhammadans than does the Bible in Christianity in that it provides not only  the canon of their faith, but also the text-book of their ritual and the  principles of their Civil Law.   It was the Great Crusades that first brought the West into close touch  with Islam, but between the years 1096 and 1270 we only hear of one attempt to  make known to Europe the Sacred Book of the Moslems, namely, the Latin version  made in 1143, by Robert of Retina (who, Sale tells us, was an Englishman), and  Hermann of Dalmatia, on the initiative of Petrus Venerabilis, the Abbot of  Clugny, which version was ultimately printed by T. Bibliander in Basel in  1543, nearly a hundred years after the fall of Constantinople.   During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several translations  appeared both in Latin and in French, and one of the latter, by André du Ryer,  was translated into English by Alexander Ross in 1649.  But by far the most  important work on the Korân was that of Luigi Marracci which was published in  Padua in 1698.   George Sale's translation first appeared in November, 1734, in a quarto  volume; in 1764 it was first printed in medium octavo, and the reprint of 1825  contained the sketch of Sale's life by Richard Alfred Davenant which has been  utilized in the article on Sale in the Dictionary of National Bibliography.  The Chandos Classics edition in crown octavo was first issued in 1877.   Soon after the death of the Prophet, early Muhammadan theologians began  to discuss, not only the correct reading of the text itself, but also to work  out on the basis of first-hand reports the story connected with the revelation  of each chapter.  As the book at present stands in its original form the  chapters are arranged more or less according to their respective length,  beginning with the longest; except in the case of the opening chapter, which  holds a place by itself, not only in the sacred book of Islam, corresponding  as it does in a manner to our Pater Noster, but also in its important  ceremonial usages.  The presumed order in which the various chapters were  revealed is given in the tabular list of Contents, but it may be mentioned  that neither Muhammadan theologians, nor, in more recent times, European  scholars, are in entire agreement upon the exact chronological position of all  the chapters.   It is well for all who study the Korân to realize that the actual text  is never the composition of the Prophet, but is the word of God addressed to  the Prophet; and that in quoting the Korân the formula is \"He (may he be  exalted) said\" or some such phrase.  The Prophet himself is of course quoted  by Muhammadan theologians, but such quotations refer to his traditional  sayings known as \"Hadîs,\" which have been handed down from mouth to mouth with  the strictest regard to genealogical continuity.   It would probably be impossible for any Arabic scholar to produce a  translation of the Korân which would defy criticism, but this much may be said  of Sale's version: just as, when it first appeared, it had no rival in the  field, it may be fairly claimed to-day that it has been superseded by no  subsequent translations.  Equally remarkable with his translation is the  famous Preliminary Discourse which constitutes a tour de force when we  consider how little critical work had been done in his day in the field of  Islamic research.  Practically the only works of first-class importance were  Dr. Pocock's Specimen Historio Arabum, to which, in his original Address to  the Reader, Sale acknowledges his great indebtedness, and Maracci's Korân.   In spite of the vast number of eminent scholars who have worked in the  same field since the days of George Sale, his Preliminary Discourse still  remains the best Introduction in any European language to the study of the  religion promulgated by the Prophet of Arabia; but as Wherry says: \"Whilst  reading the Preliminary Discourse as a most masterly, and on the whole  reliable, presentation of the peculiar doctrines, rites, ceremonies, customs,  and institutions of Islam, we recognize the fact that modern research has  brought to light many things concerning the history of the ancient Arabs which  greatly modify the statements made in the early paragraphs.\"   For many centuries the acquaintance which the majority of Europeans  possessed of Muhammadanism was based almost entirely on distorted reports of  fanatical Christians which led to the dissemination of a multitude of gross  calumnies.  What was good in Muhammadanism was entirely ignored, and what was  not good, in the eyes of Europe, was exaggerated or misinterpreted.   It must not, however, be forgotten that the central doctrine preached by  Muhammad to his contemporaries in Arabia, who worshipped the Stars; to the  Persians, who acknowledged Ormuz and Ahriman; the Indians, who worshipped  idols; and the Turks, who had no particular worship, was the unity of God, and  that the simplicity of his creed was probably a more potent factor in the  spread of Islam than the sword of the Ghazis.   Islam, although seriously affecting the Christian world, brought a  spiritual religion to one half of Asia, and it is an amazing circumstance that  the Turks, who on several occasions let loose their Central Asian hordes over  India, and the Middle East, though irresistible in the onslaught of their  arms, were all conquered in their turn by the Faith of Islam, and founded  Muhammadan dynasties.   The Mongols of the thirteenth century did their best to wipe out all  traces of Islam when they sacked Baghdad, but though the Caliphate was  relegated to obscurity in Egypt the newly founded Empires quickly became  Muhammadan states, until finally it was a Turk who took the title of Caliph  which has been held by the house of Othman ever since.   Thus through all the vicissitudes of thirteen hundred years the Korân  has remained the sacred book of all the Turks and Persians and of nearly a  quarter of the population of India.  Surely such a book as this deserves to be  widely read in the West, more especially in these days when space and time  have been almost annihilated by modern invention, and when public interest  embraces the whole world.   It is difficult to decide to what extent Sale's citations in the notes  represent first-hand use of the Arabic commentators, but I fear that the  result of a close inquiry only"]]]
