FACTS ABOUT THE WRECK OF THE TITANIC    NUMBER of persons aboard, 2340. Number of life-boats and rafts, 20.  Capacity of each life-boat, 50 passengers and crew of 8. Utmost capacity  of life-boats and rafts, about 1100. Number of life-boats wrecked in  launching, 4. Capacity of life-boats safely launched, 928. Total number  of persons taken in life-boats, 711. Number who died in life-boats, 6.  Total number saved, 705. Total number of Titanic's company lost, 1635.    The cause of the disaster was a collision with an iceberg in latitude  41.46 north, longitude 50.14 west. The Titanic had had repeated warnings  of the presence of ice in that part of the course. Two official warnings  had been received defining the position of the ice fields. It had been  calculated on the Titanic that she would reach the ice fields about 11  o'clock Sunday night. The collision occurred at 11.40. At that time the  ship was driving at a speed of 21 to 23 knots, or about 26 miles, an  hour.    There had been no details of seamen assigned to each boat.    Some of the boats left the ship without seamen enough to man the oars.    Some of the boats were not more than half full of passengers.    The boats had no provisions, some of them had no water stored, some were  without sail equipment or compasses.    In some boats, which carried sails wrapped and bound, there was not a  person with a knife to cut the ropes. In some boats the plugs in the  bottom had been pulled out and the women passengers were compelled to  thrust their hands into the holes to keep the boats from filling and  sinking.    The captain, E. J. Smith, admiral of the White Star fleet, went down  with his ship.        CHAPTER I. FIRST NEWS OF THE GREATEST MARINE DISASTER IN HISTORY    \"THE TITANIC IN COLLISION, BUT EVERYBODY SAFE\"--ANOTHER TRIUMPH SET  DOWN TO WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY--THE WORLD GOES TO SLEEP PEACEFULLY--THE SAD  AWAKENING.    LIKE a bolt out of a clear sky came the wireless message on Monday,  April 15, 1912, that on Sunday night the great Titanic, on her maiden  voyage across the Atlantic, had struck a gigantic iceberg, but that  all the passengers were saved. The ship had signaled her distress and  another victory was set down to wireless. Twenty-one hundred lives  saved!    Additional news was soon received that the ship had collided with a  mountain of ice in the North Atlantic, off Cape Race, Newfoundland, at  10.25 Sunday evening, April 14th. At 4.15 Monday morning the Canadian  Government Marine Agency received a wireless message that the Titanic  was sinking and that the steamers towing her were trying to get her into  shoal water near Cape Race, for the purpose of beaching her.    Wireless despatches up to noon Monday showed that the passengers of the  Titanic were being transferred aboard the steamer Carpathia, a Cunarder,  which left New York, April 13th, for Naples. Twenty boat-loads of the  Titanic's passengers were said to have been transferred to the Carpathia  then, and allowing forty to sixty persons as the capacity of each  life-boat, some 800 or 1200 persons had already been transferred from  the damaged liner to the Carpathia. They were reported as being taken to  Halifax, whence they would be sent by train to New York.    Another liner, the Parisian, of the Allan Company, which sailed from  Glasgow for Halifax on April 6th, was said to be close at hand and  assisting in the work of rescue. The Baltic, Virginian and Olympic were  also near the scene, according to the information received by wireless.    While badly damaged, the giant vessel was reported as still afloat, but  whether she could reach port or shoal water was uncertain. The White  Star officials declared that the Titanic was in no immediate danger of  sinking, because of her numerous water-tight compartments.    \"While we are still lacking definite information,\" Mr. Franklin,  vice-president of the White Star Line, said later in the afternoon, \"we  believe the Titanic's passengers will reach Halifax, Wednesday evening.  We have received no further word from Captain Haddock, of the Olympic,  or from any of the ships in the vicinity, but are confident that there  will be no loss of life.\"    With the understanding that the survivors would be taken to Halifax the  line arranged to have thirty Pullman cars, two diners and many passenger  coaches leave Boston Monday night for Halifax to get the passengers  after they were landed. Mr. Franklin made a guess that the Titanic's  passengers would get into Halifax on Wednesday. The Department of  Commerce and Labor notified the White Star Line that customs and  immigration inspectors would be sent from Montreal to Halifax in  order that there would be as little delay as possible in getting the  passengers on trains.    Monday night the world slept in peace and assurance. A wireless message  had finally been received, reading:    \"All Titanic's passengers safe.\"    It was not until nearly a week later that the fact was discovered that  this message had been wrongly received in the confusion of messages  flashing through the air, and that in reality the message should have  read:    \"Are all Titanic's passengers safe?\"    With the dawning of Tuesday morning came the awful news of the true fate  of the Titanic.        CHAPTER II. THE MOST SUMPTUOUS PALACE AFLOAT    DIMENSIONS OF THE TITANIC--CAPACITY--PROVISIONS FOR THE COMFORT AND  ENTERTAINMENT OF PASSENGERS--MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT THE ARMY OF ATTENDANTS  REQUIRED.    THE statistical record of the great ship has news value at this time.    Early in 1908 officials of the White Star Company announced that they  would eclipse all previous records in shipbuilding with a vessel of  staggering dimensions. The Titanic resulted.    The keel of the ill-fated ship was laid in the summer of 1909 at the  Harland & Wolff yards, Belfast. Lord Pirrie, considered one of the  best authorities on shipbuilding in the world, was the designer. The  leviathan was launched on May 31, 1911, and was completed in February,  1912, at a cost of $10,000,000.      SISTER SHIP OF OLYMPIC    The Titanic, largest liner in commission, was a sister ship of the  Olympic. The registered tonnage of each vessel is estimated as 45,000,  but officers of the White Star Line say that the Titanic measured 45,328  tons. The Titanic was commanded by Captain E. J. Smith, the White Star  admiral, who had previously been on the Olympic.    She was 882 1/2 long, or about four city blocks, and was 5000 tons  bigger than a battleship twice as large as the dreadnought Delaware.    Like her sister ship, the Olympic, the Titanic was a four-funneled  vessel, and had eleven decks. The distance from the keel to the top of  the funnels was 175 feet. She had an average speed of twenty-one knots.    The Titanic could accommodate 2500 passengers. The steamship was divided  into numerous compartments, separated by fifteen bulkheads. She was  equipped with a gymnasium, swimming pool, hospital with operating room,  and a grill and palm garden.      CARRIED CREW OF 860    The registered tonnage was 45,000, and the displacement tonnage 66,000.  She was capable of carrying 2500 passengers and the crew numbered 860.    The largest plates employed in the hull were 36 feet long, weighing 43  1/2 tons each, and the largest steel beam used was 92 feet long, the  weight of this double beam being 4 tons. The rudder, which was operated  electrically, weighed 100 tons, the anchors 15 1/2 tons each, the center  (turbine) propeller 22 tons, and each of the two \"wing\" propellers 38  tons each. The after \"boss-arms,\" from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#2)"],[1,"took temporary  possession of the naiads' dressing-room, and in the course of a few  minutes more were revelling in a swim. The red rubber caps of the girls  who preceded them were plainly to be seen some distance from the shore,  where their owners were apparently having a race towards a rock that  jutted from the waves.    \"Oh, they _mustn't_ go out there! There's an awful current! Bevis  warned us about it!\" gasped Mavis, swimming securely with one foot on the  ground. \"Can't we stop them? Shout, Merle!\"    \"Hello, there! Ahoy! Come back!\" yelled Merle, who possessed stronger  lungs than her sister. \"They don't hear me! Coo-oo-ee! That's done it,  thank goodness! Come--back--you're--going--to--get--into--a--current!\"    The two red caps, warned in time of their danger, turned and swam into  safer waters. They did not venture so far again from the shore, but  frolicked with some companions, trying to make wheels and to perform  various other feats of agility, which were generally failures and ended  in a splash. They were so long about it that Mavis and Merle went from  the water first and had time to dress quite leisurely before the others,  shaking out wet fair hair, followed to the crevice among the rocks.    The Ramsays took their picnic basket, and, climbing a short way up the  steps, settled themselves upon a grassy platform which afforded a good  view of the cove below. They liked this vantage-ground better than the  sands, and began to spread out the cups and saucers and parcels of cakes  which Jessop had packed for them, congratulating themselves upon having a  spot at least fairly apart. But they were not destined to spend that  afternoon in solitary state. They had scarcely opened their basket when  three heads came bobbing up the steps, shamelessly invaded their  platform, and also began to unpack tea-cups.    Merle, who did not like other people to trespass upon her rights, frowned  and turned her back upon them, and probably each little party would have  taken its meal separately had not an unforeseen and utterly untoward  accident happened. Mavis knocked their thermos flask with her elbow and  sent it spinning over the cliff. Here was a pretty business! Their tea  was gone, and the flask, if they found it, would be utterly smashed.    \"It's not worth climbing down to pick it up!\" lamented Mavis contritely.  \"I'm so sorry, Merle! It was horribly clumsy of me!\"    \"Do have some of ours!\" suggested one of the strangers sympathetically.  \"We've heaps! Two flasks; and that's more than we shall drink ourselves.  You might just as well!\"    \"I say, it was awfully decent of you to call to us not to go on to those  rocks!\" put in another. \"We didn't know about the current.\"    The third girl made no remark, but she smiled invitingly and held out one  of their flasks.    So it came about that Mavis and Merle moved nearer and joined the others,  so that they formed one party. For a few minutes they sat in polite  silence, taking in the items of their neighbours' appearance. When the  Ramsays compared notes afterwards they decided that they had never before  seen three such pretty girls. The two who had worn the red bathing caps  were evidently sisters, for they had the same clear-cut features, fair  complexions, cupid mouths, and beautiful dark-fringed eyes. Their  companion, whose brown hair was drying in the breeze, was a complete  contrast, with her warm brunette colouring and quick vivacious manner,  \"like an orchid between two roses,\" as Mavis described her later. It was  she who spoke first--quite a conventional inquiry but decidedly to the  point.    \"Are you staying in Chagmouth?\" she asked.    \"We've only come over for the day from Durracombe,\" answered Merle.    The three strangers looked immediately interested.    \"Durracombe! Why, we're going to start school there next week!\"    \"Never at 'The Moorings'!\" gasped Merle excitedly.    \"That's the place! Do you go there too? Oh! I say! Do tell us all about  it! We've been just crazy to know what it's like. You two look sports!  What are your names? Are the rest of the school jolly, and is Miss  Pollard nice?\"    With such a common interest as 'The Moorings' to talk about, the ice was  completely broken, and the five girls were soon chatting in friendly  fashion.    Mavis and Merle, having given a few details about themselves and how they  often motored over to Chagmouth with Dr. Tremayne, drew in turn some  information from their new acquaintances. The two fair-haired girls, aged  respectively fourteen and thirteen, were Beata and Romola Castleton, and  their father, an artist, had lately removed from Porthkeverne in  Cornwall, and had taken a house at Chagmouth. Their friend Fay Macleod, a  year older than Beata, was an American, whose father had come to Europe  in search of health, and being attracted to Chagmouth by his love of  sketching, had settled there temporarily for a rest-cure, and was  enjoying the quiet and beauty of the quaint place and its surrounding  scenery.    \"I suppose you'll all be weekly boarders?\" ventured Mavis, when Fay had  finished her communications.    \"No, we're to be day-girls. Six of us from Chagmouth are joining in a car  and motoring every morning and being fetched back at four--ourselves, Nan  and Lizzie Colville, and Tattie Carew. It will be rather a squash to cram  six of us into Vicary's car! We've named it 'the sardine-tin' already. I  hope nobody else will want to join us!\"    \"Babbie Williams is to be a day-girl this term. She lives over there at  The Warren.\"    \"We haven't room for her.\"    \"She's going in their own car.\"    \"That's good news for the sardines! I was thinking some of us would have  to ride on the footboard or the luggage-carrier. Is Babbie fair, with  bobbed hair? Then I've seen her in church. Seven of us from Chagmouth! We  ought to make quite a clique in the school!\"    \"Oh, we don't want any cliques,\" said Merle quickly. \"We had enough of  that sort of thing when Opal was there. Miss Pollard told mother that the  new mistress, Miss Mitchell, is going to reorganise everything, and bring  it up to date, so I expect we shall find a great many changes when we  start again. Have you been at school before?\"    \"Romola and I went to The Gables at Porthkeverne,\" replied Beata. \"We  loved it, and we were dreadfully sorry to leave. Fay, of course, has been  at school in America.\"    \"And we used to go to a big High school in the north until we came to  Durracombe. 'The Moorings' seemed a tiny place at first, and then we grew  to love it. We adore Miss Pollard and Miss Fanny. I hope you'll like them  too! I'm so glad we've met you, because we'll know you when you arrive at  school, and we can show you round. I'm afraid we shall have to be going  now, because Uncle David will be back from the sanatorium and waiting for  us. Thanks most immensely for the tea. We'll look out for you on Tuesday.  Good-bye!\"    As Mavis and Merle walked back along the cliffs to Chagmouth their  tongues wagged fast in discussion of their new acquaintances. Mavis was  charmed with Beata and Romola, and Merle had utterly lost her heart to  Fay.    \"I feel as if I could like her!\" she declared. \"She's a sport, and really  we want somebody to wake us up a little at 'The Moorings.' I believe this  term is going to be jolly. My spirits are rising and I see fun ahead. I  only wish Daddy could go and live at Chagmouth and _we_ could go to  school every day in 'the sardine-tin.' They'll have the time of their  lives, the luckers! Don't I envy them, just!\"    \"I don't think I'd like to be packed quite so tight, thanks!\" objected  Mavis. \"On the whole, I much prefer going backwards and forwards to  Chagmouth in Uncle David's car. Merle! Do you know it's after five! We  must simply scoot--oh, I daresay I did promise you might eat  blackberries, but you haven't time now. You shouldn't have stayed so long  at the cove if you wanted a blackberry feed! If you don't hurry up I  shall run off and leave you and go home with Uncle David by myself!  There! Oh, you're coming! Good! I thought you'd hardly care to spend the  night upon the cliffs with the sea-gulls!\"          CHAPTER II    A School Ballot      Mavis and Merle started for school on Tuesday morning confident of  finding many changes. Hitherto 'The Moorings' had been a modest  establishment where about twenty-four children had been educated by Miss  Pollard and her sister Miss Fanny, who were the daughters of the late  Vicar of the parish. They were neither of them particularly learned or up  to date, but they had a happy knack with girls, and had been especially  successful in the care of delicate pupils. The remarkably mild climate of  Durracombe made the place peculiarly suitable for those who had been born  in India or other hot countries, and so many more boarders had been  entered for this term that the school was practically doubled.  Recognising the fact that this sudden enlargement in numbers ought also  to mean a march forward in other ways, the sisters were wise enough to  seize their golden opportunity and completely reorganise their methods.  They were fortunate in being able to get hold of the house next to their  own, and, turning that into a hostel for boarders, they devoted the whole  of 'The Moorings' to classrooms. They engaged a thoroughly competent and  reliable mistress, with a university degree and High School experience,  and gave her _carte blanche_ to revise the curriculum and institute  what innovations she thought fit. They allowed her to choose her own  assistant mistress, and made fresh arrangements for visiting teachers,  reserving for themselves only a very few of the classes, and  concentrating most of their energies on the management of the hostel.  These new plans gave great satisfaction to both parents and pupils.    \"It will be rather nice to have somebody modern at the head of things, so  long as Miss Pollard and Miss Fanny aren't"]]]
