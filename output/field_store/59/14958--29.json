[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#2)"],[1," toward the center, where a big hole had been made in the  ocean--a hole with walls of water that were kept in place by the rapid  whirling of the air.    The boat in which Trot and Cap'n Bill were riding was just on the outer  edge of this saucer-like slant, and the old sailor knew very well that  unless he could quickly force the little craft away from the rushing  current they would soon be drawn into the great black hole that yawned  in the middle. So he exerted all his might and pulled as he had never  pulled before. He pulled so hard that the left oar snapped in two and  sent Cap'n Bill sprawling upon the bottom of the boat.    He scrambled up quickly enough and glanced over the side. Then he  looked at Trot, who sat quite still, with a serious, far-away look in  her sweet eyes. The boat was now speeding swiftly of its own accord,  following the line of the circular basin round and round and gradually  drawing nearer to the great hole in the center. Any further effort to  escape the whirlpool was useless, and realizing this fact Cap'n Bill  turned toward Trot and put an arm around her, as if to shield her from  the awful fate before them.  He did not try to speak, because the roar  of the waters would have drowned the sound of his voice.    These two faithful comrades had faced dangers before, but nothing to  equal that which now faced them. Yet Cap'n Bill, noting the look in  Trot's eyes and remembering how often she had been protected by unseen  powers, did not quite give way to despair.    The great hole in the dark water--now growing nearer and nearer--looked  very terrifying; but they were both brave enough to face it and await  the result of the adventure.          Chapter Two    The Cavern Under the Sea      The circles were so much smaller at the bottom of the basin, and the  boat moved so much more swiftly, that Trot was beginning to get dizzy  with the motion, when suddenly the boat made a leap and dived headlong  into the murky depths of the hole. Whirling like tops, but still  clinging together, the sailor and the girl were separated from their  boat and plunged down--down--down--into the farthermost recesses of the  great ocean.    At first their fall was swift as an arrow, but presently they seemed to  be going more moderately and Trot was almost sure that unseen arms were  about her, supporting her and protecting her. She could see nothing,  because the water filled her eyes and blurred her vision, but she clung  fast to Cap'n Bill's sou'wester, while other arms clung fast to her,  and so they gradually sank down and down until a full stop was made,  when they began to ascend again.    But it seemed to Trot that they were not rising straight to the surface  from where they had come. The water was no longer whirling them and  they seemed to be drawn in a slanting direction through still, cool  ocean depths. And then--in much quicker time than I have told it--up  they popped to the surface and were cast at full length upon a sandy  beach, where they lay choking and gasping for breath and wondering what  had happened to them.    Trot was the first to recover. Disengaging herself from Cap'n Bill's  wet embrace and sitting up, she rubbed the water from her eyes and then  looked around her.  A soft, bluish-green glow lighted the place, which  seemed to be a sort of cavern, for above and on either side of her were  rugged rocks. They had been cast upon a beach of clear sand, which  slanted upward from the pool of water at their feet--a pool which  doubtless led into the big ocean that fed it. Above the reach of the  waves of the pool were more rocks, and still more and more, into the  dim windings and recesses of which the glowing light from the water did  not penetrate.    The place looked grim and lonely, but Trot was thankful that she was  still alive and had suffered no severe injury during her trying  adventure under water. At her side Cap'n Bill was sputtering and  coughing, trying to get rid of the water he had swallowed. Both of them  were soaked through, yet the cavern was warm and comfortable and a  wetting did not dismay the little girl in the least.    She crawled up the slant of sand and gathered in her hand a bunch of  dried seaweed, with which she mopped the face of Cap'n Bill and cleared  the water from his eyes and ears. Presently the old man sat up and  stared at her intently. Then he nodded his bald head three times and  said in a gurgling voice:    \"Mighty good, Trot; mighty good! We didn't reach Davy Jones's locker  that time, did we? Though why we didn't, an' why we're here, is more'n  I kin make out.\"    \"Take it easy, Cap'n,\" she replied. \"We're safe enough, I guess, at  least for the time being.\"    He squeezed the water out of the bottoms of his loose trousers and felt  of his wooden leg and arms and head, and finding he had brought all of  his person with him he gathered courage to examine closely their  surroundings.    \"Where d'ye think we are, Trot?\" he presently asked.    \"Can't say, Cap'n. P'r'aps in one of our caves.\"    He shook his head. \"No,\" said he, \"I don't think that, at all.  The  distance we came up didn't seem half as far as the distance we went  down; an' you'll notice there ain't any outside entrance to this cavern  whatever. It's a reg'lar dome over this pool o' water, and unless  there's some passage at the back, up yonder, we're fast pris'ners.\"    Trot looked thoughtfully over her shoulder.    \"When we're rested,\" she said, \"we will crawl up there and see if  there's a way to get out.\"    Cap'n Bill reached in the pocket of his oilskin coat and took out his  pipe. It was still dry, for he kept it in an oilskin pouch with his  tobacco. His matches were in a tight tin box, so in a few moments the  old sailor was smoking contentedly. Trot knew it helped him to think  when he was in any difficulty. Also, the pipe did much to restore the  old sailor's composure, after his long ducking and his terrible  fright--a fright that was more on Trot's account than his own.    The sand was dry where they sat, and soaked up the water that dripped  from their clothing. When Trot had squeezed the wet out of her hair she  began to feel much like her old self again. By and by they got upon  their feet and crept up the incline to the scattered boulders above.  Some of these were of huge size, but by passing between some and around  others, they were able to reach the extreme rear of the cavern.    \"Yes,\" said Trot, with interest, \"here's a round hole.\"    \"And it's black as night inside it,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.    \"Just the same,\" answered the girl, \"we ought to explore it, and see  where it goes, 'cause it's the only poss'ble way we can get out of this  place.\"    Cap'n Bill eyed the hole doubtfully    \"It may be a way out o' here, Trot,\" he said, \"but it may be a way into  a far worse place than this. I'm not sure but our best plan is to stay  right here.\"    Trot wasn't sure, either, when she thought of it in that light. After  awhile she made her way back to the sands again, and Cap'n Bill  followed her. As they sat down, the child looked thoughtfully at the  sailor's bulging pockets.    \"How much food have we got, Cap'n?\" she asked.    \"Half a dozen ship's biscuits an' a hunk o' cheese,\" he replied. \"Want  some now, Trot?\"    She shook her head, saying:    \"That ought to keep us alive 'bout three days if we're careful of it.\"    \"Longer'n that, Trot,\" said Cap'n Bill, but his voice was a little  troubled and unsteady.    \"But if we stay here we're bound to starve in time,\" continued the  girl, \"while if we go into the dark hole--\"    \"Some things are more hard to face than starvation,\" said the  sailor-man, gravely. \"We don't know what's inside that dark hole: Trot,  nor where it might lead us to.\"    \"There's a way to find that out,\" she persisted.    Instead of replying, Cap'n Bill began searching in his pockets. He soon  drew out a little package of fish-hooks and a long line. Trot watched  him join them together. Then he crept a little way up the slope and  turned over a big rock. Two or three small crabs began scurrying away  over the sands and the old sailor caught them and put one on his hook  and the others in his pocket. Coming back to the pool he swung the hook  over his shoulder and circled it around his head and cast it nearly  into the center of the water, where he allowed it to sink gradually,  paying out the line as far as it would go. When the end was reached, he  began drawing it in again, until the crab bait was floating on the  surface.    Trot watched him cast the line a second time, and a third. She decided  that either there were no fishes in the pool or they would not bite the  crab bait. But Cap'n Bill was an old fisherman and not easily  discouraged. When the crab got away he put another on the hook. When  the crabs were all gone he climbed up the rocks and found some more.    Meantime Trot tired of watching him and lay down upon the sands, where  she fell fast asleep. During the next two hours her clothing dried  completely, as did that of the old sailor. They were both so used to  salt water that there was no danger of taking cold.    Finally the little girl was wakened by a splash beside her and a grunt  of satisfaction from Cap'n Bill. She opened her eyes to find that the  Cap'n had landed a silver-scaled fish weighing about two pounds. This  cheered her considerably and she hurried to scrape together a heap of  seaweed, while Cap'n Bill cut up the fish with his jackknife and got it  ready for cooking.    They had cooked fish with seaweed before. Cap'n Bill wrapped his fish  in some of the weed and dipped it in the water to dampen it. Then he  lighted a match and set fire to Trot's heap, which speedily burned down  to a glowing bed of ashes. Then they laid the wrapped fish on the  ashes, covered it with more seaweed, and allowed this to catch fire and  burn to embers. After feeding the fire with seaweed for some time, the  sailor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#2)"],[1,"the evening before and had gone to her own rooms.    \"She didn't say anything las' night about going anywhere,\" observed  little Trot.    \"No, and that's the strange part of it,\" replied Dorothy.  \"Usually  Ozma lets us know of everything she does.\"    \"Why not look in the Magic Picture?\" suggested Betsy Bobbin.  \"That  will tell us where she is in just one second.\"    \"Of course!\" cried Dorothy.  \"Why didn't I think of that before?\"  And  at once the three girls hurried away to Ozma's boudoir, where the Magic  Picture always hung.  This wonderful Magic Picture was one of the royal  Ozma's greatest treasures.  There was a large gold frame in the center  of which was a bluish-gray canvas on which various scenes constantly  appeared and disappeared.  If one who stood before it wished to see  what any person anywhere in the world was doing, it was only necessary  to make the wish and the scene in the Magic Picture would shift to the  scene where that person was and show exactly what he or she was then  engaged in doing.  So the girls knew it would be easy for them to wish  to see Ozma, and from the picture they could quickly learn where she  was.    Dorothy advanced to the place where the picture was usually protected  by thick satin curtains and pulled the draperies aside.  Then she  stared in amazement, while her two friends uttered exclamations of  disappointment.    The Magic Picture was gone. Only a blank space on the wall behind the  curtains showed where it had formerly hung.          CHAPTER 2    THE TROUBLES OF GLINDA THE GOOD      That same morning there was great excitement in the castle of the  powerful Sorceress of Oz, Glinda the Good.  This castle, situated in  the Quadling Country, far south of the Emerald City where Ozma ruled,  was a splendid structure of exquisite marbles and silver grilles. Here  the Sorceress lived, surrounded by a bevy of the most beautiful maidens  of Oz, gathered from all the four countries of that fairyland as well  as from the magnificent Emerald City itself, which stood in the place  where the four countries cornered.  It was considered a great honor to  be allowed to serve the good Sorceress, whose arts of magic were used  only to benefit the Oz people.  Glinda was Ozma's most valued servant,  for her knowledge of sorcery was wonderful, and she could accomplish  almost anything that her mistress, the lovely girl Ruler of Oz, wished  her to.    Of all the magical things which surrounded Glinda in her castle, there  was none more marvelous than her Great Book of Records.  On the pages  of this Record Book were constantly being inscribed, day by day and  hour by hour, all the important events that happened anywhere in the  known world, and they were inscribed in the book at exactly the moment  the events happened.  Every adventure in the Land of Oz and in the big  outside world, and even in places that you and I have never heard of,  were recorded accurately in the Great Book, which never made a mistake  and stated only the exact truth.  For that reason, nothing could be  concealed from Glinda the Good, who had only to look at the pages of  the Great Book of Records to know everything that had taken place. That  was one reason she was such a great Sorceress, for the records made her  wiser than any other living person.    This wonderful book was placed upon a big gold table that stood in the  middle of Glinda's drawing room.  The legs of the table, which were  incrusted with precious gems, were firmly fastened to the tiled floor,  and the book itself was chained to the table and locked with six stout  golden padlocks, the keys to which Glinda carried on a chain that was  secured around her own neck.  The pages of the Great Book were larger  in size than those of an American newspaper, and although they were  exceedingly thin, there were so many of them that they made an  enormous, bulky volume.  With its gold cover and gold clasps, the book  was so heavy that three men could scarcely have lifted it.  Yet this  morning when Glinda entered her drawing room after breakfast, the good  Sorceress was amazed to discover that her Great Book of Records had  mysteriously disappeared.    Advancing to the table, she found the chains had been cut with some  sharp instrument, and this must have been done while all in the castle  slept. Glinda was shocked and grieved.  Who could have done this  wicked, bold thing?  And who could wish to deprive her of her Great  Book of Records?    The Sorceress was thoughtful for a time, considering the consequences  of her loss.  Then she went to her Room of Magic to prepare a charm  that would tell her who had stolen the Record Book.  But when she  unlocked her cupboard and threw open the doors, all of her magical  instruments and rare chemical compounds had been removed from the  shelves.  The Sorceress has now both angry and alarmed.  She sat down  in a chair and tried to think how this extraordinary robbery could have  taken place.  It was evident that the thief was some person of very  great power, or the theft could not have been accomplished without her  knowledge. But who, in all the Land of Oz, was powerful and skillful  enough to do this awful thing?  And who, having the power, could also  have an object in defying the wisest and most talented Sorceress the  world has ever known?    Glinda thought over the perplexing matter for a full hour, at the end  of which time she was still puzzled how to explain it.  But although  her instruments and chemicals were gone, her KNOWLEDGE of magic had not  been stolen, by any means, since no thief, however skillful, can rob  one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest  treasure to acquire.  Glinda believed that when she had time to gather  more magical herbs and elixirs and to manufacture more magical  instruments, she would be able to discover who the robber was and what  had become of her precious Book of Records.    \"Whoever has done this,\" she said to her maidens, \"is a very foolish  person, for in time he is sure to be found out and will then be  severely punished.\"    She now made a list of the things she needed and dispatched messengers  to every part of Oz with instructions to obtain them and bring them to  her as soon as possible.  And one of her messengers met the little  Wizard of Oz, who was seated on the back of the famous live Sawhorse  and was clinging to its neck with both his arms, for the Sawhorse was  speeding to Glinda's castle with the velocity of the wind, bearing the  news that Royal Ozma, Ruler of all the great Land of Oz, had suddenly  disappeared and no one in the Emerald City knew what had become of her.    \"Also,\" said the Wizard as he stood before the astonished Sorceress,  \"Ozma's Magic Picture is gone, so we cannot consult it to discover  where she is.  So I came to you for assistance as soon as we realized  our loss.  Let us look in the Great Book of Records.\"    \"Alas,\" returned the Sorceress sorrowfully, \"we cannot do that, for the  Great Book of Records has also disappeared!\"          CHAPTER 3    THE ROBBERY OF CAYKE THE COOKIE COOK      One more important theft was reported in the Land of Oz that eventful  morning, but it took place so far from either the Emerald City or the  castle of Glinda the Good that none of those persons we have mentioned  learned of the robbery until long afterward.    In the far southwestern corner of the Winkie Country is a broad  tableland that can be reached only by climbing a steep hill, whichever  side one approaches it.  On the hillside surrounding this tableland are  no paths at all, but there are quantities of bramble bushes with sharp  prickers on them, which prevent any of the Oz people who live down  below from climbing up to see what is on top.  But on top live the  Yips, and although the space they occupy is not great in extent, the  wee country is all their own.  The Yips had never--up to the time this  story begins--left their broad tableland to go down into the Land of  Oz, nor had the Oz people ever climbed up to the country of the Yips.    Living all alone as they did, the Yips had queer ways and notions of  their own and did not resemble any other people of the Land of Oz.  Their houses were scattered all over the flat surface; not like a city,  grouped together, but set wherever their owners' fancy dictated, with  fields here, trees there, and odd little paths connecting the houses  one with another.  It was here, on the morning when Ozma so strangely  disappeared from the Emerald City, that Cayke the Cookie Cook  discovered that her diamond-studded gold dishpan had been stolen, and  she raised such a hue and cry over her loss and wailed and shrieked so  loudly that many of the Yips gathered around her house to inquire what  was the matter.    It was a serious thing in any part of the Land of Oz to accuse one of  stealing, so when the Yips heard Cayke the Cookie Cook declare that her  jeweled dishpan had been stolen, they were both humiliated and  disturbed and forced Cayke to go with them to the Frogman to see what  could be done about it.  I do not suppose you have ever before heard of  the Frogman, for like all other dwellers on that tableland, he had  never been away from it, nor had anyone come up there to see him.  The  Frogman was in truth descended from the common frogs of Oz, and when he  was first born he lived in a pool in the Winkie Country and was much  like any other frog.  Being of an adventurous nature, however, he soon  hopped out of his pool and began to travel, when a big bird came along  and seized him in its beak and started to fly away with him to its  nest.  When high in the air, the frog wriggled so frantically that he  got loose and fell down, down, down into a small hidden pool on the  tableland of the Yips.  Now that pool, it seems, was unknown to the  Yips because it was surrounded by thick bushes and was not near to any  dwelling, and it proved to be an enchanted"]]]
