[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#2)"],[1,"with his books we recognize in him a brother-soul who has  suffered, felt, thought, pretty nearly like us. He came into an ending  world, on the eve of the great cataclysm which was going to carry away an  entire civilization--a tragic turning-point of history, a time troubled and  often very grievous, which was hard to live in for all, and to even the  most determined minds must have appeared desperate. The peace of the Church  was not yet settled; consciences were divided. People hesitated between the  belief of yesterday and the belief of to-morrow. Augustin was among those  who had the courage to choose, and who, having once chosen their faith,  proclaimed it without weakening. The belief of a thousand years was dying  out, quenched by a young belief to which was promised an eternal duration.  How many delicate souls must have suffered from this division, which cut  them off from their traditions and obliged them, as they thought, to be  false to their dead along with the religion of their ancestors! All the  irritations which the fanatics of to-day inflict upon believing souls, many  must have had to suffer then. The sceptics were infused by the intolerance  of the others. But the worst (even as it is to-day) was to watch the  torrent of foolishness which, under cover of religion, philosophy, or  miracle-working, pretended to the conquest of mind and will. Amid this mass  of wildest doctrines and heresies, in this orgy of vapid intellectualism,  they had indeed solid heads who were able to resist the general  intoxication. And among all these people talking nonsense, Augustin appears  admirable with his good sense.    This \"intellectual,\" this mystic, was not only a man of prayer and  meditation. The prudence of the man of action and the administrator  balanced his outbursts of dialectical subtility, often carried too far. He  had that sense of realities such as we flatter ourselves that we have; he  had a knowledge of life and passion. Compared to the experience of, say,  Bossuet, how much wider was Augustin's! And with all that, a quivering  sensitiveness which is again like our own--the sensitiveness of times of  intense culture, wherein the abuse of thought has multiplied the ways of  suffering in exasperating the desire for pleasure. \"The soul of antiquity  was rude and vain.\" It was, above all, limited. The soul of Augustin is  tender and serious, eager for certainties and those enjoyments which do  not betray. It is vast and sonorous; let it be stirred ever so little, and  from it go forth deep vibrations which render the sound of the infinite.  Augustin, before his conversion, had the apprehensions of our Romantics,  the causeless melancholy and sadness, the immense yearnings for \"anywhere  but here,\" which overwhelmed our fathers. He is really very close to us.    He has broadened our Latin souls by reconciling us with the Barbarian. The  Latin, like the Greek, only understood himself. The Barbarian had not the  right to express himself in the language of the Empire. The world was split  into two parts which endeavoured to ignore each other, Augustin has made us  conscious of the nameless regions, the vague countries of the soul, which  hitherto had lain shrouded in the darkness of barbarism. By him the union  of the Semitic and the Occidental genius is consummated. He has acted as  our interpreter for the Bible. The harsh Hebraic words become soft to our  ears by their passage through the cultivated mouth of the rhetorician. He  has subjugated us with the word of God. He is a Latin who speaks to us of  Jehovah.    Others, no doubt, had done it before him. But none had found a similar  emotion, a note of tenderness so moving. The gentle violence of his charity  wins the adherence of hearts. He breathes only charity. After St. John, it  is he who is the Apostle of Love.    His tireless voice dominated the whole of the West. The Middle Ages still  heard it. For centuries his sermons and treatises were copied over and  over again; they were repeated in cathedrals, commented in abstracts of  theology. People came to accept even his theory of the fine arts. All that  we have inherited from the ancients reaches us through Augustin. He is the  great teacher. In his hands the doctrinal demonstration of the Catholic  religion takes firm shape. To indicate the three great stages of the onward  march of the truth, one may say: Jesus Christ, St. Paul, St. Augustin.  Nearest to our weakness is the last. He is truly our spiritual father. He  has taught us the language of prayer. The words of Augustin's prayers are  still upon the lips of the devout.    This universal genius, who during forty years was the speaking-trumpet of  Christendom, was also the man of one special century and country. Augustin  of Thagaste is the great African.    Well may we be proud of him and adopt him as one of our glories--we who  have kept up, for now almost a century, a struggle like to that which  he maintained for the unity of the Roman Empire, we who consider Africa  as an extension of France. More than any other writer, he has expressed  the temperament and the genius of his country. This motley Africa, with  its eternal mixture of races at odds with one another, its jealous  sectarianism, the variety of its scenery and climate, the violence  of its sensations and passions, its seriousness of character and its  quick-changing humour, its mind at once practical and frivolous, its  materialism and its mysticism, its austerity and its luxury, its  resignation to servitude and its instincts of independence, its hunger  to rule--all that comes out with singularly vivid touches in the work of  Augustin. Not only was he his country's voice, but, as far as he could, he  realized its old dream of dominion. The supremacy in spiritual matters that  Carthage disputed so long and bitterly with Rome, it ended by obtaining,  thanks to Augustin. As long as he lived, the African Church was the  mistress of the Churches of the West.    As for me--if I may venture to refer to myself in such a matter--I have had  the joy to recognize in him, besides the Saint and Teacher whom I revere,  the ideal type of the Latin of Africa. The image of which I descried the  outline long ago through the mirages of the South in following the waggons  of my rugged heroes, I have seen at last become definite, grow clear, wax  noble and increase to the very heaven, in following the traces of Augustin.    And even supposing that the life of this child of Thagaste, the son of  Monnica, were not intermingled so deeply with ours, though he were for us  only a foreigner born in a far-off land, nevertheless he would still remain  one of the most fascinating and luminous souls who have shone amid our  darkness and warmed our sadness--one of the most human and most divine  creatures who have trod our highways.          THE FIRST PART    DAYS OF CHILDHOOD      Sed delectabat ludere.    \"Only, I liked to play.\"      _Confessions_, I, 9.          I    AN AFRICAN FREE-TOWN SUBJECT TO ROME      Little streets, quite white, which climb up to clay-formed hills deeply  furrowed by the heavy winter rains; between the double row of houses,  brilliant in the morning sun, glimpses of sky of a very tender blue; here  and there, in the strip of deep shade which lies along the thresholds,  white figures crouched upon rush-mats--indolent outlines, draped with  bright colours, or muffled in rough and sombre wool-stuffs; a horseman who  passes, bent almost in two in his saddle, the big hat of the South flung  back over his shoulders, and encouraging with his heel the graceful trot of  his horse--such is Thagaste as we see it to-day, and such undoubtedly it  appeared to the traveller in the days of Augustin.    Like the French town built upon its ruins, the African free-city lay in a  sort of plain taken between three round hills. One of them, the highest  one, which is now protected by a _bordj_, must have been defended in old  days by a _castellum_. Full-flowing waters moisten the land. To those  coming from the stony regions about Constantine and Setif, or the vast bare  plain of the Medjerda, Thagaste gives an impression of freshness and cool.  It is a laughing place, full of greenery and running water. To the Africans  it offers a picture of those northern countries which they have never seen,  with its wooded mountains covered by pines and cork trees and ilex. It  presents itself as a land of mountain and forest--especially forest. It is  a hunter's country. Game is plentiful there--boar, hare, redwing, quail,  partridge. In Augustin's time, wild beasts were apparently more numerous in  the district than they are to-day. When he compares his adversaries, the  Donatists, to roaring lions, he speaks like a man who knows what a lion is.    To the east and west, wide stretches of woodland, rounded hill-summits,  streams and torrents which pour through the valleys and glens--there  you have Thagaste and the country round about--the world, in fact, as  it revealed itself to the eyes of the child Augustin. But towards the  south the verdure grows sparse; arid mountain-tops appear, crushed down  as blunted cones, or jutted in slim Tables of the Law; the sterility  of the desert becomes perceptible amid the wealth of vegetation. This  full-foliaged land has its harsh and stern localities. The African light,  however, softens all that. The deep green of the oaks and pines runs into  waves of warm and ever-altering tints which are a caress and a delight for  the eye. A man has it thoroughly brought home to him that he is in a land  of the sun.    To say the least, it is a country of strongly marked features which affords  the strangest contrast with the surrounding districts. This wooded Numidia,  with its flowing brooks, its fields where the cattle graze, differs in the  highest degree from the Numidia towards Setif--a wide, desolate plain,  where the stubble of the wheat-fields, the sandy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#2)"],[1," shall not have labored in vain.    _Amherst College, June 1, 1847_.          PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION      The text of this edition has been carefully revised and compared with  those of Döderlein, Halle, 1847, Orelli, Zurich, 1848, and Ritter, Bonn  and Cambridge, 1848. The notes also have been re-examined and, to a  considerable extent, re-written; partly to correspond with the progress  of my own mind, partly in accordance with suggestions derived from the  above named editions, and from friendly criticisms either by letter or in  the public journals. Among the journals, I am particularly indebted to  the Bibliotheca Sacra and the New-Englander; and for communications by  letter, I am under especial obligations to Professors Crosby and Sanborn  of Dartmouth College, Robbins of Middlebury, and Lincoln of Brown  University.    In revising the geography of the Germania, I have consulted, without  however entering much into detail, Ukert's invaluable treatise on the  Geography of the Greeks and Romans, whose volume on Germany contains a  translation and running commentary on almost the entire work of Tacitus.  Particular attention has been paid to the ethnology of the tribes and  nations, in reference to whose origin and early history Tacitus is among  the best authorities. In this department the works of Prichard and Latham  have been my chief reliance. Grimm and Zeuss, though often referred to, I  regret to say I have been able to consult only at second hand.    In sending out this revised edition of these most delightful treatises of  an author, in the study of whose works I never tire, I cannot but express  the hope, that it has been not a little improved by these alterations and  additions, while it will be found to have lost none of the essential  features by which the first edition was commended to so good a measure of  public favor.    W. S. Tyler.    _Amherst, May_, 1852          LIFE OF TACITUS.      It is the office of genius and learning, as of light, to illustrate  other things, and not itself. The writers, who, of all others perhaps,  have told us most of the world, just as it has been and is, have told us  least of themselves. Their character we may infer, with more or less  exactness, from their works, but their history is unwritten and must for  ever remain so. Homer, though, perhaps, the only one who has been argued  out of existence, is by no means the only one whose age and birthplace  have been disputed. The native place of Tacitus is mere matter of  conjecture. His parentage is not certainly known. The time of his birth  and the year of his death are ascertained only by approximation, and very  few incidents are recorded in the history of his life; still we know the  period in which he lived, the influences under which his character was  developed and matured, and the circumstances under which he wrote his  immortal works. In short, we know his times, though we can scarcely  gather up enough to denominate his life; and the times in which an author  lived, are often an important, not to say, essential means of elucidating  his writings.    CAIUS CORNELIUS TACITUS was born in the early part of the reign of Nero,  and near the middle of the first century in the Christian Era. The  probability is, that he was the son of Cornelius Tacitus, a man of  equestrian rank, and procurator of Belgic Gaul under Nero; that he was  born at Interamna in Umbria, and that he received a part of his education  at Massilia (the modern Marseilles), which was then the Athens of the  West, a Grecian colony, and a seat of truly Grecian culture and  refinement. It is not improbable that he enjoyed also the instructions of  Quintilian, who for twenty years taught at Rome that pure and manly  eloquence, of which his Institutes furnish at once such perfect rules,  and so fine an example. If we admit the Dialogue de Claris Oratoribus to  be the work of Tacitus, his beau-idéal of the education proper for an  orator was no less comprehensive, no less elevated, no less liberal, than  that of Cicero himself; and if his theory of education was, like  Cicero's, only a transcript of his own education, he must have been  disciplined early in all the arts and sciences--in all the departments  of knowledge which were then cultivated at Rome; a conclusion in which we  are confirmed also by the accurate and minute acquaintance which he  shows, in his other works, with all the affairs, whether civil or  military, public or private, literary or religious, both of Greece and  Rome.    The boyhood and youth of Tacitus did, indeed, fall on evil times.  Monsters in vice and crime had filled the throne, till their morals and  manners had infected those of all the people. The state was distracted,  and apparently on the eve of dissolution. The public taste, like the  general conscience, was perverted. The fountains of education were  poisoned. Degenerate Grecian masters were inspiring their Roman pupils  with a relish for a false science, a frivolous literature, a vitiated  eloquence, an Epicurean creed, and a voluptuous life.    But with sufficient discernment to see the follies and vices of his age,  and with sufficient virtue to detest them, Tacitus must have found his  love of wisdom and goodness, of liberty and law, strengthened by the  very disorders and faults of the times. If the patriot ever loves a  well-regulated freedom, it will be in and after the reign of a tyrant,  preceded or followed by what is still worse, anarchy. If the pure and the  good ever reverence purity and goodness, it will be amid the general  prevalence of vice and crime. If the sage ever pants after wisdom, it is  when the fountains of knowledge have become corrupted. The reigns of Nero  and his immediate successors were probably the very school, of all  others, to which we are most indebted for the comprehensive wisdom, the  elevated sentiments, and the glowing eloquence of the biographer of  Agricola, and the historian of the Roman Empire. His youth saw, and felt,  and deplored the disastrous effects of Nero's inhuman despotism, and of  the anarchy attending the civil wars of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. His  manhood saw, and felt, and exulted in the contrast furnished by the  reigns of Vespasian and Titus, though the sun of the latter too soon went  down, in that long night of gloom, and blood, and terror, the tyranny of  Domitian. And when, in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, he enjoyed the  rare felicity of thinking what he pleased, and speaking what he thought,  he was just fitted in the maturity of his faculties, and the extent of  his observation and reflections, \"to enroll slowly, year after year, that  dreadful reality of crimes and sufferings, which even dramatic horror, in  all its license of wild imagination, can scarcely reach, the long  unvarying catalogue of tyrants and executioners, and victims that return  thanks to the gods and die, and accusers rich with their blood, and more  mighty as more widely hated, amid the multitudes of prostrate slaves,  still looking whether there may not yet have escaped some lingering  virtue which it may be a merit to destroy, and having scarcely leisure to  feel even the agonies of remorse in the continued sense of the  precariousness of their own gloomy existence.\" [Brown's Philosophy of the  Mind.]    Tacitus was educated for the bar, and continued to plead causes,  occasionally at least, and with not a little success, even after he had  entered upon the great business of his life, as a writer of history. We  find references to his first, and perhaps his last appearance, as an  advocate, in the Letters of Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The  first was, when Pliny was nineteen, and Tacitus a little older (how much  we are not informed), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as to awaken  the emulation and the envy, though not in a bad sense, of Pliny. The last  was some twenty years later, when Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends of  a whole life, the brightest ornaments of literature and of the forum,  were associated by the choice of the Senate, and pleaded together at  the bar of the Senate, and in the presence of the Emperor Trajan, for  the execution of justice upon Marius Priscus, who was accused of  maladministration in the proconsulship of Africa. Pliny says, that  Tacitus spoke with singular gravity and eloquence, and the Senate passed  a unanimous vote of approbation and thanks to both the orators, for the  ability and success with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.  Epis. ii. 11)    We have also the comments of Pliny on a panegyrical oration, which  Tacitus pronounced, when consul, upon his predecessor in the consular  office, Verginius Rufus, perhaps the most remarkable man of his age,  distinguished alike as a hero, a statesman, and a scholar, and yet so  modest or so wise that he repeatedly refused the offer of the imperial  purple. \"Fortune,\" says Pliny, \"always faithful to Verginius, reserved  for her last favor, such an orator to pronounce a eulogium on such  virtues. It was enough to crown the glory of a well spent life\" (Plin.  Epis. ii. 1).    The speeches in the historical works of Tacitus, though rather concise  and abstract for popular orations, are full of force and fire. Some of  them are truly Demosthenic in their impassioned and fiery logic. The  speech of Galgacus before the Briton army, when driven into the extremity  of Caledonia by the Romans under Agricola, can hardly be surpassed for  patriotic sentiments, vigorous reasoning, and burning invective. The  address of Germanicus to his mutinous soldiers (in the Annals) is not  less remarkable for tender pathos. The sage and yet soldierlike address  of the aged Galba to his adopted son Piso, the calm and manly speech of  Piso to the body guard, the artful harangue of the demagogue Otho to his  troops, the no less crafty address of Mucianus to Vespasian, the headlong  rapidity of Antonius' argument for"]]]
