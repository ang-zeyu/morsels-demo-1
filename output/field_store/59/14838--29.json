Probably it was its  nearness to M80 which suggested to his mind the apparent connection of  such vacancies with star-clusters which we have already mentioned.    But the most marvelous of the ``coal-sacks'' are those that have been  found by photography in Sagittarius. One of Barnard's earliest and  most excellent photographs includes two of them, both in the  star-cluster M8. The larger, which is roughly rectangular in outline,  contains one little star, and its smaller neighbor is lune-shaped --  surely a most singular form for such an object. Both are associated  with curious dark lanes running through the clustered stars like  trails in the woods. Along the borders of these lanes the stars are  ranked in parallel rows, and what may be called the bottoms of the  lanes are not entirely dark, but pebbled with faint stellar points.  One of them which skirts the two dark gaps and traverses the cluster  along its greatest diameter is edged with lines of stars, recalling  the alignment of the trees bordering a French highway. This road of  stars cannot be less than many billions of miles in length!    All about the cluster the bed of the Galaxy is strangely disturbed,  and in places nearly denuded, as if its contents had been raked away  to form the immense stack and the smaller accumulations of stars  around it. The well-known ``Trifid Nebula'' is also included in the  field of the photograph, which covers a truly marvelous region, so  intricate in its mingling of nebulae, star-clusters, star-swarms,  star-streams, and dark vacancies that no description can do it  justice. Yet, chaotic as it appears, there is an unmistakable  suggestion of unity about it, impressing the beholder with the idea  that all the different parts are in some way connected, and have not  been fortuitously thrown together. Miss Agnes M. Clerke made the  striking remark that the dusky lanes in M8 are exemplified on the  largest scale in the great rift dividing the Milky Way, from Cygnus in  the northern hemisphere all the way to the ``Cross'' in the southern.  Similar lanes are found in many other clusters, and they are generally  associated with flanking rows of stars, resembling in their  arrangement the thick-set houses and villas along the roadways that  traverse the approaches to a great city.    But to return to the black gaps. Are they really windows in the  star-walls of the universe? Some of them look rather as if they had  been made by a shell fired through a luminous target, allowing the eye  to range through the hole into the void space beyond. If science is  discretely silent about these things, what can the more venturesome  and less responsible imagination suggest? Would a huge ``runaway  sun,'' like Arcturus, for instance, make such an opening if it should  pass like a projectile through the Milky Way? It is at least a  stimulating inquiry. Being probably many thousands of times more  massive than the galactic stars, such a stellar missile would not be  stopped by them, though its direction of flight might be altered. It  would drag the small stars lying close to its course out of their  spheres, but the ultimate tendency of its attraction would be to sweep  them round in its wake, thus producing rather a star-swarm than a  vacancy. Those that were very close to it might be swept away in its  rush and become its satellites, careering away with it in its flight  into outer space; but those that were farther off, and they would, of  course, greatly outnumber the nearer ones, would tend inward from all  sides toward the line of flight, as dust and leaves collect behind a  speeding motor (though the forces operating would be different), and  would fill up the hole, if hole it were. A swarm thus collected should  be rounded in outline and bordered with a relatively barren ring from  which the stars had been ``sucked'' away. In a general sense the M8  cluster answers to this description, but even if we undertook to  account for its existence by a supposition like the above, the black  gaps would remain unexplained, unless one could make a further draft  on the imagination and suggest that the stars had been thrown into a  vast eddy, or system of eddies, whose vortices appear as dark holes.  Only a maelstrom-like motion could keep such a funnel open, for  without regard to the impulse derived from the projectile, the proper  motions of the stars themselves would tend to fill it. Perhaps some  other cause of the whirling motion may be found. As we shall see when  we come to the spiral nebulae, gyratory movements are exceedingly  prevalent throughout the universe, and the structure of the Milky Way  is everywhere suggestive of them. But this is hazardous sport even for  the imagination -- to play with suns as if they were but thistle-down  in the wind or corks in a mill-race.    Another question arises: What is the thickness of the hedge of stars  through which the holes penetrate? Is the depth of the openings  proportionate to their width? In other words, is the Milky Way round  in section like a rope, or flat and thin like a ribbon? The answer is  not obvious, for we have little or no information concerning the  relative distances of the faint galactic stars. It would be easier,  certainly, to conceive of openings in a thin belt than in a massive  ring, for in the first case they would resemble mere rifts and breaks,  while in the second they would be like wells or bore-holes. Then, too,  the fact that the Milky Way is not a continuous body but is made up of  stars whose actual distances apart is great, offers another quandary;  persistent and sharply bordered apertures in such an assemblage are a  priori as improbable, if not impossible, as straight, narrow holes  running through a swarm of bees.    The difficulty of these questions indicates one of the reasons why it  has been suggested that the seeming gaps, or many of them, are not  openings at all, but opaque screens cutting off the light from stars  behind them. That this is quite possible in some cases is shown by  Barnard's later photographs, particularly those of the singular region  around the star Rho Ophiuchi. Here are to be seen somber lanes and  patches, apparently forming a connected system which covers an immense  space, and which their discoverer thinks may constitute a ``dark  nebula.'' This seems at first a startling suggestion; but, after all,  why should their not be dark nebulae as well as visible ones? In truth,  it has troubled some astronomers to explain the luminosity of the  bright nebulae, since it is not to be supposed that matter in so  diffuse a state can be incandescent through heat, and phosphorescent  light is in itself a mystery. The supposition is also in accord with  what we know of the existence of dark solid bodies in space. Many  bright stars are accompanied by obscure companions, sometimes as  massive as themselves; the planets are non-luminous; the same is true  of meteors before they plunge into the atmosphere and become heated by  friction; and many plausible reasons have been found for believing  that space contains as many obscure as shining bodies of great size.  It is not so difficult, after all, then, to believe that there are  immense collections of shadowy gases and meteoric dust whose presence  is only manifested when they intercept the light coming from shining  bodies behind them.    This would account for the apparent extinguishment of light in open  space, which is indicated by the falling off in relative number of  telescopic stars below the tenth magnitude. Even as things are, the  amount of light coming to us from stars too faint to be seen with the  naked eye is so great that the statement of it generally surprises  persons who are unfamiliar with the inner facts of astronomy. It has  been calculated that on a clear night the total starlight from the  entire celestial sphere amounts to one-sixtieth of the light of the  full moon; but of this less than one-twenty-fifth is due to stars  separately distinguished by the eye. If there were no obscuring medium  in space, it is probable that the amount of starlight would be  noticeably and perhaps enormously increased.    But while it seems certain that some of the obscure spots in the Milky  Way are due to the presence of ``dark nebulae,'' or concealing veils of  one kind or another, it is equally certain that there are many which  are true apertures, however they may have been formed, and by whatever  forces they may be maintained. These, then, are veritable windows of  the Galaxy, and when looking out of them one is face to face with the  great mystery of infinite space. There the known universe visibly  ends, but manifestly space itself does not end there. It is not within  the power of thought to conceive an end to space, for the instant we  think of a terminal point or line the mind leaps forward to the  beyond. There must be space outside as well as inside. Eternity of  time and infinity of space are ideas that the intellect cannot fully  grasp, but neither can it grasp the idea of a limitation to either  space or time. The metaphysical conceptions of hypergeometry, or  fourth-dimensional space, do not aid us.    Having, then, discovered that the universe is a thing contained in  something indefinitely greater than itself; having looked out of its  windows and found only the gloom of starless night outside -- what  conclusions are we to draw concerning the beyond? It seems as empty as  a vacuum, but is it really so? If it be, then our universe is a single  atom astray in the infinite; it is the only island in an ocean without  shores; it is the one oasis in an illimitable desert. Then the Milky  Way, with its wide-flung garland of stars, is afloat like a tiny  smoke-wreath amid a horror of immeasurable vacancy, or it is an  evanescent and solitary ring of sparkling froth cast up for a moment  on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#2)"],[1,"town was fortified, and distinguished Italian  engineers were employed to design and execute the work. [2] To prevent a  sudden attack, it was surrounded by a capacious moat. At the four angles  formed by the moat were elevated structures of earth and wood planted upon  piles, with bastions and projecting angles, and the usual devices of  military architecture for the attainment of strength and facility of  defence. [3]    During the civil wars, stretching over nearly forty years of the last half  of the sixteenth century, with only brief and fitful periods of peace, this  little fortified town was a post ardently coveted by both of the contending  parties. Situated on the same coast, and only a few miles from Rochelle,  the stronghold of the Huguenots, it was obviously exceedingly important to  them that it should be in their possession, both as the key to the commerce  of the surrounding country and from the very great annoyance which an enemy  holding it could offer to them in numberless ways. Notwithstanding its  strong defences, it was nevertheless taken and retaken several times during  the struggles of that period. It was surrendered to the Huguenots in 1570,  but was immediately restored on the peace that presently followed. The king  of Navarre [4] took it by strategy in 1576, placed a strong garrison in it,  repaired and strengthened its fortifications; but the next year it was  forced to surrender to the royal army commanded by the duke of Mayenne. [5]  In 1585, the Huguenots made another attempt to gain possession of the town.  The Prince of Conde encamped with a strong force on the road leading to  Marennes, the only avenue to Brouage by land, while the inhabitants of  Rochelle co-operated by sending down a fleet which completely blocked up  the harbor. [6] While the siege was in successful progress, the prince  unwisely drew off a part of his command for the relief of the castle of  Angiers; [7] and a month later the siege was abandoned and the Huguenot  forces were badly cut to pieces by de Saint Luc, [8] the military governor  of Brouage, who pursued them in their retreat.    The next year, 1586, the town was again threatened by the Prince of Conde,  who, having collected another army, was met by De Saint Luc near the island  of Oleron, who sallied forth from Brouage with a strong force; and a  conflict ensued, lasting the whole day, with equal loss on both sides, but  with no decisive results.    Thus until 1589, when the King of Navarre, the leader of the Huguenots,  entered into a truce with Henry III., from Champlain's birth through the  whole period of his youth and until he entered upon his manhood, the little  town within whose walls he was reared was the fitful scene of war and  peace, of alarm and conflict.    But in the intervals, when the waves of civil strife settled into the calm  of a temporary peace, the citizens returned with alacrity to their usual  employment, the manufacture of salt, which was the absorbing article of  commerce in their port.    This manufacture was carried on more extensively in Saintonge than in any  other part of France. The salt was obtained by subjecting water drawn from  the ocean to solar evaporation. The low marsh-lands which were very  extensive about Brouage, on the south towards Marennes and on the north  towards Rochefort, were eminently adapted to this purpose. The whole of  this vast region was cut up into salt basins, generally in the form of  parallelograms, excavated at different depths, the earth and rubbish  scooped out and thrown on the sides, forming a platform or path leading  from basin to basin, the whole presenting to the eye the appearance of a  vast chess-board. The argillaceous earth at the bottom of the pans was made  hard to prevent the escape of the water by percolation. This was done in  the larger ones by leading horses over the surface, until, says an old  chronicler, the basins \"would hold water as if they were brass.\" The water  was introduced from the sea, through sluices and sieves of pierced planks,  passing over broad surfaces in shallow currents, furnishing an opportunity  for evaporation from the moment it left the ocean until it found its way  into the numerous salt-basins covering the whole expanse of the marshy  plains. The water once in the basins, the process of evaporation was  carried on by the sun and the wind, assisted by the workmen, who agitated  the water to hasten the process. The first formation of salt was on the  surface, having a white, creamy appearance, exhaling an agreeable perfume,  resembling that of violets. This was the finest and most delicate salt,  while that precipitated, or falling to the bottom of the basin, was of a  darker hue.    When the crystallization was completed, the salt was gathered up, drained,  and piled in conical heaps on the platforms or paths along the sides of the  basins. At the height of the season, which began in May and ended in  September, when the whole marsh region was covered with countless white  cones of salt, it presented an interesting picture, not unlike the tented  camp of a vast army.    The salt was carried from the marshes on pack-horses, equipped each with a  white canvas bag, led by boys either to the quay, where large vessels were  lying, or to small barques which could be brought at high tide, by natural  or artificial inlets, into the very heart of the marsh-fields.    When the period for removing the salt came, no time was to be lost, as a  sudden fall of rain might destroy in an hour the products of a month. A  small quantity only could be transported at a time, and consequently great  numbers of animals were employed, which were made to hasten over the  sinuous and angulated paths at their highest speed. On reaching the ships,  the burden was taken by men stationed for the purpose, the boys mounted in  haste, and galloped back for another.    The scene presented in the labyrinth of an extensive salt-marsh was lively  and entertaining. The picturesque dress of the workmen, with their clean  white frocks and linen tights; the horses in great numbers mantled in their  showy salt-bags, winding their way on the narrow platforms, moving in all  directions, turning now to the right hand and now to the left, doubling  almost numberless angles, here advancing and again retreating, often going  two leagues to make the distance of one, maintaining order in apparent  confusion, altogether presented to the distant observer the aspect of a  grand equestrian masquerade.    The extent of the works and the labor and capital invested in them were  doubtless large for that period. A contemporary of Champlain informs us  that the wood employed in the construction of the works, in the form of  gigantic sluices, bridges, beam-partitions, and sieves, was so vast in  quantity that, if it were destroyed, the forests of Guienne would not  suffice to replace it. He also adds that no one who had seen the salt works  of Saintonge would estimate the expense of forming them less than that of  building the city of Paris itself.    The port of Brouage was the busy mart from which the salt of Saintonge was  distributed not only along the coast of France, but in London and Antwerp,  and we know not what other markets on the continent of Europe. [9]    The early years of Champlain were of necessity intimately associated with  the stirring scenes thus presented in this prosperous little seaport. As we  know that he was a careful observer, endowed by nature with an active  temperament and an unusual degree of practical sense we are sure that no  event escaped his attention, and that no mystery was permitted to go  unsolved. The military and commercial enterprise of the place brought him  into daily contact with men of the highest character in their departments.  The salt-factors of Brouage were persons of experience and activity, who  knew their business, its methods, and the markets at home and abroad. The  fortress was commanded by distinguished officers of the French army, and  was a rendezvous of the young nobility; like other similar places, a  training-school for military command. In this association, whether near or  remote, young Champlain, with his eagle eye and quick ear, was receiving  lessons and influences which were daily shaping his unfolding capacities,  and gradually compacting and crystallizing them into the firmness and  strength of character which he so largely displayed in after years. His  education, such as it was, was of course obtained during this period. He  has himself given us no intimation of its character or extent. A careful  examination of his numerous writings will, however, render it obvious that  it was limited and rudimentary, scarcely extending beyond the fundamental  branches which were then regarded as necessary in the ordinary transactions  of business. As the result of instruction or association with educated men,  he attained to a good general knowledge of the French language, but was  never nicely accurate or eminently skilful in its use. He evidently gave  some attention in his early years to the study and practice of drawing.  While the specimens of his work that have come down to us are marked by  grave defects, he appears nevertheless to have acquired facility and some  skill in the art, which he made exceedingly useful in the illustration of  his discoveries in the new world.    During Champlain's youth and the earlier years of his manhood, he appears  to have been engaged in practical navigation. In his address to the Queen  [10] he says, \"this is the art which in my early years won my love, and has  induced me to expose myself almost all my life to the impetuous waves of  the ocean.\" That he began the practice of navigation at an early period may  likewise be inferred from the fact that in 1599 he was put in command of a  large French ship of 500 tons, which had been chartered by the Spanish  authorities for a voyage to the West"]]]
