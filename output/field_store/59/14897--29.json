The fairy gave it what it wanted.    When it woke, it had its needles again. Then the little pine tree  was happy.          THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL.                almost        match           across            dark          running         bare            year          slippers        fell    It was very cold. The snow fell and it was almost dark.    It was the last day of the year.    A little match girl was running in the street. Her name was Gretchen.  She had no hat on.    Her feet were bare. When she left home, she had on some big slippers  of her mama's. But they were so large that she lost them when she ran  across the street.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              apron         curly           lights            bunch         about           smelled            could         matches         cooking    Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron.    She had a little bunch in her hand.    But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them.    Poor little Gretchen!    She was cold and hungry.    The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that.    She saw lights in the houses.    She smelled good things cooking.    She said to herself, \"This is the last night of the year.\"           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              knew          window          fire            money         even            pile    Gretchen got colder and colder.    She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would whip her, if she  did not take some money to him.    It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have  a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind.    Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              frozen        candle          sitting            lighted       thought         stove            near          think           step    She sat down on a door step.    [Illustration: GRETCHEN ON THE DOOR STEP.]    Her little hands were almost frozen.    She took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. The match looked  like a little candle.    Gretchen thought she was sitting by a big stove. It was so bright.    She put the match near her feet, to warm them. Then the light went  out. She did not think that she was by the stove any more.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              another       dishes          roast            table         cloth           ready            fork          knife           turkey    Gretchen lighted another match.    Now she thought she could look into a room. In this room was a table.    A white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. There was a roast  turkey, too. It was cooked and ready to eat. The knife and fork were  in his back. The turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little  girl.    The light went out and she was in the cold and dark again.              Christmas     candles            many          until    Gretchen lighted another match. Then she thought she was sitting by  a Christmas tree. Very many candles were on the tree. It was full  of pretty things.    Gretchen put up her little hands. The light went out.    The lights on the Christmas tree went up, up--until she saw they  were the stars.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              grandma       never           before            dying         going           been    Then she saw a star fall.    \"Some one is dying,\" said little Gretchen.    Her grandma had been very good to the little girl. But she was dead.    The grandma had said, \"When a star falls some one is going to God.\"    The little girl lighted another match. It made a big light.    Gretchen thought she saw her grandma. She never looked so pretty  before. She looked so sweet and happy.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              take          goes    \"O grandma,\" said the little girl, \"take me. When the light goes out  you will go away. The stove and the turkey and the Christmas tree all  went away.\"    Then Gretchen lighted a bunch of matches. She wanted to keep her  grandma with her. The matches made it very light.    The grandma took the little girl in her arms. They went up, up--where  they would never be cold or hungry.    They were with God.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              found         next            burned            dead          froze           death    The next day came.    Some men found a little girl in the street. She was dead.    In her hand were the burned matches.    They said, \"Poor little thing, she froze to death.\"    They did not know how happy she was in heaven.          LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.                six           take            cake            coat          butter          basket            hood          always          off    When May was six years old, her grandma made her a red coat with a  hood. She looked so pretty in it that the children all called her  \"Red Riding-Hood.\"    One day her mama said, \"I want you to take this cake and some butter  to grandma.\"    Red Riding-Hood was very glad to go. She always had a good time at  grandma's.    [Illustration: LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD AND HER MOTHER]    She put the things into her little basket and ran off.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              wolf          mill            shall            going         first           wood    When Red Riding-Hood came to the wood, she met a big wolf.    [Illustration: SHE MEETS THE WOLF.]    \"Where are you going?\" said the wolf.    Red Riding-Hood said, \"I am going to see my grandma. Mama has made  her a cake and some butter.\"    \"Does she live far?\" said the wolf.    \"Yes,\" said Red Riding-Hood, \"in the white house by the mill.\"    \"I will go too, and we shall see who will get there first,\" said the  wolf.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              short         flowers         soft            stopped       tapped          pull            pick          voice           string    The wolf ran off and took a short way, but Red Riding-Hood stopped to  pick some flowers.    When the wolf got to the house, he tapped on the door.    The grandma said, \"Who is there?\" The wolf made his voice as soft as  he could. He said, \"It is little Red Riding-Hood, grandma.\"    Then the old lady said, \"Pull the string and the door will open.\"    The wolf pulled the string and the door opened.    He ran in and ate the poor old lady.    Then he jumped into her bed and put on her cap.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              tapped        thank           dear              arms          hug             called    When Red Riding-Hood tapped on the door, the wolf called out, \"Who is  there?\" Red Riding-Hood said, \"It is your little Red Riding-Hood,  grandma.\"    Then the wolf said, \"Pull the string and the door will open.\"    When she went in, she said, \"Look, grandma, see the cake and butter  mama has sent you.\"    \"Thank you, dear, put them on the table and come here.\"           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              better        hear            eyes            ears          how             teeth            ate           cruel           poor    When Red Riding-Hood went near the bed, she said, \"Oh, grandma, how  big your arms are!\"    \"The better to hug you, my dear.\"    \"How big your ears are, grandma.\"    \"The better to hear you, my dear.\"    \"How big your eyes are, grandma.\"    \"The better to see you, my dear.\"    \"How big your teeth are, grandma!\"    \"The better to eat you.\"    Then the cruel wolf jumped up and ate poor little Red Riding-Hood.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              just          hunter          scream            killed        heard           open    Just then a hunter came by. He heard Red Riding-Hood scream. The  hunter ran into the house and killed the old wolf.    [Illustration: THE GRANDMOTHER, THE HUNTER AND LITTLE RED RIDING-  HOOD.]    When he cut the wolf open, out jumped Little Red Riding-Hood and  her grandma.

At last they got very hungry. Then they came to a field with cattle.

With such force did Jack handle his adversary that he sent  him flying several yards away, where he fell in a pool of dark, slimy  water.    The spectators cheered heartily, while Mr. Henshaw clapped his grimy hands  and shouted at the top of his voice:    \"Well done, my hearty! That's a handsome trick and well worth a job.\"    Fret Offut arose from his unwelcome bath, dripping from head to foot with  the nasty mess, presenting a most unprepossessing appearance.    The foreman was turning back into the shop, followed by Jack, and the  crowd was rapidly dispersing.    \"Hold on!\" he bawled, \"that wasn't fair. I tripped--stop, Henshaw! don't  let my job go to that miserable thief.\"    Getting no reply to his foolish speech, Offut followed the others into the  shop. His appearance being so ridiculous he was greeted with cries of  derision from the workmen, which only made him the more angry and  belligerent.    \"I'll get even with you for this, Jack North!\" he cried, \"if I follow you  to the end! My father always said your family was the meanest on earth,  and now I know it is so. But you shall hear from me again.\"    With these bitter words the defeated youth, who really had no one to blame  but himself for his ill-feeling, disappeared, though it was not to be long  before he was to reappear in the stirring life of Jack North, and bring  him such troubles as he could not have foreseen.    It proved that Mr. Henshaw was anxious for another workman, and after  asking Jack a few questions, told the lad he might begin his task at once.    The pay was small, less than five dollars a week, but Jack did not let  that cause him to refuse the opportunity. He needed the money, for his  folks were in poor circumstances, and he went about his work with a stout  heart.    He quickly proved an adept workman, observing, rapid to learn and always  diligent, so much so that the foreman took a strong liking to him.    Several days passed and it became evident to Jack that if he had left one  enemy outside the shop, he had another within, who was ready to improve  every opportunity to trouble him. This was a small, thinfaced man who  worked with him, and whose name was Mires. Besides being physically unable  to carry an even end with him, this workman was prone to shirk every part  of his work that he could, this portion falling largely on Jack to do in  addition to his own.    Jack paid no heed to this, however, but kept about his work as if  everything was all right, until a little incident occurred which  completely changed the aspect of affairs.    Unknown to our hero, there had been a practice of long standing among the  workmen of \"testing\" every new hand that came in, by playing what was  believed to be a smart trick upon him. The joke consisted in sending the  new hand in company with a fellow workman to bring from a distant part of  the shop a pair of wheels, one of which was of iron and weighed over four  hundred pounds, while its mate was made of wood and finished off to look  exactly like its companion. The workman in the secret always looked out  and got hold of the wooden wheel, which he could carry off with ease,  while his duped associate would struggle over the other to the unbounded  amusement of the lookers-on.    It heightened the effect by selecting a small, weak man to help in the  deception, and Henshaw, liking this joke no less than his men, on the  third day of Jack's apprenticeship, said:    \"North, you and Mires bring along them wheels at the lower end. Don't be  all day about it either,\" speaking with unusual sharpness.    \"Yes, sir.\"    In a moment every one present was watching the scene, beginning to smile  as they saw Mires start with suspicious alacrity toward the wheels. Some  of the men, in order to get as good a view as possible of the expected  exhibition, stationed themselves near at hand, having hard work to  suppress their merriment in advance.    \"Purty stout, air ye?\" asked Mires, as he and Jack stood by the wheels.    \"I never boasted of my strength,\" replied Jack, beginning to wonder why so  much interest was being manifested over so slight a matter. His surprise  was increased at that moment by discovering Fret Offut among the  spectators, his big mouth reaching almost from ear to ear with an idiotic  grin.    \"Come to see the fun!\" declared the latter, finding that he had been seen  by Jack.    \"I'll take this one,\" said Mires, stooping over the nearest wheel which  was half buried in dust and dirt.    Then, without any apparent effort, the small sized workman raised the  wheel to his shoulder and walked back from the direction whence they had  come.    \"Now see the big gawk lift his!\" exclaimed Fret Offut, who had somehow  been let into the secret. Still ignorant of the deception being played  upon him, Jack North bent over to lift the remaining wheel.          Chapter III    A Long Trip Proposed        Having seen Mires carry off the other wheel with comparative ease, Jack  naturally expected to lift the remaining one without trouble.    His amazement may be therefore understood when, at his first effort, he  failed to move it an inch from the floor.    It lay there as solid as if bound down!    His failure was the signal for Fret Offut to break out into a loud laugh,  which was instantly caught up by the workmen, until the whole building  rang with the merriment.    \"Baby!\" some one cried. \"See Mires carry his. North ain't got the strength  of a mouse!\"    By that time Mires had reached the opposite end of the shop, and was  putting down his burden to turn and join in the outbursts over the  discomfiture of his young companion.    Jack had now awakened to the realization that he had been the easy victim  of a scheme to cast ridicule upon him.    Mires could never have carried away this wheel. The thought of the trick  which had been played upon him aroused all the latent energy he possessed.  He did not believe the wheel could weigh five hundred pounds, and if it  did not he would lift it, as he believed he could.    Thus, with the shouts and laughter of the spectators ringing in his ears,  Jack stooped for a second attempt to accomplish what no one else had ever  been able to do.    \"I'll grunt for you!\" called Offut in derision. \"Spit on your hands!\" said  a workman. Jack compressed his lips for a mighty effort, and his hands  closed on the rim of the wheel, while he concentrated every atom of  strength he had for the herculean task.    The cries of the onlookers suddenly stopped as they saw, to their  amazement, the ponderous object rise from the floor, slowly but surely,  until the young workman held it abreast of him. Not a sound broke the  deathlike stillness, save for the crunching of his own footsteps, as Jack  North walked across the shop and dropped his burden upon the wheel Mires  had placed there.    A loud crash succeeded, the heavy iron wheel having broken the imitation  into kindling wood and smashed into the floor.    The cries of derision were supplemented by loud calls of admiration, which  rang through and through the old building until a perfect din prevailed.    Fret Offut waited to see no more, but stole away unobserved by the  stalwart iron workers, who crowded around their victorious companion with  hearty congratulations. Jack had won the friendship of nearly all by his  feat, while Henshaw at once boasted of the act.    Mires, fancying that the laugh had been turned upon him, and he was about  right, allowed all of the bitterness of his sullen nature to be turned  against the young apprentice. In his wicked heart he vowed he would  humiliate Jack in the eyes of his admirers in some way and at some time.  But no opportunity came for him, as month after month passed.    Jack showed a wonderfully industrious nature, and he never seemed idle.  When not at work he was studying some part of the ponderous machinery  about him, as if anxious to learn all there was to be known about it. The  knowledge he thus obtained was to be of inestimable value to him in the  scenes to come.    This trait of his pleased Henshaw, who, if a rough man, was honest in his  intentions, and he caused Jack's wages to be raised to seven dollars a  week. This was done in opposition to his assistant, who had taken a  strange dislike to him. His reasons for this will become apparent as we  proceed. About that time Jack was surprised to find that Fret Offut had  found employment in the building, though it was more as a helper than as a  regular workman, his chief task being to wheel the scraps of iron and  waste material away and to wait upon the boss of the big steam hammer.    He did not offer to speak to Jack, but the latter soon saw him holding  whispered conversations with Mires and the second boss, Furniss, when he  felt certain by their looks and motions that he was the subject of their  remarks. Once he overheard Offut tell a companion:    \"I sha'n't wheel scrap iron always and Jack North won't be boss, either.\"    Jack had been at the engine works about six months, when he accidentally  learned that the company were planning to ship one of their machines to  South America, and that they were looking about for a suitable person to  send with it, to help unload it properly and set it up. A few days later,  as he was leaving the shop to go home, Henshaw came to him, saying:    \"Let me put a flea in your ear, Jack. John Fowler has got his eye on you  for the one to go to South America.\"    Scarcely any other announcement could have brought greater joy to Jack,  for he had a great desire to travel, and this long journey would take him  away from home for many months, he felt it would be a grand opportunity.  But he knew that Furniss had been working for the place, and he could not  realize that such good fortune was to fall to him, so he said to Henshaw:    \"I thought that Furniss was sure of the chance. I heard him say as much  only yesterday.\" \"A fig for Furniss! Old"]]]
