This is also vanity             and vexation of spirit.    21:004:005 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.    21:004:006 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full             with travail and vexation of spirit.    21:004:007 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.    21:004:008 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath             neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his             labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither             saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?             This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.    21:004:009 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for             their labour.    21:004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to             him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to             help him up.    21:004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can             one be warm alone?    21:004:012 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a             threefold cord is not quickly broken.    21:004:013 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish             king, who will no more be admonished.    21:004:014 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is             born in his kingdom becometh poor.    21:004:015 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the             second child that shall stand up in his stead.    21:004:016 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been             before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in             him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.    21:005:001 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more             ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they             consider not that they do evil.    21:005:002 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty             to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou             upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.    21:005:003 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a             fool's voice is known by multitude of words.    21:005:004 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he             hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.    21:005:005 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou             shouldest vow and not pay.    21:005:006 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say             thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should             God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine             hands?    21:005:007 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also             divers vanities: but fear thou God.    21:005:008 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent             perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not             at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest             regardeth; and there be higher than they.    21:005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself             is served by the field.    21:005:010 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor             he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.    21:005:011 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and             what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding             of them with their eyes?    21:005:012 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little             or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to             sleep.    21:005:013 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,             riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.    21:005:014 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a             son, and there is nothing in his hand.    21:005:015 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return             to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which             he may carry away in his hand.    21:005:016 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,             so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for             the wind?    21:005:017 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much             sorrow and wrath with his sickness.    21:005:018 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one             to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour             that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which             God giveth him: for it is his portion.    21:005:019 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and             hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,             and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.    21:005:020 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because             God answereth him in the joy of his heart.    21:006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is             common among men:    21:006:002 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so             that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,             yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger             eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.    21:006:003 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so             that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled             with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an             untimely birth is better than he.    21:006:004 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and             his name shall be covered with darkness.    21:006:005 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this             hath more rest than the other.    21:006:006 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he             seen no good: do not all go to one place?    21:006:007 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite             is not filled.    21:006:008 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,             that knoweth to walk before the living?    21:006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the             desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.    21:006:010 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it             is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than             he.    21:006:011 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man             the better?    21:006:012 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the             days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who             can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?    21:007:001 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of             death than the day of one's birth.    21:007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the             house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the             living will lay it to his heart.    21:007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the             countenance the heart is made better.    21:007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the             heart of fools is in the house of mirth.    21:007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to             hear the song of fools.    21:007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter             of the fool: this also is vanity.    21:007:007 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth             the heart.    21:007:008 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and             the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.    21:007:009 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in             the bosom of fools.    21:007:010 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were             better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning             this.    21:007:011 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit             to them that see the sun.    21:007:012 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the             excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them             that have it.    21:007:013 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,             which he hath made crooked?

At last we have arrived at our destination.  This is    the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor    resides.  As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I    regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse.  As a    Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to    ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an    unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that    equestrian exercise is impracticable.  No matter.  Where is our    suite?         LUIZ (coming forward).  Your Grace, I am here.         DUCH.  Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when    you address His Grace?         DUKE.  My love, it is so small a matter!  (To Luiz.)  Still,    you may as well do it.  (Luiz kneels.)         CAS.  The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect    appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian    hidalgo.         DUKE.  My child, you are hard upon our suite.         CAS.  Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons    in his plebeian position.  If he does not appreciate that    position, let him be whipped until he does.         DUKE.  Let us hope the omission was not intended as a    slight.  I should be much hurt if I thought it was.  So would he.    (To Luiz.)  Where are the halberdiers who were to have had the    honour of meeting us here, that our visit to the Grand Inquisitor    might be made in becoming state?         LUIZ.  Your Grace, the halberdiers are mercenary people who    stipulated for a trifle on account.         DUKE.  How tiresome!  Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor    is a blind gentleman.  And the band who were to have had the    honour of escorting us?  I see no band!         LUIZ.  Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required    to be paid in advance.         DUCH.  That's so like a band!         DUKE (annoyed).  Insuperable difficulties meet me at every    turn!         DUCH.  But surely they know His Grace?         LUIZ.  Exactlythey know His Grace.         DUKE.  Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf    gentleman.  A cornet-a-piston would be something.  You do not    happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a    cornet-a-piston?         LUIZ.  Alas, no, Your Grace!  But I can imitate a farmyard.         DUKE (doubtfully).  I don't see how that would help us.  I    don't see how we could bring it in.         CAS.  It would not help us in the least.  We are not a    parcel of graziers come to market, dolt!                                                                (Luiz    rises.)         DUKE.  My love, our suite's feelings!  (To Luiz.)  Be so    good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his    Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro         DUCH.  And suite         DUKE.  And suitehave arrived at Venice, and seek         CAS.  Desire         DUCH.  Demand!         DUKE.  And demand an audience.         LUIZ.  Your Grace has but to command.         DUKE (much moved).  I felt sure of itI felt sure of it!    (Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.)  And now, my love(aside to    Duchess)  Shall we tell her?  I think so(aloud to Casilda)  And    now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise.  It is my    agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you    the happiest young lady in Venice!         CAS.  A secret?         DUCH.  A secret which, for State reasons, it has been    necessary to preserve for twenty years.         DUKE.  When you were a prattling babe of six months old you    were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son    and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of    Barataria!         CAS.  Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria?    Was I consulted?  (Duke shakes his head.)  Then it was a most    unpardonable liberty!         DUKE.  Consider his extreme youth and forgive him.  Shortly    after the ceremony that misguided monarch abandoned the creed of    his forefathers, and became a Wesleyan Methodist of the most    bigoted and persecuting type.  The Grand Inquisitor, determined    that the innovation should not be perpetuated in Barataria,    caused your smiling and unconscious husband to be stolen and    conveyed to Venice.  A fortnight since the Methodist Monarch and    all his Wesleyan Court were killed in an insurrection, and we are    here to ascertain the whereabouts of your husband, and to hail    you, our daughter, as Her Majesty, the reigning Queen of    Barataria!  (Kneels.)      (During this speech Luiz re-enters.)           DUCH.  Your Majesty!  (Kneels.) (Drum roll.)         DUKE.
