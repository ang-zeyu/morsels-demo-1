North and South, tribe was giving place  to tribe, language to language; for the Indian, hopelessly unchanging in  respect to individual and social development, was, as regarded tribal  relations and local haunts, mutable as the wind. In Canada and the  northern section of the United States, the elements of change were  especially active. The Indian population which, in 1535, Cartier found  at Montreal and Quebec, had disappeared at the opening of the next  century, and another race had succeeded, in language and customs widely  different; while, in the region now forming the State of New York, a  power was rising to a ferocious vitality, which, but for the presence of  Europeans, would probably have subjected, absorbed, or exterminated  every other Indian community east of the Mississippi and north of the  Ohio.    The vast tract of wilderness from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, and  from the Carolinas to Hudson's Bay, was divided between two great  families of tribes, distinguished by a radical difference of language. A  part of Virginia and of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Southeastern New York,  New England, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Lower Canada were occupied,  so far as occupied at all, by tribes speaking various Algonquin  languages and dialects. They extended, moreover, along the shores of the  Upper Lakes, and into the dreary Northern wastes beyond. They held  Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana, and detached bands ranged  the lonely hunting-ground of Kentucky. [1]    [1] The word Algonquin is here used in its broadest signification. It  was originally applied to a group of tribes north of the River St.  Lawrence. The difference of language between the original Algonquins and  the Abenaquis of New England, the Ojibwas of the Great Lakes, or the  Illinois of the West, corresponded to the difference between French and  Italian, or Italian and Spanish. Each of these languages, again, had its  dialects, like those of different provinces of France.    Like a great island in the midst of the Algonquins lay the country of  tribes speaking the generic tongue of the Iroquois. The true Iroquois,  or Five Nations, extended through Central New York, from the Hudson to  the Genesee. Southward lay the Andastes, on and near the Susquehanna;  westward, the Eries, along the southern shore of Lake Erie, and the  Neutral Nation, along its northern shore from Niagara towards the  Detroit; while the towns of the Hurons lay near the lake to which they  have left their name. [2]    [2] To the above general statements there was, in the first half of the  seventeenth century, but one exception worth notice. A detached branch  of the Dahcotah stock, the Winnebago, was established south of Green  Bay, on Lake Michigan, in the midst of Algonquins; and small Dahcotah  bands had also planted themselves on the eastern side of the  Mississippi, nearly in the same latitude.    There was another branch of the Iroquois in the Carolinas, consisting of   the Tuscaroras and kindred bands. In 1715 they were joined to the Five  Nations.    Of the Algonquin populations, the densest, despite a recent epidemic  which had swept them off by thousands, was in New England. Here were  Mohicans, Pequots, Narragansetts, Wampanoags, Massachusetts, Penacooks,  thorns in the side of the Puritan. On the whole, these savages were  favorable specimens of the Algonquin stock, belonging to that section of  it which tilled the soil, and was thus in some measure spared the  extremes of misery and degradation to which the wandering hunter tribes  were often reduced. They owed much, also, to the bounty of the sea, and  hence they tended towards the coast; which, before the epidemic,  Champlain and Smith had seen at many points studded with wigwams and  waving with harvests of maize. Fear, too, drove them eastward; for the  Iroquois pursued them with an inveterate enmity. Some paid yearly  tribute to their tyrants, while others were still subject to their  inroads, flying in terror at the sound of the Mohawk war-cry. Westward,  the population thinned rapidly; northward, it soon disappeared. Northern  New Hampshire, the whole of Vermont, and Western Massachusetts had no  human tenants but the roving hunter or prowling warrior.    We have said that this group of tribes was relatively very populous; yet  it is more than doubtful whether all of them united, had union been  possible,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#2)"],[1,"formidable looking apparatus of a short  time ago, experimenters are now vying with each other in making small  or novel equipment. Portable sets of all sorts are being fashioned,  from one which will go into an ordinary suitcase, to one so small it  will easily slip into a Brownie camera. One receiver depicted in a  newspaper was one inch square! Another was a ring for the finger, with  a setting one inch by five-eighths of an inch, and an umbrella as a  \"ground.\" Walking sets with receivers fastened to one's belt are also  common. Daily new novelties and marvels are announced.    Meanwhile, the radio amateur to whom this book is addressed may have  his share in the joys of wireless. To get all of these good things out  of the ether one does not need a rod or a gun--only a copper wire made  fast at either end and a receiving set of some kind. If you are a  sheer beginner, then you must be very careful in buying your  apparatus, for since the great wave of popularity has washed wireless  into the hearts of the people, numerous companies have sprung up and  some of these are selling the veriest kinds of junk.    And how, you may ask, are you going to be able to know the good from  the indifferent and bad sets? By buying a make of a firm with an  established reputation. I have given a few offhand at the end of this  book. Obviously there are many others of merit--so many, indeed, that  it would be quite impossible to get them all in such a list, but these  will serve as a guide until you can choose intelligently for yourself.
