The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with  which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the  barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to  capitulate.  It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to  adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to  introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to  become bourgeois themselves.  In one word, it creates a world  after its own image.    The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the  towns.  It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the  urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued  a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural  life.  Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so  it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on  the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois,  the East on the West.    The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the  scattered state of the population, of the means of production,  and of property.  It has agglomerated production, and has  concentrated property in a few hands.  The necessary consequence  of this was political centralisation.  Independent, or but  loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws,  governments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into  one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national  class-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff.  The  bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has  created more massive and more colossal productive forces than  have all preceding generations together.  Subjection of Nature's  forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry  and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs,  clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of  rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground--what  earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive  forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?    We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose  foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in  feudal society.  At a certain stage in the development of these  means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which  feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of  agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal  relations of property became no longer compatible with the  already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters.  They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.    Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a  social and political constitution adapted to it, and by the  economical and political sway of the bourgeois class.    A similar movement is going on before our own eyes.  Modern  bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange  and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic  means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is  no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he  has called up by his spells.  For many a decade past the history  of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of  modern productive forces against modern conditions of production,  against the property relations that are the conditions for the  existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.  It is enough to  mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put  on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the  entire bourgeois society.  In these crises a great part not only  of the existing products, but also of the previously created  productive forces, are periodically destroyed.  In these crises  there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would  have seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production.  Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary  barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of  devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence;  industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?  Because  there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence,  too much industry, too much commerce.  The productive forces at  the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development  of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they  have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are  fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring  disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the  existence of bourgeois property.  The conditions of bourgeois  society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.  And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?  On the one  hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the  other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough  exploitation of the old ones.  That is to say, by paving the  way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by  diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.    The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the  ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.    But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring  death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who  are to wield those weapons--the modern working class--the  proletarians.    In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed,  in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working  class, developed--a class of labourers, who live only so long  as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour  increases capital.  These labourers, who must sell themselves  piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of  commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of  competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.    Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of  labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual  character, and consequently, all charm for the workman.  He  becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most  simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is  required of him.  Hence, the cost of production of a workman is  restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he  requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his  race.  But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of  labour, is equal to its cost of production.  In proportion  therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage  decreases.  Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and  division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden  of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working  hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by  increased speed of the machinery, etc.    Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the  patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial  capitalist.  Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are  organised like soldiers.  As privates of the industrial army they  are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers  and sergeants.  Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class,  and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by  the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the  individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.  The more openly this  despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty,  the more hateful and the more embittering it is.    The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual  labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes  developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of  women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive  social validity for the working class. All are instruments of  labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age  and sex.    No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer,  so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is  set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord,  the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.    The lower strata of the middle class--the small tradespeople,  shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and  peasants--all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly  because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale  on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the  competition with the large capitalists, partly because their  specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of  production.  Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes  of the population.    The proletariat goes through various stages of development.  With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.  At  first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by  the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade,  in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly  exploits them.  They direct their attacks not against the  bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments  of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that  compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they  set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished  status of the workman of the Middle Ages.    At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass  scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual  competition.  If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies,  this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of  the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its  own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in  motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so.  At this  stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies,  but the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#2)"],[1,"in saying, that any fashionable novelty  which comes out in either London or Paris finds its way to Melbourne by  the next steamer; for instance, I broke my parasol on board ship, and  the first thing I did on landing was to go to one of the best shops in  Collins Street to replace it. On learning what I wanted, the shopman  showed me some of those new parasols which had just come out in London  before I sailed, and which I had vainly tried to procure in S----, only  four hours from London.    The only public place we have yet visited is the Acclimatization Garden;  which is very beautifully laid out, and full of aviaries, though it  looks strange to see common English birds treated as distinguished  visitors and sumptuously lodged and cared for. Naturally, the Australian  ones interest me most, and they are certainly prettier than yours at  home, though they do not sing. I have been already to a shop where they  sell skins of birds, and have half ruined myself in purchases for hats.  You are to have a \"diamond sparrow,\" a dear little fellow with reddish  brown plumage, and white spots over its body (in this respect a  miniature copy of the Argus pheasant I brought from India), and a  triangular patch of bright yellow under its throat. I saw some of them  alive in a cage in the market with many other kinds of small birds, and  several pairs of those pretty grass or zebra paroquets, which are called  here by the very inharmonious name of \"budgerighars.\" I admired the  blue wren so much--a tiny _birdeen_ with tail and body of dust-coloured  feathers, and head and throat of a most lovely turquoise blue; it has  also a little wattle of these blue feathers standing straight out on  each side of its head, which gives it a very pert appearance. Then there  is the emu-wren, all sad-coloured, but quaint, with the tail-feathers  sticking up on end, and exactly like those of an emu; on the very  smallest scale, even to the peculiarity of two feathers growing out of  the same little quill. I was much amused by the varieties of cockatoos,  parrots, and lories of every kind and colour, shrieking and jabbering in  the part of the market devoted to them; but I am told that I have seen  very few of the varieties of birds, as it is early in the spring, and  the young ones have not yet been brought in: they appear to sell as  fast as they can be procured. But before I end my letter I must tell you  about the cockatoo belonging to this hotel. It is a famous bird in its  way, having had its portrait taken several times, descriptions written  for newspapers of its talents, and its owner boasts of enormous sums  offered and refused for it. Knowing my fondness for pets, F---- took me  downstairs to see it very soon after our arrival. I thought it hideous:  it belongs to a kind not very well known in England, of a dirtyish white  colour, a very ugly-shaped head and bill, and large bluish rings round  the eyes; the beak is huge and curved. If it knew of this last objection  on my part, it would probably answer, like the wolf in Red Riding Hood's  story, \"the better to talk with, my dear\"--for it is a weird and knowing  bird. At first it flatly refused to show off any of its accomplishments,  but one of the hotel servants good-naturedly came forward, and Cocky  condescended to go through his performances. I cannot possibly-tell you  of all its antics: it pretended to have a violent toothache, and nursed  its beak in its claw, rocking itself backwards and forwards as if in the  greatest agony, and in answer to all the remedies which were proposed,  croaking out, \"Oh, it ain't a bit of good,\" and finally sidling up, to  the edge of its perch, and saying in hoarse but confidential whisper,  \"Give us a drop of whisky, _do_.\" Its voice was extraordinarily  distinct, and when it sang several snatches of songs the words were  capitally given, with the most absurdly comic intonation, all  the _roulades_ being executed in perfect tune. I liked its sewing  performance so much--to see it hold a little piece of stuff underneath  the claw which rested on the perch, and pretend to sew with the other,  getting into difficulties with its thread, and finally setting up a loud  song in praise of sewing-machines just as if it were an advertisement.    By the next time I write I shall have seen more of Melbourne; there  will, however, be no time for another letter by this mail; but I will  leave one to be posted after we sail for New Zealand.          Letter II: Sight-seeing in Melbourne.      Melbourne, October 1st, 1865. I have left my letter to the last moment  before starting for Lyttleton; everything is re-packed and ready, and  we sail to-morrow morning in the _Albion_. She is a mail-steamer--very  small after our large vessel, but she looks clean and tidy; at all  events, we hope to be only on board her for ten days. In England one  fancies that New Zealand is quite close to Australia, so I was rather  disgusted to find we had another thousand miles of steaming to do before  we could reach our new home; and one of the many Job's comforters who  are scattered up and down the world assures me that the navigation is  the most dangerous and difficult of the whole voyage.    We have seen a good deal of Melbourne this week; and not only of the  town, for we have had many drives in the exceedingly pretty suburbs,  owing to the kindness of the D----s, who have been most hospitable and  made our visit here delightful. We drove out to their house at Toorak  three or four times; and spent a long afternoon with them; and there I  began to make acquaintance with the Antipodean trees and flowers. I hope  you will not think it a very sweeping assertion if I say that all the  leaves look as if they were made of leather, but it really is so; the  hot winds appear to parch up everything, at all events, round Melbourne,  till the greatest charm of foliage is more or less lost; the flowers  also look withered and burnt up, as yours do at the end of a long, dry  summer, only they assume this appearance after the first hot wind in  spring. The suburb called Heidelberg is the prettiest, to my taste--an  undulating country with vineyards, and a park-like appearance which,  is very charming. All round Melbourne there are nice, comfortable,  English-looking villas. At one of these we called to return a visit  and found a very handsome house, luxuriously furnished, with beautiful  garden and grounds. One afternoon we went by rail to St. Kilda's,  a flourishing bathing-place on the sea-coast, about six miles from  Melbourne. Everywhere building is going on with great rapidity, and you  do not see any poor people in the streets. If I wanted to be critical  and find fault, I might object to the deep gutters on each side of the  road; after a shower of rain they are raging torrents for a short time,  through which you are obliged to splash without regard to the muddy  consequences; and even when they are dry, they entail sudden and  prodigious jolts. There are plenty of Hansoms and all sorts of other  conveyances, but I gave F---- no peace until he took me for a drive in a  vehicle which was quite new to me--a sort of light car with a canopy  and curtains, holding four, two on each seat, _dos-a-dos_, and called  a \"jingle,\"--of American parentage, I fancy. One drive in this  carriage was quite enough, however, and I contented myself with Hansoms  afterwards; but walking is really more enjoyable than anything else,  after having been so long cooped up on board ship.    We admired the fine statue, at the top of Collins Street, to the memory  of the two most famous of Australian explorers, Burke and Wills, and  made many visits to the Museum, and the glorious Free Library; we also  went all over the Houses of Legislature--very new and grand. But  you must not despise me if I confess to having enjoyed the shops  exceedingly: it was so unlike a jeweller's shop in England to see on the  counter gold in its raw state, in nuggets and dust and flakes; in this  stage of its existence it certainly deserves its name of \"filthy lucre,\"  for it is often only half washed. There were quantities of emus' eggs  in the silversmiths' shops, mounted in every conceivable way as cups and  vases, and even as work-boxes: some designs consisted of three or five  eggs grouped together as a centre-piece. I cannot honestly say I admired  any of them; they were generally too elaborate, comprising often  a native (spear in hand), a kangaroo, palms, ferns, cockatoos, and  sometimes an emu or two in addition, as a pedestal--all this in frosted  silver or gold. I was given a pair of these eggs before leaving  England: they were mounted in London as little flower-vases in a setting  consisting only of a few bulrushes and leaves, yet far better than any  of these florid designs; but he emu-eggs are very popular in Sydney or  Melbourne, and I am told sell rapidly to people going home, who take  them as a memento of their Australian life, and probably think that the  greater the number of reminiscences suggested by the ornament the more  satisfactory it is as a purchase.    I must finish my letter by a description of a dinner-party which about  a dozen of our fellow-passengers joined with us in giving our dear old  captain before we all separated. Whilst we were on board, it very often  happened that the food was not very choice or good: at all events  we used sometimes to grumble at it, and we generally wound up our  lamentations by agreeing that when we reached Melbourne we would have a  good dinner together. Looking back on it, I must say I think we were  all rather greedy, but we tried to give a better colouring to our  gourmandism by inviting the captain, who was universally popular, and by  making it as elegant and pretty a repast as possible. Three or four of  the gentlemen formed themselves into a committee, and they must really  have worked very hard; at all events they collected everything rare and"]]]
