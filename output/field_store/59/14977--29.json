I'd like to be a strong  man, but I like good things to eat, too, and when we have company, we  have a feast.\"    His Mother did not answer him; she was too busy.    She sent Chloe to the closet for a jar of wine, and some goat's-milk  cheese, and she herself went upstairs to get some dried figs from the  store-room. Daphne followed Chloe to the closet, and for a moment there  was no one beside the hearth-fire but Dion and Argos, and the sausages  smelled very good indeed.    \"I wonder if she counted them,\" thought Dion to himself, as he looked  longingly at them. And then almost before he knew it himself he had  snatched one of the sausages from the fire and had bitten a piece off the  end! It was so very hot that it burned both his fingers and his tongue  like everything, and when he tried to lick his fingers, he let go of the  sausage, and Argos snapped it up and swallowed it whole. It burned all  the way down to his stomach, and Argos gave a dreadful howl of pain and  dashed through the door out into the farm-yard. Dion heard his Mother's  footsteps coming down the stair. He thought perhaps he'd better join  Argos.    When Lydia reached the hearth-fire once more, only Daphne was in the  room. She set down the basket of figs and knelt to turn the sausages. She  had counted them and she saw at once that one was missing. She was  shocked and surprised, but she guessed what had become of it. Mothers  are just like that. She rose from her knees and looked around for the  culprit. She saw Daphne.    \"You naughty boy!\" she said sternly to Daphne. \"What have you done with  that sausage?\"    \"I didn't do anything with it; I never even saw it,\" cried poor Daphne.  \"And, besides that, I'm not a naughty boy. I'm not a boy at all! I'm  Daphne!\"    \"Where's Dion, then?\" demanded Lydia.    \"I don't know where he is,\" said Daphne. \"I didn't see him either, but I  heard Argos howl as if some one had stepped on his tail. Maybe he took  the sausage.\"    Lydia went to the door and looked out into the farm-yard. Away off in the  farthest corner by the sheep-pen she saw two dark shadows.    \"Come here at once,\" she called.    Dion and Argos both obeyed, but they came very slowly, and Argos had his  tail between his legs. Lydia pointed to the fire.    \"Where is the other sausage?\" she inquired, with stern emphasis.    \"Argos ate it,\" said Dion.    \"Open your mouth,\" said his Mother. She looked at Dion's tongue. It was  all red where it was burned.    \"I suppose Argos took it off the fire and made you bite it when it was  hot,\" said Lydia grimly. \"Very well, he is a bad dog and cannot have any  sausage with his supper. And a boy that hasn't any more manners than a  dog can't have any either. And neither one can be trusted in the kitchen  where things are cooking. Go sit on the wood-pile until I call you.\"    She put both Dion and Argos out of doors and turned to her cooking again.    \"Supper is nearly ready,\" she called at last to Chloe. \"You and Daphne  may bring out the couch and get the table ready.\"    Under the arcade in the court there was a small wooden table. Chloe and  Daphne lifted it and brought it near the fire. Then they brought a plain  wooden bench that also stood under the thatch and placed it beside the  table. They arranged cushions of lamb's wool upon the bench, and near the  foot set a low stool. Daphne brought the dishes, and when everything was  ready, Lydia sent Chloe to call her husband and the Stranger, while she  herself went out to the farm-yard. She found Dion and Argos sitting side  by side on the wood-pile in dejected silence.    \"Come in and wash your hands,\" she said to Dion. \"If you get yourself  clean, wrists and all, you may have your supper with us, but remember, no  sausage. You have had your fingers with your food.\" This is what mothers  used to say to their children in those days, because there were no knives  or forks, and often not even spoons, to eat with.    Lydia didn't invite Argos in, but he came anyway, and lay down beside the  fire with his nose on his paws, just where people would be most likely to  stumble over him.    When Melas and the Stranger came in, they sat down side by side on the  couch. Chloe knelt before them, took off their sandals, and bathed their  feet. Then the Stranger loosened his long, cloak-like garment, and he and  Melas reclined side by side upon the couch, their left elbows resting  on the lamb's-wool cushions. Chloe moved the little table within easy  reach of their hands, and Lydia took her place on the stool beside the  couch. It was now quite dark except for the light of the hearth-fire.    The Twins had been brought up to be seen and not heard, especially when  there was company, and as Dion was not anxious to call attention to  himself just then, the two children slipped quietly into their places on  the floor by the hearth-fire just as Melas and the Stranger dipped their  bread into their broth and began to eat.    It must be confessed that Melas seemed to enjoy the black broth much  more than his guest did, but the stranger ate it nevertheless, and when  the last drop was gone, the men both wiped their fingers on scraps of  bread and threw them to Argos, who snapped them up as greedily as if his  tongue had never been burned at all. Then Chloe brought the sausages hot  from the fire, and barley-cakes from the oven. When she had served the  men and had explained that these cakes were really not so good as her  barley-cakes usually were, Lydia gave the Twins each one, and she gave  Daphne a sausage. She just looked at Dion without a single word.    He knew perfectly well what she meant. He munched his barley-cake in  mournful silence, and I suppose no sausage ever smelled quite so good to  any little boy in the whole world as Daphne's did to Dion just then.  However, there were plenty of barley-cakes, and his mother let him have  honey to eat with them, which comforted Dion so much that when the  Stranger began to talk to Melas, he forgot his troubles entirely. He  forgot his manners too, and listened with his eyes and mouth both wide  open until the honey ran off the barley-cake and down between his  fingers. Then he licked his fingers!    No one saw him do it, not even his Mother, because she too was watching  the the inhabitants of the little farm. They lived so far from the sea,  and so far from highways of travel on the island, that the Twins in all  their lives had seen but few persons besides their own family and the  slaves who worked on the farm. The Stranger was to them a visitor from  another world--the great outside world which lay beyond the shining blue  waters of the bay. They had seen that distant world sometimes from a  hill-top on a clear day, but they had never been farther from home  than the little seaport of Ambelaca two miles away.    \"How is it,\" the Stranger was saying to Melas, \"that you, a Spartan, live  here, so far from your native soil, and so near to Athens? The Spartans  have but little love for the Athenians as a rule, nor for farming either,  I am told.\"    \"We love the Athenians quite as well as they love us,\" answered Melas;  \"and as for my being here, I have my father to thank for that. He was a  soldier of the Persian Wars and settled here after the Battle of Salamis.  I grew up on the island, and thought myself fortunate when I had a chance  to become overseer on this farm.\"    \"Who is the owner of the farm?\" asked the Stranger.    \"Pericles, Chief Archon of Athens,\" answered Melas.    \"You are indeed fortunate to be in his service,\" said the Stranger. \"He  is the greatest man in Athens, and consequently the greatest man in the  world, as any Athenian would tell you!\"    \"Do you know him?\" asked Dion, quite forgetting in his interest that  children should be seen and not heard.    Lydia shook her head at Dion, but the Stranger answered just as politely  as if Dion were forty years old instead of ten.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know Pericles well. I went with him only yesterday to  see the new temple he is having built upon the great hill of the  Acropolis in Athens. You have seen it, of course,\" he said, turning to  Melas.    \"No,\" answered Melas. \"I sell most of my produce in the markets of the  Piraeus, and go to Athens itself only when necessary to take fruit and  vegetables to the city home of Pericles. There is no occasion to  go in the winter, and the season for planting is only just begun. Perhaps  later in the summer I shall go.\"    \"When you do,\" said the Stranger, \"do not fail to see the new building on  the sacred hill. It is worth a longer journey than from here to Athens, I  assure you. People will come from the ends of the earth to see it some  day, or I am no true prophet.\"    \"Oh,\" murmured Daphne to Dion, \"don't you wish we could go too?\"    \"You can't go. You're a girl!\" Dion whispered back. \"Girls can't do such  things, but I'm going to get Father to take me with him the very next  time he goes.\"    Daphne turned up her nose at Dion. \"I don't care if I am a girl,\" she  whispered back. \"I'm no Athenian sissy that never puts her nose out of  doors, I can do everything you can do here on the farm, and I guess I  could in Athens too. Besides, no one would know I'm a girl; I look just  as much like a boy as you do. I look just like you.\"    \"You do not,\" said Dion resentfully. \"You can't look like a boy.\"    \"Ail right,\" answered Daphne, \"then you must look just like a girl, for  you know very well Father can't tell us apart, so there now.\"    Dion opened his mouth to reply, but just then his Mother shook her head  at them, and at the same moment Chloe, coming in with the wine-jar,  stumbled over Argos and nearly fell on the table. Argos yelped, and  Dion and Daphne both laughed.

Liberty was borne down under a  weight of circumstance all the more oppressive because it was  thought that the new order of things was the natural product of the  Revolution; and indeed it looked so. Literature was bidden to flourish  by the despot. He posed as a protector of the arts, and at his command  the seventeenth century was to begin again and a new Corneille, a new  Boileau, a new Molière, were to adorn his reign. But he who conquered  Italy could not compel unwilling Minerva, and the victor of the  Pyramids could not reanimate a dead past. The writings of the period  1800-1815, indeed the whole intellectual life of that time, its art,  its music, its literature, its philosophy, are what might have been  expected.    After the downfall of Napoleon what intellectual ideals remained in  France? With what equipment of thoughts and moral forces did she set  out at the beginning of this new epoch? With no equipment that was at  all adequate for solving the staggering problems set for her to solve.  Just think of them! She had to deal with monarchy and a state church  all over again. She had to decide between the spirit of the old règime  and the spirit of '89. There was a contradiction in her past, and she  had to turn her back on one or the other fascinating epoch in her  history--either on Louis Quatorze and the _grand siècle_ with all its  glory of treasured acquirement, its shining names, its illustrious and  venerable institutions, or on the less attractive men and measures and  purposes of the Revolution; and these latter, though apparently less  worthy of proud contemplation, impressed the conscience and the  political sense as being the things fullest of life for the dawning  future. The most loyal conservative must have felt an awkward  consciousness that the things he hated would in the end prevail.    Such, then, was the intellectual condition of France in  1815--uncertainty and division and dearth of ideals and purposes,  in the face of a future full of perplexing problems. But she was  strangely hopeful. She has never been otherwise. The French are the  most elastic people in Europe, and no defeat has ever discouraged  them. And she was in love with herself as much as ever, and as fully  convinced of her right to the leading place among all nations. Indeed  it did not occur to her that she had ever surrendered that right.    What have been the principal lines of movement in French literature  since 1815? In order to answer this question we must not merely follow  the traces of political history and say that literature changed with  the government. Such a solution would be facile, but would do violence  to the facts. The matter is verv indeterminate, and the best way to  bring it into a clear arrangement is to ask ourselves who were the  influential writers of any given period and what did they stand for.  In 1815 there were three men prominent in French letters and life:  Chateaubriand, Lamartine, and Lamennais. Victor Hugo was born in 1802,  and by 1817 he had become a literary man, not by intention merely, but  by writing. He came upon the scene, therefore, when these three men  were at the height of their activity; for Chateaubriand was born in  1768, Lamartine in 1790, and Lamennais in 1782; and they, appreciating  the need of leadership in France under the newly restored monarchy,  had thrown themselves enthusiastically into the work of instructing  the people. Let us inquire who they were and what was the nature of  their activity; or, in other words, what was the first public literary  atmosphere that surrounded Victor Hugo.    Chateaubriand at the age of seventeen was a captain of cavalry under  Louis XVI. When the Revolution broke out he came to America on a  royal commission to find the northwest passage. He brought letters of  introduction to the chief personages of the new world, and was  much impressed with the simple and gracious reception given him by  Washington, and with his unpretentious mode of life. After the failure  of his geographical researches, the young officer plunged into the  forest and started alone, on foot, for the Southwest, his head full of  romantic ideas about the beauty of primitive civilization, or absence  of civilization, put there no doubt by Jean Jacques Rousseau, of whom  he was an ardent admirer and a disciple. We are told that one evening  in an Indian wigwam he discovered a torn page of an English newspaper  and read of the ravages of the Revolution and the flight and arrest  of Louis XVI. His loyalty was awakened, and after two years of  sentimental wanderings in the forests of the Mississippi valley he  returned to France and enlisted with the Royalists. They received him  with suspicion, and even after his recovery, in exile, from a severe  wound received in their cause, they refused him fellowship. He lived  in London and Belgium and the island of Jersey, composing his first  work, an «Essai sur les Révolutions», 1797, in which his ideas,  both of politics and of religion, are still in a line with those of  Rousseau. Shortly after its publication some inward experience of the  reality of life and its dependence upon God gave him an impulsion in a  new direction, and he began his great apology for the Christian faith,  entitled «Le Génie du Christianisme», 1802, of which «Atala» and  «René» are only episodes. At this time Napoleon was re-establishing  order, and as he considered religion necessary to political security,  and was just then courting the Pope, he showered favors upon the young  author, to the latter's manifest harm, for they made him fickle  and ambitious, and turned his natural sentimentality into the most  repulsive egoism. His masterpiece was «Les Martyrs», a sort of  Christian epic, which appeared in 1809; and thereafter he was regarded  as the leader in a conservative reaction back to Rome and back to  royalty.    Alphonse de Lamartine was a poet of greater significance, though  in his early years he stood in a secondary place, owing to  Chateaubriand's influence with the clerical and royalist party, and  indeed with all those who longed for peace and a revival of religious  faith in France. His early life was as interesting as Chateaubriand's,  and, like his, its years of transition from boyhood to active manhood  were spent in foreign lands. His poetry is characterized by a certain  softness and sweetness peculiar to itself, reminding one somewhat of  English Cowper. It is contemplative and religious; but that does not  say all, for its range is wide, and Wordsworth has demonstrated to us  what a world of thought and fancy there may be in meditative poetry.  The chief of his works are: the volume entitled «Les Meditations»,  which contains that fine poem «Le Lac»; «Les Harmonies»; «Jocelyn»;  «La Chute d'un Ange»; «Graziella»; «Voyage en Orient», and «L'Histoire  des Girondins». Lamartine succeeded in being a guide to his people in  so far as he attracted them by his beautiful verse to a more serious  contemplation of themselves and the world, to a renewed interest in  true religion, to an appreciation of the fact that Christianity was  still alive and capable of inspiring enthusiasm. The feeling had  prevailed in France that vital Christianity was incompatible with the  cultivation of the fine arts. Lamartine proved this to be untrue.  He failed, however, when it came to writing history or engaging in  politics, because, as Lowell long ago perceived, and as people now  generally acknowledge, Lamartine was a sentimentalist, that is, a man  who cultivated fine sentiments because they were beautiful and not  because they were right, and who performed fine actions to be seen of  men; in other words, an egoist, an artist spoiled by artificiality.  Apart, however, from all question of the intrinsic merit of his work,  his tendency was, like that of Chateaubriand, in the direction of  recognizing religion and looking back to monarchical rather than  republican France for inspiration and example.    Félicité de Lamennais lived a life whose details belong as much to the  history of philosophy, or to ecclesiastical history, as to that of  belles-lettres. First a priest, and the most ardent Catholic in  France, he afterward turned against Rome and led a movement towards  religious independence. There are few more interesting figures,  chiefly because great religious leaders have been so rare in modern  France. At the time when Victor Hugo was beginning to write, Lamennais  was ardently engaged in an effort to establish the supremacy of Rome,  not only over private conscience, but over political institutions, and  although from his subsequent actions he is known to the world as a  liberal and a heretic, yet at that time, having published in 1817 his  «Essai sur l'Indifférence en Matière de Religion», he was the most  jealous conservative and the most fiery churchman in France.    Thus a superficial glance has sufficed to show that the first movement  which stirred literary France after 1815 was a reaction in favor of  monarchy and Rome; that its champions were Chateaubriand, Lamartine,  and Lamennais; that its effort was mainly through poetry; that its  honor was its high political and moral purity; that its defect was its  sentimentality; that its ultimate inefficacy was due to its running  counter to the tendency of the age. Into this movement Victor Hugo  inevitably fell; by it he was for a long time carried; with it he at  first kept step bravely.    At this point let us take a glance at Victor Hugo's early life. He was  born in 1802, of respectable and educated parents. His father was an  army officer of increasing distinction under the Empire; his mother a  sympathizer with the exiled Bourbons. During Victor's early childhood  he, with his mother and brothers, moved about through Italy, following  his father's campaignings under "]]]
