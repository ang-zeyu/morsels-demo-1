Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#2)"],[1," an excellent foundation  from which to obtain variety in the _diet_--by which in these lessons is  meant the daily food and drink of any individual, and not something  prescribed by a physician for a person who is ill--for then it is simply  a matter of putting a little careful thought into the work she is doing  in order to get ideas of new ways in which to prepare these same foods  and of utilizing foodstuffs she has on hand. However, ample time must  always be allowed for the preparation of meals, for no one can expect to  produce tasty meals by rushing into the kitchen just before meal time  and getting up the easiest thing in the quickest manner. Well-planned  meals carefully prepared will stimulate interest in the next day's bill  of fare and will prove extremely beneficial to all concerned.    6. In the practice of cookery it is also important that the meals be  planned and the cooking done for the sake of building the human body  and caring for it. As soon as any woman realizes that both the present  and the future welfare of the persons for whom she is providing foods  depend on so many things that are included in cookery, her interest in  this branch of domestic science will increase; and in making a study of  it she may rest assured that there is possibly no other calling that  affords a more constant source of enjoyment and a better opportunity for  acquiring knowledge, displaying skill, and helping others to be well  and happy.    The fact that people constantly desire something new and different in  the way of food offers the housewife a chance to develop her ingenuity  along this line. Then, too, each season brings with it special foods for  enjoyment and nourishment, and there is constant satisfaction in  providing the family with some surprise in the form of a dish to which  they are unaccustomed, or an old one prepared in a new or a better way.  But the pleasure need not be one-sided, for the adding of some new touch  to each meal will give as much delight to the one who prepares the food  as to those who partake of it. When cookery is thought of in this way,  it is really a creative art and has for its object something more than  the making of a single dish or the planning of a single meal.    7. From what has been pointed out, it will readily be seen that a  correct knowledge of cookery and all that it implies is of extreme  importance to those who must prepare food for others; indeed, it is for  just such persons--the housewife who must solve cookery problems from  day to day, as well as girls and women who must prepare themselves to  perform the duties with which they will be confronted when they take up  the management of a household and its affairs--that these lessons in  cookery are intended.    In the beginning of this course of study in cookery it is deemed  advisable to call attention to the order in which the subject matter is  presented. As will be seen before much progress is made, the lessons are  arranged progressively; that is, the instruction begins with the  essentials, or important fundamentals, of food--its selection,  preparation, and care--and, from these as a foundation, advances step by  step into the more complicated matters and minor details. The beginner  eager to take up the actual work of cookery may feel that too much  attention is given to preliminaries. However, these are extremely  essential, for they are the groundwork on which the actual cooking of  food depends; indeed, without a knowledge of them, very little  concerning cookery in its various phases could be readily comprehended.    8. Each beginner in cookery is therefore urged to master every lesson in  the order in which she receives it and to carry out diligently every  detail. No lesson should be disregarded as soon as it is understood, for  the instruction given in it bears a close relation to the entire subject  and should be continually put into practice as progress is made. This  thought applies with particular emphasis to the Sections relating to the  essentials of cookery. These should be used in connection with all other  Sections as books of reference and an aid in calling to mind points that  must eventually become a part of a woman's cookery knowledge. By  carrying on her studies systematically and following directions  carefully, the beginner will find the cooking of foods a simple matter  and will take delight in putting into practice the many things that  she learns.           *       *       *       *       *    SELECTION OF FOOD    MATTERS INVOLVED IN RIGHT SELECTION    9. Each one of the phases of cookery has its importance, but if success  is to be achieved in this art, careful attention must be given to the  selection of what is to be cooked, so as to determine its value and  suitability. To insure the best selection, therefore, the housewife  should decide whether the food material she purchases will fit the needs  of the persons who are to eat it; whether the amount of labor involved  in the preparation will be too great in proportion to the results  obtained; whether the loss in preparation, that is, the proportion of  refuse to edible matter, will be sufficient to affect the cost  materially; what the approximate loss in cooking will be; whether the  food will serve to the best advantage after it is cooked; and, finally,  whether or not all who are to eat it will like it. The market price also  is a factor that cannot be disregarded, for, as has been explained, it  is important to keep within the limits of the amount that may be spent  and at the same time provide the right kind of nourishment for each  member of the family.    10. In order to select food material that will meet the requirements  just set forth, three important matters must be considered; namely, the  _substances_ of which it is composed; its measure of energy-producing  material, or what is called its _food_, or _fuel, value_; and its  _digestion_ and _absorption_. Until these are understood, the actual  cost of any article of food cannot be properly determined, although its  price at all times may be known.    However, before a study of any of these matters is entered into, it is  necessary to know just what is meant by food and what food does for the  body. As is well understood, the body requires material by which it may  be built and its tissues repaired when they are torn down by work and  exercise. In addition it requires a supply of heat to maintain it at  normal temperature and provide it with sufficient energy to do the work  required of it. The material that will accomplish these important things  is food, which may therefore be regarded as anything that, when taken  into the body, will build and repair its tissues or will furnish it with  the energy required to do its work.      FOOD SUBSTANCES    11. Although, as has just been stated, food may be considered as  anything that the human engine can make over into tissue or use in  living and working, not all foods are equally desirable any more than  all materials are equally good in the construction of a steam engine and  in the production of its working power. Those food substances which are  the most wholesome and healthful are the ones to be chosen, but proper  choice cannot be made unless the buyer knows of what the particular food  consists and what it is expected to do. To aid in the selection of food,  therefore, it is extremely necessary to become familiar with the five  substances, constituents, or principles of which foods are made up;  namely, water, mineral matter, or ash, protein, fat, and carbohydrate. A  knowledge of these will help also in determining the cooking methods to  adopt, for this depends on the effect that heat has on the various  substances present in a food. Of course, so far as flavor is concerned,  it is possible for the experienced cook to prepare many dishes  successfully without knowing the effect of heat on the different food  constituents; but to cook intelligently, with that success which makes  for actual economy and digestibility, certain facts must be known  concerning the food principles and the effect of dry and moist heat  on foods.    12. Water.--Of the various constituents that are found in the human  body, water occurs in the largest quantity. As a food substance, it is  an extremely important feature of a person's diet. Its chief purpose is  to replenish the liquids of the body and to assist in the digestion of  food. Although nature provides considerable amounts of water in most  foods, large quantities must be taken in the diet as a beverage. In  fact, it is the need of the body for water that has led to the  development of numerous beverages. Besides being necessary in building  up the body and keeping it in a healthy condition, water has a special  function to perform in cooking, as is explained later. Although this  food substance is extremely essential to life, it is seldom considered  in the selection of food, because, as has just been mentioned, nearly  all foods contain water.    13. Mineral Matter.--Ranking next to water in the quantity contained in  the human body is mineral matter. This constituent, which is also called  _ash_ or _mineral salts_, forms the main part of the body's framework,  or skeleton. In the building and maintaining of the body, mineral salts  serve three purposes--to give rigidity and permanence to the skeleton,  to form an essential element of active tissue, and to provide the  required alkalinity or acidity for the digestive juices and other  secretions.    The origin and distribution of these mineral substances are of interest.  Plants in their growth seize from the earth the salts of minerals and  combine them with other substances that make up their living tissue.  Then human beings, as well as other living creatures, get their supply  of these needed salts from the plants that they take as food, this being  the only form in which the salts can be thoroughly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#2)"],[1,"on the ingredients of which they are composed. With an  understanding of the composition of the ingredients used in salads, the  housewife will be able to judge fairly accurately whether the salad is  low, medium, or high in food value, and whether it is high in protein,  fat, or carbohydrate. This matter is important, and should receive  consideration from all who prepare this class of food.    7. PROTEIN IN SALADS.--As may be expected, salads that are high in  protein have for their basis, or contain, such ingredients as meat,  fish, fowl, cheese, eggs, nuts, or dried beans. The amount of protein  that such a salad contains naturally varies with the quantity of  high-protein food that is used. For instance, a salad that has  hard-cooked eggs for its foundation contains considerable protein, but  one in which a slice or two of hard-cooked egg is used for a garnish  cannot be said to be a high-protein salad.    8. FAT IN SALADS.--The fat in salads is more often included as a part of  the dressing than in any other way, but the quantity introduced may be  very large. A French dressing or a mayonnaise dressing, as a rule,  contains a sufficient proportion of some kind of oil to make the salad  in which it is used somewhat high in fat. In fact, salads are often used  as a means of introducing fat into a meal, and whenever this is done  they should be considered as one of the dishes that supply  energy-producing food material to the meals in which they are served.    9. CARBOHYDRATE IN SALADS.--For the most part, salads do not contain  carbohydrate in any quantity. If fruits are used, the salad will, of  course, contain a certain amount of sugar. Salads in which potatoes,  peas, beets, and other vegetables are used also contain starch or sugar  in varying quantities. However, with the exception of potato salad,  salads are probably never taken as a source of carbohydrate.    10. MINERAL SALTS IN SALADS.--In the majority of salads, mineral salts  are an important ingredient. Meat and fish salads are the only ones in  which the mineral salts are not especially desirable, but they can be  improved in this respect if a certain amount of vegetables are mixed  with them. Green-vegetable salads are the most valuable sources of  mineral salts, and fruit salads come next. In addition, these two  varieties of salads contain vitamines, which are substances necessary to  maintain health. Cheese and egg salads, which are high-protein salads,  are also valuable for the vitamines they supply.    11. CELLULOSE IN SALADS.--Vegetable and fruit salads serve to supply  cellulose in the diet. Unless the meals contain sufficient cellulose in  some other form, the use of such salads is an excellent way in which to  introduce this material. Of course, the salads composed of foods high in  cellulose are lower in food value than others, but the salad dressing  usually helps to make up for this deficiency.      INGREDIENTS OF SALADS    12. VARIETY IN SALAD INGREDIENTS.--One of the advantages of salads is  that the ingredients from which they can be made are large in number. In  fact, almost any cooked or raw fruit or vegetable, or any meat, fowl, or  fish, whether cooked expressly for this purpose or left over from a  previous meal, may be utilized in the making of salads. Canned foods of  these varieties may also be used to advantage for salads during the  winter when fresh foods are expensive and difficult to procure. The idea  that such foods cannot be used is wrong.    13. As far as meats are concerned, they are not used so extensively in  salads as are fruits and vegetables. Often, however, veal or pork may be  used to increase the quantity of material needed to make certain salads,  such as chicken salad. Canned fish or fish freshly cooked makes  appetizing salads, and if there is not a sufficient quantity of one kind  on hand, another may be added without impairing the quality of  the salad.    14. As has already been stated, almost any vegetable, raw, canned, or  freshly cooked, can be used in the making of salads. In addition, these  vegetables may be combined in almost any way. Small amounts of two,  three, four, or more vegetables may be combined with an appetizing salad  dressing and served as a luncheon or dinner salad. If no definite recipe  is followed but whatever material that happens to be on hand is  utilized, the result is not only an appetizing salad, but a saving of  vegetables that might otherwise be wasted.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    15. Fruits, both canned and raw, are largely used in the making of  salads. As with vegetables, almost any combination of them makes a  delicious salad when served with the proper dressing. Thus, a slice of  pineapple, a canned peach or two, or a few spoonfuls of cherries may be  added to grapefruit, oranges, bananas, or whatever fruit may happen to  be most convenient or easy to procure and served with the salad dressing  that is preferred. Vegetables are seldom used with fruits, celery being  the only one that is ever employed in this way. On the other hand, nuts  are much used with fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish in the making of  salads and any variety may be utilized.    16. SALAD GARNISHES.--The garnishing of salads, while it may seem to be  an unimportant part of the preparation of this food, is really a matter  that demands considerable attention. Lettuce is used oftenest for this  purpose, but almost any edible green, such as endive, watercress, etc.,  makes an excellent garnish. Generally when lettuce is the garnish, the  leaves are used whole, but if they are not in good condition for  garnishing or if use is to be made of the coarse outside leaves of the  stalks, they may be arranged in a pile, rolled tight, and then, as  shown in Fig. 1, cut with a sharp knife into narrow strips. Lettuce  prepared in this way is said to be _shredded_, and a bed of it makes a  very attractive garnish for many kinds of salad. Among the other foods  used as a garnish are certain vegetables that give a contrast in color,  such as pimiento, green peppers, radishes, and olives. Slices of  hard-cooked eggs or the yolks of eggs forced through a ricer likewise  offer a touch of attractive color.    17. NATURE OF SALAD DRESSINGS.--When a salad is properly made, a salad  dressing of some kind is usually added to the ingredients that are  selected for the salad. This dressing generally has for its chief  ingredient a salad oil of some kind, many satisfactory varieties of  which are to be found on the market. Olive oil has always been the most  popular oil used for this purpose, and in many respects it is the most  desirable. It can be obtained in several grades, the price varying with  the excellence of the quality. The best grades have a yellowish color,  the poorest ones are somewhat green, and those of medium quality shade  between these two colors. The best grades are also clear, while the  poorer ones are usually cloudy, the better the quality the less cloudy  the oil. Besides olive oil, however, there are oils made of cottonseed,  corn, and nuts. Many of these products are cheaper than olive oil and  are almost, if not quite, as satisfactory. In combination with the oil  that is used for salad dressing, there is always an acid of some kind,  such as vinegar or lemon juice. To these ingredients are added spices  and flavoring. Such a dressing is prepared without cooking, the  ingredients being combined by proper mixing or beating.    18. Another kind of dressing that is much used is known as boiled salad  dressing. Its ingredients are similar to those used in the uncooked  salad dressing, but usually less fat is employed and eggs alone or eggs  and some starchy material are used for thickening.    Then, again, entirely different kinds of dressing may be made for fruit  salads. Sometimes these dressings contain no fat, and other times they  have for their basis sweet or sour cream, but usually they are made so  that they are somewhat acid to the taste.      RELATION OF SALADS TO MEALS    19. Because of the large variety of ingredients that may be used in the  making of salads, it is usually possible to make the salad correspond  properly with the other dishes in the meal. This is a little more  difficult to accomplish when left-over materials are used in salads,  but, even in this event, the addition of ingredients that will make the  salad more nearly approach what must be supplied is usually possible. If  the meal is to be a light one and the salad is to serve as the principal  dish, it should be sufficiently heavy and contain enough food value to  serve the purpose for which it is intended. It should be decided on  first, and then the rest of the dishes should be planned to correspond  with the salad.    On the other hand, when the meal is a heavy one and the salad is to be  one of the lighter dishes, the main dishes should be decided on first  and the salad planned so that it will correspond properly with the other  dishes. For instance, with meat or fish as the main course of the meal,  a fish, egg, or cheese salad would obviously be the wrong thing to  serve. Instead, a light salad of vegetables or fruits should be selected  for such a meal. It should be remembered, also, that if the other dishes  of a meal contain sufficient food value to make the meal properly  nourishing, a salad containing a rich dressing will provide more than a  sufficient supply of calories and consequently should be avoided.    20. Another point that should not be neglected in selecting a salad is  that it should be a contrast to the rest of the meal as far as flavor is  concerned. While several foods acid in flavor do not necessarily  unbalance a meal so far as food substances and food value are concerned,  they provide too much of the same flavor to be agreeable to most  persons. For instance, if the meal contains an acid soup, such as  tomato, and a vegetable with a sour dressing, such as beets, then "]]]
