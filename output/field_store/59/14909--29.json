And Joab and his men went             all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.    10:003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house             of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house             of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.    10:003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was             Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;    10:003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the             Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the             daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;    10:003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,             Shephatiah the son of Abital;    10:003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born             to David in Hebron.    10:003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of             Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong             for the house of Saul.    10:003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter             of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou             gone in unto my father's concubine?    10:003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and             said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness             this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,             and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand             of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning             this woman?    10:003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath             sworn to David, even so I do to him;    10:003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up             the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even             to Beersheba.    10:003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared             him.    10:003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,             Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,             behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel             unto thee.    10:003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one             thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,             except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou             comest to see my face.    10:003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,             Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an             hundred foreskins of the Philistines.    10:003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from             Phaltiel the son of Laish.    10:003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to             Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he             returned.    10:003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,             Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:    10:003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By             the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out             of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all             their enemies.    10:003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went             also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed             good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of             Benjamin.    10:003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And             David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.    10:003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will             gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a             league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that             thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went             in peace.    10:003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing             a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was             not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was             gone in peace.    10:003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they             told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and             he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.    10:003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?             behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent             him away, and he is quite gone?    10:003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive             thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know             all that thou doest.    10:003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers             after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:             but David knew it not.    10:003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in             the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under             the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his             brother.    10:003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom             are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner             the son of Ner:    10:003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's             house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that             hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,             or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.    10:003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had             slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.    10:003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with             him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn             before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.    10:003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his             voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people             wept.    10:003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a             fool dieth?    10:003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a             man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the             people wept again over him.    10:003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while             it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more             also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.    10:003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as             whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.    10:003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it             was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.    10:003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is             a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?    10:003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men             the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward             the doer of evil according to his wickedness.    10:004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his             hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.    10:004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the             name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,             the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:             (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.    10:004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there             until this day.)    10:004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.             He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and             Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:             and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,             and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.    10:004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,             went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of             Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.    10:004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though             they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the             fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.    10:004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his             bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded             him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain             all night.    10:004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,             and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of             Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath             avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.    10:004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of             Rimmon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#2)"],[1,"have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast             strengthened the feeble knees.    18:004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth             thee, and thou art troubled.    18:004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the             uprightness of thy ways?    18:004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or             where were the righteous cut off?    18:004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow             wickedness, reap the same.    18:004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his             nostrils are they consumed.    18:004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and             the teeth of the young lions, are broken.    18:004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's             whelps are scattered abroad.    18:004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received             a little thereof.    18:004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep             falleth on men,    18:004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to             shake.    18:004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh             stood up:    18:004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an             image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a             voice, saying,    18:004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more             pure than his maker?    18:004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he             charged with folly:    18:004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose             foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?    18:004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for             ever without any regarding it.    18:004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,             even without wisdom.    18:005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which             of the saints wilt thou turn?    18:005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly             one.    18:005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his             habitation.    18:005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the             gate, neither is there any to deliver them.    18:005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of             the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.    18:005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth             trouble spring out of the ground;    18:005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.    18:005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:    18:005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things             without number:    18:005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the             fields:    18:005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn             may be exalted to safety.    18:005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their             hands cannot perform their enterprise.    18:005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of             the froward is carried headlong.    18:005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the             noonday as in the night.    18:005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and             from the hand of the mighty.    18:005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.    18:005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore             despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:    18:005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands             make whole.    18:005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there             shall no evil touch thee.    18:005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the             power of the sword.    18:005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither             shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.    18:005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou             be afraid of the beasts of the earth.    18:005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and             the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.    18:005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and             thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.    18:005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine             offspring as the grass of the earth.    18:005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of             corn cometh in in his season.    18:005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou             it for thy good.    18:006:001 But Job answered and said,    18:006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid             in the balances together!    18:006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:             therefore my words are swallowed up.    18:006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison             whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set             themselves in array against me.    18:006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox             over his fodder?    18:006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there             any taste in the white of an egg?    18:006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful             meat.    18:006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me             the thing that I long for!    18:006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let             loose his hand, and cut me off!    18:006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in             sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words             of the Holy One.    18:006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,             that I should prolong my life?    18:006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of             brass?    18:006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?    18:006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his             friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.    18:006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the             stream of brooks they pass away;    18:006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow             is hid:    18:006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are             consumed out of their place.    18:006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,             and perish.    18:006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for             them.    18:006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came             thither, and were ashamed.    18:006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are             afraid.    18:006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your             substance?    18:006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the             hand of the mighty?    18:006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to             understand wherein I have erred.    18:006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing             reprove?    18:006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that             is desperate, which are as wind?    18:006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your             friend.    18:006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto             you if I lie.    18:006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,             my righteousness is in it.    18:006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern             perverse things?    18:007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his             days also like the days of an hireling?    18:007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling             looketh for the reward of his work:    18:007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights             are appointed to me.    18:007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be             gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of             the day.    18:007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is             broken, and become loathsome.    18:007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent             without hope.    18:007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see             good.    18:007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine             eyes are upon me, and I am not.    18:007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth             down to the grave shall come up no more.    18:007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place             know him any more.    18:007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the             anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my             soul.    18:007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?    18:007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my             complaints;    18:007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through"]]]
