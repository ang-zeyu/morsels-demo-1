These I shall describe in due  course, when I come to speak of their other grievances. For the present  let it suffice to have shown that this excuse for the sale of one's  liberty is as untenable as the former.    And now for the true reason, which you will never hear from their lips.  Voluptuousness and a whole pack of desires are what induce them to force  their way into great houses. The dazzling spectacle of abundant gold and  silver, the joys of high feeding and luxurious living, the immediate  prospect of wallowing in riches, with no man to say them nay,--these are  the temptations that lure them on, and make slaves of free men; not lack  of the necessaries of life, as they pretend, but lust of its  superfluities, greed of its costly refinements. And their employers, like  finished coquettes, exercise their rigours upon these hapless slaves of  love, and keep them for ever dangling in amorous attendance; but for  fruition, no! never so much as a kiss may they snatch. To grant that  would be to give the lover his release, a conclusion against which they  are jealously on their guard. But upon hopes he is abundantly fed.  Despair might else cure his ardent passion, and the lover be lover no  more. So there are smiles for him, and promises; always something shall  be done, some favour shall be granted, a handsome provision shall be made  for him,--some day. Meanwhile, old age steals upon the pair; the  superannuated lover ceases from desire, and his mistress has nothing left  to give. Life has gone by, and all they have to show for it is _hope_.    Well now, that a man for the sake of pleasure should put up with every  hardship is perhaps no great matter. Devoted to this one object, he can  think of nothing, but how to procure it. Let that pass. Though it seems  but a scurvy bargain, a bargain for a slave; to sell one's liberty for  pleasures far less pleasant than liberty itself. Still, as I say, let  that pass, provided the price is paid. But to endure unlimited pain,  merely in the hope that pleasure may come of it, this surely is carrying  folly to the height of absurdity. And men do it with their eyes open. The  hardships, they know, are certain, unmistakable, inevitable. As to the  pleasure, that vague, hypothetic pleasure, they have never had it in all  these years, and in all reasonable probability they never will. The  comrades of Odysseus forgot all else in the Lotus: but it was while they  were tasting its sweets. They esteemed lightly of Honour: but it was in  the immediate presence of Pleasure. In men so occupied, such forgetfulness  was not wholly unnatural. But to dwell a prisoner, with Famine for  company, to watch one's neighbour fattening on the Lotus, and keeping it  all to himself, and to forget Honour and Virtue in the bare prospect of a  possible mouthful,--by Heaven, it is too absurd, and calls in good truth  for Homeric scourgings.    Such, as nearly as I can describe them, are men's motives for taking  service with the rich, for handing themselves over bodily, to be used as  their employers think fit. There is one class, however, of which I ought  perhaps to make mention--those whose vanity is gratified by the mere fact  of being seen in the company of well-born and well-dressed men. For there  are those who consider this a distinguished privilege; though for my own  part I would not give a fig to enjoy and to be seen enjoying the company  of the King of Persia, if I was to get nothing by it.    And now, since we understand what it is that these men would be at, let  us mentally review their whole career;--the difficulties that beset the  applicant before he gains acceptance; his condition when he is duly  installed in his office; and the closing scene of his life's drama. You  may perhaps suppose that his situation, whatever its drawbacks, is at  least attainable without much trouble; that you have but to will it, and  the thing is done in a trice. Far from it. Much tramping about is in  store for you, much kicking of heels. You will rise early, and stand long  before your patron's closed door; you will be jostled; you will hear  occasional comments on your impudence. You will be exposed to the vile  gabble of a Syrian porter, and to the extortions of a Libyan nomenclator,  whose memory must be fee'd, if he is not to forget your name. You must  dress beyond your means, or you will be a discredit to your patron; and  select his favourite colours, or you will be out of harmony with your  surroundings. Finally, you will be indefatigable in following his steps,  or rather in preceding them, for you will be thrust forward by his  slaves, to swell his triumphal progress. And for days together you will  not be favoured with a glance.    But one day the best befalls you. You catch his eye; he beckons you to  him, and puts a random question. In that supreme moment what cold sweats,  what palpitations, what untimely tremors are yours! and what mirth is  theirs who witness your confusion! 'Who was the king of the Achaeans?' is  the question: and your answer, as likely as not, 'A thousand sail.' With  the charitable this passes for bashfulness; but to the impudent you are a  craven, and to the ill-natured a yokel. This first experience teaches you  that the condescensions of the great are not unattended with danger; and  as you depart you pronounce upon yourself a sentence of utter despair.  Thereafter,      many a sleepless night,    Many a day of strife shall be thy lot--    not for the sake of Helen, not for the towers of Troy, but for the  sevenpence halfpenny of your desire. At length some heaven-sent protector  gives you an introduction: the scholar is brought up for examination. For  the great man, who has but to receive your flatteries and compliments,  this is an agreeable pastime: for you, it is a life-and-death struggle;  all is hazarded on the one throw. For it will of course occur to you,  that if you are rejected at the first trial, you will never pass current  with any one else. A thousand different feelings now distract you. You  are jealous of your rivals (for we will assume that there is competition  for the post); you are dissatisfied with your own replies; you hope; you  fear; you cannot remove your eye from the countenance of your judge. Does  he pooh-pooh your efforts? You are a lost man. Was that a smile? You  rejoice, and hope rises high. It is only to be expected, that many of the  company are your enemies, and others your rivals, and each has his secret  shaft to let fly at you from his lurking-place. What a picture! The  venerable grey-beard being put through his paces. Is he any use? Some say  yes, others no. Time is taken for consideration. Your antecedents are  industriously overhauled. Some envious compatriot, some neighbour with a  trivial grievance, is asked his opinion; he has but to drop a word of  'loose morality,' and your business is done; 'the man speaks God's  truth!' Every one else may testify to your character: their evidence  proves nothing; they are suspected; they are venal. The fact is, you must  gain every point; there must be no hitch anywhere. That is your only  chance of success.    And now, take it that you _have_ succeeded--beyond all expectation.  Your words have found favour with the great man. Those friends, by whose  judgement in such matters he sets most store, have made no attempt to  alter his decision. His wife approves his choice; the steward and the  major-domo have neither of them anything against you. No aspersions have  been cast on your character; all is propitious, every omen is in your  favour. Hail, mighty conqueror, wreathed in the Olympian garland! Babylon  is yours, Sardis falls before you. The horn of plenty is within your  grasp; pigeons shall yield you milk.    Now, if your crown is to be of anything better than leaves, there must be  some solid benefits to compensate you for the labours you have undergone.  A considerable salary will be placed at your disposal, and you will draw  upon it without ceremony, whenever you have occasion. You will be a  privileged person in every respect. As for toils, and muddy tramps, and  wakeful nights, the time for those have gone by. Your prayers have been  heard: you will take your ease, and sleep your fill. You will do the work  you were engaged to do, and not a stroke besides. This, indeed, is what  you have a right to expect. There would be no great hardship in bowing  one's neck to a yoke so light, so easy--and so superbly gilded. But alas,  Timocles, many, nay all of these requirements are unsatisfied. Your  office, now that you have got it, is attended with a thousand details  insufferable to all but slaves. Let me rehearse them to you; you shall  judge for yourself whether any man with the slightest pretence to culture  would endure such treatment.    Let me begin with your first invitation to dinner, which may reasonably  be expected to follow, as an earnest of the patronage to come. It is  brought to you by a most communicative slave, whose goodwill it must be  your first care to secure. Five shillings is the least you can slip into  his palm, if you would do the thing properly. He has scruples. 'Really,  sir--couldn't think of it; no, indeed, sir.' But he is prevailed upon at  last, and goes off, grinning from ear to ear. You then look out your best  clothes, have your bath, make yourself as presentable as possible, and  arrive--in fear and trembling lest you should be the first, which would  wear an awkward air, just as it savours of ostentation to arrive last.  Accordingly you contrive to hit on the right moment, are received with  every attention, and shown to your place, a little above the host,  separated from him only by a couple of his intimates. And now you feel as  if you were in heaven. You are all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#2)"],[1,"world and the stage.
