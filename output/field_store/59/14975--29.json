Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#2)"],[1,"a mental effect,  is just as real and just as valuable as the actual stimulation of  the acids.    4. Many fruits are eaten raw, while others are cooked either because  they require cooking to make them appetizing or because it is desired  not to use them in their raw state. The cooking of fruits has a variety  of effects on them, being sometimes advantageous and other times  detrimental. The flavor is always changed by the application of heat,  and in some cases the acid that fruit contains becomes stronger. On the  other hand, the fibrous material, or cellulose, of fruits is softened by  cooking and thus becomes more digestible. Then, too, the sugar that is  usually added to fruits in their cooking increases their food value.  Because of these facts, cooked fruits have considerable value and, like  raw fruits, should have an important place in the diet. Those fruits  which are dried and usually eaten raw, such as figs and dates, supply  much nourishment in an easily digestible form.    5. The medicinal value of fruit has long been considered to be of  importance, but this may be almost entirely disregarded, for, with the  exception of the fact that most fruits are valuable as a laxative, there  is nothing to consider. However, several fruits, such as blackberries  and bananas, have an anti-laxative effect, and large quantities of  these should for the most part be avoided, especially in the feeding  of children.    6. In general, fruits are divided into two classes, namely, food fruits  and flavor fruits. As their names imply, _food fruits_ are valuable as  food, whereas _flavor fruits_ are those distinguished by a  characteristic flavor. It should be remembered that the flavors, as well  as the odors, of fruits, are due chiefly to what is known as their  volatile, or ethereal, oils. Fruits in which these oils are very strong  are often irritating to certain persons and cause distress of some sort  after eating.    7. In this Section, it is the purpose to acquaint the housewife with the  relative value and uses of the various kinds of fruit, to teach her the  best methods of preparation, and to supply her with recipes that will  encourage her to make greater use of this valuable food in her family's  diet. In this discussion, however, the general classification of fruits  is not followed. Instead, the various fruits are arranged alphabetically  under the headings Berries, Non-Tropical Fruits, Citrus Fruits, Tropical  Fruits, Melons, and Dried Fruits, in order to simplify matters. While it  is hardly possible to use fruits too extensively, they must not be  allowed to take the place of other more nourishing foods that are  required by the body. Therefore, in order to make proper use of them,  their value in the diet should not be overlooked.           *       *       *       *       *    NATURE OF FRUITS    ADVANCE IN FRUIT CULTIVATION    8. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between vegetables and  fruits. For instance, the tomato is in reality a fruit, but it is  commonly used as a vegetable, and rhubarb is more of a vegetable than a  fruit, but it is always used as a fruit. It can therefore be seen that  the line between vegetables and fruits is not clearly drawn. It is well  to remember that fruit is usually the edible pulpy mass covering the  seeds of various plants and trees, and that it is generally cooked or  eaten raw with sugar, whereas vegetables are seldom sweetened  in cooking.    9. Great strides have been made in the cultivation of fruit. Many  varieties that formerly grew wild are now commonly cultivated. Most of  the cultivated fruits are superior to the same kind in the wild state,  at least in size and appearance, but often there seems to be a loss of  flavor. Through cultivation, some fruits that were almost inedible in  their wild state on account of containing so many seeds have been made  seedless. Also, through cross-cultivation, varieties of fruit different  from what formerly existed have been obtained. An example of such fruit  is the loganberry which is a cross between a red raspberry and a  blackberry and retains many of the qualities of each. However, some  small fruits, such as blueberries, or huckleberries, are still grown  wild and marketed only from their wild source.    10. While fruit is usually improved by cultivation, there has been a  tendency through this means to produce fruits that will stand up for  long periods of time, so that they may be marketed at great distances  from the place where they are grown. For instance, apples, especially  those found in the market in the spring, and other fruits, which look  very fine, will many times be found to have a tough skin and to be  almost tasteless.    In general, fruits of delicate flavor and texture cannot be kept very  long after they have ripened. To stand shipping, they must be picked in  their green stage; then if they are kept in the right temperature they  will ripen after picking. Bananas that are to be shipped a long distance  are picked when perfectly green, but by the time the consumer buys them  they are usually well ripened. In addition to bananas, a few other  tropical fruits are shipped out of their native climates in small  numbers and are sold at very high prices. However, many tropical fruits  cannot be shipped to the Northern States because of their  perishable nature.           *       *       *       *       *    COMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF FRUITS    COMPOSITION OF FRUITS    11. The composition of fruits is a matter of considerable importance,  for on it the food value of the fruits depends. To a certain extent, the  composition of all fruits is the same, but the varieties of this food  differ in their food values almost as greatly as do vegetables. Many of  them are extremely low in this respect, while a few of them are rather  high. In order to determine the place that fruit should have in a meal,  it is necessary to obtain a definite idea of the composition as well as  the food value of the different varieties.    12. PROTEIN AND FAT IN FRUITS.--Such small quantities of protein and fat  are contained in fruits that very little attention need be given to  these substances. Exceptions are found in avocados, or alligator pears,  and in ripe olives, both of which are high in fat. Then, too, there is a  small amount of protein in grapes and some other fruits, but it is not  sufficient to merit consideration.    13. CARBOHYDRATE IN FRUIT.--Whatever food value fruits may have, whether  it be high or low, is due to the carbohydrate they contain. Some green  fruits and bananas contain a very small amount of starch, but on the  whole the carbohydrate of fruits is in the form of sugar and is in  solution in the fruit juices. The chief form of this carbohydrate is  known as _levulose_, or _fruit sugar_. However, _glucose_, another form  of sugar, is also found in nearly all fruits, grapes and dried fruits,  such as figs, raisins, etc., containing an unusually large amount. In  addition, _cane sugar_ is contained in the majority of fruits. _Pectin_  is also a carbohydrate that is found in large quantities in some fruits,  while in other fruits it is lacking. This substance is related to the  gums and to cellulose. Although it is one of the carbohydrates from  which no food value is derived, it is of considerable importance,  because it is responsible for the jelly-making properties of fruits.    14. In fruits that are not fully matured, or, in other words, green  fruits, the sugar has not developed to so great an extent as it has in  perfectly ripe fruits. Consequently, such fruits are not so high in food  value as they are when they become ripe. As is well known, it is the  sugar of fruits that accounts for their sweet taste, for the sweeter the  fruits, the more sugar and the less acid they contain. The quantity of  this substance varies from 1 per cent. in lemons to 20 per cent. in some  other fresh fruits, such as plums. In dried fruits, the amount of sugar  is much higher, reaching as high as 60 per cent. or even more in such  fruits as figs, dates, and raisins.    15. CELLULOSE IN FRUIT.--In fruits, as in vegetables, cellulose is found  in varying quantities. The larger the quantity, the lower will be the  food value of the fruit, except where the water has been evaporated, as  in the case of dried fruits. The digestibility of this cellulose,  however, is not worth considering, for, while it is possible that small  amounts of very young and tender cellulose from fruits may be digested,  on the whole this characteristic may be disregarded. The skins and seeds  of fruits, as well as the coarse material that helps to make up the  pulp, are known as refuse and are treated as such by the human digestive  tract; but it is to this waste material, or cellulose, that the laxative  quality of fruit is largely due.    In cases where there are digestive or intestinal troubles, it is often  necessary to remove the cellulose before the fruit is eaten. The coarse  material may be removed and that which is more tender may be broken up  by pressing the fruit through a sieve or a strainer of some kind. The  cooking of fruits is another means of making the cellulose in them more  easily digested, for it softens, or disintegrates, the various particles  of the indigestible material. When fruit is taken for its laxative  effect and the irritation of the cellulose needs no consideration, the  skins of the fruits may be eaten instead of being rejected. However, to  avoid any trouble, they should be well chewed.    16. Minerals in Fruit.--All fruits contain a certain percentage of  mineral salts. The quantity varies in the different kinds of fruits, but  it averages about 1 per cent. These salts have the opposite effect on  the blood from those found in meats and cereals, but they act in much  the same way as the minerals of vegetables. In other words, they have a  tendency to render the blood more alkaline and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/994"],[0,"Riders to the Sea (#2)"],[1,"'s no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big  price for the finest white boards you'd find in Connemara.    [She looks round at the boards.]    BARTLEY How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for  nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and  south?    MAURYA If it wasn't found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and  there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it  was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the  price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?    BARTLEY [Working at the halter, to Cathleen.]    Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren't jumping in on the  rye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if  there is a good price going.    MAURYA How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?    BARTLEY [To Cathleen]    If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora  get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It's hard set we'll be  from this day with no one in it but one man to work.    MAURYA It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're drownd'd with the  rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman  looking for the grave?    [Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a  newer one of the same flannel.]    BARTLEY [To Nora.]    Is she coming to the pier?    NORA [Looking out.] She's passing the green head and letting fall her  sails.    BARTLEY [Getting his purse and tobacco.]    I'll have half an hour to go down, and you'll see me coming again in two  days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.    MAURYA [Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head.]    Isn't it a hard and cruel man won't hear a word from an old woman, and  she holding him from the sea?    CATHLEEN It's the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who  would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?    BARTLEY [Taking the halter.]    I must go now quickly. I'll ride down on the red mare, and the gray  pony'll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.    [He goes out.]    MAURYA [Crying out as he is in the door.]    He's gone now, God spare us, and we'll not see him again. He's gone  now, and when the black night is falling I'll have no son left me in the  world.    CATHLEEN Why wouldn't you give him your blessing and he looking round in  the door? Isn't it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without  your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in  his ear?    [Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without  looking round.]    NORA [Turning towards her.]    You're taking away the turf from the cake.    CATHLEEN [Crying out.]    The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we're after forgetting his bit of  bread.    [She comes over to the fire.]    NORA And it's destroyed he'll be going till dark night, and he after  eating nothing since the sun went up.    CATHLEEN [Turning the cake out of the oven.]    It's destroyed he'll be, surely. There's no sense left on any person in  a house where an old woman will be talking for ever.    [Maurya sways herself on her stool.]    CATHLEEN [Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to  Maurya.]    Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing.  You'll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say  \"God speed you,\" the way he'll be easy in his mind.    MAURYA [Taking the bread.]    Will I be in it as soon as himself?    CATHLEEN If you go now quickly.    MAURYA [Standing up unsteadily.]    It's hard set I am to walk.    CATHLEEN [Looking at her anxiously.]    Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she'll slip on the big stones.    NORA What stick?    CATHLEEN The stick Michael brought from Connemara.    MAURYA [Taking a stick Nora gives her.]    In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for  their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be  leaving things behind for them that do be old.    [She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder.]    CATHLEEN Wait, Nora, maybe she'd turn back quickly. She's that sorry,  God help her, you wouldn't know the thing she'd do.    NORA Is she gone round by the bush?    CATHLEEN [Looking out.]    She's gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she'll be  out of it again.    NORA [Getting the bundle from the loft.]    The young priest said he'd be passing to-morrow, and we might go down  and speak to him below if it's Michael's they are surely.    CATHLEEN [Taking the bundle.]    Did he say what way they were found?    NORA [Coming down.]    \"There were two men,\" says he, \"and they rowing round with poteen before  the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they  passing the black cliffs of the north.\"    CATHLEEN [Trying to open the bundle.]    Give me a knife, Nora, the string's perished with the salt water, and  there's a black knot on it you wouldn't loosen in a week.    NORA [Giving her a knife.]    I've heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.    CATHLEEN [Cutting the string.]    It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago--the man sold us that  knife--and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it  would be seven days you'd be in Donegal.    NORA And what time would a man take, and he floating?    [Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look  at them eagerly.]    CATHLEEN [In a low voice.]    The Lord spare us, Nora! isn't it a queer hard thing to say if it's his  they are surely?    NORA I'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel  on the other [she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner.]  It's not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?    CATHLEEN I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own  shirt was heavy with the salt in it [pointing to the corner]. There's a  bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.    [Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel.]    CATHLEEN It's the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren't there  great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn't it many another man  may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?    NORA [Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying  out.]    It's Michael, Cathleen, it's Michael; God spare his soul, and what will  herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?    CATHLEEN [Taking the stocking.]    It's a plain stocking.    NORA It's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three  score stitches, and I dropped four of them.    CATHLEEN [Counts the stitches.]    It's that number is in it [crying out.] Ah, Nora, isn't it a bitter  thing to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to  keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?    NORA [Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes.]    And isn't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who  was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain  stocking?    CATHLEEN [After an instant.]    Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.    NORA [Looking out.]    She is, Cathleen. She's coming up to the door.    CATHLEEN Put these things away before she'll come in. Maybe it's easier  she'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won't let on  we've heard anything the time he's on the sea.    NORA [Helping Cathleen to close the bundle.]    We'll put them here in the corner.    [They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to  the spinning-wheel.]    NORA Will she see it was crying I was?    CATHLEEN Keep your back to the door the way the light'll not be on you.    [Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door. Maurya  comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes over to her  stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still  in her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora points to the bundle  of bread.]    CATHLEEN [After spinning for a moment.]    You didn't give him his bit of bread?    [Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round.]    CATHLEEN Did you see him riding down?    [Maurya goes on keening.]    CATHLEEN [A little impatiently.]    God forgive you; isn't it a better thing to raise your voice and tell  what you seen, than to be making lamentation for a thing that's done?  Did you see Bartley, I'm saying to you?    MAURYA [With a weak voice.]    My heart's broken from this day.    CATHLEEN [As before.]    Did you see Bartley?    MAURYA I seen the fearfulest thing.    CATHLEEN [Leaves her wheel and looks out.]    God forgive you; he's riding the mare now over the green head, and the  gray pony behind him.    MAURYA [Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her  white tossed hair. With a frightened voice.]    The gray pony behind him.    CATHLEEN [Coming to the fire.]    What is it ails you, at all?    MAURYA [Speaking very slowly.]    I've seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen, since the day Bride  Dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms.    CATHLEEN AND NORA UAH.    [They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire.]    NORA Tell us what it is you seen.    MAURYA I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer  to myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with  the gray pony behind him [she puts up her hands, as if to hide something  from her eyes.] The Son of God spare us, Nora!    CATHLEEN What is it you seen.    MAURYA I seen Michael himself.    CATHLEEN [Speaking softly.]    You did not, mother; it wasn't Michael you seen, for his body is after  being found in the far north, and he's got a clean burial by the grace  of God.
