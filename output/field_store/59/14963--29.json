The heavy persecutions inflicted upon Bohemia had a disastrous effect upon  her intellectual life and national development which were completely  paralysed until the end of the eighteenth century, when owing to the  humanitarian ideals of those times, and as a reaction against the  Germanising centralistic efforts of Joseph II., the Czechs again began to  recover their national consciousness. This revival marked the beginning of  the Czecho-Slovak struggle for the re-establishment of their independence.  The movement was at first literary, and only in the forties became  political. It was a continuous struggle against reaction and absolutism,  and if the Czecho-Slovaks to-day can boast of an advanced civilisation, it  is only owing to their perseverance and hard endeavours, and not because of  any good-will on the part of the Austrian Government which put every  possible obstacle in their way.    2. _The present Austria-Hungary_ is primarily a dynastic estate, for the  crown was always its supreme political driving force, although at present  the Habsburgs are mere slaves of their masters, the Hohenzollerns. It is  this characteristic which justifies us in concluding that Austria is an  autocratic state _par excellence_. If there were no other reason, this  should be sufficient to make every true democrat an enemy of Austria.  Furthermore, it is this characteristic which makes us comprehend why the  Habsburg monarchy is fighting side by side with German autocracy and  imperialism against the allied democracies of the world.    Notwithstanding the so-called constitution which is a mere cloak for  absolutism, the monarch in Austria is emperor by \"Divine Right\" alone, and  is the absolute master of his subject peoples in virtue of his privileged  position which confers on him an inexhaustible amount of power and  influence. The internal as well as the foreign policy of the monarchy is  directed in the real or supposed interests of the dynasty. The principle  _divide et impera_ is its leading idea in internal politics, and the  increase of dynastic power in foreign policy. The question of war and peace  is decided by the emperor, to whom it also appertains to order matters  concerning the management, leadership and organisation of the whole army.  And though in Hungary the power of the monarch largely depends on the  Budapest Parliament, yet even here the constitutional power of the dynasty  is enormous, the King of Hungary being a governing and legislative factor  by no means inferior to that of the parliament.    Even when attempts were made at enfranchising the masses (as in 1896 and  finally in 1905), the motive again was purely dynastic. Such constitutional  measures as were taken, only strengthened racial dissensions and were  equally insincere and inefficient. The present constitution of 1867, as  well as the previous constitutions of 1849, 1860 and 1861, was granted by  the crown, to whom it was reserved to reverse or modify the same. The  parliament is absolutely powerless in Austria. It is a mere cloak for  absolutism, since the famous Paragraph 14 provides for absolutist  government by means of imperial decrees without parliament in case of  emergency. The dynasty took ample advantage of this clause during the first  three years of this war when absolutism and terrorism reigned supreme in  the Dual Monarchy. While since 1861 up to the beginning of the war 156  imperial decrees had been issued, fully 161 have been passed during the  first three years of the present war.    The arbitrary power of the dynasty is based: upon the organisation of the  army, the leadership of which is entrusted to the Germans; upon the feudal  aristocracy who are the only real Austrians, since they have no  nationality, though they invariably side with the dominant Germans and  Magyars; upon the power of the police who form the chief instrument of the  autocratic government and who spy upon and terrorise the population; upon  the German bureaucrats who do not consider themselves the servants of the  public, but look upon the public as their servant, and whose spirit of  meanness and corruption is so characteristic of the Austrian body politic;  finally, the dynasty relies upon the Catholic hierarchy who hold vast  landed property in Austria and regard it as the bulwark of Catholicism, and  who through Clericalism strive for political power rather than for the  religious welfare of their denomination. In alliance with them are the  powerful Jewish financiers who also control the press in Vienna and  Budapest. Clearly Austria is the very negation of democracy. It stands for  reaction, autocracy, falsehood and hypocrisy, and it is therefore no  exaggeration to say that nobody professing democratic views can reasonably  plead for the preservation of this system of political violence.    When we remember the enormous power of the dynasty and the political system  which supports it, we understand why in the past Austria has always played  the part of the most reactionary, autocratic and tyrannic state in Europe.  Hopes have indeed been expressed by some Austrophils in the good-will of  the new Austrian Emperor on account of his amiable character. The Slavs  have ample reason to distrust the Habsburgs who have proved to be  treacherous autocrats in the past, and whose records show them as an  incapable and degenerate family. As a political power Kaiser Karl is the  same menace to his subject Slavs as his predecessors. Above all, however,  he is of necessity a blind tool in the hands of Germany, and he cannot  possibly extricate himself from her firm grip. The Habsburgs have had their  chance, but they missed it. By systematic and continuous misgovernment they  created a gulf between the Slavs and themselves which nothing on earth can  remove. Every Habsburg believes he has a \"mission\" to fulfil. The only  mission left for Kaiser Karl is to abdicate and dissolve his empire into  its component parts. There is no reason whatever why Austria should be  saved for the sake of the degenerate and autocratic Habsburg dynasty.    3. Let us now examine the much misunderstood racial problems of the Dual  Monarchy. There is no Austrian nation, since there is no Austrian language.  Austria is a mere geographical expression. In fact the Slavs, constituting  the majority of Austrian subjects, would think it an insult to be called  Austrians. During the war they have been treated as subjects of an enemy  state, and to-day they have no part or lot with Austria. The Czech  statesman Rieger once declared that when the Slavs no longer desired the  existence of Austria, no one would be able to save her. And indeed, the  claims raised by the majority of Austria's population to-day mean the death  warrant of the Dual Monarchy.    To get a clear idea of the racial issue, we will quote the official  Austrian statistics, which tell us that in Austria-Hungary there are:               AUSTRIA.      HUNGARY.      BOSNIA.      TOTAL.  SLAVS:     Million.     Million.      Million.  Million.  Million.    Czecho-Slovaks 6.4         2            --       8.4  Yugoslavs      2           3            1.8      6.8  Poles          5           --           --       5  Ruthenes       3.5         0.5          --       4                                                   --           24.2  LATINS:  Italians       0.8         --           --       0.8  Rumanians      0.3         2.9          --       3.2                                                   --            4  GERMANS       10           2            --                    12  MAGYARS       --          10            --                    10  OTHERS         0.6         0.4          --                     1                  28.6        20.8         1.8                   51.2    Thus it appears that the Slavs alone (without Italians and Rumanians) form  about 48 per cent. of the total population. The Germans form only 24 per  cent. of the population of Austria-Hungary, while in Hungary proper the  dominant Magyars do not form quite 50 per cent. of the population. The  predominance of the German and Magyar minorities is apparent not only from  the fact that they hold the reins of government, but also from their unfair  proportional representation in both parliaments. Thus instead of 310 seats  out of 516 in the Reichsrat the Slavs hold only 259, while the Germans hold  232 instead of 160. By gaining 83 Polish votes in return for temporary  concessions, the Germans have thus always been in the majority in the  Reichsrat in the past. In Hungary the proportion is still more unjust. The  Magyars hold 405 seats instead of 210 in the parliament of Budapest out of  the total number of 413, while the non-Magyars, entitled according to their  numbers to 203 seats, have in reality only five representatives in the  \"democratic\" parliament of Budapest.    All the above calculations are based upon official statistics which are  grossly exaggerated in favour of the Germans and Magyars. The picture would  be still more appalling if we took into consideration the actual number of  the Slavs. The Austrian census is not based upon the declaration of  nationality or of the native language, but upon the statement of the  \"language of communication\" (\"Umgangsprache\"). In mixed districts economic  pressure is brought against the Slavs, who are often workmen dependent upon  German masters and bound to declare their nationality as German for fear  they should lose their employment. From private statistics it has been  found that the percentage of Germans in Bohemia can hardly exceed 20 per  cent, as against 37 per cent, given by the official census. Still greater  pressure is brought to bear against the Slavs by the Magyars in Hungary,  who are famous for the brutal methods in which they indulge for the purpose  of shameless falsification of their official statistics. Thus the actual  strength of the rival races of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#2)"],[1,"us. An artist must be  better qualified to succeed in this undertaking, who, besides a delicate  taste and a quick apprehension, possesses an accurate knowledge of the  internal fabric, the operations of the understanding, the workings of  the passions, and the various species of sentiment which discriminate  vice and virtue. How painful soever this inward search or enquiry may  appear, it becomes, in some measure, requisite to those, who would  describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and  manners. The anatomist presents to the eye the most hideous and  disagreeable objects; but his science is useful to the painter in  delineating even a Venus or an Helen. While the latter employs all the  richest colours of his art, and gives his figures the most graceful and  engaging airs; he must still carry his attention to the inward structure  of the human body, the position of the muscles, the fabric of the bones,  and the use and figure of every part or organ. Accuracy is, in every  case, advantageous to beauty, and just reasoning to delicate sentiment.  In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other.    Besides, we may observe, in every art or profession, even those which  most concern life or action, that a spirit of accuracy, however  acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection, and renders them  more subservient to the interests of society. And though a philosopher  may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully  cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the  whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and  calling. The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility, in  the subdividing and balancing of power; the lawyer more method and finer  principles in his reasonings; and the general more regularity in his  discipline, and more caution in his plans and operations. The stability  of modern governments above the ancient, and the accuracy of modern  philosophy, have improved, and probably will still improve, by similar  gradations.    6. Were there no advantage to be reaped from these studies, beyond the  gratification of an innocent curiosity, yet ought not even this to be  despised; as being one accession to those few safe and harmless  pleasures, which are bestowed on human race. The sweetest and most  inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and  learning; and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way, or  open up any new prospect, ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to  mankind. And though these researches may appear painful and fatiguing,  it is with some minds as with some bodies, which being endowed with  vigorous and florid health, require severe exercise, and reap a pleasure  from what, to the generality of mankind, may seem burdensome and  laborious. Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind as well as to the  eye; but to bring light from obscurity, by whatever labour, must needs  be delightful and rejoicing.    But this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy, is objected  to, not only as painful and fatiguing, but as the inevitable source of  uncertainty and error. Here indeed lies the justest and most plausible  objection against a considerable part of metaphysics, that they are not  properly a science; but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human  vanity, which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the  understanding, or from the craft of popular superstitions, which, being  unable to defend themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling  brambles to cover and protect their weakness. Chaced from the open  country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie in wait to break in  upon every unguarded avenue of the mind, and overwhelm it with religious  fears and prejudices. The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch a  moment, is oppressed. And many, through cowardice and folly, open the  gates to the enemies, and willingly receive them with reverence and  submission, as their legal sovereigns.    7. But is this a sufficient reason, why philosophers should desist from  such researches, and leave superstition still in possession of her  retreat? Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion, and perceive  the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the  enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from frequent disappointment, will  at last abandon such airy sciences, and discover the proper province of  human reason. For, besides, that many persons find too sensible an  interest in perpetually recalling such topics; besides this, I say, the  motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences;  since, however unsuccessful former attempts may have proved, there is  still room to hope, that the industry, good fortune, or improved  sagacity of succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to  former ages. Each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous  prize, and find himself stimulated, rather that discouraged, by the  failures of his predecessors; while he hopes that the glory of achieving  so hard an adventure is reserved for him alone. The only method of  freeing learning, at once, from these abstruse questions, is to enquire  seriously into the nature of human understanding, and show, from an  exact analysis of its powers and capacity, that it is by no means fitted  for such remote and abstruse subjects. We must submit to this fatigue,  in order to live at ease ever after: And must cultivate true metaphysics  with some care, in order to destroy the false and adulterate. Indolence,  which, to some persons, affords a safeguard against this deceitful  philosophy, is, with others, overbalanced by curiosity; and despair,  which, at some moments, prevails, may give place afterwards to sanguine  hopes and expectations. Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic  remedy, fitted for all persons and all dispositions; and is alone able  to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which,  being mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a manner  impenetrable to careless reasoners, and gives it the air of science  and wisdom.    8. Besides this advantage of rejecting, after deliberate enquiry, the  most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning, there are many  positive advantages, which result from an accurate scrutiny into the  powers and faculties of human nature. It is remarkable concerning the  operations of the mind, that, though most intimately present to us, yet,  whenever they become the object of reflexion, they seem involved in  obscurity; nor can the eye readily find those lines and boundaries,  which discriminate and distinguish them. The objects are too fine to  remain long in the same aspect or situation; and must be apprehended in  an instant, by a superior penetration, derived from nature, and improved  by habit and reflexion. It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of  science barely to know the different operations of the mind, to separate  them from each other, to class them under their proper heads, and to  correct all that seeming disorder, in which they lie involved, when made  the object of reflexion and enquiry. This talk of ordering and  distinguishing, which has no merit, when performed with regard to  external bodies, the objects of our senses, rises in its value, when  directed towards the operations of the mind, in proportion to the  difficulty and labour, which we meet with in performing it. And if we  can go no farther than this mental geography, or delineation of the  distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satisfaction to  go so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no  means obvious) the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be  esteemed, in all pretenders to learning and philosophy.    Nor can there remain any suspicion, that this science is uncertain and  chimerical; unless we should entertain such a scepticism as is entirely  subversive of all speculation, and even action. It cannot be doubted,  that the mind is endowed with several powers and faculties, that these  powers are distinct from each other, that what is really distinct to the  immediate perception may be distinguished by reflexion; and  consequently, that there is a truth and falsehood in all propositions on  this subject, and a truth and falsehood, which lie not beyond the  compass of human understanding. There are many obvious distinctions of  this kind, such as those between the will and understanding, the  imagination and passions, which fall within the comprehension of every  human creature; and the finer and more philosophical distinctions are no  less real and certain, though more difficult to be comprehended. Some  instances, especially late ones, of success in these enquiries, may give  us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch of  learning. And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to  give us a true system of the planets, and adjust the position and order  of those remote bodies; while we affect to overlook those, who, with so  much success, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we are so  intimately concerned?    9. But may we not hope, that philosophy, if cultivated with care, and  encouraged by the attention of the public, may carry its researches  still farther, and discover, at least in some degree, the secret springs  and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations?  Astronomers had long contented themselves with proving, from the  phaenomena, the true motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly  bodies: Till a philosopher, at last, arose, who seems, from the happiest  reasoning, to have also determined the laws and forces, by which the  revolutions of the planets are governed and directed. The like has been  performed with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no reason  to despair"]]]
