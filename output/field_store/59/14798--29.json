JOURNEYS IN DIVERSE PLACES    [Footnote: The present translation is taken from Mr. Stephen  Paget's \"Ambroise Pare and His Times\" by arrangement with Messrs.  G. P. Putnam's Sons.]      1537-1569    THE JOURNEY TO TURIN. 1537      I will here shew my readers the towns and places where I found a  way to learn the art of surgery: for the better instruction of  the young surgeon.    And first, in the year 1536, the great King Francis sent a large  army to Turin, to recover the towns and castles that had been  taken by the Marquis du Guast, Lieutenant-General of the Emperor.  M. the Constable, then Grand Master, was Lieutenant-General of  the army, and M. de Montejan was Colonel-General of the infantry,  whose surgeon I was at this time. A great part of the army being  come to the Pass of Suze, we found the enemy occupying it; and  they had made forts and trenches, so that we had to fight to  dislodge them and drive them out. And there were many killed and  wounded on both sides,--but the enemy were forced to give way and  retreat into the castle, which was captured, part of it, by  Captain Le Rat, who was posted on a little hill with some of his  soldiers, whence they fired straight on the enemy. He received an  arquebus-shot in his right ankle, and fell to the ground at once,  and then said, \"Now they have got the Rat.\" I dressed him, and  God healed him.    We entered pell-mell into the city, and passed over the dead  bodies, and some not yet dead, hearing them cry under our horses'  feet; and they made my heart ache to hear them. And truly I  repented I had left Paris to see such a pitiful spectacle. Being  come into the city, I entered into a stable, thinking to lodge my  own and my man's horse, and found four dead soldiers, and three  propped against the wall, their features all changed, and they  neither saw, heard, nor spake, and their clothes were still  smouldering where the gunpowder had burned them. As I was looking  at them with pity, there came an old soldier who asked me if  there were any way to cure them; I said no. And then he went up  to them and cut their throats, gently, and without ill will  toward them. Seeing this great cruelty, I told him he was a  villain: he answered he prayed God, when he should be in such a  plight, he might find someone to do the same for him; that he  should not linger in misery.    To come back to my story, the enemy were called on to surrender,  which they did, and left the city with only their lives saved,  and the white stick in their hands; and most of them went off to  the Chateau de Villane, where about two hundred Spaniards were  stationed. M. the Constable would not leave these behind him,  wishing to clear the road for our own men. The castle is seated  on a small hill; which gave great confidence to those within,  that we could not bring our artillery to bear upon them. They  were summoned to surrender, or they would be cut in pieces: they  answered that they would not, saying they were as good and  faithful servants of the Emperor, as M. the Constable could be of  the King his master. Thereupon our men by night hoisted up two  great cannons, with the help of the Swiss soldiers and the  lansquenets; but as ill luck would have it, when the cannons were  in position, a gunner stupidly set fire to a bag full of  gunpowder, whereby he was burned, with ten or twelve soldiers;  and the flame of the powder discovered our artillery, so that all  night long those within the castle fired their arquebuses at the  place where they had caught sight of the cannons, and many of our  men were killed and wounded. Next day, early in the morning, the  attack was begun, and we soon made a breach in their wall. Then  they demanded a parley; but it was too late, for meanwhile our  French infantry, seeing them taken by surprise, mounted the  breach, and cut them all in pieces, save one very fair young girl  of Piedmont, whom a great seigneur would have. ... The captain  and the ensign were taken alive, but soon afterward hanged and  strangled on the battlements of the gate of the city, to give  example and fear to the Emperor's soldiers, not to be so rash and  mad as to wish to hold such places against so great an army.    The soldiers within the castle, seeing our men come on them with  great fury, did all they could to defend themselves, and killed  and wounded many of our soldiers with pikes, arquebuses, and  stones, whereby the surgeons had all their work cut out for them.  Now I was at this time a fresh-water soldier; I had not yet seen  wounds made by gunshot at the first dressing. It is true I had  read in John de Vigo, first book, Of Wounds in General, eighth  chapter, that wounds made by firearms partake of venenosity, by  reason of the powder; and for their cure he bids you cauterise  them with oil of elders scalding hot, mixed with a little  treacle. And to make no mistake, before I would use the said oil,  knowing this was to bring great pain to the patient, I asked  first before I applied it, what the other surgeons did for the  first dressing; which was to put the said oil, boiling well, into  the wounds, with tents and setons; wherefore I took courage to do  as they did. At last my oil ran short, and I was forced instead  thereof to apply a digestive made of the yolks of eggs, oil of  roses, and turpentine. In the night I could not sleep in quiet,  fearing some default in not cauterising, that I should find the  wounded to whom I had not used the said oil dead from the poison  of their wounds; which made me rise very early to visit them,  where beyond my expectation I found that those to whom I had  applied my digestive medicament had but little pain, and their  wounds without inflammation or swelling, having rested fairly  well that night; the others, to whom the boiling oil was used, I  found feverish, with great pain and swelling about the edges of  their wounds. Then I resolved never more to burn thus cruelly  poor men with gunshot wounds.    While I was at Turin, I found a surgeon famed above all others  for his treatment of gunshot wounds; into whose favour I found  means to insinuate myself, to have the recipe of his balm, as he  called it, wherewith he dressed gunshot wounds. And he made me  pay my court to him for two years, before I could possibly draw  the recipe from him. In the end, thanks to my gifts and presents,  he gave it to me; which was to boil, in oil of lilies, young  whelps just born, and earth-worms prepared with Venetian  turpentine. Then I was joyful, and my heart made glad, that I had  understood his remedy, which was like that which I had obtained  by chance.    See how I learned to treat gunshot wounds; not by books.    My Lord Marshal Montejan remained Lieutenant-General for the King  in Piedmont, having ten or twelve thousand men in garrison in the  different cities and castles, who were often fighting among  themselves with swords and other weapons, even with arquebuses.  And if there were four wounded, I always had three of them; and  if there were question of cutting off an arm or a leg, or of  trepanning, or of reducing a fracture or a dislocation, I  accomplished it all. The Lord Marshal sent me now hire now there  to dress the soldiers committed to me who were wounded in other  cities beside Turin, so that I was always in the country, one way  or the other.    M. the Marshal sent to Milan, to a physician of no less  reputation than the late M. le Grand for his success in practice,  to treat him for an hepatic flux, whereof in the end he died.  This physician was some while at Turin to treat him, and was  often called to visit the wounded, where always he found me; and  I was used to consult with him, and with some other surgeons; and  when we had resolved to do any serious work of surgery, it was  Ambroise Pare that put his hand thereto, which I would do  promptly and skilfully, and with great assurance, insomuch that  the physician wondered at me, to be so ready in the operations of  surgery, and I so young. One day, discoursing with the Lord  Marshal, he said to him:    \"Signor, tu hai un Chirurgico giovane di anni, ma egli e vecchio  di sapere e di esperientia: Guardato bene, perche egli ti fara  servicio et honore.\" That is to say, \"Thou hast a surgeon young  in age, but he is old in knowledge and experience: take good  care, of him, for he will do thee service and honour.\" But the  good man did not know I had lived three years at the Hotel Dieu  in Paris, with the patients there.    In the end, M. the Marshal died of his hepatic flux. He being  dead, the King sent M. the Marshal d'Annebaut to be in his place:  who did me the honour to ask me to live with him, and he would  treat me as well or better than M. the Marshal de Montejan. Which  I would not do, for grief at the loss of my master, who loved me  dearly; so I returned to Paris.          THE JOURNEY TO MAROLLE AND LOW BRITTANY. 1543      I went to the Camp of Marolle, with the late M. de Rohan, as  surgeon of his company; where was the King himself. M.  d'Estampes, Governor of Brittany, had told the King how the  English had hoist sail to land in Low Brittany; and had prayed  him to send, to help him, MM. de Rohan and de Laval, because they  were the seigneurs of that country, and by their help the country  people would beat back the enemy, and keep them from landing.  Having heard this, the King sent these seigneurs to go in haste  to the help of their country; and to each was given as much power  as to the Governor, so that they were all three the King's  Lieutenants. They willingly took this charge upon them, and went  off posting with good speed, and took me with them as far as  Landreneau. There we found every one in arms, the tocsin sounding  on every side, for a good five or six leagues round the harbours,  Brent, Couquet, Crozon, le Fou, Doulac, Laudanec; each well  furnished with artillery, as cannons, demi-cannons, culverins,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#2)"],[1,"hauled  out by the river police shortly after midnight, at the lower end of  Limehouse Reach. He was alive then--they heard his cry--but he died  while they were hauling him into the boat.\"    \"Any statement?\" rapped Kerry.    \"He was past it, Chief Inspector. According to the report of the officer  in charge, he mumbled something which sounded like: 'It has bitten me,'  just before he became unconscious.\"    \"'It has bitten me,'\" murmured Kerry. \"The divisional surgeon has seen  him?\"    \"Yes, Chief Inspector. And in his opinion the man did not die from  drowning, but from some form of virulent poisoning.\"    \"Poisoning?\"    \"That's the idea. There will be a further examination, of course. Either  a hypodermic injection or a bite.\"    \"A bite?\" said Kerry. \"The bite of what?\"    \"That I cannot say, Chief Inspector. A venomous reptile, I suppose.\"    Kerry stared down critically at the swollen face of the victim, and then  glanced sharply aside at Durham.    \"Accounts for his appearance, I suppose,\" he murmured.    \"Yes,\" said Durham quietly. \"He hadn't been in the water long enough to  look like that.\" He turned to the local officer. \"Is there any theory as  to the point at which he went in?\"    \"Well, an arrest has been made.\"    \"By whom? of whom?\" rapped Kerry.    \"Two constables patrolling the Chinatown area arrested a man for  suspicious loitering. He turned out to be a well-known criminal--Jim  Poland, with a whole list of convictions against him. They're holding  him at Limehouse Station, and the theory is that he was operating  with------\" He nodded in the direction of the body.    \"Then who's the smart with the swollen face?\" inquired Kerry. \"He's a  new one on me.\"    \"Yes, but he's been identified by one of the K Division men. He is an  American crook with a clean slate, so far as this side is concerned.  Cohen is his name. And the idea seems to be that he went in at some  point between where he was found by the river police and the point at  which Jim Poland was arrested.\"    Kerry snapped his teeth together audibly, and:    \"I'm open to learn,\" he said, \"that the house of Huang Chow is within  that area.\"    \"It is.\"    \"I thought so. He died the same way the Chinaman died awhile ago,\"  snapped Kerry savagely.    \"It looks very queer.\" He glanced aside at the local officer. \"Cover him  up,\" he ordered, and, turning, he walked briskly out of the mortuary,  followed by Detective Durham.    Although dawn was not far off, this was the darkest hour of the night,  so that even the sounds of dockland were muted and the riverside slept  as deeply as the great port of London ever sleeps. Vague murmurings  there were and distant clankings, with the hum of machinery which is  never still.    Few of London's millions were awake at that hour, yet Scotland Yard  was awake in the person of the fierce-eyed Chief Inspector and his  subordinate. Perhaps those who lightly criticize the Metropolitan Force  might have learned a new respect for the tireless vigilance which keeps  London clean and wholesome, had they witnessed this scene on the borders  of Limehouse, as Kerry, stepping into a waiting taxi-cab accompanied by  Durham, proceeded to Limehouse Police Station in that still hour when  the City slept.    The arrival of Kerry created something of a stir amongst the officials  on duty. His reputation in these days was at least as great as that of  the most garrulous Labour member.    The prisoner was in cells, but the Chief Inspector elected to interview  him in the office; and accordingly, while the officer in charge sat at  an extremely tidy writing-table, tapping the blotting-pad with a pencil,  and Detective John Durham stood beside him, Kerry paced up and down the  little room, deep in reflection, until the door opened and the prisoner  was brought in.    One swift glance the Chief Inspector gave at the battle-scarred face,  and recognized instantly that this was a badly frightened man. Crossing  to the table he took up a typewritten slip which lay there, and:    \"Your name is James Poland?\" he said. \"Four convictions; one, robbery  with violence.\"    Jim Poland nodded sullenly.    \"You were arrested at the corner of Pekin Street about midnight. What  were you doing there?\"    \"Taking a walk.\"    \"I'll say it again,\" rapped Kerry, fixing his fierce eyes upon the man's  face. \"What were you doing there?\"    \"I've told you.\"    \"And I tell you you're a liar. Where did you leave the man Cohen?\"    Poland blinked his small eyes, cleared his throat, and looked down at  the floor uneasily. Then:    \"Who's Cohen?\" he grunted.    \"You mean, who was Cohen?\" cried Kerry.    The shot went home. The man clenched his fists and looked about the room  from face to face.    \"You don't tell me------\" he began huskily.    \"I've told you,\" said Kerry. \"He's on the slab. Spit out the truth;  it'll be good for your health.\"    The man hesitated, then looked up, his eyes half closed and a cunning  expression upon his face.    \"Make out your own case,\" he said. \"You've got nothing against me.\"    Kerry snapped his teeth together viciously.    \"I've told you what happened to your pal,\" he warned. \"If you're a wise  man you'll come in on our side, before the same thing happens to you.\"    \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" growled Poland.    Kerry nodded to the constable at the doorway.    \"Take him back,\" he ordered.    Jim Poland being returned to his cell, Kerry, as the door closed behind  the prisoner and his guard, stared across at Durham where he stood  beside the table.    \"An old hand,\" he said. \"But there's another way.\" He glanced at the  officer in charge. \"Hold him till the morning. He'll prove useful.\"    From his waistcoat pocket he took out a slip of chewing gum, unwrapped  it, and placed the mint-flavoured wafer between his large white teeth.  He bit upon it savagely, settled his hat upon his head, and, turning,  walked toward the door. In the doorway he paused.    \"Come with me, Durham,\" he said. \"I am leaving the conduct of the case  entirely in your hands from now onward.\"    Detective Durham looked surprised and not a little anxious.    \"I am doing so for two reasons,\" continued the Chief Inspector. \"These  two reasons I shall now explain.\"          III    THE SECRET TREASURE-HOUSE        Unlike its sister colony in New York, there are no show places in  Limehouse. The visitor sees nothing but mean streets and dark doorways.  The superficial inquirer comes away convinced that the romance of the  Asiatic district has no existence outside the imaginations of writers  of fiction. Yet here lies a secret quarter, as secret and as strange,  in its smaller way, as its parent in China which is called the Purple  Forbidden City.    On a morning when mist lay over the Thames reaches, softening the  harshness of the dock buildings and lending an air of mystery to the  vessels stealing out upon the tide, a man walked briskly along Limehouse  Causeway, looking about him inquiringly, as one unfamiliar with the  neighbourhood. Presently he seemed to recognize a turning to the right,  and he pursued this for a time, now walking more slowly.    A European woman, holding a half-caste baby in her arms, stood in an  open doorway, watching him uninterestedly. Otherwise, except for one  neatly dressed young Chinaman, who passed him about halfway along the  street, there was nothing which could have told the visitor that he  had crossed the borderline dividing West from East and was now in an  Oriental town.    A very narrow alleyway between two dingy houses proved to be the spot  for which he was looking; and, having stared about him for a while, he  entered this alleyway. At the farther end it was crossed T-fashion, by  another alley, the only object of interest being an iron post at the  crossing, and the scenery being made up entirely of hideous brick walls.    About halfway along on the left, set in one of these walls, were strong  wooden gates, apparently those of a warehouse. Beside them was a door  approached by two very dirty steps. There was a bell-push near the door,  but upon neither of these entrances was there any plate to indicate the  name of the proprietor of the establishment.    From his pocket-book the visitor extracted a card, consulted something  written upon it, and then pressed the bell.    It was very quiet in this dingy little court. No sound of the busy  thoroughfares penetrated here; and although the passage forming the  top of the \"T\" practically marked the river bank, only dimly could one  discern the sounds which belong to a seaport.    Presently the door was opened by a Chinese boy who wore the ordinary  native working dress, and who regarded the man upon the step with  oblique, tired-looking eyes.    \"Mr. Huang Chow?\" asked the caller.    The boy nodded.    \"You wantchee him see?\"    \"If he is at home.\"    The boy glanced at the card, which the visitor still held between finger  and thumb, and extended his hand silently. The card was surrendered. It  was that of an antique dealer of Dover Street, Piccadilly, and written  upon the back was the following: \"Mr. Hampden would like to do business  with you.\" The signature of the dealer followed.    The boy turned and passed along a dim and perfectly unfurnished passage  which the opening of the door had revealed, while Mr. Hampden stood upon  the step and lighted a cigarette.    In less than a minute the boy returned and beckoned to him to come in.  As he did so, and the door was closed, he almost stumbled, so dark was  the passage.    Presently, guided by the boy, he found himself in a very business-like  little office, where a girl sat at an American desk, looking up at him  inquiringly.    She was of a dark and arresting type. Without being pretty in the  European sense, there was something appealing in her fine, dark eyes,  and she possessed the inviting smile which is the heritage of Eastern  women. Her dress was not unlike that of any"]]]
