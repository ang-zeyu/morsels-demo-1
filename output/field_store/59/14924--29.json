Stoddard, Lieuts. Milford & Worrell together with Messrs. A. Chouteau,  C. Gratiot, and many other respectable inhabitants of St. Louis, who  had engaged to accompany me to the Vilage of St. Charles; accordingly  at 12 Oclk after bidding an affectionate adieu to my Hostis, that  excellent woman the spouse of Mr. Peter Chouteau, and some of my fair  friends of St. Louis, we set forward to that village in order to join  my friend companion and fellow labourer Capt. William Clark who had  previously arrived at that place with the party destined for the  discovery of the interior of the continent of North America the first 5  miles of our rout laid through a beatifull high leavel and fertile  prarie which incircles the town of St. Louis from N. W. to S. E. the  lands through which we then passed are somewhat broken up fertile the  plains and woodlands are here indiscriminately interspersed untill you  arrive within three miles of the vilage when the woodland commences and  continues to the Missouri the latter is extreamly fertile. At half  after one P.M. our progress was interrupted the near approach of a  violent thunder storm from the N. W. and concluded to take shelter in a  little cabbin hard by untill the rain should be over; accordingly we  alighted and remained about an hour and a half and regailed ourselves  with a could collation which we had taken the precaution to bring with  us from St. Louis.    The clouds continued to follow each other in rapaid succession,  insomuch that there was but little prospect of it's ceasing to rain  this evening; as I had determined to reach St. Charles this evening and  knowing that there was now no time to be lost I set forward in the  rain, most of the gentlemen continued with me, we arrived at half after  six and joined Capt Clark, found the party in good health and sperits.  suped this evening with Monsr. Charles Tayong a Spanish Ensign & late  Commandant of St. Charles at an early hour I retired to rest on board  the barge--St. Charles is situated on the North bank of the Missouri 21  Miles above it's junction with the Mississippi, and about the same  distance N. W. from St. Louis; it is bisected by one principal street  about a mile in length runing nearly parrallel with the river, the  plain on which it stands-is narrow tho sufficiently elivated to secure  it against the annual inundations of the river, which usually happen in  the month of June, and in the rear it is terminated by a range of small  hills, hence the appellation of petit Cote, a name by which this vilage  is better known to the French inhabitants of the Illinois than that of  St. Charles. The Vilage contains a Chappel, one hundred dwelling  houses, and about 450 inhabitants; their houses are generally small and  but illy constructed; a great majority of the inhabitants are miserably  pour, illiterate and when at home excessively lazy, tho they are polite  hospitable and by no means deficient in point of natural genious, they  live in a perfect state of harmony among each other; and plase as  implicit confidence in the doctrines of their speritual pastor, the  Roman Catholic priest, as they yeald passive obedience to the will of  their temporal master the commandant. a small garden of vegetables is  the usual extent of their cultivation, and this is commonly imposed on  the old men and boys; the men in the vigor of life consider the  cultivation of the earth a degrading occupation, and in order to gain  the necessary subsistence for themselves and families, either undertake  hunting voyages on their own account, or engage themselves as hirelings  to such persons as possess sufficient capital to extend their traffic  to the natives of the interior parts of the country; on those voyages  in either case, they are frequently absent from their families or homes  the term of six twelve or eighteen months and alwas subjected to severe  and incessant labour, exposed to the ferosity of the lawless savages,  the vicissitudes of weather and climate, and dependant on chance or  accident alone for food, raiment or relief in the event of malady.  These people are principally the decendants of the Canadian French, and  it is not an inconsiderable proportian of them that can boast a small  dash of the pure blood of the aboriginees of America. On consulting  with my friend Capt. C. I found it necessary that we should pospone our  departure untill 2 P M. the next day and accordingly gave orders to the  party to hold themselves in readiness to depart at that hour.    Captn. Clark now informed me that having gotten all the stores on board  the Barge and perogues on the evening of the 13th of May he determined  to leave our winter cantainment at the mouth of River Dubois the next  day, and to ascend the Missouri as far as the Vilage of St. Charles,  where as it had been previously concerted between us, he was to wait my  arrival; this movement while it advanced us a small distance on our  rout, would also enable him to determine whether the vessels had been  judiciously loaded and if not timely to make the necessary alterations;  accordingly at 4 P.M. on Monday the 14th of May 1804, he embarked with  the party in the presence of a number of the neighbouring Citizens who  had assembled to witness his departure. during the fore part of this  day it rained excessively hard. In my last letter to the President  dated at St. Louis I mentioned the departure of Capt. Clark from River  Dubois on the 15th Inst, which was the day that had been calculated on,  but having completed the arrangements a day earlyer he departed on the  14th as before mentioned. On the evening of the 14th the party halted  and encamped on the upper point of the first Island which lyes near the  Larbord shore, on the same side and nearly opposite the center of this  Island a small Creek disimbogues called Couldwater.    The course and distance of this day was West 4 Miles the Wind from N. E.

Col. John Horan,  Post Commander of Camp John Hay, waiting for instructions. I was a  captain and a doctor, the C.O. of the thirty five bed station  hospital.    Saluting the colonel, I was told to sit down and wait for further  instructions. It was dark and cold. Maps and orders were on the  colonel's dimly lighted desk. Other officers were beginning to arrive.    Don Bell's voice blared forth from Radio KZRH in Manila: \"Those dirty  little bastards have struck Pearl Harbor! Reports remain sketchy, but  there is no doubt! \"Oh God!\" Bell was actually crying, near hysteria,  as he continued: \"The yellow-bellied Japs have hit our ships at  anchor!\"    Everyone was extremely excited; the air was becoming blue with  cigarette smoke. No one was talking; we were all intently  listening-for any late news. Several junior officers were openly  nipping on pocket flasks. I thought to myself, \"This is one time when  I'm going to need all my marbles.\" We had recently returned two junior  officers for alcoholism; they couldn't cope with the tropics even in  peacetime. Or did they outsmart me and get back to the States to sit  out the war?    No news was coming in; we were all anxious to get back to our units to  make necessary preparations for war, but had to await instructions.  For months we had anticipated war with Japan. We were the nearest U.S.  base to Japan, so were very sensitive to any war-like talk or  gestures. Actually, the thoughts of war hadn't bothered me too much; a  farmer had once told me, \"If you are going to get kicked by a mule, it  is best to be close to the mule!\" Over the last forty years, we knew  the Japanese had been preparing for war, taking scrap iron and raw  materials from the Philippines to Japan. Now, we had a strange feeling  that we might be getting some of these materials back in a more  sophisticated form.    We had no idea how, when or where this war would begin in the  Philippines. The last place we expected it would happen was Camp John  Hay, a Rest and Recreation Center (R.&R.), offering a delightful  climate for military and naval personnel and their dependents on duty  in the Far East, desiring temporary relief from the intense heat and  humidity of the lowlands.    Camp John Hay was pleasantly located one mile above sea level amongst  the pine trees of Mountain Province in Baguio, the summer capital of  the Philippines. It was only twenty miles from the beautiful white  sand beaches, the stately palms and the sweltering sun of Lingayen  Gulf. Camp Hay actually had no real military value. It had been set    aside in 1903 as a recreation area by President Theodore Roosevelt,  and named after his Secretary of State, John Milton Hay. The same year  Roosevelt designated Baguio as the summer capital of the Philippines.    In December, 1941, there were only two companies of the 43rd Infantry  of Philippine Scouts (P.S.), a housekeeping detachment, stationed  there. The camp had no fortifications and no large weapons, only a few  wooden barracks and some one hundred or so obsolete rifles of W. W. I.  vintage. There was one small salute cannon for raising and lowering  \"Old Glory.\"    Looking back several months to July, 1941, when General MacArthur was  appointed Commanding General of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Far East  (USAFFE), he recruited 110,000 young Filipinos for the Philippine Army  (P.A.). It would be many months before they could be trained as they  spoke some sixty dialects. They looked more like boy scouts than  soldiers with their fiber helmets, sport shirts and tennis shoes.    About the same time, War Plan Rainbow 5 was adopted by Roosevelt's  Joint Army-Navy Board: first the Allies would conquer Germany and  Italy. As for Japan, the Allied strategy in the Far East was purely  defensive. MacArthur opposed the idea of the Philippines being  abandoned, but agreed with the plan \"to defend all Philippine soil.\"  He told his officers: \"The beaches must be defended at all costs;  prevent the enemy from making any landing!\"    We at Camp John Hay believed ourselves reasonably safe in this  mountain resort, even when war seemed imminent. President Manuel  Quezon also must have considered himself secure in Camp Hay as he was  in residence at the beautiful presidential mansion.    Finally, Colonel Horan, standing tall behind his desk, announced: \"I  have been unable to obtain any new information from USAFFE in Manila.  I understand the damage done to the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor has  been extensive. Captain Warner (CO. of Military Police (M.P.): take  your M.P.s and any scouts that you need, round up all Japanese  civilians in the Baguio area, and bring them into camp!       \"Lieutenant Velasco: build an eight-foot fence around Barracks    8 and 9; confine all Japanese internees there!       \"Other officers: acquaint your troops with the present war  situation, and War Plan Rainbow 5. Stay near your telephones!\"       At 0730 hours, with a lump in my throat and a complete loss    of appetite, I tried to swallow a few bites of breakfast at the  Officers' Mess, overlooking the gorgeous valleys below. Everyone was  excited, wondering what the next news would be. Normally I would have  walked the few blocks from the hospital to the mess hall and back,  just for the exercise; this morning I drove my1936 Model A coupe. Time  might become very important at any moment.       At 0800 hours I was in my office in the hospital, on a hill  overlooking Camp Hay, carefully studying my orders and maps.    At 0805 hours our two Army nurses, Captain Ruby Bradley and Lieutenant  Beatrice Chambers, entered my office. I inquired, \"Do you know that we  are at war with Japan?\"    Before either could answer, bombs were falling on all sides of the  hospital. \"There they are!\" I exclaimed. Not yet realizing how  dangerous the bombs could be, we casually walked to the windows and  watched the tremendous explosions moving across the camp-toward  headquarters-raising clouds of dust to the rooftops. The war arrived  at Camp John Hay at 0809 hours, Dec. 8, 1941. Between twenty and  twenty-five twin-engine bombers were overhead in a diamond formation.  Soon some 150 bombs of various sizes were bringing disability and  death to many of our soldiers-drilling on the parade ground-and to  their families in their small homes. It seemed unreal that Camp Hay  could be the first target of the Japanese bombers, actually starting  World War II in the Philippines.    Where were our American planes? We probably did just what the Japanese  planned that we would. We called Clark Air Field-about one-hundred  miles to the southwest, and told them, \"Camp John Hay is being bombed!  Get some fighters up here, and keep those bombers away!\"    We had no air-raid sirens, no machine guns, no anti-aircraft guns,  nothing to deter them. We were surprised by the air attack, and even  more by their accuracy. We heard the bombers were led by German  pilots-possibly the very ones we were playing golf with the previous  week.    If the Japanese thought that they would catch our military and naval  officers on weekend leave at Camp Hay, they were fooled, as all  personnel had previously been restricted to their stations and ships  by a General Alert. Within thirty minutes, the U.S. fighters were  circling overhead looking for Jap planes. Finding none, they returned  to Clark Field just before noon to    gas up and get lunch. Along with thirty-five U.S. bombers, the  fighters lined up on the runways, soon to be blasted by two waves of  50 heavy Japanese bombers. About the same time, Nichol's Field, Fort  McKinley and Cavite Naval Station were being heavily bombed. Nearly  half of the U.S. Army Air Corps planes were destroyed during the first  day of war, the day before Congress declared war.    Wounded were now arriving at the hospital by every available vehicle.  It was a horrible scene, an unforgettable sight, as corridors quickly  filled with seriously wounded and dying soldiers, lying in puddles of  blood, moaning, groaning, screaming, and begging for mercy.    Being the only Army doctor on Northern Luzon, I was to be tested as  never before in my life. I was a Regular Army professional soldier,  alone, and on my own. If we didn't act quickly, we would very soon  have many dead patients. I had seen many bad auto accidents, but never  anything like this. Shaking and woozy, I told myself, \"This is no time  to 'chicken out.' God, give me strength!\"    Mustering my strongest voice, I screamed: \"Everybody! Listen to me!  These patients are all bleeding. We've got to stop the bleeding  quickly - right now! Elevate extremities! Use anything you can get to  stop the bleeding! Tourniquets! Compression bandages! Hemostats! Even  your fingers, if they are clean! Bring all bad cases to the operating  room!\"    During the next thirty-two hours, our medical staff worked around the  clock, applying tourniquets and compression bandages, amputating arms  and legs (many dangling by only a few shreds of skin or tendons),  tying off bleeders, giving tetanus shots, laying the dead in the  garage for identification. As soon as we could get each patient  through his emergency, we sent him by ambulance to one of the civilian  hospitals in Baguio for definitive care, and a few miles distant from  any future bombing.    I was very fortunate in obtaining Dr. Beulah Allen (the wife of our  Post Quartermaster, Lt. Col. Henderson Allen), a retired surgeon, to  assist me. She was a tower of strength. While Dr. Allen and I were  operating, Civil War General Sherman's remarks that \"War is hell!\"  kept haunting me.    I was extremely proud of my medics; we took care of wounds, the likes  of which none of us had ever"]]]
