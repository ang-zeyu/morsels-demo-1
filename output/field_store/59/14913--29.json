For, not to meddle  with the state of Ireland, nor that of Guiana, there is vnder our noses the  great and ample countrey of Virginia; the In-land whereof is found of late  to bee so sweete, and holesome a climate, so rich and abundant in siluer  mines, so apt and capable of all commodities, which Italy, Spaine, and  France can affoord, that the Spaniards themselues in their owne writings  printed in Madrid 1586, and within few moneths afterward reprinted by me in  Paris, [Footnote: This no doubt refers to the \"History of the West Indies,\"  which appears further on in this edition.] and in a secret mappe of those  partes made in Mexico the yeere before; for the king of Spaine, (which  originall with many others is in the custodie of the excellent  Mathematician M. Thomas Hariot) as also in their intercepted letters come  vnto my hand, bearing date 1595, they acknowledge the In-land to be a  better and richer countrey then Mexico and Nueua Spania itselfe. And on the  other side their chiefest writers, as Peter Martyr ab Angleria, and Francis  Lopez de Gomara, the most learned Venetian Iohn Baptista Ramusius, and the  French Geographers, as namely, Popiliniere and the rest, acknowledge with  one consent, that all that mightie tract of land from 67., degrees  Northward to the latitude almost of Florida was first discouered out of  England, by the commaundement of king Henry the seuenth, and the South part  thereof before any other Christian people of late hath bene planted with  diuers English colonies by the royal consent of her sacred Maiestie vnder  the broad seale of England, whereof one as yet remaineth, for ought we  know, aliue in the countrey. Which action, if vpon a good and godly peace  obtained, it shal please the Almighty to stirre vp her Maiesties heart to  continue with her fauourable countenance (as vpon the ceasing of the warres  of Granada, hee stirred vp the spirite of Isabella Queene of Castile, to  aduance the enterprise of Columbus) with transporting of one or two  thousand of her people, and such others as vpon mine owne knowledge will  most willingly at their owne charges become Aduenturers in good numbers  with their bodies and goods; she shall by Gods assistance, in short space,  worke many great and vnlooked for effects, increase her dominions, enrich  her cofers, and reduce many Pagans to the faith of Christ. The neglecting  hitherto of which last point our aduersaries daily in many of their bookes  full bitterly lay vnto the charge of the professors of the Gospell. No  sooner should we set footing in that pleasant and good land, and erect one  or two conuenient Fortes in the Continent, or in some Iland neere the  maine, but euery step we tread would yeeld vs new occasion of action, which  I wish the Gentrie of our nation rather to regard, then to follow those  soft vnprofitable pleasures wherein they now too much consume their time  and patrimonie, and hereafter will doe much more, when as our neighbour  warres being appeased, they are like to haue lesse emploiment then nowe  they haue, vnlesse they bee occupied in this or some other the like  expedition. And to this ende and purpose giue me leaue (I beseech you) to  impart this occurrent to your honourable and prouident consideration: that  in the yere one thousand fiue hundred eighty and seuen, when I had caused  the foure voyages of Ribault, Laudonniere, and Gourges to Florida, at mine  owne charges to bee printed in Paris, which by the malice of some too much  affectioned to the Spanish faction, had bene aboue twentie yeeres  suppressed, as soone as that booke came to the view of that reuerend and  prudent Counseller Monsieur Harlac the lord chiefe Iustice of France, and  certaine other of the wisest Iudges, in great choler they asked, who had  done such intolerable wrong to their whole kingdome, as to haue concealed  that woorthie worke so long? Protesting further, that if their Kings and  the Estate had throughly followed that action, France had bene freed of  their long ciuill warres, and the variable humours of all sortes of people  might haue had very ample and manifold occasions of good and honest  emploiment abroad in that large and fruitfull Continent of the West Indies.  The application of which sentence vnto our selues I here omit, hastening  vnto the summarie recapitulation of other matters contained in this worke.  It may please your Honour therefore to vnderstand, that the second part of  this first Treatise containeth our auncient trade and traffique with  English shipping to the Ilands of Sicilie, Candie, and Sio, which, by good  warrant herein alleaged, I find to haue bene begun in the yeere 1511. and  to haue continued vntill the yeere 1552. and somewhat longer. But shortly  after (as it seemeth) it was intermitted, or rather giuen ouer (as is noted  in master Gaspar Campions discreet letters to Master Michael Lock and  Master William Winter inserted in this booke) first by occasion of the  Turkes expelling of the foure and twentie Mauneses or gouernours of the  Genouois out of the Ile of Sio, and by taking of the sayd Iland wholie into  his owne hand in Aprill, 1566. sending thither Piali Basha with fourescore  gallies for that purpose; and afterward by his growing ouer mightie and  troublesome in those Seas, by the cruell inuasion of Nicosia and Famagusta,  and the whole Ile of Cyprus by his lieutenant Generall Mustapha Basha.  Which lamentable Tragedie I haue here againe reuiued, that the posteritie  may neuer forget what trust may bee giuen to the oath of a Mahometan, when  hee hath aduauntage and is in his choler.    Lastly, I haue here put downe at large the happie renuing and much  increasing of our interrupted trade in all the Leuant, accomplished by the  great charges and speciall Industrie of the worshipfull and worthy  Citizens, Sir Edward Osborne Knight, M. Richard Staper, and M. William  Hareborne, together with the league for traffike onely betweene her  Maiestie and the Grand Signior, with the great priuileges, immunities, and  fauours obteyned of his imperiall Highnesse in that behalfe, the admissions  and residencies of our Ambassadours in his stately Porch, and the great  good and Christian offices which her Sacred Maiestie by her extraordinary  fauour in that Court hath done for the king and kingdome of Poland, and  other Christian Princes: the traffike of our Nation in all the chiefe  Hauens of Africa and Egypt: the searching and haunting the very bottome of  the Mediterran Sea to the ports of Tripoli and Alexandretta, of the  Archipelagus, by the Turkes now called The white sea, euen to the walles of  Constantinople: the voyages ouer land, and by riuer through Aleppo, Birrha,  Babylon and Balsara, and downe the Persian gulfe to Ormuz, and thence by  the Ocean sea to Goa, and againe ouer-land to Bisnagar, Cambaia, Orixa,  Bengala, Aracan, Pegu, Malacca, Siam, the Iangomes, Quicheu, and euen to  the Frontiers of the Empire of China: the former performed diuerse times by  sundry of our nation, and the last great voyage by M. Ralph Fitch, who with  M. Iohn Newbery and two other consorts departed from London with her  Maiesties letters written effectually in their fauour to the kings of  Cambaia and China in the yere 1583, who in the yeere 1591. like another  Paulus Venetus returned home to the place of his departure, with ample  relation of his wonderfull trauailes, which he presented in writing to my  Lord your father of honourable memorie.    Now here if any man shall take exception against this our new trade with  Turkes and misbeleeuers, he shall shew himselfe a man of small experience  in old and new Histories, or wilfully lead with partialitie, or some worse  humour. [Marginal note: 1. King. cap. 5., 2. Chron. cap. 2.] For who  knoweth not, that king Solomon of old, entred into league vpon necessitie  with Hiram the king of Tyrus, a gentile? Or who is ignorant that the  French, the Genouois, Florentines, Raguseans, Venetians, and Polonians are  at this day in league with the Grand Signior, and haue beene these many  yeeres, and haue vsed trade and traffike in his dominions? Who can deny  that the Emperor of Christendome hath had league with the Turke, and payd  him a long while a pension for a part of Hungarie? And who doth not  acknowledge, that either hath traueiled the remote parts of the world, or  read the Histories of this latter age, that the Spaniards and Portugales in  Barbarie, in the Indies, and elsewhere, haue ordinarie confederacie and  traffike with the Moores, and many kindes of Gentiles and Pagans, and that  which is more, doe pay them pensions, and vse them in their seruice and  warres? Why then should that be blamed in vs, which is vsuall and common to  the most part of other Christian nations? Therefore let our neighbours,  which haue found most fault with this new league and traffike, thanke  themselues and their owne foolish pride, whereby we were vrged to seeke  further to prouide vent for our naturall commodities. And herein the old  Greeke prouerbe was most truely verified, That euill counsaille prooueth  worst to the author and deuiser of the same.    Hauing thus farre intreated of the chiefe contents of the first part of  this second Volume, it remayneth that I briefly acquaint your Honor with  the chiefe contents of the second part. It may therefore please you to  vnderstand, that herein I haue likewise preserued, disposed, and set in  order such Voyages, Nauigations, Traffikes, and Discoueries, as our Nation,  and especially the worthy inhabitants of this citie of London, haue  painefully performed to the South and Southeast parts of the world, without  the Streight of Gibraltar, vpon the coasts of Africa, about the Cape of  Buona Speran√ßa, to and beyonde the East India.
