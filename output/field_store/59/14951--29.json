She did not even know he was ill.    ``All these things present themselves to us as indicating  not physiological operations of one brain acting on another,  but psychic actions of spirit upon spirit.  We feel that they  indicate to us some power unknown.    ``No doubt it is difficult to apportion what belongs to the spirit,  the soul, and what belongs to the brain.  We can only let ourselves  be guided in our judgment and our appreciations by the same  feeling that is created in us by the discussion of phenomena.  This is how all science has been started.  Well, and does not every  one feel that we have here to do with manifestations from beings  capable of thought, and not with material physiological facts only?    ``This impression is superabundantly confirmed by investigation concerning  the unknown faculties of the soul, when active in dreams and somnambulism.    ``A brother learns the death of his young sister by a terrible nightmare.    ``A young girl sees beforehand, in a dream, the man whom she will marry.    ``A mother sees her child lying in a road, covered with blood.    ``A lady goes, in a dream, to visit her husband on a distant steamer,  and her husband really receives this visit, which is seen by a third person.    ``A magnetized lady sees and describes the interior of the body  of her dying mother; what she said is confirmed by the autopsy.    ``A gentleman sees, in a dream, a lady whom he knows arriving at night  in a railroad station, her journey having been undertaken suddenly.    ``A magistrate sees three years in advance the commission of a crime,  down to its smallest details.    ``Several persons report that they have seen towns and landscapes  before they ever visited them, and have seen themselves in situations  in which they found themselves long after.    ``A mother hears her daughter announce her intended marriage six months  before it has been thought of.    ``Frequent cases of death are foretold with precision.    ``A theft is seen by a somnambulist, and the execution of  the criminal is foretold.    ``A young girl sees her fiance', or an intimate friend dying  (these are frequent cases), etc.    ``All these show unknown faculties in the soul.  Such at least  is my own impression.  It seems to me that we cannot reasonably  attribute the prevision of the future and mental sight to a nervous  action of the brain.    ``I think we must either deny these facts or admit that they must  have had an intellectual and spiritual cause of the psychic order,  and I recommend sceptics who do not desire to be convinced, to deny  them outright; to treat them as illusions and cases of a fortuitous  coincidence of circumstances.  They will find this easier.  Uncompromising deniers of facts, rebels against evidence,  may be all the more positive, and may declare that the writers  of these extraordinary narratives are persons fond of a joke,  who have written them to hoax me, and that there have been persons  in all ages who have done the same thing to mystify thinkers  who have taken up such questions.    ``These phenomena prove, I think, that the soul exists,  and that it is endowed with faculties at present unknown.  That is the logical way of commencing our study, which in the end  may lead us to the problem of the after-life and immortality.  A thought can be transmitted to the mind of another.  There are mental transmissions, communications of thoughts,  and psychic currents between human souls.  Space appears  to be no obstacle in these cases, and time sometimes seems  to be annihilated.''    A few years ago a person whom I will designate as ``A'' related a dream  to me as follows:  ``I take no interest in pugilism or pugilists,  but I saw, in a dream, every detail of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons mill,  four days before it took place out West.  Two nights before the fight I  had a second dream in which a favorite horse was running, but suddenly,  just before the judge's stand was passed, a hitherto unobserved little black  horse ran ahead and the crowd shouted in my ears, `Fitzsimmons wins!' ''    ``B'' relates the following as a dream:  ``I saw the American soldiers,  in clay-colored uniform, bearing the flag of victory two weeks  before the Spanish-American war was declared, and of course before  any living being could have known the uniform to be adopted.  Later I saw, several days before the actual occurrence happened,  the destruction of Cervera's fleet by the American navy.''  Signed ``B.''    ``Just after the South African hostilities began, I saw in a dream  a fierce struggle between the British and Boers, in which the former  suffered severe losses.  A few nights after I had a second dream  in which I saw the contending forces in a long-drawn contest,  very disastrous to both, and in which neither could claim a victory.  They seemed to be fighting to a frazzle.''  Signed ``C.''    ``D'' related to me at the time of the occurrence of the dream the following:  ``It had been suggested to me that the two cereals, corn and wheat, were too  far apart, and that I ought to buy corn.  At noon I lay down on a lounge  to await luncheon; I had barely closed my eyes before a voice whispered:  `Don't buy, but sell that corn.'  `What do you mean?'  I asked.  `Sell at the present price, and buy at 23 7/8.' '' The foregoing dream was  related to me by a practical, successful business man who never speculates.  I watched the corn market and know it took the turns indicated in the dream.    In this dream we find the dreamer conversing with some strange  intelligence possessed of knowledge unknown to objective reason.  It could not, therefore, have been the waking thoughts  of the dreamer, for he possessed no such information.  Was the message superinduced through the energies and  activities of the waking mind on the subjective mind?  This could not have been, because he had no such thoughts;  besides, the intelligence given was free from the errors  of the calculating and anxious waking mind.    We must therefore look to other sources for an explanation.  Was it  the higher self that manifested to Abraham in the dim ages of the world?  Was it the Divine Voice that gave solace to Krishna in his abstraction?  Was it the unerring light that preceded Gautama into the strange solitudes  of Asia?  Was it the small voice that Elijah heard in the desert  of Shurr?  Was it the Comforter of Jesus in the wilderness and the garden  of distress?  Or, was it Paul's indwelling spirit of this earthly tabernacle?  One thing we may truthfully affirm--that it did not proceed from the rational,  objective mind of the rank materialist, who would close all doors to that  inner life and consciousness where all true religion finds its birthmark,  its hope, its promises and its faith; which, rightly understood,  will leave to the horrors of the Roman crucifixion the twin thieves,  superstition and scepticism, while the angel of ``Goodwill'' will go  free to solace the world with the fruit and fragrance of enduring power  and promise{.} The steel chains that fasten these hydra-headed crocodiles  of sensuous poison around love and destiny can only be severed by the diamond  of wisdom and knowledge.    A citizen worthy of confidence relates the following dream:  ``In December, 1878, I saw in a dream my brother-in-law, Henry Yarnell,  suffering from a bloody knife wound; after this I awoke, but soon  fell asleep again.  The second time I dreamed of a similar scene,  except that the wound was the result of a shotgun.  After this I  did not go to sleep again.  I was much troubled about my dream,  and soon started in the direction of my brother-in-law's house.  I had not gone far, when I met an acquaintance who promptly informed  me that my brother-in-law had been shot.''  Signed ``E.''    A well-known resident of Chattanooga, Tenn., formerly of New York City,  will vouch for the accuracy of the following incident in his life:    ``On February 19, 1878, I was boarding with a family on Christopher street,  New York, while my wife and baby were visiting my parents in the country,  a short distance from the city.  Our baby was taken sick.  The malady developed into brain fever, followed by water on the brain,  causing the little one's death.    ``At our boarding-place there was at the time a quartette of us  grass widowers, as we called ourselves, and in order to pass away  the time pleasantly we had organized a `grass widowers' euchre club.'  We used to meet almost every evening after dinner in the dining-room,  and play until about eleven o'clock, when we would retire.  On the above date I dreamed that after playing our usual evening  games we took our departure for our rooms, and on the way up  the second flight of stairs I heard a slight movement behind me;  on looking around I found I was being followed by a tall figure  robed in a long, loose white gown, which came down to the floor.  The figure seemed to be that of a man--I would say, about seven  feet tall--who followed me up the second flight and along  the hallway, entering my room.  After coming in the door he made  a circle of the room and seemed to be looking for something,  and when he approached the door to make his exit he stopped still,  and with a gesture of his hand remarked, `I have taken all you have.'  On the following morning, about 9:30 o'clock, I received a telegram  from my wife announcing the death of our only baby.''  Signed ``F.''    A well-known citizen of Chattanooga, Tenn., relates and vouches  for the truth of the following occurrence:    ``Several years ago, when a boy, I had a schoolmate and friend, Willie T.,  between whom and myself there sprung up a mutual feeling of high regard.  We were chums in the sense that we were almost constantly together, both at  school and at home, and among the partnerships we formed was one of having  amateur shadowgraph and panoramic shows in the basement of Willie's home.  This much to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9368"],[0,"Welsh Fairy Tales (#2)"],[1,"the  more hungry and eager for fresh human victims to eat, especially juicy  maidens; just as children like cake more than bread.    The Cymric men were not surprised at this, for they knew that girls  were very sweet and they almost worshiped women. So they learned to  guard their daughters and wives. They saw that to do such things as  eating up people was in the nature of the beast, which could never be  taught good manners.    But what made them mad beyond measure was the trick which the monster  often played upon them by breaking the river banks, and the dykes  which with great toil they had built to protect their crops. Then the  waters overflowed all their farms, ruined their gardens and spoiled  their cow houses and stables.    This sort of mischief the Afang liked to play, especially about the  time when the oat and barley crops were ripe and ready to be gathered  to make cakes and flummery; that is sour oat-jelly, or pap. So it  often happened that the children had to do without their cookies and  porridge during the winter. Sometimes the floods rose so high as to  wash away the houses and float the cradles. Even those with little  babies in them were often seen on the raging waters, and sent dancing  on the waves down the river, to the sea.    Once in a while, a mother cat and all her kittens were seen mewing for  help, or a lady dog howling piteously. Often it happened that both  puppies and kittens were drowned.    So, whether for men or mothers, pussies or puppies, the Cymric men  thought the time had come to stop this monster's mischief. It was bad  enough that people should be eaten up, but to have all their crops  ruined and animals drowned, so that they had to go hungry all winter,  with only a little fried fish, and no turnips, was too much for human  patience. There were too many weeping mothers and sorrowful fathers,  and squalling brats and animals whining for something to eat.    Besides, if all the oats were washed away, how could their wives make  flummery, without which, no Cymric man is ever happy? And where would  they get seed for another year's sowing? And if there were no cows,  how could the babies or kitties live, or any grown-up persons get  buttermilk?    Someone may ask, why did not some brave man shoot the Afang, with a  poisoned arrow, or drive a spear into him under the arms, where the  flesh was tender, or cut off his head with a sharp sword?    The trouble was just here. There were plenty of brave fellows, ready  to fight the monster, but nothing made of iron could pierce that hide  of his. This was like armor, or one of the steel battleships of our  day, and the Afang always spit out fire or poison breath down the  road, up which a man was coming, long before the brave fellow could  get near him. Nothing would do, but to go up into his lair, and drag  him out.    But what man or company of men was strong enough to do this, when a  dozen giants in a gang, with ropes as thick as a ship's hawser, could  hardly tackle the job?    Nevertheless, in what neither man nor giant could do, a pretty maiden  might succeed. True, she must be brave also, for how could she know,  but if hungry, the Afang might eat her up?    However, one valiant damsel, of great beauty, who had lots of  perfumery and plenty of pretty clothes, volunteered to bind the  monster in his lair. She said, \"I'm not afraid.\" Her sweetheart was  named Gadern, and he was a young and strong hunter. He talked over the  matter with her and they two resolved to act together.    Gadern went all over the country, summoning the farmers to bring their  ox teams and log chains. Then he set the blacksmiths to work, forging  new and especially heavy ones, made of the best native iron, from the  mines, for which Wales is still famous.    Meanwhile, the lovely maiden arrayed herself in her prettiest clothes,  dressed her hair in the most enticing way, hanging a white blossom on  each side, over her ears, with one flower also at her neck.    When she had perfumed her garments, she sallied forth and up the lake  where the big bog and the waters were and where the monster hid  himself.    While the maiden was still quite a distance away, the terrible Afang,  scenting his visitor from afar, came rushing out of his lair. When  very near, he reared his head high in the air, expecting to pounce on  her, with his iron clad claws and at one swallow make a breakfast of  the girl.    But the odors of her perfumes were so sweet, that he forgot what he  had thought to do. Moreover, when he looked at her, he was so taken  with unusual beauty, that he flopped at once on his forefeet. Then he  behaved just like a lovelorn beau, when his best girl comes near. He  ties his necktie and pulls down his coat and brushes off the collar.    So the Afang began to spruce up. It was real fun to see how a monster  behaves when smitten with love for a pretty girl. He had no idea how  funny he was.    The girl was not at all afraid, but smoothed the monster's back,  stroked and played with its big moustaches and tickled its neck until  the Afang's throat actually gurgled with a laugh. Pretty soon he  guffawed, for he was so delighted.    When he did this, the people down in the valley thought it was  thunder, though the sky was clear and blue.    The maiden tickled his chin, and even put up his whiskers in curl  papers. Then she stroked his neck, so that his eyes closed. Soon she  had gently lulled him to slumber, by singing a cradle song, which her  mother had taught her. This she did so softly, and sweetly, that in a  few minutes, with its head in her lap, the monster was sound asleep  and even began to snore.    Then, quietly, from their hiding places in the bushes, Gadern and his  men crawled out. When near the dreaded Afang, they stood up and  sneaked forward, very softly on tip toe. They had wrapped the links of  the chain in grass and leaves, so that no clanking was heard. They  also held the oxen's yokes, so that nobody or anything could rattle,  or make any noise. Slowly but surely they passed the chain over its  body, in the middle, besides binding the brute securely between its  fore and hind legs.    All this time, the monster slept on, for the girl kept on crooning her  melody.    When the forty yoke of oxen were all harnessed together, the drovers  cracked all their whips at once, so that it sounded like a clap of  thunder and the whole team began to pull together.    Then the Afang woke up with a start.    The sudden jerk roused the monster to wrath, and its bellowing was  terrible. It rolled round and round, and dug its four sets of toes,  each with three claws, every one as big as a plowshare, into the  ground. It tried hard to crawl into its lair, or slip into the lake.    Finding that neither was possible, the Afang looked about, for some  big tree to wrap its tail around. But all his writhings or plungings  were of no use. The drovers plied their whips and the oxen kept on  with one long pull together and forward. They strained so hard, that  one of them dropped its eye out. This formed a pool, and to this day  they call it The Pool of the Ox's Eye. It never dries up or overflows,  though the water in it rises and falls, as regularly as the tides.    For miles over the mountains the sturdy oxen hauled the monster. The  pass over which they toiled and strained so hard is still named the  Pass of the Oxen's Slope. When going down hill, the work of dragging  the Afang was easier.    In a great hole in the ground, big enough to be a pond, they dumped  the carcass of the Afang, and soon a little lake was formed. This  uncanny bit of water is called \"The Lake of the Green Well.\" It is  considered dangerous for man or beast to go too near it. Birds do not  like to fly over the surface, and when sheep tumble in, they sink to  the bottom at once.    If the bones of the Afang still lie at the bottom, they must have sunk  down very deep, for the monster had no more power to get out, or to  break the river banks. The farmers no longer cared anything about the  creature, and they hardly every think of the old story, except when a  sheep is lost.    As for Gadern and his brave and lovely sweetheart, they were married  and lived long and happily. Their descendants, in the thirty-seventh  generation, are proud of the grand exploit of their ancestors, while  all the farmers honor his memory and bless the name of the lovely girl  that put the monster asleep.          III      THE TWO CAT WITCHES      In old days, it was believed that the seventh son, in a family of  sons, was a conjurer by nature. That is, he could work wonders like  the fairies and excel the doctors in curing diseases.    If he were the seventh son of a seventh son, he was himself a wonder  of wonders. The story ran that he could even cure the \"shingles,\"  which is a very troublesome disease. It is called also by a Latin  name, which means a snake, because, as it gets worse, it coils itself  around the body.    Now the eagle can attack the serpent and conquer and kill this  poisonous creature. To secure such power, Hugh, the conjurer, ate the  flesh of eagles. When he wished to cure the serpent-disease, he  uttered words in the form of a charm which acted as a talisman and  cure. After wetting the red rash, which had broken out over the sick  person's body, he muttered:    \"He-eagle, she-eagle, I send you over nine seas, and over nine  mountains, and over nine acres of moor and fen, where no dog shall  bark, no cow low, and no eagle shall higher rise.\"    After that, the patient was sure that he felt better.    There was always great rivalry between these conjurers and those who  made money from the Pilgrims at Holy Wells and visitors to the relic  shrines, but this fellow, named Hugh, and the monks, kept on mutually  good terms. They often ate dinner together, for Hugh was a great  traveler over the whole country and always had news to tell to the  holy brothers who lived in"]]]
