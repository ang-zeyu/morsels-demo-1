If he can't, I'll shoot the beast!\"    \"Shoot him?\" echoed Bull Hunter. He took a pace back, and his big,  boyish face clouded to a frown. \"Not that, I guess!\"    \"Why not?\" asked Bridewell, curious at the change in the big stranger.  \"Why not? What good is he?\"    \"Why--he's good just to look at. I'd keep him just for that.\"    \"And you can have him just for that--if you can manage to handle him.  Want to try?\"    Bull shook his head. \"I don't know nothing about horses,\" he confessed  again. He glanced at the skeleton of standing beams. \"Building a  barn, eh?\"    \"You wouldn't call it pitching hay or shoeing a hoss that I'm doing, I  guess,\" said the old fellow crossly. \"I'm fussing at building a barn,  but a fine chance I got. I get all my timber here--look at that!\"    He indicated the stacks of beams and lumber around him.    \"And then I get some men out of town to work with me on it. But they  get lonely. Don't like working on a ranch. Besides, they had a scrap  with me. I wouldn't have 'em loafing around the job. Rather have no  help at all than have a loafer helping me. So they quit. Then I tried  to get my cowhands to give me a lift, but they wouldn't touch a  hammer. Specialists in cows is what they say they are, ding bust 'em!  So here I am trying to do something and doing nothing. How can I  handle a beam that it takes three men to lift?\"    He illustrated by going to a stack of long and massive timbers and  tugging at the end of one of them. He was able to raise that end only  a few inches.    \"You see?\"    Bull nodded.    \"Suppose you give me the job handling the timbers?\" he suggested. \"I  ain't much good with a hammer and nails, but I might manage  the lifting.\"    \"All by yourself? One man?\" he eyed the bulk of Bull hopefully for a  moment, then the light faded from his face. \"Nope, you couldn't raise  'em. Not them joists yonder!\"    \"I think I could,\" said Bull.    Old Bridewell thrust out his jaw. He had been a combative man in his  youth; and he still had the instinct of a fighter.    \"I got ten dollars,\" he said, \"that says you can't lift that beam and  put her up on end! That one right there, that I tried to lift a  minute ago!\"    \"All right,\" Bull nodded.    \"You're on for the bet?\" the old man chuckled gayly. \"All right. Let's  see you give a heave!\"    Bull Hunter obediently stepped to the timber. It was a twelve footer  of bulky dimensions, heavy wood not thoroughly seasoned. Yet he did  not approach one end of it. He laid his immense hands on the center of  it. Old Bridewell chuckled to himself softly as he watched; he was  beginning to feel that the big stranger was a little simple-minded.  His chuckling ceased when he saw the timber cant over on one edge.    \"Look out!\" he called, for Bull had slipped his hand under the lifted  side. \"You'll get your fingers smashed plumb off that way.\"    \"I have to get a hold under it, you see,\" explained Bull calmly, and  so saying his knees sagged a little and when they straightened the  timber rose lightly in his hands and was placed on his shoulder.    \"Where'd you like to have it?\" asked Bull.    Bridewell rubbed his eyes. \"Yonder,\" he said faintly.    Bull walked to the designated place, the great timber teetering up and  down, quivering with the jar of each stride. There he swung one end to  the ground and thrust the other up until it was erect.    \"Is this the way you want it?\" said Bull.    By this time Bridewell had recovered his self-possession to some  degree, yet his eyes were wide as he approached.    \"Yep. Just let it lean agin' that corner piece, will you, Hunter?\"    Bull obeyed.    \"That might make a fellow's shoulder sort of sore,\" he remarked, \"if  he had to carry those timbers all day.\"    \"All day?\" gasped Bridewell, and then he saw that the giant, indeed,  was not even panting from his effort. He was already turning his  attention to the pile of timbers.    \"Here,\" he said, reluctantly drawing out some money. \"Here's your  ten.\"    But Bull refused it. \"Can't take it,\" he explained. \"I just made the  bet by way of talk. You see, I knew I could lift it; and you didn't  have any real idea about me. Besides, if I'd lost I couldn't have  paid. I haven't any money.\"    He said this so gravely and simply that old Bridewell watched him  quizzically, half suspecting that there was a touch of irony hidden  somewhere. It gradually dawned on him that a man who was flat broke  was refusing money which he had won fairly on a bet. The idea  staggered Bridewell. He was within an ace of putting Bull Hunter down  as a fool. Something held him back, through some underlying respect  for the physical might of the big man and a respect, also, for the  honesty which looked out of his eyes. He pocketed the money slowly. He  was never averse to saving.    \"But I've been thinking,\" said Bull, as he sadly watched the money  disappear, \"that you might be needing me to help you put up the barn?  Do you think you could hire me?\"    \"H'm,\" grumbled Bridewell. \"You think you could handle these big  timbers all day?\"    \"Yes,\" said Bull, \"if none of 'em are any bigger than that last one.  Yes, I could handle 'em all day easily.\"    It was impossible to doubt that he said this judiciously and not with  a desire to overstate his powers. In spite of himself the old  rancher believed.    \"You see,\" explained Bull eagerly, \"you said that you needed three men  for that work. That's why I ask.\"    \"And I suppose you'd want the pay of three men?\"    Bull shook his head. \"Anything you want to pay me,\" he declared.    The rancher frowned. This sounded like the beginning of a shrewd  bargain, and his respect and suspicion were equally increased.    \"Suppose you say what you want?\" he asked.    \"Well,\" Bull said slowly, \"I'd have to have a place to sleep. And--I'm  a pretty big eater.\"    \"I guess you are,\" said Bridewell. \"But if you do three men's work you  got a right to three men's food. What else do you want?\"    Bull considered, as though there were few other wishes that he could  express. \"I haven't any money,\" he apologized. \"D'you think maybe you  could pay me a little something outside of food and a place to sleep?\"    Bridewell blinked, and then prepared himself to become angry, when it  dawned on him that this was not intended for sarcasm. He found that  Bull was searching his face eagerly, as though he feared that he were  asking too much.    \"What would do you?\" suggested Bridewell tentatively.    \"I dunno,\" said Bull, sighing with relief. \"Anything you think.\"    It was plain that the big man was half-witted--or nearly so. Bridewell  kept the sparkle of exultation out of his eyes.    \"You leave it to me, then, and I'll do what's more'n right by you.  When d'you want to start work?\"    \"Right now.\"          CHAPTER 15      When Bull left the dining room that night after supper, Mrs. Bridewell  looked across the table at her husband with horror in her eyes.    \"Did you see?\" she gasped. \"He ate the _whole_ pot of beans!\"    \"Sure I seen him,\" and he grinned.    \"But--he'll eat us out of house and home! Why, he's like a wolf!\"    Bridewell chuckled with superior knowledge. \"He's ate enough for  three,\" he admitted, \"but he's worked enough for six--besides, most of  his wages come in food. But work? I never seen anything like it! He  handled more timbers than a dozen. When it come to spiking them in  place he seen me swinging that twelve-pound sledge and near breaking  my back. 'I think it's easier this way,' he says. 'Besides you can hit  a lot faster if you use just one hand.' And he takes the hammer, and  sends that big spike in all the way to the head with one lick. And he  wondered why I didn't work the same way! Ain't got any idea how  strong he is.\"    Mrs. Bridewell listened with wide eyes. \"The idea,\" she murmured. \"The  idea! Where's he now?\"    Her husband went to the back door. \"He's sitting over by the pump  talking to Tod. Sitting talking like they was one age. I reckon he's  sort of half-witted.\"    \"How come?\" sharply asked Mrs. Bridewell. \"Ain't Tod got more brains  than most growed-up men?\"    \"I reckon he has,\" admitted the proud father.    And if they had put the same question to Bull Hunter, the giant would  have agreed with them emphatically. He approached the child tamer of  Diablo with a diffidence that was almost reverence. The freckle-faced  boy looked up from his whittling when the shadow of Bull fell athwart  him, with an equal admiration; also with suspicion, for the  cowpunchers, on the whole, were apt to make game of the youngster and  his grave, grown-up ways. He was, therefore, shrewdly suspicious of  jests at his expense.    Furthermore, he had seen the big stranger heaving the great timbers  about and whirling the sledge with one hand; he half suspected that  the jokes might be pointed with the weight of that heavy hand. His  amazement was accordingly great when he found the big man actually  sitting down beside him, cross-legged, and he was absolutely stupefied  when Bull Hunter said, \"I've been aiming at this chance to talk to  you, Tod, all day.\"    \"H'm,\" grunted Tod noncommittally, and examined the other with a  cautious side glance.    But the face of Bull Hunter was unutterably free from guile. Tod  instantly began to adjust himself. The men he most worshiped were the  lean, swift, profanely formidable cowpunchers. But there was something  in him that responded with a thrill to this accepted equality with  such a man as Bull Hunter. Even his father he had seen stricken to an  awed silence at the sight of Bull's prowess.    \"You see,\" explained Bull frankly, \"I been wondering how you managed  to handle Diablo the way you do.\"    Tod chuckled. \"It's just a trick. You watch me a while with him,  you'll soon catch on.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#20)"],[1,"Valley, Guntawang, Tallawang, and Cooyal, and those  places round there, and he was doing well.    Mary had heard of a light American waggonette, when the steers went--a  tray-body arrangement, and she thought she'd do with that. 'It would  be better than the buggy, Joe,' she said--'there'd be more room for  the children, and, besides, I could take butter and eggs to Gulgong,  or Cobborah, when we get a few more cows.' Then James heard of a small  flock of sheep that a selector--who was about starved off his selection  out Talbragar way--wanted to get rid of. James reckoned he could get  them for less than half-a-crown a-head. We'd had a heavy shower of rain,  that came over the ranges and didn't seem to go beyond our boundaries.  Mary said, 'It's a pity to see all that grass going to waste, Joe.  Better get those sheep and try your luck with them. Leave some money  with me, and I'll send James over for them. Never mind about the  buggy--we'll get that when we're on our feet.'    So James rode across to Talbragar and drove a hard bargain with that  unfortunate selector, and brought the sheep home. There were about two  hundred, wethers and ewes, and they were young and looked a good breed  too, but so poor they could scarcely travel; they soon picked up,  though. The drought was blazing all round and Out-Back, and I think that  my corner of the ridges was the only place where there was any grass to  speak of. We had another shower or two, and the grass held out. Chaps  began to talk of 'Joe Wilson's luck'.    I would have liked to shear those sheep; but I hadn't time to get a shed  or anything ready--along towards Christmas there was a bit of a boom  in the carrying line. Wethers in wool were going as high as thirteen  to fifteen shillings at the Homebush yards at Sydney, so I arranged to  truck the sheep down from the river by rail, with another small lot that  was going, and I started James off with them. He took the west road, and  down Guntawang way a big farmer who saw James with the sheep (and who  was speculating, or adding to his stock, or took a fancy to the wool)  offered James as much for them as he reckoned I'd get in Sydney, after  paying the carriage and the agents and the auctioneer. James put the  sheep in a paddock and rode back to me. He was all there where riding  was concerned. I told him to let the sheep go. James made a Greener  shot-gun, and got his saddle done up, out of that job.    I took up a couple more forty-acre blocks--one in James's name, to  encourage him with the fencing. There was a good slice of land in an  angle between the range and the creek, farther down, which everybody  thought belonged to Wall, the squatter, but Mary got an idea, and went  to the local land office and found out that it was 'unoccupied Crown  land', and so I took it up on pastoral lease, and got a few more  sheep--I'd saved some of the best-looking ewes from the last lot.    One evening--I was going down next day for a load of fencing-wire for  myself--Mary said,--    'Joe! do you know that the Matthews have got a new double buggy?'    The Matthews were a big family of cockatoos, along up the main road, and  I didn't think much of them. The sons were all 'bad-eggs', though the  old woman and girls were right enough.    'Well, what of that?' I said. 'They're up to their neck in debt, and  camping like black-fellows in a big bark humpy. They do well to go  flashing round in a double buggy.'    'But that isn't what I was going to say,' said Mary. 'They want to sell  their old single buggy, James says. I'm sure you could get it for six or  seven pounds; and you could have it done up.'    'I wish James to the devil!' I said. 'Can't he find anything better to  do than ride round after cock-and-bull yarns about buggies?'    'Well,' said Mary, 'it was James who got the steers and the sheep.'    Well, one word led to another, and we said things we didn't mean--but  couldn't forget in a hurry. I remember I said something about Mary  always dragging me back just when I was getting my head above water and  struggling to make a home for her and the children; and that hurt her,  and she spoke of the 'homes' she'd had since she was married. And that  cut me deep.    It was about the worst quarrel we had. When she began to cry I got my  hat and went out and walked up and down by the creek. I hated anything  that looked like injustice--I was so sensitive about it that it made  me unjust sometimes. I tried to think I was right, but I couldn't--it  wouldn't have made me feel any better if I could have thought so. I got  thinking of Mary's first year on the selection and the life she'd had  since we were married.    When I went in she'd cried herself to sleep. I bent over and, 'Mary,' I  whispered.    She seemed to wake up.    'Joe--Joe!' she said.    'What is it Mary?' I said.    'I'm pretty well sure that old Spot's calf isn't in the pen. Make James  go at once!'    Old Spot's last calf was two years old now; so Mary was talking in her  sleep, and dreaming she was back in her first year.    We both laughed when I told her about it afterwards; but I didn't feel  like laughing just then.    Later on in the night she called out in her sleep,--    'Joe--Joe! Put that buggy in the shed, or the sun will blister the  varnish!'    I wish I could say that that was the last time I ever spoke unkindly to  Mary.    Next morning I got up early and fried the bacon and made the tea, and  took Mary's breakfast in to her--like I used to do, sometimes, when we  were first married. She didn't say anything--just pulled my head down  and kissed me.    When I was ready to start Mary said,--    'You'd better take the spring-cart in behind the dray and get the tyres  cut and set. They're ready to drop off, and James has been wedging them  up till he's tired of it. The last time I was out with the children  I had to knock one of them back with a stone: there'll be an accident  yet.'    So I lashed the shafts of the cart under the tail of the waggon, and  mean and ridiculous enough the cart looked, going along that way. It  suggested a man stooping along handcuffed, with his arms held out and  down in front of him.    It was dull weather, and the scrubs looked extra dreary and endless--and  I got thinking of old things. Everything was going all right with me,  but that didn't keep me from brooding sometimes--trying to hatch out  stones, like an old hen we had at home. I think, taking it all round, I  used to be happier when I was mostly hard-up--and more generous. When I  had ten pounds I was more likely to listen to a chap who said, 'Lend me  a pound-note, Joe,' than when I had fifty; THEN I fought shy of careless  chaps--and lost mates that I wanted afterwards--and got the name of  being mean. When I got a good cheque I'd be as miserable as a miser over  the first ten pounds I spent; but when I got down to the last I'd buy  things for the house. And now that I was getting on, I hated to spend  a pound on anything. But then, the farther I got away from poverty the  greater the fear I had of it--and, besides, there was always before us  all the thought of the terrible drought, with blazing runs as bare and  dusty as the road, and dead stock rotting every yard, all along the  barren creeks.    I had a long yarn with Mary's sister and her husband that night in  Gulgong, and it brightened me up. I had a fancy that that sort of a  brother-in-law made a better mate than a nearer one; Tom Tarrant had  one, and he said it was sympathy. But while we were yarning I couldn't  help thinking of Mary, out there in the hut on the Creek, with no one to  talk to but the children, or James, who was sulky at home, or Black  Mary or Black Jimmy (our black boy's father and mother), who weren't  oversentimental. Or maybe a selector's wife (the nearest was five  miles away), who could talk only of two or three things--'lambin'' and  'shearin'' and 'cookin' for the men', and what she said to her old man,  and what he said to her--and her own ailments--over and over again.    It's a wonder it didn't drive Mary mad!--I know I could never listen to  that woman more than an hour. Mary's sister said,--    'Now if Mary had a comfortable buggy, she could drive in with the  children oftener. Then she wouldn't feel the loneliness so much.'    I said 'Good night' then and turned in. There was no getting away from  that buggy. Whenever Mary's sister started hinting about a buggy, I  reckoned it was a put-up job between them.          III. The Ghost of Mary's Sacrifice.      When I got to Gudgeegong I stopped at Galletly's coach-shop to leave the  cart. The Galletlys were good fellows: there were two brothers--one was  a saddler and harness-maker. Big brown-bearded men--the biggest men in  the district, 'twas said.    Their old man had died lately and left them some money; they had men,  and only worked in their shops when they felt inclined, or there was a  special work to do; they were both first-class tradesmen. I went into  the painter's shop to have a look at a double buggy that Galletly had  built for a man who couldn't pay cash for it when it was finished--and  Galletly wouldn't trust him.    There it stood, behind a calico screen that the coach-painters used to  keep out the dust when they were varnishing. It was a first-class piece  of work--pole, shafts, cushions, whip, lamps, and all complete. If you  only wanted to drive one horse you could take out the pole and put in  the shafts, and there you were. There was a tilt over the front seat;  if you only wanted the buggy to carry two, you could fold down the back  seat, and there you had a handsome, roomy, single buggy. It would go  near fifty pounds.    While I was looking at it, Bill Galletly came in, and slapped me on the  back.    'Now, there's a chance for you, Joe!' he said. 'I saw you rubbing your  head round that buggy the last time you were in. You wouldn't get a  better one in the colonies, and you won't"]]]
