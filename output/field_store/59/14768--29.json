It's a funny thing, I'm not  afraid to go by myself, but when Pa's along I always want to hold on to  him. Habit, I guess, and then there's no denying that this time I was a  bit scared.    You see, it's this way. We know that everything is dead out there. Pa  heard the last radio voices fade away years ago, and had seen some of  the last folks die who weren't as lucky or well-protected as us. So we  knew that if there was something groping around out there, it couldn't  be anything human or friendly.    Besides that, there's a feeling that comes with it always being night,  _cold_ night. Pa says there used to be some of that feeling even in the  old days, but then every morning the Sun would come and chase it away.  I have to take his word for that, not ever remembering the Sun as being  anything more than a big star. You see, I hadn't been born when the  dark star snatched us away from the Sun, and by now it's dragged us out  beyond the orbit of the planet Pluto, Pa says, and taking us farther  out all the time.    I found myself wondering whether there mightn't be something on the  dark star that wanted us, and if that was why it had captured the  Earth. Just then we came to the end of the corridor and I followed Pa  out on the balcony.    I don't know what the city looked like in the old days, but now it's  beautiful. The starlight lets you see it pretty well--there's quite a  bit of light in those steady points speckling the blackness above. (Pa  says the stars used to twinkle once, but that was because there was  air.) We are on a hill and the shimmery plain drops away from us and  then flattens out, cut up into neat squares by the troughs that used to  be streets. I sometimes make my mashed potatoes look like it, before I  pour on the gravy.    Some taller buildings push up out of the feathery plain, topped  by rounded caps of air crystals, like the fur hood Ma wears, only  whiter. On those buildings you can see the darker squares of windows,  underlined by white dashes of air crystals. Some of them are on a  slant, for many of the buildings are pretty badly twisted by the quakes  and all the rest that happened when the dark star captured the Earth.    Here and there a few icicles hang, water icicles from the first days  of the cold, other icicles of frozen air that melted on the roofs and  dripped and froze again. Sometimes one of those icicles will catch the  light of a star and send it to you so brightly you think the star has  swooped into the city. That was one of the things Pa had been thinking  of when I told him about the light, but I had thought of it myself  first and known it wasn't so.    He touched his helmet to mine so we could talk easier and he asked me  to point out the windows to him. But there wasn't any light moving  around inside them now, or anywhere else. To my surprise, Pa didn't  bawl me out and tell me I'd been seeing things. He looked all around  quite a while after filling his pail, and just as we were going inside  he whipped around without warning, as if to take some peeping thing  off guard.    I could feel it, too. The old peace was gone. There was something  lurking out there, watching, waiting, getting ready.    Inside, he said to me, touching helmets, \"If you see something like  that again, son, don't tell the others. Your Ma's sort of nervous these  days and we owe her all the feeling of safety we can give her. Once--it  was when your sister was born--I was ready to give up and die, but your  Mother kept me trying. Another time she kept the fire going a whole  week all by herself when I was sick. Nursed me and took care of the two  of you, too.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"You know that game we sometimes play, sitting in a square in the Nest,  tossing a ball around? Courage is like a ball, son. A person can hold  it only so long, and then he's got to toss it to someone else. When  it's tossed your way, you've got to catch it and hold it tight--and  hope there'll be someone else to toss it to when you get tired of being  brave.\"    His talking to me that way made me feel grown-up and good. But it  didn't wipe away the thing outside from the back of my mind--or the  fact that Pa took it seriously.           *       *       *       *       *    It's hard to hide your feelings about such a thing. When we got back in  the Nest and took off our outside clothes, Pa laughed about it all and  told them it was nothing and kidded me for having such an imagination,  but his words fell flat. He didn't convince Ma and Sis any more than  he did me. It looked for a minute like we were all fumbling the  courage-ball. Something had to be done, and almost before I knew what  I was going to say, I heard myself asking Pa to tell us about the old  days, and how it all happened.    He sometimes doesn't mind telling that story, and Sis and I sure like  to listen to it, and he got my idea. So we were all settled around the  fire in a wink, and Ma pushed up some cans to thaw for supper, and Pa  began. Before he did, though, I noticed him casually get a hammer from  the shelf and lay it down beside him.    It was the same old story as always--I think I could recite the main  thread of it in my sleep--though Pa always puts in a new detail or two  and keeps improving it in spots.    He told us how the Earth had been swinging around the Sun ever so  steady and warm, and the people on it fixing to make money and wars and  have a good time and get power and treat each other right or wrong,  when without warning there comes charging out of space this dead star,  this burned out sun, and upsets everything.    You know, I find it hard to believe in the way those people felt,  any more than I can believe in the swarming number of them. Imagine  people getting ready for the horrible sort of war they were cooking up.  Wanting it even, or at least wishing it were over so as to end their  nervousness. As if all folks didn't have to hang together and pool  every bit of warmth just to keep alive. And how can they have hoped to  end danger, any more than we can hope to end the cold?    Sometimes I think Pa exaggerates and makes things out too black. He's  cross with us once in a while and was probably cross with all those  folks. Still, some of the things I read in the old magazines sound  pretty wild. He may be right.           *       *       *       *       *    The dark star, as Pa went on telling it, rushed in pretty fast and  there wasn't much time to get ready. At the beginning they tried  to keep it a secret from most people, but then the truth came out,  what with the earthquakes and floods--imagine, oceans of _unfrozen_  water!--and people seeing stars blotted out by something on a clear  night. First off they thought it would hit the Sun, and then they  thought it would hit the Earth. There was even the start of a rush to  get to a place called China, because people thought the star would hit  on the other side. But then they found it wasn't going to hit either  side, but was going to come very close to the Earth.    Most of the other planets were on the other side of the Sun and didn't  get involved. The Sun and the newcomer fought over the Earth for a  little while--pulling it this way and that, like two dogs growling  over a bone, Pa described it this time--and then the newcomer won and  carried us off. The Sun got a consolation prize, though. At the last  minute he managed to hold on to the Moon.    That was the time of the monster earthquakes and floods, twenty times  worse than anything before. It was also the time of the Big Jerk, as Pa  calls it, when all Earth got yanked suddenly, just as Pa has done to  me once or twice, grabbing me by the collar to do it, when I've been  sitting too far from the fire.    You see, the dark star was going through space faster than the Sun, and  in the opposite direction, and it had to wrench the world considerably  in order to take it away.    The Big Jerk didn't last long. It was over as soon as the Earth  was settled down in its new orbit around the dark star. But it was  pretty terrible while it lasted. Pa says that all sorts of cliffs and  buildings toppled, oceans slopped over, swamps and sandy deserts gave  great sliding surges that buried nearby lands. Earth was almost jerked  out of its atmosphere blanket and the air got so thin in spots that  people keeled over and fainted--though of course, at the same time,  they were getting knocked down by the Big Jerk and maybe their bones  broke or skulls cracked.    We've often asked Pa how people acted during that time, whether they  were scared or brave or crazy or stunned, or all four, but he's sort of  leery of the subject, and he was again tonight. He says he was mostly  too busy to notice.    You see, Pa and some scientist friends of his had figured out part of  what was going to happen--they'd known we'd get captured and our air  would freeze--and they'd been working like mad to fix up a place with  airtight walls and doors, and insulation against the cold, and big  supplies of food and fuel and water and bottled air. But the place  got smashed in the last earthquakes and all Pa's friends were killed  then and in the Big Jerk. So he had to start over and throw the Nest  together quick without any advantages, just using any stuff he could  lay his hands on.    I guess he's telling pretty much the truth when he says he didn't have  any time to keep an eye on how other folks behaved, either then or  in the Big Freeze that followed--followed very quick, you know, both  because the dark star was pulling us away very fast and because Earth's  rotation had been slowed in the tug-of-war, so that the nights were ten  old nights long.    Still, I've got an idea of some of the things that happened from the  frozen folk I've seen, a few of them in other rooms in our building,  others clustered around the furnaces in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51547"],[0,"The Story of the Airship (Non-rigid) (#2)"],[1,"weeks in our coastal waters, used the  rest of the time getting over and back.    But in those few weeks these six submarines destroyed exactly 100 ships,  of all sizes, types and registry, killed 435 people. Most of the ships  were peaceful unarmed merchantmen, coastwise ships from the West Indies  and South America, tankers from Galveston, fishing ships heading back  from the Grand Banks, supply ships carrying guns and war materials to  England, a few stragglers from convoys.    The subs' biggest catch was the USS San Diego, a cruiser, sunk by mine  off Fire Island, just outside New York harbor, July 19, 1918, with 1,180  officers and men aboard. Only six lives, fortunately, were lost. The  battleship Minnesota, escorted by a destroyer, struck a mine off Fenwick  shoals light ship, early in the morning of September 29, but made  temporary repairs and limped back into Philadelphia Navy Yard 18 hours  later. A fragment of the mine was found imbedded in her frame work.        [Illustration: Reproduced from U.S. Navy map showing track of      submarines operating in American waters during last few months of      first World War.]    Mines were laid at strategic points. One field, with its mines 500 to  1,000 yards apart was laid off Cape Hatteras, one at the mouth of  Chesapeake Bay, one across Delaware Bay, two in between these key  inlets, another off Barnegat, and the last off Fire Island. Some of the  mines drifted ashore, others were found and destroyed--the last ones not  till the following January. But mines accounted for six of the ships  lost.    One of the submarines, the U-117, built as a mine layer, planted 46 of  the 58 mines laid along our shores; four others were merchant subs of  the Deutschland type, including the Deutschland itself, which had twice  previously visited this country on ostensibly friendly missions.    Though the subs encountered a few victims on the way over or back, most  of the ships were destroyed in the shallower waters within 200 miles of  the American and Canadian coast. The fishing was better close in.    Naval Intelligence knew, through Admiral Sims' office in London, just  when each submarine left Kiel, what its probable destination was, and  its approximate arrival date. The Navy could not broadcast this  information, lest U-boat captains learn they were expected, but took  appropriate defense measures. Even so, each submarine traveled directly  to its destination, carried out its mission.    U-boats operated almost with immunity from Newfoundland to the Virginia  capes. Twice American men of war passed over submerging craft so close  as almost to ram them. The U-151 worked at cutting cables for three  days, near enough to New York City that the crew could see the lights of  Broadway at night. The U-115, lying off the Virginia capes, came to the  surface one afternoon just in time for its periscope to disclose a  cruiser, two destroyers and a Navy tug a mile away, peacefully returning  from routine target practice, entirely unaware that the U-boat was  lurking in the vicinity.    The submarines got a poor press that summer, not only for reasons of  military secrecy, but because more stirring news held the attention of  the public. The AEF was beginning to see action in France.    Still headlines flashed occasionally as censorship was raised, or  survivors brought in stories. From the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin  during this period:    \"Hun U-boats Raid New Jersey coast--Schooner Edward H. Cole Attacked by  two Submarines, Destroyed--Two Attacked Off New England--Atlantic Ports  Closed\"--and the story, under New York date line: \"Germany has carried  her unrestricted submarine warfare to this side of the ocean--at least  five vessels sunk--submarine chasers ordered out from Cape May--Coast  Guard stations on special lookout--marine insurance companies announce  sharp increase in rates.\"    News Flash--\"Wireless report from passenger steamer Carolina says she is  under attack\"--The Carolina is sunk, 300 survivors are landed at  Barnegat Bay, 19 at Lewes Del., 30 at Atlantic City, others picked up in  open boats.        [Illustration: On this map of actual ship sinkings and mine layings      in 1918 is superimposed a sketch of the area which a handful of      modern patrol blimps might cover.]    Then: \"Navy mine sweepers sent out to destroy mines and floating  torpedoes which had missed target--tanker Herbert L. Pratt strikes mine  in shallow water on maiden voyage--War Department asks Congress for  $10,000,000 to set up balloon and plane stations along the coast to  combat sub menace--British steamer Harpathian torpedoed off Virginia  capes--American vessel, name withheld, puts back to 'an Atlantic port'  after being chased by U-boat.\"    The record continues: \"San Diego sunk by mine--tug and four barges  sunk--British freighter attacked--sub sends landing crew on board lumber  schooner off Maine coast, set her afire--Steamer Merak sunk off  Hatteras--tanker torpedoed off Barnegat Bay, beaches blanketed with  oil--Norwegian steamer Vinland--British steamer Peniston and Swedish  steamer Sydland off Nantucket--nine U. S. fishing vessels off  Massachusetts coast--British tanker Mirlo--U.S. Schooner Dorothy  Barrett--tanker Frederick R. Kellogg\" and so on and on.    Events of the time and since have swept these happenings out of the  minds of most Americans--even if they knew of it at the time. But  somewhere, half forgotten in Naval files, is an official report,  painstakingly compiled after the war, from ship logs, from stories by  merchant captains and crews, even by officers of surrendered German  submarines, to make up as complete a record as possible of one of the  amazing operations of the war--and one whose magnitude, in territory  covered and damage done, few suspected, even within the Navy, at the  time.    Only two subs had so much as a brush with American ships. The transport  von Steuben, former German liner, proceeding to the rescue of men in  life boats from a merchant ship, dropped depth bombs which the U-boat  escaped by diving to 83 meters, lying low till the enemy had gone.    Closer call had the U-140, largest and most modern of the fleet, which  after sinking several ships off Diamond Shoals, including the light ship  itself, almost caught a tartar when the Brazilian passenger liner,  Uberabe, zigzagging furiously to escape, sent out S.O.S. messages which  brought four U.S. destroyers hurrying to the rescue. Nearest was the USS  Stringham, which proceeding under full speed, using the Uberabe as a  screen, charged on the U-boat, dropped 15 depth charges when the U-boat  dived, timed to explode at different levels.        [Illustration: Training exercises with U. S. submarines have taught      airship captains much about the habits, movements and      characteristics of the underseas craft. (U. S. Navy photo).]        [Illustration: The year before America got into the last war the      German submarine U-51 sank a half dozen merchant ships off Nantucket      Island then proceeded into Newport. (U. S. Navy photo)]        [Illustration: Navy airships in practice patrols identify, as to      class and nationality, all surface ships in their area, learn to      recognize the silhouette of a submarine from afar. (U. S. Navy      photo)]    The U-boat captain, one of the best in the German navy, drove his craft  at a sharp angle to 400 feet. One charge exploding underneath the sub  turned it stern upward till it stood almost perpendicular. He managed to  level out finally at 415 feet, lay there as long as he dared, finally  reached the surface. His ship was so badly crippled it had to abandon  its mission and set out for home--though it sunk a couple more ships in  the mid-Atlantic on the way back.    The only U-boat casualty was the U-156 which after getting 34 victims in  American waters, getting eight in one day, was itself sunk by mines--but  off Faroe Island as it was almost home.    This then is the story of submarine operations in U. S. waters in  1918--a half hearted effort of short duration started late in the  day--but which destroyed 100 ships, totalling 200,000 tons, most of them  close to our shores.    No one could doubt but that in the event of another war submarines would  be used again, and in more vigorous fashion. The American fleet might  easily keep major enemy ships at a safe distance, and bombing attack  from any part of Europe or over the Pacific would have little military  value. But certainly submarines would find their way past the screen of  Navy craft, bob up off American harbors, again to lay mines in the path  of coastwise steamers, deliver hit-and-run attack by torpedo and gunfire  at American craft.    We could be equally sure that these ugly motorized sharks, churning the  muddy sub-surface waters, would not be satisfied to attack merchantmen  only, would be looking for bigger prey.    On the map showing the operations of German submarines in 1918 let us  superimpose, as an example, the patrol area which two blimps, basing at  Boston, Lakehurst, Cape May and Norfolk might effectively cover in a 12  hour period.    A patrol area of 2,000 square miles per ship is conservative. It assumes  the ship flying at no faster than 35 knots, having visibility of five  miles in all directions. As a matter of fact, allowing a little more  than 40 knots speed--and the airship cruises considerably faster than  that--we might say that a modern blimp could patrol an area 10 miles  wide and 500 miles long in the 12 hours, or an area of 5,000 square  miles. But by criss-crossing back and forth in accordance with a  progressive plan, an area of 2,000 square miles could be made reasonably  secure--except under extremely adverse conditions of visibility.    Laying these patrol areas down over the map of submarine operations of  1918 it is apparent that such patrols would cover much of the territory  where ship sinkings were achieved, cover"]]]
