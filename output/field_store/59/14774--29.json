Yet sometimes comes a ruffing cloud to make  The quiet surface of the ocean shake;  As an awaken'd giant with a frown  Might show his wrath, and then to sleep sink down.     View now the Winter-storm! above, one cloud,  Black and unbroken, all the skies o'ershroud:  Th' unwieldy porpoise through the day before  Had roll'd in view of boding men on shore;  And sometimes hid and sometimes show'd his form,  Dark as the cloud, and furious as the storm.     All where the eye delights, yet dreads to roam,  The breaking billows cast the flying foam  Upon the billows rising--all the deep  Is restless change; the waves so swell'd and steep,  Breaking and sinking, and the sunken swells,  Nor one, one moment, in its station dwells:  But nearer land you may the billows trace,  As if contending in their watery chase;  May watch the mightiest till the shoal they reach,  Then break and hurry to their utmost stretch;  Curl'd as they come, they strike with furious force,  And then re-flowing, take their grating course,  Raking the rounded flints, which ages past  Roll'd by their rage, and shall to ages last.     Far off the Petrel in the troubled way  Swims with her brood, or flutters in the spray;  She rises often, often drops again,  And sports at ease on the tempestuous main.     High o'er the restless deep, above the reach  Of gunner's hope, vast flights of Wild-ducks stretch;  Far as the eye can glance on either side,  In a broad space and level line they glide;  All in their wedge-like figures from the north,  Day after day, flight after flight, go forth.     In-shore their passage tribes of Sea-gulls urge,  And drop for prey within the sweeping surge;  Oft in the rough opposing blast they fly  Far back, then turn, and all their force apply,  While to the storm they give their weak complaining cry;  Or clap the sleek white pinion to the breast,  And in the restless ocean dip for rest.     Darkness begins to reign; the louder wind  Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind;  But frights not him whom evening and the spray  In part conceal--yon Prowler on his way:  Lo! he has something seen; he runs apace,  As if he fear'd companion in the chase;  He sees his prize, and now he turns again,  Slowly and sorrowing--\"Was your search in vain?\"  Gruffly he answers, \"'Tis a sorry sight!  A seaman's body:  there'll be more to-night!\"     Hark! to those sounds! they're from distress at sea;  How quick they come! What terrors may there be!  Yes, 'tis a driven vessel:  I discern  Lights, signs of terror, gleaming from the stern;  Others behold them too, and from the town  In various parties seamen hurry down;  Their wives pursue, and damsels urged by dread,  Lest men so dear be into danger led;  Their head the gown has hooded, and their call  In this sad night is piercing like the squall;  They feel their kinds of power, and when they meet,  Chide, fondle, weep, dare, threaten, or entreat.     See one poor girl, all terror and alarm,  Has fondly seized upon her lover's arm;  \"Thou shalt not venture;\" and he answers \"No!  I will not:\"--still she cries, \"Thou shalt not go.\"     No need of this; not here the stoutest boat  Can through such breakers, o'er such billows float,  Yet may they view these lights upon the beach,  Which yield them hope whom help can never reach.     From parted clouds the moon her radiance throws  On the wild waves, and all the danger shows;  But shows them beaming in her shining vest,  Terrific splendour! gloom in glory dress'd!  This for a moment, and then clouds again  Hide every beam, and fear and darkness reign.     But hear we not those sounds?  Do lights appear?  I see them not! the storm alone I hear:  And lo! the sailors homeward take their way;  Man must endure--let us submit and pray.     Such are our Winter-views:  but night comes on -  Now business sleeps, and daily cares are gone;  Now parties form, and some their friends assist  To waste the idle hours at sober whist;  The tavern's pleasure or the concert's charm  Unnumber'd moments of their sting disarm:  Play-bills and open doors a crowd invite,  To pass off one dread portion of the night;  And show and song and luxury combined,  Lift off from man this burthen of mankind.     Others advent'rous walk abroad and meet  Returning parties pacing through the street,  When various voices, in the dying day,  Hum in our walks, and greet us in our way;  When tavern-lights flit on from room to room,  And guide the tippling sailor staggering home:  There as we pass, the jingling bells betray  How business rises with the closing day:  Now walking silent, by the river's side,  The ear perceives the rippling of the tide;  Or measured cadence of the lads who tow  Some entered hoy, to fix her in her row;  Or hollow sound, which from the parish-bell  To some departed spirit bids farewell!     Thus shall you something of our BOROUGH know,  Far as a verse, with Fancy's aid, can show.  Of Sea or River, of a Quay or Street,  The best description must be incomplete;  But when a happier theme succeeds, and when  Men are our subjects and the deeds of men,  Then may we find the Muse in happier style,  And we may sometimes sigh and sometimes smile.

The old Foundation--but it is not clear  When it was laid--you care not for the year;  On this, as parts decayed by time and storms,  Arose these various disproportion'd forms;  Yet Gothic all--the learn'd who visit us  (And our small wonders) have decided thus:-  \"Yon noble Gothic arch,\" \"That Gothic door;\"  So have they said; of proof you'll need no more.     Here large plain columns rise in solemn style,  You'd love the gloom they make in either aisle;  When the sun's rays, enfeebled as they pass  (And shorn of splendour) through the storied glass,  Faintly display the figures on the floor,  Which pleased distinctly in their place before.     But ere you enter, yon bold tower survey,  Tall and entire, and venerably gray,  For time has soften'd what was harsh when new,  And now the stains are all of sober hue;  The living stains which Nature's hand alone,  Profuse of life, pours forth upon the stone:  For ever growing; where the common eye  Can but the bare and rocky bed descry;  There Science loves to trace her tribes minute,  The juiceless foliage, and the tasteless fruit;  There she perceives them round the surface creep,  And while they meet their due distinction keep;  Mix'd but not blended; each its name retains,  And these are Nature's ever-during stains.     And wouldst thou, Artist! with thy tints and brush,  Form shades like these?  Pretender, where thy blush?  In three short hours shall thy presuming hand  Th' effect of three slow centuries command?  Thou may'st thy various greens and grays contrive;  They are not Lichens, nor like ought alive;-  But yet proceed, and when thy tints are lost,  Fled in the shower, or crumbled by the frost;  When all thy work is done away as clean  As if thou never spread'st thy gray and green;  Then may'st thou see how Nature's work is done,  How slowly true she lays her colours on;  When her least speck upon the hardest flint  Has mark and form, and is a living tint;  And so embodied with the rock, that few  Can the small germ upon the substance view.     Seeds, to our eyes invisible, will find  On the rude rock the bed that fits their kind;  There, in the rugged soil, they safely dwell,  Till showers and snows the subtle atoms swell,  And spread th' enduring foliage;--then we trace  The freckled flower upon the flinty base;  These all increase, till in unnoticed years  The stony tower as gray with age appears;  With coats of vegetation, thinly spread,  Coat above coat, the living on the dead;  These then dissolve to dust, and make a way  For bolder foliage, nursed by their decay:  The long-enduring Ferns in time will all  Die and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#2)"],[1,"the work was to amuse but, in amusing,  he also intended to pillory the aristocracy and his wit is as keen as the  point of a rapier; but, when we bear in mind the fact that he was an  ancient, we will find that his cynicism is not cruel, in him there is  none of the malignity of Aristophanes; there is rather the attitude of  the refined patrician who is always under the necessity of facing those  things which he holds most in contempt, the supreme artist who suffers  from the multitude of bill-boards, so to speak, who lashes the posters  but holds in pitying contempt those who know so little of true art that  they mistake those posters for the genuine article.  Niebuhr's estimate  of his character is so just and free from prejudice, and proceeds from  a mind which, in itself, was so pure and wholesome, that I will quote it:    \"All great dramatic poets are endowed with the power of creating beings  who seem to act and speak with perfect independence, so that the poet is  nothing more than the relator of what takes place.  When Goethe had  conceived Faust and Margarete, Mephistopheles and Wagner, they moved and  had their being without any exercise of his will.  But in the peculiar  power which Petronius exercises, in its application to every scene, to  every individual character, in everything, noble or mean, which he  undertakes, I know of but one who is fully equal to the Roman, and that  is Diderot.  Trimalchio and Agamemnon might have spoken for Petronius,  and the nephew Rameau and the parson Papin for Diderot, in every  condition and on every occasion inexhaustibly, out of their own nature;  just so the purest and noblest souls, whose kind was, after all, not  entirely extinct in their day.    \"Diderot and a contemporary, related to him in spirit, Count Gaspar  Gozzi, are marked with the same cynicism which disfigures the Roman;  their age, like his, had become shameless.  But as the two former were in  their heart noble, upright, and benevolent men, and as in the writings of  Diderot genuine virtue and a tenderness unknown to his contemporaries  breathe, so the peculiarity of such a genius can, as it seems, be given  to a noble and elevated being only.  The deep contempt for prevailing  immorality which naturally leads to cynicism, and a heart which beats for  everything great and glorious,--virtues which then had no existence,  --speak from the pages of the Roman in a language intelligible to every  susceptible heart.\"      e--Beck, in his paper, \"The Age of Petronius Arbiter,\" concluded that the  author lived and wrote between the years 6 A.D.  and 34 A.D., but he  overlooked the possibility that the author might have lived a few years  later, written of conditions as they were in his own times, and yet laid  the action of his novel a few years before.  Mommsen and Haley place the  time under Augustus, Buecheler, about 36-7 A.D., and Friedlaender under  Nero.      d--La Porte du Theil places the scene at Naples because of the fact the  city in which our heroes met Agamemnon must have been of some  considerable size because neither Encolpius nor Asclytos could find their  way back to their inn, when once they had left it, because both were  tired out from tramping around in search of it and because Giton had been  so impressed with this danger that he took the precaution to mark the  pillars with chalk in order that they might not be lost a second time.  The Gulf of Naples is the only bit of coastline which fits the needs of  the novel, hence the city must be Naples.  The fact that neither of the  characters knew the city proves that they had been recent arrivals, and  this furnishes a clue, vague though it is, to what may have gone before.    Haley, \"Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,\" vol. II, makes out a  very strong case for Puteoli, and his theory of the old town and the new  town is as ingenious as it is able.  Haley also has Trimalchio in his  favor, as has also La Porte du Theil.  \"I saw the Sibyl at Cumae,\" says  Trimalchio.  Now if the scene of the dinner is actually at Cumae this  sounds very peculiar; it might even be a gloss added by some copyist  whose knowledge was not equal to his industry.  On the other hand,  suppose Trimalchio is speaking of something so commonplace in his  locality that the second term has become a generic, then the difficulty  disappears.  We today, even though standing upon the very spot in Melos  where the Venus was unearthed, would still refer to her as the Venus de  Melos.  Friedlaender, in bracketing Cumis, has not taken this  sufficiently into consideration.  Mommsen, in an excellent paper (Hermes,  1878), has laid the scene at Cumae.  His logic is almost unanswerable,  and the consensus of opinion is in favor of the latter town.        III    REALISM.  Realism, as we are concerned with it, may be defined as the  literary effect produced by the marshaling of details in their exactitude  for the purpose of bringing out character.  The fact that they may be  ugly and vulgar the reverse, makes not the slightest difference.  The  modern realist contemplates the inanimate things which surround us with  peculiar complaisance, and it is right that he should as these things  exert upon us a constant and secret influence.  The workings of the human  mind, in complex civilizations, are by no means simple; they are involved  and varied: our thoughts, our feelings, our wills, associate themselves  with an infinite number of sensations and images which play one upon the  other, and which individualize, in some measure, every action we commit,  and stamp it.  The merit of our modern realists lies in the fact that  they have studied the things which surround us and our relations to them,  and thus have they been able to make their creations conform to human  experience.  The ancients gave little attention to this; the man, with  them, was the important thing; the environment the unimportant.  There  are, of course, exceptions; the interview between Ulysses and Nausiskaa  is probably the most striking.  From the standpoint of environment,  Petronius, in the greater portion of his work, is an ancient; but one  exception there is, and it is as brilliant as it is important.  The  entire episode, in which Trimalchio figures, offers an incredible  abundance of details.  The descriptions are exhaustive and minute, but  the author's prime purpose was not description, it was to bring out the  characters, it was to pillory the Roman aristocracy, it was to amuse!  Cicero, in his prosecution of Verres, had shown up this aristocracy in  all its brutality and greed, it remained for the author of the Cena to  hold its absurdity up to the light of day, to lash an extravagance which,  though utterly unbridled, was yet unable to exhaust the looted  accumulations of years of political double dealing and malfeasance in  office.  Trimalchio's introduction is a masterstroke, the porter at the  door is another, the effect of the wine upon the women, their jealousy  lest either's husband should seem more liberal, their appraisal of each  other's jewelry, Scintilla's remark anent the finesse of Habinnas'  servant in the mere matter of pandering, the blear-eyed and black-toothed  slave, teasing a little bitch disgustingly fat, offering her pieces of  bread and when, from sheer inability, she refuses to eat, cramming it  down her throat, the effect of the alcohol upon Trimalchio, the little  old lady girded round with a filthy apron, wearing clogs which were not  mates, dragging in a huge dog on a chain, the incomparable humor in the  passage in which Hesus, desperately seasick, sees that which makes him  believe that even worse misfortunes are in store for him: these details  are masterpieces of realism.  The description of the night-prowling  shyster lawyer, whose forehead is covered with sebaceous wens, is the  very acme of propriety; our first meeting; with the poet Eumolpus is a  beautiful study in background and perspective.  Nineteen centuries have  gone their way since this novel was written, but if we look about us we  will be able to recognize, under the veneer of civilization, the  originals of the Satyricon and we will find that here, in a little corner  of the Roman world, all humanity was held in miniature.  Petronius must  be credited with the great merit of having introduced realism into the  novel.  By an inspiration of genius, he saw that the framework of  frivolous and licentious novels could be enlarged until it took in  contemporary custom and environment.  It is that which assures for him  an eminent place, not in Roman literature alone, but in the literature  of the world.    a--INFLUENCE OF THE SATYRICON UPON LITERATURE.  The vagrant heroes of  Petronius are the originals from whom directly, or indirectly, later  authors drew that inspiration which resulted in the great mass of  picaresque fiction; but, great as this is, it is not to this that the  Satyricon owes its powerful influence upon the literature of the world.  It is to the author's recognition of the importance of environment,  of the vital role of inanimate surroundings as a means for bringing out  character and imbuing his episodes and the actions of his characters with  an air of reality and with those impulses and actions which are common to  human experience, that his influence is due.  By this, the Roman created  a new style of writing and inaugurated a class of literature which was  without parallel until the time of Apuleius and, in a lesser degree, of  Lucian.  This class of literature, though modified essentially from age  to age, in keeping with the dictates of moral purity or bigotry, innocent  or otherwise, has come to be the very stuff of which literary success in  fiction is made.  One may write a successful book without a thread of  romance; one cannot write a successful romance without some knowledge of  realism; the more intimate the knowledge the better the book, and it is  frequently to"]]]
