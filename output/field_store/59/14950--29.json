I have  also given reasons that lead me to the conclusion that, despite its  dominance, the function of sexual maturity and procreative power is  peculiarly mobile up and down the age-line independently of many of  the qualities usually so closely associated with it, so that much that  sex created in the phylum now precedes it in the individual.    Rousseau would leave prepubescent years to nature and to these primal  hereditary impulsions and allow the fundamental traits of savagery  their fling till twelve. Biological psychology finds many and cogent  reasons to confirm this view _if only a proper environment could be  provided_. The child revels in savagery; and if its tribal, predatory,  hunting, fishing, fighting, roving, idle, playing proclivities could  be indulged in the country and under conditions that now, alas! seem  hopelessly ideal, they could conceivably be so organized and directed  as to be far more truly humanistic and liberal than all that the best  modern school can provide. Rudimentary organs of the soul, now  suppressed, perverted, or delayed, to crop out in menacing forms  later, would be developed in their season so that we should be immune  to them in maturer years, on the principle of the Aristotelian  catharsis for which I have tried to suggest a far broader application  than the Stagirite could see in his day.    These inborn and more or less savage instincts can and should be  allowed some scope. The deep and strong cravings in the individual for  those primitive experiences and occupations in which his ancestors  became skilful through the pressure of necessity should not be  ignored, but can and should be, at least partially, satisfied in a  vicarious way, by tales from literature, history, and tradition which  present the crude and primitive virtues of the heroes of the world's  childhood. In this way, aided by his vivid visual imagination, the  child may enter upon his heritage from the past, live out each stage  of life to its fullest and realize in himself all its manifold  tendencies. Echoes only of the vaster, richer life of the remote past  of the race they must remain, but just these are the murmurings of the  only muse that can save from the omnipresent dangers of precocity.  Thus we not only rescue from the danger of loss, but utilize for  further psychic growth the results of the higher heredity, which are  the most precious and potential things on earth. So, too, in our  urbanized hothouse life, that tends to ripen everything before its  time, we must teach nature, although the very phrase is ominous. But  we must not, in so doing, wean still more from, but perpetually incite  to visit, field, forest, hill, shore, the water, flowers, animals, the  true homes of childhood in this wild, undomesticated stage from which  modern conditions have kidnapped and transported him. Books and  reading are distasteful, for the very soul and body cry out for a more  active, objective life, and to know nature and man at first hand.  These two staples, stories and nature, by these informal methods of  the home and the environment, constitute fundamental education.    But now another remove from nature seems to be made necessary by the  manifold knowledges and skills of our highly complex civilization. We  should transplant the human sapling, I concede reluctantly, as early  as eight, but not before, to the schoolhouse with its imperfect  lighting, ventilation, temperature. We must shut out nature and open  books. The child must sit on unhygienic benches and work the tiny  muscles that wag the tongue and pen, and let all the others, which  constitute nearly half its weight, decay. Even if it be prematurely,  he must be subjected to special disciplines and be apprenticed to the  higher qualities of adulthood; for he is not only a product of nature,  but a candidate for a highly developed humanity. To many, if not most,  of the influences here there can be at first but little inner  response. Insight, understanding, interest, sentiment, are for the  most part only nascent; and most that pertains to the true kingdom of  mature manhood is embryonic. The wisest requirements seem to the child  more or less alien, arbitrary, heteronomous, artificial, falsetto.  There is much passivity, often active resistance and evasion, and  perhaps spasms of obstinacy, to it all. But the senses are keen and  alert, reactions immediate and vigorous; and the memory is quick, sure  and lasting; and ideas of space, time, and physical causation, and of  many a moral and social licit and non-licit, are rapidly unfolding.  Never again will there be such susceptibility to drill and discipline,  such plasticity to habituation, or such ready adjustment to new  conditions. It is the age of external and mechanical training.  Reading, writing, drawing, manual training, musical technic, foreign  tongues and their pronunciations, the manipulation of numbers and of  geometrical elements, and many kinds of skill have now their golden  hour; and if it passes unimproved, all these can never be acquired  later without a heavy handicap of disadvantage and loss. These  necessities may be hard for the health of body, sense, mind, as well  as for morals; and pedagogic art consists in breaking the child into  them betimes as intensely and as quickly as possible with minimal  strain and with the least amount of explanation or coquetting for  natural interest, and in calling medicine confectionery. This is not  teaching in its true sense so much as it is drill, inculcation, and  regimentation. The method should be mechanical, repetitive,  authoritative, dogmatic. The automatic powers are now at their very  apex, and they can do and bear more than our degenerate pedagogy knows  or dreams of. Here we have something to learn from the schoolmasters  of the past back to the middle ages, and even from the ancients. The  greatest stress, with short periods and few hours, incessant  insistence, incitement, and little reliance upon interest, reason or  work done without the presence of the teacher, should be the guiding  principles for pressure in these essentially formal and, to the child,  contentless elements of knowledge. These should be sharply  distinguished from the indigenous, evoking, and more truly educational  factors described in the last paragraph, which are meaty,  content-full, and relatively formless as to time of day, method,  spirit, and perhaps environment and personnel of teacher, and possibly  somewhat in season of the year, almost as sharply as work differs from  play, or perhaps as the virility of man that loves to command a  phalanx, be a martinet and drill-master, differs from femininity which  excels in persuasion, sympathetic insight, story-telling, and in the  tact that discerns and utilizes spontaneous interests in the young.    Adolescence is a new birth, for the higher and more completely human  traits are now born. The qualities of body and soul that now emerge  are far newer. The child comes from and harks back to a remoter past;  the adolescent is neo-atavistic, and in him the later acquisitions of  the race slowly become prepotent. Development is less gradual and more  saltatory, suggestive of some ancient period of storm and stress when  old moorings were broken and a higher level attained. The annual rate  of growth in height, weight, and strength is increased and often  doubled, and even more. Important functions, previously non-existent,  arise. Growth of parts and organs loses its former proportions, some  permanently and some for a season. Some of these are still growing in  old age and others are soon arrested and atrophy. The old measures of  dimensions become obsolete, and old harmonies are broken. The range of  individual differences and average errors in all physical measurements  and all psychic tests increases. Some linger long in the childish  stage and advance late or slowly, while others push on with a sudden  outburst of impulsion to early maturity. Bones and muscles lead all  other tissues, as if they vied with each other; and there is frequent  flabbiness or tension as one or the other leads. Nature arms youth for  conflict with all the resources at her command--speed, power of  shoulder, biceps, back, leg, jaw--strengthens and enlarges skull,  thorax, hips, makes man aggressive and prepares woman's frame for  maternity.           *     *     *     *     *          CHAPTER II      THE MUSCLES AND MOTOR POWERS IN GENERAL      Muscles as organs of the will, of character and even of thought--The  muscular virtues--Fundamental and accessory muscles and functions--The  development of the mind and of the upright position--Small  muscles as organs of thought--School lays too much stress upon  these--Chorea--vast numbers of automatic movements in children--Great  variety of spontaneous activities--Poise, control and spurtiness--Pen  and tongue wagging--Sedentary school life _vs_ free out-of-door  activities--Modern decay of muscles, especially in girls--Plasticity  of motor habits at puberty.    The muscles are by weight about forty-three per cent. of the average  adult male human body. They expend a large fraction of all the kinetic  energy of the adult body, which a recent estimate places as high as  one-fifth. The cortical centers for the voluntary muscles extend over  most of the lateral psychic zones of the brain, so that their culture  is brain building. In a sense they are organs of digestion, for which  function they play a very important role. Muscles are in a most  intimate and peculiar sense the organs of the will. They have built  all the roads, cities, and machines in the world, written all the  books, spoken all the words, and, in fact, done everything that man  has accomplished with matter. If they are undeveloped or grow relaxed  and flabby, the dreadful chasm between good intentions and their  execution is liable to appear and widen.

She would bring a great price farther north, if we found it too  difficult to collect ransom money from this Tarzan.\"    Werper bent his head in thought.  Achmet Zek stood awaiting his reply.  What good remained in Albert Werper revolted at the thought of selling  a white woman into the slavery and degradation of a Moslem harem.  He  looked up at Achmet Zek.  He saw the Arab's eyes narrow, and he guessed  that the other had sensed his antagonism to the plan.  What would it  mean to Werper to refuse?  His life lay in the hands of this  semi-barbarian,  who esteemed the life of an unbeliever less highly  than that of a dog.  Werper loved life.  What was this woman to him,  anyway?  She was a European, doubtless, a member of organized society.  He was an outcast.  The hand of every white man was against him.  She  was his natural enemy, and if he refused to lend himself to her  undoing, Achmet Zek would have him killed.    \"You hesitate,\" murmured the Arab.    \"I was but weighing the chances of success,\" lied Werper, \"and my  reward.  As a European I can gain admittance to their home and table.  You have no other with you who could do so much.  The risk will be  great.  I should be well paid, Achmet Zek.\"    A smile of relief passed over the raider's face.    \"Well said, Werper,\" and Achmet Zek slapped his lieutenant upon the  shoulder.  \"You should be well paid and you shall.  Now let us sit  together and plan how best the thing may be done,\" and the two men  squatted upon a soft rug beneath the faded silks of Achmet's once  gorgeous tent, and talked together in low voices well into the night.  Both were tall and bearded, and the exposure to sun and wind had given  an almost Arab hue to the European's complexion.  In every detail of  dress, too, he copied the fashions of his chief, so that outwardly he  was as much an Arab as the other.  It was late when he arose and  retired to his own tent.    The following day Werper spent in overhauling his Belgian uniform,  removing from it every vestige of evidence that might indicate its  military purposes.  From a heterogeneous collection of loot, Achmet Zek  procured a pith helmet and a European saddle, and from his black slaves  and followers a party of porters, askaris and tent boys to make up a  modest safari for a big game hunter.  At the head of this party Werper  set out from camp.          2    On the Road To Opar      It was two weeks later that John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, riding in  from a tour of inspection of his vast African estate, glimpsed the head  of a column of men crossing the plain that lay between his bungalow and  the forest to the north and west.    He reined in his horse and watched the little party as it emerged from  a concealing swale.  His keen eyes caught the reflection of the sun  upon the white helmet of a mounted man, and with the conviction that a  wandering European hunter was seeking his hospitality, he wheeled his  mount and rode slowly forward to meet the newcomer.    A half hour later he was mounting the steps leading to the veranda of  his bungalow, and introducing M. Jules Frecoult to Lady Greystoke.    \"I was completely lost,\" M. Frecoult was explaining.  \"My head man had  never before been in this part of the country and the guides who were  to have accompanied me from the last village we passed knew even less  of the country than we.  They finally deserted us two days since.  I am  very fortunate indeed to have stumbled so providentially upon succor.  I do not know what I should have done, had I not found you.\"    It was decided that Frecoult and his party should remain several days,  or until they were thoroughly rested, when Lord Greystoke would furnish  guides to lead them safely back into country with which Frecoult's head  man was supposedly familiar.    In his guise of a French gentleman of leisure, Werper found little  difficulty in deceiving his host and in ingratiating himself with both  Tarzan and Jane Clayton; but the longer he remained the less hopeful he  became of an easy accomplishment of his designs.    Lady Greystoke never rode alone at any great distance from the  bungalow, and the savage loyalty of the ferocious Waziri warriors who  formed a great part of Tarzan's followers seemed to preclude the  possibility of a successful attempt at forcible abduction, or of the  bribery of the Waziri themselves.    A week passed, and Werper was no nearer the fulfillment of his plan, in  so far as he could judge, than upon the day of his arrival, but at that  very moment something occurred which gave him renewed hope and set his  mind upon an even greater reward than a woman's ransom.    A runner had arrived at the bungalow with the weekly mail, and Lord  Greystoke had spent the afternoon in his study reading and answering  letters.  At dinner he seemed distraught, and early in the evening he  excused himself and retired, Lady Greystoke following him very soon  after.  Werper, sitting upon the veranda, could hear their voices in  earnest discussion, and having realized that something of unusual  moment was afoot, he quietly rose from his chair, and keeping well in  the shadow of the shrubbery growing profusely about the bungalow, made  his silent way to a point beneath the window of the room in which his  host and hostess slept.    Here he listened, and not without result, for almost the first words he  overheard filled him with excitement.  Lady Greystoke was speaking as  Werper came within hearing.    \"I always feared for the stability of the company,\" she was saying;  \"but it seems incredible that they should have failed for so enormous a  sum--unless there has been some dishonest manipulation.\"    \"That is what I suspect,\" replied Tarzan; \"but whatever the cause, the  fact remains that I have lost everything, and there is nothing for it  but to return to Opar and get more.\"    \"Oh, John,\" cried Lady Greystoke, and Werper could feel the shudder  through her voice, \"is there no other way?  I cannot bear to think of  you returning to that frightful city.  I would rather live in poverty  always than to have you risk the hideous dangers of Opar.\"    \"You need have no fear,\" replied Tarzan, laughing.  \"I am pretty well  able to take care of myself, and were I not, the Waziri who will  accompany me will see that no harm befalls me.\"    \"They ran away from Opar once, and left you to your fate,\" she reminded  him.    \"They will not do it again,\" he answered.  \"They were very much ashamed  of themselves, and were coming back when I met them.\"    \"But there must be some other way,\" insisted the woman.    \"There is no other way half so easy to obtain another fortune, as to go  to the treasure vaults of Opar and bring it away,\" he replied.  \"I  shall be very careful, Jane, and the chances are that the inhabitants  of Opar will never know that I have been there again and despoiled them  of another portion of the treasure, the very existence of which they  are as ignorant of as they would be of its value.\"    The finality in his tone seemed to assure Lady Greystoke that further  argument was futile, and so she abandoned the subject.    Werper remained, listening, for a short time, and then, confident that  he had overheard all that was necessary and fearing discovery, returned  to the veranda, where he smoked numerous cigarets in rapid succession  before retiring.    The following morning at breakfast, Werper announced his intention of  making an early departure, and asked Tarzan's permission to hunt big  game in the Waziri country on his way out--permission which Lord  Greystoke readily granted.    The Belgian consumed two days in completing his preparations, but  finally got away with his safari, accompanied by a single Waziri guide  whom Lord Greystoke had loaned him.  The party made but a single short  march when Werper simulated illness, and announced his intention of  remaining where he was until he had fully recovered.  As they had gone  but a short distance from the Greystoke bungalow, Werper dismissed the  Waziri guide, telling the warrior that he would send for him when he  was able to proceed.  The Waziri gone, the Belgian summoned one of  Achmet Zek's trusted blacks to his tent, and dispatched him to watch  for the departure of Tarzan, returning immediately to advise Werper of  the event and the direction taken by the Englishman.    The Belgian did not have long to wait, for the following day his  emissary returned with word that Tarzan and a party of fifty Waziri  warriors had set out toward the southeast early in the morning.    Werper called his head man to him, after writing a long letter to  Achmet Zek.  This letter he handed to the head man.    \"Send a runner at once to Achmet Zek with this,\" he instructed the head  man.  \"Remain here in camp awaiting further instructions from him or  from me.  If any come from the bungalow of the Englishman, tell them  that I am very ill within my tent and can see no one.  Now, give me six  porters and six askaris--the strongest and bravest of the safari--and I  will march after the Englishman and discover where his gold is hidden.\"    And so it was that as Tarzan, stripped to the loin cloth and armed  after the primitive fashion he best loved, led his loyal Waziri toward  the dead city of Opar, Werper, the renegade, haunted his trail through  the long, hot days, and camped close behind him by night.    And as they marched, Achmet Zek rode with his entire following  southward toward the Greystoke farm.    To Tarzan of the Apes the expedition was in the nature of a holiday  outing.  His civilization was at best but an outward veneer which he  gladly peeled off with his uncomfortable European clothes whenever any  reasonable pretext"]]]
