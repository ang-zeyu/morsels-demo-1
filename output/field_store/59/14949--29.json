Its windows were old diamond-pane lattices, its floors were sunken  and uneven, its ceilings blackened by the hand of time, and heavy with  massive beams. Over the doorway was an ancient porch, quaintly and  grotesquely carved; and here on summer evenings the more favoured  customers smoked and drank--ay, and sang many a good song too,  sometimes--reposing on two grim-looking high-backed settles, which,  like the twin dragons of some fairy tale, guarded the entrance to the  mansion.    In the chimneys of the disused rooms, swallows had built their nests  for many a long year, and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole  colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves. There were more  pigeons about the dreary stable-yard and out-buildings than anybody  but the landlord could reckon up. The wheeling and circling flights  of runts, fantails, tumblers, and pouters, were perhaps not quite  consistent with the grave and sober character of the building, but the  monotonous cooing, which never ceased to be raised by some among them  all day long, suited it exactly, and seemed to lull it to rest. With its  overhanging stories, drowsy little panes of glass, and front bulging  out and projecting over the pathway, the old house looked as if it were  nodding in its sleep. Indeed, it needed no very great stretch of fancy  to detect in it other resemblances to humanity. The bricks of which it  was built had originally been a deep dark red, but had grown yellow and  discoloured like an old man's skin; the sturdy timbers had decayed like  teeth; and here and there the ivy, like a warm garment to comfort it in  its age, wrapt its green leaves closely round the time-worn walls.    It was a hale and hearty age though, still: and in the summer or  autumn evenings, when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and  chestnut trees of the adjacent forest, the old house, partaking of its  lustre, seemed their fit companion, and to have many good years of life  in him yet.    The evening with which we have to do, was neither a summer nor an autumn  one, but the twilight of a day in March, when the wind howled dismally  among the bare branches of the trees, and rumbling in the wide chimneys  and driving the rain against the windows of the Maypole Inn, gave such  of its frequenters as chanced to be there at the moment an undeniable  reason for prolonging their stay, and caused the landlord to prophesy  that the night would certainly clear at eleven o'clock precisely,--which  by a remarkable coincidence was the hour at which he always closed his  house.    The name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy thus descended was  John Willet, a burly, large-headed man with a fat face, which betokened  profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehension, combined with a very  strong reliance upon his own merits. It was John Willet's ordinary  boast in his more placid moods that if he were slow he was sure; which  assertion could, in one sense at least, be by no means gainsaid, seeing  that he was in everything unquestionably the reverse of fast, and withal  one of the most dogged and positive fellows in existence--always sure  that what he thought or said or did was right, and holding it as a thing  quite settled and ordained by the laws of nature and Providence, that  anybody who said or did or thought otherwise must be inevitably and of  necessity wrong.    Mr Willet walked slowly up to the window, flattened his fat nose  against the cold glass, and shading his eyes that his sight might not  be affected by the ruddy glow of the fire, looked abroad. Then he  walked slowly back to his old seat in the chimney-corner, and, composing  himself in it with a slight shiver, such as a man might give way to and  so acquire an additional relish for the warm blaze, said, looking round  upon his guests:    'It'll clear at eleven o'clock. No sooner and no later. Not before and  not arterwards.'    'How do you make out that?' said a little man in the opposite corner.  'The moon is past the full, and she rises at nine.'    John looked sedately and solemnly at his questioner until he had brought  his mind to bear upon the whole of his observation, and then made  answer, in a tone which seemed to imply that the moon was peculiarly his  business and nobody else's:    'Never you mind about the moon. Don't you trouble yourself about her.  You let the moon alone, and I'll let you alone.'    'No offence I hope?' said the little man.    Again John waited leisurely until the observation had thoroughly  penetrated to his brain, and then replying, 'No offence as YET,' applied  a light to his pipe and smoked in placid silence; now and then casting  a sidelong look at a man wrapped in a loose riding-coat with huge cuffs  ornamented with tarnished silver lace and large metal buttons, who  sat apart from the regular frequenters of the house, and wearing a hat  flapped over his face, which was still further shaded by the hand on  which his forehead rested, looked unsociable enough.    There was another guest, who sat, booted and spurred, at some distance  from the fire also, and whose thoughts--to judge from his folded  arms and knitted brows, and from the untasted liquor before him--were  occupied with other matters than the topics under discussion or  the persons who discussed them. This was a young man of about  eight-and-twenty, rather above the middle height, and though of somewhat  slight figure, gracefully and strongly made. He wore his own dark hair,  and was accoutred in a riding dress, which together with his large boots  (resembling in shape and fashion those worn by our Life Guardsmen at  the present day), showed indisputable traces of the bad condition of  the roads. But travel-stained though he was, he was well and even richly  attired, and without being overdressed looked a gallant gentleman.    Lying upon the table beside him, as he had carelessly thrown them down,  were a heavy riding-whip and a slouched hat, the latter worn no doubt as  being best suited to the inclemency of the weather. There, too, were a  pair of pistols in a holster-case, and a short riding-cloak. Little of  his face was visible, except the long dark lashes which concealed his  downcast eyes, but an air of careless ease and natural gracefulness  of demeanour pervaded the figure, and seemed to comprehend even those  slight accessories, which were all handsome, and in good keeping.    Towards this young gentleman the eyes of Mr Willet wandered but once,  and then as if in mute inquiry whether he had observed his silent  neighbour. It was plain that John and the young gentleman had often met  before. Finding that his look was not returned, or indeed observed by  the person to whom it was addressed, John gradually concentrated the  whole power of his eyes into one focus, and brought it to bear upon the  man in the flapped hat, at whom he came to stare in course of time with  an intensity so remarkable, that it affected his fireside cronies, who  all, as with one accord, took their pipes from their lips, and stared  with open mouths at the stranger likewise.    The sturdy landlord had a large pair of dull fish-like eyes, and the  little man who had hazarded the remark about the moon (and who was the  parish-clerk and bell-ringer of Chigwell, a village hard by) had little  round black shiny eyes like beads; moreover this little man wore at the  knees of his rusty black breeches, and on his rusty black coat, and  all down his long flapped waistcoat, little queer buttons like nothing  except his eyes; but so like them, that as they twinkled and glistened  in the light of the fire, which shone too in his bright shoe-buckles,  he seemed all eyes from head to foot, and to be gazing with every one of  them at the unknown customer. No wonder that a man should grow restless  under such an inspection as this, to say nothing of the eyes belonging  to short Tom Cobb the general chandler and post-office keeper, and long  Phil Parkes the ranger, both of whom, infected by the example of their  companions, regarded him of the flapped hat no less attentively.    The stranger became restless; perhaps from being exposed to this raking  fire of eyes, perhaps from the nature of his previous meditations--most  probably from the latter cause, for as he changed his position and  looked hastily round, he started to find himself the object of such keen  regard, and darted an angry and suspicious glance at the fireside group.  It had the effect of immediately diverting all eyes to the chimney,  except those of John Willet, who finding himself as it were, caught in  the fact, and not being (as has been already observed) of a very ready  nature, remained staring at his guest in a particularly awkward and  disconcerted manner.    'Well?' said the stranger.    Well. There was not much in well. It was not a long speech. 'I thought  you gave an order,' said the landlord, after a pause of two or three  minutes for consideration.    The stranger took off his hat, and disclosed the hard features of a man  of sixty or thereabouts, much weatherbeaten and worn by time, and  the naturally harsh expression of which was not improved by a dark  handkerchief which was bound tightly round his head, and, while it  served the purpose of a wig, shaded his forehead, and almost hid his  eyebrows. If it were intended to conceal or divert attention from a deep  gash, now healed into an ugly seam, which when it was first inflicted  must have laid bare his cheekbone, the object was but indifferently  attained, for it could scarcely fail to be noted at a glance. His  complexion was of a cadaverous hue, and he had a grizzly jagged beard  of some three weeks' date. Such was the figure (very meanly and poorly  clad) that now rose from the seat, and stalking across the room sat down  in a corner of the chimney, which the politeness or fears of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#2)"],[1,"clinical  standpoint will be discussed later.        § 4. NORMAL ASSOCIATIONAL TENDENCIES      The normal subjects gave, on the average. 6.8 per cent of individual  reactions, 1.5 per cent of doubtful ones, and 91.7 cent of common  ones. The range of variation was rather wide, a considerable number of  subjects giving no individual reactions at all, while a few gave over  30 per cent.[1]    [Footnote 1: In the study of the reactions furnished by our normal  subjects it was possible to analyze the record of any subject only by  removing it from the mass of material which forms our tables, and  using as the standard of comparison the reactions of the remaining 999  subjects.]    In order to determine the influence of age, sex, and education upon  the tendency to give reactions of various values, we have selected  three groups of subjects for special study: (1) one hundred persons of  collegiate or professional education; (2) one hundred persons of  common school education, employed in one of the State hospitals as  attendants, but not as trained nurses; and (3) seventy-eight children  under sixteen years of age. The reactions given by these subjects have  been classified according to frequency of occurrence into seven  groups: (a) individual reactions (value 0); (b) doubtful reactions  (value ±); (c) reactions given by one other person (value 0.1 per  cent); (d) those given by from two to five others (value 0.2--0.5 per  cent); (e) those given by from six to fifteen others (value 0.6-1.5  per cent); (f) those given by from sixteen to one hundred others  (value 1.6--10.0 per cent); and (g) those given by more than one  hundred others (value over 10.0 per cent). The averages obtained from  these groups of subjects are shown in Table 1, and the figures for men  and women are given separately.

Both.1000 6.8 1.5      It will be observed that the proportion of individual reactions given  by the subjects of collegiate education is slightly above the general  average for all subjects, while that of each of the other classes is  below the general average. In view, however, of the wide limits of  variation, among the thousand subjects, these deviations from the  general average are no larger than might quite possibly occur by  chance, and the number of cases in each group is so small that the  conclusion that education tends to increase the number of individual  reactions would hardly be justified.    It will be observed also that this comparative study does not show any  considerable differences corresponding to age or sex.    With regard to the type of reaction, it is possible to select groups  of records which present more or less consistently one of the  following special tendencies: (1) the tendency to react by contrasts;  (2) the tendency to react by synonyms or other defining terms; and (3)  the tendency to react by qualifying or specifying terms. How clearly  the selected groups show these tendencies is indicated by Table  II. The majority of records, however, present no such tendency in a  consistent way; nor is there any evidence to show that these  tendencies, when they occur, are to be regarded as manifestations of  permanent mental characteristics, since they might quite possibly be  due to a more or less accidental and transient associational  direction. No further study has as yet been made of these tendencies,  for the reason that they do not appear to possess any pathological  significance.      TABLE II.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.      This method is so simple that it requires but little training on the  part of the experimenter, and but little co-operation on the part of  the subject. It is not to be assumed that every reaction obtained by  it is a true and immediate association to the corresponding stimulus  word; but we have found it sufficient for the purpose of the test if  the subject can be induced to give, in response to each stimulus word,  any one word other than the stimulus word itself. No attempt is made  to determine the exact degree of co-operation in any case.    In the early stages of this investigation the reaction time was  regularly recorded. The results showed remarkable variations, among  both normal and insane subjects. In a series of twenty-five tests,  made more recently upon normal subjects, ninety reactions occupied  more than ten seconds, and fifty-four of the stimulus words elicited a  ten-second response from at least one subject.[1]    [Footnote 1: These tests were made by Dr. F. Lyman Wells, of the  McLean Hospital, Waverley, Mass., and he has kindly furnished these  data.]    It is noteworthy that these extremely long intervals occur in  connection with reactions of widely differing values. That they are by  no means limited"]]]
