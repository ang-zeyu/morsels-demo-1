The Hudson's Bay Company has always been the guardian angel of the  north.    I suppose that there never yet was another purely commercial concern  that so fully realized the moral obligations of its great power,  or that has so uniformly done its best for the people it ruled.    At all times it has stood for peace, and one hears over and over  again that such and such tribes were deadly enemies, but the Company  insisted on their smoking the peace pipe. The Sioux and Ojibway,  Black-Foot and Assiniboine., Dog-Rib and Copper-Knife, Beaver and  Chipewyan, all offer historic illustrations in point, and many  others could be found for the list.    The name Peace River itself is the monument of a successful effort  on the part of the Company to bring about a better understanding  between the Crees and the Beavers.    Besides human foes, the Company has saved the Indian from famine and  plague. Many a hunger-stricken tribe owes its continued existence  to the fatherly care of the Company, not simply general and  indiscriminate, but minute and personal, carried into the details  of their lives. For instance, when bots so pestered the Caribou of  one region as to render their hides useless to the natives, the  Company brought in hides from a district where they still were  good.    The Chipewyans were each spring the victims of snow-blindness until  the Company brought and succeeded in popularizing their present  ugly but effectual and universal peaked hats. When their train-dogs  were running down in physique, the Company brought in a strain of  pure Huskies or Eskimo. When the Albany River Indians were starving  and unable to hunt, the Company gave the order for 5,000 lodge poles.  Then, not knowing how else to turn them to account, commissioned  the Indians to work them into a picket garden-fence. At all times  the native found a father in the Company, and it was the worst thing  that ever happened the region when the irresponsible free-traders  with their demoralizing methods were allowed to enter and traffic  where or how they pleased.          CHAPTER II    DOWN THE NOISY RIVER WITH THE VOYAGEURS        At Athabaska Landing, on May 18, 1907, 10.15 A. M., we boarded the  superb Peterborough canoe that I had christened the Ann Seton. The  Athabaska River was a-flood and clear of ice; 13 scows of freight,  with 60 half-breeds and Indians to man them, left at the same time,  and in spite of a strong headwind we drifted northward fully 31  miles an hour.    The leading scow, where I spent some time, was in charge of John  MacDonald himself, and his passengers comprised the Hudson's Bay  Company officials, going to their posts or on tours of inspection.  They were a jolly crowd, like a lot of rollicking schoolboys,  full of fun and good-humour, chaffing and joking all day; but when  a question of business came up, the serious businessman appeared  in each, and the Company's interest was cared for with their best  powers. The bottle was not entirely absent in these scow fraternities,  but I saw no one the worse for liquor on the trip.    The men of mixed blood jabbered in French, Cree, and Chipewyan  chiefly, but when they wanted to swear, they felt the inadequacy  of these mellifluous or lisping tongues, and fell back on virile  Saxon, whose tang, projectivity, and wealth of vile epithet  evidently supplied a long-felt want in the Great Lone Land of the  Dog and Canoe.    In the afternoon Preble and I pushed on in our boat, far in advance  of the brigade. As we made early supper I received for the twentieth  time a lesson in photography. A cock Partridge or Ruffed Grouse  came and drummed on a log in open view, full sunlight, fifty feet  away. I went quietly to the place. He walked off, but little alarmed.  I set the camera eight feet from the log, with twenty-five feet of  tubing, and retired to a good hiding-place. But alas! I put the  tube on the left-hand pump, not knowing that that was a dummy.  The Grouse came back in three minutes, drumming in a superb pose  squarely in front of the camera. I used the pump, but saw that it  failed to operate; on going forward the Grouse skimmed away and  returned no more. Preble said, \"Never mind; there will be another  every hundred yards all the way down the river, later on.\" I could  only reply, \"The chance never comes but once,\" and so it proved.  We heard Grouse drumming many times afterward, but the sun was low,  or the places densely shaded, or the mosquitoes made conditions  impossible for silent watching; the perfect chance came but once,  as it always does, and I lost it.    About twenty miles below the Landing we found the abandoned winter  hut of a trapper; on the roof were the dried up bodies of 1 Skunk,  2 Foxes, and 30 Lynxes, besides the bones of 2 Moose, showing the  nature of the wild life about.    That night, as the river was brimming and safe, we tied up to the  scows and drifted, making 30 more miles, or 60 since embarking.    In the early morning, I was much struck by the lifelessness of the  scene. The great river stretched away northward, the hills rose  abruptly from the water's edge, everywhere extended the superb  spruce forest, here fortunately unburnt; but there seemed no sign of  living creature outside of our own numerous, noisy, and picturesque  party. River, hills, and woods were calm and silent. It was  impressive, if disappointing; and, when at last the fir stillness  was broken by a succession of trumpet notes from the Great Pileated  Woodpecker, the sound went rolling on and on, in reverberating  echoes that might well have alarmed the bird himself.    The white spruce forest along the banks is most inspiring, magnificent  here. Down the terraced slopes and right to the water's edge on the  alluvial soil it stands in ranks. Each year, of course, the floods  undercut the banks, and more trees fall, to become at last the  flotsam of the shore a thousand miles away.    There is something sad about these stately trees, densely packed,  all a-row, unflinching, hopelessly awaiting the onset of the  inexorable, invincible river. One group, somewhat isolated and  formal, was a forest life parallel to Lady Butler's famous \"Roll  Call of the Grenadiers.\"    At night we reached the Indian village of Pelican Portage, and  landed by climbing over huge blocks of ice that were piled along  the shore. The adult male inhabitants came down to our camp, so  that the village was deserted, except for the children and a few  women.    As I walked down the crooked trail along which straggle the cabins,  I saw something white in a tree at the far end. Supposing it to be  a White-rabbit in a snare, I went near and found, to my surprise,  first that it was a dead house-cat, a rare species here; second,  under it, eyeing it and me alternately, was a hungry-looking Lynx.  I had a camera, for it was near sundown, and in the woods, so I  went back to the boat and returned with a gun. There was the Lynx  still prowling, but now farther from the village. I do not believe  he would have harmed the children, but a Lynx is game. I fired,  and he fell without a quiver or a sound. This was the first time  I had used a gun in many years, and was the only time on the trip.  I felt rather guilty, but the carcass was a godsend to two old  Indians who were sickening on a long diet of salt pork, and that  Lynx furnished them tender meat for three days afterward; while  its skin and skull went to the American Museum.    On the night of May 20, we camped just above Grand Rapids--Preble  and I alone, for the first time, under canvas, and glad indeed  to get away from the noisy rabble of the boatmen, though now they  were but a quarter mile off. At first I had found them amusing  and picturesque, but their many unpleasant habits, their distinct  aversion to strangers, their greediness to get all they could out  of one, and do nothing in return, combined finally with their habit  of gambling all night to the loud beating of a tin pan, made me  thankful to quit their company for a time.    At Grand Rapids the scows were unloaded, the goods shipped over  a quarter-mile hand tramway, on an island, the scows taken down a  side channel, one by one, and reloaded. This meant a delay of three  or four days, during which we camped on the island and gathered  specimens.    Being the organizer, equipper, geographer, artist, head, and tail of  the expedition, I was, perforce, also its doctor. Equipped with a  \"pill-kit,\" an abundance of blisters and bandages and some \"potent  purgatives,\" I had prepared myself to render first and last aid to  the hurt in my own party. In taking instructions from our family  physician, I had learned the value of a profound air of great  gravity, a noble reticence, and a total absence of doubt, when I  did speak. I compressed his creed into a single phrase: \"In case of  doubt, look wise and work on his 'bowels.'\" This simple equipment  soon gave me a surprisingly high standing among the men. I was  a medicine man of repute, and soon had a larger practice than I  desired, as it was entirely gratuitous.    The various boatmen, Indians and half-breeds, came with their  troubles, and, thanks chiefly to their faith, were cured. But one  day John MacDonald, the chief pilot and a mighty man on the river,  came to my tent on Grand Island. John complained that he couldn't  hold anything on his stomach; he was a total peristaltic wreck indeed  (my words; his were more simple and more vivid, but less sonorous  and professional). He said he had been going down hill for two  weeks, and was so bad now that he was \"no better than a couple of  ordinary men.\"    \"Exactly so,\" I said. \"Now you take these pills and you'll be all  right in the morning.\" Next morning John was back, and complained  that my pills had no effect; he wanted to feel something take hold  of him. Hadn't 1 any pepper-juice or brandy?    I do not take liquor on an expedition, but at the last moment  a"]]]
