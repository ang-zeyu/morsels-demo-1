Instead of my painfully  familiar freckled face and skinny frame, I saw a red, full jowled face  with bags beneath the watery blue eyes, set on a distinctly portly body  which was cleverly camouflaged as burliness by impeccable tweeds of the  kind specially made up in London for the American broker's trade.    \"I look like hell!\" I muttered. \"Well, tell me this, Ranty. What  happened to Frank Jacklin? Or is that part of the gag?\"    Tolan turned and stared at me with an official glitter in his Navy  (Reserve) eye. \"Jacklin? He _was_ at Kwajalein with me, now that I  think of it. A skinny sort of s.o.b., wasn't he?\"    \"I wouldn't say that,\" I hotly rejoined. \"I thought he was a pretty  decent sort of guy. Where is he?\"    \"Jacklin? Oh, he got another half-stripe last January and was given  some screw-ball assignment which took him out of touch. He'll turn up  sooner or later, without a scratch; those New Dealers always do.\"    \"Say,\" Tolan added. \"You always did have a Jacklin fixation but you  never had a good word to say for the louse. What did he ever do to you,  anyhow? Ever since I've known you, you've always been griping about  him, specially since he got into uniform. Lay off, will you, and give  us honest hard-drinking guys a chance to get a breath. Period.\"    I took my drink and sipped it attentively. Whatever had happened to me  since the thorium bomb burst off Adak, this was Scotch and it was cold,  so I doubted that this place was Hell. Probably it was all a dream in  the last split-second of disintegration.    \"Thanks, Ranty, that feels better. Now I've got to be going.\"    \"Winnie,\" drawled one of the brokers, \"tell us who she is this time.  You ought to stop chasing at your age and blood-pressure or let your  friends in on the secret.\"    \"This time,\" I said, \"I'm going home.\"    The steward came around from the bar and helped me into a fine  fur-lined overcoat which I assumed was the lawful property of Winnie  Tompkins.    \"There were two telephone messages for you, sir, while you were  dozing,\" he said.    \"Who were they from, Tammy?\"    \"The first one, sir, was from the vet's to say that Ponto--that would  be your dog, sir--would recover after all. He was the one that had  distemper so bad, wasn't it, sir? I remember you told me that he was  expected to die any minute. Well, now, the vet says he will recover.  The second call, sir, was from Mrs. Tompkins. She asked if you had left  for your home.\"    \"What did you tell her, Tammy?\" I asked.    \"Why, what you told me, sir, of course, when you came in, sir. I said  that you hadn't been in all day, but that I would deliver any messages.\"    Wait a minute, Jacklin, I said to myself. Let's figure this one out. We  were blown up on the Alaska, off the westernmost Aleutians, and now we  find ourselves at the Pond Club, in New York City, masquerading in the  flabby body of Winnie Tompkins. This must be Purgatory, since nobody  who has ever been there would call the Pond--or, as the initiates  prefer, the Puddle--either Heaven or Hell. This is one of those damned  puzzles designed to test our intelligence. My cue is to turn in the  best and most convincing performance as Winnie Tompkins, who has  undoubtedly been sent to Hell. If we pass, we'll be like the rats the  scientists send racing through mazes: we'll get the cheese and move  on up. If we flunk, we'll be sent down, as the English say. Ingenious  deity, the Manager!    \"Tammy,\" I said, \"will you get me the latest Social Register?\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    I sat down by the door and thumbed through the testament of social  acceptability as measured in Manhattan. There I was: Winfred S.  (Sturgis) Tompkins. Born, New York City, April 27, 1898. St. Mark's  School, Southboro, Mass., 1916. Harvard, A. B. 1920. Married: Miss  Germaine Lewis Schuyler, of New York City, 1936. Clubs: Porcellian,  Pond, Racquet, Harvard, Westchester Country. Residence: \"Pook's Hill,\"  Bedford Hills, N.Y. Office: No. 1 Wall Street, N.Y.C.    \"Thanks, Tammy,\" I said and returned the register to him.    Then I reached inside my coat and pulled out the well-stuffed  pocket-book I found inside the suave tweeds. It was of ostrich-hide  with W.S.T. in gold letters on it, and contained--in addition to some  junk which I didn't bother to examine--sixty-one dollars in small bills  and a new commutation-ticket between New York City and Bedford Hills,  N.Y.    So far, so good. My sense of identity was building up rapidly. I felt  in my trousers' pocket and found a bunch of keys and about a dollar  and a half in silver. I peeled a five-dollar bill from the roll in the  pocket-book and handed it to the club steward.    \"This is for you, Tammy, and a happy Easter Monday to you. If anyone  calls, you haven't seen me all day.\"    \"Thank you very much, sir, I'm sure,\" he said, pocketing the five spot  with the effortless ease of a prestidigitator or head-waiter.    I strolled out to the street--dusk was beginning to darken the city  and already there were lights burning in the office windows--and  walked across to the corner of Park Avenue. To my surprise, remembering  New York, there were few taxis and those were already occupied. After  about five minutes of vain waiting, I remembered reading somewhere  of the cab shortage in the United States, and walked south to Grand  Central. As I turned down Vanderbilt Avenue, I noticed something  fairly bulky in the pocket of my overcoat. I stopped and dragged out  two expensively tidy packages, with the Tiffany label on them. One was  inscribed \"For Jimmie\" and the other \"For Virginia.\"    This represented a new puzzle--perhaps a trap--so I paid a dime for  the use of one of the pay-toilets in the Terminal and unwrapped my  find. The one marked for \"Jimmie\"--who might be, I guessed, my wife  Germaine--was a neat little solid gold bracelet, the sort of thing you  give your eldest niece on graduation day. The one marked \"Virginia\"  contained a diamond-brooch of the kind all too rarely given to a girl  for any good reason.    \"Uh-uh!\" I shook my head. Whoever \"Virginia\" might be, she was  obviously not my wife and the Social Register had not mentioned any  children, ex-wives or such appertaining to Winnie Tompkins. And you  don't give diamonds to your aged aunt or your mother-in-law. We can't  have Winnie start off his new life by palming off mere gold on his  wedded wife and diamonds on the Other Woman, I decided. So I switched  the labels on the packages and returned to circulation in time to  catch the 4:45 Westchester Express.           *       *       *       *       *    Here, I resorted to a low subterfuge. Instead of the broker's bible,  \"The New York Sun,\" with its dim view of all that had happened to the  commuting public since 1932, I was coward enough to disguise myself by  buying a copy of \"P.M.\" in order to lessen the risk of being recognized  by fellow-passengers whom I certainly would not know by sight. I buried  my face in that spirited journal, with its dim view of all that had  ever happened outside the Soviet Union, as I slunk past the Club Car,  and did not fully emerge from its gallant defense of the Negro and the  Jew until I was in the smoker, directly behind the baggage compartment.  The train was fairly crowded but I was able to find a seat far forward  where few passengers could see my face. I decided that my strategy had  been sound when the conductor, on punching my ticket, remarked: \"See  you're not using the Club Car today, Mr. Tompkins. Shall I tell Mr.  Snyder not to wait for you for gin rummy?\"    \"Don't tell him a thing, please,\" I begged. \"I'm feeling done in--a  friend of mine was just killed in the Pacific--and I don't want to be  bothered.\"    He clucked consolingly and passed on. I was lucky enough to reach  Bedford Hills without other encounters and walked along the darkened  platform until I spied a taxicab.    \"Can you drive me out to my place?\" I asked the driver.    \"Sure, Mr. Tompkins. Glad to,\" he replied. \"Goin' to leave your coop  down here?\"    I nodded. \"Yep. I'm too damned tired to drive home. Got any other  passengers?\"    \"Only a couple of maids from the Milgrim place,\" he said, \"but we can  drop you first and let them off afterwards if you're feelin' low.\"    \"Hell, no!\" I insisted. \"This is a free country--first come first  served. You can drive me on to Pook's Hill after you've left them at  the Milgrim's. Perhaps they'd get in trouble if they were delayed.\"    The driver looked surprised and rather relieved.    \"Haven't heard of any employers firin' maids in these parts since  Wilkie was a candidate,\" he said.    I climbed into the cab, across the rather shapely legs and domestic  laps of two attractive-looking girls who murmured vaguely at me and  then resumed a discussion of the awful cost of hair-do's. I felt  rather pleased with myself. I seemed to have won at least one man's  approval in the opening stages of my celestial rat-race. Now for my  first meeting with the woman whom I had married nearly ten years ago,  according to the Social Register. Surely she would recognize that there  was something radically wrong with her husband before I had been five  minutes at Pook's Hill. Why! I wouldn't know where the lavatory was,  let alone her bedroom, and what should I call the maid who answered the  door, assuming we had a maid?          CHAPTER 2      A pretty, dark-haired maid opened the door of \"Pook's Hill\" with a  twitch of the hip that was wasted on Bedford Hills.    \"Oh, it's you!\" She remarked conversationally. \"Shall I tell Mrs.  Tompkins you are here?\"    \"And why not?\" I asked.    She looked at me slant-eyed. \"Why not, sir? She must have forgotten to  eat an apple this morning. That's why.\"    \"Where shall I dump my hat and coat, Mary?\" I asked guessing wildly at  her name. Suburban maids were named Mary as often as not.    \"The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/519"],[0,"A Kidnapped Santa Claus (#2)"],[1,"four favorite assistants.  These little people he had often found very useful in helping him to  distribute his gifts to the children, and when their master was so  suddenly dragged from the sleigh they were all snugly tucked  underneath the seat, where the sharp wind could not reach them.    The tiny immortals knew nothing of the capture of Santa Claus until  some time after he had disappeared.  But finally they missed his  cheery voice, and as their master always sang or whistled on his  journeys, the silence warned them that something was wrong.    Little Wisk stuck out his head from underneath the seat and found  Santa Claus gone and no one to direct the flight of the reindeer.    \"Whoa!\" he called out, and the deer obediently slackened speed and  came to a halt.    Peter and Nuter and Kilter all jumped upon the seat and looked back  over the track made by the sleigh.  But Santa Claus had been left  miles and miles behind.    \"What shall we do?\" asked Wisk anxiously, all the mirth and mischief  banished from his wee face by this great calamity.    \"We must go back at once and find our master,\" said Nuter the Ryl, who  thought and spoke with much deliberation.    \"No, no!\" exclaimed Peter the Knook, who, cross and crabbed though he  was, might always be depended upon in an emergency.  \"If we delay, or  go back, there will not be time to get the toys to the children before  morning; and that would grieve Santa Claus more than anything else.\"    \"It is certain that some wicked creatures have captured him,\" added  Kilter thoughtfully, \"and their object must be to make the children  unhappy.  So our first duty is to get the toys distributed as  carefully as if Santa Claus were himself present.  Afterward we  can search for our master and easily secure his freedom.\"    This seemed such good and sensible advice that the others at once  resolved to adopt it.  So Peter the Knook called to the reindeer, and  the faithful animals again sprang forward and dashed over hill and  valley, through forest and plain, until they came to the houses  wherein children lay sleeping and dreaming of the pretty gifts they  would find on Christmas morning.    The little immortals had set themselves a difficult task; for although  they had assisted Santa Claus on many of his journeys, their master  had always directed and guided them and told them exactly what he  wished them to do.  But now they had to distribute the toys according  to their own judgment, and they did not understand children as well as  did old Santa.  So it is no wonder they made some laughable errors.    Mamie Brown, who wanted a doll, got a drum instead; and a drum is of  no use to a girl who loves dolls.  And Charlie Smith, who delights to  romp and play out of doors, and who wanted some new rubber boots to  keep his feet dry, received a sewing box filled with colored worsteds  and threads and needles, which made him so provoked that he  thoughtlessly called our dear Santa Claus a fraud.    Had there been many such mistakes the Daemons would have accomplished  their evil purpose and made the children unhappy.  But the little  friends of the absent Santa Claus labored faithfully and intelligently  to carry out their master's ideas, and they made fewer errors than  might be expected under such unusual circumstances.    And, although they worked as swiftly as possible, day had begun to  break before the toys and other presents were all distributed; so for  the first time in many years the reindeer trotted into the Laughing  Valley, on their return, in broad daylight, with the brilliant sun  peeping over the edge of the forest to prove they were far behind  their accustomed hours.    Having put the deer in the stable, the little folk began to wonder how  they might rescue their master; and they realized they must discover,  first of all, what had happened to him and where he was.    So Wisk the Fairy transported himself to the bower of the Fairy Queen,  which was located deep in the heart of the Forest of Burzee; and once  there, it did not take him long to find out all about the naughty  Daemons and how they had kidnapped the good Santa Claus to prevent his  making children happy.  The Fairy Queen also promised her assistance,  and then, fortified by this powerful support, Wisk flew back to where  Nuter and Peter and Kilter awaited him, and the four counseled  together and laid plans to rescue their master from his enemies.    It is possible that Santa Claus was not as merry as usual during the  night that succeeded his capture.  For although he had faith in the  judgment of his little friends he could not avoid a certain amount of  worry, and an anxious look would creep at times into his kind old eyes  as he thought of the disappointment that might await his dear little  children.  And the Daemons, who guarded him by turns, one after  another, did not neglect to taunt him with contemptuous words in his  helpless condition.    When Christmas Day dawned the Daemon of Malice was guarding the  prisoner, and his tongue was sharper than that of any of the others.    \"The children are waking up, Santa!\" he cried.  \"They are waking up to  find their stockings empty!  Ho, ho!  How they will quarrel, and wail,  and stamp their feet in anger!  Our caves will be full today, old  Santa!  Our caves are sure to be full!\"    But to this, as to other like taunts, Santa Claus answered nothing.  He was much grieved by his capture, it is true; but his courage did  not forsake him.  And, finding that the prisoner would not reply to  his jeers, the Daemon of Malice presently went away, and sent the  Daemon of Repentance to take his place.    This last personage was not so disagreeable as the others.  He had  gentle and refined features, and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone.    \"My brother Daemons do not trust me overmuch,\" said he, as he entered  the cavern; \"but it is morning, now, and the mischief is done.  You  cannot visit the children again for another year.\"    \"That is true,\" answered Santa Claus, almost cheerfully;  \"Christmas Eve is past, and for the first time in centuries  I have not visited my children.\"    \"The little ones will be greatly disappointed,\" murmured the Daemon of  Repentance, almost regretfully; \"but that cannot be helped now.  Their  grief is likely to make the children selfish and envious and hateful,  and if they come to the Caves of the Daemons today I shall get a  chance to lead some of them to my Cave of Repentance.\"    \"Do you never repent, yourself?\" asked Santa Claus, curiously.    \"Oh, yes, indeed,\" answered the Daemon.  \"I am even now repenting that  I assisted in your capture.  Of course it is too late to remedy the  evil that has been done; but repentance, you know, can come only after  an evil thought or deed, for in the beginning there is nothing to  repent of.\"    \"So I understand,\" said Santa Claus.  \"Those who avoid evil need never  visit your cave.\"    \"As a rule, that is true,\" replied the Daemon; \"yet you, who have done  no evil, are about to visit my cave at once; for to prove that I sincerely  regret my share in your capture I am going to permit you to escape.\"    This speech greatly surprised the prisoner, until he reflected that it  was just what might be expected of the Daemon of Repentance.  The  fellow at once busied himself untying the knots that bound Santa Claus  and unlocking the chains that fastened him to the wall.  Then he  led the way through a long tunnel until they both emerged in the  Cave of Repentance.    \"I hope you will forgive me,\" said the Daemon pleadingly.  \"I am not  really a bad person, you know; and I believe I accomplish a great deal  of good in the world.\"    With this he opened a back door that let in a flood of sunshine, and  Santa Claus sniffed the fresh air gratefully.    \"I bear no malice,\" said he to the Daemon, in a gentle voice; \"and I  am sure the world would be a dreary place without you.  So, good  morning, and a Merry Christmas to you!\"    With these words he stepped out to greet the bright morning, and a  moment later he was trudging along, whistling softly to himself, on  his way to his home in the Laughing Valley.    Marching over the snow toward the mountain was a vast army, made up of  the most curious creatures imaginable.  There were numberless knooks  from the forest, as rough and crooked in appearance as the gnarled  branches of the trees they ministered to.  And there were dainty ryls  from the fields, each one bearing the emblem of the flower or plant it  guarded.  Behind these were many ranks of pixies, gnomes and nymphs, and  in the rear a thousand beautiful fairies floated along in gorgeous array.    This wonderful army was led by Wisk, Peter, Nuter, and Kilter, who had  assembled it to rescue Santa Claus from captivity and to punish the  Daemons who had dared to take him away from his beloved children.    And, although they looked so bright and peaceful, the little immortals  were armed with powers that would be very terrible to those who had  incurred their anger.  Woe to the Daemons of the Caves if this mighty  army of vengeance ever met them!    But lo! coming to meet his loyal friends appeared the imposing form of  Santa Claus, his white beard floating in the breeze and his bright  eyes sparkling with pleasure at this proof of the love and veneration  he had inspired in the hearts of the most powerful creatures in existence.    And while they clustered around him and danced with glee at his safe  return, he gave them earnest thanks for their support.  But Wisk, and  Nuter, and Peter, and Kilter, he embraced affectionately.    \"It is useless to pursue the Daemons,\" said Santa Claus to the army.  \"They have their place in the world, and can never be destroyed.  But  that is a great pity, nevertheless,\" he continued musingly.    So the fairies, and knooks, and pixies, and ryls all escorted the good  man to his castle, and there left him to talk over the events of the"]]]
