Calyx of 3  sepals; corolla of 3 rounded, spreading petals. Stamens and pistils  numerous, the former yellow in upper flowers; usually absent or  imperfect in lower pistillate flowers. _Leaves_: Exceedingly variable;  those under water usually long and grass-like; upper ones sharply  arrow-shaped or blunt and broad, spongy or leathery, on long petioles.    _Preferred Habitat_--Shallow water and mud.    _Flowering Season_--July-September.    _Distribution_--From Mexico northward throughout our area to the  circumpolar regions.    Wading into shallow water or standing on some muddy shore, like a heron,  this striking plant, so often found in that bird's haunts, is quite as  decorative in a picture, and, happily, far more approachable in life.  Indeed, one of the comforts of botany as compared with bird study is  that we may get close enough to the flowers to observe their last  detail, whereas the bird we have followed laboriously over hill and  dale, through briers and swamps, darts away beyond the range of  field-glasses with tantalizing swiftness.    While no single plant is yet thoroughly known to scientists, in spite of  the years of study devoted by specialists to separate groups, no plant  remains wholly meaningless. When Keppler discovered the majestic order  of movement of the heavenly bodies, he exclaimed, \"O God, I think Thy  thoughts after Thee!\"--the expression of a discipleship every reverent  soul must be conscious of in penetrating, be it ever so little a way,  into the inner meaning of the humblest wayside weed.    Any plant which elects to grow in shallow water must be amphibious: it  must be able to breathe beneath the surface as the fish do, and also be  adapted to thrive without those parts that correspond to gills; for  ponds and streams have an unpleasant way of drying up in summer,  leaving it stranded on the shore. This accounts in part for the  variable leaves on the arrow-head, those underneath the water being  long and ribbon-like, to bring the greatest possible area into contact  with the air with which the water is charged. Broad leaves would be  torn to shreds by the current through which grass-like blades glide  harmlessly; but when this plant grows on shore, having no longer use  for its lower ribbons, it loses them, and expands only broad  arrow-shaped surfaces to the sunny air, leaves to be supplied with  carbonic acid to assimilate, and sunshine to turn off, the oxygen and  store up the carbon into their system.          ARUM FAMILY _(Araceae)_      Jack-in-the-Pulpit; Indian Turnip    _Arisaema triphyllum_    _Flowers_--Minute, greenish yellow, clustered on the lower part of a  smooth, club-shaped, slender spadix within a green and maroon or  whitish-striped spathe that curves in a broad-pointed flap above it.  _Leaves:_ 3-foliate, usually overtopping the spathe, their slender  petioles 9 to 30 in. high, or as tall as the scape that rises from an  acrid corm. _Fruit:_ Smooth, shining red berries clustered on the  thickened club.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist woodland and thickets.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia westward to Minnesota, and southward to the  Gulf states.    A jolly-looking preacher is Jack, standing erect in his parti-colored  pulpit with a sounding-board over his head; but he is a gay deceiver, a  wolf in sheep's clothing, literally a \"brother to dragons,\" an arrant  upstart, an ingrate, a murderer of innocent benefactors! \"Female  botanizing classes pounce upon it as they would upon a pious young  clergyman,\" complains Mr. Ellwanger. A poor relation of the stately  calla lily one knows Jack to be at a glance, her lovely white robe  corresponding to his striped pulpit, her bright yellow spadix to his  sleek reverence. In the damp woodlands where his pulpit is erected  beneath leafy cathedral arches, minute flies or gnats, recently emerged  from maggots in mushrooms, toadstools, or decaying logs, form the main  part of his congregation.    Now, to drop the clerical simile, let us peep within the sheathing  spathe, or, better still, strip it off altogether. Doctor Torrey states  that the dark-striped spathes are the fertile plants, those with green  and whitish lines, sterile. Within are smooth, glossy columns, and near  the base of each we shall find the true flowers, minute affairs, some  staminate; others, on distinct plants, pistillate, the berry bearers; or  rarely both male and female florets seated on the same club, as if  Jack's elaborate plan to prevent self-fertilization were not yet  complete. Plants may be detected in process of evolution toward their  ideals just as nations and men are. Doubtless when Jack's mechanism is  perfected, his guilt will disappear. A little way above the florets the  club enlarges abruptly, forming a projecting ledge that effectually  closes the avenue of escape for many a guileless victim. A fungous gnat,  enticed perhaps by the striped house of refuge from cold spring winds,  and with a prospect of food below, enters and slides down the inside  walls or the slippery, colored column: in either case descent is very  easy; it is the return that is made so difficult, if not impossible, for  the tiny visitors. Squeezing past the projecting ledge, the gnat finds  himself in a roomy apartment whose floor--the bottom of the pulpit--is  dusted over with fine pollen; that is, if he is among staminate flowers  already mature. To get some of that pollen, with which the gnat  presently covers himself, transferred to the minute pistillate florets  waiting for it in a distant chamber is, of course, Jack's whole aim in  enticing visitors within his polished walls; but what means are provided  for their escape? Their efforts to crawl upward over the slippery  surface only land them weak and discouraged where they started. The  projecting ledge overhead prevents them from using their wings; the  passage between the ledge and the spathe is far too narrow to permit  flight. Now, if a gnat be persevering, he will presently discover a gap  in the flap where the spathe folds together in front, and through this  tiny opening he makes his escape, only to enter another pulpit, like the  trusted, but too trusting, messenger he is, and leave some of the  vitalizing pollen on the fertile florets awaiting his coming.    But suppose the fly, small as he is, is too large to work his way out  through the flap, or too bewildered or stupid to find the opening, or  too exhausted after his futile efforts to get out through the overhead  route to persevere, or too weak with hunger in case of long detention in  a pistillate trap where no pollen is, what then? Open a dozen of Jack's  pulpits, and in several, at least, dead victims will be found--pathetic  little corpses sacrificed to the imperfection of his executive system.  Had the flies entered mature spathes, whose walls had spread outward and  away from the polished column, flight through the overhead route might  have been possible. However glad we may be to make every due allowance  for this sacrifice of the higher life to the lower, as only a temporary  imperfection of mechanism incidental to the plant's higher development,  Jack's present cruelty shocks us no less. Or, it may be, he will become  insectivorous like the pitcher plant in time. He comes from a rascally  family, anyhow. His cousin, the cuckoo-pint, as is well known, destroys  the winged messenger bearing its offspring to plant fresh colonies in a  distant bog, because the decayed body of the bird acts as the best  possible fertilizer into which the seedling may strike its roots.    In June and July the thick-set club, studded over with bright berries,  becomes conspicuous, to attract hungry woodland rovers in the hope that  the seeds will be dropped far from the parent plant. The Indians used to  boil the berries for food. The farinaceous root (corm) they likewise  boiled or dried to extract the stinging, blistering juice, leaving an  edible little \"turnip,\" however insipid and starchy.      Skunk or Swamp Cabbage    _Symplocarpus foetidus_    _Flowers_--Minute, perfect, foetid; many scattered over a thick,  rounded, fleshy spadix, and hidden within a swollen, shell-shaped,  purplish-brown to greenish-yellow, usually mottled, spathe, close to the  ground, that appears before the leaves. Spadix much enlarged and spongy  in fruit, the bulb-like berries imbedded in its surface. _Leaves:_ In  large crowns like cabbages, broadly ovate, often 1 ft. across, strongly  nerved, their petioles with deep grooves, malodorous.    _Preferred Habitat_--Swamps, wet ground.    _Flowering Season_--February-April.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Florida, and westward to Minnesota and  Iowa.    This despised relative of the stately calla lily proclaims spring in the  very teeth of winter, being the first bold adventurer above ground. When  the lovely hepatica, the first flower worthy the name to appear, is  still wrapped in her fuzzy furs, the skunk cabbage's dark, incurved  horn shelters within its hollow, tiny, malodorous florets. Why is the  entire plant so foetid that one flees the neighborhood, pervaded as it  is with an odor that combines a suspicion of skunk, putrid meat, and  garlic? After investigating the Carrion-flower and the Purple Trillium,  among others, we learned that certain flies delight in foul odors  loathsome to higher organisms; that plants dependent on these pollen  carriers woo them from long distances with a stench, and in addition  sometimes try to charm them with color resembling the sort of meat it is  their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8909"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"esis. He dares not cultivate his  reason, because from his earliest days he has been taught to consider  it criminal. He pretends to know his date in the indistinct abodes of  another life, before he has considered of the means by which he is to  render himself happy in the world he inhabits: in short, man disdains  the study of Nature, except it be partially: he pursues phantoms  that resemble an _ignis-fatuus_, which at once dazzle, bewilders, and  affright: like the benighted traveller led astray by these deceptive  exhalations of a swampy soil, he frequently quits the plain, the simple  road of truth, by pursuing of which, he can alone ever reasonably hope  to reach the goal of happiness.    The most important of our duties, then, is to seek means by which we may  destroy delusions that can never do more than mislead us. The remedies  for these evils must be sought for in Nature herself; it is only in  the abundance of her resources, that we can rationally expect to find  antidotes to the mischiefs brought upon us by an ill directed, by an  overpowering enthusiasm. It is time these remedies were sought; it is  time to look the evil boldly in the face, to examine its foundations,  to scrutinize its superstructure: reason, with its faithful guide  experience, must attack in their entrenchments those prejudices, to  which the human race has but too long been the victim. For this purpose  reason must be restored to its proper rank,--it must be rescued from  the evil company with which it is associated. It has been too long  degraded--too long neglected--cowardice has rendered it subservient to  delirium, the slave to falsehood. It must no longer be held down by the  massive claims of ignorant prejudice.    Truth is invariable--it is requisite to man--it can never harm him--his  very necessities, sooner or later, make him sensible of this; oblige him  to acknowledge it. Let us then discover it to mortals--let us exhibit  its charms--let us shed it effulgence over the darkened road; it is  the only mode by which man can become disgusted with that disgraceful  superstition which leads him into error, and which but too often usurps  his homage by treacherously covering itself with the mask of truth--its  lustre can wound none but those enemies to the human race whose power is  bottomed solely on the ignorance, on the darkness in which they have in  almost every claimed contrived to involve the mind of man.    Truth speaks not to those perverse beings:--her voice can only be heard  by generous souls accustomed to reflection, whose sensibilities make  them lament the numberless calamities showered on the earth by political  and religious tyranny--whose enlightened minds contemplate with horror  the immensity, the ponderosity of that series of misfortunes which error  has in all ages overwhelmed mankind.    To error must be attributed those insupportable chains which tyrants,  which priests have forged for most nations. To error must be equally  attributed that abject slavery into which the people of almost every  country have fallen. Nature designed they should pursue their happiness  by the most perfect freedom.--To error must be attributed those  religious terrors which, in almost every climate, have either petrified  man with fear, or caused him to destroy himself for coarse or fanciful  beings. To error must be attributed those inveterate hatreds, those  barbarous persecutions, those numerous massacres, those dreadful  tragedies, of which, under pretext of serving the interests of heaven,  the earth has been but too frequently made the theatre. It is error  consecrated by religious enthusiasm, which produces that ignorance,  that uncertainty in which man ever finds himself with regard to his most  evident duties, his clearest rights, the most demonstrable truths.  In short, man is almost everywhere a poor degraded captive, devoid of  greatness of soul, of reason, or of virtue, whom his inhuman gaolers  have never permitted to see the light of day.    Let us then endeavour to disperse those clouds of ignorance, those  mists of darkness, which impede man on his journey, which obscure his  progress, which prevent his marching through life with a firm, with a  steady grip. Let us try to inspire him with courage--with respect for  his reason--with an inextinguishable love for truth--with a remembrance  of Gallileo--to the end that he may learn to know himself--to know his  legitimate rights--that he may learn to consult his experience, and no  longer be the dupe of an imagination led astray by authority--that he  may renounce the prejudices of his childhood--that he may learn to  found his morals on his nature, on his wants, on the real advantage of  society--that he may dare to love himself--that he may learn to pursue  his true happiness by promoting that of others--in short, that he may no  longer occupy himself with reveries either useless or dangerous--that he  may become a virtuous, a rational being, in which case he cannot fail to  become happy.    If he must have his chimeras, let him at least learn to permit others  to form theirs after their own fashion; since nothing can be more  immaterial than the manner of men's thinking on subjects not accessible  to reason, provided those thoughts be not suffered to embody themselves  into actions injurious to others: above all, let him be fully persuaded  that it is of the utmost importance to the inhabitants of this world to  be JUST, KIND, and PEACEABLE.    Far from injuring the cause of virtue, an impartial examination of the  principles of this work will shew that its object is to restore truth  to its proper temple, to build up an altar whose foundations shall be  consolidated by morality, reason, and justice: from this sacred pane,  virtue guarded by truth, clothed with experience, shall shed forth her  radiance on delighted mortals; whose homage flowing consecutively shall  open to the world a new aera, by rendering general the belief that  happiness, the true end of man's existence, can never be attained but BY  PROMOTING THAT OF HIS FELLOW CREATURE.    In short, man should learn to know, that happiness is simply an  emanative quality formed by reflection; that each individual ought to  be the sun of his own system, continually shedding around him his genial  rays; that these, re-acting, will keep his own existence constantly  supplied with the requisite heat to enable him to put forth kindly  fruit._          MIRABAUD'S SYSTEM OF NATURE      Translated from the Original, By Samuel Wilkinson.          PART I.    LAWS OF NATURE--OF MAN--THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL--DOCTRINE OF  IMMORTALITY--ON HAPPINESS.          CHAP. I.    _Nature and her Laws_.      Man has always deceived himself when he abandoned experience to follow  imaginary systems.--He is the work of nature.--He exists in Nature.--He  is submitted to the laws of Nature.--He cannot deliver himself from  them:--cannot step beyond them even in thought. It is in vain his mind  would spring forward beyond the visible world: direful and imperious  necessity ever compels his return--being formed by Nature, he is  circumscribed by her laws; there exists nothing beyond the great whole  of which he forms a part, of which he experiences the influence. The  beings his fancy pictures as above nature, or distinguished from her,  are always chimeras formed after that which he has already seen, but of  which it is utterly impossible he should ever form any finished idea,  either as to the place they occupy, or their manner of acting--for him  there is not, there can be nothing out of that Nature which includes all  beings.    Therefore, instead of seeking out of the world he inhabits for beings  who can procure him a happiness denied to him by Nature, let him study  this Nature, learn her laws, contemplate her energies, observe the  immutable rules by which she acts.--Let him apply these discoveries to  his own felicity, and submit in silence to her precepts, which nothing  can alter.--Let him cheerfully consent to be ignorant of causes hid from  him under the most impenetrable veil.--Let him yield to the decrees of  a universal power, which can never be brought within his comprehension,  nor ever emancipate him from those laws imposed on him by his essence.    The distinction which has been so often made between the _physical_ and  the _moral_ being, is evidently an abuse of terms. Man is a being  purely physical: the moral man is nothing more than this physical being  considered under a certain point of view; that is to say, with  relation to some of his modes of action, arising out of his individual  organization. But is not this organization itself the work of Nature?  The motion or impulse to action, of which he is susceptible, is that  not physical? His visible actions, as well as the invisible motion  interiorly excited by his will or his thoughts, are equally the natural  effects, the necessary consequences, of his peculiar construction,  and the impulse he receives from those beings by whom he is always  surrounded. All that the human mind has successively invented, with a  view to change or perfect his being, to render himself happy, was never  more than the necessary consequence of man's peculiar essence, and that  of the beings who act upon him. The object of all his institutions, all  his reflections, all his knowledge, is only to procure that happiness  toward which he is continually impelled by the peculiarity of his  nature. All that he does, all that he thinks, all that he is, all that  he will be, is nothing more than what Universal Nature has made him.  His ideas, his actions, his will, are the necessary effects of those  properties infused into him by Nature, and of those circumstances in  which she has placed him. In short, art is nothing but Nature acting  with the tools she has furnished.    Nature sends man naked and destitute into this world which is to be his  abode: he quickly learns to"]]]
