[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#2)"],[1,"damaged by  weather; some sea-lines on a dry shelf of rock; a couple of wooden  boxes; a pile of driftwood for fires, and a heap of quartz in which we  thought we had found veins of gold--such was the modest furnishing of  our den.  To this I must add some broken clay pipes, with which we made  believe to imitate our elders, smoking a foul mixture of coltsfoot  leaves and brown paper.  The band was in session, so following our  ritual we sent out a picket.  Tam was deputed to go round the edge of  the cliff from which the shore was visible, and report if the coast was  clear.    He returned in three minutes, his eyes round with amazement in the  lantern light.  'There's a fire on the sands,' he repeated, 'and a man  beside it.'    Here was news indeed.  Without a word we made for the open, Archie  first, and Tam, who had seized and shuttered his lantern, coming last.  We crawled to the edge of the cliff and peered round, and there sure  enough, on the hard bit of sand which the tide had left by the burn  mouth, was a twinkle of light and a dark figure.    The moon was rising, and besides there was that curious sheen from the  sea which you will often notice in spring.  The glow was maybe a  hundred yards distant, a little spark of fire I could have put in my  cap, and, from its crackling and smoke, composed of dry seaweed and  half-green branches from the burnside thickets.  A man's figure stood  near it, and as we looked it moved round and round the fire in circles  which first of all widened and then contracted.    The sight was so unexpected, so beyond the beat of our experience, that  we were all a little scared.  What could this strange being want with a  fire at half-past eight of an April Sabbath night on the Dyve Burn  sands?  We discussed the thing in whispers behind a boulder, but none  of us had any solution.  'Belike he's come ashore in a boat,' said  Archie.  'He's maybe a foreigner.'  But I pointed out that, from the  tracks which Archie himself had found, the man must have come overland  down the cliffs.  Tam was clear he was a madman, and was for  withdrawing promptly from the whole business.    But some spell kept our feet tied there in that silent world of sand  and moon and sea.  I remember looking back and seeing the solemn,  frowning faces of the cliffs, and feeling somehow shut in with this  unknown being in a strange union.  What kind of errand had brought this  interloper into our territory?  For a wonder I was less afraid than  curious.  I wanted to get to the heart of the matter, and to discover  what the man was up to with his fire and his circles.    The same thought must have been in Archie's head, for he dropped on his  belly and began to crawl softly seawards.  I followed, and Tam, with  sundry complaints, crept after my heels.  Between the cliffs and the  fire lay some sixty yards of _d√©bris_ and boulders above the level of all  but the high spring tides.  Beyond lay a string of seaweedy pools and  then the hard sands of the burnfoot.  There was excellent cover among  the big stones, and apart from the distance and the dim light, the man  by the fire was too preoccupied in his task to keep much look-out  towards the land.  I remember thinking he had chosen his place well,  for save from the sea he could not be seen.  The cliffs are so undercut  that unless a watcher on the coast were on their extreme edge he would  not see the burnfoot sands.    Archie, the skilled tracker, was the one who all but betrayed us.  His  knee slipped on the seaweed, and he rolled off a boulder, bringing down  with him a clatter of small stones.  We lay as still as mice, in terror  lest the man should have heard the noise and have come to look for the  cause.  By-and-by when I ventured to raise my head above a flat-topped  stone I saw that he was undisturbed.  The fire still burned, and he was  pacing round it. On the edge of the pools was an outcrop of red  sandstone much fissured by the sea.  Here was an excellent  vantage-ground, and all three of us curled behind it, with our eyes  just over the edge.  The man was not twenty yards off, and I could see  clearly what manner of fellow he was.  For one thing he was huge of  size, or so he seemed to me in the half-light.  He wore nothing but a  shirt and trousers, and I could hear by the flap of his feet on the  sand that he was barefoot.    Suddenly Tam Dyke gave a gasp of astonishment.  'Gosh, it's the black  minister!' he said.    It was indeed a black man, as we saw when the moon came out of a cloud.  His head was on his breast, and he walked round the fire with measured,  regular steps.  At intervals he would stop and raise both hands to the  sky, and bend his body in the direction of the moon.  But he never  uttered a word.    'It's magic,' said Archie.  'He's going to raise Satan.  We must bide  here and see what happens, for he'll grip us if we try to go back.  The  moon's ower high.'    The procession continued as if to some slow music.  I had been in no  fear of the adventure back there by our cave; but now that I saw the  thing from close at hand, my courage began to ebb.  There was something  desperately uncanny about this great negro, who had shed his clerical  garments, and was now practising some strange magic alone by the sea.  I had no doubt it was the black art, for there was that in the air and  the scene which spelled the unlawful.  As we watched, the circles  stopped, and the man threw something on the fire.  A thick smoke rose  of which we could feel the aromatic scent, and when it was gone the  flame burned with a silvery blueness like moonlight.  Still no sound  came from the minister, but he took something from his belt, and began  to make odd markings in the sand between the inner circle and the fire.  As he turned, the moon gleamed on the implement, and we saw it was a  great knife.    We were now scared in real earnest.  Here were we, three boys, at night  in a lonely place a few yards from a savage with a knife. The adventure  was far past my liking, and even the intrepid Archie was having qualms,  if I could judge from his set face. As for Tam, his teeth were  chattering like a threshing-mill.    Suddenly I felt something soft and warm on the rock at my right hand.  I felt again, and, lo! it was the man's clothes. There were his boots  and socks, his minister's coat and his minister's hat.    This made the predicament worse, for if we waited till he finished his  rites we should for certain be found by him.  At the same time, to  return over the boulders in the bright moonlight seemed an equally sure  way to discovery.  I whispered to Archie, who was for waiting a little  longer.  'Something may turn up,' he said.  It was always his way.    I do not know what would have turned up, for we had no chance of  testing it.  The situation had proved too much for the nerves of Tam  Dyke.  As the man turned towards us in his bowings and bendings, Tam  suddenly sprang to his feet and shouted at him a piece of schoolboy  rudeness then fashionable in Kirkcaple.    'Wha called ye partan-face, my bonny man?'  Then, clutching his  lantern, he ran for dear life, while Archie and I raced at his heels.  As I turned I had a glimpse of a huge figure, knife in hand, bounding  towards us.    Though I only saw it in the turn of a head, the face stamped itself  indelibly upon my mind.  It was black, black as ebony, but it was  different from the ordinary negro.  There were no thick lips and flat  nostrils; rather, if I could trust my eyes, the nose was high-bridged,  and the lines of the mouth sharp and firm.  But it was distorted into  an expression of such a devilish fury and amazement that my heart  became like water.    We had a start, as I have said, of some twenty or thirty yards.  Among  the boulders we were not at a great disadvantage, for a boy can flit  quickly over them, while a grown man must pick his way.  Archie, as  ever, kept his wits the best of us. 'Make straight for the burn,' he  shouted in a hoarse whisper; we'll beat him on the slope.'    We passed the boulders and slithered over the outcrop of red rock and  the patches of sea-pink till we reached the channel of the Dyve water,  which flows gently among pebbles after leaving the gully.  Here for the  first time I looked back and saw nothing.  I stopped involuntarily, and  that halt was nearly my undoing.  For our pursuer had reached the burn  before us, but lower down, and was coming up its bank to cut us off.    At most times I am a notable coward, and in these days I was still more  of one, owing to a quick and easily-heated imagination.  But now I  think I did a brave thing, though more by instinct than resolution.  Archie was running first, and had already splashed through the burn;  Tam came next, just about to cross, and the black man was almost at his  elbow.  Another second and Tam would have been in his clutches had I  not yelled out a warning and made straight up the bank of the burn.  Tam fell into the pool--I could hear his spluttering cry--but he got  across; for I heard Archie call to him, and the two vanished into the  thicket which clothes all the left bank of the gully.  The pursuer,  seeing me on his own side of the water, followed straight on; and  before I knew it had become a race between the two of us.    I was hideously frightened, but not without hope, for the screes and  shelves of this right side of the gully were known to me from many a  day's exploring.  I was light on my feet and uncommonly sound in wind,  being by far the best long-distance runner in Kirkcaple.  If I could  only keep my lead till I reached a certain corner I knew of, I could  outwit my enemy; for it was possible from that place to make a detour  behind a waterfall and get into a secret path of ours among the bushes.  I flew up the steep screes, not daring to look round; but at the top,  where the rocks begin, I had a glimpse of my pursuer. The man could  run.

Good bye, gentlemen.'    \"Well, one of the critters, who was as awkward as a wrong boot, soon  calls out, 'woh,' to me, so I turns and sais 'well, \"old hoss,\" what  do you want?' At which they laughed louder than before.    \"Sais he, 'we have concluded to take your offer.'    \"'Well,' sais I, 'there is no back out in me, here is your money, the  knees is mine.' So I shipped them, and had the satisfaction to oblige  them, and put two hundred and fifty pounds in my pocket. There are  three things, Squire, I like in a spekelation:--First. A fair shake;  Second. A fair profit; and Third, a fair share of fun.\"    In the course of the afternoon, he said, \"Squire, I have brought you  my Journal, for I thought when I was a startin' off, as there were  some things I should like to point out to my old friend, it would be  as well to deliver it myself and mention them, for what in natur' is  the good of letter writing? In business there is nothing like a good  face to face talk. Now, Squire, I am really what I assume to be--I am,  in fact, Sam Slick the Clockmaker, and nobody else. It is of no  consequence however to the world whether this is really my name or an  assumed one. If it is the first, it is a matter of some importance to  take care of it and defend it; if it is a fictitious one, it is  equally so to preserve my incognito. I may not choose to give my card,  and may not desire to be known. A satirist, like an Irishman, finds it  convenient sometimes to shoot from behind a shelter. Like him, too, he  may occasionally miss his shot, and firing with intent to do bodily  harm is almost as badly punished as if death had ensued. And besides,  an anonymous book has a mystery about it. Moreover, what more right  has a man to say to you, 'Stand and deliver your name,' than to say,  'Stand and fork out your purse'--I can't see the difference for the  life of me. Hesitation betrays guilt. If a person inquires if you are  to home, the servant is directed to say No, if you don't want to be  seen, and choose to be among the missing. Well, if a feller asks if I  am the Mr Slick, I have just as good a right to say, 'Ask about and  find out.'    \"People sometimes, I actilly believe, take you for me. If they do, all  I have to say is they are fools not to know better, for we neither act  alike, talk alike, nor look alike, though perhaps we may think alike  on some subjects. You was bred and born here in Nova Scotia, and not  in Connecticut, and if they ask you where I was raised, tell them I  warn't raised at all, but was found one fine morning pinned across a  clothes line, after a heavy washing to hum. It is easy to distinguish  an editor from the author, if a reader has half an eye, and if he  hain't got that, it's no use to offer him spectacles, that's a fact.  Now, by trade I am a clockmaker, and by birth I have the honour to be  a Yankee. I use the word honour, Squire, a purpose, because I know  what I am talking about, which I am sorry to say is not quite so  common a thing in the world as people suppose. The English call all us  Americans, Yankees, because they don't know what they are talking  about, and are not aware that it is only the inhabitants of New  England who can boast of that appellation.1      1 Brother Jonathan is the general term for all. It originated thus.  When General Washington, after being appointed commander of the army  of the Revolutionary War, came to Massachusetts to organize it, and  make preparations for the defence of the country, he found a great  want of ammunition and other means necessary to meet the powerful foe  he had to contend with, and great difficulty to obtain them. If  attacked in such condition, the cause at once might be hopeless. On  one occasion at that anxious period, a consultation of the officers  and others was had, when it seemed no way could be devised to make  such preparations as was necessary. His Excellency Jonathan Trumbull,  the elder, was then Governor of the State of Connecticut, on whose  judgment and aid the General placed the greatest reliance, and  remarked, \"We must consult 'Brother Jonathan' on the subject. The  General did so, and the Governor was successful in supplying many of  the wants of the army. When difficulties arose, and the army was  spread over the country, it became a by-word, \"We must consult Brother  Jonathan.\" The term Yankee is still applied to a portion, but \"Brother  Jonathan\" has now become a designation of the whole country, as John  Bull is for England.--BARTLETT'S AMERICANISMS.      \"The southerners, who are both as proud and as sarcy as the British,  call us Eastern folk Yankees as a term of reproach, because having no  slaves, we are obliged to be our own niggers and do our own work,  which is'nt considered very genteel, and as we are intelligent,  enterprising, and skilful, and therefore too often creditors of our  more luxurious countrymen, they do not like us the better for that,  and not being Puritans themselves, are apt to style us scornfully,  those 'd--d Yankees.'    \"Now all this comes of their not knowing what they are talking about.  Even the New Englanders themselves, cute as they be, often use the  word foolishly; for, Squire, would you believe it, none of them,  though they answer to and acknowledge the appellation of Yankee with  pride, can tell you its origin. I repeat, therefore, I have the honour  to be a Yankee. I don't mean to say that word is 'all same,' as the  Indians say, as perfection; far from it, for we have some  peculiarities common to us all. Cracking and boasting is one of these.  Now braggin' comes as natural to me as scratchin' to a Scotchman. I am  as fond of rubbing myself agin the statue of George the Third, as he  is of se-sawing his shoulders on the mile-stones of the Duke of  Argyle. Each in their way were great benefactors, the one by teaching  the Yankees to respect themselves, and the other by putting his  countrymen in an upright posture of happiness. So I can join hands  with the North Briton, and bless them both.    \"With this national and nateral infirmity therefore, is it to be  wondered at if, as my 'Sayings and Doings' have become more popular  than you or I ever expected, that I should crack and boast of them? I  think not. If I have a claim, my role is to go ahead with it. Now  don't leave out my braggin', Squire, because you are afraid people  will think it is you speaking, and not me, or because you think it is  bad taste as you call it. I know what I am at, and don't go it--blind.  My Journal contains much for my own countrymen as well as the English,  for we expect every American abroad to sustain the reputation in  himself of our great nation.    \"Now our Minister to Victoria's Court, when he made his brag speech to  the great agricultural dinner at Gloucester last year, didn't intend  that for the British, but for us. So in Congress no man in either  house can speak or read an oration more than an hour long, but he can  send the whole lockrum, includin' what he didn't say, to the papers.  One has to brag before foreign assemblies, the other before a  Congress, but both have an eye to the feelings of the Americans at  large, and their own constituents in particular. Now that is a trick  others know as well as we do. The Irish member from Kilmany, and him  from Kilmore, when he brags there never was a murder in either, don't  expect the English to believe it, for he is availed they know better,  but the brag pleases the patriots to home, on account of its  impudence.    \"So the little man, Lord Bunkum, when he opens Oxford to Jew and  Gentile, and offers to make Rothschild Chancellor instead of Lord  Derby, and tells them old dons, the heads of colleges, as polite as a  stage-driver, that he does it out of pure regard to them, and only to  improve the University, don't expect them to believe it; for he gives  them a sly wink when he says so, as much as to say, how are you off  for Hebrew, my old septuagenarians? Droll boy is Rothey, for though he  comes from the land of Ham, he don't eat pork. But it pleases the  sarcumsised Jew, and the unsarcumsised tag-rag and bobtail that are to  be admitted, and who verily do believe (for their bump of conceit is  largely developed) that they can improve the Colleges by granting  educational excursion tickets.    \"So Paddy O'Shonnosey the member for Blarney, when he votes for  smashing in the porter's lodges of that Protestant institution, and  talks of Toleration and Equal Rights, and calls the Duke of Tuscany a  broth of a boy, and a light to illumine heretical darkness, don't talk  this nonsense to please the outs or ins, for he don't care a snap of  his finger for either of them, nor because he thinks it right, for  it's plain he don't, seeing that he would fight till he'd run away  before Maynooth should be sarved arter that fashion; but he does it,  because he knows it will please him, or them, that sent him there.    \"There are two kinds of boastin', Squire, active and passive. The  former belongs exclusively to my countrymen, and the latter to the  British. A Yankee openly asserts and loudly proclaims his superiority.  John Bull feels and looks it. He don't give utterance to this  conviction. He takes it for granted all the world knows and admits it,  and he is so thoroughly persuaded of it himself, that, to use his own  favourite phrase, he don't care a fig if folks don't admit it. His  vanity, therefore, has a sublimity in it. He thinks, as the Italians  say, 'that when nature formed him, she broke the mould.' There never  was, never can, and never will be, another like him. His boastin',  therefore, is passive. He shows it and acts it; but he don't proclaim  it. He condescends and is gracious, patronizes and talks down to you.  Let my boastin' alone therefore, Squire, if you please. You know what  it means, what bottom it has, and whether the plaster sticks on the  right spot"]]]
