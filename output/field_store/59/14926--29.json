I threaded my way through the silent throng  of spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of police. A  regiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow square round  the Lethal Chamber. On a raised tribune facing Washington Park stood the  Governor of New York, and behind him were grouped the Mayor of New  York and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant of  the state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to the President of the  United States, General Blount, commanding at Governor's Island,  Major-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of New York and Brooklyn,  Admiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River, Surgeon-General  Lanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital, Senators Wyse and  Franklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The tribune  was surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.    The Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the  Surgeon-General. I heard him say: \"The laws prohibiting suicide and  providing punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been  repealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to  end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through  physical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community  will be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since  the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has  not increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal  Chamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be  seen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding  ranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief  thus provided.\" He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The  silence in the street was absolute. \"There a painless death awaits him  who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let  him seek it there.\" Then quickly turning to the military aid of the  President's household, he said, \"I declare the Lethal Chamber open,\" and  again facing the vast crowd he cried in a clear voice: \"Citizens of New  York and of the United States of America, through me the Government  declares the Lethal Chamber to be open.\"    The solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of  hussars filed after the Governor's carriage, the lancers wheeled and  formed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison, and  the mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and stare at  the white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked  along the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street. Then I  turned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign:    HAWBERK, ARMOURER.    I glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at  the end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his  deep, hearty voice, \"Come in, Mr. Castaigne!\" Constance, his daughter,  rose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her pretty  hand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and knew  that it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis. I  smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was  embroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn  greaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his  little hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he  dropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench.  The soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I  loved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow  shock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour.  That was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested  me personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in  love with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept  me awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come right,  and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of  my kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have troubled  myself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that  the music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination. I  would sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam  struck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen  to endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that  stretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some movement of the  old armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still thrilling  secretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the  polishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.    Constance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing  to examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the  Metropolitan Museum.    \"Who is this for?\" I asked.    Hawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the  Metropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also  had charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was the  missing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a  little shop in Paris on the Quai d'Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated for  and secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down his  hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner  to owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his superb  collection was sold, this client of Hawberk's bought the suit, and since  then the search for the missing greave had been pushed until it was,  almost by accident, located in Paris.    \"Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the  greave being still in existence?\" I demanded.    \"Of course,\" he replied coolly.    Then for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.    \"It was worth something to you,\" I ventured.    \"No,\" he replied, laughing, \"my pleasure in finding it was my reward.\"    \"Have you no ambition to be rich?\" I asked, smiling.    \"My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world,\" he answered  gravely.    Constance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber.  She herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and had  wished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner  finished, and she had stayed at his request.    \"Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?\" she asked, with the  slightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.    \"No,\" I replied carelessly. \"Louis' regiment is manoeuvring out in  Westchester County.\" I rose and picked up my hat and cane.    \"Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?\" laughed old Hawberk.  If Hawberk knew how I loathe that word \"lunatic,\" he would never use it  in my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care  to explain. However, I answered him quietly: \"I think I shall drop in and  see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two.\"    \"Poor fellow,\" said Constance, with a shake of the head, \"it must be hard  to live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented. It is  very good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do.\"    \"I think he is vicious,\" observed Hawberk, beginning again with his  hammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had  finished I replied:    \"No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a  wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would  give years of our life to acquire.\"'    Hawberk laughed.    I continued a little impatiently: \"He knows history as no one else could  know it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is  so absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that  such a man existed, the people could not honour him enough.\"    \"Nonsense,\" muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.    \"Is it nonsense,\" I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, \"is it  nonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled  suit of armour commonly known as the 'Prince's Emblazoned' can be found  among a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and  ragpicker's refuse in a garret in Pell Street?\"    Hawberk's hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with  a great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were  missing from the \"Prince's Emblazoned.\"    \"I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He said  they were in the garret of 998 Pell Street.\"    \"Nonsense,\" he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern  apron.    \"Is this nonsense too?\" I asked pleasantly, \"is it nonsense when Mr.  Wilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss  Constance--\"    I did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror  written on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his  leathern apron.    \"That is impossible,\" he observed, \"Mr. Wilde may know a great many  things--\"    \"About armour, for instance, and the 'Prince's Emblazoned,'\" I  interposed, smiling.    \"Yes,\" he continued, slowly, \"about armour also--may be--but he is wrong  in regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed his  wife's traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not long  survive his wife.\"    \"Mr. Wilde is wrong,\" murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but her  voice was sweet and calm.    \"Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is  wrong,\" I said.          II    I climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often  climbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor.  Mr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.    When he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#2)"],[1,"    Though her judgment told her that all would be well were her Tarzan to  go alone in accordance with the mysterious stranger's summons, her  intuition would not permit her to lay aside suspicion of the gravest  dangers to both her husband and her son.    The more she thought of the matter, the more convinced she became that  the recent telephone message might be but a ruse to keep them inactive  until the boy was safely hidden away or spirited out of England.  Or it  might be that it had been simply a bait to lure Tarzan into the hands  of the implacable Rokoff.    With the lodgment of this thought she stopped in wide-eyed terror.  Instantly it became a conviction.  She glanced at the great clock  ticking the minutes in the corner of the library.    It was too late to catch the Dover train that Tarzan was to take.  There was another, later, however, that would bring her to the Channel  port in time to reach the address the stranger had given her husband  before the appointed hour.    Summoning her maid and chauffeur, she issued instructions rapidly.  Ten  minutes later she was being whisked through the crowded streets toward  the railway station.    It was nine-forty-five that night that Tarzan entered the squalid \"pub\"  on the water-front in Dover.  As he passed into the evil-smelling room  a muffled figure brushed past him toward the street.    \"Come, my lord!\" whispered the stranger.    The ape-man wheeled about and followed the other into the ill-lit  alley, which custom had dignified with the title of thoroughfare.  Once  outside, the fellow led the way into the darkness, nearer a wharf,  where high-piled bales, boxes, and casks cast dense shadows.  Here he  halted.    \"Where is the boy?\" asked Greystoke.    \"On that small steamer whose lights you can just see yonder,\" replied  the other.    In the gloom Tarzan was trying to peer into the features of his  companion, but he did not recognize the man as one whom he had ever  before seen.  Had he guessed that his guide was Alexis Paulvitch he  would have realized that naught but treachery lay in the man's heart,  and that danger lurked in the path of every move.    \"He is unguarded now,\" continued the Russian.  \"Those who took him feel  perfectly safe from detection, and with the exception of a couple of  members of the crew, whom I have furnished with enough gin to silence  them effectually for hours, there is none aboard the Kincaid.  We can  go aboard, get the child, and return without the slightest fear.\"    Tarzan nodded.    \"Let's be about it, then,\" he said.    His guide led him to a small boat moored alongside the wharf.   The two  men entered, and Paulvitch pulled rapidly toward the steamer.  The  black smoke issuing from her funnel did not at the time make any  suggestion to Tarzan's mind.  All his thoughts were occupied with the  hope that in a few moments he would again have his little son in his  arms.    At the steamer's side they found a monkey-ladder dangling close above  them, and up this the two men crept stealthily.   Once on deck they  hastened aft to where the Russian pointed to a hatch.    \"The boy is hidden there,\" he said.  \"You had better go down after him,  as there is less chance that he will cry in fright than should he find  himself in the arms of a stranger.   I will stand on guard here.\"    So anxious was Tarzan to rescue the child that he gave not the  slightest thought to the strangeness of all the conditions surrounding  the Kincaid.  That her deck was deserted, though she had steam up, and  from the volume of smoke pouring from her funnel was all ready to get  under way made no impression upon him.    With the thought that in another instant he would fold that precious  little bundle of humanity in his arms, the ape-man swung down into the  darkness below.  Scarcely had he released his hold upon the edge of the  hatch than the heavy covering fell clattering above him.    Instantly he knew that he was the victim of a plot, and that far from  rescuing his son he had himself fallen into the hands of his enemies.  Though he immediately endeavoured to reach the hatch and lift the  cover, he was unable to do so.    Striking a match, he explored his surroundings, finding that a little  compartment had been partitioned off from the main hold, with the hatch  above his head the only means of ingress or egress.  It was evident  that the room had been prepared for the very purpose of serving as a  cell for himself.    There was nothing in the compartment, and no other occupant.   If the  child was on board the Kincaid he was confined elsewhere.    For over twenty years, from infancy to manhood, the ape-man had roamed  his savage jungle haunts without human companionship of any nature.  He  had learned at the most impressionable period of his life to take his  pleasures and his sorrows as the beasts take theirs.    So it was that he neither raved nor stormed against fate, but instead  waited patiently for what might next befall him, though not by any  means without an eye to doing the utmost to succour himself.  To this  end he examined his prison carefully, tested the heavy planking that  formed its walls, and measured the distance of the hatch above him.    And while he was thus occupied there came suddenly to him the vibration  of machinery and the throbbing of the propeller.    The ship was moving!  Where to and to what fate was it carrying him?    And even as these thoughts passed through his mind there came to his  ears above the din of the engines that which caused him to go cold with  apprehension.    Clear and shrill from the deck above him rang the scream of a  frightened woman.          Chapter 2    Marooned      As Tarzan and his guide had disappeared into the shadows upon the dark  wharf the figure of a heavily veiled woman had hurried down the narrow  alley to the entrance of the drinking-place the two men had just  quitted.    Here she paused and looked about, and then as though satisfied that she  had at last reached the place she sought, she pushed bravely into the  interior of the vile den.    A score of half-drunken sailors and wharf-rats looked up at the  unaccustomed sight of a richly gowned woman in their midst.   Rapidly  she approached the slovenly barmaid who stared half in envy, half in  hate, at her more fortunate sister.    \"Have you seen a tall, well-dressed man here, but a minute since,\" she  asked, \"who met another and went away with him?\"    The girl answered in the affirmative, but could not tell which way the  two had gone.  A sailor who had approached to listen to the  conversation vouchsafed the information that a moment before as he had  been about to enter the \"pub\" he had seen two men leaving it who walked  toward the wharf.    \"Show me the direction they went,\" cried the woman, slipping a coin  into the man's hand.    The fellow led her from the place, and together they walked quickly  toward the wharf and along it until across the water they saw a small  boat just pulling into the shadows of a near-by steamer.    \"There they be,\" whispered the man.    \"Ten pounds if you will find a boat and row me to that steamer,\" cried  the woman.    \"Quick, then,\" he replied, \"for we gotta go it if we're goin' to catch  the Kincaid afore she sails.  She's had steam up for three hours an'  jest been a-waitin' fer that one passenger.   I was a-talkin' to one of  her crew 'arf an hour ago.\"    As he spoke he led the way to the end of the wharf where he knew  another boat lay moored, and, lowering the woman into it, he jumped in  after and pushed off.  The two were soon scudding over the water.    At the steamer's side the man demanded his pay and, without waiting to  count out the exact amount, the woman thrust a handful of bank-notes  into his outstretched hand.  A single glance at them convinced the  fellow that he had been more than well paid.  Then he assisted her up  the ladder, holding his skiff close to the ship's side against the  chance that this profitable passenger might wish to be taken ashore  later.    But presently the sound of the donkey engine and the rattle of a steel  cable on the hoisting-drum proclaimed the fact that the Kincaid's  anchor was being raised, and a moment later the waiter heard the  propellers revolving, and slowly the little steamer moved away from him  out into the channel.    As he turned to row back to shore he heard a woman's shriek from the  ship's deck.    \"That's wot I calls rotten luck,\" he soliloquized.  \"I might jest as  well of 'ad the whole bloomin' wad.\"      When Jane Clayton climbed to the deck of the Kincaid she found the ship  apparently deserted.  There was no sign of those she sought nor of any  other aboard, and so she went about her search for her husband and the  child she hoped against hope to find there without interruption.    Quickly she hastened to the cabin, which was half above and half below  deck.  As she hurried down the short companion-ladder into the main  cabin, on either side of which were the smaller rooms occupied by the  officers, she failed to note the quick closing of one of the doors  before her.  She passed the full length of the main room, and then  retracing her steps stopped before each door to listen, furtively  trying each latch.    All was silence, utter silence there, in which the throbbing of her own  frightened heart seemed to her overwrought imagination to fill the ship  with its thunderous alarm.    One by one the doors opened before her touch, only to reveal empty  interiors.  In her absorption she did not note the sudden activity upon  the vessel, the purring of the engines, the throbbing of the propeller.  She had reached the last door upon the right now, and as she pushed it  open she was seized from within by a powerful, dark-visaged man, and  drawn hastily into the stuffy, ill-smelling interior.    The sudden shock of fright which the unexpected attack had upon her  drew a single piercing scream from her throat;"]]]
