[FN [u] Chron. Sax. p. 65.  W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4  Ethelward, lib.  4. cap. 4.  Ingulph. p. 26.]    Alfred lay here concealed, but not inactive, during a twelvemonth,  when the news of a prosperous event reached his ears, and called him  to the field.  Hubba, the Dane, having spread devastation, fire, and  slaughter over Wales, had landed in Devonshire from twenty-three  vessels, and laid siege to the castle of Kenwith, a place situated  near the mouth of the small river Tau.  Oddune, Earl of Devonshire,  with his followers, had taken shelter there; and being ill supplied  with provisions, and even with water, he determined, by some vigorous  blow, to prevent the necessity of submitting to the barbarous enemy.  He made a sudden sally on the Danes before sun-rising; and taking them  unprepared, he put them to rout, pursued them with great slaughter,  killed Hubba himself; and got possession of the famous REAFEN, or  enchanted standard, in which the Danes put great confidence [w].  It  contained the figure of a raven, which had been inwoven by the three  sisters of Hinguar and Hubba, with many magical incantations, and  which, by its different movements, prognosticated, as the Danes  believed, the good or bad success of any enterprise [x].  [FN [w] Asser. p. 10.  Chron. Sax. p. 84.  Abbas Rieval, p. 395  Alured Beverl. p. 105.  [x] Asser. p. 10.]    When Alfred observed this symptom of successful resistance in his  subjects, he left his retreat; but before he would assemble them in  arms, or urge them to any attempt, which, if unfortunate, might, in  their present despondency, prove fatal, he resolved to inspect himself  the situation of the enemy, and to judge of the probability of  success.  For this purpose he entered their camp under the disguise of  a harper, and passed unsuspected through every quarter.  He so  entertained them with his music and facetious humours, that he met  with a welcome reception; and was even introduced to the tent of  Guthrum, their prince, where he remained some days [y].  He remarked  the supine security of the Danes, their contempt of the English, their  negligence in foraging and plundering, and their dissolute wasting of  what they gained by rapine and violence.  Encouraged by these  favourable appearances, he secretly sent emissaries to the most  considerable of his subjects, and summoned them to a rendezvous,  attended by their warlike followers, at Brixton, on the borders of  Selwood forest [z].  The English, who had hoped to put an end to their  calamities by servile submission, now found the insolence and rapine  of the conqueror more intolerable than all past fatigues and dangers;  and, at the appointed day, they joyfully resorted to their prince.  On  his appearance, they received him with shouts of applause [a]; and  could not satiate their eyes with the sight of this beloved monarch,  whom they had long regarded as dead, and who now, with voice and looks  expressing his confidence of success, called them to liberty and to  vengeance.  He instantly conducted them to Eddington, where the Danes  were encamped; and taking advantage of his previous knowledge of the  place, he directed his attack against the most unguarded quarter of  the enemy.  The Danes, surprised to see an army of English, whom they  considered as totally subdued, and still more astonished to hear that  Alfred was at their head, made but a faint resistance, notwithstanding  their superiority of number, and were soon put to flight with great  slaughter.  The remainder of the routed army, with their prince, was  besieged by Alfred in a fortified camp to which they fled; but being  reduced to extremity by want and hunger, they had recourse to the  clemency of the victor, and offered to submit on any conditions.  The  king, no less generous than brave, gave them their lives; and even  formed a scheme for converting them from mortal enemies into faithful  subjects and confederates.  He knew that the kingdoms of East Anglia  and Northumberland were totally desolated by the frequent inroads of  the Danes, and he now proposed to repeople them, by settling there  Guthrum and his followers.  He hoped that the new planters would at  last betake themselves to industry, when, by reason of his resistance,  and the exhausted condition of the country, they could no longer  subsist by plunder; and that they might serve him as a rampart against  any future incursions of their countrymen.  But before he ratified  these mild conditions with the Danes, he required that they should  give him one pledge of their submission, and of their inclination to  incorporate with the English, by declaring their conversion to  Christianity [b].  Guthrum and his army had no aversion to the  proposal; and without much instruction, or argument, or conference,  they were all admitted to baptism.  The king answered for Guthrum at  the font, gave him the name of Athelstan, and received him as his  adopted son [c].  [FN [y] W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4.  [z] Chron. Sax. p. 85.  [a] Asser.  p. 10.  Chron. Sax. p. 85.  Simeon Dunelm. p. 128.  Alured Beverl. p.  105.  Abbas Rieval, p. 354.  [b] Chron. Sax. p. 85.  [c] Asser. p. 10.  Chron. Sax. p. 90.]    [MN 880.] The success of the expedient seemed to correspond to  Alfred's hopes: the greater part of the Danes settled peaceably in  their new quarters: some smaller bodies of the same nation, which were  dispersed in Mercia, were distributed into the five cities of Derby,  Leicester, Stamford, Lincoln, and Nottingham, and were thence called  the Fif or Five-burghers.  The more turbulent and unquiet made an  expedition into France, under the command of Hastings [d]; and, except  by a short incursion of Danes, who sailed up the Thames, and landed at  Fulham, but suddenly retreated to their ships on finding the country  in a posture of defence, Alfred was not for some years infested by the  inroads of those barbarians [e].  [FN [d] W. Malm. lib. 2. c. 4.  Ingulph. p. 26.  [e] Asser. p. 11.]    The king employed this interval of tranquillity in restoring order to  the state, which had been shaken by so many violent convulsions; in  establishing civil and military institutions; in composing the minds  of men to industry and justice; and in providing against the return of  like calamities.  He was, more properly than his grandfather, Egbert,  the sole monarch of the English, (for so the Saxons were now  universally called,) because the kingdom of Mercia was at last  incorporated in his state, and was governed by Ethelbert, his brother-  in-law, who bore the title of Earl: and though the Danes, who peopled  East Anglia and Northumberland, were for some time ruled immediately  by their own princes, they all acknowledged a subordination to Alfred,  and submitted to his superior authority.  As equality among subjects  is the great source of concord, Alfred gave the same laws to the Danes  and English, and put them entirely on a like footing in the  administration both of civil and criminal justice.  The fine for the  murder of a Dane was the same with that for the murder of an  Englishman; the great symbol of equality in those ages.    The king, after rebuilding the ruined cities, particularly London [f],  which had been destroyed by the Danes in the reign of Ethelwolf,  established a regular militia for the defence of the kingdom.  He  ordained that all his people should be armed and registered; he  assigned them a regular rotation of duty; he distributed part into the  castles and fortresses which he built at proper places [g]; he  required another part to take the field on any alarm, and to assemble  at stated places of rendezvous; and he left a sufficient number at  home, who were employed in the cultivation of the land, and who  afterwards took their turn in military service [h].  The whole kingdom  was like one great garrison; and the Danes could no sooner appear in  one place, than a sufficient number was assembled to oppose them,  without leaving the other quarters defenceless or disarmed [i].  [FN [f] Asser. p. 15.  Chron. Sax. p. 88.  M. West. p. 171.  Simeon  Dunelm. p. 131.  Brompton, p. 812.  Alured Beverl. ex edit. Hearne, p.  106.  [g] Asser. p. 18.  Ingulph. p. 27.  [h] Chron. Sax. p. 92, 93.  [i] Spellman's Life of Alfred, p. 147. edit. 1709.]    But Alfred, sensible that the proper method of opposing an enemy who  made incursions by sea, was to meet them on their own element, took  care to provide himself with a naval force [k], which though the most  natural defence of an island, had hitherto been totally neglected by  the English.  He increased the shipping of his kingdom both in number  and strength, and trained his subjects in the practice, as well of  sailing as of naval action.  He distributed his armed vessels in  proper stations around the island, and was sure to meet the Danish  ships either before or after they had landed their troops, and to  pursue them in all their incursions.  Though the Danes might suddenly,  by surprise, disembark on the coast, which was generally become  desolate by their frequent ravages, they were encountered by the  English fleet in their retreat; and escaped not, as formerly, by  abandoning their booty, but paid, by their total destruction, the  penalty of the disorders which they had committed.  [FN [k] Asser. p. 9.  M. West. p. 179.]    In this manner Alfred repelled several inroads of these piratical  Danes, and maintained his kingdom, during some years, in safety and  tranquillity.  A fleet of a hundred and twenty ships of war was  stationed upon the coast; and being provided with warlike engines, as  well as with expert seamen, both Frisians and English, (for Alfred  supplied the defects of his own subjects by engaging able foreigners  in his service,) maintained a superiority over these smaller bands  with which England had so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#20)"],[1,"  _Note one_: Interview the groundsman on this point.    In the second place Adair might have upset the tin and trodden in its  contents when he went to get his bicycle in order to fetch the doctor  for the suffering MacPhee. This was the more probable of the two  contingencies, for it would have been dark in the shed when Adair  went into it.    _Note two_: Interview Adair as to whether he found, on returning to the  house, that there was paint on his shoes.    Things were moving.           *       *       *       *       *    He resolved to take Adair first. He could get the groundsman's address  from him.    Passing by the trees under whose shade Mike and Psmith and Dunster had  watched the match on the previous day, he came upon the Head of his  house in a deck chair reading a book. A summer Sunday afternoon is the  time for reading in deck chairs.    \"Oh, Adair,\" he said. \"No, don't get up. I merely wished to ask you if  you found any paint on your shoes when you returned to the house  last night.\"    \"Paint, sir?\" Adair was plainly puzzled. His book had been interesting,  and had driven the Sammy incident out of his head.    \"I see somebody has spilled some paint on the floor of the bicycle shed.  You did not do that, I suppose, when you went to fetch your bicycle?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"It is spilled all over the floor. I wondered whether you had happened  to tread in it. But you say you found no paint on your shoes  this morning?\"    \"No, sir, my bicycle is always quite near the door of the shed. I didn't  go into the shed at all.\"    \"I see. Quite so. Thank you, Adair. Oh, by the way, Adair, where does  Markby live?\"    \"I forget the name of his cottage, sir, but I could show you in a  second. It's one of those cottages just past the school gates, on the  right as you turn out into the road. There are three in a row. His is  the first you come to. There's a barn just before you get to them.\"    \"Thank you. I shall be able to find them. I should like to speak to  Markby for a moment on a small matter.\"    A sharp walk took him to the cottages Adair had mentioned. He rapped at  the door of the first, and the groundsman came out in his shirt sleeves,  blinking as if he had just waked up, as was indeed the case.    \"Oh, Markby!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"You remember that you were painting the scoring box in the pavilion  last night after the match?\"    \"Yes, sir. It wanted a lick of paint bad. The young gentlemen will  scramble about and get through the window. Makes it look shabby, sir. So  I thought I'd better give it a coating so as to look shipshape when the  Marylebone come down.\"    \"Just so. An excellent idea. Tell me, Markby, what did you do with the  pot of paint when you had finished?\"    \"Put it in the bicycle shed, sir.\"    \"On the floor?\"    \"On the floor, sir? No. On the shelf at the far end, with the can of  whitening what I use for marking out the wickets, sir.\"    \"Of course, yes. Quite so. Just as I thought.\"    \"Do you want it, sir?\"    \"No, thank you, Markby, no, thank you. The fact is, somebody who had no  business to do so has moved the pot of paint from the shelf to the  floor, with the result that it has been kicked over and spilled. You had  better get some more tomorrow. Thank you, Markby. That is all I  wished to know.\"    Mr. Downing walked back to the school thoroughly excited. He was hot on  the scent now. The only other possible theories had been tested and  successfully exploded. The thing had become simple to a degree. All he  had to do was to go to Mr. Outwood's house--the idea of searching a  fellow master's house did not appear to him at all a delicate task;  somehow one grew unconsciously to feel that Mr. Outwood did not really  exist as a man capable of resenting liberties--find the paint-splashed  shoe, ascertain its owner, and denounce him to the headmaster. There  could be no doubt that a paint-splashed shoe must be in Mr. Outwood's  house somewhere. A boy cannot tread in a pool of paint without showing  some signs of having done so. It was Sunday, too, so that the shoe would  not yet have been cleaned. Yoicks! Also tally-ho! This really was  beginning to be something like business.    Regardless of the heat, the sleuth-hound hurried across to Outwood's as  fast as he could walk.        20    A CHECK      The only two members of the house not out in the grounds when he arrived  were Mike and Psmith. They were standing on the gravel drive in front of  the boys' entrance. Mike had a deck chair in one hand and a book in the  other. Psmith--for even the greatest minds will sometimes unbend--was  wrestling with a Yo-Yo. That is to say, he was trying without success to  keep the spool spinning. He smoothed a crease out of his waistcoat and  tried again. He had just succeeded in getting the thing to spin when Mr.  Downing arrived. The sound of his footsteps disturbed Psmith and brought  the effort to nothing.    \"Enough of this spoolery,\" said he, flinging the spool through the open  window of the senior day room. \"I was an ass ever to try it. The  philosophical mind needs complete repose in its hours of  leisure. Hello!\"    He stared after the sleuth-hound, who had just entered the house.    \"What the dickens,\" said Mike, \"does he mean by barging in as if he'd  bought the place?\"    \"Comrade Downing looks pleased with himself. What brings him around in  this direction, I wonder! Still, no matter. The few articles which he  may sneak from our study are of inconsiderable value. He is welcome to  them. Do you feel inclined to wait awhile till I have fetched a chair  and book?\"    \"I'll be going on. I shall be under the trees at the far end of the  ground.\"    \"'Tis well. I will be with you in about two ticks.\"    Mike walked on toward the field, and Psmith, strolling upstairs to fetch  his novel, found Mr. Downing standing in the passage with the air of one  who has lost his bearings.    \"A warm afternoon, sir,\" murmured Psmith courteously, as he passed.    \"Er--Smith!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"I--er--wish to go round the dormitories.\"    It was Psmith's guiding rule in life never to be surprised at anything,  so he merely inclined his head gracefully, and said nothing.    \"I should be glad if you would fetch the keys and show me where the  rooms are.\"    \"With acute pleasure, sir,\" said Psmith. \"Or shall I fetch Mr. Outwood,  sir?\"    \"Do as I tell you Smith,\" snapped Mr. Downing.    Psmith said no more, but went down to the matron's room. The matron  being out, he abstracted the bunch of keys from her table and rejoined  the master.    \"Shall I lead the way, sir?\" he asked.    Mr. Downing nodded.    \"Here, sir,\" said Psmith, opening the door, \"we have Barnes's dormitory.  An airy room, constructed on the soundest hygienic principles. Each boy,  I understand, has quite a considerable number of cubic feet of air all  to himself. It is Mr. Outwood's boast that no boy has ever asked for a  cubic foot of air in vain. He argues justly--\"    He broke off abruptly and began to watch the other's maneuvers in  silence. Mr. Downing was peering rapidly beneath each bed in turn.    \"Are you looking for Barnes, sir?\" inquired Psmith politely. \"I think  he's out in the field.\"    Mr. Downing rose, having examined the last bed, crimson in the face with  the exercise.    \"Show me the next dormitory, Smith,\" he said, panting slightly.    \"This,\" said Psmith, opening the next door and sinking his voice to an  awed whisper, \"is where _I_ sleep!\"    Mr. Downing glanced swiftly beneath the three beds.    \"Excuse me, sir,\" said Psmith, \"but are we chasing anything?\"    \"Be good enough, Smith,\" said Mr. Downing with asperity, \"to keep your  remarks to yourself.\"    \"I was only wondering sir. Shall I show you the next in order?\"    \"Certainly.\"    They moved on up the passage.    Drawing blank at the last dormitory, Mr. Downing paused, baffled. Psmith  waited patiently by. An idea struck the master.    \"The studies, Smith,\" he cried.    \"Aha!\" said Psmith. \"I beg your pardon, sir. The observation escaped me  unawares. The frenzy of the chase is beginning to enter into my blood.  Here we have--\"    Mr. Downing stopped short.    \"Is this impertinence studied, Smith?\"    \"Ferguson's study, sir? No, sir. That's farther down the passage. This  is Barnes's.\"    Mr. Downing looked at him closely. Psmith's face was wooden in its  gravity. The master snorted suspiciously, then moved on.    \"Whose is this?\" he asked, rapping a door.    \"This, sir, is mine and Jackson's.\"    \"What! Have you a study? You are low down in the school for it.\"    \"I think, sir, that Mr. Outwood gave it us rather as a testimonial to  our general worth than to our proficiency in schoolwork.\"    Mr. Downing raked the room with a keen eye. The absence of bars from the  window attracted his attention.    \"Have you no bars to your windows here, such as there are in my house?\"    \"There appears to be no bar, sir,\" said Psmith, putting up his eyeglass.    Mr. Downing was leaning out of the window.    \"A lovely view, is it not, sir?\" said Psmith. \"The trees, the field, the  distant hills ...\"    Mr. Downing suddenly started. His eye had been caught by the water pipe  at the side of the window. The boy whom Sergeant Collard had seen  climbing the pipe must have been making for this study.    He spun around and met Psmith's blandly inquiring gaze. He looked at  Psmith carefully for a moment. No. The boy he had chased last night had  not been Psmith. That exquisite's figure and general appearance were  unmistakable, even in the dusk.    \"Whom did you say you shared this study with, Smith?\"    \"Jackson, sir. The cricketer.\"    \"Never mind about his cricket, Smith,\" said Mr. Downing with irritation.    \"No, sir.\"    \"He is the only other occupant of the room?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Nobody else comes into it?\"    \"If they do, they go out extremely quickly, sir.\"    \"Ah! Thank you, Smith.\"    \"Not at all, sir.\"    Mr. Downing pondered. Jackson! The boy bore him a grudge. "]]]
