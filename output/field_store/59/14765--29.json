Bobby Coon had found two traps set by Farmer  Brown's boy, and Billy Mink had almost stepped in a third. No one felt  safe any more, yet no one knew what to do. So they all waited for the  advice of Great-Grandfather Frog, who, you know, is accounted very, very  wise.    Grandfather Frog cleared his throat. \"Chugarum!\" said he. \"You must find  all the traps that Farmer Brown's boy has set.\"    \"How are we going to do it?\" asked Bobby Coon.    \"By looking for them,\" replied Grandfather Frog tartly.    Bobby Coon looked foolish and slipped out of sight behind his mother.    \"All the Coons and all the Minks must search along the banks of the  Laughing Brook, and all the Muskrats and all the Otters must search  along the banks of the Smiling Pool. You must use your eyes and your  noses. When you find things good to eat where you have never found them  before, watch out! When you get the first whiff of the man-smell, watch  out! Billy Mink, you are small and quick, and your eyes are sharp. You  sit here on the Big Rock until you see Farmer Brown's boy coming. Then  go hide in the bulrushes where you can watch him, but where he cannot  see you. Follow him everywhere he goes around the Smiling Pool or along  the Laughing Brook. Without knowing it, he will show you where every  trap is hidden.    \"When all the traps have been found, drop a stick or a stone in each.  That will spring them, and then they will be harmless. Then you can  bury them deep in the mud. But don't eat any of the food until you have  sprung all of the traps, for just as likely as not you will get caught.  When all the traps have been sprung, why not bring all the good things  to eat which you find around them to the Big Rock and have a grand  feast?\"    \"Hurrah for Grandfather Frog! That's a great idea!\" shouted Little Joe  Otter, turning a somersault in the water.    Every one agreed with Little Joe Otter, and immediately they began to  plan a grand hunt for the traps of Farmer Brown's boy. The Muskrats  and the Otters started to search the banks of the Smiling Pool, and  the Coons and the Minks, all but Billy, started for the Laughing Brook.  Billy climbed up on the Big Rock to watch, and Grandfather Frog slowly  swam back to his big green lily-pad to wait for some foolish green flies  for his breakfast.        CHAPTER V: A Busy Day At The Smiling Pool    Everybody was excited. Yes, Sir, everybody in the Smiling Pool and along  the Laughing Brook was just bubbling over with excitement. Even Spotty  the Turtle, who usually takes everything so calmly that some people  think him stupid, climbed up on the highest point of an old log where he  could see what was going on. Only Grandfather Frog, sitting on his big  green lily-pad and watching for foolish green flies for his breakfast,  appeared not to know that something unusual was going on. Really, he  was just as much excited as the rest, but because he is very old and  accounted very, very wise, it would not do for him to show it.    What was it all about? Why, all the Minks and the Coons and the Otters  and the Muskrats, who live and play around the Smiling Pool and the  Laughing Brook, were hunting for traps. Yes, Sir, they were hunting for  traps set by Farmer Brown's boy, just as Grandfather Frog had advised  them to.    Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter were hunting together. They were  swimming along close to shore just where the Laughing Brook leaves the  Smiling Pool, when Jerry wrinkled up his funny little nose and stopped  swimming. Sniff, sniff, sniff, went Jerry Muskrat. Then little cold  shivers ran down his backbone and way out to the tip of his tail.    \"What is it?\" asked Little Joe Otter.    \"It's the man-smell,\" whispered Jerry.    Just then Little Joe Otter gave a long sniff. \"My, I smell fish!\" he  cried, his eyes sparkling, and started in the direction from which the  smell came. He swam faster than Jerry, and in a minute he shouted in  delight.    \"Hi, Jerry! Some one's left a fish on the edge of the bank: What a  feast!\"    Jerry hurried as fast as he could swim, his eyes popping out with  fright, for the nearer he got, the stronger grew that dreadful  man-smell. \"Don't touch it,\" he panted. \"Don't touch it, Joe Otter!\"    Little Joe laughed. \"What's the matter, Jerry? 'Fraid I'll eat it all up  before you get here?\" he asked, as he reached out for the fish.    \"Stop!\" shrieked Jerry, and gave Little Joe a push, just as the latter  touched the fish.    Snap! A pair of wicked steel jaws flew together and caught Little Joe  Otter by a claw of one toe. If it hadn't been for Jerry's push, he would  have been caught by a foot.    \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" cried Little Joe Otter.    \"Next time I guess you'll remember what Grandfather Frog said about  watching out when you find things to eat where they never were before,\"  said Jerry, as he helped Little Joe pull himself free from the trap. But  he left the claw behind and had a dreadfully sore toe as a result.  Then they buried the trap deep down in the mud and started to look for  another.    All around the Smiling Pool and along the Laughing Brook their cousins  and uncles and aunts and friends were just as busy, and every once in a  while some one would have just as narrow an escape as Little Joe Otter.  And all the time up at the farmhouse Farmer Brown's boy was planning  what he would do with the skins of the little animals he was sure he  would catch in his traps.        CHAPTER VI: Farmer Brown's Boy Is Puzzled    Farmer Brown's boy was whistling merrily as he tramped down across the  Green Meadows. The Merry Little Breezes saw him coming, and they raced  over to the Smiling Pool to tell Billy Mink. Farmer Brown's boy was  coming to visit his traps. He was very sure that he would find Billy  Mink or Little Joe Otter, or Jerry Muskrat, or perhaps Bobby Coon.    Billy Mink was sitting on top of the Big Rock. He saw the Merry Little  Breezes racing across the Green Meadows, and behind them he saw Farmer  Brown's boy. Billy Mink dived head first into the Smiling Pool. Then  he swam over to Jerry Muskrat's house and warned Jerry. Together they  hunted up Little Joe Otter, and then the three little scamps in brown  hid in the bulrushes, where they could watch Farmer Brown's boy.    The first place Farmer Brown's boy visited was Jerry Muskrat's old log.  Very cautiously he peeped over the edge of the bank. The trap was gone!    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Farmer Brown's boy. He was very much excited, as he  caught hold of the end of the chain, which fastened it to the old log.  He was sure that at last he had caught Jerry Muskrat. When he pulled the  trap up, it was empty. Between the jaws were a few hairs and a little  bit of skin, which Jerry Muskrat had left there when he sprung the trap  with his tail.    Farmer Brown's boy was disappointed. \"Well, I'll get him to-morrow,  anyway,\" said he to himself. Then he went on to his next trap; it was  nowhere to be seen. When he pulled the chain he was so excited that he  trembled. The trap did not come up at once. He pulled and pulled, and  then suddenly up it came, all covered with mud. In it was one little  claw from Little Joe Otter. Very carefully Farmer Brown's boy set the  trap again. If he could have looked over in the bulrushes and have  seen Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat watching him and  tickling and laughing, he would not have been so sure that next time he  would catch Little Joe Otter.    All around the Smiling Pool and then up and down the Laughing Brook  Farmer Brown's boy tramped, and each trap he found sprung and buried in  the mud. He had stopped whistling by this time, and there was a puzzled  frown on his freckled face. What did it mean? Could some other boy have  found all his traps and played a trick by springing all of them? The  more he thought about it, the more puzzled he became. You see, he did  not know anything about the busy day the Minks and the Otters and the  Muskrats and the Coons had spent the day before.    Old Grandfather Frog, sitting on his big green lily-pad, smoothed down  his white and yellow waistcoat and winked up at jolly, round, red Mr.  Sun as Farmer Brown's boy tramped off across the Green Meadows.    \"Chugarum!\" said Grandfather Frog, as he snapped up a foolish green fly.  \"Much good it will do you to set those traps again!\"    Then Grandfather Frog called to Billy Mink and sent him to tell all the  other little people of the Smiling Pool and the Laughing Brook that they  must hurry and spring all the traps again as they had before.    This time it was easy, because they knew just where the traps were, so  all day long they dropped sticks and stones into the traps and once more  sprung them. Then they prepared for a grand feast of the good things to  eat which Farmer Brown's boy had left, scattered around the traps.        CHAPTER VII: Jerry Muskrat Makes A Discovery    The beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the  Smiling Pool, as it had to the Green Meadows and to the Green Forest.  Great-Grandfather Frog, who had slept the long winter away in his own  special bed way down in the mud, had waked up with an appetite so great  that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his  stomach. Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had  gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places  just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more  full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had  come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm  Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.    One sunny morning Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the middle of the  Smiling Pool, just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at  Little Joe Otter, who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water.  Suddenly Jerry's sharp eyes saw something that made him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5113"],[0,"The Confessions of a Beachcomber (#2)"],[1,"range. Four satellites stand in  attendance, enhancing charms superior to their own.    This island is our home. He who would see the most picturesque portions  of the whole of the 2000 miles of the east coast of Australia must pass  within a few yards of our domain.    In years gone by, Dunk Island, \"Coonanglebah\" of the blacks, had an evil  repute. Fertile and fruitful, set in the shining sea abounding with  dugong, turtle and all manner of fish; girt with rocks rough-cast with  oysters; teeming with bird life, and but little more than half an hour's  canoe trip from the mainland, the dusky denizens were fat, proud,  high-spirited, resentful and treacherous, far from friendly or polite to  strangers. One sea-captain was maimed for life in our quiet little bay  during a misunderstanding with a hasty black possessed of a new bright  tomahawk, a rare prize in those days. This was the most trivial of the  many incidents by which the natives expressed their character.  Inhospitable acts were common when the white folks first began to pay the  island visits, for they found the blacks hostile and daring. Why invoke  those long-silent spectres, white as well as black, when all active  boorishness is of the past? Civilisation has almost fulfilled its  inexorable law; but four out of a considerable population remain, and  they remember naught of the bad old times when the humanising processes,  or rather the results of them, began to be felt. They must have been a  fine race, fine for Australian aboriginals at least, judging by the stamp  of two of those who survive; and perhaps that is why they resented  interference, and consequently soon began to give way before the  irresistible pressure of the whites. Possibly, had they been more docile  and placid, the remnants would have been more numerous though less  flattering representatives of the race. You shall judge of the type by  what is related of some of the habits and customs of the semi-civilised  survivors.    Dunk Island is well within the tropical zone, its true bearings being 146  deg. 11 min. 20 sec. E. long., and 17 deg. 55 min. 25 sec. S. lat. It is  but 30 miles south of the port of Geraldton, the wettest place in  Australia, as well as the centre of the chief sugar-producing district of  the State of Queensland. There the rainfall averages about 140 inches per  annum. Geraldton has in its immediate background two of the highest  mountains in Australia (5,400 feet), and on these the monsoons buffet and  break their moisture-laden clouds, affording the district much  meteorological fame. Again, 20 miles to the south lies Hinchinbrook  Island, 28 miles long, 12 miles broad, and mountainous from end to end:  there also the rain-clouds revel. The long and picturesque channel which  divides Hinchinbrook from the mainland, and the complicated ranges of  mountains away to the west, participate in phenomenal rain.    Opposite Dunk Island the coastal range recedes and is of much lower  elevation, and to these facts perhaps is to be attributed our modified  rainfall compared with the plethora of the immediate North; but we get  our share, and when people deplore the droughts which devastate  Australia, let it be remembered that Australia is huge, and the most  rigorous of Australian droughts merely partial. This country has never  known drought. During the partial drought which ended with 1905, and  which occasioned great losses throughout the pastoral tracts of  Queensland, grass and herbage here were perennially green and  succulent--the creeks never ceased running.    Within the tropics heat is inevitable, but our island enjoys several  climatic advantages. The temperature is equable. Blow the wind  whithersoever it listeth, and it comes to us cooled by contact with the  sea. Here may we drink oft and deep at the never-failing font of pure,  soft, beneficent air. We have all the advantages which residence at the  happy mean from the Equator bestows, and few of the drawbacks. By its  fruits ye shall know the fertility of the soil.    Birds are numerous, from the \"scrub fowl\" which dwells in the dim jungle  and constructs of decaying leaves and wood and light loam the most  trustworthy of incubators, and wastes no valuable time in the  dead-and-alive duty of sitting, to the tiny sun-bird of yellow and  purple, which flits all day among scarlet hibiscus blooms, sips nectar  from the flame-tree, and rifles the dull red studs of the umbrella tree  of their sweetness.    The stalled ox is not here, nor the fatted calf, nor any of the mere  advantages of the table; but there is the varied harvest of the sea, and  all the freshness of an isle clean and green. The heat, the clatter, the  stuffy odours, the toilsomeness, the fatigue of town life are abandoned;  the careless quiet, the calm, the refreshment of the whole air, the tonic  of the wide sea are gained. From the moment the sun illumines our hills  and isles with glowing yellow until it drops in fiery splendour suddenly  out of sight leaving a band of gleaming red above the purple western  range, and a rippling red path across to Australia, the whole realm of  nature seems ours to command.    OFFICIAL LANDING    Dunk Island was not selected haphazard as an abiding place. By  camping-out expeditions and the cautious gleaning of facts from those who  had the repute of knowing the country, useful information had been  acquired unobtrusively. We were determined to have the best obtainable  isle. More than one locality was favourably considered ere good fortune  decided to send us hither to spy out the land. A camp-out on the shore of  then unnamed Brammo Bay--a holiday-making party--and the result of the  first day's exploration decided a revolutionary change in the lives of two  seriously-minded persons. A year after, a lease of the best portion of  the island having been obtained in the meanwhile, we came for good.    Wholly uninhabited, entirely free from traces of the mauling paws of  humanity, lovely in its mantle of varied foliage, what better sphere for  the exercise of benign autocracy could be desired? Here was virgin  country, 20 miles from the nearest port--sad and neglected Cardwell cut  off from the mainland by more than 2 miles of estranging ocean, and yet  lying in the track of small coastal steamers--here all our pet theories  might serenely develop.    But it was an inauspicious landing. With September begin the north-east  winds, and we had an average experience that afternoon. Was it not a  farce--a great deal more than a farce: a saucy, flippant imposition on the  tender mercies of Providence--for an individual who could not endure a few  hours of tossing on the bosom of the ocean without becoming deadly sick,  to imagine that he possessed the hardihood to establish a home even in  this lovely wilderness? We had tents and equipment and a boat of our own,  a workman to help us at the start, and two faithful black servants.    The year before, we had made the acquaintance of one of the few survivors  of the native population of the island--stalwart Tom. Although our project  and preparations had been kept fairly secret, he had overheard a casual  reference to them; had made a canoe, and paddling from island to island  with his gin, an infant and mother-in-law, had preceded our advent by a  week. His duties began with the discharging of the first boatload of  portable property. He comes and goes now after the lapse of years.    They spread out tents and rugs for the weak mortal who had greatly dared,  but who, thus early, was ready to faint from weariness and sickness. They  made comforting and soothing drinks, and spoke of cheery things in cheery  tones; but the sick man refused to be comforted. He wished himself back,  a participator in the conflicts of civilisation, and was fain to cover  his face--there was no wall to which to turn--and fancy that the most  dismal sound in the universe was the surly monotone the north-easter  harped on the beach. We reposed that night among the camp equipment, the  sick man caring for naught in his physical collapse and disconsolation.    But the first morning of the new life! A perfect combination of  invigorating elements. The cloudless sky, the clear air, the shining sea,  the green folded slopes of Tam o' Shanter Point opposite, the  cleanliness of the sand, the sweet odours from the eucalypts and the  dew-laden grass, the luminous purple of the islands to the south-east;  the range of mountains to the west and north-west, and our own fair  tract-awaiting and inviting, and all the mystery of petted illusions  about to be solved! Physic was never so eagerly swallowed nor wrought a  speedier or surer cure.    Feebleness and dismay vanished with the first plunge into the still  sleepy sea, and alertness and vigour returned, as the incense of the  first morning's sacrifice went straight as a column to the sky.    Over half a century before, Edmund B. Kennedy, the explorer, landed on  the opposite shore, on his ill-fated expedition up Cape York, to find the  country inland from Tam o' Shanter Point altogether different from any  previously-examined part of Australia. We gave no thought to the gallant  explorer, near as we were to the scenes of his desperate struggle in the  entanglements of the jungle.    The island was all before us, where to choose our place of rest, and the  bustle of the transport of goods and chattels to the site in the thick  forest invisible from the sea began at once. Before sunset, tents were  pitched among the trees, and a few yards of bush surrounding then  cleared, and we were at home.    Prior to departing from civilisation we had arranged for the construction  of a hut of cedar, so contrived with nicely adjusting parts and bolts,  and all its members numbered, that a mere amateur could put it together.  If at the end of six months' trial the life was found to be unendurable,  or serious objection not dreamt of in our salad philosophy "]]]
