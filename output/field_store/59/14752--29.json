Skidded, I suppose.\"    \"Come on, girls,\" said Anne. \"There is no use in staying here any  longer. We've had excitement enough for one day.\"    \"I should say so,\" shuddered Jessica. \"I hope that woman doesn't die. We  must go to the hospital to-morrow and inquire for her.\"    \"Of course,\" responded Anne. \"What a sweet face she had, and her eyes  were such a beautiful brown, but they haunted me. There is something so  familiar about them.\"    \"Why, that's just what I thought, too!\" cried Grace. \"Who is it she  resembles?\"    \"Give it up,\" said Nora. \"Although I noticed it, too.\"    Jessica alone made no remark. Her face wore a puzzled frown, as though  she were searching her memory for something.    \"Oh, well, what's the use of worrying over a resemblance,\" said Nora. \"I  wonder what days visitors are allowed at the hospital.\"    \"By the way, Jessica,\" said Anne, \"where is Mabel! She usually waits for  you.\"    \"Mabel is--\" began Jessica. Then she stopped, her eyes filling with  wonder, almost alarm. \"Girls,\" she cried, her voice rising to an excited  scream. \"I know who that woman resembles! She looks like Mabel Allison.\"          CHAPTER II    WHAT THE DAY BROUGHT FORTH      For a second the three girls fairly gasped at Jessica's discovery. Grace  was the first to speak.    \"You have hit the nail on the head, Jessica. That's why her face seemed  so familiar. The resemblance is striking.\"    The four girls glanced from one to another, the same thought in mind.  Perhaps the mystery of Mabel Allison's parentage was to be solved at  last.    Those who have read \"Grace Harlowe's Junior Year at High  School\" will recall how the Phi Sigma Tau became interested in  Mabel Allison, a young girl taken from an orphanage by Miss Brant, a  woman devoid of either gentleness or sympathy, who treated her young  charge with great cruelty.    It will be remembered that through the efforts of Grace and Jessica,  aided by Jessica's father, Miss Brant was forced to give Mabel up, and  she became a member of the Bright household, and the especial protegee  of the Phi Sigma Tau.    Grace and her friends had always believed Mabel to be a child of good  family. She had been picked up in the streets of New York when a baby,  and taken to the police station, where she had been held for some time,  but on remaining unclaimed, had been sent to an orphanage outside New  York City, where she had spent her life until she had been brought to  Oakdale by Miss Brant.    Although Mabel had been in the Bright household but a few months,  Jessica, who was motherless, had become deeply attached to her, while  Jessica's father was equally fond of the young girl.    She had spent her vacation with the Phi Sigma Tau, who were the guests  of Judge Putnam, a prominent Oakdale citizen, and his sister at their  camp in the Adirondacks. The judge had conceived a great affection for  her, and on hearing her story had offered to adopt her.    This proved a cross to Jessica, who was torn between her desire to keep  Mabel with her, and the feeling that the opportunity was too great for  Mabel to refuse. Mabel had left the decision to Jessica, and the judge  was still awaiting his answer.    \"I might have known something would happen to take her away,\" almost  wailed Jessica. \"First, the judge, and now--\"    \"Don't be a goose, Jessica,\" said Nora stoutly, \"and don't jump at the  conclusion that this strange woman is a relative of Mabel's. There are  lots of chance resemblances.\"    \"Of course there are,\" consoled Grace. \"When we go to the hospital  to-morrow we'll find no doubt that our stranger is named 'Smith' or  'Brown' or anything except 'Allison.'\"    \"Don't worry, dear,\" said Anne, slipping her hand into Jessica's. \"No  one will take your one chicken from you.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" responded Jessica gloomily. \"I feel in my  bones that something terrible is going to happen. I suppose you girls  think me foolish about Mabel, but I've no mother or sister, and you know  yourselves what a dear Mabel is.\"    \"Forget it,\" advised Nora wisely. \"We've had enough to harrow our young  feelings to-day. Let's go and drown our sorrows in sundaes. I'll treat  until my money gives out, and then the rest of you can take up the good  work.\"    \"Who will go to the hospital with me to-morrow!\" asked Grace when they  were seated around a table at Stillman's.    \"Let me see. To-morrow is Sunday,\" said Jessica. \"I'm afraid I can't go.  Papa is going to take Mabel and me for a drive.\"    \"I'll go with, you,\" volunteered Nora.    \"And I,\" said Anne.    \"Good girls,\" commended Grace. \"Meet me here at three o'clock. I am  fairly sure that visitors are allowed on Sunday, but if I am mistaken we  can at least go to the office and inquire for our stranger.\"    The three girls met in front of Stillman's at exactly three o'clock the  following afternoon, and set out for the hospital.    \"Visitors are allowed on Sunday from three until five,\" remarked Grace  as they strolled down Main Street. \"I telephoned last night to the  hospital. Our stranger is not seriously hurt. She is badly shaken up,  and awfully nervous. If she feels more calm to-day we may be allowed to  see her.\"    \"What is her name?\" asked Anne.    Grace looked blank, then exclaimed: \"Why, girls, how stupid of me! I  forgot to ask. I was so interested in hearing about her condition that I  never thought of that.\"    \"Well, our curiosity will soon be satisfied in that respect,\" said Nora,  \"for here we are at the hospital.\"    \"We should like to see the woman who was thrown from the automobile  yesterday afternoon,\" said Grace to the matron. \"Is she able to receive  visitors?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" replied the matron. \"She is sitting in a wheeled chair on the  second-story veranda. Miss Elton,\" she called to a nurse who had just  entered, \"take these young women up to the veranda, they wish to see the  patient who has 47.\"    \"What is her--\" began Grace. But at that moment a nurse hurried in with  a communication for the matron. Grace waited a moment, bent on repeating  her question, but the nurse said rather impatiently, \"This way, please,\"  and the opportunity was lost.    The three girls began to feel a trifle diffident as they approached the  stranger who was seated in a wheeled chair in a corner of the veranda.    \"Visitors to see you, madam,\" said the nurse curtly, halting before the  patient. \"Be careful not to over-exert yourself,\" and was gone.    The woman in the chair turned quickly at the nurse's words, her eyes  resting upon the three girls.    Grace felt a queer little shiver creep up and down her spine. The  resemblance between the stranger and Mabel Allison was even more  remarkable to-day.    \"How do you do, my dears,\" said the woman with a sweet smile, extending  her hand in turn to the three girls. \"Under the circumstances I am sure  you will pardon me for not rising.\"    Her voice was clear and well modulated.    \"Please don't think of it,\" cried Grace. \"We saw the accident yesterday.  We were afraid you were seriously injured, and we couldn't resist coming  to see you. I am Grace Harlowe, and these are my friends Nora O'Malley  and Anne Pierson.\"    \"I am very pleased to know you,\" responded the stranger. \"It is so sweet  to know that you thought of me.\"    \"Miss Harlowe was the first to reach you, after your accident,\" said  Anne, knowing that Grace herself would avoid mentioning it. \"She held  your head in her lap until the doctor came.\"    \"Then I am deeply indebted to you,\" returned the patient, again taking  Grace's hand in hers, \"and I hope to know you better. I dearly love  young girls.\"    She motioned them to a broad settee near her chair.    \"There!\" she exclaimed. \"Now I can look at all of you at the same time.  I am far more able to appreciate you to-day than I was at this time  yesterday. It was all so dreadful,\" she shuddered slightly, then  continued.    \"I have never before been in an accident. I had been spending a week  with some friends of mine who have a place a few miles from here called  'Hawk's Nest.' Perhaps you know of it?\"    The three girls exchanged glances. \"Hawk's Nest\" was one of the finest  estates in that part of the state, and the Gibsons who owned it had  unlimited wealth.    \"I was summoned to New York on business and had barely time to make my  train. Mrs. Gibson's chauffeur had been running the car at a high rate  of speed, and just as we reached the little incline above the station,  the machine skidded, and we crashed into that tree. I felt a frightful  jar that seemed to loosen every bone in my body, and remembered nothing  further until I came back to earth again, here in the hospital.\"    \"You opened your eyes, once, before the ambulance came,\" said Grace.    \"Did I!\" smiled the stranger. \"I do not remember it. But, really, I am  very rude! I have not told you my name.\"    \"It's coming,\" thought Grace, unconsciously bracing herself. Nora and  Anne had also straightened up, their eyes fastened on the speaker.    \"My name is Allison,\" said the woman, wholly unaware of the bombshell  she had exploded. \"I am a widow and quite alone "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#2)"],[1,"the neck I want      To take the nodder,      And choke the life      From the hateful twitcher.

Though I love the beasts      All better than thee--      Tree and bird      And the fish in the brook,      One and all      They are dearer than thou--  How is it I always return?

SIEGFRIED    Well, Mime, being so clever,  This one thing more also tell me:            [_Simply._        The birds sang together      So gaily in spring,    [Illustration: \"And there I learned                  What love was like\"                             See p. 11]            [_Tenderly._    The one alluring the other;      And thou didst say,      When I asked thee why,  That they were wives with their husbands.        They chattered so sweetly,      Were never apart;      They builded a nest      In which they might brood;      The fluttering young ones      Came flying out,  And both took care of the young.      The roes in the woods, too,      Rested in pairs,  The wild wolves even, and foxes.      Food was found them and brought      By the father,  The mother suckled the young ones.      And there I learned      What love was like;      A whelp from its mother      I never took.      But where hast thou, Mime,      A wife dear and loving,  That I may call her mother?

I came to the limpid brook,      And the beasts and the trees      I saw reflected;      Sun and clouds too,      Just as they are,  Were mirrored quite plain in the stream.      I also could spy      This face of mine,      And quite unlike thine      Seemed it to me;      As little alike      As a fish to a toad:  And when had fish toad for its father?
