Even in Japan alone  it has differentiated itself into thirteen main sects and forty-four  sub-sects[FN#6] and is still in full vigour, though in other  countries it has already passed its prime.  Thus Japan seems to be  the best representative of the Buddhist countries where the majority  of people abides by the guiding principle of the Northern School.  To  study her religion, therefore, is to penetrate into Mahayanism, which  still lies an unexplored land for the Western minds.  And to  investigate her faith is not to dig out the remains of Buddhist faith  that existed twenty centuries ago, but to touch the heart and soul of  Mahayanism that enlivens its devotees at the present moment.      [FN#5]  Hinayanism is, generally speaking, inclined to be  pessimistic, but Mahayanism in the main holds the optimistic view of  life.  Nihilism is advocated in some Mahayana sutras, but others set  forth idealism or realism.    [FN#6]  (1) The Ten Dai Sect, including three sub-sects; (2) The Shin  Gon Sect, including eleven sub-sects; (3) The Ritsu Sect; (4) The Rin  Zai Sect, including fourteen sub-sects; (5) The So To Sect; (6) The O  Baku Sect; (7) The Jo Do Sect, including two sub-sects; (8) The Shin  Sect, including ten sub-sects; (9) The Nichi Ren Sect, including nine  sub-sects; (10) The Yu Zu Nen Butsu Sect; (11) The Hosso Sect; (12)  The Ke Gon Sect; (13) The Ji Sect.  Out of these thirteen Buddhist  sects, Rin Zai, So To, and O Baku belong to Zen.  For further  information, see 'A Short History of the Twelve Japanese Buddhist  Sects,' by Dr. B. Nanjo.      The object of this little book is to show how the Mahayanistic view  of life and of the world differs markedly from that of Hinayanism,  which is generally taken as Buddhism by occidentals, to explain how  the religion of Buddha has adapted itself to its environment in the  Far East, and also to throw light on the existing state of the  spiritual life of modern Japan.    For this purpose we have singled out of thirteen Japanese sects the  Zen Sect, [FN#7] not only because of the great influence it has  exercised on the nation, but because of the unique position it holds  among the established religious systems of the world.  In the first  place, it is as old as Buddhism itself, or even older, for its mode  of practising Meditation has been handed down without much alteration  from pre-Buddhistic recluses of India; and it may, on that account,  provide the student of comparative religion with an interesting  subject for his research.      [FN#7]  The word Zen is the Sinico-Japanese abbreviation of the  Sanskrit Dhyana, or Meditation.  It implies the whole body of  teachings and discipline peculiar to a Buddhist sect now popularly  known as the Zen Sect.      In the second place, in spite of its historical antiquity, ideas  entertained by its advocates are so new that they are in harmony with  those of the New Buddhists;[FN#8] accordingly the statement of these  ideas may serve as an explanation of the present movement conducted  by young and able reformers of Japanese Buddhism.      [FN#8]  There exists a society formed by men who have broken with the  old creeds of Buddhism, and who call themselves the New Buddhists.  It has for its organ 'The New Buddhism,' and is one of the  influential religious societies in Japan.  We mean by the New  Buddhists, however, numerous educated young men who still adhere to  Buddhist sects, and are carrying out a reformation.      Thirdly, Buddhist denominations, like non-Buddhist religions, lay  stress on scriptural authority; but Zen denounces it on the ground  that words or characters can never adequately express religious  truth, which can only be realized by mind; consequently it claims  that the religious truth attained by Shakya Muni in his Enlightenment  has been handed down neither by word of mouth nor by the letters of  scriptures, but from teacher's mind to disciple's through the line of  transmission until the present day.  It is an isolated instance in  the whole history of the world's religions that holy scriptures are  declared to be 'no more than waste[FN#9] paper by religionists, as  done by Zen masters.      [FN#9]  Lin Tsi Luh (Rin-zai-roku).      Fourthly, Buddhist as well as non-Buddhist religions regard, without  exception, their founders as superhuman beings, but the practisers of  Zen hold the Buddha as their predecessor, whose spiritual level they  confidently aim to attain.  Furthermore, they liken one who remains  in the exalted position of Buddhaship to a man bound by a gold chain,  and pity his state of bondage.  Some of them went even so far as to  declare Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to be their servants and  slaves.[FN#10]  Such an attitude of religionists can hardly be found  in any other religion.      [FN#10]  \"Shakya and Maitreya,\" says Go So, \"are servants to the  other person.  Who is that other person?\" (Zen-rin-rui-ju, Vol. i.,  p. 28).      Fifthly, although non-Buddhist people are used to call Buddhism  idolatry, yet Zen can never be called so in the accepted sense of the  term, because it, having a grand conception of Deity, is far from  being a form of idol-worship; nay, it sometimes even took an  iconoclastic attitude as is exemplified by Tan Hia, [FN#11] who  warmed himself on a cold morning by making a fire of wooden statues.  Therefore our exposition on this point will show the real state of  existing Buddhism, and serve to remove religious prejudices  entertained against it.      [FN#11]  A Chinese Zen teacher, well known for his peculiarities, who  died in A.D. 824.  For the details of this anecdote, see  Zen-rin-rui-ju, Vol. i., P. 39.      Sixthly, there is another characteristic of Zen, which cannot be  found in any other religion-that is to say, its peculiar mode of  expressing profound religious insight by such actions as the lifting  up of a hair-brush, or by the tapping of the chair with a staff, or  by a loud outcry, and so forth.  This will give the student of  religion a striking illustration of differentiated forms of religion  in its scale of evolution.    Besides these characteristics, Zen is noted for its physical and  mental training.  That the daily practice of Zazen[FN#12] and the  breathing exercise remarkably improves one's physical condition is an  established fact.  And history proves that most Zen masters enjoyed a  long life in spite of their extremely simple mode of living.  Its  mental discipline, however, is by far more fruitful, and keeps one's  mind in equipoise, making one neither passionate nor dispassionate,  neither sentimental nor unintelligent, neither nervous nor senseless.   It is well known as a cure to all sorts of mental disease,  occasioned by nervous disturbance, as a nourishment to the fatigued  brain, and also as a stimulus to torpor and sloth.  It is  self-control, as it is the subduing of such pernicious passions as  anger, jealousy, hatred, and the like, and the awakening of noble  emotions such as sympathy, mercy, generosity, and what not.  It is a  mode of Enlightenment, as it is the dispelling of illusion and of  doubt, and at the same time it is the overcoming of egoism, the  destroying of mean desires, the uplifting of the moral ideal, and the  disclosing of inborn wisdom.      [FN#12]  The sitting-in-meditation, for the full explanation of which  see Chapter VIII.      The historical importance of Zen can hardly be exaggerated.  After  its introduction into China in the sixth century, A.D., it grew  ascendant through the Sui (598-617) and the Tang dynasty (618-906),  and enjoyed greater popularity than any other sect of Buddhism during  the whole period of the Sung (976-1126) and the Southern Sung dynasty  (1127-1367).  In these times its commanding influence became so  irresistible that Confucianism, assimilating the Buddhist teachings,  especially those of Zen, into itself and changing its entire aspect,  brought forth the so-called Speculative philosophy.[FN#13]  And in  the Ming dynasty (1368-1659) the principal doctrines of Zen were  adopted by a celebrated Confucian scholar, Wang Yang Ming,[FN#14] who  thereby founded a school, through which Zen exercised profound  influence on Chinese and Japanese men of letters, statesmen, and  soldiers.    As regards Japan, it was first introduced into the island as the  faith first for the Samurai or the military class, and moulded the  characters of many distinguished soldiers whose lives adorn the pages  of her history.  Afterwards it gradually found its way to palaces as  well as to cottages through literature and art, and at last permeated  through every fibre of the national life.  It is Zen that modern  Japan, especially after the Russo-Japanese War, has acknowledged as  an ideal doctrine for her rising generation.      [FN#13]  See 'A History of Chinese Philosophy,' by Ryukichi Endo, and  A History of Chinese Philosophy,' by Giichi Nakauchi.    [FN#14]  For the life of this distinguished scholar and soldier  (1472-1529), see 'A Detailed Life of O Yo MeiÂ’ by Takejiro Takase, and  also 'O-yo-mei-shutsu-shin-sei-ran-roku.'            CHAPTER I        HISTORY OF ZEN IN CHINA      1. Origin of Zen in India.    To-day Zen as a living faith can be found in its pure form only among  the Japanese Buddhists.  You cannot find it in the so-called Gospel  of Buddha anymore than you can find Unitarianism in the Pentateuch,  nor can you find it in China and India any more than you can find  life in fossils of bygone ages.  It is beyond all doubt that it can  be traced back to Shakya Muni himself, nay, even to pre-Buddhistic  times, because Brahmanic teachers practised Dhyana, or  Meditation,[FN#15] from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#2)"],[1,", and--and you are certainly rather odd in  appearance.\"    Again the silvery laughter rang through the glade.    \"Uninvited!\" echoed the creature, clapping her hands together  delightedly; \"uninvited to my own forest home!  Why, my dear girls, you  are the uninvited ones--indeed you are--to thus come romping into our  fairy bower.\"    The children did not open their eyes any wider on hearing this speech,  for they could not; but their faces expressed their amazement fully,  while Helda gasped the words:    \"A fairy bower!  We are in a fairy bower!\"    \"Most certainly,\" was the reply.  \"And as for being odd in appearance,  let me ask how you could reasonably expect a fairy to appear as mortal  maidens do?\"    \"A fairy!\" exclaimed Seseley.  \"Are you, then, a real fairy?\"    \"I regret to say I am,\" returned the other, more soberly, as she patted  a moss-bank with a silver-tipped wand.    Then for a moment there was silence, while the three girls sat very  still and stared at their immortal companion with evident curiosity.  Finally Seseley asked:    \"Why do you regret being a fairy?  I have always thought them the  happiest creatures in the world.\"    \"Perhaps we ought to be happy,\" answered the fairy, gravely, \"for we  have wonderful powers and do much to assist you helpless mortals.  And  I suppose some of us really are happy.  But, for my part, I am so  utterly tired of a fairy life that I would do anything to change it.\"    \"That is strange,\" declared Berna.  \"You seem very young to be already  discontented with your lot.\"    Now at this the fairy burst into laughter again, and presently asked:    \"How old do you think me?\"    \"About our own age,\" said Berna, after a glance at her and a moment's  reflection.    \"Nonsense!\" retorted the fairy, sharply.  \"These trees are hundreds of  years old, yet I remember when they were mere twigs.  And I remember  when mortals first came to live upon this island, yes--and when this  island was first created and rose from the sea after a great  earthquake.  I remember for many, many centuries, my dears.  I have  grown tired of remembering--and of being a fairy continually, without  any change to brighten my life.\"    \"To be sure!\" said Seseley, with sympathy.  \"I never thought of fairy  life in that way before.  It must get to be quite tiresome.\"    \"And think of the centuries I must yet live!\" exclaimed the fairy in a  dismal voice.  \"Isn't it an awful thing to look forward to?\"    \"It is, indeed,\" agreed Seseley.    \"I'd be glad to exchange lives with you,\" said Helda, looking at the  fairy with intense admiration.    \"But you can't do that,\" answered the little creature quickly.  \"Mortals can't become fairies, you know--although I believe there was  once a mortal who was made immortal.\"    \"But fairies can become anything they desire!\" cried Berna.    \"Oh, no, they can't.  You are mistaken if you believe that,\" was the  reply.  \"I could change YOU into a fly, or a crocodile, or a bobolink,  if I wanted to; but fairies can't change themselves into anything else.\"    \"How strange!\" murmured Seseley, much impressed.    \"But YOU can,\" cried the fairy, jumping up and coming toward them.  \"You are mortals, and, by the laws that govern us, a mortal can change  a fairy into anything she pleases.\"    \"Oh!\" said Seseley, filled with amazement at the idea.    The fairy fell on her knees before the baron's daughter.  \"Please--please, dear Seseley,\" she pleaded, \"change me into a mortal!\"        4.  Prince Marvel    It is easy to imagine the astonishment of the three girls at hearing  this strange request.  They gazed in a bewildered fashion upon the  kneeling fairy, and were at first unable to answer one word.  Then  Seseley said--sadly, for she grieved to disappoint the pretty creature:    \"We are but mortal children, and have no powers of enchantment at all.\"    \"Ah, that is true, so far as concerns yourselves,\" replied the fairy,  eagerly; \"yet mortals may easily transform fairies into anything they  wish.\"    \"If that is so, why have we never heard of this power before?\" asked  Seseley.    \"Because fairies, as a rule, are content with their lot, and do not  wish to appear in any form but their own.  And, knowing that evil or  mischievous mortals can transform them at will, the fairies take great  care to remain invisible, so they can not be interfered with.  Have you  ever,\" she asked, suddenly, \"seen a fairy before?\"    \"Never,\" replied Seseley.    \"Nor would you have seen me to-day, had I not known you were kind and  pure-hearted, or had I not resolved to ask you to exercise your powers  upon me.\"    \"I must say,\" remarked Helda, boldly, \"that you are foolish to wish to  become anything different from what you are.\"    \"For you are very beautiful NOW,\" added Berna, admiringly.    \"Beautiful!\" retorted the fairy, with a little frown; \"what does beauty  amount to, if one is to remain invisible?\"    \"Not much, that is true,\" agreed Berna, smoothing her own dark locks.    \"And as for being foolish,\" continued the fairy, \"I ought to be allowed  to act foolishly if I want to.  For centuries past I have not had a  chance to do a single foolish thing.\"    \"Poor dear!\" said Helda, softly.    Seseley had listened silently to this conversation.  Now she inquired:    \"What do you wish to become?\"    \"A mortal!\" answered the fairy, promptly.    \"A girl, like ourselves?\" questioned the baron's daughter.    \"Perhaps,\" said the fairy, as if undecided.    \"Then you would be likely to endure many privations,\" said Seseley,  gently.  \"For you would have neither father nor mother to befriend you,  nor any house to live in.\"    \"And if you hired your services to some baron, you would be obliged to  wash dishes all day, or mend clothing, or herd cattle,\" said Berna.    \"But I should travel all over the island,\" said the fairy, brightly,  \"and that is what I long to do.  I do not care to work.\"    \"I fear a girl would not be allowed to travel alone,\" Seseley remarked,  after some further thought.  \"At least,\" she added, \"I have never heard  of such a thing.\"    \"No,\" said the fairy, rather bitterly, \"your men are the ones that roam  abroad and have adventures of all kinds.  Your women are poor, weak  creatures, I remember.\"    There was no denying this, so the three girls sat silent until Seseley  asked:    \"Why do you wish to become a mortal?\"    \"To gain exciting experiences,\" answered the fairy.  \"I'm tired of  being a humdrum fairy year in and year out.  Of course, I do not wish  to become a mortal for all time, for that would get monotonous, too;  but to live a short while as the earth people do would amuse me very  much.\"    \"If you want variety, you should become a boy,\" said Helda, with a  laugh, \"The life of a boy is one round of excitement.\"    \"Then make me a boy!\" exclaimed the fairy eagerly.    \"A boy!\" they all cried in consternation.  And Seseley added:    \"Why--you're a GIRL fairy, aren't you?\"    \"Well--yes; I suppose I am,\" answered the beautiful creature, smiling;  \"but as you are going to change me anyway, I may as well become a boy  as a girl.\"    \"Better!\" declared Helda, clapping her hands; \"for then you can do as  you please.\"    \"But would it be right?\" asked Seseley, with hesitation.    \"Why not?\" retorted the fairy.  \"I can see nothing wrong in being a  boy.  Make me a tall, slender youth, with waving brown hair and dark  eyes.  Then I shall be as unlike my own self as possible, and the  adventure will be all the more interesting.  Yes; I like the idea of  being a boy very much indeed.\"    \"But I don't know how to transform you; some one will have to show me  the way to do it,\" protested Seseley, who was getting worried over the  task set her.    \"Oh, that will be easy enough,\" returned the little immortal.  \"Have  you a wand?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then I'll loan you mine, for I shall not need it.  And you must wave  it over my head three times and say: 'By my mortal powers I transform  you into a boy for the space of one year'.\"    \"One year!  Isn't that too long?\"    \"It's a very short time to one who has lived thousands of years as a  fairy.\"    \"That is true,\" answered the baron's daughter.    \"Now, I'll begin by doing a little transforming myself,\" said the  fairy, getting upon her feet again, \"and you can watch and see how I do  it.\"  She brushed a bit of moss from her gauzy skirts and continued:  \"If I'm to become a boy I shall need a horse, you know.  A handsome,  prancing steed, very fleet of foot.\"    A moment she stood motionless, as if listening.  Then she uttered a low  but shrill whistle.    The three girls, filled with eager interest, watched her intently.    Presently a trampling of footsteps was heard through the brushwood, and  a beautiful deer burst from the forest and fearlessly ran to the fairy.  Without hesitation she waved her wand above the deer's head and  exclaimed:    \"By all my fairy powers I command you to become a war-horse for the  period of one year.\"    Instantly the deer disappeared, and in its place was a handsome  charger, milk-white in color, with flowing mane and tail.  Upon its  back was a saddle sparkling with brilliant gems sewn upon fine dressed  leather.    The girls uttered cries of astonishment and delight, and the fairy said:    \"You see, these transformations are not at all difficult.  I must now  have a sword.\"    She plucked a twig from a near-by tree and cast it upon the ground at  her feet.  Again she waved her wand--and the twig turned to a gleaming  sword, richly engraved, that seemed to the silent watchers to tremble  slightly in its sheath, as if its heart of steel throbbed with hopes of  battles to come.    \"And now I must have shield and armor,\" said the fairy, gaily.  \"This  will make a shield,\"--and she stripped a sheet of loose bark from a  tree-trunk,--\"but for armor I must have something better.  Will you  give me your cloak?\"    This appeal was made to Seseley, and the baron's daughter drew her  white velvet cloak"]]]
