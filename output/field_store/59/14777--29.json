But Giotto did  something else besides watching his sheep. Indeed, he sometimes forgot  all about them, and many a search he had to gather them all together  again. For there was one thing he loved doing better than all beside,  and that was to try to draw pictures of all the things he saw around  him.    It was no easy matter for the little shepherd lad. He had no pencils or  paper, and he had never, perhaps, seen a picture in all his life. But  all this mattered little to him. Out there, under the blue sky, his  eyes made pictures for him out of the fleecy white clouds as they  slowly changed from one form to another. He learned to know exactly the  shape of every flower and how it grew; he noticed how the olive-trees  laid their silver leaves against the blue background of the sky that  peeped in between, and how his sheep looked as they stooped to eat, or  lay down in the shadow of a rock.    Nothing escaped his keen, watchful eyes, and then with eager hands he  would sharpen a piece of stone, choose out the smoothest rock, and try  to draw on its flat surface all those wonderful shapes which had filled  his eyes with their beauty. Olive-trees, flowers, birds and beasts were  there, but especially his sheep, for they were his friends and  companions who were always near him, and he could draw them in a  different way each time they moved.    Now it fell out that one day a great master painter from Florence came  riding through the valley and over the hills where Giotto was feeding  his sheep. The name of the great master was Cimabue, and he was the  most wonderful artist in the world, so men said. He had painted a  picture which had made all Florence rejoice. The Florentines had never  seen anything like it before, and yet it was but a strange-looking  portrait of the Madonna and Child, scarcely like a real woman or a real  baby at all. Still, it seemed to them a perfect wonder, and Cimabue was  honoured as one of the city's greatest men.    The road was lonely as it wound along. There was nothing to be seen but  waves of grey hills on every side, so the stranger rode on, scarcely  lifting his eyes as he went. Then suddenly he came upon a flock of  sheep nibbling the scanty sunburnt grass, and a little brown-faced  shepherd-boy gave him a cheerful 'Good-day, master.'    There was something so bright and merry in the boy's smile that the  great man stopped and began to talk to him. Then his eye fell upon the  smooth flat rock over which the boy had been bending, and he started  with surprise.    'Who did that?' he asked quickly, and he pointed to the outline of a  sheep scratched upon the stone.    'It is the picture of one of my sheep there,' answered the boy, hanging  his head with a shame-faced look. 'I drew it with this,' and he held  out towards the stranger the sharp stone he had been using.    'Who taught you to do this?' asked the master as he looked more  carefully at the lines drawn on the rock.    The boy opened his eyes wide with astonishment 'Nobody taught me,  master,' he said. 'I only try to draw the things that my eyes see.'    'How would you like to come with me to Florence and learn to be a  painter?' asked Cimabue, for he saw that the boy had a wonderful power  in his little rough hands.    Giotto's cheeks flushed, and his eyes shone with joy.    'Indeed, master, I would come most willingly,' he cried, 'if only my  father will allow it.'    So back they went together to the village, but not before Giotto had  carefully put his sheep into the fold, for he was never one to leave  his work half done.    Bondone was amazed to see his boy in company with such a grand  stranger, but he was still more surprised when he heard of the  stranger's offer. It seemed a golden chance, and he gladly gave his  consent.    Why, of course, the boy should go to Florence if the gracious master  would take him and teach him to become a painter. The home would be  lonely without the boy who was so full of fun and as bright as a  sunbeam. But such chances were not to be met with every day, and he was  more than willing to let him go.    So the master set out, and the boy Giotto went with him to Florence to  begin his training.    The studio where Cimabue worked was not at all like those artists'  rooms which we now call studios. It was much more like a workshop, and  the boys who went there to learn how to draw and paint were taught  first how to grind and prepare the colours and then to mix them. They  were not allowed to touch a brush or pencil for a long time, but only  to watch their master at work, and learn all that they could from what  they saw him do.    So there the boy Giotto worked and watched, but when his turn came to  use the brush, to the amazement of all, his pictures were quite unlike  anything which had ever been painted before in the workshop. Instead of  copying the stiff, unreal figures, he drew real people, real animals,  and all the things which he had learned to know so well on the grey  hillside, when he watched his father's sheep. Other artists had painted  the Madonna and Infant Christ, but Giotto painted a mother and a baby.    And before long this worked such a wonderful change that it seemed  indeed as if the art of making pictures had been born again. To us his  work still looks stiff and strange, but in it was the beginning of all  the beautiful pictures that belong to us now.    Giotto did not only paint pictures, he worked in marble as well.  To-day, if you walk through Florence, the City of Flowers, you will  still see its fairest flower of all, the tall white campanile or  bell-tower, 'Giotto's tower' as it is called. There it stands in all  its grace and loveliness like a tall white lily against the blue sky,  pointing ever upward, in the grand old faith of the shepherd-boy. Day  after day it calls to prayer and to good works, as it has done all  these hundreds of years since Giotto designed and helped to build it.    Some people call his pictures stiff and ugly, for not every one has  wise eyes to see their beauty, but the loveliness of this tower can  easily be seen by all. 'There the white doves circle round and round,  and rest in the sheltering niches of the delicately carved arches;  there at the call of its bell the black-robed Brothers of Pity hurry  past to their works of mercy. There too the little children play, and  sometimes stop to stare at the marble pictures, set in the first story  of the tower, low enough to be seen from the street. Their special  favourite is perhaps the picture of the shepherd sitting under his  tent, with the sheep in front, and with the funniest little dog keeping  watch at the side.    Giotto always had a great love for animals, and whenever it was  possible he would squeeze one into a corner of his pictures. He was  sixty years old when he designed this wonderful tower and cut some of  the marble pictures with his own hand, but you can see that the memory  of those old days when he ran barefoot about the hills and tended his  sheep was with him still. Just such another little puppy must have  often played with him in those long-ago days before he became a great  painter and was still only a merry, brown-faced boy, making pictures  with a sharp stone upon the smooth rocks.    Up and down the narrow streets of Florence now, the great painter would  walk and watch the faces of the people as they passed. And his eyes  would still make pictures of them and their busy life, just as they  used to do with the olive-trees, the sheep, and the clouds.    In those days nobody cared to have pictures in their houses, and only  the walls of the churches were painted. So the pictures, or frescoes,  as they were called, were of course all about sacred subjects, either  stories out of the Bible or of the lives of the saints. And as there  were few books, and the poor people did not know how to read, these  frescoed walls were the only story-books they had.    What a joy those pictures of Giotto's must have been, then, to those  poor folk! They looked at the little Baby Jesus sitting on His mother's  knee, wrapped in swaddling bands, just like one of their own little  ones, and it made Him seem a very real baby. The wise men who talked  together and pointed to the shining star overhead looked just like any  of the great nobles of Florence. And there at the back were the two  horses looking on with wise interested eyes, just as any of their own  horses might have done.    It seemed to make the story of Christmas a thing which had really  happened, instead of a far-away tale which had little meaning for them.  Heaven and the Madonna were not so far off after all. And it comforted  them to think that the Madonna had been a real woman like themselves,  and that the Jesu Bambino would stoop to bless them still, just as He  leaned forward to bless the wise men in the picture.    How real too would seem the old story of the meeting of Anna and  Joachim at the Golden Gate, when they could gaze upon the two homely  figures under the narrow gateway. No visionary saints these, but just a  simple husband and wife, meeting each other with joy after a sad  separation, and yet with the touch of heavenly meaning shown by the  angel who hovers above and places a hand upon each head.    It was not only in Florence that Giotto did his work. His fame spread  far and wide, and he went from town to town eagerly welcomed by all. We  can trace his footsteps as he went, by those wonderful old pictures  which he spread with loving care over the bare walls of the churches,  lifting, as it were, the curtain that hides Heaven from our view and  bringing some of its joys to earth.    Then, at Assisi, he covered the walls and ceiling of the church with  the wonderful frescoes of the life of St. Francis; and the little round  commonplace Arena Chapel of Padua is made exquisite inside by his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5304"],[0,"My Robin (#2)"],[1," He was standing in the grass and when I turned my eyes  upon him I only just saved myself from starting--which would have meant  disaster. I saw upon his breast the first dawning of a flush of  color--more tawny than actual red at that stage--but it hinted at  revelations.    \"Further subterfuge is useless,\" I said to him. \"You are betrayed. You  are a robin.\"    And he did not attempt to deny it either then or at any future time. In  less than two weeks he revealed a tight, glossy little bright red satin  waistcoat and with it a certain youthful maturity such as one beholds in  the wearer of a first dress suit. His movements were more brisk and  certain. He began to make little flights and little sounds though for  some time he made no attempt to sing. Instead of appearing suddenly in  the grass at my feet, a heavenly little rush of wings would bring  him to a bough over my head or a twig quite near me where he would  tilt daintily, taking his silent but quite responsive part in the  conversations which always took place between us. It was I who  talked--telling him how I loved him--how satin red his waistcoat was--how  large and bright his eyes--how delicate and elegant his slender legs. I  flattered him a great deal. He adored flattery and I am sure he loved me  most when I told him that it was impossible to say anything which could  flatter him. It gave him confidence in my good taste.    [Illustration: A HEAVENLY RUSH OF WINGS]    One morning--a heavenly sunny one--I was conversing with him by the  Laurette Messimys again and he was evidently much pleased with the  things I said. Perhaps he liked my hat which was a large white one with  a wreath of roses round its crown. I saw him look at it and I gently  hinted that I had worn it in the hope that he would approve. I had  broken off a handful of coral pink Laurettes and was arranging them idly  when--he spread his wings in a sudden upward flight--a tiny swift flight  which ended--among the roses on my hat--the very hat on my head.    Did I make myself still then? Did I stir by a single hairbreadth? Who  does not know? I scarcely let myself breathe. I could not believe that  such a thing of pure joy could be true.    But in a minute I realized that he at least was not afraid to move. He  was perfectly at home. He hopped about the brim and examined the roses  with delicate pecks. That I was under the hat apparently only gave him  confidence. He knew me as well as that. He stayed until he had learned  all he wished to know about garden hats and then he lightly flew away.    From that time each day drew us closer to each other. He began to perch  on twigs only a few inches from my face and listen while I whispered to  him--yes, he LISTENED and made answer with chirps. Nothing else would  describe it. As I wrote he would alight on my manuscript paper and try  to read. Sometimes I thought he was a little offended because he found  my handwriting so bad that he could not understand it. He would take  crumbs out of my hand, he would alight on my chair or my shoulder. The  instant I opened the little door in the leaf-covered garden wall I would  be greeted by the darling little rush of wings and he was beside me. And  he always came from nowhere and disappeared into space.    That, through the whole summer--was his rarest fascination. Perhaps he  was not a real robin. Perhaps he was a fairy. Who knows? Among the many  house parties staying with me he was a subject of thrilled interest.  People knew of him who had not seen him and it became a custom with  callers to say: \"May we go into the rose-garden and see The Robin?\" One  of my American guests said he was uncanny and called him \"The Goblin  Robin.\" No one had ever seen a thing so curiously human--so much more  than mere bird.    When I took callers to the rose-garden he was exquisitely polite. He  always came when I stood under my tree and called--but he never at such  times MET me with his rush to the little door. He would perch near me  and talk but there was a difference. Certain exquisite intimate charms  he kept for me alone.    I wondered when he would begin to sing. One morning the sun being strong  enough to pierce through the leaves of my tree I had a large Japanese  tent umbrella arranged so that it shaded my table as I wrote. Suddenly I  heard a robin song which sounded as if it were being trilled from some  tree at a little distance from where I sat. It was so pretty that I  leaned forward to see exactly where the singer perched. I made a  delicious discovery. He was not on a tree at all. He was perched upon  the very end of one of the bamboo ribs of my big flowery umbrella. He  was my own Robin and there he sat singing to me his first tiny  song--showing me that he had found out how to do it.    The effect of singing at a distance was produced by the curious fact  that he was singing WITH HIS BILL CLOSED, his darling scarlet throat  puffed out and tremulous with the captive trills.    Perhaps a robin's first song is always of this order. I do not know. I  only know that this was his \"earlier manner.\" My enraptured delight I  expressed to him in my most eloquent phrases. I praised him--I flattered  him. I made him believe that no robin had really ever sung before. He  was much pleased and flew down on to the table to hear all about it and  incite me to further effort.    In a few days he had learned to sing perfectly, not with the low  distant-sounding note but with open beak and clear brilliant little  roulades and trills. He grew prouder and prouder. When he saw I was busy  he would tilt on a nearby bough and call me with flirtatious,  provocative outbreaking of song. He knew that it was impossible for any  one to resist him--any one in the world. Of course I would get up and  stand beneath his tree with my face upturned and tell him that his  charm, his beauty, his fascination and my love were beyond the power of  words to express. He knew that would happen and revelled in it. His tiny  airs and graces, his devices to attract and absorb attention was  unending. He invented new ones every day and each was more enslaving  than the last.    Could it be that he was guilty--when he met other robins--of boasting of  his conquest of me and of my utter subjugation? I cannot believe it  possible. Also I never saw other robins accost him or linger in their  passage through the rose-garden to exchange civilities. And yet a very  strange thing occurred on one occasion. I was sitting at my table  expecting him and heard a familiar chirp. When I looked up he was atilt  upon the branch of an apple tree near by. I greeted him with little  whistles and twitters thinking of course that he would fly down to me  for our usual conversation. But though he chirped a reply and put his  head on one side engagingly he did not move from his bough.    \"What is the matter with you?\" I said. \"Come down--come down, little  brother!\"    But he did not come. He only sidled and twittered and stayed where he  was. This was so extraordinary that I got up and went to him. As I  looked a curious doubt came upon me. He looked like Tweetie--(which had  become his baptismal name) he tilted his head and flirted and twittered  after the manner of Tweetie--but--could it be that he was NOT what he  pretended to be? Could he be a stranger bird? That seemed out of the  question as no stranger bird would have comported himself with such  familiarity. No stranger surely would have come so near and addressed me  with such intimate twitterings and well-known airs and graces. I was  mystified beyond measure. I exerted all my powers to lure him from his  branch but descend from it he would not. He listened and smiled and  flirted his tail but he stayed where he was.    \"Listen,\" I said at last. \"I don't believe in you. There is a mystery  here. You pretend you know me and yet you act as if you were afraid of  me--just like a common bird who is made of nothing but feathers. I don't  believe you are Tweetie at all. You are an Impostor!\"    Believable or not, just at that moment when I stood there under the  bough arguing, reproaching and beguiling by turns and puzzled beyond  measure--out of the Nowhere darted a little scarlet flame of  frenzy--Tweetie himself--with his feathers ruffled and on fire with fury.  The robin on the branch actually WAS an Impostor and Tweetie had  discovered him red-breasted if not red-handed with crime. Oh! the sight  it was to behold him in his tiny Berseker rage at his impudent rival. He  flew at him, he beat him, he smacked him, he pecked him, he shrieked bad  language at him, he drove him from the branch--from the tree, from one  tree after another as the little traitor tried to take refuge--he drove  him from the rose-garden--over the laurel hedge and into the pheasant  cover in the wood. Perhaps he killed him and left him slain in the  bracken. I could not see. But having beaten him once and forever he came  back to me, panting--all fluffed up--and with blood thirst only just  dying in his eye. He came down on to my table--out of breath as he  agitatedly rearranged his untidy feathers--and indignant--almost  unreconcilable because I had been such an undiscriminating and  feeble-minded imbecile as to be for one moment deceived.    His righteous wrath was awful to behold. I was so frightened that I felt  quite pale. With those wiles of the serpent which every noble woman  finds herself forced to employ at times I endeavored to pacify him.    \"Of course I did not really believe he was You,\" I said tremulously. \"He  was your inferior in every respect. His waistcoat was not nearly so  beautiful as yours. His eyes were not so soul compelling. His legs were  not nearly so elegant and slender. And there was an expression about his  beak which I distrusted from the first. You HEARD me tell him he was an  Impostor.\"    He began to listen--he became  calmer--he relented. He kindly ate a  crumb out of my hand.    We began"]]]
