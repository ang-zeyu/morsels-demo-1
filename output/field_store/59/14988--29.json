Still he listened, not wholly  satisfied. He was never satisfied in regard to safety; he knew too well  that there never could be safety for him in this country.    The bay horse had threaded the aisles of the thicket. Duane wondered  what had drawn him there. Certainly it had not been grass, for there was  none. Presently he heard the horse tramping along, and then he ran. The  mud was deep, and the sharp thorns made going difficult. He came up  with the horse, and at the same moment crossed a multitude of fresh  horse-tracks.    He bent lower to examine them, and was alarmed to find that they had  been made very recently, even since it had ceased raining. They were  tracks of well-shod horses. Duane straightened up with a cautious glance  all around. His instant decision was to hurry back to Jennie. But he  had come a goodly way through the thicket, and it was impossible to rush  back. Once or twice he imagined he heard crashings in the brush, but  did not halt to make sure. Certain he was now that some kind of danger  threatened.    Suddenly there came an unmistakable thump of horses' hoofs off somewhere  to the fore. Then a scream rent the air. It ended abruptly. Duane leaped  forward, tore his way through the thorny brake. He heard Jennie cry  again--an appealing call quickly hushed. It seemed more to his right,  and he plunged that way. He burst into a glade where a smoldering fire  and ground covered with footprints and tracks showed that campers had  lately been. Rushing across this, he broke his passage out to the open.  But he was too late. His horse had disappeared. Jennie was gone. There  were no riders in sight. There was no sound. There was a heavy trail of  horses going north. Jennie had been carried off--probably by outlaws.  Duane realized that pursuit was out of the question--that Jennie was  lost.        CHAPTER X    A hundred miles from the haunts most familiar with Duane's deeds, far  up where the Nueces ran a trickling clear stream between yellow cliffs,  stood a small deserted shack of covered mesquite poles. It had been made  long ago, but was well preserved. A door faced the overgrown trail,  and another faced down into a gorge of dense thickets. On the border  fugitives from law and men who hid in fear of some one they had wronged  never lived in houses with only one door.    It was a wild spot, lonely, not fit for human habitation except for the  outcast. He, perhaps, might have found it hard to leave for most of the  other wild nooks in that barren country. Down in the gorge there  was never-failing sweet water, grass all the year round, cool, shady  retreats, deer, rabbits, turkeys, fruit, and miles and miles of  narrow-twisting, deep canon full of broken rocks and impenetrable  thickets. The scream of the panther was heard there, the squall of the  wildcat, the cough of the jaguar. Innumerable bees buzzed in the spring  blossoms, and, it seemed, scattered honey to the winds. All day there  was continuous song of birds, that of the mocking-bird loud and sweet  and mocking above the rest.    On clear days--and rare indeed were cloudy days--with the subsiding  of the wind at sunset a hush seemed to fall around the little hut.  Far-distant dim-blue mountains stood gold-rimmed gradually to fade with  the shading of light.    At this quiet hour a man climbed up out of the gorge and sat in the  westward door of the hut. This lonely watcher of the west and listener  to the silence was Duane. And this hut was the one where, three years  before, Jennie had nursed him back to life.    The killing of a man named Sellers, and the combination of circumstances  that had made the tragedy a memorable regret, had marked, if not a  change, at least a cessation in Duane's activities. He had trailed  Sellers to kill him for the supposed abducting of Jennie. He had trailed  him long after he had learned Sellers traveled alone. Duane wanted  absolute assurance of Jennie's death. Vague rumors, a few words here and  there, unauthenticated stories, were all Duane had gathered in years to  substantiate his belief--that Jennie died shortly after the beginning of  her second captivity. But Duane did not know surely. Sellers might have  told him. Duane expected, if not to force it from him at the end, to  read it in his eyes. But the bullet went too unerringly; it locked his  lips and fixed his eyes.    After that meeting Duane lay long at the ranchhouse of a friend, and  when he recovered from the wound Sellers had given him he started with  two horses and a pack for the lonely gorge on the Nueces. There he  had been hidden for months, a prey to remorse, a dreamer, a victim of  phantoms.    It took work for him to find subsistence in that rocky fastness. And  work, action, helped to pass the hours. But he could not work all the  time, even if he had found it to do. Then in his idle moments and at  night his task was to live with the hell in his mind.    The sunset and the twilight hour made all the rest bearable. The little  hut on the rim of the gorge seemed to hold Jennie's presence. It was not  as if he felt her spirit. If it had been he would have been sure of her  death. He hoped Jennie had not survived her second misfortune; and that  intense hope had burned into belief, if not surety. Upon his return to  that locality, on the occasion of his first visit to the hut, he had  found things just as they had left them, and a poor, faded piece of  ribbon Jennie had used to tie around her bright hair. No wandering  outlaw or traveler had happened upon the lonely spot, which further  endeared it to Duane.    A strange feature of this memory of Jennie was the freshness of it--the  failure of years, toil, strife, death-dealing to dim it--to deaden  the thought of what might have been. He had a marvelous gift of  visualization. He could shut his eyes and see Jennie before him just as  clearly as if she had stood there in the flesh. For hours he did that,  dreaming, dreaming of life he had never tasted and now never would  taste. He saw Jennie's slender, graceful figure, the old brown ragged  dress in which he had seen her first at Bland's, her little feet in  Mexican sandals, her fine hands coarsened by work, her round arms and  swelling throat, and her pale, sad, beautiful face with its staring dark  eyes. He remembered every look she had given him, every word she had  spoken to him, every time she had touched him. He thought of her beauty  and sweetness, of the few things which had come to mean to him that  she must have loved him; and he trained himself to think of these in  preference to her life at Bland's, the escape with him, and then her  recapture, because such memories led to bitter, fruitless pain. He had  to fight suffering because it was eating out his heart.    Sitting there, eyes wide open, he dreamed of the old homestead and his  white-haired mother. He saw the old home life, sweetened and filled by  dear new faces and added joys, go on before his eyes with him a part of  it.    Then in the inevitable reaction, in the reflux of bitter reality, he  would send out a voiceless cry no less poignant because it was silent:  \"Poor fool! No, I shall never see mother again--never go home--never  have a home. I am Duane, the Lone Wolf! Oh, God! I wish it were over!  These dreams torture me! What have I to do with a mother, a home, a  wife? No bright-haired boy, no dark-eyed girl will ever love me. I am  an outlaw, an outcast, dead to the good and decent world. I am  alone--alone. Better be a callous brute or better dead! I shall go mad  thinking! Man, what is left to you? A hiding-place like a wolf's--lonely  silent days, lonely nights with phantoms! Or the trail and the road with  their bloody tracks, and then the hard ride, the sleepless, hungry ride  to some hole in rocks or brakes. What hellish thing drives me? Why can't  I end it all? What is left? Only that damned unquenchable spirit of the  gun-fighter to live--to hang on to miserable life--to have no fear of  death, yet to cling like a leach--to die as gun-fighters seldom die,  with boots off! Bain, you were first, and you're long avenged. I'd  change with you. And Sellers, you were last, and you're avenged. And you  others--you're avenged. Lie quiet in your graves and give me peace!\"    But they did not lie quiet in their graves and give him peace.    A group of specters trooped out of the shadows of dusk and, gathering  round him, escorted him to his bed.    When Duane had been riding the trails passion-bent to escape pursuers,  or passion-bent in his search, the constant action and toil and  exhaustion made him sleep. But when in hiding, as time passed, gradually  he required less rest and sleep, and his mind became more active. Little  by little his phantoms gained hold on him, and at length, but for the  saving power of his dreams, they would have claimed him utterly.    How many times he had said to himself: \"I am an intelligent man. I'm  not crazy. I'm in full possession of my faculties. All this is  fancy--imagination--conscience. I've no work, no duty, no ideal, no  hope--and my mind is obsessed, thronged with images. And these images  naturally are of the men with whom I have dealt. I can't forget them.  They come back to me, hour after hour; and when my tortured mind grows  weak, then maybe I'm not just right till the mood wears out and lets me  sleep.\"    So he reasoned as he lay down in his comfortable camp. The night was  star-bright above the canon-walls, darkly shadowing down between them.  The insects hummed and chirped and thrummed a continuous thick song, low  and monotonous. Slow-running water splashed softly over stones in the  stream-bed. From far down the canon came the mournful hoot of an owl.  The moment he lay down, thereby giving up action for the day, all these  things weighed upon him like a great heavy mantle of loneliness. In  truth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#20)"],[1,"in this  room that Betty was to leave the card.    The night wind blew damp and keen, and the stars overhead seemed very far  away. Betty had no sense of fear as she began to climb, mounting slowly  and feeling for each step with her hands. The friendly dark shut in  around her and somewhere in the distance a train whistle tooted shrilly.    She knew she had reached the last step when her hands encountered wood,  and she felt about till she touched the knob of the door. It opened at  her touch and she pulled herself in over the sill.    \"Now the card,\" she whispered, feeling in her pocket.    A gust of wind fanned her cheek and something clicked.    The door had blown shut!          CHAPTER XXI    DRAMATICS      There are pleasanter places to be at midnight than the dark room of a  strange water tower, but Betty was not frightened. She tripped over some  tool as she felt for the door and discovered that she had lost her sense  of direction completely.    \"I'm all turned around,\" was the way she expressed it. \"I must start and  go around the sides, feeling till I come to the door.\"    Following this plan, she did come to the door and confidently turned the  knob. The door stuck and she rattled the knob sharply. Then the  explanation dawned on her.    The door was locked!    Could it have a spring lock? she wondered. Then she remembered a day  when, on exploration bent, a group of girls had made the trip to the roof  and the kindly Dave McGuire had taken a key from his pocket and unlocked  the door of the little room for the more adventurous ones who wanted to  climb up and see the inside.    \"It was a flat key, like a latch key,\" Betty reflected. \"The girls must  have had the door unlocked for me to-night, but I don't think they would  follow me and lock it. That would be mean!\"    However, the door was locked and she was a prisoner. It was inky black  and at every step she seemed to knock over something or stumble against  cold iron. Gradually her eyes became accustomed to the lack of light, and  she made out the outlines of something against the wall.    \"Why, there is a window--I remember!\" she said aloud. \"I wonder if I can  reach it.\"    Cautiously she felt her way around and stretched up tentative fingers.  She could barely touch the lower frame.    Then, for the first time, Betty felt a little shiver of fear and  apprehension. It was close in the tower room, and the smell of oil and  dead air began to be oppressive. She had no wish to shout, even if she  could be heard, a doubtful probability, for she had no mind to be rescued  before the curious eyes of the entire school.    \"I'll get out of it somehow, if I have to stay here all night,\" she told  herself pluckily. \"Oh, my goodness, what was that?\"    A tiny sawing noise in one corner of the room sent Betty scurrying to  the other side. She would have indignantly denied any fear of mice or  rats, but the bravest girl might be excused from a too close  acquaintance thrust upon her in the dark. Betty had no wish to put her  fingers on a mouse.    \"How can I get out?\" she cried aloud, a little wildly. \"I can't breathe!\"    In the uncanny silence that followed the sound of her voice, the sawing  noise sounded regularly, rhythmically. In desperation Betty seized an  iron crowbar she had backed into on the wall, and hurled it in the  direction of the industrious rodents.    \"Now I've done it,\" she admitted, as with a clatter and a bang that, she  was sure, could be heard a mile away, an evident avalanche of tools  tumbled to the floor. Her crowbar had struck a box of tools.    But the silence shut down again after that. Betty did not realize that  the water tower was so isolated that even unusual noises inside it would  not carry far, and with the door and the window both closed the room was  practically sealed.    The sawing noise was not repeated, there was that much to be grateful  for, Betty reflected. She wondered if she could batter down the door.    \"I'll try, anyway,\" she thought wearily.    And then she could not find the crowbar! Around and around she went,  feeling on the floor for the tools that had clattered down with such a  racket and for the iron bar she had hurled among them. Not one tool could  she put her hands on.    \"I must be going crazy,\" she cried in despair. \"I couldn't have dreamed  those tools fell down, and yet where could they have gone? There's no  hole in the floor--\"    Now Betty's nerves were sorely tried by the lonely imprisonment, the bad  air, the heat, and the darkness, and it is not to be wondered at that her  usual sound common sense was tricked by her imagination. Her fancy  suggested that the weight of the tools might have torn a hole in the  floor, they might have dropped through to the roof, and Betty herself  might be in momentary danger of stepping into this hole.    Nonsense? Well, wiser minds have conceived wilder possibilities under  similar trying conditions.    \"I won't walk another step!\" cried poor Betty, as she visioned this  yawning hole. \"Not another step. I'll wait till it's light.\"    But she waited, fifteen, twenty, thirty minutes, and the darkness if  anything grew blacker. She had no idea how long she had been locked in  the room, and she could not calculate how far off the morning might be.    \"I'll put my hands out before me and creep,\" she said finally. \"That  ought to be safe. Perhaps I can find something to stand on to reach that  window. I guess I could drop to the roof from there.\"    Stiffly and painfully, she began to crawl, holding out her hands before  her and starting back time and again as she fancied she felt an opening  just ahead. But when she brought up against a step ladder she forgot her  fears in the joy of her discovery.    It was a short ladder, but she dragged it over to the window and put it  in place and mounted it, all in the twinkling of an eye. By stretching to  her full height, she was able to raise the creaky window, but to her  dismay the roof offered a very long drop. She had not realized how high  she had climbed.    \"Dave was fussing with ropes and buckets the other day,\" she recalled.  \"Now I wonder--wouldn't it be the best luck in the world if I could  find a rope?\"    Hope was singing high in her heart now, but she almost despaired of such  good fortune after a diligent search. Then something told her to feel  about again on the floor. Round and round she went, getting her fingers  into spider webs and sticky substances that renewed her inward shudders  because she could not identify them. And when she found the rope, a tarry  coil, she also solved the mystery of the tools. They had fallen down  behind the coil of rope and were effectively fenced off from the circle  of floor explored by the bewildered Betty.    It was the work of a moment to tie one end of the rope to a heavy staple  driven under the window sill, and then, closing her eyes to the pitch  black void beneath her, Betty let herself slide down to the roof. Her  hands were cruelly scratched by the rope fibres and she was too tired to  care about the evidences of her flight.    \"If anybody wants to know about that rope and the locked door, let 'em!\"  she sighed defiantly.    Bobby woke up as Betty came in the door, and then there were questions  galore to be answered. Betty was covered with dust and her clothing was  torn and rumpled. Bobby declared she looked as if she had been to war.    \"I feel it,\" admitted Betty. \"Let me take a hot bath and get into bed.  And, Bobby, promise me on your word of honor that you'll call me in the  morning. Whoever locked me in expects me to stay there till I'm missed,  and I want to walk into breakfast as usual.\"    She half regretted her instructions when Bobby called her at seven the  next morning, but Betty was nothing if not gritty, and she sleepily  struggled into her clothes. Ada Nansen's look of utter astonishment when  she saw Betty come into the dining room with the rest for breakfast told  those in the secret what they had already suspected.    \"Bobby must have heard her listening at our door last night,\" said  Betty. \"What am I going to do? Why nothing, of course! That was part of  the stunt, or at least I'm going to consider it so. My card is there, so  they'll know I fulfilled my part.\"    Dave McGuire scratched his head when he found the rope and the open  window, but he wisely said nothing. He had two keys, and one he had  loaned at the request of the senior class president to a fellow student.  The other key, for emergency use, hung on a nail in the fourth story  hall. That was the key Dave found in the door lock when he made his early  morning tour of inspection. \"But the young folks must be having their  fun,\" he said indulgently, \"and, short of burning down the place, 'tis  not Dave McGuire who will be interfering with 'em.\"    Mid-term tests were approaching. Bobby, who, with all her love of fun,  was a hard student, felt prepared and went around serenely. Constance  Howard had, most humanly, neglected, so far as the teacher of mathematics  permitted, the study that was hardest for her, her algebra. She now spent  hours in \"cramming\" on this, meanwhile complaining to those of her  special chums who would listen to her of \"the unfairness of being made to  study algebra.\"    \"I can add--with the use of my fingers--and subtract and divide and  multiply--at least I know the tables up through the twelves. Of what use  will a's and b's and x's, y's and z's ever be to me?\"    \"Constance, you know that's nonsense,\" Bobby told her. \"We're every one  of us here because we want to play a bigger part in life than the  two-plus-two-is-four people, and we've got to dig in and prepare  ourselves. If you'd do your work when you ought to, you wouldn't be in  such an upset state now.\"    \"Yes'm,\" grinned Constance, and went back to her belated work.    Betty had found that her year away from school had made it hard for her  to concentrate her mind on"]]]
