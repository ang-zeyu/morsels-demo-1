The dispute between England and the United States of America, though not  strictly a family quarrel, had many of the features of a civil war. The  people of the latter were never properly and constitutionally subject to  the people of the former, but the inhabitants of both countries owed  allegiance to a common king. The Americans, as a nation, disavowed this  allegiance, and the English choosing to support their sovereign in the  attempt to regain his power, most of the feelings of an internal  struggle were involved in the conflict. A large proportion of the  emigrants from Europe, then established in the colonies, took part with  the crown; and there were many districts in which their influence,  united to that of the Americans who refused to lay aside their  allegiance, gave a decided preponderance to the royal cause. America was  then too young, and too much in need of every heart and hand, to regard  these partial divisions, small as they were in actual amount, with  indifference. The evil was greatly increased by the activity of the  English in profiting by these internal dissensions; and it became doubly  serious when it was found that attempts were made to raise various corps  of provincial troops, who were to be banded with those from Europe, to  reduce the young republic to subjection. Congress named an especial and  a secret committee, therefore, for the express purpose of defeating this  object. Of this committee Mr.----, the narrator of the anecdote,  was chairman.    In the discharge of the novel duties which now devolved on him, Mr.----  had occasion to employ an agent whose services differed but little from  those of a common spy. This man, as will easily be understood, belonged  to a condition in life which rendered him the least reluctant to appear  in so equivocal a character. He was poor, ignorant, so far as the usual  instruction was concerned; but cool, shrewd, and fearless by nature. It  was his office to learn in what part of the country the agents of the  crown were making their efforts to embody men, to repair to the place,  enlist, appear zealous in the cause he affected to serve, and otherwise  to get possession of as many of the secrets of the enemy as possible.  The last he of course communicated to his employers, who took all the  means in their power to counteract the plans of the English, and  frequently with success.    It will readily be conceived that a service like this was attended with  great personal hazard. In addition to the danger of discovery, there was  the daily risk of falling into the hands of the Americans themselves,  who invariably visited sins of this nature more severely on the natives  of the country than on the Europeans who fell into their hands. In fact,  the agent of Mr. ---- was several times arrested by the local  authorities; and, in one instance, he was actually condemned by his  exasperated countrymen to the gallows. Speedy and private orders to the  jailer alone saved him from an ignominious death. He was permitted to  escape; and this seeming and indeed actual peril was of great aid in  supporting his assumed character among the English. By the Americans, in  his little sphere, he was denounced as a bold and inveterate Tory. In  this manner he continued to serve his country in secret during the early  years of the struggle, hourly environed by danger, and the constant  subject of unmerited opprobrium.    In the year ---, Mr. ---- was named to a high and honorable employment  at a European court. Before vacating his seat in Congress, he reported  to that body an outline of the circumstances related, necessarily  suppressing the name of his agent, and demanding an appropriation in  behalf of a man who had been of so much use, at so great risk. A  suitable sum was voted; and its delivery was confided to the chairman of  the secret committee.    Mr. ---- took the necessary means to summon his agent to a personal  interview. They met in a wood at midnight. Here Mr. ---- complimented  his companion on his fidelity and adroitness; explained the necessity of  their communications being closed; and finally tendered the money. The  other drew back, and declined receiving it. \"The country has need of all  its means,\" he said; \"as for myself, I can work, or gain a livelihood in  various ways.\" Persuasion was useless, for patriotism was uppermost in  the heart of this remarkable individual; and Mr. ---- departed, bearing  with him the gold he had brought, and a deep respect for the man who had  so long hazarded his life, unrequited, for the cause they served  in common.    The writer is under an impression that, at a later day, the agent of  Mr. ---- consented to receive a remuneration for what he had done; but it  was not until his country was entirely in a condition to bestow it.    It is scarcely necessary to add, that an anecdote like this, simply but  forcibly told by one of its principal actors, made a deep impression on  all who heard it. Many years later, circumstances, which it is  unnecessary to relate, and of an entirely adventitious nature, induced  the writer to publish a novel, which proved to be, what he little  foresaw at the time, the first of a tolerably long series. The same  adventitious causes which gave birth to the book determined its scene  and its general character. The former was laid in a foreign country; and  the latter embraced a crude effort to describe foreign manners. When  this tale was published, it became matter of reproach among the author's  friends, that he, an American in heart as in birth, should give to the  world a work which aided perhaps, in some slight degree, to feed the  imaginations of the young and unpracticed among his own countrymen, by  pictures drawn from a state of society so different from that to which  he belonged. The writer, while he knew how much of what he had done was  purely accidental, felt the reproach to be one that, in a measure, was  just. As the only atonement in his power, he determined to inflict a  second book, whose subject should admit of no cavil, not only on the  world, but on himself. He chose patriotism for his theme; and to those  who read this introduction and the book itself, it is scarcely necessary  to add, that he took the hero of the anecdote just related as the best  illustration of his subject.    Since the original publication of _The Spy_, there have appeared several  accounts of different persons who are supposed to have been in the  author's mind while writing the book. As Mr. ---- did not mention the  name of his agent, the writer never knew any more of his identity with  this or that individual, than has been here explained. Both Washington  and Sir Henry Clinton had an unusual number of secret emissaries; in a  war that partook so much of a domestic character, and in which the  contending parties were people of the same blood and language, it could  scarcely be otherwise.    The style of the book has been revised by the author in this edition. In  this respect, he has endeavored to make it more worthy of the favor with  which it has been received; though he is compelled to admit there are  faults so interwoven with the structure of the tale that, as in the case  of a decayed edifice, it would cost perhaps less to reconstruct than to  repair. Five-and-twenty years have been as ages with most things  connected with America. Among other advantages, that of her literature  has not been the least. So little was expected from the publication of  an original work of this description, at the time it was written, that  the first volume of _The Spy_ was actually printed several months,  before the author felt a sufficient inducement to write a line of the  second. The efforts expended on a hopeless task are rarely worthy of him  who makes them, however low it may be necessary to rate the standard of  his general merit.    One other anecdote connected with the history of this book may give the  reader some idea of the hopes of an American author, in the first  quarter of the present century. As the second volume was slowly  printing, from manuscript that was barely dry when it went into the  compositor's hands, the publisher intimated that the work might grow to  a length that would consume the profits. To set his mind at rest, the  last chapter was actually written, printed, and paged, several weeks  before the chapters which precede it were even thought of. This  circumstance, while it cannot excuse, may serve to explain the manner in  which the actors are hurried off the scene.    A great change has come over the country since this book was originally  written. The nation is passing from the gristle into the bone, and the  common mind is beginning to keep even pace with the growth of the body  politic. The march from Vera Cruz to Mexico was made under the orders of  that gallant soldier who, a quarter of a century before, was mentioned  with honor, in the last chapter of this very book. Glorious as was that  march, and brilliant as were its results in a military point of view, a  stride was then made by the nation, in a moral sense, that has hastened  it by an age, in its progress toward real independence and high  political influence. The guns that filled the valley of the Aztecs with  their thunder, have been heard in echoes on the other side of the  Atlantic, producing equally hope or apprehension.    There is now no enemy to fear, but the one that resides within. By  accustoming ourselves to regard even the people as erring beings, and by  using the restraints that wisdom has adduced from experience, there is  much reason to hope that the same Providence which has so well aided us  in our infancy, may continue to smile on our manhood.

(_For the Mirror._)      In the twenty-third year of the reign of king Henry III., the salary of  the justices of the bench (now called the Common Pleas) was 20l. per  annum; in the forty-third year, 40l. In the twenty-seventh year, the  chief baron had 40 marks; the other barons, 20 marks; and in the forty,  ninth year, 4l. per annum. The justices _coram rege_ (now called the  King's Bench) had in the forty-third year of Henry III. 40l. per annum.;  the chief of the bench, 100 marks per annum; and next year, another  chief of the same court, had 100l.; but the chief of the court _coram  rege_ had only 100 marks per annum.    In the reign of Edward I., the salaries of the justices were very  uncertain, and, upon the whole, they sunk from what they had been in the  reign of Henry III. The chief justice of the bench, in the seventh year  of Edward I., had but 40l. per annum, and the other justices there, 40  marks. This continued the proportion in both benches till the  twenty-fifth year of Edward III., then the salary of the chief of the  King's Bench fell to 50 marks, or 33l. 6s. 8d., while that of the chief  of the bench was augmented to 100 marks, which may be considered as an  evidence of the increase of business and attendance there. The chief  baron had 40l.; the salaries of the other justices and barons were  reduced to 20l.    In the reign of Edward II., the number of suitors so increased in the  common bench, that whereas there had usually been only three justices  there, that prince, at the beginning of his reign, was constrained to  increase them to six, who used to sit in two places,--a circumstance not  easy to be accounted for. Within three years after they were increased  to seven; next year they were reduced to six, at which number they  continued.    The salaries of the judges, though they had continued the same from the  time of Edward I. to the twenty-fifth year of Edward III., were become  very uncertain. In the twenty-eighth year of this king, it appears, that  one of the justices of the King's Bench had 80 marks per annum. In the  thirty-ninth year of Edward III. the judges had in that court 40l.; the  same as the justices of the Common Pleas; but the chief of the King's  Bench, 100 marks.    The salaries of the judges in the time of Henry IV. were as  follows:--The chief baron, and other barons, had 40 marks per annum; the  chief of the King's Bench, and of the Common Pleas, 40l. per annum; the  other justices, in either court, 40 marks. But the gains of the  practisers were become so great, that they could hardly be tempted to  accept a place on the bench with such low salaries; therefore in the  eighteenth year of Henry VI. the judges of all the courts at  Westminster, together with the king's attorney and sergeants, exhibited  a petition to parliament concerning the regular payment of their  salaries and perquisites of robes. The king assented to their request,  and order was taken for increasing their income, which afterwards became  larger, and more fixed; this consisted of a salary and an allowance for  robes. In the first year of Edward IV., the chief justice of the King's  Bench had 170 marks per annum, 5l. 6s. 6d. for his winter robes, and the  same for his Whitsuntide robes. Most of the judges had the honour of  knighthood; some of them were knights bannerets; and some had the order  of the Bath.    In the first year of Henry VII. the chief justice of the court of King's  Bench had the yearly fee of 140 marks granted to him for his better  support; he had besides 5l. 6s. 11-1/4 d., and the sixth part of a  halfpenny (such is the accuracy of Sir William Dugdale, and the  strangeness of the sum,) for his winter robes, and 3l. 6s. 6d. for his  robes at Whitsuntide.    In the thirty-seventh year of Henry VIII. a further increase was made to  the fees of the judges;--to the chief justice of the King's Bench 30l.  per annum; to every other justice of that court 20l. per annum; to every  justice of the Common Pleas, 20l. per annum.    There were usually in the court of Common Pleas five judges, sometimes  six; and in the reign of Henry VI. there were, it is said, eight judges  at one time in that court; but six appear to have been the regular  number. In the King's Bench there were sometimes four, sometimes five.  They did not sit above three hours a day in court,--from eight in the  morning to eleven. The courts were not open in the afternoon; but that  time was left unoccupied for suitors to confer with their counsel  at home.    F. R.

Sir Walter Scott, the author of _Waverley_, has become the biographer of  Napoleon Bonaparte; and the deepest interest is excited in the literary  world to know how the great master of romance and fiction acquits  himself in the execution of his task. In the preface to this elaborate  history, Sir Walter, with considerable ingenuousness, informs us that  \"he will be found no enemy to the person of Napoleon. The term of  hostility is ended when the battle has been won, and the foe exists no  longer.\" But to our task: we shall attempt an analysis of the volumes  before us, and endeavour to gratify our readers with a narrative of  incidents that cannot fail interesting every British subject, whose  history, in fact, is strongly connected with the important events that  belong to the splendid career of Napoleon Bonaparte.    The first and second volumes of Sir Walter's history are taken up with a  view of the French Revolution, from whence we shall extract a sketch of  the characters of three men of terror, whose names will long remain, we  trust, unmatched in history by those of any similar miscreants. These  men were the leaders of the revolution, and were called    THE TRIUMVIRATE.    Danton deserves to be named first, as unrivalled by his colleagues in  talent and audacity. He was a man of gigantic size, and possessed a  voice of thunder. His countenance was that of an Ogre on the shoulders  of a Hercules. He was as fond of the pleasures of vice as of the  practice of cruelty; and it was said there were times when he became  humanized amidst his debauchery, laughed at the terror which his furious  declamations excited, and might be approached with safety, like the  Maelstrom at the turn of tide. His profusion was indulged to an extent  hazardous to his popularity, for the populace are jealous of a lavish  expenditure, as raising their favourites too much above their own  degree; and the charge of peculation finds always ready credit with  them, when brought against public men.    Robespierre possessed this advantage over Danton, that he did not seem  to seek for wealth, either for hoarding or expending, but lived in  strict and economical retirement, to justify the name of the  Incorruptible, with which he was honoured by his partizans. He appears  to have possessed little talent, saving a deep fund of hypocrisy,  considerable powers of sophistry, and a cold exaggerated strain of  oratory, as foreign to good taste, as the measures he recommended were  to ordinary humanity. It seemed wonderful, that even the seething and  boiling of the revolutionary cauldron should have sent up from the  bottom, and long supported on the surface, a thing so miserably void of  claims to public distinction; but Robespierre had to impose on the minds  of the vulgar, and he knew how to beguile them, by accommodating his  flattery to their passions and scale of understanding, and by acts of  cunning and hypocrisy, which weigh more with the multitude than the  words of eloquence, or the arguments of wisdom. The people listened as  to their Cicero, when he twanged out his apostrophes of _Pauvre Peuple,  Peuple vertueux!_ and hastened to execute whatever came recommended by  such honied phrases, though devised by the worst of men for the worst  and most inhuman of purposes.    Vanity was Robespierre's ruling passion, and though his countenance was  the image of his mind, he was vain even of his personal appearance, and  never adopted the external habits of a sans culotte. Amongst his fellow  Jacobins, he was distinguished by the nicety with which his hair was  arranged and powdered; and the neatness of his dress was carefully  attended to, so as to counterbalance, if possible, the vulgarity of his  person. His apartments, though small, were elegant and vanity had filled  them with representations of the occupant. Robespierre's picture at  length hung in one place, his miniature in another, his bust occupied a  niche, and on the table were disposed a few medallions exhibiting his  head in profile. The vanity which all this indicated was of the coldest  and most selfish character, being such as considers neglect as insult,  and receives homage merely as a tribute; so that, while praise is  received without gratitude, it is withheld at the risk of mortal hate.
