INTRODUCTION    LECTURE I    DESCENT: THEORIES OF EVOLUTION  AND METHODS OF INVESTIGATION    Newton convinced his contemporaries that natural laws rule the whole  universe. Lyell showed, by his principle of slow and gradual evolution,  that natural laws have reigned since the beginning of time. To Darwin we  owe the almost universal acceptance of the theory of descent.    This doctrine is one of the most noted landmarks in the advance of  science. It teaches the validity of natural laws of life in its broadest  sense, and crowns the philosophy founded by Newton and Lyell.    Lamarck proposed the hypothesis of a common origin of all living beings  and this ingenious and thoroughly philosophical conception was warmly  welcomed by his partisans, but was not widely accepted owing to lack of  supporting evidence. To Darwin was reserved the task of [2] bringing the  theory of common descent to its present high rank in scientific and  social philosophy.    Two main features in his work have contributed to this early and  unexpected victory. One of them is the almost unlimited amount of  comparative evidence, the other is his demonstration of the possibility  of a physiological explanation of the process of descent itself.    The universal belief in the independent creation of living organisms was  revised by Linnaeus and was put upon a new foundation. Before him the  genera were supposed to be created, the species and minor forms having  arisen from them through the agency of external conditions. In his first  book Linnaeus adhered to this belief, but later changed his mind and  maintained the principle of the separate creation of species. The weight  of his authority soon brought this conception to universal acceptance,  and up to the present time the prevailing conception of a species has  been chiefly based on the definition given by Linnaeus. His species  comprised subspecies and varieties, which were in their turn, supposed  to have evolved from species by the common method.    Darwin tried to show that the links which bind species to genera are of  the same nature as those which determine the relationship of [3]  subspecies and varieties. If an origin by natural laws is conceded for  the latter, it must on this ground be granted for the first also. In  this discussion he simply returned to the pre-Linnean attitude. But his  material was such as to allow him to go one step further, and this step  was an important and decisive one. He showed that the relation between  the various genera of a family does not exhibit any features of a nature  other than that between the species of a genus. What has been conceded  for the one must needs be accepted for the other. The same holds good  for the large groups.    The conviction of the common origin of closely allied forms necessarily  leads to the conception of a similar descent even in remote  relationships.    The origin of subspecies and varieties as found in nature was not  proved, but only generally recognized as evident. A broader knowledge  has brought about the same state of opinion for greater groups of  relationships. Systematic affinities find their one possible explanation  by the aid of this principle; without it, all similarity is only  apparent and accidental. Geographic and paleontologic facts, brought  together by Darwin and others on a previously unequalled scale, point  clearly in the same direction. The vast amount of evidence of all [4]  comparative sciences compels us to accept the idea. To deny it, is to  give up all opportunity of conceiving Nature in her true form.    The general features of the theory of descent are now accepted as the  basis of all biological science. Half a century of discussion and  investigation has cleared up the minor points and brought out an  abundance of facts; but they have not changed the principle.

PAGE FROM LISSAUER'S PAMPHLET SHOWING \"HYMN OF HATE\".    INSTRUCTIONS REGULATING APPEARANCE AT COURT.    A BERLIN EXTRA.            CHAPTER I    MY FIRST YEAR IN GERMANY    The second day out on the _Imperator_, headed for a summer's  vacation, a loud knocking woke me at seven A. M. The radio, handed  in from a friend in New York, told me of my appointment as Ambassador  to Germany.    Many friends were on the ship. Henry Morgenthau, later Ambassador  to Turkey, Colonel George Harvey, Adolph Ochs and Louis Wiley  of the _New York Times_, Clarence Mackay, and others.    The _Imperator_ is a marvellous ship of fifty-four thousand  tons or more, and at times it is hard to believe that one is  on the sea. In addition to the regular dining saloon, there is  a grill room and Ritz restaurant with its palm garden, and, of  course, an Hungarian Band. There are also a gymnasium and swimming  pool, and, nightly, in the enormous ballroom dances are given,  the women dressing in their best just as they do on shore.    Colonel Harvey and Clarence Mackay gave me a dinner of twenty-four  covers, something of a record at sea. For long afterwards in  Germany, I saw everywhere pictures of the _Imperator_ including  one of the tables set for this dinner. These were sent out over  Germany as a sort of propaganda to induce the Germans to patronise  their own ships and indulge in ocean travel. I wish that the  propaganda had been earlier and more successful, because it is  by travel that peoples learn to know each other, and consequently  to abstain from war.    On the night of the usual ship concert, Henry Morgenthau translated  a little speech for me into German, which I managed to get through  after painfully learning it by heart. Now that I have a better  knowledge of German, a cold sweat breaks out when I think of  the awful German accent with which I delivered that address.    A flying trip to Berlin early in August to look into the house  question followed, and then I returned to the United States.    In September I went to Washington to be \"instructed,\" talked  with the President and Secretary, and sat at the feet of the  Assistant Secretary of State, Alvey A. Adee, the revered Sage  of the Department of State.    On September ninth, 1913, having resigned as Justice of the Supreme  Court of the State of New York, I sailed for Germany, stopping on  the way in London in order to make the acquaintance of Ambassador  Page, certain wise people in Washington having expressed the  belief that a personal acquaintance of our Ambassadors made it  easier for them to work together.    Two cares assail a newly appointed Ambassador. He must first  take thought of what he shall wear and where he shall live. All  other nations have beautiful Embassies or Legations in Berlin,  but I found that my two immediate predecessors had occupied a  villa originally built as a two-family house, pleasantly enough  situated, but two miles from the centre of Berlin and entirely  unsuitable for an Embassy.    There are few private houses in Berlin, most of the people living  in apartments. After some trouble I found a handsome house on  the Wilhelm Platz immediately opposite the Chancellor's palace  and the Foreign Office, in the very centre of Berlin. This house  had been built as a palace for the Princes Hatzfeld and had later  passed into the possession of a banking family named von Schwabach.    The United States Government, unlike other nations, does not  own or pay the rent of a suitable Embassy, but gives allowance  for offices, if the house is large enough to afford office room  for the office force of the Embassy. The von Schwabach palace  was nothing but a shell. Even the gas and electric light fixtures  had been removed; and when the hot water and heating system,  bath-rooms, electric lights and fixtures, etc., had been put  in, and the house furnished from top to bottom, my first year's  salary had far passed the minus point.    The palace was not ready for occupancy until the end of January,  1914, and, in the meantime, we lived at the Hotel Esplanade,  and I transacted business at the old, two-family villa.    There are more diplomats in Berlin than in any other capital in  the world, because each of the twenty-five States constituting  the German Empire sends a legation to Berlin; even the free cities  of Hamburg, Lübeck and Bremen have a resident minister at the  Empire's capital.    Invariable custom requires a new Ambassador in Berlin to give  two receptions, one to the Diplomatic Corps and the other to  all those people who have the right to go to court. These are  the officials, nobles and officers of the army and navy, and  such other persons as have been presented at court. Such people  are called _hoffähig_, meaning that they are fit for court.    [Illustration: AMBASSADOR GERARD ON HIS WAY TO PRESENT HIS LETTERS  OF CREDENCE TO THE EMPEROR.]    [Illustration: THE HOUSE ON THE WILHELM PLATZ, RENTED FOR USE  AS THE EMBASSY.]    It is interesting here to note that Jews are not admitted to  court. Such Jews as have been ennobled and allowed to put the  coveted \"von\" before their names have first of all been required  to submit to baptism in some Christian church. Examples are the  von Schwabach family, whose ancestral house I occupied in Berlin,  and Friedlaender-Fuld, officially rated as the richest man in  Berlin, who made a large fortune in coke and its by-products.    These two receptions are really introductions of an Ambassador  to official and court society.    Before these receptions, however, and in the month of November,  I presented my letters of credence as Ambassador to the Emperor.  This presentation is quite a ceremony. Three coaches were sent  for me and my staff, coaches like that in which Cinderella goes  to her ball, mostly glass, with white wigged coachmen, outriders  in white wigs and standing footmen holding on to the back part  of the coach. Baron von Roeder, introducer of Ambassadors, came  for me and accompanied me in the first coach; the men of the  Embassy staff sat in the other two coaches. Our little procession  progressed solemnly through the streets of Berlin, passing on  the way through the centre division of the arch known as the  Brandenburger Thor, the gateway that stands at the head of the  Unter den Linden, a privilege given only on this occasion.    We mounted long stairs in the palace, and in a large room were  received by the aides and the officers of the Emperor's household,  of course all in uniform. Then I was ushered alone into the adjoining  room where the Emperor, very erect and dressed in the black uniform  of the Death's Head Hussars, stood by a table. I made him a little  speech, and presented my letters of credence and the letters  of recall of my predecessor. The Emperor then unbent from his  very erect and impressive attitude and talked with me in a very  friendly manner, especially impressing me with his interest in  business and commercial affairs. I then, in accordance with custom,  asked leave to present my staff. The doors were opened. The staff  came in and were presented to the Emperor, who talked in a very  jolly and agreeable way to all of us, saying that he hoped above  all to see the whole of the Embassy staff riding in the Tier  Garten in the mornings.    The Emperor is a most impressive figure, and, in his black uniform  surrounded by his officers, certainly looked every inch a king.  Although my predecessors, on occasions of this kind, had worn a  sort of fancy diplomatic uniform designed by themselves, I decided  to abandon this and return to the democratic, if unattractive and  uncomfortable, dress-suit, simply because the newspapers of America  and certain congressmen, while they have had no objection to the  wearing of uniforms by the army and navy, police and postmen,  and do not expect officers to lead their troops into battle in  dress-suits, have, nevertheless, had a most extraordinary prejudice  against American diplomats following the usual custom of adopting  a diplomatic uniform.    Some days after my presentation to the Emperor, I was taken to  Potsdam, which is situated about half an hour's train journey from  Berlin, and, from the station there, driven to the new palace and  presented to the Empress. The Empress was most charming and affable,  and presented a very distinguished appearance. Accompanied by Mrs.  Gerard, and always, either by night or by day, in the infernal  dress-suit, I was received by the Crown Prince and Princess, and  others of the royal princes and their wives. On these occasions  we sat down and did not stand, as when received by the Emperor  and Empress, and simply made \"polite conversation\" for about  twenty minutes, being received first by the ladies-in-waiting  and aides. These princes were always in uniform of some kind.    At the reception for the _hoffähig_ people Mrs. Gerard stood  in one room and I in another, and with each of us was a  representative of the Emperor's household to introduce the people  of the court, and an army officer to introduce the people of the  army. The officer assigned to me had the extraordinary name of  der Pfortner von der Hoelle, which means the \"porter of Hell.\"  I have often wondered since by what prophetic instinct he was  sent to introduce me to the two years and a half of world war  which I experienced in Berlin. This unfortunate officer, a most  charming gentleman, was killed early in the war.    The Berlin season lasts from about the twentieth of January for  about six weeks. It is short in duration because, if the  _hoffähig_ people stay longer than six weeks in Berlin, they  become liable to pay their local income tax in Berlin, where  the rate "]]]
