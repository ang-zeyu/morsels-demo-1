Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate  of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).  Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities  are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller  entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The  Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).    Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per  1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. Dates of  information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1995 is  used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are  estimates for 1 July 1995, with population growth rates estimated for  calendar year 1995. Major political events have been updated through  April 1995.    Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per  l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.    Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter \"country code\" that precisely  identifies every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF,  for example, is the digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized  geopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information  Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-3 by the National Bureau of  Standards (now called National Institute of Standards and Technology)  at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the  Geographer at the US Department of State. The digraph is used to  eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,  and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for  interchanging data between databases.    Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations  with 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN  members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,  and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with  6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,  Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.    Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official  development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is  defined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,  has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of  LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions  are also official government assistance, but with a main objective  other than development and with a grant element less than 25%. OOF  transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank  credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt  reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional  terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are  initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration  of intent.    Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. \"Nation\" refers to a people politically organized into a  sovereign state with a definite territory. \"Dependent area\" refers to  a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way  with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form  names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 266  entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:    NATIONS  184 -- UN members (excluding the former Yugoslavia, which is still      counted by the UN)      7 -- nations that are not members of the UN--Holy See, Kiribati,      Nauru, Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu    OTHER  1 -- Taiwan    DEPENDENT AREAS  6 -- Australia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos      (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald      Islands, Norfolk Island      2 -- Denmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland      16 -- France--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island,      French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic      Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island,      Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre and      Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna      2 -- Netherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles      3 -- New Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau      3 -- Norway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard      1 -- Portugal--Macau      16 -- United Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean      Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland      Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Isle of Man,      Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, South Georgia and the      South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands      14 -- United States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland      Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway      Islands, Navassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll,      Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Wake Island    MISCELLANEOUS  6 -- Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West      Bank, Western Sahara    OTHER ENTITIES  4 -- oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean        1 -- World      266 -- total    Exchange rate:  The official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over  a given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US  dollar and as determined by international market forces or official  fiat.    GDP methodology: In the \"Economy\" section, GDP dollar estimates for  all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)  calculations rather than from conversions at official currency  exchange rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of  international dollar price weights, which are applied to the  quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In  addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries,  the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,  and allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a  GDP estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in  dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand  dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one  thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP  conversion rate - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates  for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing  countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates  are based on extrapolation of numbers published by the UN  International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and  Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.  Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and  domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic  output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate  estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP  estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by  10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real  output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14  countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are  tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,  of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One  important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a  percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially  from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,  for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of  Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP  and other economic data can not be chained together from successive  volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring  rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or  different sources of information, and changes in national statistical  methods and practices.    Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year.    Gross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production.    Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and  services produced worldwide in a given year.    Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,  resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the  balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be  positive or negative.    Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,  stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis.  These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by  doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical  channels.  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).  Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the  stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,  which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,  and cocoa butter.  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5710"],[0,"A Dissertation on Horses (#2)"],[1,"made in  those parts which are immediately conducive to action; if his  shoulders incline well backwards, his legs and joints in  proportion, his carcase strong and deep, his thighs well let down,  we shall find he may be a very good racer, even when tried by the  principles of mechanics, without appealing to his blood for any  part of his goodness. We are taught by this doctrine of mechanics,  that the power applied to any body, must be adequate to the weight  of that body, otherwise, such power will be deficient for the  action we require; and there is no man but knows a cable or chord  of three inches diameter is not equal in strength to a chord of  four inches diameter. So that if it should be asked why a handsome  coach Horse, with as much beauty, length, and proportion as a  foreign Horse, will not act with the same velocity and  perseverance, nothing will be more easily answered, without  appealing to blood; because we shall find the powers of acting in  a foreign Horse much more prevalent, and more equal to the weight  of his body, than the powers of acting in a coach Horse: for  whoever has been curious enough to examine the mechanism of  different Horses by dissection, will find the tendon of the leg in  a foreign Hose is much larger than in any other Horse, whose leg  is of the same dimensions; and as the external texture of a  foreign Horse is much finer than of any other, so the foreign  Horse must necessarily have the greatest strength and perseverance  in acting, because the muscular power of two Horses (whose  dimensions are the same) will be the greatest in that Horse, whose  texture is the finest.    Let us next inquire what information we can gather from the  science of Anatomy, concerning the laws of motion: it teaches us,  that the force and power of a muscle consists in the number of  fibres of which it is composed; and that the velocity and motion  of a muscle consists in the length and extent of its fibres. Let  us compare this doctrine with the language of the jockey: he tells  us, if a Horse has not length, he will be slow; and if made to  slender, he will not be able to bring his weight through.  Does  not the observation of the jockey exactly correspond with this  doctrine? If we now inquire into the motion of Horses, we shall  find the bones are the levers of the body, and the tendons and  muscles (which are one and the same thing) are the powers of  acting applied to these levers. Now when we consider a half-bred  Horse running one mile or more, with the same velocity as a Horse  of foreign extraction, we do not impute that equality of velocity  to any innate quality in the half-bred Horse, because we can  account for it by external causes: that is by an equality of the  length, and extent of his levers and tendons. And when we consider  a half-bred Horse running one mile, or more, with the same  velocity as the other, and then giving it up, what shall we do?  shall we say the foreigner beats him by his blood, or by the force  and power of his tendons? or can we, without reproaching our own  reason and understanding, impute that to be the effect of occult  and hidden causes in the one of these instances and not in the  other? both of which are demonstrated with certainty, and reduced  to facts by the knowledge of anatomy and the principles of  mechanics.    How many instances have we of different Horses beating each other  alternately over different sorts of ground! how often do we see  short, close, compact Horses beating others of a more lengthened  shape, over high and hilly coursed, as well as deep and slippery  ground; in the latter of which, the blood is esteemed much better,  and whose performances in general are much better!    And how comes it to pass that Horses of a more lengthened shape,  have a superiority over Horses of a shorter make, upon level and  flat courses? Is this effected by the difference of their  mechanical powers, or is it affected by the blood? if, by the  latter, then this blood is not general, but partial only, which no  reasoning man will be absurd enough to allow. But I much fear our  distinctions of good and bad blood are determined with much  partiality; for every jockey has his particular favourite blood,  of which he judges from events, success, or prejudice: else, how  comes it to pass, that we see the different opinions and fashions  of blood varying daily! nay, we see the very same blood undergoing  the very same fate; this year rejected, the next in the highest  esteem; or this year in high repute, the next held at nothing. How  many changes has the blood of Childers undergone! once the best,  then the worst, now good again! Where are the descendants of Bay  Bolton, that once were the terror of their antagonists! Did these  prevail by the superiority of their blood, or because their power  and their fabric was superior to the Horses of their time? If any  one ask why Danby Cade was not as good a racer as any in the  kingdom, the jockey could not impute this defect to his blood; but  if it should be imputed to his want of proportion, surely it might  be held for a true and satisfactory reason. How many revolutions  of fame and credit, have all sportsmen observed in these HIGH-BRED  families.    Numberless are the examples of this kind which might be quoted,  but to account for this, one says, The blood is wore out for want  of a proper cross; another tells us, That after having been long  in this climate, the blood degenerates; but these reasons cannot  be true, because we see the off-spring of all crosses, and of the  most antient** families, occasionally triumphant over the sons of  the very latest comers, the error then will not be found in the  blood, or in the proper crossing; but the defect will be produced  by the erroneous judgment of mankind, in putting together the male  and female with improper shapes; and while we are lost and blinded  by an imaginary good, the laws of nature stand revealed; and we by  paying a proper attention thereto, and employing our judgment  therein, might wipe this ignis fatuus from the mind, and fix the  truth on a sure foundation. Our observation shews us, that on the  one hand, we may breed Horses of foreign extraction too delicate,  and too slight for any labour; and on the other hand, so coarse  and clumsy, as to be fitter for the cart than the race. Shall we  then wonder these cannot race, or shall we doubt that degrees of  imperfection in the mechanism, will produce degrees of  imperfection in racing! and when we find such deficient, shall we  ridiculously impute it to a degeneracy of that blood, which once  was in the highest esteem, or to the want of judgment in him who  did not properly adapt the shapes of their progenitors!    Shall we confess this, or is the fault in nature? For though most  philosophers agree, that innate principles do not exist, yet we  know for certain, that in the brute creation, whose food is plain  and simple, (unlike luxurious man) the laws of nature are,  generally speaking, invariable and determined. If it should be  asked why the sons of the Godolphin Arabian were superior to most  Horses of their time; I answer, because he had a great power and  symmetry of parts, (head excepted) and a propriety of length  greatly superior to all other Horses of the same diameter, that  have been lately seen in this kingdom; which I do not assert on my  own judgment, but on the opinion of those who, I believe,  understand Horses much better than I pretend to do: and 'tis very  probable, this Horse, if he had not been confined to particular  Mares, might have begot better racers than any he did. On the  contrary, I have heard it urged in behalf of his blood, that he  was a very mean Horse in figure, and that he was kept as a  teizer** some years before he covered. What does this prove? I  think nothing more, than that his first owner did not rightly  understand this kind of Horse, and that different men differed in  their opinions of this Horse's fabric.    If any man who doubts this excellence to be in the blood, should  ask how it came to pass that we often see two full brothers, one  of which is a good racer, the other indifferent, or perhaps bad, I  know of but two answers that can be given; we must either allow  this excellence of the blood to be partial, or else we must say,  that by putting together a Horse and a Mare, different in their  shapes, a foetus may be produced of a happy form at one time, and  at another the foetus partaking more or less of the shape of  either, may not be so happily formed. Which shall we do? shall we  impute this difference of goodness in the two brothers, to the  difference of their mechanism? or shall we say this perfection of  the blood is partial? If the latter, then we must own that blood  is not to be relied on, but that the system of it, and whatever is  built on that foundation, is precarious and uncertain, and  therefore falls to the ground of its own accord. Whilst this  continues to be the rule of breeding, I mean of putting male and  female together, with no consideration but that of blood and a  proper cross, it is no wonder so few good racers are produced, no  wonder mankind are disappointed in their pleasures and  expectations; for this prejudice does not only extend to blood,  but even to the very names of the breeders, and the country where  the Horses are bred, though it is beyond all doubt, that the North  claims the preference of all other places in this kingdom; but  that preference is allowed only from the multiplicity of Mares and  Stallions in those parts, and from the number of racers there  bred.    I would not be thought in this to prefer my own opinion of shape  and make to the known goodness of any Stallion, but would prefer  the latter before the opinion of all mankind. What then? It is not  every Horse that has been a good racer will get good colts; some  have suffered too much in their constitution by hard and"]]]
