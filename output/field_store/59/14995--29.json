I  had stayed at Brinkley Court quite a lot in my time, but I had no idea  the larder was such a social vortex. More like a snack bar on a  race-course than anything else, it seemed to have become.    \"Tell me the whole story in your own words,\" I said, \"omitting no detail,  however apparently slight, for one never knows how important the most  trivial detail may be.\"    He inspected the photograph for a moment with growing gloom.    \"All right,\" he said. \"This is what happened. You know my views about  that steak-and-kidney pie.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"Well, round about one a.m. I thought the time was ripe. I stole from my  room and went downstairs. The pie seemed to beckon me.\"    I nodded. I knew how pies do.    \"I got to the larder. I fished it out. I set it on the table. I found  knife and fork. I collected salt, mustard, and pepper. There were some  cold potatoes. I added those. And I was about to pitch in when I heard a  sound behind me, and there was your aunt at the door. In a blue-and-yellow  dressing gown.\"    \"Embarrassing.\"    \"Most.\"    \"I suppose you didn't know where to look.\"    \"I looked at Angela.\"    \"She came in with my aunt?\"    \"No. With your uncle, a minute or two later. He was wearing mauve pyjamas  and carried a pistol. Have you ever seen your uncle in pyjamas and a  pistol?\"    \"Never.\"    \"You haven't missed much.\"    \"Tell me, Tuppy,\" I asked, for I was anxious to ascertain this, \"about  Angela. Was there any momentary softening in her gaze as she fixed it on  you?\"    \"She didn't fix it on me. She fixed it on the pie.\"    \"Did she say anything?\"    \"Not right away. Your uncle was the first to speak. He said to your aunt,  'God bless my soul, Dahlia, what are you doing here?' To which she  replied, 'Well, if it comes to that, my merry somnambulist, what are  you?' Your uncle then said that he thought there must be burglars in the  house, as he had heard noises.\"    I nodded again. I could follow the trend. Ever since the scullery window  was found open the year Shining Light was disqualified in the Cesarewitch  for boring, Uncle Tom has had a marked complex about burglars. I can  still recall my emotions when, paying my first visit after he had bars  put on all the windows and attempting to thrust the head out in order to  get a sniff of country air, I nearly fractured my skull on a sort of iron  grille, as worn by the tougher kinds of mediaeval prison.    \"'What sort of noises?' said your aunt. 'Funny noises,' said your uncle.  Whereupon Angela--with a nasty, steely tinkle in her voice, the little  buzzard--observed, 'I expect it was Mr. Glossop eating.' And then she did  give me a look. It was the sort of wondering, revolted look a very  spiritual woman would give a fat man gulping soup in a restaurant. The  kind of look that makes a fellow feel he's forty-six round the waist and  has great rolls of superfluous flesh pouring down over the back of his  collar. And, still speaking in the same unpleasant tone, she added, 'I  ought to have told you, father, that Mr. Glossop always likes to have a  good meal three or four times during the night. It helps to keep him  going till breakfast. He has the most amazing appetite. See, he has  practically finished a large steak-and-kidney pie already'.\"    As he spoke these words, a feverish animation swept over Tuppy. His eyes  glittered with a strange light, and he thumped the bed violently with his  fist, nearly catching me a juicy one on the leg.    \"That was what hurt, Bertie. That was what stung. I hadn't so much as  started on that pie. But that's a woman all over.\"    \"The eternal feminine.\"    \"She continued her remarks. 'You've no idea,' she said, 'how Mr. Glossop  loves food. He just lives for it. He always eats six or seven meals a  day, and then starts in again after bedtime. I think it's rather  wonderful.' Your aunt seemed interested, and said it reminded her of a  boa constrictor. Angela said, didn't she mean a python? And then they  argued as to which of the two it was. Your uncle, meanwhile, poking about  with that damned pistol of his till human life wasn't safe in the  vicinity. And the pie lying there on the table, and me unable to touch  it. You begin to understand why I said I had been through hell.\"    \"Quite. Can't have been at all pleasant.\"    \"Presently your aunt and Angela settled their discussion, deciding that  Angela was right and that it was a python that I reminded them of. And  shortly after that we all pushed back to bed, Angela warning me in a  motherly voice not to take the stairs too quickly. After seven or eight  solid meals, she said, a man of my build ought to be very careful,  because of the danger of apoplectic fits. She said it was the same with  dogs. When they became very fat and overfed, you had to see that they  didn't hurry upstairs, as it made them puff and pant, and that was bad  for their hearts. She asked your aunt if she remembered the late spaniel,  Ambrose; and your aunt said, 'Poor old Ambrose, you couldn't keep him  away from the garbage pail'; and Angela said, 'Exactly, so do please be  careful, Mr. Glossop.' And you tell me she loves me still!\"    I did my best to encourage.    \"Girlish banter, what?\"    \"Girlish banter be dashed. She's right off me. Once her ideal, I am now  less than the dust beneath her chariot wheels. She became infatuated with  this chap, whoever he was, at Cannes, and now she can't stand the sight  of me.\"    I raised my eyebrows.    \"My dear Tuppy, you are not showing your usual good sense in this  Angela-chap-at-Cannes matter. If you will forgive me saying so, you have  got an _idee fixe_.\"    \"A what?\"    \"An _idee fixe_. You know. One of those things fellows get. Like Uncle  Tom's delusion that everybody who is known even slightly to the police is  lurking in the garden, waiting for a chance to break into the house. You  keep talking about this chap at Cannes, and there never was a chap at  Cannes, and I'll tell you why I'm so sure about this. During those two  months on the Riviera, it so happens that Angela and I were practically  inseparable. If there had been somebody nosing round her, I should have  spotted it in a second.\"    He started. I could see that this had impressed him.    \"Oh, she was with you all the time at Cannes, was she?\"    \"I don't suppose she said two words to anybody else, except, of course,  idle conv. at the crowded dinner table or a chance remark in a throng at  the Casino.\"    \"I see. You mean that anything in the shape of mixed bathing and  moonlight strolls she conducted solely in your company?\"    \"That's right. It was quite a joke in the hotel.\"    \"You must have enjoyed that.\"    \"Oh, rather. I've always been devoted to Angela.\"    \"Oh, yes?\"    \"When we were kids, she used to call herself my little sweetheart.\"    \"She did?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    \"I see.\"    He sat plunged in thought, while I, glad to have set his mind at rest,  proceeded with my tea. And presently there came the banging of a gong  from the hall below, and he started like a war horse at the sound of the  bugle.    \"Breakfast!\" he said, and was off to a flying start, leaving me to brood  and ponder. And the more I brooded and pondered, the more did it seem to  me that everything now looked pretty smooth. Tuppy, I could see, despite  that painful scene in the larder, still loved Angela with all the old  fervour.    This meant that I could rely on that plan to which I had referred to  bring home the bacon. And as I had found the way to straighten out the  Gussie-Bassett difficulty, there seemed nothing more to worry about.    It was with an uplifted heart that I addressed Jeeves as he came in to  remove the tea tray.        -13-      \"Jeeves,\" I said.    \"Sir?\"    \"I've just been having a chat with young Tuppy, Jeeves. Did you  happen to notice that he wasn't looking very roguish this morning?\"    \"Yes, sir. It seemed to me that Mr. Glossop's face was sicklied o'er with  the pale cast of thought.\"    \"Quite. He met my cousin Angela in the larder last night, and a rather  painful interview ensued.\"    \"I am sorry, sir.\"    \"Not half so sorry as he was. She found him closeted with a  steak-and-kidney pie, and appears to have been a bit caustic about fat  men who lived for food alone.\"    \"Most disturbing, sir.\"    \"Very. In fact, many people would say that things had gone so far between  these two nothing now could bridge the chasm. A girl who could make  cracks about human pythons who ate nine or ten meals a day and ought to  be careful not to hurry upstairs because of the danger of apoplectic fits  is a girl, many people would say, in whose heart love is dead. Wouldn't  people say that, Jeeves?\"    \"Undeniably, sir.\"    \"They would be wrong.\"    \"You think so, sir?\"    \"I am convinced of it. I know these females. You can't go by what they  say.\"    \"You feel that Miss Angela's strictures should not be taken too much  _au pied de la lettre_, sir?\"    \"Eh?\"    \"In English, we should say 'literally'.\"    \"Literally. That's exactly what I mean. You know what girls are. A tiff  occurs, and they shoot their heads off. But underneath it all the old  love still remains. Am I correct?\"    \"Quite correct, sir. The poet Scott----\"    \"Right ho, Jeeves.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"And in order to bring that old love whizzing to the surface once more,  all that is required is the proper treatment.\"    \"By 'proper treatment,' sir, you mean----\"    \"Clever handling, Jeeves. A spot of the good old snaky work. I see what  must be done to jerk my Cousin Angela back to normalcy. I'll tell you,  shall I?\"    \"If you would be so kind, sir.\"    I lit a cigarette, and eyed him keenly through the smoke. He waited  respectfully for me to unleash the words of wisdom. I must say for Jeeves  that--till, as he is so apt to do, he starts shoving his oar in and  cavilling and obstructing--he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#20)"],[1,"suggested, and listened at her ladyship's door. However, all  was quiet in the room, and, thinking her ladyship had gone to sleep, I  went back to bed.    \"'The next morning at eight o'clock, when I took in my mistress's cup of  tea, I saw her lying on the floor, her poor dear face all purple and  distorted. I screamed, and the other servants came rushing along. Then  Mr. Graham had the door locked and sent for the doctor and the police.'    \"The poor woman seemed to find it very difficult not to break down. She  was closely questioned by Sir James Fenwick, but had nothing further to  say. She had last seen her mistress alive at eight o'clock on the  evening of the 24th.    \"'And when you listened at her door at ten o'clock,' asked Sir James,  'did you try to open it?'    \"'I did, but it was locked,' she replied.    \"'Did Lady Donaldson usually lock her bedroom at night?'    \"'Nearly always.'    \"'And in the morning when you took in the tea?'    \"'The door was open. I walked straight in.'    \"'You are quite sure?' insisted Sir James.    \"'I swear it,' solemnly asserted the woman.    \"After that we were informed by several members of Mr. Graham's  establishment that Miss Crawford had been in to tea at Charlotte Square  in the afternoon of the 24th, that she told every one she was going to  London by the night mail, as she had some special shopping she wished to  do there. It appears that Mr. Graham and David both tried to persuade  her to stay to dinner, and then to go by the 9.10 p.m. from the  Caledonian Station. Miss Crawford however had refused, saying she always  preferred to go from the Waverley Station. It was nearer to her own  rooms, and she still had a good deal of writing to do.    \"In spite of this, two witnesses saw the accused in Charlotte Square  later on in the evening. She was carrying a bag which seemed heavy, and  was walking towards the Caledonian Railway Station.    \"But the most thrilling moment in that sensational trial was reached on  the second day, when David Graham, looking wretchedly ill, unkempt, and  haggard, stepped into the witness-box. A murmur of sympathy went round  the audience at sight of him, who was the second, perhaps, most deeply  stricken victim of the Charlotte Square tragedy.    \"David Graham, in answer to Crown Counsel, gave an account of his last  interview with Lady Donaldson.    \"'Tremlett had told me that she seemed anxious and upset, and I went to  have a chat with her; she soon cheered up and....'    \"There the unfortunate young man hesitated visibly, but after a while  resumed with an obvious effort.    \"'She spoke of my marriage, and of the gift she was about to bestow upon  me. She said the diamonds would be for my wife, and after that for my  daughter, if I had one. She also complained that Mr. Macfinlay had been  so punctilious about preparing the deed of gift, and that it was a great  pity the L100,000 could not just pass from her hands to mine without so  much fuss.    \"'I stayed talking with her for about half an hour; then I left her, as  she seemed ready to go to bed; but I told her maid to listen at the door  in about an hour's time.'    \"There was deep silence in the court for a few moments, a silence which  to me seemed almost electrical. It was as if, some time before it was  uttered, the next question put by Crown Counsel to the witness had  hovered in the air.    \"'You were engaged to Miss Edith Crawford at one time, were you not?'    \"One felt, rather than heard, the almost inaudible 'Yes' which escaped  from David Graham's compressed lips.    \"'Under what circumstances was that engagement broken off?'    \"Sir James Fenwick had already risen in protest, but David Graham had  been the first to speak.    \"'I do not think that I need answer that question.'    \"'I will put it in a different form, then,' said Crown Counsel  urbanely--'one to which my learned friend cannot possibly take  exception. Did you or did you not on October 27th receive a letter from  the accused, in which she desired to be released from her promise of  marriage to you?'    \"Again David Graham would have refused to answer, and he certainly gave  no audible reply to the learned counsel's question; but every one in the  audience there present--aye, every member of the jury and of the  bar--read upon David Graham's pale countenance and large, sorrowful eyes  that ominous 'Yes!' which had failed to reach his trembling lips.\"          CHAPTER XVI    \"NON PROVEN\"      \"There is no doubt,\" continued the man in the corner, \"that what little  sympathy the young girl's terrible position had aroused in the public  mind had died out the moment that David Graham left the witness-box on  the second day of the trial. Whether Edith Crawford was guilty of murder  or not, the callous way in which she had accepted a deformed lover, and  then thrown him over, had set every one's mind against her.    \"It was Mr. Graham himself who had been the first to put the Procurator  Fiscal in possession of the fact that the accused had written to David  from London, breaking off her engagement. This information had, no  doubt, directed the attention of the Fiscal to Miss Crawford, and the  police soon brought forward the evidence which had led to her arrest.    \"We had a final sensation on the third day, when Mr. Campbell, jeweller,  of High Street, gave his evidence. He said that on October 25th a lady  came to his shop and offered to sell him a pair of diamond earrings.  Trade had been very bad, and he had refused the bargain, although the  lady seemed ready to part with the earrings for an extraordinarily low  sum, considering the beauty of the stones.    \"In fact it was because of this evident desire on the lady's part to  sell at _any_ cost that he had looked at her more keenly than he  otherwise would have done. He was now ready to swear that the lady that  offered him the diamond earrings was the prisoner in the dock.    \"I can assure you that as we all listened to this apparently damnatory  evidence, you might have heard a pin drop amongst the audience in that  crowded court. The girl alone, there in the dock, remained calm and  unmoved. Remember that for two days we had heard evidence to prove that  old Dr. Crawford had died leaving his daughter penniless, that having no  mother she had been brought up by a maiden aunt, who had trained her to  be a governess, which occupation she had followed for years, and that  certainly she had never been known by any of her friends to be in  possession of solitaire diamond earrings.    \"The prosecution had certainly secured an ace of trumps, but Sir James  Fenwick, who during the whole of that day had seemed to take little  interest in the proceedings, here rose from his seat, and I knew at once  that he had got a tit-bit in the way of a 'point' up his sleeve. Gaunt,  and unusually tall, and with his beak-like nose, he always looks  strangely impressive when he seriously tackles a witness. He did it this  time with a vengeance, I can tell you. He was all over the pompous  little jeweller in a moment.    \"'Had Mr. Campbell made a special entry in his book, as to the visit of  the lady in question?'    \"'No.'    \"'Had he any special means of ascertaining when that visit did actually  take place?'    \"'No--but--'    \"'What record had he of the visit?'    \"Mr. Campbell had none. In fact, after about twenty minutes of  cross-examination, he had to admit that he had given but little thought  to the interview with the lady at the time, and certainly not in  connection with the murder of Lady Donaldson, until he had read in the  papers that a young lady had been arrested.    \"Then he and his clerk talked the matter over, it appears, and together  they had certainly recollected that a lady had brought some beautiful  earrings for sale on a day which _must have been_ the very morning after  the murder. If Sir James Fenwick's object was to discredit this special  witness, he certainly gained his point.    \"All the pomposity went out of Mr. Campbell, he became flurried, then  excited, then he lost his temper. After that he was allowed to leave the  court, and Sir James Fenwick resumed his seat, and waited like a  vulture for its prey.    \"It presented itself in the person of Mr. Campbell's clerk, who, before  the Procurator Fiscal, had corroborated his employer's evidence in every  respect. In Scotland no witness in any one case is present in court  during the examination of another, and Mr. Macfarlane, the clerk, was,  therefore, quite unprepared for the pitfalls which Sir James Fenwick had  prepared for him. He tumbled into them, head foremost, and the eminent  advocate turned him inside out like a glove.    \"Mr. Macfarlane did not lose his temper; he was of too humble a frame of  mind to do that, but he got into a hopeless quagmire of mixed  recollections, and he too left the witness-box quite unprepared to swear  as to the day of the interview with the lady with the diamond earrings.    \"I dare say, mind you,\" continued the man in the corner with a chuckle,  \"that to most people present, Sir James Fenwick's cross-questioning  seemed completely irrelevant. Both Mr. Campbell and his clerk were quite  ready to swear that they had had an interview concerning some diamond  earrings with a lady, of whose identity with the accused they were  perfectly convinced, and to the casual observer the question as to the  time or even the day when that interview took place could make but  little difference in the ultimate issue.    \"Now I took in, in a moment, the entire drift of Sir James Fenwick's  defence of Edith Crawford. When Mr. Macfarlane left the witness-box, the  second victim of the eminent advocate's caustic tongue, I could read as  in a book the whole history of that crime, its investigation, and the  mistakes made by the police first and the Public Prosecutor afterwards.    \"Sir James Fenwick knew them, too, of course, and he placed a finger  upon each one,"]]]
