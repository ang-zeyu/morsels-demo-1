Usually, but one of the animals in the stable or herd is  affected. If several are affected, it is because all have been subject to  the same condition, and not because the disease has spread from one animal  to another.    _Specific Diseases._--The terms infectious and contagious are used in  speaking of specific diseases. Much confusion exists in the popular use of  these terms. A _contagious_ disease is one that may be transmitted by  personal contact, as, for example, influenza, glanders and hog-cholera. As  these diseases may be produced by indirect contact with the diseased animal  as well as by direct, they are also _infectious_. There are a few germ  diseases that are not spread by the healthy animals coming in direct  contact with the diseased animal, as, for example, black leg and southern  cattle fever. These are purely infectious diseases. Infection is a more  comprehensive term than contagion, as it may be used in alluding to all  germ diseases, while the use of the term contagion is rightly limited to  such diseases as are produced principally through individual contact.    _Parasitic diseases_ are very common among domestic animals. This class of  disease is caused by insects and worms, as for example, lice, mites, ticks,  flies, and round and flat worms that live at the expense of their hosts.  They may invade any of the organs of the body, but most commonly inhabit  the digestive tract and skin. Some of the parasitic insects, mosquitoes,  flies and ticks, act as secondary hosts for certain animal microorganisms  that they transmit to healthy individuals through the punctures or the  bites that they are capable of producing in the skin.    CAUSES.--For convenience we may divide the causes of disease into the  predisposing or indirect, and the exciting or direct.    _The predisposing causes_ are such factors as tend to render the body more  susceptible to disease or favor the presence of the exciting cause. For  example, an animal that is narrow chested and lacking in the development of  the vital organs lodged in the thoracic cavity, when exposed to the same  condition as the other members of the herd, may contract disease while the  animals having better conformation do not (Fig. 1). Hogs confined in  well-drained yards and pastures that are free from filth, and fed in pens  and on feeding floors that are clean, do not become hosts for large numbers  of parasites. Hogs confined in filthy pens are frequently so badly infested  with lice and intestinal worms that their health and thriftiness are  seriously interfered with. In the first case mentioned the predisposition  to disease is in the individual, and in the second case it is in the  surroundings (Fig. 2).    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Side and posterior view of bull showing  conformation favorable to the development of disease.]    _The exciting causes_ are the immediate causes of the particular disease.  Exciting causes usually operate through the environment. With the exception  of the special disease-producing germs, the most common exciting causes are  faulty food and faulty methods of feeding. The following predisposing  causes of disease may be mentioned:    _Age_ is an important factor in the production of disease. Young and  immature animals are more prone to attacks of infectious diseases than are  old and mature animals. Hog-cholera usually affects the young hogs in the  herd first, while scours, suppurative joint disease and infectious sore  mouth are diseases that occur during the first few days or few weeks of the  animal's life. Lung and intestinal parasites are more commonly found in the  young, growing animals. Old animals are prone to fractures of bones and  degenerative changes of the body tissues. As a general rule, the young are  more subject to acute diseases and the old to chronic diseases.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Insanitary yards.]    _The surroundings or environments_ are important predisposing factors. A  dark, crowded, poorly ventilated stable lowers the animal's vitality, and  renders it more susceptible to the disease. A few rods difference in the  location of stables and yards may make a marked difference in the health of  the herd. A dry, protected site is always preferable to one in the open or  on low, poorly drained soil. The majority of domestic animals need but  little shelter, but they do need dry, comfortable quarters during wet, cold  weather.    _Faulty feed and faulty methods of feeding_ are very common causes of  diseases of the digestive tract and the nervous system. A change from dry  feed to a green, succulent ration is a common cause of acute indigestion in  both horses and cattle. The feeding of a heavy ration of grain to horses  that are accustomed to exercise, during enforced rest may cause liver and  kidney disorders. The feeding of spoiled, decomposed feeds may cause  serious nervous and intestinal disorders.    _One attack of a certain disease_ may influence the development of  subsequent attacks of the same, or a different disease. An individual may  suffer from an attack of pneumonia that so weakens the disease-resisting  powers of the lungs as to result in a tubercular infection of these organs.  In the horse, one attack of azoturia predisposes it to a second attack. One  attack of an infectious disease usually confers immunity against that  particular disease. _Heredity_ does not play as important a part in the  development of diseases in domestic animals as in the human race. A certain  family may inherit a predisposition to disease through the faulty or  insufficient development of an organ or group of organs. The different  species of animals are affected by diseases peculiar to that particular  species. The horse is the only species that is affected with azoturia.  Glanders affects solipeds, while black leg is a disease peculiar to cattle.      QUESTIONS    1. What is disease?    2. How are diseases classified? Give an example of the different classes.    3.

CHAPTER II    DIAGNOSIS AND SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE      The importance of recognizing or diagnosing the seat and nature of the  morbid change occurring in an organ or group of organs cannot be  overestimated. Laymen do not comprehend the difficulty or importance of  correctly grouping the signs or symptoms of disease in such a way as to  enable them to recognize the nature of the disease. In order to be able to  understand the meaning of the many symptoms or signs of disease, we must  possess knowledge of the structure and physiological functions of the  different organs of the body. We must be familiar with the animal when it  is in good health in order to be able to recognize any deviation from the  normal due to disease, and we must learn from personal observation the  different symptoms that characterize the different diseases. Stockmen  should be able to tell when any of the animals in their care are sick as  soon as the first symptom of disease manifests itself, by changes in the  general appearance and behavior. But in order to ascertain the exact  condition a general and systematic examination is necessary. The examiner,  whether he be a layman or a veterinarian, must observe the animal  carefully, noting the behavior, appearance, surroundings, and general and  local symptoms.    Before making a _general examination_ of the animal it is well, if the  examiner is not already acquainted with the history of the case (care, feed  and surroundings), to learn as much about this from the attendant as is  possible. Inquiry should be made as to the feeding, the conditions under  which the animal has been kept, the length of time it has been sick, its  actions, or any other information that may be of assistance in forming the  diagnosis and outlining the treatment.    The _general symptoms_ inform us regarding the condition of the different  groups of body organs. A careful study of this group of symptoms enables us  correctly to diagnose disease and inform ourselves as to the progress of  long, severe affections. These symptoms occur in connection with the pulse,  respirations, body temperature, skin and coat, visible mucous membranes,  secretions and excretions, and behavior of the animal.    _The local symptoms_ are confined to a definite part or organ. Swelling,  pain, tenderness and loss of function are common local symptoms. A _direct_  symptom may also be considered under this head because of its direct  relation to the seat of disease. It aids greatly in forming the diagnosis.    Other terms used in describing symptoms of disease are _objective_, which  includes all that can be recognized by the person making the examination;  _indirect_, which are observed at a distance from the seat of the disease;  and _premonitory_, which precede the direct, or characteristic symptoms.  The _subjective_ symptoms include such as are felt and described by the  patient. These symptoms are available from the human patient only.    Pulse.--The character of the intermittent expansion of the arteries, called  the pulse, informs us as to the condition of the heart and blood-vessels.  The frequency of the pulse beat varies in the different species of animals.  The smaller the animal the more frequent the pulse. In young animals the  number of beats per minute is greater than in adults. Excitement or fear,  especially if the animal possesses a nervous temperament, increases the  frequency of the pulse. During, and for a short time after, feeding and  exercise, the pulse rate is higher than when the animal is standing at  rest.    The following table gives the normal rate of the pulse beats per minute:    Horse  36 to  40 per minute  Ox     45 to  50 per minute  Sheep  70 to  80 per minute  Pig    70 to  80 per minute  Dog    90 to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8508"],[0,"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved in 50 Arguments (#2)"],[1,"  for all, before it has led multitudes more astray, and wrecked the  faith and hopes of the young.    Prof. H. H. Newman, in his \"Readings in Evolution,\" p. 57, says,  \"Reluctant as we may be to admit it, honesty compels the evolutionist  to admit that there is no absolute proof of organic evolution.\" \"If  all the facts are in accord with it, and none are found that are  incapable of being reconciled with it, a working hypothesis is said to  have been advanced to a proven theory.\" Note this admission by a  leading evolutionist.    Even if it should ever be proved that all plant and animal life came  by evolution from one primordial germ, it would not follow that either  the body or the soul of man came by evolution. All the arguments  against evolution in general are valid against the evolution of man.  In addition, there are many other arguments, that prove the evolution  of man impossible, even if the evolution of plants and animals should  ever be proved possible.    In this volume, the claim is made that the evolution of man is  irreconcilable with a large number of facts. If investigation proves  that we have erred in any statement of facts, or if our reasoning in  any one argument or more is fallacious, we will not lose our case, as  long as evolution remains irreconcilable with any other single  fact. If every argument in this book were invalid, save one, that one  valid argument would overthrow evolution, since every true theory must  be reconcilable with all the facts. One irreconcilable fact is  sufficient to overthrow evolution. And there are many!      THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN RACE    The evolution of man is not only a guess, but a very wild one; and it  is totally unsupported by any convincing arguments. It can be  mathematically demonstrated to be an impossible theory. Every proof of  the unity of the human race in the days of Adam or Noah shatters the  theory of the evolution of man. If the evolution of the human race be  true, there must have been, hundreds of thousands of years ago, a  great multitude of heads of the race, in many parts of the earth,  without one common language or religion. The present population of the  globe proves that mankind must have descended from one pair who lived  not earlier than the time of Noah. The unity of languages also proves  one common head about the same time. Certain beliefs and customs,  common to various religions, point to one original God-given religion  in historic time, in contrast to the evolution idea of many religions  invented by ape-men in millions of years. The history of the world and  the migration of nations point to one locality where the human race  began in times not more remote, and show that man was created in a  civilized state, and, therefore, never was a brute. If evolution were  true, there would have been many billion times as many human beings as  now exist, a great multitude of invented languages with little or no  similarity, a vast number of invented religions with little, if  anything, in common. Even the sciences invented and exploited by  evolutionists, the Mendelian Inheritance Law and Biometry, also prove  evolution impossible.    The unity of mankind is also conclusively shown by the fact that all  races interbreed, the most certain test of every species.    All these facts pointing to the unity of the race in the days of Noah  and of Adam are irreconcilable with the theory of evolution which  denies that unity within the last two million years.    We shall present these arguments more in detail. The arguments  immediately following, especially the first eight, show the unity of  the human race in the days of Noah, and thus present insuperable  objections to evolution, and confirm the story of man's creation and  his destruction by the flood. The following is the first of fifty  Arguments against the evolution of man.        1. THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD      The population of the world, based upon the Berlin census reports of  1922, was found to be 1,804,187,000.  The human race must double  itself 30.75 times to make this number. This result may be  approximately ascertained by the following computation:--    At the beginning of the first period of doubling there would just be  two human beings; the second, 4; the third, 8; the fourth, 16; the  tenth, 1024; the twentieth, 1,048,576, the thirtieth, 1,073,741,824;  and the thirty-first, 2,147,483,648. In other words, if we raise two  to the thirtieth power, we have 1,073,741,824; or to the thirty-first  power, 2,147,483,648. Therefore, it is evident even to the school boy,  that, to have the present population of the globe, the net population  must be doubled more than thirty times and less than thirty-one  times. By logarithms, we find it to be 30.75 times. After all  allowances are made for natural deaths, wars, catastrophes, and losses  of all kinds, if the human race would double its numbers 30.75 times,  we would have the present population of the globe.    Now, according to the chronology of Hales, based on the Septuagint  text, 5077 years have elapsed since the flood, and 5177 years since  the ancestors of mankind numbered only two, Noah and his wife. By  dividing 5177 by 30.75, we find it requires an average of 168.3 years  for the human race to double its numbers, in order to make the present  population. This is a reasonable average length of time.    Moreover, it is singularly confirmed by the number of Jews, or  descendants of Jacob. According to Hales, 3850 years have passed since  the marriage of Jacob. By the same method of calculation as above, the  Jews, who, according to the Jewish yearbook for 1922, number  15,393,815, must have doubled their numbers 23.8758 times, or once  every 161.251 years. The whole human race, therefore, on an average  has doubled its numbers every 168.3 years; and the Jews, every 161.251  years. What a marvelous agreement! We would not expect the figures to  be exactly the same nor be greatly surprised if one period were twice  the other. But their correspondence singularly corroborates the age of  the human race and of the Jewish people, as gleaned from the word of  God by the most proficient chronologists. If the human race is  2,000,000 years old, the period of doubling would be 65,040 years, or  402 times that of the Jews, which, of course, is unthinkable.    While the period of doubling may vary slightly in different ages, yet  there are few things so stable and certain as general average, where  large numbers and many years are considered, as in the present  case. No life insurance company, acting on general average statistics,  ever failed on that account. The Jews and the whole human race have  lived together the same thirty-eight centuries with very little  intermarriage, and are affected by similar advantages and  disadvantages, making the comparison remarkably fair.    Also, the 25,000,000 descendants of Abraham must have doubled their  numbers every 162.275 years, during the 3,988 years since the birth of  his son Ishmael. These periods of doubling which tally so closely,  168.3 years for the whole race, 161.251 for the Jews, and 162.275  years for the descendants of Abraham, cannot be a mere coincidence,  but are a demonstration against the great age of man required by  evolution, and in favor of the 5,177 years since Noah. None of the  other various chronologies would make any material difference in these  calculations.  The correspondence of these figures, 168.3, 161.251 and  162.275 is so remarkable that it must bring the conviction to every  serious student that the flood destroyed mankind and Noah became the  head of the race.    Now the evolutionists claim that the human race is 2,000,000 years  old. There is no good reason for believing that, during all these  years the developing dominant species would not increase as rapidly as  the Jews, or the human race in historic times, especially since the  restraints of civilization and marriage did not exist. But let us  generously suppose that these remote ancestors, beginning with one  pair, doubled their numbers in 1612.51 years, one-tenth as rapidly as  the Jews, or 1240 times in 2,000,000 years. If we raise 2 to the  1240th power, the result is 18,932,139,737,991 with 360 figures  following. The population of the world, therefore, would have been  18,932,139,737,991 decillion, decillion, decillion, decillion,  decillion, decillion, decillion, decillion, decillion, decillion; or  18,932,139,737,991 vigintillion, vigintillion, vigintillion,  vigintillion, vigintillion, vigintillion.    Or, let us suppose that man, the dominant species, originated from a  single pair, only 100,000 years ago, the shortest period suggested by  any evolutionist (and much too short for evolution) and that the  population doubled in 1612.51 years, one-tenth the Jewish rate of net  increase, a most generous estimate. The present population of the  globe should be 4,660,210,253,138,204,300 or 2,527,570,733 for every  man, woman and child! In these calculations, we have made greater  allowances than any self-respecting evolutionist could ask without  blushing. And yet withal, it is as clear as the light of day that the  ancestors of man could not possibly have lived 2,000,000 or 1,000,000  or 100,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago; for if the population  had increased at the Jewish rate for 10,000 years, it would be more  than two billion times as great as it is. No guess that ever was made,  or ever can be made, much in excess of 5177 years, can possibly stand  as the age of man. The evolutionist cannot sidestep this argument by a  new guess. Q. E. D.    All these computations have been made upon the supposition that the  human race sprang from one pair. If from many in the distant past, as  the evolutionists assert, these bewildering figures must be enormously  increased.    Yet we are gravely told that evolution is \"science\". It is the wildest  guess ever made to support an"]]]
