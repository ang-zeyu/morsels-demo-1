[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8578"],[0,"The Grand Inquisitor (#2)"],[1,"  child of an eminent citizen of the city. The little corpse lies  buried in flowers. 'He will raise the child to life!' confidently  shouts the crowd to the weeping mother. The officiating priest  who had come to meet the funeral procession, looks perplexed, and  frowns. A loud cry is suddenly heard, and the bereaved mother  prostrates herself at His feet. 'If it be Thou, then bring back  my child to life!' she cries beseechingly. The procession halts,  and the little coffin is gently lowered at his feet. Divine  compassion beams forth from His eyes, and as He looks at the  child, His lips are heard to whisper once more, 'Talitha  Cumi'--and 'straightway the damsel arose.' The child rises in her  coffin. Her little hands still hold the nosegay of white roses  which after death was placed in them, and, looking round with  large astonished eyes she smiles sweetly .... The crowd is  violently excited. A terrible commotion rages among them, the  populace shouts and loudly weeps, when suddenly, before the  cathedral door, appears the Cardinal Grand Inquisitor himself....  He is tall, gaunt-looking old man of nearly four-score years and  ten, with a stern, withered face, and deeply sunken eyes, from  the cavity of which glitter two fiery sparks. He has laid aside  his gorgeous cardinal's robes in which he had appeared before the  people at the auto da-fe of the enemies of the Romish Church, and  is now clad in his old, rough, monkish cassock. His sullen  assistants and slaves of the 'holy guard' are following at a  distance. He pauses before the crowd and observes. He has seen  all. He has witnessed the placing of the little coffin at His  feet, the calling back to life. And now, his dark, grim face has  grown still darker; his bushy grey eyebrows nearly meet, and his  sunken eye flashes with sinister light. Slowly raising his  finger, he commands his minions to arrest Him....    \"Such is his power over the well-disciplined, submissive and now  trembling people, that the thick crowds immediately give way, and  scattering before the guard, amid dead silence and without one  breath of protest, allow them to lay their sacrilegious hands  upon the stranger and lead Him away.... That same populace, like  one man, now bows its head to the ground before the old  Inquisitor, who blesses it and slowly moves onward. The guards  conduct their prisoner to the ancient building of the Holy  Tribunal; pushing Him into a narrow, gloomy, vaulted prison-cell,  they lock Him in and retire....    \"The day wanes, and night--a dark, hot breathless Spanish  night--creeps on and settles upon the city of Seville. The air smells  of laurels and orange blossoms. In the Cimmerian darkness of the  old Tribunal Hall the iron door of the cell is suddenly thrown  open, and the Grand Inquisitor, holding a dark lantern, slowly  stalks into the dungeon. He is alone, and, as the heavy door  closes behind him, he pauses at the threshold, and, for a minute  or two, silently and gloomily scrutinizes the Face before him. At  last approaching with measured steps, he sets his lantern down  upon the table and addresses Him in these words:    \"'It is Thou! ... Thou!' ... Receiving no reply, he rapidly  continues: 'Nay, answer not; be silent! ... And what couldst Thou  say? ... I know but too well Thy answer.... Besides, Thou hast no  right to add one syllable to that which was already uttered by  Thee before.... Why shouldst Thou now return, to impede us in our  work? For Thou hast come but for that only, and Thou knowest it  well. But art Thou as well aware of what awaits Thee in the  morning? I do not know, nor do I care to know who thou mayest be:  be it Thou or only thine image, to-morrow I will condemn and burn  Thee on the stake, as the most wicked of all the heretics; and  that same people, who to-day were kissing Thy feet, to-morrow at  one bend of my finger, will rush to add fuel to Thy funeral  pile... Wert Thou aware of this?' he adds, speaking as if in  solemn thought, and never for one instant taking his piercing  glance off the meek Face before him.\"....    \"I can hardly realize the situation described--what is all  this, Ivan?\" suddenly interrupted Alyosha, who had remained  silently listening to his brother. \"Is this an extravagant fancy,  or some mistake of the old man, an impossible quid pro quo?\"    \"Let it be the latter, if you like,\" laughed Ivan, \"since modern  realism has so perverted your taste that you feel unable to  realize anything from the world of fancy.... Let it be a quid pro  quo, if you so choose it. Again, the Inquisitor is ninety years  old, and he might have easily gone mad with his one idee fixe of  power; or, it might have as well been a delirious vision, called  forth by dying fancy, overheated by the auto-da-fe of the hundred  heretics in that forenoon.... But what matters for the poem,  whether it was a quid pro quo or an uncontrollable fancy? The  question is, that the old man has to open his heart; that he must  give out his thought at last; and that the hour has come when he  does speak it out, and says loudly that which for ninety years he  has kept secret within his own breast.\"    \"And his prisoner, does He never reply? Does He keep silent,  looking at him, without saying a word?\"    \"Of course; and it could not well be otherwise,\" again retorted  Ivan. \"The Grand Inquisitor begins from his very first words by  telling Him that He has no right to add one syllable to that which  He had said before. To make the situation clear at once, the above  preliminary monologue is intended to convey to the reader the very  fundamental idea which underlies Roman Catholicism--as well as I  can convey it, his words mean, in short: 'Everything was given  over by Thee to the Pope, and everything now rests with him alone;  Thou hast no business to return and thus hinder us in our work.'  In this sense the Jesuits not only talk but write likewise.    \"'Hast thou the right to divulge to us a single one of the  mysteries of that world whence Thou comest?' enquires of Him my  old Inquisitor, and forthwith answers for Him. 'Nay, Thou has no  such right. For, that would be adding to that which was already  said by Thee before; hence depriving people of that freedom for  which Thou hast so stoutly stood up while yet on earth....  Anything new that Thou would now proclaim would have to be  regarded as an attempt to interfere with that freedom of choice,  as it would come as a new and a miraculous revelation superseding  the old revelation of fifteen hundred years ago, when Thou didst  so repeatedly tell the people: \"The truth shall make you free.\"  Behold then, Thy \"free\" people now!' adds the old man with sombre  irony. 'Yea!... it has cost us dearly.' he continues, sternly  looking at his victim. 'But we have at last accomplished our  task, and--in Thy name.... For fifteen long centuries we had to  toil and suffer owing to that \"freedom\": but now we have  prevailed and our work is done, and well and strongly it is done.  ....Believest not Thou it is so very strong? ... And why should  Thou look at me so meekly as if I were not worthy even of Thy  indignation?... Know then, that now, and only now, Thy people  feel fully sure and satisfied of their freedom; and that only  since they have themselves and of their own free will delivered  that freedom unto our hands by placing it submissively at our  feet. But then, that is what we have done. Is it that which Thou  has striven for? Is this the kind of \"freedom\" Thou has promised  them?'\"    \"Now again, I do not understand,\" interrupted Alyosha. \"Does the  old man mock and laugh?\"    \"Not in the least. He seriously regards it as a great service  done by himself, his brother monks and Jesuits, to humanity, to  have conquered and subjected unto their authority that freedom,  and boasts that it was done but for the good of the world. 'For  only now,' he says (speaking of the Inquisition) 'has it become  possible to us, for the first time, to give a serious thought to  human happiness. Man is born a rebel, and can rebels be ever  happy?... Thou has been fairly warned of it, but evidently to no  use, since Thou hast rejected the only means which could make  mankind happy; fortunately at Thy departure Thou hast delivered  the task to us.... Thou has promised, ratifying the pledge by Thy  own words, in words giving us the right to bind and unbind... and  surely, Thou couldst not think of depriving us of it now!'\"    \"But what can he mean by the words, 'Thou has been fairly  warned'?\" asked Alexis.    \"These words give the key to what the old man has to say for his  justification... But listen--    \"'The terrible and wise spirit, the spirit of self annihilation  and non-being,' goes on the Inquisitor, 'the great spirit of  negation conversed with Thee in the wilderness, and we are told  that he \"tempted\" Thee... Was it so? And if it were so, then it is  impossible to utter anything more truthful than what is contained  in his three offers, which Thou didst reject, and which are  usually called \"temptations.\" Yea; if ever there was on earth a  genuine striking wonder produced, it was on that day of Thy three  temptations, and it is precisely in these three short sentences  that the marvelous miracle is contained. If it were possible that  they should vanish and disappear for ever, without leaving any  trace, from the record and from the memory of man, and that it  should become necessary again to devise, invent, and make them  reappear in Thy history once more, thinkest Thou that all the  world's sages, all the legislators, initiates, philosophers and  thinkers, if called upon to frame three questions which should,  like these, besides answering the magnitude of the event, express  in three short sentences the whole future history of  this our  world and of mankind--dost Thou believe, I ask Thee, that all  their combined efforts could ever create anything equal in power  and depth of thought to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#2)"],[1,"'    'Madam,' replied the king, 'I am convinced of the truth of what you  say; but till this moment I was of opinion that a person beautiful  like yourself, whom her evil destiny had condemned to be a slave,  ought to think herself very happy in meeting with a king for her  master.'    'Sire,' replied the fair slave, 'whatever the slave is, there is no  king on earth who can tyrannise over her will. But when this very  slave is in nothing inferior to the king that bought her, your  majesty shall then judge yourself of her misery, and her sorrow,  and to what desperate attempts the anguish of despair may drive  her.'    The King of Persia, in great astonishment, said 'Madam, can it be  possible that you are of royal blood? Explain the whole secret to  me, I beseech you, and no longer increase my impatience. Let me  instantly know who are your parents, your brothers, your sisters,  and your relations; but, above all, what your name is.'    'Sire,' said the fair slave, 'my name is Gulnare, Rose of the Sea;  and my father, who is now dead, was one of the most potent monarchs  of the ocean. When he died, he left his kingdom to a brother of  mine, named Saleh, and to the queen, my mother, who is also a  princess, the daughter of another powerful monarch of the sea. We  enjoyed a profound peace and tranquillity through the whole  kingdom, till a neighbouring prince, envious of our happiness,  invaded our dominions with a mighty army; and penetrating as far as  our capital, made himself master of it; and we had but just time  enough to save ourselves in an impenetrable and inaccessible place,  with a few trusty officers who did not forsake us in our distress.    'In this retreat my brother contrived all manner of ways to drive  the unjust invader from our dominions. One day \"Sister,\" said he,  \"I may fail in the attempt I intend to make to recover my kingdom;  and I shall be less concerned for my own disgrace than for what may  possibly happen to you. To prevent it, and to secure you from all  accident, I would fain see you married first: but in the miserable  condition of our affairs at present, I see no probability of  matching you to any of the princes of the sea; and therefore I  should be very glad if you would think of marrying some of the  princes of the earth I am ready to contribute all that lies in my  power towards it; and I am certain there is not one of them,  however powerful, but would be proud of sharing his crown with  you.\"    'At this discourse of my brother's, I fell into a violent passion.  \"Brother,\" said I, \"you know that I am descended, as well as you,  by both father's and mother's side, from the kings and queens of  the sea, without any mixture of alliance with those of the earth;  therefore I do not intend to marry below myself, any more than they  did. The condition to which we are reduced shall never oblige me to  alter my resolution; and if you perish in the execution of your  design, I am prepared to fall with you, rather than to follow the  advice I so little expected from you.\"    'My brother, who was still earnest for the marriage, however  improper for me, endeavoured to make me believe that there were  kings of the earth who were nowise inferior to those of the sea.  This put me into a more violent passion, which occasioned him to  say several bitter words that stung me to the quick. He left me as  much dissatisfied with myself as he could possibly be with me; and  in this peevish mood I gave a spring from the bottom of the sea up  to the island of the moon.    'Notwithstanding the violent displeasure that made me cast myself  upon that island, I lived content in retirement. But in spite of  all my precautions, a person of distinction, attended by his  servants, surprised me sleeping, and carried me to his own house,  and wished me to marry him. When he saw that fair means would not  prevail upon me, he attempted to make use of force; but I soon made  him repent of his insolence. So at last he resolved to sell me;  which he did to that very merchant who brought me hither and sold  me to your majesty. This man was a very prudent, courteous, humane  person, and during the whole of the long journey, never gave me the  least reason to complain.    'As for your majesty,' continued Queen Gulnare, 'if you had not  shown me all the respect you have hitherto paid, and given me such  undeniable marks of your affection that I could no longer doubt of  it, I hesitate not to tell you plainly that I should not have  remained with you. I would have thrown myself into the sea out of  this very window, and I would have gone in search of my mother, my  brother, and the rest of my relations; and, therefore, I hope you  will no longer look upon me as a slave, but as a princess worthy of  your alliance.'    After this manner Queen Gulnare discovered herself to the King of  Persia, and finished her story. 'My charming, my adorable queen,'  cried he, 'what wonders have I heard! I must ask a thousand  questions concerning those strange and unheard-of things which you  have related to me. I beseech you to tell me more about the kingdom  and people of the sea, who are altogether unknown to me. I have  heard much talk, indeed, of the inhabitants of the sea, but I  always looked upon it as nothing but a tale or fable; but, by what  you have told me, I am convinced there is nothing more true; and I  have a very good proof of it in your own person, who are one of  them, and are pleased to condescend to be my wife; which is an  honour no other inhabitant on the earth can boast of besides  myself. There is one thing yet which puzzles me; therefore I must  beg the favour of you to explain it; that is, I cannot comprehend  how it is possible for you to live or move in the water without  being drowned. There are very few amongst us who have the art of  staying under water; and they would surely perish, if, after a  certain time, they did not come up again.'    'Sire,' replied Queen Gulnare, 'I shall with pleasure satisfy the  King of Persia. We can walk at the bottom of the sea with as much  ease as you can upon land; and we can breathe in the water as you  do in the air; so that instead of suffocating us, as it does you,  it absolutely contributes to the preservation of our lives. What is  yet more remarkable is, that it never wets our clothes; so that  when we have a mind to visit the earth, we have no occasion to dry  them. Our common language is the same as that of the writing  engraved upon the seal of the great prophet Solomon, the son of  David.    'I must not forget to tell you, further, that the water does not in  the least hinder us from seeing in the sea; for we can open our  eyes without any inconvenience; and as we have quick, piercing  sight, we can discern any object as clearly in the deepest part of  the sea as upon land. We have also there a succession of day and  night; the moon affords us her light, and even the planets and the  stars appear visible to us. I have already spoken of our kingdoms;  but as the sea is much more spacious than the earth, so there are a  greater number of them, and of greater extent. They are divided  into provinces; and in each province there are several great  cities, well peopled. In short, there are an infinite number of  nations, differing in manners and customs, just as upon the earth.    'The palaces of the kings and princes are very sumptuous and  magnificent. Some of them are of marble of various colours; others  of rock-crystal, with which the sea abounds, mother of pearl,  coral, and of other materials more valuable; gold, silver, and all  sorts of precious stones are more plentiful there than on earth. I  say nothing of the pearls, since the largest that ever were seen  upon earth would not be valued amongst us; and none but the very  lowest rank of citizens would wear them.    'As we can transport ourselves whither we please in the twinkling  of an eye, we have no occasion for any carriages or riding-horses;  not but what the king has his stables, and his stud of sea-horses;  but they are seldom made use of, except upon public feasts or  rejoicing days. Some, after they have trained them, take delight in  riding them, and show their skill and dexterity in races; others  put them to chariots of mother-of-pearl, adorned with an infinite  number of shells of all sorts, of the brightest colours. These  chariots are open; and in the middle there is a throne upon which  the king sits, and shows himself to his subjects. The horses are  trained up to draw by themselves; so that there is no occasion for  a charioteer to guide them. I pass over a thousand other curious  particulars relating to these marine countries, which would be very  entertaining to your majesty; but you must permit me to defer it to  a future leisure, to speak of something of much greater  consequence. I should like to send for my mother and my cousins,  and at the same time to desire the king my brother's company, to  whom I have a great desire to be reconciled. They will be very glad  to see me again, after I have related my story to them, and when  they understand I am wife to the mighty king of Persia. I beseech  your majesty to give me leave to send for them: I am sure they will  be happy to pay their respects to you; and I venture to say you  will be extremely pleased to see them.'    'Madam,' replied the King of Persia, 'you are mistress; do whatever  you please; I will endeavour to receive them with all the honours  they deserve. But I would fain know how you would acquaint them  with what you desire, and when they will arrive, that I may give  orders to make preparation for their reception, and go myself in  person to meet them.'    'Sire,' replied the Queen Gulnare, 'there is no need of these  ceremonies; they will be here in a moment; and if your Majesty will  but look through the lattice, you shall see the manner of their  arrival.'    Queen Gulnare then ordered one of her women to"]]]
