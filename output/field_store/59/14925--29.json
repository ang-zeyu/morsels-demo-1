I have therefore determined,\" he continues,  \"for my own part to abandon my old quantity numbers, and to express my  results on the basis of a unit which shall be at once scientific and  convenient.\"    The discovery by Faraday of the law of electro-chemical equivalents  had induced him to propose the voltameter as a measurer of electric  currents, but the system proposed had not been used in the researches  of any electrician, not excepting those of Faraday himself. Joule,  realizing for the first time the importance of having a system of  electric measurement which would make experimental results obtained  at different times and under various circumstances comparable among  themselves, and perceiving at the same time the advantages of a system  of electric measurement dependent on, or at any rate comparable with,  the chemical action producing the electric current, adopted as unit  quantity of electricity the quantity required to decompose nine grains  of water, 9 being the atomic weight of water, according to the chemical  nomenclature then in use.    He had already made and described very important improvements in the  construction of galvanometers, and he graduated his tangent galvanometer  to correspond with the system of electric measurement he had adopted.  The electric currents used in his experiments were thenceforth measured  on the new system; and the numbers given in Joule's papers from 1840  downward are easily reducible to the modern absolute system of electric  measurements, in the construction and general introduction of which  he himself took so prominent a part. It was in 1840, also, that after  experimenting on improvements in voltaic apparatus, he turned his  attention to \"the heat evolved by metallic conductors of electricity and  in the cells of a battery during electrolysis.\" In this paper, and those  following it in 1841 and 1842, he laid the foundation of a new province  in physical science-electric and chemical thermodynamics-then totally  unknown, but now wonderfully familiar, even to the roughest common sense  practical electrician. With regard to the heat evolved by a metallic  conductor carrying an electric current, he established what was already  supposed to be the law, namely, that \"the quantity of heat evolved by  it [in a given time] is always proportional to the resistance which it  presents, whatever may be the length, thickness, shape, or kind of the  metallic conductor,\" while he obtained the law, then unknown, that  the heat evolved is proportional to the _square_ of the quantity of  electricity passing in a given time. Corresponding laws were established  for the heat evolved by the current passing in the electrolytic cell,  and likewise for the heat developed in the cells of the battery itself.    In the year 1840 he was already speculating on the transformation of  chemical energy into heat. In the paper last referred to and in a short  abstract in the _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, December, 1840, he  points out that the heat generated in a wire conveying a current of  electricity is a part of the heat of chemical combination of the  materials used in the voltaic cell, and that the remainder, not the  whole heat of combination, is evolved within the cell in which the  chemical action takes place. In papers given in 1841 and 1842, he pushes  his investigations further, and shows that the sum of the heat produced  in all parts of the circuit during voltaic action is proportional to the  chemical action that goes on in the voltaic pile, and again, that the  quantities of heat which are evolved by the combustion of equivalents  of bodies are proportional to the intensities of their affinities for  oxygen. Having proceeded thus far, he carried on the same train of  reasoning and experiment till he was able to announce in January, 1843,  that the magneto-electric machine enables us to _convert mechanical  power into heat_. Most of his spare time in the early part of the year  1843 was devoted to making experiments necessary for the discovery of  the laws of the development of heat by magneto-electricity, and for the  definite determination of the mechanical value of heat.    At the meeting of the British Association at Cork, on August 21, 1843,  he read his paper \"On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity,  and on the Mechanical Value of Heat.\" The paper gives an account of an  admirable series of experiments, proving that _heat is generated_ (not  merely _transferred_ from some source) by the magneto-electric machine.  The investigation was pushed on for the purpose of finding whether a  _constant ratio exists between the heat generated and the mechanical  power_ used in its production. As the result of one set of  magneto-electric experiments, he finds 838 foot pounds to be the  mechanical equivalent of the quantity of heat capable of increasing the  temperature of one pound of water by one degree of Fahrenheit's scale.  The paper is dated Broomhill, July, 1843, but a postscript, dated  August, 1843, contains the following sentences:    \"We shall be obliged to admit that Count Rumford was right in  attributing the heat evolved by boring cannon to friction, and not (in  any considerable degree) to any change in the capacity of the metal. I  have lately proved experimentally that _heat is evolved by the passage  of water through narrow tubes_. My apparatus consisted of a piston  perforated by a number of small holes, working in a cylindrical glass  jar containing about 7 lb. of water. I thus obtained one degree of heat  per pound of water from a mechanical force capable of raising about 770  lb. to the height of one foot, a result which will be allowed to be very  strongly confirmatory of our previous deductions. I shall lose no time  in repeating and extending these experiments, being satisfied that the  grand agents of nature are, by the Creator's fiat, _indestructible_, and  that wherever mechanical force is expended, an exact equivalent of heat  is _always_ obtained.\"    This was the first determination of the dynamical equivalent of heat.  Other naturalists and experimenters about the same time were attempting  to compare the quantity of heat produced under certain circumstances  with the quantity of work expended in producing it; and results and  deductions (some of them very remarkable) were given by Seguin (1839),  Mayer (1842), Colding (1843), founded partly on experiment, and partly  on a kind of metaphysical reasoning. It was Joule, however, who first  definitely proposed the problem of determining the relation between heat  produced and work done in any mechanical action, and solved the problem  directly.    It is not to be supposed that Joule's discovery and the results of his  investigation met with immediate attention or with ready acquiescence.  The problem occupied him almost continuously for many years; and in 1878  he gives in the _Philosophical Transactions_ the results of a fresh  determination, according to which the quantity of work required to be  expended in order to raise the temperature of one pound of water weighed  in vacuum from 60 deg. to 61 deg. Fahr., is 772.55 foot pounds of work at the  sea level and in the latitude of Greenwich. His results of 1849 and 1878  agree in a striking manner with those obtained by Hirn and with those  derived from an elaborate series of experiments carried out by Prof.  Rowland, at the expense of the Government of the United States.    His experiments subsequent to 1843 on the dynamical equivalent of  heat must be mentioned briefly. In that year his father removed from  Pendlebury to Oak Field, Whalley Range, on the south side of Manchester,  and built for his son a convenient laboratory near to the house. It was  at this time that he felt the pressing need of accurate thermometers;  and while Regnault was doing the same thing in France, Mr. Joule  produced, with the assistance of Mr. Dancer, instrument maker, of  Manchester, the first English thermometers possessing such accuracy  as the mercury-in-glass thermometer is capable of. Some of them were  forwarded to Prof. Graham and to Prof. Lyon Playfair; and the production  of these instruments was in itself a most important contribution to  scientific equipment.    As the direct experiment of friction of a fluid is dependent on no  hypothesis, and appears to be wholly unexceptionable, it was used by Mr.  Joule repeatedly in modified forms. The stirring of mercury, of oil,  and of water with a paddle, which was turned by a falling weight,  was compared, and solid friction, the friction of iron on iron under  mercury, was tried; but the simple stirring of water seemed preferable  to any, and was employed in all his later determinations.    In 1847 Mr. Joule was married to Amelia, daughter of Mr. John Grimes,  Comptroller of Customs, Liverpool. His wife died early (1854), leaving  him one son and one daughter.    The meeting of the British Association at Oxford, in this year, proved  an interesting and important one. Here Joule read a fresh paper \"On the  Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.\" Of this meeting Sir William Thomson  writes as follows to the author of this notice:    \"I made Joule's acquaintance at the Oxford meeting, and it quickly  ripened into a lifelong friendship.    \"I heard his paper read in the section, and felt strongly impelled at  first to rise and say that it must be wrong, because the true mechanical  value of heat given, suppose in warm water, must, for small differences  of temperature, be proportional to the square of its quantity. I knew  from Carnot that this _must_ be true (and it _is_ true; only now I call  it 'motivity,' to avoid clashing with Joule's 'mechanical value'). But  as I listened on and on, I saw that (though Carnot had vitally important  truth, not to be abandoned) Joule had certainly a great truth and a  great discovery, and a most important measurement to bring forward. So,  instead of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8467"],[0,"Frost's Laws and By-Laws of American Society (#2)"],[1," comfort into an inconvenient and  burdensome restraint upon freedom and ease. It may become the  first consideration, instead of more properly the second, as is  often the case with the instrumental accompaniment to a song, and  then it becomes, as does the accompaniment, an intolerable  nuisance. The mere form, over-riding and hiding the spirit which  should control and guide it; an entirely artificial state of  things, taking the place of the natural, must inevitably produce  discomfort and extravagance of behavior. Nature is thus made the  slave of Art, instead of Art taking its proper place as the  handmaid to Nature.    Etiquette, to be perfect, therefore, must be like a perfectly  fitting garment, which, beautifying and adorning the person, must  yet never cramp or restrain perfect freedom of movement. Any  visible restraint will mar its grace, as a wrinkle will mar the  pure outline of the garment.    Most people have heard of the gentleman (?) who was perfect in his  knowledge of the laws of etiquette, and who, seeing a man  drowning, took off his coat and was about to plunge into the water  to rescue him, when he suddenly remembered that he had never been  introduced to the struggling victim, and resuming his coat,  tranquilly proceeded upon his way.    Not less absurd are a thousand instances where a regard for formal  mannerism takes the place of the easy grace that is the mark of  true politeness, which being well acquired and habitual, is never  obtrusive or offensively prominent. Too rigid an observance of the  laws of etiquette makes them an absurdity and a nuisance.    But, because the laws of etiquette may be made a restraint under  injudicious management, it does not follow that they should be  disregarded or in any way set aside. The abuse of them is no  argument against them, any more than gluttony is any reason for  starvation. It is not the food that is in fault, but the excess of  the person partaking of it. The fault must be laid wholly and  solely at the door of those who misunderstand the use and  intention of really sound and excellent precepts. The extravagance  of an overdisplay of etiquette is really only another form of  innate vulgarity, although there are instances which may be drawn  from the side of over refinement, from the history of people and  societies, who become extravagant in their devotion to what they  deem good breeding, simply because, like the stars that looked  down upon Molly Bawn, \"they'd nothing else to do.\"    There are to be found, even in grave history--amid the records of  war, treaties, conquests, administrations and revolutions--  accounts given in equally grave language of deep questions of  etiquette which seem to have been debated and settled with as much  care and energy as the most serious questions of state affairs.  Cases of this sort are announced and well founded. Whoever likes  to see the extent to which attention was given to the subject can  seek instances in the memoirs of public characters who lived in  the seventeenth century, in the diaries of minute detailers like  the Duke de St. Simon, Page to His Most Christian Majesty, Louis  the Fourteenth; like Sir John Finett, Master of Ceremonies to  Charles the First, and in the domestic histories of the courtiers  and grandees of the Spanish and Venetian courts.    Fortunately, the time has gone by when nice questions about  trifling points of etiquette served to light the flame of civil  war, as once they did in France, and to set the whole of the upper  class in a kingdom in arms. We owe this, perhaps, as much to the  general increase of civilization as to the working of any  particular set of rules or system. But the principle which  actuated the French nobility, at the time alluded to, is an  inherent one in the human mind, and would be likely to repeat  itself in some shape or another, not so violently perhaps, but  still to repeat itself, were it not kept in check by the known  laws of society.    Mr. Buckle tells us that as late as the reign of Louis the  Fourteenth, the right to sit in the presence of the French king  \"was considered to be a matter of such gravity that in comparison  with it a mere struggle for liberty faded into insignificance.\"  There was a perpetual striving which should be accounted greatest.  According to the old code of etiquette, a duke's wife might sit in  the French queen's presence, but no one under that rank could do  so. A combination of marquises, counts, and other nobles was  formed and wrung from the hand of Louis the Fourteenth, this  concession that the ladies of the house of Bouillon might sit in  the presence of the queen. But this was fuel to the fire of the  combined noblemen's anger; two hostile parties were formed, and  the question of etiquette was nearly being decided by the sword.  It required all the tact and statesmanship of Mazarin to prevent  this, and in the end the right was conceded to three of the most  distinguished ladies of the lower aristocracy, to sit down in the  presence of the queen. Upon this, the superior nobility summoned  their adherents to Paris, and really a severe struggle followed,  which ended in the last mentioned concession being revoked; and so  great was the importance attached to the revocation that nothing  would satisfy the nobles short of the public withdrawal being  drawn up in a state paper, signed by the queen's regent,  countersigned by the four secretaries of state, and conveyed to  the assembly of nobles by four marshals of France.    The French memoirs of this period (the seventeenth century) abound  with references to just such questions of court etiquette; who  might use an arm-chair at court; who was to be invited to the  royal dinner; who might be kissed by the queen; what degree of  nobility entitled a man to be driven to the Louvre in a coach;  whether all dukes were equal, or whether, as some thought, the  Duke de Bouillon, having once possessed the sovereignty of Sedan,  was superior to the Duke de la Rochefoucauld, who had never  possessed any sovereignty at all; who should give the king his  napkin at dinner, and who might have the honor of assisting at the  toilet of the queen. The question whether the Duke de Beaufort  ought or ought not to enter the council chamber before the Duke de  Nemours, and whether, being there, he ought or ought not to sit  above him, caused a violent quarrel between the two dukes in 1652,  a quarrel which, of course, ended in a duel, and the death of the  Duke de Nemours. The equally grave question, whether a duke should  sign before a marshal was violently disputed between the Duke de  Rohan and one of the marshals of Henry the Fourth, and the king  was obliged to interfere in the matter.    These, of course, are but so many instances of the principle of  etiquette carried to an extravagant length, and simply prove the  danger there is in allowing things of less importance to supersede  or take the precedence of those of greater weight. They serve to  explain, and in some measure to excuse the denunciatory  expressions which many thoroughly well-bred people use against  etiquette, such expressions being, as before suggested, merely  protests uttered in anticipation of a repetition of the absurdity  which over-attention to ceremonies is liable to introduce.    But such cases are really no argument against etiquette itself,  without deference to which it would be impossible to live in  anything like freedom from annoyance from persons naturally  impertinent, or in the full enjoyment of that social liberty which  every one has a right to expect.    Good breeding is, as Lord Chesterfield well says, \"the result of  much good sense, some good nature, and a little self-denial for  the sake of others, and with a view to obtain the same indulgence  from them.\" Lord Bacon, in his admirable essay on Ceremonies,  says:    \"Not to use ceremonies at all, is to teach others not to use them  again, and so diminisheth respect to himself; especially they be  not to be omitted to strangers and formal natures; but the  dwelling upon them, and exalting them above the moon is not only  tedious, but doth diminish the faith and credit of him that  speaks.\"    To quote again from Lord Chesterfield, who says:    \"Good sense and good nature suggest civility in general; but in  good breeding there are a thousand little delicacies which are  established only by custom.\"    It is precisely these \"little delicacies\" which constitute the  difference between politeness and etiquette. Politeness is that  inborn regard for others which may dwell in the heart of the most  ignorant boor, but etiquette is a code of outward laws which must  be learned by the resident in good society, either from  observation or the instruction of others.    It is a poor argument used against etiquette that it is not  truthful, and that uncouth manners are more frank and sincere than  polished and refined ones. Is truth then a hedgehog, always 3  bristling and offensive. Cannot truth be spoken in courteous  accents from a kind, gentle impulse, as well as blurted out rudely  and giving pain and mortification? It is true that roughness and  sincerity often abide together, but would it destroy the honesty  to polish away the roughness?    Etiquette, it is sometimes urged, is used to cloak what is hollow,  unmeaning and false, yet may it not also drape gracefully what is  true, sincere and important?    True politeness must come from the heart, from an unselfish desire  to please others and contribute to their happiness; when upon this  natural impulse is placed the polish of a complete and thorough  knowledge of the laws of etiquette, the manners must be perfect  and graceful.    Etiquette added to natural politeness is as a beautiful jewel upon  a tasteful dress. Ruskin thus defines a gentleman:    \"A gentleman's first character is that firmness of structure in  the body which renders it capable of the most delicate"]]]
