The first,  If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse  Been manifested, by transparency  Of light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.  But this is not.  Therefore remains to see  The other cause: and if the other fall,  Erroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee.  If not from side to side this rarity  Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence  Its contrary no further lets it pass.  And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,  Must be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glass  Reflected, which behind it lead conceals.  Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue  Than in the other part the ray is shown,  By being thence refracted farther back.  From this perplexity will free thee soon  Experience, if thereof thou trial make,  The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.  Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove  From thee alike, and more remote the third.  Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;  Then turn'd toward them, cause behind thy back  A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,  And thus reflected come to thee from all.  Though that beheld most distant do not stretch  A space so ample, yet in brightness thou  Will own it equaling the rest.  But now,  As under snow the ground, if the warm ray  Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue  And cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,  Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform  With light so lively, that the tremulous beam  Shall quiver where it falls.  Within the heaven,  Where peace divine inhabits, circles round  A body, in whose virtue dies the being  Of all that it contains.  The following heaven,  That hath so many lights, this being divides,  Through  different essences, from it distinct,  And yet contain'd within it.  The other orbs  Their separate distinctions variously  Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt.  Thus do these organs of the world proceed,  As thou beholdest now, from step to step,  Their influences from above deriving,  And thence transmitting downwards.  Mark me well,  How through this passage to the truth I ford,  The truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,  May'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.    \"The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,  As mallet by the workman's hand, must needs  By blessed movers be inspir'd.  This heaven,  Made beauteous by so many luminaries,  From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,  Its image takes an impress as a seal:  And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,  Through members different, yet together form'd,  In different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en so  The intellectual efficacy unfolds  Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;  On its own unity revolving still.  Different virtue compact different  Makes with the precious body it enlivens,  With which it knits, as life in you is knit.  From its original nature full of joy,  The virtue mingled through the body shines,  As joy through pupil of the living eye.  From hence proceeds, that which from light to light  Seems different, and not from dense or rare.  This is the formal cause, that generates  Proportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear.\"          CANTO III    That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'd  Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect,  By proof of right, and of the false reproof;  And I, to own myself convinc'd and free  Of doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my head  Erect for speech.  But soon a sight appear'd,  Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd,  That of confession I no longer thought.    As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave  Clear and unmov'd, and flowing not so deep  As that its bed is dark, the shape returns  So faint of our impictur'd lineaments,  That on white forehead set a pearl as strong  Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,  All stretch'd to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'd  Delusion opposite to that, which rais'd  Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.    Sudden, as I perceiv'd them, deeming these  Reflected semblances to see of whom  They were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;  Then turn'd them back, directed on the light  Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams  From her celestial eyes.  \"Wonder not thou,\"  She cry'd, \"at this my smiling, when I see  Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth  It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,  Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.  True substances are these, which thou behold'st,  Hither through failure of their vow exil'd.  But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,  That the true light, which fills them with desire,  Permits not from its beams their feet to stray.\"    Straight to the shadow which for converse seem'd  Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,  As one by over-eagerness perplex'd:  \"O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays  Of life eternal, of that sweetness know'st  The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far  All apprehension, me it well would please,  If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this  Your station here.\" Whence she, with kindness prompt,  And eyes glist'ning with smiles: \"Our charity,  To any wish by justice introduc'd,  Bars not the door, no more than she above,  Who would have all her court be like herself.  I was a virgin sister in the earth;  And if thy mind observe me well, this form,  With such addition grac'd of loveliness,  Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know  Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,  Here 'mid these other blessed also blest.  Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone  With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,  Admitted to his order dwell in joy.  And this condition, which appears so low,  Is for this cause assign'd us, that our vows  Were in some part neglected and made void.\"    Whence I to her replied: \"Something divine  Beams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,  From former knowledge quite transmuting you.  Therefore to recollect was I so slow.  But what thou sayst hath to my memory  Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms  Is easier.  Yet inform me, ye, who here  Are happy, long ye for a higher place  More to behold, and more in love to dwell?\"    She with those other spirits gently smil'd,  Then answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'd  With love's first flame to glow: \"Brother! our will  Is in composure settled by the power  Of charity, who makes us will alone  What we possess, and nought beyond desire;  If we should wish to be exalted more,  Then must our wishes jar with the high will  Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs  Thou wilt confess not possible, if here  To be in charity must needs befall,  And if her nature well thou contemplate.  Rather it is inherent in this state  Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within  The divine will, by which our wills with his  Are one.  So that as we from step to step  Are plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases all,  E'en as our King, who in us plants his will;  And in his will is our tranquillity;  It is the mighty ocean, whither tends  Whatever it creates and nature makes.\"    Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n  Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew  The supreme virtue show'r not over all.    But as it chances, if one sort of food  Hath satiated, and of another still  The appetite remains, that this is ask'd,  And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I  In word and motion, bent from her to learn  What web it was, through which she had not drawn  The shuttle to its point.  She thus began:  \"Exalted worth and perfectness of life  The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,  By whose pure laws upon your nether earth  The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,  That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep  With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,  Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.  from the world, to follow her, when young  Escap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,  Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.  Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,  Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.  God knows how after that my life was fram'd.  This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst  At my right side, burning with all the light  Of this our orb, what of myself I tell  May to herself apply.  From her, like me  A sister, with like violence were torn  The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.  E'en when she to the world again was brought  In spite of her own will and better wont,  Yet not for that the bosom's inward veil  Did she renounce.  This is the luminary  Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,  Which blew the second over Suabia's realm,  That power produc'd, which was the third and last.\"    She ceas'd from further talk, and then began  \"Ave Maria\" singing, and with that song  Vanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave.    Mine eye, that far as it was capable,  Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,  Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,  And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.  But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:  So that the sight sustain'd it not at first.  Whence I to question her became less prompt.          CANTO IV    Between two kinds of food, both equally  Remote and tempting, first a man might die  Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose.  E'en so would stand a lamb between the maw  Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:  E'en so between two deer a dog would stand,  Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise  I to myself impute, by equal doubts  Held in suspense, since of necessity  It happen'd.  Silent was I, yet desire  Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake  My wish more earnestly than language could.    As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed  From ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust  And violent; so look'd Beatrice then.    \"Well I discern,\" she thus her words address'd,  \"How contrary desires each way constrain thee,  So that thy anxious thought is in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],[0,"Drum-Taps (#2)"],[1,"me at least be human! Human, indeed, he was, a  tender, all-welcoming host of Everyman, of his idolized (if somewhat  overpowering) American democracy. Man in the street, in his swarms, poor  crazed faces in the State asylum, prisoners in Sing Sing, prostitute,  whose dead body reminded him not of a lost soul, but only of a sad,  forlorn, and empty house--it mattered not; he opened his heart to them,  one and all. \"I see beyond each mark that wonder, a kindred soul. O the  bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend.\"      The moon gives you light,    And the bugles and drums give you music,    And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,    My heart gives you love.    \"Yours for you,\" he exclaims, welding in a phrase his unparalleled  egotism, his beautiful charity, \"yours for you, who ever you are, as mine  for me.\" It is the essence of philosophy and of religion, for all the  wonders of heaven and earth are significant \"only because of the Me in  the centre.\"    This was the secret of his tender, unassuming ministrations. He had none  of that shrinking timidity, that fear of intrusion, that uneasiness in  the presence of the tragic and the pitiful, which so often numb and  oppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the  needy and suffering, but whose intellect misgives them. He was that  formidable phenomenon, a dreamer of action. But he possessed a sovran  good sense. Food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous  preparation for his visits. He always assumed as cheerful an appearance  as possible. Armed with bright new five-cent and ten-cent bills (the  wounded, he found, were often \"broke,\" and the sight of a little money  \"helped their spirits\"), with books and stationery and tobacco, for one a  twist of good strong green tea, for another a good home-made  rice-pudding, or a jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry  syrup, a small bottle of horse-radish pickle, or a large handsome apple,  he would \"make friends.\" \"What I have I also give you,\" he cried from the  bottom of his grieved, tempestuous heart. He would talk, or write  letters--passionate love-letters, too--or sit silent, in mute and tender  kindness. \"Long, long, I gazed ... leaning my chin in my hands, passing  sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade--not a  tear, not a word, Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son  and my soldier.\" And how many a mother must have blessed the stranger who  could bring such last news of a son as this: \"And now like many other  noble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier, he has  yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service. Such things  are gloomy--yet there is a text, 'God doeth all things well'--the meaning  of which, after due time, appears to the soul.\" It is only love that can  comfort the loving.    He forced nothing on these friends of a day, so many of them near their  last farewell. A poor wasted young man asks him to read a chapter in the  New Testament, and Whitman chooses that which describes Christ's  Crucifixion. He \"ask'd me to read the following chapter also, how Christ  rose again. I read very slowly, for he was feeble. It pleased him very  much, yet the tears were in his eyes. He ask'd me if I enjoy'd religion.  I said 'Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, yet maybe, it is the  same thing.'\" This is only one of many such serene intimacies in  Whitman's experiences of the war. Through them we reach to an  understanding of a poet who chose not signal and beautiful episodes out  of the past, nor the rare moments of existence, for theme, but took all  life, within and around him in vast bustling America, for his poetic  province. Like a benign barbaric sun he surveys the world, ever at noon.  I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there, he cries in the \"Song of Myself.\"  I do not despise you priests, all times, the world over.... He could not  despise anything, not even his fellow-poets, because he himself was  everything. His verse sometimes seems mere verbiage, but it is always a  higgledy-piggledy, Santa Claus bagful of _things_. And he could penetrate  to the essential reality. He tells in his \"Drum-Taps\" how one daybreak he  arose in camp, and saw three still forms stretched out in the eastern  radiance, how with light fingers he just lifted the blanket from each  cold face in turn: the first elderly, gaunt, and grim--Who are you, my  dear comrade? The next with cheeks yet blooming--Who are you, sweet boy?  The third--Young man, I think I know you. I think this face is the face  of the Christ Himself, Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again  he lies.    True poetry focuses experience, not merely transmits it. It must redeem  it for ever from transitoriness and evanescence. Whitman incontinently  pours experience out in a Niagara-like cataract. But in spite of his  habitual publicity he was at heart of a \"shy, brooding, impassioned  devotional type\"; in spite of his self-conscious, arrogant virility, he  was to the end of his life an entranced child. He came into the world,  saw and babbled. His deliberate method of writing could have had no other  issue. A subject would occur to him, a kind of tag. He would scribble it  down on a scrap of paper and drop it into a drawer. Day by day this first  impulse would evoke fresh \"poemets,\" until at length the accumulation was  exhaustive. Then he merely gutted his treasury and the ode was complete.  It was only when sense and feeling attained a sort of ecstasy that he  succeeded in distilling the true essence that is poetry and in enstopping  it in a crystal phial of form.    The prose of his \"Specimen Days,\" indeed, is often nearer to poetry than  his verse:        Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps.... I often come and      sit by him in perfect silence; he will breathe for ten minutes as      softly and evenly as a young babe asleep. Poor youth, so      handsome, athletic, with profuse beautiful shining hair. One time      as I sat looking at him while he lay asleep, he suddenly, without      the least start awaken'd, open'd his eyes, gave me a long steady      look, turning his face very slightly to gaze easier--one long,      clear, silent look--a slight sigh--then turn'd back and went into      his doze again. Little he knew, poor death-stricken boy, the      heart of the stranger that hover'd near.        The western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening has      never been so large, so clear; it seems as if it told something,      as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity, with us Americans.      The sky dark blue, the transparent night, the planets, the      moderate west wind, the elastic temperature, the miracle of that      great star, and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west,      suffused the soul. Then I heard slow and clear the deliberate      notes of a bugle come up out of the silence ... firm and      faithful, floating along, rising, falling leisurely, with here      and there a long-drawn note.... sounding tattoo.    \"A steady rain, dark and thick and warm,\" he writes again, two days after  Gettysburg. \"The cavalry camp is a ceaseless field of observation to me.  This forenoon there stood the horses, tether'd together, dripping,  steaming, chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping  also. The fires are half-quench'd.\" There is a poetic poise in this  brief, vivid statement, apart from its bare economy of means. It is the  lump awaiting the leaven no less than is \"Cavalry Crossing a Ford.\" To  this supreme spectator an apple orchard in May, even the White House in  moonlight, no more and no less than these battle-scenes, rendered up  their dignity, life, and beauty, their true human significance. But in  \"Drum-Taps\" the witness is not always so satisfactory. The secret has  evaporated in the effort to _make_ poetry, or half-consciously to inject  a moral, to play the Universal Bard. There creeps into the words a tinge  of the raw and the grotesque. The poet has the look of a cowboy off the  stage, tanned with grease-paint. But again and again the secret creeps  back and some lovely emanation of poetry is added to it:      Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,    Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,              purple,    On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,    Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.    Or this, called \"Reconciliation\":      Word over all, beautiful as the sky,    Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be              utterly lost,    That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash              again, and ever again, this soil'd world;    For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,    I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin--I draw              near,    Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the              coffin.    The bonds of rhyme shackled him, deprived him of more than freedom. He is  like a wild bird that suddenly perceives the bars of its small cage  across the blue of the sky. And yet the finer his poems are, the nearer  they approach to definite rhythmical design. One has only to compare \"O  Captain! my Captain!\" with \"Hushed be the Camps To-day\" to perceive this  curious paradox. They are both of them memories of his beloved Lincoln,  whom he had many times seen, with that peculiarly close and transatlantic  curiosity of his, riding at a jog-trot, on a good-sized, easy-going grey  horse, with his escort of yellow-striped cavalry behind him, through the  streets of Washington--dressed in black, somewhat rusty and dusty, with a  black, stiff hat, almost as ordinary in attire as the commonest man. That  heroic face, too, he had pierced; and caught from it the deep, subtle,  indirect expression, that only the long-gone master-painters of the Old  World could have seized and"]]]
