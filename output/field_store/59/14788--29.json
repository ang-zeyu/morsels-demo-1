Next morning, when he looked at his work again, Tip saw he had forgotten to  give the dummy a neck, by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to  the body. So he went again to the forest, which was not far away, and  chopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work.  When he returned he fastened a cross-piece        12  to the upper end of the body, making a hole through the center to hold  upright the neck. The bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened  at the upper end, and when all was ready Tip put on the pumpkin head,  pressing it well down onto the neck, and found that it fitted very well. The  head could be turned to one side or the other, as he pleased, and the hinges  of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he  desired.    \"Now, that,\" declared Tip, proudly, \"is really a very fine man, and it  ought to frighten several screeches out of old Mombi! But it would be much  more lifelike if it were properly dressed.\"    To find clothing seemed no easy task; but Tip boldly ransacked the great  chest in which Mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures, and at the very  bottom he discovered some purple trousers, a red shirt and a pink vest which  was dotted with white spots. These he carried away to his man and succeeded,  although the garments did not fit very well, in dressing the creature in a  jaunty fashion. Some knit stockings belonging to Mombi and a much worn pair  of his own shoes completed the man's apparel, and Tip was so delighted that  he danced up and down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy.        13    \"I must give him a name!\" he cried. \"So good a man as this must surely have  a name. I believe,\" he added, after a moment's thought, \"I will name the  fellow 'Jack Pumpkinhead!'\"                   Line-Art Drawing        14               Full page line-art drawing.        15               The Marvelous Powder of Life      After considering the matter carefully, Tip decided that the best place to  locate Jack would be at the bend in the road, a little way from the house.  So he started to carry his man there, but found him heavy and rather awkward  to handle. After dragging the creature a short distance Tip stood him on his  feet, and by first bending the joints of one leg, and then those of the  other, at the same time pushing from behind, the boy managed to induce Jack  to walk to the bend in the road. It was not accomplished without a few  tumbles, and Tip really worked harder than he ever had in the fields or        16  forest; but a love of mischief urged him on, and it pleased him to test the  cleverness of his workmanship.    \"Jack's all right, and works fine!\" he said to himself, panting with the  unusual exertion. But just then he discovered the man's left arm had fallen  off in the journey so he went back to find it, and afterward, by whittling a  new and stouter pin for the shoulder-joint, he repaired the injury so  successfully that the arm was stronger than before. Tip also noticed that  Jack's pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced his back; but this was  easily remedied. When, at last, the man was set up facing the turn in the  path where old Mombi was to appear, he looked natural enough to be a fair  imitation of a Gillikin farmer,--and unnatural enough to startle anyone  that came on him unawares.    As it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return home,  Tip went down into the valley below the farm-house and began to gather nuts  from the trees that grew there.    However, old Mombi returned earlier than usual. She had met a crooked  wizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains, and had traded  several important secrets of magic with him. Hav-        17  ing in this way secured three new recipes, four magical powders and a  selection of herbs of wonderful power and potency, she hobbled home as fast  as she could, in order to test her new sorceries.    So intent was Mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the  bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man, she merely nodded and  said:    \"Good evening, sir.\"    But, a moment after, noting that the person did not move or reply, she cast  a shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately  carved by Tip's jack-knife.    \"Heh!\" ejaculated Mombi, giving a sort of grunt; \"that rascally boy has  been playing tricks again! Very good! ve--ry good! I'll beat him black-  and-blue for trying to scare me in this fashion!\"    Angrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the  dummy; but a sudden thought made her pause, the uplifted stick left  motionless in the air.    \"Why, here is a good chance to try my new powder!\" said she, eagerly. \"And  then I can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded secrets, or  whether he has fooled me as wickedly as I fooled him.\"        18    So she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious  powders she had obtained.    While Mombi was thus occupied Tip strolled back, with his pockets full of  nuts, and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently  not the least bit frightened by it.    At first he was generally disappointed; but the next moment he became  curious to know what Mombi was going to do. So he hid behind a hedge, where  he could see without being seen, and prepared to watch.    After some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepper-box, upon the  faded label of which the wizard had written with a lead-pencil:    \"Powder of Life.\"    \"Ah--here it is!\" she cried, joyfully. \"And now let us see if it is  potent. The stingy wizard didn't give me much of it, but I guess there's  enough for two or three doses.\"    Tip was much surprised when he overheard this speech. Then he saw old Mombi  raise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of  his man Jack. She did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato,  and the powder sifted down from Jack's head and scattered        19               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"OLD MOMBI DANCED AROUND HIM\"        20  over the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers Tip had dressed  him in, and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn shoes.    Then, putting the pepper-box back into the basket, Mombi lifted her left  hand, with its little finger pointed upward, and said:    \"Weaugh!\"    Then she lifted her right hand, with the thumb pointed upward, and said:    \"Teaugh!\"    Then she lifted both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out, and  cried:    \"Peaugh!\"    Jack Pumpkinhead stepped back a pace, at this, and said in a reproachful  voice:    \"Don't yell like that! Do you think I'm deaf?\"    Old Mombi danced around him, frantic with delight.    \"He lives!\" she screamed: \"He lives! he lives!\"    Then she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down; and she  hugged herself with both arms, and tried to do a step of a jig; and all the  time she repeated, rapturously:    \"He lives!--he lives!--he lives!\"    Now you may well suppose that Tip observed all this with amazement.        21    At first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away, but  his legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldn't. Then it struck him as  a very funny thing for Jack to come to life, especially as the expression on  his pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the  instant. So, recovering from his first fear, Tip began to laugh; and the  merry peals reached old Mombi's ears and made her hobble quickly to the  hedge, where she seized Tip's collar and dragged him back to where she had  left her basket and the pumpkinheaded man.    \"You naughty, sneaking, wicked boy!\" she exclaimed, furiously: \"I'll teach  you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me!\"    \"I wasn't making fun of you,\" protested Tip. \"I was laughing at old  Pumpkinhead! Look at him! Isn't he a picture, though?\"    \"I hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance,\" said Jack; and it  was so funny to hear his grave voice, while his face continued to wear its  jolly smile, that Tip again burst into a peal of laughter.    Even Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had  brought to life; for, after staring at him intently, she presently asked:        22               Full page line-art drawing.                   OLD MOMBI PUTS JACK IN THE STABLE        23    \"What do you know?\"    \"Well, that is hard to tell,\" replied Jack. \"For although I feel that I  know a tremendous lot, I am not yet aware how much there is in the world to  find out about. It will take me a little time to discover whether I am very  wise or very foolish.\"    \"To be sure,\" said Mombi, thoughtfully.    \"But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?\" asked Tip,  wondering.    \"I must think it over,\" answered Mombi. \"But we must get home at once, for  it is growing dark. Help the Pumpkinhead to walk.\"    \"Never mind me,\" said Jack; \"I can walk as well as you can. Haven't I got  legs and feet, and aren't they jointed?\"    \"Are they?\" asked the woman, turning to Tip.    \"Of course they are; I made 'em myself,\" returned the boy, with pride.    So they started for the house, but when they reached the farm yard old  Mombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty  stall, fastening the door securely on the outside.    \"I've got to attend to you, first,\" she said, nodding her head at Tip.    Hearing this, the boy became uneasy; for he        24  knew Mombi had a bad and revengeful heart, and would not hesitate to do any  evil thing.    They entered the house. It was a round, domeshaped structure, as are nearly  all the farm houses in the Land of Oz.    Mombi bade the boy light a candle, while she put her basket in a cupboard  and hung her cloak on a peg. Tip obeyed quickly, for he was afraid of her.    After the candle had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#2)"],[1,"half-blinded person)    took that opportunity of plundering him.    ANABAPTIST.
