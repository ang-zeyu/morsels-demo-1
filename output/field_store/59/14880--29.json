It looked as though they had just come up trap-doors in the earth, so  suddenly did they show in sight.    \"Captain Mathias,\" said the disguised monk to the first who came up, \"I  have learnt all we wish to know.\"    \"You have?\" ejaculated, not the man addressed by the mendicant monk,  but the other. \"Out with it, then.\"    \"Still your impatience, Toro, if you can.--\"    \"Bah!\"    \"Well, then, learn that Mole goes as--\"    \"Bother Mole!\" interrupted Toro, harshly. \"How does our great foe go?\"    \"Harkaway?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"An English knight of old.\"    \"It shall be my task,\" said Toro, \"to keep up his character, and give  it a realistic look by a hand-to-hand fight.\"    \"Don't be rash,\" said the mendicant friar, \"or you may chance to be  beaten.\"    \"I can risk my life on it.\"    \"You have--you do; every hour that you live here imperils it. Did you  see the party go?\"    \"I did,\" said Mathias.    The latter was no other than the captain of the brigands. Already they  were upon a footing of equality, for the two adventurers had had  opportunities, which they had not failed to seize.    They had courage, ready wit, presence of mind, boldness daring, and  cunning, and so it fell out that they who had made the acquaintance of  the brigand's gang under such very unpleasant auspices, became two of  the principal members of it within a few days.    But to resume.    \"Tell me, Hunston,\" said Toro, \"does Jefferson go to the ball?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How disguised?\"    \"Julius Caesar.\"    The Italian said nothing, but his lips moved, and his lowering brow was  as expressive as words could be to his old comrade.    It boded ill for Jefferson.    They had met in fair fight, and he, Toro, had been defeated.    That defeat was as bitter as gall to him.    He would be avenged.    And if he could not cope with the doughty Anglo-American, then let him  look to it.    What strength and skill failed to achieve, the assassin's knife would  accomplish.    \"Did you see the girl that attended him to the gate?\" demanded the  mendicant friar, or Hunston, as it would be better to call him, since  there is no further need of concealment.    \"I did.\"    \"And recognised her, Mathias?\" he asked of the brigand captain.    \"Yes; it is the pretty girl we stopped with her lover, the coy  Marietta.\"    \"Now that they are well off, we may as well set to work,\" said Hunston.    \"Good.\"    Hunston threw back his friar's cowl and produced a key.    \"They have had many a good hunt for this,\" he said, with his old  sinister laugh.    \"I dare say.\"    \"It was a lucky thing that the dainty little Marietta dropped it.\"    \"Yes, it makes matters much easier for us to begin with.\"    The door yielded to the touch of the sham mendicant friar, and the  three worthies entered the grounds.    Silently they stepped across a grassplot, keeping a thick shrubbery  between them and the house as far as they could, when just as they  gained the shelter of a trellissed verandah, a dog within set up a most  alarming noise.    The three robbers exchanged uneasy glances.    \"Curse the beast!\" muttered Mathias the captain; \"he will ruin us.\"    Toro got ready his long hunting-knife and looked about.    But the dog was out of sight.    A lucky thing it was too for our old friend little Mike, for a touch  with that ugly instrument would soon have stopped his singing.    Now, just above the verandah was a half-opened window, and into this  Mathias peered anxiously.    No signs of Mike.    A voice was heard now calling to the faithful guardian of the house to  be silent, but Mike refused emphatically to be comforted; thereupon,  the person very imprudently called the dog to her and tied him up.    This did not quiet him.    So the person in question tripped down the garden to see if there was  really any reason for the dog's singular behaviour.    In passing down the path she went so close to the verandah, that the  skirts of her dress actually brushed aside the creeping plants which  garnished the trellis work.    \"Snarling, barking little beast!\" quoth Marietta to herself, \"and all  about nothing; I wish they would lose him.\"    But when she got to the bottom of the garden and discovered the garden  door open, she altered her tone.    \"How very silly of me to leave the door unlocked,\" she said to herself.  \"Poor little fellow, poor Mike, I'm coming, good dog. Heard someone, I  suppose. Good gracious, what's that? I thought I saw something move  there. I'm getting as nervous as a cat ever since those men stopped us  and made me kiss them, the beasts. Ugh I how I loathe them, although  there was one of them that was really not very bad-looking. I wonder  where that poor old friar went to. What was that? Oh, how nervous I  feel. I wish they had left me some one in the house besides that old  deaf Constantino; he's nice company truly for a girl. Bother the dog,  what a noise he is kicking up.\"    And chatting thus, Marietta re-entered the house.    Meanwhile Mathias had clambered up the iron balcony and pushing open  the glass door, or rather window, he entered the room.    It was the dining-room, and the remnants of a very sumptuous repast  were yet upon the table.    \"I'll just take a glass of wine.\"    He did, too.    He took several glasses of wine, and then, as the fumes of the good  liquor mounted to his brain, he grew generous, and he lowered a bottle  out of the window to his two comrades beneath.    Toro grasped it, and sucked down a good half of it before it left his  lips.    Then Hunston finished it off at a draught.    When Mathias had regaled himself, he made a move to the door.    There was no one about.    Not a sound.    Now was his time.    His object was to explore the house, and ascertain in what particular  part of it the cash, the jewels, and the plate were kept.    When they had secured these, they could content themselves for the  present at least.    Firstly, therefore, he tied up the silver spoons and knives and forks  from the dinner table in a napkin, and dropped the bundle into Toro's  hat below.    Then he crept back through the room into the passage.    This done, he waited for a while to listen, and assuring himself that  the coast was clear, he crept up.    On the next landing there were seven doors.    Six were shut, so he peeped into the seventh room, and just then he  heard a noise below.    Someone coming up stairs.    What could he do?    He stole back to the stairs and listened. It was Marietta.    It was really a most embarrassing job now, for there was no retreat, so  he crept upon tip-toe into the room, of which the door stood ajar.    It was a bedroom, dimly lighted by an oil lamp.    A cursory glance showed him that this room had only been lately  vacated, and that one or more of the ladies had been dressing here for  the ball.    Within a few feet of the door was a looking-glass let into the wall as  a panel, and reaching from floor to ceiling.    Mathias listened in great anxiety for the footsteps on the stairs, and  every moment they sounded nearer and nearer.    \"I hope she will not come in here,\" thought the robber, \"else I shall  have to make her sure.\"    He showed how he meant to \"make her sure\" by toying with the hilt of  his dagger.    Mathias crouched down, and crept under the bed, just in time, as the  pert young lady skipped into the room.    Her first care was to turn up the lamp, and by its light she looked  about her.    \"I think they might have taken me to the ball with them,\" she said,  saucily shaking her curls off her face. \"I should have looked better  than some of them, I'll be bound. I'm dead beat with fatigue. I've had  all the work dressing them, and they are to get all the fun.\"    She was silent for some few minutes, and Mathias grew anxious.    What could be going forward?    He would vastly like to know.    Unable to control his curiosity, he peeped out, and then he saw pretty  Marietta's portrait in the long looking-glass panel.    She looked prettier than ever now, for, shocking to relate, the young  lady was undressing.    Mathias was not to say a bashful man, so he did not draw back.    On the contrary, he stared with all his eyes.    Pretty Marietta little thought, as she stood before the glass, that  such a desperate villain was watching every movement.    Marietta, wholly unconscious that she was watched by the vile brigand  chief, walked up and down before the glass, shooting admiring glances  at herself over her white and well rounded shoulders.    \"Dress, and rank, and money do wonders,\" she said. \"Why are we not all  about equal? I'm as good as the best of them, I'm sure, and very much  better looking.\"    With this mixture of feminine vanity and republican sentiments, she  bustled about, putting the room a bit in order.    Now her first job was to put away several dresses.    The first of these was a short Spanish skirt of pink satin, with deep  black lace flounces.    \"I wonder how I should look in this?\" she murmured.    She held up the dress beside her to test the colour against her  complexion.    \"Beautiful!\"    Beautiful; yes, this was her frank opinion, and, really, we are by no  means sure but that her own estimate was very near the mark.    On went the dress.    She strutted up and down, and then, when she had feasted her eyes  enough upon her own loveliness, she plaited her hair, and, twisting it  up into a rich knot behind, she stuck a high comb into it, and fastened  the thick lace veil about her.    Mathias watched it all.    He gloated over that pretty little picture, and, shameless rascal!  chuckled to think how little she suspected his presence.    \"There,\" she said, folding the veil about her head with the most  coquettish manner, \"if I don't look the prettiest senorita alive, why,  call me--call me anything odious--yes, even an Englishwoman--ha, ha,  ha! How that would please my mistress!\"    And then she figured about before the glass, and capered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#2)"],[1,"a native  sarong.    \"You tell him, Soh Hay, that he must not talk to her,\" the doctor said.  \"If he keeps quiet, he will get well in short time: if he talk, he ill  many days; but I will let him say a few words to her now.\"    The Malay's eyes passed over the group of officers and rested on the  two midshipmen, whose wet clothes showed that they were the officers who  had, as the interpreter had told him, dived in and rescued the child. He  said something to the interpreter.    \"Malay man want to speak to you, young gentlemen,\" the man said; \"he  wish to thank you.\"    \"Oh, tell him there is nothing to thank us for,\" Harry said hastily; \"it  was nothing more than taking a bath.\"    \"Yes, officer, but he wishes to speak to you.\"    Somewhat reluctantly, the two lads approached the side of the injured  man; he took each of them by the hand, and, as he did so, said something  which Soh Hay interpreted:    \"The chief says that you have given him back what he loved best in the  world, and that his life is yours whenever it may be of use to you; he  may be of service to you, gentlemen, should you ever go up the river--a  Malay never forgives an injury or forgets a service.\"    \"Tell him we are very glad to have brought his little girl out of the  water,\" Harry said, \"and that if we ever go up the river, we will pay  him a visit.\"    The chief was now laid in a cot which was swung from the stanchions of  the awning, while the little girl was carried away by the doctor, who  laid her in a berth, gave her a cup of tea, which she drank obediently  to his orders, but evidently regarded as being extremely nasty, and she  was then told through the interpreter to go to sleep until her sarong  was dried. A couple of hours later she was on deck again in her  native garb and ornaments. The interpreter pointed out to her the two  midshipmen who had rescued her, and she at once went up to them, and,  slipping her hands into theirs, began to prattle freely; they were  unable to understand what she said, but they took her round the ship,  showing her the guns, and introduced her to Ponto, the captain's great  Newfoundland, who submitted gravely to be patted by her; to Jacko, the  monkey, who was by no means disposed to be friendly, but chattered and  showed his teeth; and to Julius Caesar, the negro cook, who grinned from  ear to ear, and presented her with some cakes from a batch which he had  just made for the captain's table.    The rest of the Malays had already left the ship; two native boats had  been hailed, and in these the two parties of Malays had taken their  places, and, with their boats towing behind, had been rowed away,  the captain giving strict instructions that they were to be landed on  opposite sides of the river. The little maid speedily became a general  pet on board the Serpent, and was soon the proud possessor of several  models of ships, two patchwork quilts, several carved tobacco boxes,  and other specimens of sailors' handiwork. Small as she was, she had  evidently a strong idea of her own importance, and received these  presents and attentions with a pretty air of dignity which at once  earned for her the title of the Princess.    On the second day after the accident, the chief's boat came off from the  shore, the damage having been speedily and neatly repaired. Little Bahi  stood on the top of the accommodation ladder as they approached, and  addressed them with great asperity, using much gesticulation with her  arms.    \"What is she saying, Soh Hay?\" Dick Balderson asked.    \"She is telling them that they are bad men to let the boat be run down;  that she is very angry with them, and they will all be punished.\"    'The men looked very crestfallen under their little mistress'  reproaches, and held up their hands in a deprecating manner; while  the helmsman stood up and, after salaaming deeply, entered upon a long  explanation, which ended in his asking if he might come on board to  see his chief. Permission was at once granted by the captain, upon the  request being interpreted to him. When he mounted the steps, Bahi led  him to the side of her father's cot. The doctor, however, interposed.    \"Tell him he must not talk,\" he said to the interpreter; \"the chief  is ill and must not be allowed to excite himself. But he can say a few  words, if he wants to.\"    The cot had been lowered to within a few inches of the deck in order  that the chief might watch his daughter as she trotted about and romped  with Ponto, who had now quite taken her into his friendship. The chief's  face expressed alarm when he first saw the great dog; but when he saw  how gentle the animal was, and how, when one of the sailors placed the  child on his back, it walked gravely up and down the deck, wagging its  tail as if pleased with its novel burden, he was satisfied that no harm  could come to her from this formidable looking animal. He had first  spoken a few words sharply to the man in answer to his excuses, and,  indeed, had the helmsman been minding his business instead of looking at  the ship, the collision might have been prevented; but Hassan Jebash was  at the present moment so well contented with the recovery of his child  that he accepted the man's excuses, and the latter went back to his boat  evidently greatly relieved.    In a few days the chief began to show signs of impatience, and through  the interpreter constantly demanded of the doctor when he would be well  enough to leave.    \"You ask him, Soh Hay, whether he wishes to be able to lead his tribe  in battle again, or to go through life unable to use a kris or hurl a  spear. In another ten days, if he remains quiet, he will be able to go,  and in a couple of months will be as strong and active as ever, if he  will but keep quiet until the bones have knit. Surely a chief is not  like an impatient child, ready to risk everything for the sake of  avoiding a little trouble.\"    The chief, on this being translated to him, scowled angrily.    \"Tell him it is of no use his scowling at me, Soh Hay. I am not  doctoring him for my own amusement, but for his good, and because he is  the father of that little child.\"    The chief, when this was translated to him, lay without speaking for two  or three minutes, and then said quietly, \"Tell the doctor I am sorry; he  is right, and I have been foolish. I will stay till he says I may go.\"        CHAPTER II.      Four or five days later the chief was allowed to get up and to walk  quietly up and down the deck, and a week afterwards the doctor said,  \"You can go now, chief, if you desire it; but you must be content  to keep quiet for another couple of months, and not make any great  exertions or move quickly. How long will it take you to go up the river  to your home?\"    \"Six days' easy paddling.\"    \"Well, that is in your favor; but do not travel fast. Take it quietly,  and be as long as you can on the voyage--lying in a canoe is as good a  rest as you can take.\"    \"Thank you, Doctor, I will obey your instructions. You have all been  very kind to me, and a Malay chief never forgets benefits. I have been  hostile to the white men, but now I see I have been mistaken, and that  you are good and kind. Is it true that your boat is going up the river?  Soh Hay tells me that it is so.\"    \"Yes; one of the chiefs, Sehi Pandash, wishes to place himself under our  protection, and he has sent to ask that the ship might go up and fire  her big guns, that the tribes round may see that he has strong friends  who can help him.\"    \"It is two days' rowing up the river to my place from his, and when you  are there I shall come down to see you. Sehi is not a good chief; he  quarrels with his neighbors, and shelters their slaves who run away to  him; he is not a good man.\"    \"Well, we shall all be glad to see you, chief, and I hope that you will  bring your daughter with you. She has won all our hearts, and we shall  miss her sadly.\"    \"I will bring her if I can do so safely,\" the chief said gravely; \"but  I am no friends with Sehi; he stops my trade as it comes down the river,  and takes payment for all goods that pass down. It is because he knows  that many of us are angered that he wishes to put himself under your  protection. I think that you do not do well to aid so bad a fellow.\"    \"We did not know that he was a bad fellow, chief. The best plan will be  for you and the other chiefs who are aggrieved to send down complaints  against him, or to come down yourselves when we are up there and talk  it over with our Captain, who will doubtless impress upon Sehi the  necessity for abstaining from such practices, and that he cannot expect  aid from us if he embroils himself with his neighbors by interfering  with their trade. Is he strong?\"    \"He has many war prahus, which sometimes come down to the sea and return  with plunder, either collected from the cultivators near the coast or  from trading ships captured and burnt.\"    \"I will mention what you tell me to the Captain, and it will prepare  him to listen to any complaint that may be made to him. But you must  remember that he is only acting under the orders of the Governor of the  Straits Settlements, and must refer all important matters to him.\"    \"I will come when you are there,\" Hassan said gravely. \"If nothing is  done, there will be war.\"    There was general regret on board the Serpent when the little princess  said goodby to all her friends and went down the accommodation ladder to  the boat with her father. The chief had said but little to the two young  midshipmen, for he saw that they preferred that the matter should not be  alluded to, but he held their hands at parting, and said:    \"I shall see you again before long; but if at any time you should  want me, I will come, even if your summons reach me in the middle of a  battle.\"    \"It is such nonsense, Doctor,\" Harry said, as the boat pushed off, \"to  have so much made of such a thing as jumping into the water.
