[§ I. ¶ 10,11.]    Q. Is not faith the principle of action in spiritual things as well as  in temporal?    A. It is.    Q. How do you prove it?    A. Heb. 11:6 without faith it is impossible to please God. Mark 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. Rom. 4:16 Therefore  it is of faith that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might  be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to  that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us  all--[§ I. ¶ 12,13.]    Q. Is faith anything else beside the principle of action?    A. It is.    Q. What is it?    A. It is the principle of power also. [§ I. ¶ 13.]    Q. How do you prove it?    A. First, it is the principle of power in the Deity as well as in man.  Heb. 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by  the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things  which do appear.--[§ I. ¶ 14,15,16] Secondly, it is the principle  of power in man also. Book of Mormon, page 264. Alma and Amulek are  delivered from prison. Do. page 421. Nephi and Lehi, with the Lamanites,  are immersed with the Spirit. Do. page 565. The mountain Zerin, by  the faith of the brother of Jared, is removed. Josh. 10:12 Then spake  Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites  before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun,  stand you still upon Gibeon, and you Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.  Josh. 10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the  people had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written  in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven,  and hasted not to go down about a whole day. Mat. 17:19 Then came the  disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? Mat.  17:20. And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief; for verily  I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall  say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall  remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.--Heb. 11:32 And what  shall I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of  Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also, and Samuel, and  of the prophets. Heb 11:34 who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought  righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched  the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness  were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies  of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and  others were tortured, not accepting deliverance: that they might obtain  a better resurrection. [§ I. ¶ 16,17,18,19,20,21,22.]    Q. How would you define faith in its most unlimited sense?    A. It is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion,  and authority over all things. [§ I. ¶ 24.]    Q. How do you convey to the understanding more clearly that faith is  the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and  authority over all things?    A. By it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed,  or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of God; and without it  there is no power, and without power there could be no creation, nor  existence! [§ I. ¶ 24.]        LECTURE SECOND.    Of Faith.    Section II.    1. Having shown in our previous lecture \"faith itself--what it is,\" we  shall proceed to show secondly the object on which it rests.    2. We here observe that God is the only supreme governor and  independent being, in whom all fullness and perfection dwells; who is  omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient; without beginning of days or  end of life; and that in him every good gift and every good principle  dwell; and that he is the Father of lights; In him the principle of  faith dwells independently, and he is the object in whom the faith  of all other rational and accountable beings center, for life and  salvation.    3. In order to present this part of the subject in a clear and  conspicuous point of light, it is necessary to go back and show the  evidences which mankind have had, and the foundation on which these  evidences are, or were based, since the creation, to believe in the  existence of a God.    4. We do not mean those evidences which are manifested by the works of  creation, which we daily behold with our natural eyes: we are sensible  that, after a revelation of Jesus Christ, the works of creation,  throughout their vast forms and varieties, clearly exhibit his eternal  power and Godhead. Romans 1:20. For the invisible things of him from  the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the  things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. But we mean  those evidences by which the first thoughts were suggested to the mind  of men that there was a God who created all things.    5. We shall now proceed to examine the situation of man at his first  creation. Moses, the historian, has given us the following account of  him in the first chap. of the book of Genesis, beginning with the 20th  verse, and closing with the 30th. We copy from the New Translation:    6. And the Lord God said unto the Only Begotten, who was with him from  the beginning, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and it  was done.    7. And the Lord God said, Let them have dominion over the fishes of the  sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all  the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.    8. So God created man in his own image, in the image of the Only  Begotten created he him; male and female created I them. And God  blessed them, and God said unto them Be fruitful, and multiply, and  replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of  the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that  moveth upon the earth.    9. And I, God, said unto man, Behold, I have given you every herb  bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree  in the which shall be the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it  shall be for meat.    10. Again, Genesis 2:15,16,17,19,20: And the Lord God took the man,  and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. And  the Lord God, commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden  you may freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  you shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, nevertheless, you  may choose for yourself, for it is given unto you; but remember that I  forbid it, for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.    11. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field,  and every fowl of the air, and commanded that they should come unto  Adam, to see what he would call them. * * * And whatsoever Adam called  every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names  to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the  field.    12. From the foregoing we learn man's situation at his first creation;  the knowledge with which he was endowed, and the high and exalted  station in which he was placed--lord, or governor of all things on  earth, and at the same time enjoying communion and intercourse with his  Maker, without a vail to separate between. We shall next proceed to  examine the account given of his fall, and of his being driven out of  the garden of Eden, and from the presence of the Lord.    13. Moses proceeds: And they [Adam and Eve] heard the voice of the Lord  God, as they were walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and  Adam and his wife went to hide themselves from the presence of the Lord  God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam,  and said unto him, Where goest you? And he said, I heard your voice in  the garden, and I was afraid, because I beheld that I was naked, and I  hid myself.    14. And the Lord God, said unto Adam, 'Who told you that you were  naked? Have you eaten of the tree whereof I told you you should not  eat? If so, you should surely die?' And the man said, The woman whom  you gave me, and commanded that she should remain with me, gave me of  the fruit of the tree, and I did eat.    15. And I, the Lord God, said unto the woman, What is this thing which  you hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did  eat.    16. And again, the Lord said unto the woman, I will greatly multiply  your sorrow, and your conception. In sorrow you shall bring forth  children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule  over you.    17. And the Lord God said unto Adam, because you have hearkened unto  the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the fruit of the tree of  which I commanded yous, saying, You shall not eat of it! cursed shall  be the ground for your sake; in sorrow you shall eat of it all the  days of your life. Thorns also, and thistles shall it bring forth to  you: and you shall eat the herb of the field. By the sweat of your  face shall you eat bread, until you shall return unto the ground--for  you shall surely die--for out of it you were taken: for dust you were,  and unto dust you shall return. This was immediately followed by the  fulfillment of what we previously said: Man was driven, or sent out of  Eden.    18. Two important items are shown from the former quotations:  First, after man was created, he was not left without intelligence,  or understanding, to wander in darkness and spend an existence in  ignorance and doubt--on the great and important point which effected  his happiness,--as to the real fact by whom he was created, or unto  whom he was amenable for his conduct. God conversed with him face to  face: in his presence he was permitted to stand, and from his own mouth  he was permitted to receive instruction--he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#2)"],[1,"es. The word \"do\"  is to be understood as including forbearances as well as acts. They  must be capable of fulfilling the conditions of action and the  conditions of self-restraint, which are necessary either for keeping  the established polity in existence, or for enabling it to achieve the  ends, its conduciveness to which forms its recommendation.    The failure of any of these conditions renders a form of government,  whatever favorable promise it may otherwise hold out, unsuitable to  the particular case.    The first obstacle, the repugnance of the people to the particular  form of government, needs little illustration, because it never can in  theory have been overlooked. The case is of perpetual occurrence.  Nothing but foreign force would induce a tribe of North American  Indians to submit to the restraints of a regular and civilized  government. The same might have been said, though somewhat less  absolutely, of the barbarians who overran the Roman Empire. It  required centuries of time, and an entire change of circumstances, to  discipline them into regular obedience even to their own leaders, when  not actually serving under their banner. There are nations who will  not voluntarily submit to any government but that of certain families,  which have from time immemorial had the privilege of supplying them  with chiefs. Some nations could not, except by foreign conquest, be  made to endure a monarchy; others are equally averse to a republic.  The hindrance often amounts, for the time being, to impracticability.    But there are also cases in which, though not averse to a form of  government--possibly even desiring it--a people may be unwilling or  unable to fulfill its conditions. They may be incapable of fulfilling  such of them as are necessary to keep the government even in nominal  existence. Thus a people may prefer a free government; but if, from  indolence, or carelessness, or cowardice, or want of public spirit,  they are unequal to the exertions necessary for preserving it; if they  will not fight for it when it is directly attacked; if they can be  deluded by the artifices used to cheat them out of it; if, by  momentary discouragement, or temporary panic, or a fit of enthusiasm  for an individual, they can be induced to lay their liberties at the  feet even of a great man, or trust him with powers which enable him to  subvert their institutions--in all these cases they are more or less  unfit for liberty; and though it may be for their good to have had it  even for a short time, they are unlikely long to enjoy it. Again, a  people may be unwilling or unable to fulfill the duties which a  particular form of government requires of them. A rude people, though  in some degree alive to the benefits of civilized society, may be  unable to practice the forbearances which it demands; their passions  may be too violent, or their personal pride too exacting, to forego  private conflict, and leave to the laws the avenging of their real or  supposed wrongs. In such a case, a civilized government, to be really  advantageous to them, will require to be in a considerable degree  despotic; one over which they do not themselves exercise control, and  which imposes a great amount of forcible restraint upon their actions.  Again, a people must be considered unfit for more than a limited and  qualified freedom who will not co-operate actively with the law and  the public authorities in the repression of evil-doers. A people who  are more disposed to shelter a criminal than to apprehend him; who,  like the Hindoos, will perjure themselves to screen the man who has  robbed them, rather than take trouble or expose themselves to  vindictiveness by giving evidence against him; who, like some nations  of Europe down to a recent date, if a man poniards another in the  public street, pass by on the other side, because it is the business  of the police to look to the matter, and it is safer not to interfere  in what does not concern them; a people who are revolted by an  execution, but not shocked at an assassination--require that the  public authorities should be armed with much sterner powers of  repression than elsewhere, since the first indispensable requisites of  civilized life have nothing else to rest on. These deplorable states  of feeling, in any people who have emerged from savage life, are, no  doubt, usually the consequence of previous bad government, which has  taught them to regard the law as made for other ends than their good,  and its administrators as worse enemies than those who openly violate  it. But, however little blame may be due to those in whom these mental  habits have grown up, and however the habits may be ultimately  conquerable by better government, yet, while they exist, a people so  disposed can not be governed with as little power exercised over them  as a people whose sympathies are on the side of the law, and who are  willing to give active assistance in its enforcement. Again,  representative institutions are of little value, and may be a mere  instrument of tyranny or intrigue, when the generality of electors are  not sufficiently interested in their own government to give their  vote, or, if they vote at all, do not bestow their suffrages on public  grounds, but sell them for money, or vote at the beck of some one who  has control over them, or whom for private reasons they desire to  propitiate. Popular election thus practiced, instead of a security  against misgovernment, is but an additional wheel in its machinery.    Besides these moral hindrances, mechanical difficulties are often an  insuperable impediment to forms of government. In the ancient world,  though there might be, and often was, great individual or local  independence, there could be nothing like a regulated popular  government beyond the bounds of a single city-community; because there  did not exist the physical conditions for the formation and  propagation of a public opinion, except among those who could be  brought together to discuss public matters in the same agora. This  obstacle is generally thought to have ceased by the adoption of the  representative system. But to surmount it completely, required the  press, and even the newspaper press, the real equivalent, though not  in all respects an adequate one, of the Pnyx and the Forum. There have  been states of society in which even a monarchy of any great  territorial extent could not subsist, but unavoidably broke up into  petty principalities, either mutually independent, or held together by  a loose tie like the feudal: because the machinery of authority was  not perfect enough to carry orders into effect at a great distance  from the person of the ruler. He depended mainly upon voluntary  fidelity for the obedience even of his army, nor did there exist the  means of making the people pay an amount of taxes sufficient for  keeping up the force necessary to compel obedience throughout a large  territory. In these and all similar cases, it must be understood that  the amount of the hindrance may be either greater or less. It may be  so great as to make the form of government work very ill, without  absolutely precluding its existence, or hindering it from being  practically preferable to any other which can be had. This last  question mainly depends upon a consideration which we have not yet  arrived at--the tendencies of different forms of government to promote  Progress.    We have now examined the three fundamental conditions of the  adaptation of forms of government to the people who are to be governed  by them. If the supporters of what may be termed the naturalistic  theory of politics, mean but to insist on the necessity of these three  conditions; if they only mean that no government can permanently exist  which does not fulfill the first and second conditions, and, in some  considerable measure, the third; their doctrine, thus limited, is  incontestable. Whatever they mean more than this appears to me  untenable. All that we are told about the necessity of an historical  basis for institutions, of their being in harmony with the national  usages and character, and the like, means either this, or nothing to  the purpose. There is a great quantity of mere sentimentality  connected with these and similar phrases, over and above the amount of  rational meaning contained in them. But, considered practically, these  alleged requisites of political institutions are merely so many  facilities for realising the three conditions. When an institution, or  a set of institutions, has the way prepared for it by the opinions,  tastes, and habits of the people, they are not only more easily  induced to accept it, but will more easily learn, and will be, from  the beginning, better disposed, to do what is required of them both  for the preservation of the institutions, and for bringing them into  such action as enables them to produce their best results. It would be  a great mistake in any legislator not to shape his measures so as to  take advantage of such pre-existing habits and feelings when  available. On the other hand, it is an exaggeration to elevate these  mere aids and facilities into necessary conditions. People are more  easily induced to do, and do more easily, what they are already used  to; but people also learn to do things new to them. Familiarity is a  great help; but much dwelling on an idea will make it familiar, even  when strange at first. There are abundant instances in which a whole  people have been eager for untried things. The amount of capacity  which a people possess for doing new things, and adapting themselves  to new circumstances; is itself one of the elements of the question.  It is a quality in which different nations, and different stages of  civilization, differ much from one another. The capability of any  given people for fulfilling the conditions of a given form of  government can not be pronounced on by any sweeping rule. "]]]
