I had  put that up, too, and it was one of the best effects I ever invented.  When it was finished I stood up on the platform and extended my  hands abroad, for two minutes, with my face uplifted--that always  produces a dead hush--and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word  with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble, and  many women to faint:    \"Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft!\"    Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word, I touched  off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of  people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare!  It was immense  --that effect!  Lots of people shrieked, women curled up and quit  in every direction, foundlings collapsed by platoons.  The abbot  and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered  with agitated prayers.  Merlin held his grip, but he was astonished  clear down to his corns; he had never seen anything to begin  with that, before.  Now was the time to pile in the effects.  I lifted  my hands and groaned out this word--as it were in agony:    \"Nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen!\"    --and turned on the red fire!  You should have heard that Atlantic  of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue!  After sixty seconds I shouted:    \"Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen-  tragoedie!\"    --and lit up the green fire!  After waiting only forty seconds this  time, I spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating  syllables of this word of words:    \"Mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher!\"    --and whirled on the purple glare!  There they were, all going  at once, red, blue, green, purple!--four furious volcanoes pouring  vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft, and spreading a blinding  rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley.  In  the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid  against the background of sky, his seesaw stopped for the first  time in twenty years.  I knew the boys were at the pump now and  ready.  So I said to the abbot:    \"The time is come, Father.  I am about to pronounce the dread name  and command the spell to dissolve.  You want to brace up, and take  hold of something.\"  Then I shouted to the people: \"Behold, in  another minute the spell will be broken, or no mortal can break it.  If it break, all will know it, for you will see the sacred water  gush from the chapel door!\"    I stood a few moments, to let the hearers have a chance to spread  my announcement to those who couldn't hear, and so convey it  to the furthest ranks, then I made a grand exhibition of extra  posturing and gesturing, and shouted:    \"Lo, I command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain  to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still  remain in him, and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence  to the pit, there to lie bound a thousand years.  By his own dread  name I command it--BGWJJILLIGKKK!\"    Then I touched off the hogshead of rockets, and a vast fountain of  dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a  hissing rush, and burst in mid-sky into a storm of flashing jewels!  One mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people  --then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy--for there, fair  and plain in the uncanny glare, they saw the freed water leaping  forth!  The old abbot could not speak a word, for tears and the  chokings in his throat; without utterance of any sort, he folded me  in his arms and mashed me.  It was more eloquent than speech.  And harder to get over, too, in a country where there were really  no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel.    You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down  in that water and kiss it; kiss it, and pet it, and fondle it, and  talk to it as if it were alive, and welcome it back with the dear  names they gave their darlings, just as if it had been a friend who  was long gone away and lost, and was come home again.  Yes, it was  pretty to see, and made me think more of them than I had done before.    I sent Merlin home on a shutter.  He had caved in and gone down  like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name, and had  never come to since.  He never had heard that name before,--neither  had I--but to him it was the right one.  Any jumble would have  been the right one.  He admitted, afterward, that that spirit's own  mother could not have pronounced that name better than I did.  He never could understand how I survived it, and I didn't tell  him.  It is only young magicians that give away a secret like that.  Merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out  the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it.  But he didn't arrive.    When I started to the chapel, the populace uncovered and fell back  reverently to make a wide way for me, as if I had been some kind  of a superior being--and I was.  I was aware of that.  I took along  a night shift of monks, and taught them the mystery of the pump,  and set them to work, for it was plain that a good part of the  people out there were going to sit up with the water all night,  consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted  of it.  To those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle  itself, and they were full of wonder over it; and of admiration,  too, of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance.    It was a great night, an immense night.  There was reputation in it.  I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it.        CHAPTER XXIV    A RIVAL MAGICIAN    My influence in the Valley of Holiness was something prodigious  now.  It seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable  account.  The thought came to me the next morning, and was suggested  by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come  riding in.  According to history, the monks of this place two  centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash.  It might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still  remaining.  So I sounded a Brother:    \"Wouldn't you like a bath?\"    He shuddered at the thought--the thought of the peril of it to  the well--but he said with feeling:    \"One needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that  blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy.  Would God I might  wash me! but it may not be, fair sir, tempt me not; it is forbidden.\"    And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved  he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed,  if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile.  So I  went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother.  He  blenched at the idea--I don't mean that you could see him blench,  for of course you couldn't see it without you scraped him, and  I didn't care enough about it to scrape him, but I knew the blench  was there, just the same, and within a book-cover's thickness of  the surface, too--blenched, and trembled.  He said:    \"Ah, son, ask aught else thou wilt, and it is thine, and freely  granted out of a grateful heart--but this, oh, this!  Would you  drive away the blessed water again?\"    \"No, Father, I will not drive it away.  I have mysterious knowledge  which teaches me that there was an error that other time when  it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain.\"  A large interest began to show up in the old man's face.  \"My  knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune,  which was caused by quite another sort of sin.\"    \"These are brave words--but--but right welcome, if they be true.\"    \"They are true, indeed.  Let me build the bath again, Father.  Let me build it again, and the fountain shall flow forever.\"    \"You promise this?--you promise it?  Say the word--say you promise it!\"    \"I do promise it.\"    \"Then will I have the first bath myself!  Go--get ye to your work.  Tarry not, tarry not, but go.\"    I and my boys were at work, straight off.  The ruins of the old  bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery, not a stone  missing.  They had been left just so, all these lifetimes, and  avoided with a pious fear, as things accursed.  In two days we  had it all done and the water in--a spacious pool of clear pure  water that a body could swim in.  It was running water, too.  It came in, and went out, through the ancient pipes.  The old abbot  kept his word, and was the first to try it.  He went down black  and shaky, leaving the whole black community above troubled and  worried and full of bodings; but he came back white and joyful,  and the game was made! another triumph scored.    It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness,  and I was very well satisfied, and ready to move on now, but  I struck a disappointment.  I caught a heavy cold, and it started  up an old lurking rheumatism of mine.  Of course the rheumatism  hunted up my weakest place and located itself there.  This was  the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me, what  time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace.    When at last I got out, I was a shadow.  But everybody was full  of attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into  my life, and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly  up toward health and strength again; so I gained fast.    Sandy was worn out with nursing; so I made up my mind to turn out  and go a cruise alone, leaving her at the nunnery to rest up.  My idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree  and wander through the country a week or two on foot.  This would  give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest  class of free citizens on equal terms.  There was no other way  to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7247"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 6. (#2)"],[1,"it had  been five hundred years away instead of two or three days.\"    \"How amazing that it should be so!\"    \"Yes, a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five  hundred years away easier than he can a thing that's only five  hundred seconds off.\"    \"And yet in reason it should clearly be the other way; it should  be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first,  for, indeed, it is so close by that one uninspired might almost  see it.  In truth, the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods,  most strangely making the difficult easy, and the easy difficult.\"    It was a wise head.  A peasant's cap was no safe disguise for it;  you could know it for a king's under a diving-bell, if you could  hear it work its intellect.    I had a new trade now, and plenty of business in it.  The king  was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen  during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live  in them.  From that time out, I prophesied myself bald-headed  trying to supply the demand.  I have done some indiscreet things in  my day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the  worst.  Still, it had its ameliorations.  A prophet doesn't have  to have any brains.  They are good to have, of course, for the  ordinary exigencies of life, but they are no use in professional  work.  It is the restfulest vocation there is.  When the spirit of  prophecy comes upon you, you merely cake your intellect and lay it  off in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it  alone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy.    Every day a knight-errant or so came along, and the sight of them  fired the king's martial spirit every time.  He would have forgotten  himself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspicious  shade or so above his ostensible degree, and so I always got him  well out of the road in time.  Then he would stand and look with  all his eyes; and a proud light would flash from them, and his  nostrils would inflate like a war-horse's, and I knew he was  longing for a brush with them.  But about noon of the third day  I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been  suggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two days  before; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken,  I was so loath to institute it; but now I had just had a fresh  reminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw spread and  intellect at rest, for I was prophesying, I stubbed my toe and  fell sprawling.  I was so pale I couldn't think for a moment;  then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack.  I had that dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool in a box.  It was  a good thing to have along; the time would come when I could do  a valuable miracle with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thing  to have about me, and I didn't like to ask the king to carry it.  Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get  along with its society.  I got it out and slipped it into my scrip,  and just then here came a couple of knights.  The king stood,  stately as a statue, gazing toward them--had forgotten himself again,  of course--and before I could get a word of warning out, it was  time for him to skip, and well that he did it, too.  He supposed  they would turn aside.  Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt  under foot?  When had he ever turned aside himself--or ever had  the chance to do it, if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight  in time to judiciously save him the trouble?  The knights paid  no attention to the king at all; it was his place to look out  himself, and if he hadn't skipped he would have been placidly  ridden down, and laughed at besides.    The king was in a flaming fury, and launched out his challenge  and epithets with a most royal vigor.  The knights were some little  distance by now.  They halted, greatly surprised, and turned in  their saddles and looked back, as if wondering if it might be worth  while to bother with such scum as we.  Then they wheeled and  started for us.  Not a moment must be lost.  I started for _them_.  I passed them at a rattling gait, and as I went by I flung out a  hair-lifting soul-scorching thirteen-jointed insult which made  the king's effort poor and cheap by comparison.  I got it out of  the nineteenth century where they know how.  They had such headway  that they were nearly to the king before they could check up;  then, frantic with rage, they stood up their horses on their hind  hoofs and whirled them around, and the next moment here they came,  breast to breast.  I was seventy yards off, then, and scrambling up  a great bowlder at the roadside.  When they were within thirty  yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level, depressed  their mailed heads, and so, with their horse-hair plumes streaming  straight out behind, most gallant to see, this lightning express  came tearing for me!  When they were within fifteen yards, I sent  that bomb with a sure aim, and it struck the ground just under  the horses' noses.    Yes, it was a neat thing, very neat and pretty to see.  It resembled  a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi; and during the next  fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic  fragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh.  I say we,  for the king joined the audience, of course, as soon as he had got  his breath again.  There was a hole there which would afford steady  work for all the people in that region for some years to come  --in trying to explain it, I mean; as for filling it up, that service  would be comparatively prompt, and would fall to the lot of a  select few--peasants of that seignory; and they wouldn't get  anything for it, either.    But I explained it to the king myself. I said it was done with a  dynamite bomb.  This information did him no damage, because it  left him as intelligent as he was before.  However, it was a noble  miracle, in his eyes, and was another settler for Merlin.  I thought  it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort  that it couldn't be done except when the atmospheric conditions  were just right.  Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we  had a good subject, and that would be inconvenient, because I  hadn't any more bombs along.        CHAPTER XXVIII    DRILLING THE KING    On the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and we  had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, I came to a resolution:  the king _must_ be drilled; things could not go on so, he must be  taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled, or we  couldn't ever venture to enter a dwelling; the very cats would know  this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant.  So I called a halt  and said:    \"Sire, as between clothes and countenance, you are all right, there  is no discrepancy; but as between your clothes and your bearing,  you are all wrong, there is a most noticeable discrepancy.  Your  soldierly stride, your lordly port--these will not do.  You stand  too straight, your looks are too high, too confident.  The cares  of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders, they do not droop the chin,  they do not depress the high level of the eye-glance, they do not  put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them  in slouching body and unsure step.  It is the sordid cares of  the lowly born that do these things.  You must learn the trick;  you must imitate the trademarks of poverty, misery, oppression,  insult, and the other several and common inhumanities that sap  the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and  approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters, or the very  infants will know you for better than your disguise, and we shall go  to pieces at the first hut we stop at.  Pray try to walk like this.\"    The king took careful note, and then tried an imitation.    \"Pretty fair--pretty fair.  Chin a little lower, please--there, very  good.  Eyes too high; pray don't look at the horizon, look at the  ground, ten steps in front of you.  Ah--that is better, that is  very good.  Wait, please; you betray too much vigor, too much  decision; you want more of a shamble.  Look at me, please--this is  what I mean....  Now you are getting it; that is the idea--at least,  it sort of approaches it....  Yes, that is pretty fair.  _But!_  There is a great big something wanting, I don't quite know what  it is.  Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get a perspective  on the thing....  Now, then--your head's right, speed's right,  shoulders right, eyes right, chin right, gait, carriage, general  style right--everything's right!  And yet the fact remains, the  aggregate's wrong.  The account don't balance.  Do it again,  please....  _Now_ I think I begin to see what it is.  Yes, I've  struck it.  You see, the genuine spiritlessness is wanting; that's  what's the trouble.  It's all _amateur_--mechanical details all  right, almost to a hair; everything about the delusion perfect,  except that it don't delude.\"    \"What, then, must one do, to prevail?\"    \"Let me think... I can't seem to quite get at it.  In fact, there  isn't anything that can right the matter but practice.  This is  a good place for it: roots and stony ground to break up your  stately gait, a region not liable to interruption, only one field  and one hut in sight, and they so far away that nobody could  see us from there.  It will be well to move a little off the road  and put in the whole day drilling you, sire.\"    After the drill had gone on a little while, I said:    \"Now, sire, imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder,  and the family are before us.  Proceed, please--accost the head  of the house.\"    The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument, and said,  with frozen austerity:    \"Varlet, bring a seat; and serve to me what cheer ye have.\"    \"Ah, your grace, that is not well done.\"    \"In what lacketh it?\"    \"Th"]]]
