Nobody ever did smile at Clowes' essays in  wit, perhaps because of the solemn, almost sad, tone of voice in which  he delivered them. He was tall and dark and thin, and had a pensive  eye, which encouraged the more soulful of his female relatives to  entertain hopes that he would some day take orders.    \"Well,\" said Paget, relieved at finding that he did not stand alone in  his views on Rand-Brown's performance, \"I must say I thought he was  awfully bad myself.\"    \"I shall try somebody else next match,\" said Trevor. \"It'll be rather  hard, though. The man one would naturally put in, Bryce, left at  Christmas, worse luck.\"    Bryce was the other wing three-quarter of the second fifteen.    \"Isn't there anybody in the third?\" asked Paget.    \"Barry,\" said Clowes briefly.    \"Clowes thinks Barry's good,\" explained Trevor.    \"He _is_ good,\" said Clowes. \"I admit he's small, but he can  tackle.\"    \"The question is, would he be any good in the first? A chap might do  jolly well for the third, and still not be worth trying for the first.\"    \"I don't remember much about Barry,\" said Paget, \"except being collared  by him when we played Seymour's last year in the final. I certainly  came away with a sort of impression that he could tackle. I thought he  marked me jolly well.\"    \"There you are, then,\" said Clowes. \"A year ago Barry could tackle  Paget. There's no reason for supposing that he's fallen off since then.  We've seen that Rand-Brown _can't_ tackle Paget. Ergo, Barry is  better worth playing for the team than Rand-Brown. Q.E.D.\"    \"All right, then,\" replied Trevor. \"There can't be any harm in trying  him. We'll have another scratch game on Thursday. Will you be here  then, Paget?\"    \"Oh, yes. I'm stopping till Saturday.\"    \"Good man. Then we shall be able to see how he does against you. I wish  you hadn't left, though, by Jove. We should have had Ripton on toast,  the same as last term.\"    Wrykyn played five schools, but six school matches. The school that  they played twice in the season was Ripton. To win one Ripton match  meant that, however many losses it might have sustained in the other  matches, the school had had, at any rate, a passable season. To win two  Ripton matches in the same year was almost unheard of. This year there  had seemed every likelihood of it. The match before Christmas on the  Ripton ground had resulted in a win for Wrykyn by two goals and a try  to a try. But the calculations of the school had been upset by the  sudden departure of Paget at the end of term, and also of Bryce, who  had hitherto been regarded as his understudy. And in the first Ripton  match the two goals had both been scored by Paget, and both had been  brilliant bits of individual play, which a lesser man could not have  carried through.    The conclusion, therefore, at which the school reluctantly arrived, was  that their chances of winning the second match could not be judged by  their previous success. They would have to approach the Easter term  fixture from another--a non-Paget--standpoint. In these circumstances  it became a serious problem: who was to get the fifteenth place?  Whoever played in Paget's stead against Ripton would be certain, if the  match were won, to receive his colours. Who, then, would fill the  vacancy?    \"Rand-Brown, of course,\" said the crowd.    But the experts, as we have shown, were of a different opinion.          II    THE GOLD BAT      Trevor did not take long to resume a garb of civilisation. He never  wasted much time over anything. He was gifted with a boundless energy,  which might possibly have made him unpopular had he not justified it by  results. The football of the school had never been in such a  flourishing condition as it had attained to on his succeeding to the  captaincy. It was not only that the first fifteen was good. The  excellence of a first fifteen does not always depend on the captain.  But the games, even down to the very humblest junior game, had woken up  one morning--at the beginning of the previous term--to find themselves,  much to their surprise, organised going concerns. Like the immortal  Captain Pott, Trevor was \"a terror to the shirker and the lubber\". And  the resemblance was further increased by the fact that he was \"a  toughish lot\", who was \"little, but steel and india-rubber\". At first  sight his appearance was not imposing. Paterfamilias, who had heard his  son's eulogies on Trevor's performances during the holidays, and came  down to watch the school play a match, was generally rather  disappointed on seeing five feet six where he had looked for at least  six foot one, and ten stone where he had expected thirteen. But then,  what there was of Trevor was, as previously remarked, steel and  india-rubber, and he certainly played football like a miniature  Stoddart. It was characteristic of him that, though this was the  first match of the term, his condition seemed to be as good as  possible. He had done all his own work on the field and most of  Rand-Brown's, and apparently had not turned a hair. He was one of  those conscientious people who train in the holidays.    When he had changed, he went down the passage to Clowes' study. Clowes was  in the position he frequently took up when the weather was good--wedged  into his window in a sitting position, one leg in the study, the other  hanging outside over space. The indoor leg lacked a boot, so that it was  evident that its owner had at least had the energy to begin to change.  That he had given the thing up after that, exhausted with the effort, was  what one naturally expected from Clowes. He would have made a splendid  actor: he was so good at resting.    \"Hurry up and dress,\" said Trevor; \"I want you to come over to the  baths.\"    \"What on earth do you want over at the baths?\"    \"I want to see O'Hara.\"    \"Oh, yes, I remember. Dexter's are camping out there, aren't they? I  heard they were. Why is it?\"    \"One of the Dexter kids got measles in the last week of the holidays,  so they shunted all the beds and things across, and the chaps went back  there instead of to the house.\"    In the winter term the baths were always boarded over and converted  into a sort of extra gymnasium where you could go and box or fence when  there was no room to do it in the real gymnasium. Socker and stump-cricket  were also largely played there, the floor being admirably suited to such  games, though the light was always rather tricky, and prevented heavy  scoring.    \"I should think,\" said Clowes, \"from what I've seen of Dexter's  beauties, that Dexter would like them to camp out at the bottom of the  baths all the year round. It would be a happy release for him if they  were all drowned. And I suppose if he had to choose any one of them for  a violent death, he'd pick O'Hara. O'Hara must be a boon to a  house-master. I've known chaps break rules when the spirit moved  them, but he's the only one I've met who breaks them all day long  and well into the night simply for amusement. I've often thought of  writing to the S.P.C.A. about it. I suppose you could call Dexter an  animal all right?\"    \"O'Hara's right enough, really. A man like Dexter would make any fellow  run amuck. And then O'Hara's an Irishman to start with, which makes a  difference.\"    There is usually one house in every school of the black sheep sort,  and, if you go to the root of the matter, you will generally find that  the fault is with the master of that house. A house-master who enters  into the life of his house, coaches them in games--if an athlete--or,  if not an athlete, watches the games, umpiring at cricket and  refereeing at football, never finds much difficulty in keeping order.  It may be accepted as fact that the juniors of a house will never be  orderly of their own free will, but disturbances in the junior day-room  do not make the house undisciplined. The prefects are the criterion.  If you find them joining in the general \"rags\", and even starting  private ones on their own account, then you may safely say that it is  time the master of that house retired from the business, and took to  chicken-farming. And that was the state of things in Dexter's. It was  the most lawless of the houses. Mr Dexter belonged to a type of master  almost unknown at a public school--the usher type. In a private school  he might have passed. At Wrykyn he was out of place. To him the whole  duty of a house-master appeared to be to wage war against his house.    When Dexter's won the final for the cricket cup in the summer term of  two years back, the match lasted four afternoons--four solid afternoons  of glorious, up-and-down cricket. Mr Dexter did not see a single ball of  that match bowled. He was prowling in sequestered lanes and broken-down  barns out of bounds on the off-chance that he might catch some member of  his house smoking there. As if the whole of the house, from the head to  the smallest fag, were not on the field watching Day's best bats collapse  before Henderson's bowling, and Moriarty hit up that marvellous and  unexpected fifty-three at the end of the second innings!    That sort of thing definitely stamps a master.    \"What do you want to see O'Hara about?\" asked Clowes.    \"He's got my little gold bat. I lent it him in the holidays.\"    A remark which needs a footnote. The bat referred to was made of gold,  and was about an inch long by an eighth broad. It had come into  existence some ten years previously, in the following manner. The  inter-house cricket cup at Wrykyn had originally been a rather  tarnished and unimpressive vessel, whose only merit consisted in the  fact that it was of silver. Ten years ago an Old Wrykinian, suddenly  reflecting that it would not be a bad idea to do something for the  school in a small way, hied him to the nearest jeweller's and purchased  another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#2)"],[1," the present Captains F. F. Powell, and Richard Ethersey, in the  Schooner 'Royal Tiger' and 'Shannon,' assisted by Lieut. (now Commander)  Felix Jones, and the late Lieut. Wilmot Christopher, who fell in action  before Mooltan. The first of these officers had charge of one of the  tenders under Lieut. Powell, and the latter another under Lieut. Ethersey.  The maps of the Pamban Pass and the Straits of Manaar were by the hand of  Lieut. Felix Jones, who was the draftsman also on this survey: they speak  for themselves.\" [4]    In 1838 Sir Charles Malcolm was succeeded by Sir Robert Oliver, an \"old  officer of the old school\"--a strict disciplinarian, a faithful and honest  servant of Government, but a violent, limited, and prejudiced man. He  wanted \"sailors,\" individuals conversant with ropes and rigging, and  steeped in knowledge of shot and shakings, he loved the \"rule of thumb,\"  he hated \"literary razors,\" and he viewed science with the profoundest  contempt. About twenty surveys were ordered to be discontinued as an  inauguratory measure, causing the loss of many thousand pounds,  independent of such contingencies as the \"Memnon.\" [5] Batta was withheld  from the few officers who obtained leave, and the life of weary labour on  board ship was systematically made monotonous and uncomfortable:--in local  phrase it was described as \"many stripes and no stars.\" Few measures were  omitted to heighten the shock of contrast. No notice was taken of papers  forwarded to Government, and the man who attempted to distinguish himself  by higher views than quarter-deck duties, found himself marked out for the  angry Commodore's red-hot displeasure. No place was allowed for charts and  plans: valuable original surveys, of which no duplicates existed, lay  tossed amongst the brick and mortar with which the Marine Office was being  rebuilt. No instruments were provided for ships, even a barometer was not  supplied in one case, although duly indented for during five years. Whilst  Sir Charles Malcolm ruled the Bombay dockyards, the British name rose high  in the Indian, African, and Arabian seas. Each vessel had its presents--  guns, pistols, and powder, Abbas, crimson cloth and shawls, watches,  telescopes, and similar articles--with a suitable stock of which every  officer visiting the interior on leave was supplied. An order from Sir  Robert Oliver withdrew presents as well as instruments: with them  disappeared the just idea of our faith and greatness as a nation  entertained by the maritime races, who formerly looked forward to the  arrival of our cruizers. Thus the Indian navy was crushed by neglect and  routine into a mere transport service, remarkable for little beyond  constant quarrels between sea-lieutenants and land-lieutenants, sailor-  officers and soldier-officers, their \"passengers.\" And thus resulted that  dearth of enterprise--alluded to _ex cathedra_ by a late President of the  Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain--which now characterises  Western India erst so celebrated for ardour in adventure.    To return to the subject of East African discovery. Commodore Lushington  and Dr. Carter met in order to concert some measures for forwarding the  plans of a Somali Expedition. It was resolved to associate three persons,  Drs. Carter and Stocks, and an officer of the Indian navy: a vessel was  also warned for service on the coast of Africa. This took place in the  beginning of 1851: presently Commodore Lushington resigned his command,  and the project fell to the ground.    The author of these pages, after his return from El Hajaz to Bombay,  conceived the idea of reviving the Somali Expedition: he proposed to start  in the spring of 1854, and accompanied by two officers, to penetrate _via_  Harar and Gananah to Zanzibar. His plans were favourably received by the  Right Hon. Lord Elphinstone, the enlightened governor of the colony, and  by the local authorities, amongst whom the name of James Grant Lumsden,  then Member of Council, will ever suggest the liveliest feelings of  gratitude and affection. But it being judged necessary to refer once more  for permission to the Court of Directors, an official letter bearing date  the 28th April 1854 was forwarded from Bombay with a warm recommendation.  Lieut. Herne of the 1st Bombay European Regiment of Fusileers, an officer  skilful in surveying, photography, and mechanics, together with the  writer, obtained leave, pending the reference, and a free passage to Aden  in Arabia. On the 23rd August a favourable reply was despatched by the  Court of Directors.    Meanwhile the most painful of events had modified the original plan. The  third member of the Expedition, Assistant Surgeon J. Ellerton Stocks,  whose brilliant attainments as a botanist, whose long and enterprising  journeys, and whose eminently practical bent of mind had twice recommended  him for the honors and trials of African exploration, died suddenly in the  prime of life. Deeply did his friends lament him for many reasons: a  universal favourite, he left in the social circle a void never to be  filled up, and they mourned the more that Fate had not granted him the  time, as it had given him the will and the power, to trace a deeper and  more enduring mark upon the iron tablets of Fame.    No longer hoping to carry out his first project, the writer determined to  make the geography and commerce of the Somali country his principal  objects. He therefore applied to the Bombay Government for the assistance  of Lieut. William Stroyan, I. N., an officer distinguished by his surveys  on the coast of Western India, in Sindh, and on the Panjab Rivers. It was  not without difficulty that such valuable services were spared for the  deadly purpose of penetrating into Eastern Africa. All obstacles, however,  were removed by their ceaseless and energetic efforts, who had fostered  the author's plans, and early in the autumn of 1854, Lieut. Stroyan  received leave to join the Expedition. At the same time, Lieut. J. H.  Speke, of the 46th Regiment Bengal N. I., who had spent many years  collecting the Fauna of Thibet and the Himalayan mountains, volunteered to  share the hardships of African exploration.    In October 1854, the writer and his companions received at Aden in Arabia  the sanction of the Court of Directors. It was his intention to march in a  body, using Berberah as a base of operations, westwards to Harar, and  thence in a south-easterly direction towards Zanzibar.    But the voice of society at Aden was loud against the expedition. The  rough manners, the fierce looks, and the insolent threats of the Somal--  the effects of our too peaceful rule--had pre-possessed the timid colony  at the \"Eye of Yemen\" with an idea of extreme danger. The Anglo-Saxon  spirit suffers, it has been observed, from confinement within any but  wooden walls, and the European degenerates rapidly, as do his bull-dogs,  his game-cocks, and other pugnacious animals, in the hot, enervating, and  unhealthy climates of the East. The writer and his comrades were  represented to be men deliberately going to their death, and the Somal at  Aden were not slow in imitating the example of their rulers. The savages  had heard of the costly Shoa Mission, its 300 camels and 50 mules, and  they longed for another rehearsal of the drama: according to them a vast  outlay was absolutely necessary, every village must be feasted, every  chief propitiated with magnificent presents, and dollars must be dealt out  by handfuls. The Political Resident refused to countenance the scheme  proposed, and his objection necessitated a further change of plans.    Accordingly, Lieut. Herne was directed to proceed, after the opening of  the annual fair-season, to Berberah, where no danger was apprehended. It  was judged that the residence of this officer upon the coast would produce  a friendly feeling on the part of the Somal, and, as indeed afterwards  proved to be the case, would facilitate the writer's egress from Harar, by  terrifying the ruler for the fate of his caravans. [6] Lieut. Herne, who  on the 1st of January 1855, was joined by Lieut. Stroyan, resided on the  African coast from November to April; he inquired into the commerce, the  caravan lines, and the state of the slave trade, visited the maritime  mountains, sketched all the places of interest, and made a variety of  meteorological and other observations as a prelude to extensive research.    Lieut. Speke was directed to land at Bunder Guray, a small harbour in the  \"Arz el Aman,\" or \"Land of Safety,\" as the windward Somal style their  country. His aim was to trace the celebrated Wady Nogal, noting its  watershed and other peculiarities, to purchase horses and camels for the  future use of the Expedition, and to collect specimens of the reddish  earth which, according to the older African travellers, denotes the  presence of gold dust. [7] Lieut. Speke started on the 23rd October 1854,  and returned, after about three months, to Aden. He had failed, through  the rapacity and treachery of his guide, to reach the Wady Nogal. But he  had penetrated beyond the maritime chain of hills, and his journal  (condensed in the Appendix) proves that he had collected some novel and  important information.    Meanwhile the author, assuming the disguise of an Arab merchant, prepared  to visit the forbidden city of Harar. He left Aden on the 29th of October  1854, arrived at the capital of the ancient Hadiyah Empire on the 3rd  January 1855, and on the 9th of the ensuing February returned in safety to  Arabia, with the view of purchasing stores and provisions for a second and  a longer journey. [8] What unforeseen circumstance cut short the career of  the proposed Expedition, the Postscript of the present volume will show.    The following pages contain the writer's diary, kept daring his march to  and from Harar. It must be borne in mind that the region traversed on this  occasion was previously"]]]
