After recovering from a  severe typhus fever, a fever sore affected his leg and threatened him  with the loss of the limb. Under these circumstances, a consultation  of physicians was held, and after making an incision eight inches  in length, and examining the bone, they decided that, if his life  was to be saved, amputation of the member was absolutely necessary.  This operation, however, was so strongly opposed by both parents and  son that the doctors finally concluded to remove the affected parts  of the bone. Accordingly, they called for a strong cord to bind the  lad, and were intending to give him a stimulant; but to all this our  young hero most decidedly objected, saying, \"I will not touch one  particle of liquor, neither will I be tied down; but I will have my  father sit on the bed and hold me in his arms, and then I will do  whatever is necessary to have the bone taken out.\" By drilling into  the bone on each side of the part affected, three pieces of bone  were extracted, the removal being made with a pair of forceps. The  manhood and willpower of this noble youth of eight years, under so  trying an ordeal, foreshadowed the story of his life--a life fraught  with matchless heroism, under all manner of persecution, trials,  imprisonments, hardships and finally martyrdom. The howlings of  murderous mobs, infuriated by infernal legions, the lying slanders of a  vile hireling priesthood, and the base treachery of loathsome traitors,  proved utterly powerless to cause him to swerve a single hair's  breadth from the cause of God and the interests of the downtrodden  and oppressed. To the transgressor and hypocrite he was a fierce lion  in the way, to injured innocence he was a tower of strength, and to  the poor and helpless he was ever a brother and a friend. He lived a  hero of heroes, and a Prophet of Prophets, and to save his brethren  from harm and bloodshed, he dauntlessly went to his death, and died  a Martyr of Martyrs. The world, in its wickedness and crime, may  treat his memory with derision and scorn; but when his defamers are  forgotten, the great and mighty Prophet of God who, under the name of  Joseph Smith, laid down his life for truth and his brethren, shall be  fondly enshrined in the heart of the universe and his life and actions  approved and applauded by the loving lips of eternity.    It has been truly said that \"God moves in a mysterious way\" in order  to perform His wonders, and the Scriptures lead us to believe that He  often leads us by a \"way that we know not of.\" Seldom, or never, were  these expressions more fully verified than in the removal of the future  Prophet's father from Vermont and his settling in Palmyra in New York  state. Little did the good man dream of the fact, as he wended his  way from his former home, that he was being led by the Lord to the  very place where his son's great work was to be accomplished. Yet such  was certainly the fact. Every step of his journey was guided by the  controlling power and wisdom of God, and, although he knew it not, he  settled just where God wanted him and where He wanted his son, who was  to be like Joseph of old, the saviour of his father's house.    When between the ages of fourteen and fifteen, after earnestly calling  upon God, Joseph had his first vision, as set forth in another chapter.  When he was between seventeen and eighteen years old, he had his second  vision, which is likewise elsewhere described. And when he was between  twenty-one and twenty-two, after having been instructed by a heavenly  messenger for four years, in the year 1827 the golden records were  entrusted to the custody of the youthful Prophet. He had been married  just eight months and four days at this time. In the year 1827, by the  aid of the Urim and Thummim, or interpreters, the history of two lost  nations was translated, the one being the nation of the Jaredites and  the other that of the Nephites. The remnants of the latter of these  nations of the Nephites were the wild Indians of America, who were  first discovered by Columbus in the year 1492.    On the sixth day of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints was organized. And on the twenty-seventh day of June,  1844, the Prophet sealed his testimony with his blood. Joseph Smith  was murdered in Carthage Jail when he was in the prime of his life,  being only thirty-eight years, six months and six days old. It was just  fourteen years, two months and twenty-one days after the Church was  organized. Strange as it may appear, our Lord and Saviour was murdered  when only a few years younger than Joseph, and both were put to death  for the same cause, namely, the establishing of the Church of Christ on  the earth, the one in the former and the one in the latter days.    Dark and solemn was that day when Illinois shed the innocent blood of  the two martyrs, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. They were at the time under  the protection of Governor Thomas Ford, who pledged his sacred honor  for their safety. But the pledge, which was never meant to be kept, was  most shamefully broken, and these two heroic spirits were given up to  a professed Christian mob of merciless demons, and they were cruelly  murdered in cold blood. These great and good men, servants of the Most  High God, of \"whom the world was not worthy,\" were of one heart and one  mind throughout all their life, and in death they were not separated.  They fled together from the murderous mob to their destined home on  high. There, while they bask in the sunshine of eternal peace and love,  they testify by their blood to the horrid cruelties that reign in the  heart of a wicked and apostate world.    There were but four years, ten months and fourteen days between the  ages of these noble martyred brothers, Hyrum being the elder.    Joseph, on this occasion, voluntarily gave himself up to the strong arm  of the law, for he had ever been willing to be tried by the tribunals  of his country. At this time, our beloved Prophet was impressed with a  sad foreboding somewhat similar to that experienced in Gethsemane by  the Saviour just previous to the crucifixion, when he called upon the  Father and said: \"Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:  nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.\" The Prophet Joseph said,  while on his way to Carthage, \"I am going like a lamb to the slaughter;  but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of  offence towards God and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it  shall yet be said of me, 'he was murdered in cold blood.'\" Elder Bates  Nobles, now living, authorizes me to say that he heard the Prophet  utter those very words. Well, this prophecy of our murdered Prophet  has been often fulfilled in the testimonies of the Saints, both among  themselves and before the world, as well as by the utterances of the  honorable and upright men of all lands, but to its bitter cost, it has  not yet been said by our nation. However, we will watch and wait. \"God  is just is all we say.\"     \"Our Patriarch and Prophet, too, Were massacred. They bled, To seal   their testimony, They were numbered with the dead.\"    CHAPTER II.    The Hill Cumorah, where the Plates of the Book of Mormon were Concealed  by Moroni and afterwards Delivered by him to Joseph Smith.--Some  Valuable History Pertaining to this Thrice-named Hill.    A beautiful picture of the Hill Cumorah is presented on the opposite  page. The hill is situated in the northwestern part of New York, about  thirty miles south of Rochester. It is also near the New York Central  Railroad, and only three and a half miles from Palmyra station to the  south, and on the Canandaigua turnpike.    This noted hill has been three times named and by three distinct and  great nations. For particulars concerning its historical importance  we begin our study in the year 1823. At that time there was found in  the side of this historic hill, by an obscure boy, a number of gold  plates. These plates were very ingeniously concealed in a stone box  and, bearing a record and being now translated, supply us with all the  earlier information contained on them.    There is a vast amount of valuable history pertaining to this hill,  which is far more picturesque than the hills which surround it. There  is an extensive valley on the east, as well as one on the west side  of the hill, where the turnpike runs south, passing through the town  of Manchester in the rear of the hill about two miles. Manchester, as  well as the Hill Cumorah, is situated in the township of Manchester.  The most prominent view of the hill is its north front. It extends  south nearly a mile, where it terminates into a more level plateau,  which is occupied as an agricultural district. From the highest point  of the hill, which is the northern end, where the writer has stood a  number of times, is one of the most lovely sights imaginable. To the  east is the New York Central Railroad, about four miles north is a most  lovely town named Palmyra, and two miles northwest is where the father  of Joseph Smith located a farm when the latter was only twelve years  of age. Finally, the whole country surrounding the hill from the most  elevated spot, as far as the natural vision can grasp, is indeed a most  charming scene of farms, orchards, houses, barns and rolling hills,  with occasional forests, and in the proper season, fields of golden  grain, barns well-filled, orchard trees laden with apples, peaches  and pears, with here and there patches of strawberries, raspberries,  blackberries, cherries, currants and garden vegetables in variety. All  of these beautiful scenes have engraven upon my mind a picture which  defies the artist's brush to place on canvas.

He was as handsome and inscrutable as those daydreams we once  planned to marry ourselves, Diana; he was the best dressed man I ever  met, and he raved over Priscilla's 'ethereal, golden beauty.'  But of  course there are no cannibals in Japan.\"    \"Your wedding dress is a dream, anyhow,\" sighed Diana rapturously.  \"You'll look like a perfect queen in it--you're so tall and slender.  How DO you keep so slim, Anne?  I'm fatter than ever--I'll soon have no  waist at all.\"    \"Stoutness and slimness seem to be matters of predestination,\" said  Anne.  \"At all events, Mrs. Harmon Andrews can't say to you what she  said to me when I came home from Summerside, 'Well, Anne, you're just  about as skinny as ever.'  It sounds quite romantic to be 'slender,'  but 'skinny' has a very different tang.\"    \"Mrs. Harmon has been talking about your trousseau.  She admits it's as  nice as Jane's, although she says Jane married a millionaire and you  are only marrying a 'poor young doctor without a cent to his name.'\"    Anne laughed.    \"My dresses ARE nice.  I love pretty things.  I remember the first  pretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our  school concert.  Before that everything I had was so ugly.  It seemed  to me that I stepped into a new world that night.\"    \"That was the night Gilbert recited 'Bingen on the Rhine,' and looked  at you when he said, 'There's another, NOT a sister.'  And you were so  furious because he put your pink tissue rose in his breast pocket!  You  didn't much imagine then that you would ever marry him.\"    \"Oh, well, that's another instance of predestination,\" laughed Anne, as  they went down the garret stairs.        CHAPTER 2    THE HOUSE OF DREAMS    There was more excitement in the air of Green Gables than there had  ever been before in all its history.  Even Marilla was so excited that  she couldn't help showing it--which was little short of being  phenomenal.    \"There's never been a wedding in this house,\" she said, half  apologetically, to Mrs. Rachel Lynde.  \"When I was a child I heard an  old minister say that a house was not a real home until it had been  consecrated by a birth, a wedding and a death.  We've had deaths  here--my father and mother died here as well as Matthew; and we've even  had a birth here.  Long ago, just after we moved into this house, we  had a married hired man for a little while, and his wife had a baby  here.  But there's never been a wedding before.  It does seem so  strange to think of Anne being married.  In a way she just seems to me  the little girl Matthew brought home here fourteen years ago.  I can't  realize that she's grown up.  I shall never forget what I felt when I  saw Matthew bringing in a GIRL.  I wonder what became of the boy we  would have got if there hadn't been a mistake.  I wonder what HIS fate  was.\"    \"Well, it was a fortunate mistake,\" said Mrs. Rachel Lynde, \"though,  mind you, there was a time I didn't think so--that evening I came up to  see Anne and she treated us to such a scene.  Many things have changed  since then, that's what.\"    Mrs. Rachel sighed, and then brisked up again.  When weddings were in  order Mrs. Rachel was ready to let the dead past bury its dead.    \"I'm going to give Anne two of my cotton warp spreads,\" she resumed.  \"A tobacco-stripe one and an apple-leaf one.  She tells me they're  getting to be real fashionable again.  Well, fashion or no fashion, I  don't believe there's anything prettier for a spare-room bed than a  nice apple-leaf spread, that's what.  I must see about getting them  bleached.  I've had them sewed up in cotton bags ever since Thomas  died, and no doubt they're an awful color.  But there's a month yet,  and dew-bleaching will work wonders.\"    Only a month!  Marilla sighed and then said proudly:    \"I'm giving Anne that half dozen braided rugs I have in the garret. I  never supposed she'd want them--they're so old-fashioned, and nobody  seems to want anything but hooked mats now.  But she asked me for  them--said she'd rather have them than anything else for her floors.  They ARE pretty.  I made them of the nicest rags, and braided them in  stripes.  It was such company these last few winters.  And I'll make  her enough blue plum preserve to stock her jam closet for a year.  It  seems real strange.  Those blue plum trees hadn't even a blossom for  three years, and I thought they might as well be cut down.  And this  last spring they were white, and such a crop of plums I never remember  at Green Gables.\"    \"Well, thank goodness that Anne and Gilbert really are going to be  married after all.  It's what I've always prayed for,\" said Mrs.  Rachel, in the tone of one who is comfortably sure that her prayers  have availed much.  \"It was a great relief to find out that she really  didn't mean to take the Kingsport man.  He was rich, to be sure, and  Gilbert is poor--at least, to begin with; but then he's an Island boy.\"    \"He's Gilbert Blythe,\" said Marilla contentedly.  Marilla would have  died the death before she would have put into words the thought that  was always in the background of her mind whenever she had looked at  Gilbert from his childhood up--the thought that, had it not been for  her own wilful pride long, long ago, he might have been HER son.  Marilla felt that, in some strange way, his marriage with Anne would  put right that old mistake.  Good had come out of the evil of the  ancient bitterness.    As for Anne herself, she was so happy that she almost felt frightened.  The gods, so says the old superstition, do not like to behold too happy  mortals.  It is certain, at least, that some human beings do not.  Two  of that ilk descended upon Anne one violet dusk and proceeded to do  what in them lay to prick the rainbow bubble of her satisfaction.  If  she thought she was getting any particular prize in young Dr. Blythe,  or if she imagined that he was still as infatuated with her as he might  have been in his salad days, it was surely their duty to put the matter  before her in another light.  Yet these two worthy ladies were not  enemies of Anne; on the contrary, they were really quite fond of her,  and would have defended her as their own young had anyone else attacked  her.  Human nature is not obliged to be consistent.    Mrs. Inglis--nee Jane Andrews, to quote from the Daily Enterprise--came  with her mother and Mrs. Jasper Bell.  But in Jane the milk of human  kindness had not been curdled by years of matrimonial bickerings.  Her  lines had fallen in pleasant places.  In spite of the fact--as Mrs.  Rachel Lynde would say--that she had married a millionaire, her  marriage had been happy.  Wealth had not spoiled her.  She was still  the placid, amiable, pink-cheeked Jane of the old quartette,  sympathising with her old chum's happiness and as keenly interested in  all the dainty details of Anne's trousseau as if it could rival her own  silken and bejewelled splendors.  Jane was not brilliant, and had  probably never made a remark worth listening to in her life; but she  never said anything that would hurt anyone's feelings--which may be a  negative talent but is likewise a rare and enviable one.    \"So Gilbert didn't go back on you after all,\" said Mrs. Harmon Andrews,  contriving to convey an expression of surprise in her tone.  \"Well, the  Blythes generally keep their word when they've once passed it, no  matter what happens.  Let me see--you're twenty-five, aren't you, Anne?  When I was a girl twenty-five was the first corner.  But you look quite  young.  Red-headed people always do.\"    \"Red hair is very fashionable now,\" said Anne, trying to smile, but  speaking rather coldly.  Life had developed in her a sense of humor  which helped her over many difficulties; but as yet nothing had availed  to steel her against a reference to her hair.    \"So it is--so it is,\" conceded Mrs. Harmon.  \"There's no telling what  queer freaks fashion will take.  Well, Anne, your things are very  pretty, and very suitable to your position in life, aren't they, Jane?  I hope you'll be very happy.  You have my best wishes, I'm sure.  A  long engagement doesn't often turn out well.  But, of course, in your  case it couldn't be helped.\"    \"Gilbert looks very young for a doctor.  I'm afraid people won't have  much confidence in him,\" said Mrs. Jasper Bell gloomily.  Then she shut  her mouth tightly, as if she had said what she considered it her duty  to say and held her conscience clear.  She belonged to the type which  always has a stringy black feather in its hat and straggling locks of  hair on its neck.    Anne's surface pleasure in her pretty bridal things was temporarily  shadowed; but the deeps of happiness below could not thus be disturbed;  and the little stings of Mesdames Bell and Andrews were forgotten when  Gilbert came later, and they wandered down to the birches of the brook,  which had been saplings when Anne had come to Green Gables, but were  now tall, ivory columns in a fairy palace of twilight and stars.  In  their shadows Anne and Gilbert talked in lover-fashion of their new  home and their new life together.    \"I've found a nest for us, Anne.\"    \"Oh, where?  Not right in the village, I hope.  I wouldn't like that  altogether.\"    \"No.  There was no house to be had in the village.  This is a little  white house on the harbor shore, half way between Glen St. Mary and  Four Winds Point.  It's a little out of the way, but when we get a  'phone in that won't matter so much.  The situation is beautiful.  It  looks to the sunset and has the great blue harbor before it.  The  sand-dunes aren't very far away--the sea winds blow over them and the  sea spray drenches them.\"    \"But the house itself, Gilbert,--OUR first home?  What is it like?\"    \"Not very large, but large enough for us.  There's a splendid living  room with a fireplace in it downstairs, and a dining room that looks  out on the harbor, and a little room that will do for"]]]
