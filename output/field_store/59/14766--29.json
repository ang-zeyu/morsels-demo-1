Danger is nothing to me; for  life, while this hateful mark makes me the object of your horror and  disgust,--life is a burden which I would fling down with joy. Either  remove this dreadful hand, or take my wretched life! You have deep  science. All the world bears witness of it. You have achieved great  wonders. Cannot you remove this little, little mark, which I cover with  the tips of two small fingers? Is this beyond your power, for the sake  of your own peace, and to save your poor wife from madness?\"    \"Noblest, dearest, tenderest wife,\" cried Aylmer, rapturously, \"doubt  not my power. I have already given this matter the deepest  thought--thought which might almost have enlightened me to create a  being less perfect than yourself. Georgiana, you have led me deeper  than ever into the heart of science. I feel myself fully competent to  render this dear cheek as faultless as its fellow; and then, most  beloved, what will be my triumph when I shall have corrected what  Nature left imperfect in her fairest work! Even Pygmalion, when his  sculptured woman assumed life, felt not greater ecstasy than mine will  be.\"    \"It is resolved, then,\" said Georgiana, faintly smiling. \"And, Aylmer,  spare me not, though you should find the birthmark take refuge in my  heart at last.\"    Her husband tenderly kissed her cheek--her right cheek--not that which  bore the impress of the crimson hand.    The next day Aylmer apprised his wife of a plan that he had formed  whereby he might have opportunity for the intense thought and constant  watchfulness which the proposed operation would require; while  Georgiana, likewise, would enjoy the perfect repose essential to its  success. They were to seclude themselves in the extensive apartments  occupied by Aylmer as a laboratory, and where, during his toilsome  youth, he had made discoveries in the elemental powers of Nature that  had roused the admiration of all the learned societies in Europe.  Seated calmly in this laboratory, the pale philosopher had investigated  the secrets of the highest cloud region and of the profoundest mines;  he had satisfied himself of the causes that kindled and kept alive the  fires of the volcano; and had explained the mystery of fountains, and  how it is that they gush forth, some so bright and pure, and others  with such rich medicinal virtues, from the dark bosom of the earth.  Here, too, at an earlier period, he had studied the wonders of the  human frame, and attempted to fathom the very process by which Nature  assimilates all her precious influences from earth and air, and from  the spiritual world, to create and foster man, her masterpiece. The  latter pursuit, however, Aylmer had long laid aside in unwilling  recognition of the truth--against which all seekers sooner or later  stumble--that our great creative Mother, while she amuses us with  apparently working in the broadest sunshine, is yet severely careful to  keep her own secrets, and, in spite of her pretended openness, shows us  nothing but results. She permits us, indeed, to mar, but seldom to  mend, and, like a jealous patentee, on no account to make. Now,  however, Aylmer resumed these half-forgotten investigations; not, of  course, with such hopes or wishes as first suggested them; but because  they involved much physiological truth and lay in the path of his  proposed scheme for the treatment of Georgiana.    As he led her over the threshold of the laboratory, Georgiana was cold  and tremulous. Aylmer looked cheerfully into her face, with intent to  reassure her, but was so startled with the intense glow of the  birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a  strong convulsive shudder. His wife fainted.    \"Aminadab! Aminadab!\" shouted Aylmer, stamping violently on the floor.    Forthwith there issued from an inner apartment a man of low stature,  but bulky frame, with shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was  grimed with the vapors of the furnace. This personage had been Aylmer's  underworker during his whole scientific career, and was admirably  fitted for that office by his great mechanical readiness, and the skill  with which, while incapable of comprehending a single principle, he  executed all the details of his master's experiments. With his vast  strength, his shaggy hair, his smoky aspect, and the indescribable  earthiness that incrusted him, he seemed to represent man's physical  nature; while Aylmer's slender figure, and pale, intellectual face,  were no less apt a type of the spiritual element.    \"Throw open the door of the boudoir, Aminadab,\" said Aylmer, \"and burn  a pastil.\"    \"Yes, master,\" answered Aminadab, looking intently at the lifeless form  of Georgiana; and then he muttered to himself, \"If she were my wife,  I'd never part with that birthmark.\"    When Georgiana recovered consciousness she found herself breathing an  atmosphere of penetrating fragrance, the gentle potency of which had  recalled her from her deathlike faintness. The scene around her looked  like enchantment. Aylmer had converted those smoky, dingy, sombre  rooms, where he had spent his brightest years in recondite pursuits,  into a series of beautiful apartments not unfit to be the secluded  abode of a lovely woman. The walls were hung with gorgeous curtains,  which imparted the combination of grandeur and grace that no other  species of adornment can achieve; and as they fell from the ceiling to  the floor, their rich and ponderous folds, concealing all angles and  straight lines, appeared to shut in the scene from infinite space. For  aught Georgiana knew, it might be a pavilion among the clouds. And  Aylmer, excluding the sunshine, which would have interfered with his  chemical processes, had supplied its place with perfumed lamps,  emitting flames of various hue, but all uniting in a soft, impurpled  radiance. He now knelt by his wife's side, watching her earnestly, but  without alarm; for he was confident in his science, and felt that he  could draw a magic circle round her within which no evil might intrude.    \"Where am I? Ah, I remember,\" said Georgiana, faintly; and she placed  her hand over her cheek to hide the terrible mark from her husband's  eyes.    \"Fear not, dearest!\" exclaimed he. \"Do not shrink from me! Believe me,  Georgiana, I even rejoice in this single imperfection, since it will be  such a rapture to remove it.\"    \"Oh, spare me!\" sadly replied his wife. \"Pray do not look at it again.  I never can forget that convulsive shudder.\"    In order to soothe Georgiana, and, as it were, to release her mind from  the burden of actual things, Aylmer now put in practice some of the  light and playful secrets which science had taught him among its  profounder lore. Airy figures, absolutely bodiless ideas, and forms of  unsubstantial beauty came and danced before her, imprinting their  momentary footsteps on beams of light. Though she had some indistinct  idea of the method of these optical phenomena, still the illusion was  almost perfect enough to warrant the belief that her husband possessed  sway over the spiritual world. Then again, when she felt a wish to look  forth from her seclusion, immediately, as if her thoughts were  answered, the procession of external existence flitted across a screen.  The scenery and the figures of actual life were perfectly represented,  but with that bewitching, yet indescribable difference which always  makes a picture, an image, or a shadow so much more attractive than the  original. When wearied of this, Aylmer bade her cast her eyes upon a  vessel containing a quantity of earth. She did so, with little interest  at first; but was soon startled to perceive the germ of a plant  shooting upward from the soil. Then came the slender stalk; the leaves  gradually unfolded themselves; and amid them was a perfect and lovely  flower.    \"It is magical!\" cried Georgiana. \"I dare not touch it.\"    \"Nay, pluck it,\" answered Aylmer,--\"pluck it, and inhale its brief  perfume while you may. The flower will wither in a few moments and  leave nothing save its brown seed vessels; but thence may be  perpetuated a race as ephemeral as itself.\"    But Georgiana had no sooner touched the flower than the whole plant  suffered a blight, its leaves turning coal-black as if by the agency of  fire.    \"There was too powerful a stimulus,\" said Aylmer, thoughtfully.    To make up for this abortive experiment, he proposed to take her  portrait by a scientific process of his own invention. It was to be  effected by rays of light striking upon a polished plate of metal.  Georgiana assented; but, on looking at the result, was affrighted to  find the features of the portrait blurred and indefinable; while the  minute figure of a hand appeared where the cheek should have been.  Aylmer snatched the metallic plate and threw it into a jar of corrosive  acid.    Soon, however, he forgot these mortifying failures. In the intervals of  study and chemical experiment he came to her flushed and exhausted, but  seemed invigorated by her presence, and spoke in glowing language of  the resources of his art. He gave a history of the long dynasty of the  alchemists, who spent so many ages in quest of the universal solvent by  which the golden principle might be elicited from all things vile and  base. Aylmer appeared to believe that, by the plainest scientific  logic, it was altogether within the limits of possibility to discover  this long-sought medium; \"but,\" he added, \"a philosopher who should go  deep enough to acquire the power would attain too lofty a wisdom to  stoop to the exercise of it.\" Not less singular were his opinions in  regard to the elixir vitae. He more than intimated that it was at his  option to concoct a liquid that should prolong life for years, perhaps  interminably; but that it would produce a discord in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51233"],[0,"The Marching Morons (#2)"],[1,"by other methods. To  bring subjects out of Levantman shock, you let them have a squirt of  simple saline in the trigeminal nerve. Interesting. And now about that  bronze--    He heaved the pick into the rotting green salts, expecting no  resistence and almost fractured his wrist. _Something_ down there was  _solid_. He began to flake off the oxides.    A half hour of work brought him down to phosphor bronze, a huge casting  of the almost incorruptible metal. It had weakened structurally over  the centuries; he could fit the point of his pick under a corroded boss  and pry off great creaking and grumbling striae of the stuff.    Hawkins wished he had an archeologist with him, but didn't dream of  returning to his shop and calling one to take over the find. He was an  all-around man: by choice and in his free time, an artist in clay and  glaze; by necessity, an automotive, electronics and atomic engineer  who could also swing a project in traffic control, individual and  group psychology, architecture or tool design. He didn't yell for a  specialist every time something out of his line came up; there were so  few with so much to do....    He trenched around his find, discovering that it was a great  brick-shaped bronze mass with an excitingly hollow sound. A long strip  of moldering metal from one of the long vertical faces pulled away,  exposing red rust that went _whoosh_ and was sucked into the interior  of the mass.    It had been de-aired, thought Hawkins, and there must have been an  inner jacket of glass which had crystalized through the centuries and  quietly crumbled at the first clang of his pick. He didn't know what a  vacuum would do to a subject of Levantman shock, but he had hopes, nor  did he quite understand what a real estate dealer was, but it might  have something to do with pottery. And _anything_ might have a bearing  on Topic Number One.           *       *       *       *       *    He flung his pick out of the trench, climbed out and set off at a  dog-trot for his shop. A little rummaging turned up a hypo and there  was a plasticontainer of salt in the kitchen.    Back at his dig, he chipped for another half hour to expose the  juncture of lid and body. The hinges were hopeless; he smashed them off.    Hawkins extended the telescopic handle of the pick for the best  leverage, fitted its point into a deep pit, set its built-in fulcrum,  and heaved. Five more heaves and he could see, inside the vault, what  looked like a dusty marble statue. Ten more and he could see that it  was the naked body of Honest John Barlow, Evanston real estate dealer,  uncorrupted by time.    The potter found the apex of the trigeminal nerve with his needle's  point and gave him 60 cc.    In an hour Barlow's chest began to pump.    In another hour, he rasped, \"Did it work?\"    \"_Did_ it!\" muttered Hawkins.    Barlow opened his eyes and stirred, looked down, turned his hands  before his eyes--    \"I'll sue!\" he screamed. \"My clothes! My fingernails!\" A horrid  suspicion came over his face and he clapped his hands to his hairless  scalp. \"My hair!\" he wailed. \"I'll sue you for every penny you've got!  That release won't mean a damned thing in court--I didn't sign away my  hair and clothes and fingernails!\"    \"They'll grow back,\" said Hawkins casually. \"Also your epidermis. Those  parts of you weren't alive, you know, so they weren't preserved like  the rest of you. I'm afraid the clothes are gone, though.\"    \"What is this--the University hospital?\" demanded Barlow. \"I want  a phone. No, you phone. Tell my wife I'm all right and tell Sam  Immerman--he's my lawyer--to get over here right away. Greenleaf  7-4022. Ow!\" He had tried to sit up, and a portion of his pink skin  rubbed against the inner surface of the casket, which was powdered by  the ancient crystalized glass. \"What the hell did you guys do, boil me  alive? Oh, you're going to pay for this!\"    \"You're all right,\" said Hawkins, wishing now he had a reference book  to clear up several obscure terms. \"Your epidermis will start growing  immediately. You're not in the hospital. Look here.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He handed Barlow the stainless steel plate that had labeled the casket.  After a suspicious glance, the man started to read. Finishing, he laid  the plate carefully on the edge of the vault and was silent for a  spell.    \"Poor Verna,\" he said at last. \"It doesn't say whether she was stuck  with the court costs. Do you happen to know--\"    \"No,\" said the potter. \"All I know is what was on the plate, and how to  revive you. The dentist accidentally gave you a dose of what we call  Levantman shock anesthesia. We haven't used it for centuries; it was  powerful, but too dangerous.\"    \"Centuries ...\" brooded the man. \"Centuries ... I'll bet Sam swindled  her out of her eyeteeth. Poor Verna. How long ago was it? What year is  this?\"    Hawkins shrugged. \"We call it 7-B-936. That's no help to you. It takes  a long time for these metals to oxidize.\"    \"Like that movie,\" Barlow muttered. \"Who would have thought it? Poor  Verna!\" He blubbered and sniffled, reminding Hawkins powerfully of the  fact that he had been found under a flat rock.    Almost angrily, the potter demanded, \"How many children did you have?\"    \"None yet,\" sniffed Barlow. \"My first wife didn't want them. But Verna  wants one--wanted one--but we're going to wait until--we _were_ going  to wait until--\"    \"Of course,\" said the potter, feeling a savage desire to tell him off,  blast him to hell and gone for his work. But he choked it down. There  was The Problem to think of; there was always The Problem to think of,  and this poor blubberer might unexpectedly supply a clue. Hawkins would  have to pass him on.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Come along,\" Hawkins said. \"My time is short.\"    Barlow looked up, outraged. \"How can you be so unfeeling? I'm a human  being like--\"    The Los Angeles-Chicago \"rocket\" thundered overhead and Barlow broke  off in mid-complaint. \"Beautiful!\" he breathed, following it with his  eyes. \"Beautiful!\"    He climbed out of the vault, too interested to be pained by its  roughness against his infantile skin. \"After all,\" he said briskly,  \"this should have its sunny side. I never was much for reading, but  this is just like one of those stories. And I ought to make some money  out of it, shouldn't I?\" He gave Hawkins a shrewd glance.    \"You want money?\" asked the potter. \"Here.\" He handed over a fistful  of change and bills. \"You'd better put my shoes on. It'll be about a  quarter-mile. Oh, and you're--uh, modest?--yes, that was the word.  Here.\" Hawkins gave him his pants, but Barlow was excitedly counting  the money.    \"Eighty-five, eighty-six--and it's dollars, too! I thought it'd  be credits or whatever they call them. 'E Pluribus Unum' and  'Liberty'--just different faces. Say, is there a catch to this? Are  these real, genuine, honest twenty-two-cent dollars like we had or  just wallpaper?\"    \"They're quite all right, I assure you,\" said the potter. \"I wish you'd  come along. I'm in a hurry.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The man babbled as they stumped toward the shop. \"Where are we  going--The Council of Scientists, the World Coordinator or something  like that?\"    \"Who? Oh, no. We call them 'President' and 'Congress.' No, that  wouldn't do any good at all. I'm just taking you to see some people.\"    \"I ought to make plenty out of this. _Plenty!_ I could write books.  Get some smart young fellow to put it into words for me and I'll bet I  could turn out a best-seller. What's the setup on things like that?\"    \"It's about like that. Smart young fellows. But there aren't any  best-sellers any more. People don't read much nowadays. We'll find  something equally profitable for you to do.\"    Back in the shop, Hawkins gave Barlow a suit of clothes, deposited him  in the waiting room and called Central in Chicago. \"Take him away,\" he  pleaded. \"I have time for one more firing and he blathers and blathers.  I haven't told him anything. Perhaps we should just turn him loose and  let him find his own level, but there's a chance--\"    \"The Problem,\" agreed Central. \"Yes, there's a chance.\"    The potter delighted Barlow by making him a cup of coffee with a cube  that not only dissolved in cold water but heated the water to boiling  point. Killing time, Hawkins chatted about the \"rocket\" Barlow had  admired, and had to haul himself up short; he had almost told the real  estate man what its top speed really was--almost, indeed, revealed that  it was not a rocket.    He regretted, too, that he had so casually handed Barlow a couple of  hundred dollars. The man seemed obsessed with fear that they were  worthless since Hawkins refused to take a note or I.O.U. or even a  definite promise of repayment. But Hawkins couldn't go into details,  and was very glad when a stranger arrived from Central.    \"Tinny-Peete, from Algeciras,\" the stranger told him swiftly as the  two of them met at the door. \"Psychist for Poprob. Polasigned special  overtake Barlow.\"    \"Thank Heaven,\" said Hawkins. \"Barlow,\" he told the man from the past,  \"this is Tinny-Peete. He's going to take care of you and help you make  lots of money.\"    The psychist stayed for a cup of the coffee whose preparation had  delighted Barlow, and then conducted the real estate man down the  corduroy road to his car, leaving the potter to speculate on whether he  could at last crack his kilns.    Hawkins, abruptly dismissing Barlow and the Problem, happily picked  the chinking from around the door of the number two kiln, prying it  open a trifle. A blast of heat and the heady, smoky scent of the  reduction fire delighted him. He peered and saw a corner of a shelf  glowing cherry-red, becoming obscured by wavering black areas as it  lost heat through the opened door. He slipped a charred wood paddle  under a mug on the shelf and pulled it out as a"]]]
