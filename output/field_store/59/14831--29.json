I felt my presence to  be unwelcome, but:    \"Very well,\" he began, suddenly. \"I expect, Mr. Harley, that you will be  disposed to regard what I have to tell you rather as a symptom of what  you call nerves than as evidence of any agency directed against me.\"    Paul Harley stared curiously at the speaker. \"Do I understand you to  suspect that someone is desirous of harming you?\" he enquired.    Colonel Menendez slowly nodded his head.    \"Such is my meaning,\" he replied.    \"You refer to bodily harm?\"    \"But yes, emphatically.\"    \"Hm,\" said Harley; and taking out a tin of tobacco from a cabinet beside  him he began in leisurely manner to load a briar. \"No doubt you have  good reasons for this suspicion?\"    \"If I had not good reasons, Mr. Harley, nothing could have induced me to  trouble you. Yet, even now that I have compelled myself to come here, I  find it difficult, almost impossible, to explain those reasons to you.\"    An expression of embarrassment appeared upon the brown face, and now  Colonel Menendez paused and was plainly at a loss for words with which  to continue.    Harley replaced the tin in the cupboard and struck a match. Lighting his  pipe he nodded good humouredly as if to say, \"I quite understand.\" As a  matter of fact, he probably thought, as I did, that this was a familiar  case of a man of possibly blameless life who had become subject to  that delusion which leads people to believe themselves threatened by  mysterious and unnameable danger.    Our visitor inhaled deeply.    \"You, of course, are waiting for the facts,\" he presently resumed,  speaking with a slowness which told of a mind labouring for the right  mode of expression. \"These are so scanty, I fear, of so, shall I say,  phantom a kind, that even when they are in your possession you will  consider me to be merely the victim of a delusion. In the first place,  then, I have reason to believe that someone followed me from my home to  your office.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Paul Harley, sympathetically, for this I perceived  was exactly what he had anticipated, and merely tended to confirm his  suspicion. \"Some member of your household?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Did you actually see this follower?\"    \"My dear sir,\" cried Colonel Menendez, excitement emphasizing his  accent, \"if I had seen him, so much would have been made clear, so  much! I have never seen him, but I have heard him and felt him--felt his  presence, I mean.\"    \"In what way?\" asked Harley, leaning back in his chair and studying the  fierce face.    \"On several occasions on turning out the light in my bedroom and  looking across the lawn from my window I have observed the shadow of  someone--how do you say?--lurking in the garden.\"    \"The shadow?\"    \"Precisely. The person himself was concealed beneath a tree. When he  moved his shadow was visible on the ground.\"    \"You were not deceived by a waving branch?\"    \"Certainly not. I speak of a still, moonlight night.\"    \"Possibly, then, it was the shadow of a tramp,\" suggested Harley. \"I  gather that you refer to a house in the country?\"    \"It was not,\" declared Colonel Menendez, emphatically; \"it was not. I  wish to God I could believe it had been. Then there was, a month ago, an  attempt to enter my house.\"    Paul Harley exhibited evidence of a quickening curiosity. He had  perceived, as I had perceived, that the manner of the speaker differed  from that of the ordinary victim of delusion, with whom he had become  professionally familiar.    \"You had actual evidence of this?\" he suggested.    \"It was due to insomnia, sleeplessness, brought about, yes, I will admit  it, by apprehension, that I heard the footsteps of this intruder.\"    \"But you did not see him?\"    \"Only his shadow\"    \"What!\"    \"You can obtain the evidence of all my household that someone had  actually entered,\" declared Colonel Menendez, eagerly. \"Of this, at  least, I can give you the certain facts. Whoever it was had obtained  access through a kitchen window, had forced two locks, and was coming  stealthily along the hallway when the sound of his footsteps attracted  my attention.\"    \"What did you do?\"    \"I came out on to the landing and looked down the stairs. But even the  slight sound which I made had been sufficient to alarm the midnight  visitor, for I had never a glimpse of him. Only, as he went swiftly  back in the direction from which he had come, the moonlight shining in  through a window in the hall cast his shadow on the carpet.\"    \"Strange,\" murmured Harley. \"Very strange, indeed. The shadow told you  nothing?\"    \"Nothing at all.\"    Colonel Menendez hesitated momentarily, and glanced swiftly across at  Harley.    \"It was just a vague--do you say blur?--and then it was gone. But--\"    \"Yes,\" said Harley. \"But?\"    \"Ah,\" Colonel Menendez blew a cloud of smoke into the air, \"I come now  to the matter which I find so hard to explain.\"    He inhaled again deeply and was silent for a while.    \"Nothing was stolen?\" asked Harley.    \"Nothing whatever.\"    \"And no clue was left behind?\"    \"No clue except the filed fastening of a window and two open doors which  had been locked as usual when the household retired.\"    \"Hm,\" mused Harley again; \"this incident, of course, may have been an  isolated one and in no way connected with the surveillance of which you  complain. I mean that this person who undoubtedly entered your house  might prove to be an ordinary burglar.\"    \"On a table in the hallway of Cray's Folly,\" replied Colonel Menendez,  impressively--\"so my house is named--stands a case containing  presentation gold plate. The moonlight of which I have spoken was  shining fully upon this case, and does the burglar live who will pass  such a prize and leave it untouched?\"    \"I quite agree,\" said Harley, quietly, \"that this is a very big point.\"    \"You are beginning at last,\" suggested the Colonel, \"to believe that my  suspicions are not quite groundless?\"    \"There is a distinct possibility that they are more than suspicions,\"  agreed Harley; \"but may I suggest that there is something else? Have you  an enemy?\"    \"Who that has ever held public office is without enemies?\"    \"Ah, quite so. Then I suggest again that there is something else.\"    He gazed keenly at his visitor, and the latter, whilst meeting the look  unflinchingly with his large dark eyes, was unable to conceal the fact  that he had received a home thrust.    \"There are two points, Mr. Harley,\" he finally confessed, \"almost  certainly associated one with the other, if you understand, but both  these so--shall I say remote?--from my life, that I hesitate to mention  them. It seems fantastic to suppose that they contain a clue.\"    \"I beg of you,\" said Harley, \"to keep nothing back, however remote it  may appear to be. It is sometimes the seemingly remote things which  prove upon investigation to be the most intimate.\"    \"Very well,\" resumed Colonel Menendez, beginning to roll a second  cigarette whilst continuing to smoke the first, \"I know that you are  right, of course, but it is nevertheless very difficult for me to  explain. I mentioned the attempted burglary, if so I may term it, in  order to clear your mind of the idea that my fears were a myth. The next  point which I have concerns a man, a neighbour of mine in Surrey. Before  I proceed I should like to make it clear that I do not believe for a  moment that he is responsible for this unpleasant business.\"    Harley stared at him curiously. \"Nevertheless,\" he said, \"there must be  some data in your possession which suggest to your mind that he has some  connection with it.\"    \"There are, Mr. Harley, but they belong to things so mystic and far  away from ordinary crime that I fear you will think me,\" he shrugged  his great shoulders, \"a man haunted by strange superstitions. Do you say  'haunted?' Good. You understand. I should tell you, then, that although  of pure Spanish blood, I was born in Cuba. The greater part of my  life has been spent in the West Indies, where prior to '98 I held an  appointment under the Spanish Government. I have property, not only in  Cuba, but in some of the smaller islands which formerly were Spanish,  and I shall not conceal from you that during the latter years of my  administration I incurred the enmity of a section of the population. Do  I make myself clear?\"    Paul Harley nodded and exchanged a swift glance with me. I formed a  rapid mental picture of native life under the governorship of Colonel  Juan Menendez and I began to consider his story from a new viewpoint.  Seemingly rendered restless by his reflections, he stood up and began  to pace the floor, a tall but curiously graceful figure. I noticed the  bulldog tenacity of his chin, the intense pride in his bearing, and I  wondered what kind of menace had induced him to seek the aid of Paul  Harley; for whatever his failings might be, and I could guess at the  nature of several of them, that this thin-lipped Spanish soldier knew  the meaning of fear I was not prepared to believe.    \"Before you proceed further, Colonel Menendez,\" said Harley, \"might I  ask when you left Cuba?\"    \"Some three years ago,\" was his reply. \"Because--\" he hesitated  curiously--\"of health motives, I leased a property in England, believing  that here I should find peace.\"    \"In other words, you were afraid of something or someone in Cuba?\"    Colonel Menendez turned in a flash, glaring down at the speaker.    \"I never feared any man in my life, Mr. Harley,\" he said, coldly.    \"Then why are you here?\"    The Colonel placed the stump of his first cigarette in an ash tray and  lighted that which he had newly made.    \"It is true,\" he admitted. \"Forgive me. Yet what I said was that I never  feared any man.\"    He stood squarely in front of the Burmese cabinet, resting one hand upon  his hip. Then he added a remark which surprised me.    \"Do you know anything of Voodoo?\" he asked.    Paul Harley took his pipe from between his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#2)"],[1," covers the lawns of the red  Martians of the great waterways, but the trees and birds were unlike  anything that I had ever seen upon Mars, and then through the further  trees I could see that most un-Martian of all sights--an open sea, its  blue waters shimmering beneath the brazen sun.    As I rose to investigate further I experienced the same ridiculous  catastrophe that had met my first attempt to walk under Martian  conditions.  The lesser attraction of this smaller planet and the  reduced air pressure of its greatly rarefied atmosphere, afforded so  little resistance to my earthly muscles that the ordinary exertion of  the mere act of rising sent me several feet into the air and  precipitated me upon my face in the soft and brilliant grass of this  strange world.    This experience, however, gave me some slightly increased assurance  that, after all, I might indeed be in some, to me, unknown corner of  Mars, and this was very possible since during my ten years' residence  upon the planet I had explored but a comparatively tiny area of its  vast expanse.    I arose again, laughing at my forgetfulness, and soon had mastered once  more the art of attuning my earthly sinews to these changed conditions.    As I walked slowly down the imperceptible slope toward the sea I could  not help but note the park-like appearance of the sward and trees.  The  grass was as close-cropped and carpet-like as some old English lawn and  the trees themselves showed evidence of careful pruning to a uniform  height of about fifteen feet from the ground, so that as one turned his  glance in any direction the forest had the appearance at a little  distance of a vast, high-ceiled chamber.    All these evidences of careful and systematic cultivation convinced me  that I had been fortunate enough to make my entry into Mars on this  second occasion through the domain of a civilized people and that when  I should find them I would be accorded the courtesy and protection that  my rank as a Prince of the house of Tardos Mors entitled me to.    The trees of the forest attracted my deep admiration as I proceeded  toward the sea.  Their great stems, some of them fully a hundred feet  in diameter, attested their prodigious height, which I could only guess  at, since at no point could I penetrate their dense foliage above me to  more than sixty or eighty feet.    As far aloft as I could see the stems and branches and twigs were as  smooth and as highly polished as the newest of American-made pianos.  The wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony, while their  nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the subdued light of the  forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were  azure, scarlet, yellow, or deepest purple.    And in the same way was the foliage as gay and variegated as the stems,  while the blooms that clustered thick upon them may not be described in  any earthly tongue, and indeed might challenge the language of the gods.    As I neared the confines of the forest I beheld before me and between  the grove and the open sea, a broad expanse of meadow land, and as I  was about to emerge from the shadows of the trees a sight met my eyes  that banished all romantic and poetic reflection upon the beauties of  the strange landscape.    To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach, before me  only a vague, dim line indicated its further shore, while at my right a  mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks  to empty into the quiet sea before me.    At a little distance up the river rose mighty perpendicular bluffs,  from the very base of which the great river seemed to rise.    But it was not these inspiring and magnificent evidences of Nature's  grandeur that took my immediate attention from the beauties of the  forest.  It was the sight of a score of figures moving slowly about the  meadow near the bank of the mighty river.    Odd, grotesque shapes they were; unlike anything that I had ever seen  upon Mars, and yet, at a distance, most manlike in appearance.  The  larger specimens appeared to be about ten or twelve feet in height when  they stood erect, and to be proportioned as to torso and lower  extremities precisely as is earthly man.    Their arms, however, were very short, and from where I stood seemed as  though fashioned much after the manner of an elephant's trunk, in that  they moved in sinuous and snakelike undulations, as though entirely  without bony structure, or if there were bones it seemed that they must  be vertebral in nature.    As I watched them from behind the stem of a huge tree, one of the  creatures moved slowly in my direction, engaged in the occupation that  seemed to be the principal business of each of them, and which  consisted in running their oddly shaped hands over the surface of the  sward, for what purpose I could not determine.    As he approached quite close to me I obtained an excellent view of him,  and though I was later to become better acquainted with his kind, I may  say that that single cursory examination of this awful travesty on  Nature would have proved quite sufficient to my desires had I been a  free agent.  The fastest flier of the Heliumetic Navy could not quickly  enough have carried me far from this hideous creature.    Its hairless body was a strange and ghoulish blue, except for a broad  band of white which encircled its protruding, single eye: an eye that  was all dead white--pupil, iris, and ball.    Its nose was a ragged, inflamed, circular hole in the centre of its  blank face; a hole that resembled more closely nothing that I could  think of other than a fresh bullet wound which has not yet commenced to  bleed.    Below this repulsive orifice the face was quite blank to the chin, for  the thing had no mouth that I could discover.    The head, with the exception of the face, was covered by a tangled mass  of jet-black hair some eight or ten inches in length.  Each hair was  about the bigness of a large angleworm, and as the thing moved the  muscles of its scalp this awful head-covering seemed to writhe and  wriggle and crawl about the fearsome face as though indeed each  separate hair was endowed with independent life.    The body and the legs were as symmetrically human as Nature could have  fashioned them, and the feet, too, were human in shape, but of  monstrous proportions.  From heel to toe they were fully three feet  long, and very flat and very broad.    As it came quite close to me I discovered that its strange movements,  running its odd hands over the surface of the turf, were the result of  its peculiar method of feeding, which consists in cropping off the  tender vegetation with its razorlike talons and sucking it up from its  two mouths, which lie one in the palm of each hand, through its  arm-like throats.    In addition to the features which I have already described, the beast  was equipped with a massive tail about six feet in length, quite round  where it joined the body, but tapering to a flat, thin blade toward the  end, which trailed at right angles to the ground.    By far the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable creature,  however, were the two tiny replicas of it, each about six inches in  length, which dangled, one on either side, from its armpits.  They were  suspended by a small stem which seemed to grow from the exact tops of  their heads to where it connected them with the body of the adult.    Whether they were the young, or merely portions of a composite  creature, I did not know.    As I had been scrutinizing this weird monstrosity the balance of the  herd had fed quite close to me and I now saw that while many had the  smaller specimens dangling from them, not all were thus equipped, and I  further noted that the little ones varied in size from what appeared to  be but tiny unopened buds an inch in diameter through various stages of  development to the full-fledged and perfectly formed creature of ten to  twelve inches in length.    Feeding with the herd were many of the little fellows not much larger  than those which remained attached to their parents, and from the young  of that size the herd graded up to the immense adults.    Fearsome-looking as they were, I did not know whether to fear them or  not, for they did not seem to be particularly well equipped for  fighting, and I was on the point of stepping from my hiding-place and  revealing myself to them to note the effect upon them of the sight of a  man when my rash resolve was, fortunately for me, nipped in the bud by  a strange shrieking wail, which seemed to come from the direction of  the bluffs at my right.    Naked and unarmed, as I was, my end would have been both speedy and  horrible at the hands of these cruel creatures had I had time to put my  resolve into execution, but at the moment of the shriek each member of  the herd turned in the direction from which the sound seemed to come,  and at the same instant every particular snake-like hair upon their  heads rose stiffly perpendicular as if each had been a sentient  organism looking or listening for the source or meaning of the wail.  And indeed the latter proved to be the truth, for this strange growth  upon the craniums of the plant men of Barsoom represents the thousand  ears of these hideous creatures, the last remnant of the strange race  which sprang from the original Tree of Life.    Instantly every eye turned toward one member of the herd, a large  fellow who evidently was the leader.  A strange purring sound issued  from the mouth in the palm of one of his hands, and at the same time he  started rapidly toward the bluff, followed by the entire herd.    Their speed and method of locomotion were both remarkable, springing as  they did in great leaps of twenty or thirty feet, much after the manner  of a kangaroo.    They were rapidly disappearing when it occurred to me to follow them,  and so, hurling caution to the winds, I sprang across the"]]]
