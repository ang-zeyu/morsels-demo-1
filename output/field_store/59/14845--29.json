Stars were still overhead, gulls  wheeled and shrieked, and the broad river rippled duskily towards  Beaufort.    The shores were low and wooded, like any New England shore; there were a  few gunboats, twenty schooners, and some steamers, among them the famous  \"Planter,\" which Robert Small, the slave, presented to the nation. The  river-banks were soft and graceful, though low, and as we steamed up to  Beaufort on the flood-tide this morning, it seemed almost as fair as  the smooth and lovely canals which Stedman traversed to meet his negro  soldiers in Surinam. The air was cool as at home, yet the foliage seemed  green, glimpses of stiff tropical vegetation appeared along the banks,  with great clumps of shrubs, whose pale seed-vessels looked like tardy  blossoms. Then we saw on a picturesque point an old plantation, with  stately magnolia avenue, decaying house, and tiny church amid the woods,  reminding me of Virginia; behind it stood a neat encampment of white  tents, \"and there,\" said my companion, \"is your future regiment.\"    Three miles farther brought us to the pretty town of Beaufort, with its  stately houses amid Southern foliage. Reporting to General Saxton, I had  the luck to encounter a company of my destined command, marched in to  be mustered into the United States service. They were unarmed, and all  looked as thoroughly black as the most faithful philanthropist could  desire; there did not seem to be so much as a mulatto among them.  Their coloring suited me, all but the legs, which were clad in a lively  scarlet, as intolerable to my eyes as if I had been a turkey. I saw them  mustered; General Saxton talked to them a little, in his direct, manly  way; they gave close attention, though their faces looked impenetrable.  Then I conversed with some of them. The first to whom I spoke had been  wounded in a small expedition after lumber, from which a party had just  returned, and in which they had been under fire and had done very well.  I said, pointing to his lame arm,    \"Did you think that was more than you bargained for, my man?\"    His answer came promptly and stoutly,    \"I been a-tinking, Mas'r, dot's jess what I went for.\"    I thought this did well enough for my very first interchange of dialogue  with my recruits.      November 27, 1862.    Thanksgiving-Day; it is the first moment I have had for writing during  these three days, which have installed me into a new mode of life so  thoroughly that they seem three years. Scarcely pausing in New York or  in Beaufort, there seems to have been for me but one step from the  camp of a Massachusetts regiment to this, and that step over leagues of  waves.    It is a holiday wherever General Saxton's proclamation reaches. The  chilly sunshine and the pale blue river seems like New England, but  those alone. The air is full of noisy drumming, and of gunshots; for the  prize-shooting is our great celebration of the day, and the drumming is  chronic. My young barbarians are all at play. I look out from the broken  windows of this forlorn plantation-house, through avenues of great  live-oaks, with their hard, shining leaves, and their branches hung with  a universal drapery of soft, long moss, like fringe-trees struck with  grayness. Below, the sandy soil, scantly covered with coarse grass,  bristles with sharp palmettoes and aloes; all the vegetation is stiff,  shining, semi-tropical, with nothing soft or delicate in its texture.  Numerous plantation-buildings totter around, all slovenly and  unattractive, while the interspaces are filled with all manner of wreck  and refuse, pigs, fowls, dogs, and omnipresent Ethiopian infancy. All  this is the universal Southern panorama; but five minutes' walk beyond  the hovels and the live-oaks will bring one to something so un-Southern  that the whole Southern coast at this moment trembles at the suggestion  of such a thing, the camp of a regiment of freed slaves.    One adapts one's self so readily to new surroundings that already the  full zest of the novelty seems passing away from my perceptions, and I  write these lines in an eager effort to retain all I can. Already I am  growing used to the experience, at first so novel, of living among  five hundred men, and scarce a white face to be seen, of seeing them go  through all their daily processes, eating, frolicking, talking, just as  if they were white. Each day at dress-parade I stand with the customary  folding of the arms before a regimental line of countenances so black  that I can hardly tell whether the men stand steadily or not; black is  every hand which moves in ready cadence as I vociferate, \"Battalion!  Shoulder arms!\" nor is it till the line of white officers moves forward,  as parade is dismissed, that I am reminded that my own face is not the  color of coal.    The first few days on duty with a new regiment must be devoted almost  wholly to tightening reins; in this process one deals chiefly with the  officers, and I have as yet had but little personal intercourse with the  men. They concern me chiefly in bulk, as so many consumers of rations,  wearers of uniforms, bearers of muskets. But as the machine comes into  shape, I am beginning to decipher the individual parts. At first, of  course, they all looked just alike; the variety comes afterwards, and  they are just as distinguishable, the officers say, as so many whites.  Most of them are wholly raw, but there are many who have already been  for months in camp in the abortive \"Hunter Regiment,\" yet in that  loose kind of way which, like average militia training, is a doubtful  advantage. I notice that some companies, too, look darker than others,  though all are purer African than I expected. This is said to be partly  a geographical difference between the South Carolina and Florida men.  When the Rebels evacuated this region they probably took with them the  house-servants, including most of the mixed blood, so that the residuum  seems very black. But the men brought from Fernandina the other day  average lighter in complexion, and look more intelligent, and they  certainly take wonderfully to the drill.    It needs but a few days to show the absurdity of distrusting the  military availability of these people. They have quite as much average  comprehension as whites of the need of the thing, as much courage (I  doubt not), as much previous knowledge of the gun, and, above all,  a readiness of ear and of imitation, which, for purposes of drill,  counterbalances any defect of mental training. To learn the drill, one  does not want a set of college professors; one wants a squad of eager,  active, pliant school-boys; and the more childlike these pupils are the  better. There is no trouble about the drill; they will surpass whites  in that. As to camp-life, they have little to sacrifice; they are better  fed, housed, and clothed than ever in their lives before, and they  appear to have few inconvenient vices. They are simple, docile, and  affectionate almost to the point of absurdity. The same men who stood  fire in open field with perfect coolness, on the late expedition, have  come to me blubbering in the most irresistibly ludicrous manner on being  transferred from one company in the regiment to another.    In noticing the squad-drills I perceive that the men learn less  laboriously than whites that \"double, double, toil and trouble,\" which  is the elementary vexation of the drill-master, that they more rarely  mistake their left for their right, and are more grave and sedate while  under instruction. The extremes of jollity and sobriety, being greater  with them, are less liable to be intermingled; these companies can  be driven with a looser rein than my former one, for they restrain  themselves; but the moment they are dismissed from drill every tongue  is relaxed and every ivory tooth visible. This morning I wandered about  where the different companies were target-shooting, and their glee was  contagious. Such exulting shouts of \"Ki! ole man,\" when some steady  old turkey-shooter brought his gun down for an instant's aim, and then  unerringly hit the mark; and then, when some unwary youth fired his  piece into the ground at half-cock such guffawing and delight, such  rolling over and over on the grass, such dances of ecstasy, as made the  \"Ethiopian minstrelsy\" of the stage appear a feeble imitation.    Evening. Better still was a scene on which I stumbled to-night.  Strolling in the cool moonlight, I was attracted by a brilliant light  beneath the trees, and cautiously approached it. A circle of thirty or  forty soldiers sat around a roaring fire, while one old uncle, Cato by  name, was narrating an interminable tale, to the insatiable delight of  his audience. I came up into the dusky background, perceived only by a  few, and he still continued. It was a narrative, dramatized to the  last degree, of his adventures in escaping from his master to the Union  vessels; and even I, who have heard the stories of Harriet Tubman, and  such wonderful slave-comedians, never witnessed such a piece of  acting. When I came upon the scene he had just come unexpectedly upon a  plantation-house, and, putting a bold face upon it, had walked up to the  door.    \"Den I go up to de white man, berry humble, and say, would he please gib  ole man a mouthful for eat?    \"He say he must hab de valeration ob half a dollar.    \"Den I look berry sorry, and turn for go away.    \"Den he say I might gib him dat hatchet I had.    \"Den I say\" (this in a tragic vein) \"dat I must hab dat hatchet for  defend myself _from de dogs_!\"    [Immense applause, and one appreciating auditor says, chuckling, \"Dat  was your _arms_, ole man,\" which brings down the house again.]    \"Den he say de Yankee pickets was near by,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#2)"],[1," was right and what was wrong.  And they believed (and that was what  gave them courage) that the gods loved men, and taught them, and that  without the gods men were sure to come to ruin.  And in that they were  right enough, as we know--more right even than they thought; for without  God we can do nothing, and all wisdom comes from Him.    Now, you must not think of them in this book as learned men, living in  great cities, such as they were afterwards, when they wrought all their  beautiful works, but as country people, living in farms and walled  villages, in a simple, hard-working way; so that the greatest kings and  heroes cooked their own meals, and thought it no shame, and made their  own ships and weapons, and fed and harnessed their own horses; and the  queens worked with their maid-servants, and did all the business of the  house, and spun, and wove, and embroidered, and made their husbands'  clothes and their own.  So that a man was honoured among them, not  because he happened to be rich, but according to his skill, and his  strength, and courage, and the number of things which he could do.  For  they were but grown-up children, though they were right noble children  too; and it was with them as it is now at school--the strongest and  cleverest boy, though he be poor, leads all the rest.    Now, while they were young and simple they loved fairy tales, as you do  now.  All nations do so when they are young: our old forefathers did, and  called their stories 'Sagas.'  I will read you some of them some  day--some of the Eddas, and the Voluspa, and Beowulf, and the noble old  Romances.  The old Arabs, again, had their tales, which we now call the  'Arabian Nights.'  The old Romans had theirs, and they called them  'Fabulae,' from which our word 'fable' comes; but the old Hellens called  theirs 'Muthoi,' from which our new word 'myth' is taken.  But next to  those old Romances, which were written in the Christian middle age, there  are no fairy tales like these old Greek ones, for beauty, and wisdom, and  truth, and for making children love noble deeds, and trust in God to help  them through.    Now, why have I called this book 'The Heroes'?  Because that was the name  which the Hellens gave to men who were brave and skilful, and dare do  more than other men.  At first, I think, that was all it meant: but after  a time it came to mean something more; it came to mean men who helped  their country; men in those old times, when the country was half-wild,  who killed fierce beasts and evil men, and drained swamps, and founded  towns, and therefore after they were dead, were honoured, because they  had left their country better than they found it.  And we call such a man  a hero in English to this day, and call it a 'heroic' thing to suffer  pain and grief, that we may do good to our fellow-men.  We may all do  that, my children, boys and girls alike; and we ought to do it, for it is  easier now than ever, and safer, and the path more clear.  But you shall  hear how the Hellens said their heroes worked, three thousand years ago.  The stories are not all true, of course, nor half of them; you are not  simple enough to fancy that; but the meaning of them is true, and true  for ever, and that is--Do right, and God will help you.'

The rule which I have tried to follow has been this: when the  word has been hopelessly Latinised, as 'Phoebus' has been, I have left it  as it usually stands; but in other cases I have tried to keep the plain  Greek spelling, except when it would have seemed pedantic, or when, as in  the word 'Tiphus,' I should have given an altogether wrong notion of the  sound of the word.  It has been a choice of difficulties, which has been  forced on me by our strange habit of introducing boys to the Greek myths,  not in their original shape, but in a Roman disguise.]          STORY I.--PERSEUS      PART I  HOW PERSEUS AND HIS MOTHER CAME TO SERIPHOS      Once upon a time there were two princes who were twins.  Their names were  Acrisius and Proetus, and they lived in the pleasant vale of Argos, far  away in Hellas.  They had fruitful meadows and vineyards, sheep and oxen,  great herds of horses feeding down in Lerna Fen, and all that men could  need to make them blest: and yet they were wretched, because they were  jealous of each other.  From the moment they were born they began to  quarrel; and when they grew up each tried to take away the other's share  of the kingdom, and keep all for himself.  So first Acrisius drove out  Proetus; and he went across the seas, and brought home a foreign princess  for his wife, and foreign warriors to help him, who were called Cyclopes;  and drove out Acrisius in his turn; and then they fought a long while up  and down the land, till the quarrel was settled, and Acrisius took Argos  and one half the land, and Proetus took Tiryns and the other half.  And  Proetus and his Cyclopes built around Tiryns great walls of unhewn stone,  which are standing to this day.    But there came a prophet to that hard-hearted Acrisius and prophesied  against him, and said, 'Because you have risen up against your own blood,  your own blood shall rise up against you; because you have sinned against  your kindred, by your kindred you shall be punished.  Your daughter Danae  shall bear a son, and by that son's hands you shall die.  So the Gods  have ordained, and it will surely come to pass.'    And at that Acrisius was very much afraid; but he did not mend his ways.  He had been cruel to his own family, and, instead of repenting and being  kind to them, he went on to be more cruel than ever: for he shut up his  fair daughter Danae in a cavern underground, lined with brass, that no  one might come near her.  So he fancied himself more cunning than the  Gods: but you will see presently whether he was able to escape them.    Now it came to pass that in time Danae bore a son; so beautiful a babe  that any but King Acrisius would have had pity on it.  But he had no  pity; for he took Danae and her babe down to the seashore, and put them  into a great chest and thrust them out to sea, for the winds and the  waves to carry them whithersoever they would.    The north-west wind blew freshly out of the blue mountains, and down the  pleasant vale of Argos, and away and out to sea.  And away and out to sea  before it floated the mother and her babe, while all who watched them  wept, save that cruel father, King Acrisius.    So they floated on and on, and the chest danced up and down upon the  billows, and the baby slept upon its mother's breast: but the poor mother  could not sleep, but watched and wept, and she sang to her baby as they  floated; and the song which she sang you shall learn yourselves some day.    And now they are past the last blue headland, and in the open sea; and  there is nothing round them but the waves, and the sky, and the wind.  But the waves are gentle, and the sky is clear, and the breeze is tender  and low; for these are the days when Halcyone and Ceyx build their nests,  and no storms ever ruffle the pleasant summer sea.                          [Picture: Danae and her babe]    And who were Halcyone and Ceyx?  You shall hear while the chest floats  on.  Halcyone was a fairy maiden, the daughter of the beach and of the  wind.  And she loved a sailor-boy, and married him; and none on earth  were so happy as they.  But at last Ceyx was wrecked; and before he could  swim to the shore the billows swallowed him up.  And Halcyone saw him  drowning, and leapt into the sea to him; but in vain.  Then the Immortals  took pity on them both, and changed them into two fair sea-birds; and now  they build a floating nest every year, and sail up and down happily for  ever upon the pleasant seas of Greece.    So a night passed, and a day, and a long day it was for Danae; and  another night and day beside, till Danae was faint with hunger and  weeping, and yet no land appeared.  And all the while the babe slept  quietly; and at last poor Danae drooped her head and fell asleep likewise  with her cheek against the babe's.    After a while she was awakened suddenly; for the chest was jarring and  grinding, and the air was full of sound.  She looked up, and over her  head were mighty cliffs, all red in the setting sun, and around her rocks  and breakers, and flying flakes of foam.  She clasped her hands together,  and shrieked aloud for "]]]
