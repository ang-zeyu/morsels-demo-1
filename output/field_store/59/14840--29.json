If you make the dough too  soft at first, by using too much water, it will be sticky, and  require more flour, and will eventually be tough when baked. Do  not put your hands to it, as their warmth will injure it. Use the  knife instead. Always roll from you rather than to you, and press  lightly on the rolling-pin, except at the last.    It is difficult to make puff-paste in the summer, unless in a  cellar, or very cool room, and on a marble table. The butter  should, if possible, be washed the night before, and kept covered  with ice till you use it next day. The water should have ice in  it, and the butter should be iced as it sets on the paste-board.  After the paste is mixed, it should be put in a covered dish, and  set in cold water till you are ready to give it the last rolling.    With all these precautions to prevent its being heavy, it will not  rise as well, or be in any respect as good as in cold weather.    The handsomest way of ornamenting the edge of a pie or pudding is  to cut the rim in large square notches, and then fold over  triangularly one corner of every notch.      COMMON PASTE FOR PIES.      A pound and a half of sifted flour.    Three quarters of a pound of butter--washed.    _This will make one large pie or two small ones_.    Sift the flour into a pan. Cut the butter into two equal parts.  Cut one half of the butter into the flour, and cut it up as small  as possible. Mix it well with the flour, wetting it gradually with  a little cold water.    Spread some flour on your paste-board, take the lump of paste out  of the pan, flour your rolling-pin, and roll out the paste into a  large sheet. Then stick it over with the remaining half of the  butter in small pieces, and laid at equal distances. Throw on a  little flour, fold up the sheet of paste, flour it slightly, and  roll it out again. Then fold it up, and cut it in half or in four,  according to the size of your pies. Roll it out into round sheets  the size of your pie-plates, pressing rather harder on the  rolling-pin.    Butter your pie-plates, lay on your under crust, and trim the  edge. Fill the dish with the ingredients of which the pie is  composed, and lay on the lid, in which you must prick some holes,  or cut a small slit in the top. Crimp the edges with a sharp  knife.    Heap up the ingredients so that the pie will be highest in the  middle.    Some think it makes common paste more crisp and light, to beat it  hard on both sides with the rolling-pin, after you give it the  first rolling, when all the butter is in.    If the butter is very fresh, you may mix with the flour a  salt-spoonful of salt.      MINCE PIES      One pound and a half of boiled beef's heart, or fresh       tongue--chopped when cold.    Two pounds of beef suet, chopped fine.    Four pounds of pippin apples, chopped.    Two pounds of raisins, stoned and chopped.    Two pounds of currants, picked, washed, and dried.    Two pounds of powdered sugar.    One quart of white wine.    One quart of brandy.    One wine-glass of rose-water.    Two grated nutmegs.    Half an ounce of powdered cinnamon    A quarter of an ounce of powdered cloves    A quarter of an ounce of powdered mace    A teaspoon of salt.    Two large oranges.    Half a pound of citron, cut in slips.    Parboil a beef's heart, or a fresh tongue. After you have taken  off the skin and fat, weigh a pound and a half. When it is cold,  chop it very fine. Take the inside of the suet; weigh two pounds,  and chop it as fine as possible. Mix the meat and suet together,  adding the salt. Pare, core, and chop the apples, and then stone  and chop the raisins. Having prepared the currants, add them to  the other fruit, and mix the fruit with the meat and suet. Put in  the sugar and spice, and the grated peel and juice of the oranges.  Wet the whole with the rose water and liquor, and mix all well  together.    Make the paste, allowing for each pie, half a pound of butter and  three quarters of a pound of sifted flour. Make it in the same  manner as puff-paste, but it will not be quite so rich. Lay a  sheet of paste all over a soup-plate. Fill it with mince-meat,  laying slips of citron on the top. Roll out a sheet of paste, for  the lid of the pie. Put it on, and crimp the edges with a knife.  Prick holes in the lid.    Bake the pies half an hour in a brisk oven.    Keep your mince meat in a jar tightly covered. Set it in a dry,  cool place, and occasionally add more brandy to it.    Instead of the heart or tongue, you may, if you choose, use part  of a round of fresh beef.      PLUM PUDDING      One pound of raisins, stoned and cut in half.    One pound of currants, picked, washed and dried.    One pound of beef suet chopped fine.    One pound of grated stale bread, or, half a pound of flour and      half a pound of bread.    Eight eggs.    A quarter of a pound of sugar.    A glass of brandy.    A pint of milk.    A glass of wine.    Two nutmegs, grated.    A table-spoonful of mixed cinnamon and mace.    A salt-spoonful of salt.    You must prepare all your ingredients the day before (except  beating the eggs) that in the morning you may have nothing to do  but to mix them, as the pudding will require six hours to boil.    Beat the eggs very light, then put to them half the milk and beat  both together. Stir in gradually the flour and grated bread. Next  add the sugar by degrees. Then the suet and fruit alternately. The  fruit must be well sprinkled with flour, lest it sink to the  bottom. Stir very hard. Then add the spice and liquor, and lastly  the remainder of the milk. Stir the whole mixture very well  together. If it is not thick enough, add a little more grated  bread or flour. If there is too much bread or flour, the pudding  will be hard and heavy.    Dip your pudding-cloth, in boiling water, shake it out and  sprinkle it slightly with flour. Lay it in a pan and pour the  mixture into the cloth. Tie it up carefully, allowing room for the  pudding to swell.    Boil it six hours, and turn it carefully out of the cloth.    Before you send it to table, have ready some blanched sweet  almonds cut in slips, or some slips of citron, or both. Stick them  all over the outside of the pudding.    Eat it with wine, or with a sauce made of drawn butter, wine and  nutmeg.    The pudding will be improved if you add to the other ingredients,  the grated rind of a large lemon or orange.      LEMON PUDDING      One small lemon, with a smooth thin rind.    Three eggs.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    A quarter of a pound of fresh butter--washed.    A table-spoonful of white wine and brandy, mixed.    A tea-spoonful of rose-water.      Five ounces of sifted flour, and a quarter of a pound of      fresh butter for the paste.    Grate the yellow part of the rind of a small lemon. Then cut the  lemon in half, and squeeze the juice into the plate that contains  the grated rind, carefully taking out all the seeds. Mix the juice  and rind together.    Put a quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar into a deep  earthen pan, and cut up in it a quarter of a pound of the best  fresh butter. If the weather is very cold, set the pan near the  fire, for a few minutes, to soften the butter, but do not allow it  to melt or it will be heavy. Stir the butter and sugar together,  with a stick or wooden spoon, till it is perfectly light and of  the consistence of cream.    Put the eggs in a shallow broad pan, and beat them with an  egg-beater or rods, till they are quite smooth, and as thick as a  boiled custard. Then stir the eggs, gradually, into the pan of  butter and sugar. Add the liquor and rose water by degrees, and  then stir in, gradually, the juice and grated rind of the lemon.  Stir the whole very hard, after all the ingredients are in.    Have ready a puff-paste made of five ounces of sifted flour, and a  quarter of a pound of fresh butter. The paste must be made with as  little water as possible. Roll it out in a circular sheet, thin in  the centre, and thicker towards the edges, and just large enough  to cover the bottom, sides, and edges of a soup-plate. Butter the  soup-plate very well, and lay the paste in it, making it neat and  even round the broad edge of the plate. With a sharp knife, trim  off the superfluous dough, and notch the edges. Put in the mixture  with a spoon, and bake the pudding about half an hour, in a  moderate oven. It should be baked of a very light brown. If the  oven is too hot, the paste will not have time to rise well. If too  cold, it will be clammy. When the pudding is cool, grate  loaf-sugar over it.    Before using lemons for any purpose, always roll them awhile with  your hand on a table. This will cause them to yield a larger  quantity of juice.      ORANGE PUDDING.      One large orange, of a deep colour, and smooth thin rind.    One lime.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.    Three eggs.    A table-spoonful of mixed wine and brandy.    A tea-spoonful of rose-water.    Grate the yellow rind of the orange and lime, and squeeze the  juice into a saucer or soup-plate, taking out all the seeds.    Stir the butter and sugar to a cream.    Beat the eggs as light as possible, and then stir them by degrees  into the pan of butter and sugar. Add, gradually, the liquor and  rose-water, and then by degrees, the orange and lime. Stir all  well together.    Have ready a sheet of puff-paste made of five ounces of sifted  flour, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Lay the paste in  a buttered soup-plate. Trim and notch the edges, and then put in  the mixture. Bake it about half an hour, in a moderate oven. Grate  loaf-sugar over it, before you send it to table.      COCOA-NUT PUDDING      A quarter of a pound of cocoa-nut, grated.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6684"],[0,"Uneasy Money (#2)"],[1," steadily-diminishing golf handicap,  and a host of friends in every walk of life, Bill had felt that it  would be absurd not to be happy and contented.    But Claire had made a difference. There was no question of that.  In the first place, she resolutely declined to marry him on four  hundred pounds a year. She scoffed at four hundred pounds a year.  To hear her talk, you would have supposed that she had been  brought up from the cradle to look on four hundred pounds a year  as small change to be disposed of in tips and cab fares. That in  itself would have been enough to sow doubts in Bill's mind as to  whether he had really got all the money that a reasonable man  needed; and Claire saw to it that these doubts sprouted, by  confining her conversation on the occasions of their meeting  almost entirely to the great theme of money, with its minor  sub-divisions of How to Get It, Why Don't You Get It? and I'm Sick  and Tired of Not Having It.    She developed this theme to-day, not only on the stairs leading to  the grillroom, but even after they had seated themselves at their  table. It was a relief to Bill when the arrival of the waiter with  food caused a break in the conversation and enabled him adroitly  to change the subject.    'What have you been doing this morning?' he asked.    'I went to see Maginnis at the theatre.'    'Oh!'    'I had a wire from him asking me to call. They want me to take up  Claudia Winslow's part in the number one company.'    'That's good.'    'Why?'    'Well--er--what I mean--well, isn't it? What I mean is, leading  part, and so forth.'    'In a touring company?'    'Yes, I see what you mean,' said Lord Dawlish, who didn't at all.  He thought rather highly of the number one companies that hailed  from the theatre of which Mr Maginnis was proprietor.    'And anyhow, I ought to have had the part in the first place  instead of when the tour's half over. They are at Southampton this  week. He wants me to join them there and go on to Portsmouth with  them.'    'You'll like Portsmouth.'    'Why?'    'Well--er--good links quite near.'    'You know I don't play golf.'    'Nor do you. I was forgetting. Still, it's quite a jolly place.'    'It's a horrible place. I loathe it. I've half a mind not to go.'    'Oh, I don't know.'    'What do you mean?'    Lord Dawlish was feeling a little sorry for himself. Whatever he  said seemed to be the wrong thing. This evidently was one of the  days on which Claire was not so sweet-tempered as on some other  days. It crossed his mind that of late these irritable moods of  hers had grown more frequent. It was not her fault, poor girl! he  told himself. She had rather a rotten time.    It was always Lord Dawlish's habit on these occasions to make this  excuse for Claire. It was such a satisfactory excuse. It covered  everything. But, as a matter of fact, the rather rotten time which  she was having was not such a very rotten one. Reducing it to its  simplest terms, and forgetting for the moment that she was an  extraordinarily beautiful girl--which his lordship found it  impossible to do--all that it amounted to was that, her mother  having but a small income, and existence in the West Kensington  flat being consequently a trifle dull for one with a taste for the  luxuries of life, Claire had gone on the stage. By birth she  belonged to a class of which the female members are seldom called  upon to earn money at all, and that was one count of her grievance  against Fate. Another was that she had not done as well on the  stage as she had expected to do. When she became engaged to Bill  she had reached a point where she could obtain without difficulty  good parts in the touring companies of London successes, but  beyond that it seemed it was impossible for her to soar. It was  not, perhaps, a very exhilarating life, but, except to the eyes of  love, there was nothing tragic about it. It was the cumulative  effect of having a mother in reduced circumstances and grumbling  about it, of being compelled to work and grumbling about that, and  of achieving in her work only a semi-success and grumbling about  that also, that--backed by her looks--enabled Claire to give quite  a number of people, and Bill Dawlish in particular, the impression  that she was a modern martyr, only sustained by her indomitable  courage.    So Bill, being requested in a peevish voice to explain what he  meant by saying, 'Oh, I don't know,' condoned the peevishness. He  then bent his mind to the task of trying to ascertain what he had  meant.    'Well,' he said, 'what I mean is, if you don't show up won't it be  rather a jar for old friend Maginnis? Won't he be apt to foam at  the mouth a bit and stop giving you parts in his companies?'    'I'm sick of trying to please Maginnis. What's the good? He never  gives me a chance in London. I'm sick of being always on tour. I'm  sick of everything.'    'It's the heat,' said Lord Dawlish, most injudiciously.    'It isn't the heat. It's you!'    'Me? What have I done?'    'It's what you've not done. Why can't you exert yourself and make  some money?'    Lord Dawlish groaned a silent groan. By a devious route, but with  unfailing precision, they had come homing back to the same old  subject.    'We have been engaged for six months, and there seems about as  much chance of our ever getting married as of--I can't think of  anything unlikely enough. We shall go on like this till we're  dead.'    'But, my dear girl!'    'I wish you wouldn't talk to me as if you were my grandfather.  What were you going to say?'    'Only that we can get married this afternoon if you'll say the  word.'    'Oh, don't let us go into all that again! I'm not going to marry  on four hundred a year and spend the rest of my life in a pokey  little flat on the edge of London. Why can't you make more money?'    'I did have a dash at it, you know. I waylaid old Bodger--Colonel  Bodger, on the committee of the club, you know--and suggested over  a whisky-and-soda that the management of Brown's would be behaving  like sportsmen if they bumped my salary up a bit, and the old boy  nearly strangled himself trying to suck down Scotch and laugh at  the same time. I give you my word, he nearly expired on the  smoking-room floor. When he came to he said that he wished I  wouldn't spring my good things on him so suddenly, as he had a  weak heart. He said they were only paying me my present salary  because they liked me so much. You know, it was decent of the old  boy to say that.'    'What is the good of being liked by the men in your club if you  won't make any use of it?'    'How do you mean?'    'There are endless things you could do. You could have got Mr  Breitstein elected at Brown's if you had liked. They wouldn't have  dreamed of blackballing any one proposed by a popular man like you,  and Mr Breitstein asked you personally to use your influence--you  told me so.'    'But, my dear girl--I mean my darling--Breitstein! He's the limit!  He's the worst bounder in London.'    'He's also one of the richest men in London. He would have done  anything for you. And you let him go! You insulted him!'    'Insulted him?'    'Didn't you send him an admission ticket to the Zoo?'    'Oh, well, yes, I did do that. He thanked me and went the  following Sunday. Amazing how these rich Johnnies love getting  something for nothing. There was that old American I met down at  Marvis Bay last year--'    'You threw away a wonderful chance of making all sorts of money.  Why, a single tip from Mr Breitstein would have made your  fortune.'    'But, Claire, you know, there are some things--what I mean is, if  they like me at Brown's, it's awfully decent of them and all that,  but I couldn't take advantage of it to plant a fellow like  Breitstein on them. It wouldn't be playing the game.'    'Oh, nonsense!'    Lord Dawlish looked unhappy, but said nothing. This matter of Mr  Breitstein had been touched upon by Claire in previous conversations,  and it was a subject for which he had little liking. Experience had  taught him that none of the arguments which seemed so conclusive  to him--to wit, that the financier had on two occasions only just  escaped imprisonment for fraud, and, what was worse, made a  noise when he drank soup, like water running out of a bathtub--had  the least effect upon her. The only thing to do when Mr Breitstein  came up in the course of chitchat over the festive board was to  stay quiet until he blew over.    'That old American you met at Marvis Bay,' said Claire, her memory  flitting back to the remark which she had interrupted; 'well,  there's another case. You could easily have got him to do  something for you.'    'Claire, really!' said his goaded lordship, protestingly. 'How on  earth? I only met the man on the links.'    'But you were very nice to him. You told me yourself that you  spent hours helping him to get rid of his slice, whatever that  is.'    'We happened to be the only two down there at the time, so I was  as civil as I could manage. If you're marooned at a Cornish  seaside resort out of the season with a man, you can't spend your  time dodging him. And this man had a slice that fascinated me. I  felt at the time that it was my mission in life to cure him, so I  had a dash at it. But I don't see how on the strength of that I  could expect the old boy to adopt me. He probably forgot my  existence after I had left.'    'You said you met him in London a month or two afterwards, and he  hadn't forgotten you.'    'Well, yes, that's true. He was walking up the Haymarket and I was  walking down. I caught his eye, and he nodded and passed on. I  don't see how I could construe that into an invitation to go and  sit on his lap and help myself out of his pockets.'    'You couldn't expect him to go out of his way to help you; but  probably if you had gone to him he would have done something.'    'You haven't the pleasure of Mr Ira Nutcombe's acquaintance,  Claire, or you"]]]
