I believe that Juvenal, one  of the ancient writers who best understood human nature, was right in  saying:           \"Nil erit ulterius, quod nostris moribus addat          Posteritas: eadem cupient facientque minores.\"    Leipsic, October 15th, 1877.            U A R D A.          CHAPTER 1.    By the walls of Thebes--the old city of a hundred gates--the Nile  spreads to a broad river; the heights, which follow the stream on both  sides, here take a more decided outline; solitary, almost cone-shaped  peaks stand out sharply from the level background of the many-colored.  limestone hills, on which no palm-tree flourishes and in which no humble  desert-plant can strike root. Rocky crevasses and gorges cut more or  less deeply into the mountain range, and up to its ridge extends the  desert, destructive of all life, with sand and stones, with rocky cliffs  and reef-like, desert hills.    Behind the eastern range the desert spreads to the Red Sea; behind the  western it stretches without limit, into infinity. In the belief of the  Egyptians beyond it lay the region of the dead.    Between these two ranges of hills, which serve as walls or ramparts to  keep back the desert-sand, flows the fresh and bounteous Nile, bestowing  blessing and abundance; at once the father and the cradle of millions of  beings. On each shore spreads the wide plain of black and fruitful soil,  and in the depths many-shaped creatures, in coats of mail or scales,  swarm and find subsistence.    The lotos floats on the mirror of the waters, and among the papyrus  reeds by the shore water-fowl innumerable build their nests. Between the  river and the mountain-range lie fields, which after the seed-time are  of a shining blue-green, and towards the time of harvest glow like gold.  Near the brooks and water-wheels here and there stands a shady sycamore;  and date-palms, carefully tended, group themselves in groves. The  fruitful plain, watered and manured every year by the inundation, lies  at the foot of the sandy desert-hills behind it, and stands out like a  garden flower-bed from the gravel-path.    In the fourteenth century before Christ--for to so remote a date we must  direct the thoughts of the reader--impassable limits had been set by the  hand of man, in many places in Thebes, to the inroads of the water; high  dykes of stone and embankments protected the streets and squares, the  temples and the palaces, from the overflow.    Canals that could be tightly closed up led from the dykes to the land  within, and smaller branch-cuttings to the gardens of Thebes.    On the right, the eastern bank of the Nile, rose the buildings of  the far-famed residence of the Pharaohs. Close by the river stood the  immense and gaudy Temples of the city of Amon; behind these and at a  short distance from the Eastern hills--indeed at their very foot and  partly even on the soil of the desert--were the palaces of the King and  nobles, and the shady streets in which the high narrow houses of the  citizens stood in close rows.    Life was gay and busy in the streets of the capital of the Pharaohs.    The western shore of the Nile showed a quite different scene. Here too  there was no lack of stately buildings or thronging men; but while on  the farther side of the river there was a compact mass of houses, and  the citizens went cheerfully and openly about their day's work, on this  side there were solitary splendid structures, round which little houses  and huts seemed to cling as children cling to the protection of a  mother. And these buildings lay in detached groups.    Any one climbing the hill and looking down would form the notion that  there lay below him a number of neighboring villages, each with its  lordly manor house. Looking from the plain up to the precipice of the  western hills, hundreds of closed portals could be seen, some solitary,  others closely ranged in rows; a great number of them towards the foot  of the slope, yet more half-way up, and a few at a considerable height.    And even more dissimilar were the slow-moving, solemn groups in the  roadways on this side, and the cheerful, confused throng yonder. There,  on the eastern shore, all were in eager pursuit of labor or recreation,  stirred by pleasure or by grief, active in deed and speech; here, in  the west, little was spoken, a spell seemed to check the footstep of the  wanderer, a pale hand to sadden the bright glance of every eye, and to  banish the smile from every lip.    And yet many a gaily-dressed bark stopped at the shore, there was no  lack of minstrel bands, grand processions passed on to the western  heights; but the Nile boats bore the dead, the songs sung here were  songs of lamentation, and the processions consisted of mourners  following the sarcophagus.    We are standing on the soil of the City of the Dead of Thebes.    Nevertheless even here nothing is wanting for return and revival, for to  the Egyptian his dead died not. He closed his eyes, he bore him to the  Necropolis, to the house of the embalmer, or Kolchytes, and then to the  grave; but he knew that the souls of the departed lived on; that the  justified absorbed into Osiris floated over the Heavens in the vessel  of the Sun; that they appeared on earth in the form they choose to take  upon them, and that they might exert influence on the current of the  lives of the survivors. So he took care to give a worthy interment to  his dead, above all to have the body embalmed so as to endure long: and  had fixed times to bring fresh offerings for the dead of flesh and fowl,  with drink-offerings and sweet-smelling essences, and vegetables and  flowers.    Neither at the obsequies nor at the offerings might the ministers of  the gods be absent, and the silent City of the Dead was regarded as a  favored sanctuary in which to establish schools and dwellings for the  learned.    So it came to pass that in the temples and on the site Of the  Necropolis, large communities of priests dwelt together, and close to  the extensive embalming houses lived numerous Kolchytes, who handed down  the secrets of their art from father to son.    Besides these there were other manufactories and shops. In the former,  sarcophagi of stone and of wood, linen bands for enveloping mummies, and  amulets for decorating them, were made; in the latter, merchants kept  spices and essences, flowers, fruits, vegetables and pastry for sale.  Calves, gazelles, goats, geese and other fowl, were fed on enclosed  meadow-plats, and the mourners betook themselves thither to select what  they needed from among the beasts pronounced by the priests to be clean  for sacrifice, and to have them sealed with the sacred seal. Many bought  only part of a victim at the shambles--the poor could not even do  this. They bought only colored cakes in the shape of beasts, which  symbolically took the place of the calves and geese which their means  were unable to procure. In the handsomest shops sat servants of the  priests, who received forms written on rolls of papyrus which were  filled up in the writing room of the temple with those sacred verses  which the departed spirit must know and repeat to ward off the evil  genius of the deep, to open the gate of the under world, and to be held  righteous before Osiris and the forty-two assessors of the subterranean  court of justice.    What took place within the temples was concealed from view, for each  was surrounded by a high enclosing wall with lofty, carefully-closed  portals, which were only opened when a chorus of priests came out to  sing a pious hymn, in the morning to Horus the rising god, and in the  evening to Tum the descending god.       [The course of the Sun was compared to that of the life of Man.     He rose as the child Horns, grew by midday to the hero Ra, who     conquered the Uraeus snake for his diadem, and by evening was an old     Man, Tum. Light had been born of darkness, hence Tum was regarded     as older than Horns and the other gods of light.]    As soon as the evening hymn of the priests was heard, the Necropolis was  deserted, for the mourners and those who were visiting the graves were  required by this time to return to their boats and to quit the City of  the Dead. Crowds of men who had marched in the processions of the  west bank hastened in disorder to the shore, driven on by the body of  watchmen who took it in turns to do this duty and to protect the graves  against robbers. The merchants closed their booths, the embalmers and  workmen ended their day's work and retired to their houses, the priests  returned to the temples, and the inns were filled with guests, who  had come hither on long pilgrimages from a distance, and who preferred  passing the night in the vicinity of the dead whom they had come to  visit, to going across to the bustling noisy city farther shore.    The voices of the singers and of the wailing women were hushed, even the  song of the sailors on the numberless ferry boats from the western shore  to Thebes died away, its faint echo was now and then borne across on the  evening air, and at last all was still.    A cloudless sky spread over the silent City of the Dead, now and then  darkened for an instant by the swiftly passing shade of a bat returning  to its home in a cave or cleft of the rock after flying the whole  evening near the Nile to catch flies, to drink, and so prepare itself  for the next day's sleep. From time to time black forms with long  shadows glided over the still illuminated plain--the jackals, who  at this hour frequented the shore to slake their thirst, and often  fearlessly showed themselves in troops in the vicinity of the pens of  geese and goats.    It was forbidden to hunt these robbers, as they were accounted sacred to  the god Anubis, the tutelary of sepulchres; and indeed they did little  mischief, for they found abundant food in the tombs.       [The jackal-headed god Anubis was the son of Osiris and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#2)"],[1,"to have built the most beautiful of the Pyramids, the Pyramid of  Mycerinus or Menkera. One tale related of her and reported by Strabo and  AElian probably gave rise to our oldest and most beautiful fairy tale,  Cinderella; another is near akin to the Loreley legend. An eagle,  according to AElian--the wind, in Strabo's tale,--bore away Rhodopis'  slippers while she was bathing in the Nile, and laid them at the feet of  the king, when seated on his throne of justice in the open market.  The little slippers so enchanted him that he did not rest until he had  discovered their owner and made her his queen.    The second legend tells us how a wonderfully beautiful naked woman  could be seen sitting on the summit of one of the pyramids (ut in una ex  pyramidibus); and how she drove the wanderers in the desert mad through  her exceeding loveliness.    Moore borrowed this legend and introduces it in the following verse:           \"Fair Rhodope, as story tells--          The bright unearthly nymph, who dwells          'Mid sunless gold and jewels hid,          The lady of the Pyramid.\"    Fabulous as these stories sound, they still prove that Rhodopis must  have been no ordinary woman. Some scholars would place her on a level  with the beautiful and heroic Queen Nitokris, spoken of by Julius  Africanus, Eusebius and others, and whose name, (signifying the  victorious Neith) has been found on the monuments, applied to a queen  of the sixth dynasty. This is a bold conjecture; it adds however to the  importance of our heroine; and without doubt many traditions referring  to the one have been transferred to the other, and vice versa.  Herodotus lived so short a time after Rhodopis, and tells so many exact  particulars of her private life that it is impossible she should have  been a mere creation of fiction. The letter of Darius, given at the  end of Vol. II., is intended to identify the Greek Rhodopis with the  mythical builder of the Pyramid. I would also mention here that she  is called Doricha by Sappho. This may have been her name before she  received the title of the \"rosy-cheeked one.\"    I must apologize for the torrent of verse that appears in the  love-scenes between Sappho and Bartja; it is also incumbent upon me to  say a few words about the love-scenes themselves, which I have altered  very slightly in the new edition, though they have been more severely  criticised than any other portion of the work.    First I will confess that the lines describing the happy love of a  handsome young couple to whom I had myself become warmly attached,  flowed from my pen involuntarily, even against my will (I intended to  write a novel in prose) in the quiet night, by the eternal Nile, among  the palms and roses. The first love-scene has a story of its own to me.  I wrote it in half an hour, almost unconsciously. It may be read in my  book that the Persians always reflected in the morning, when sober, upon  the resolutions formed the night before, while drunk. When I examined in  the sunshine what had come into existence by lamplight, I grew doubtful  of its merits, and was on the point of destroying the love-scenes  altogether, when my dear friend Julius Hammer, the author of \"Schau  in Dich, und Schau um Dich,\" too early summoned to the other world by  death, stayed my hand. Their form was also approved by others, and I  tell myself that the 'poetical' expression of love is very similar in  all lands and ages, while lovers' conversations and modes of intercourse  vary according to time and place. Besides, I have to deal with one of  those by no means rare cases, where poetry can approach nearer the truth  than prudent, watchful prose. Many of my honored critics have censured  these scenes; others, among whom are some whose opinion I specially  value, have lavished the kindest praise upon them. Among these gentlemen  I will mention A. Stahr, C. V. Holtei, M. Hartmann, E. Hoefer, W.  Wolfsohn, C. Leemans, Professor Veth of Amsterdam, etc. Yet I will not  conceal the fact that some, whose opinion has great weight, have asked:  \"Did the ancients know anything of love, in our sense of the word?  Is not romantic love, as we know it, a result of Christianity?\" The  following sentence, which stands at the head of the preface to my first  edition, will prove that I had not ignored this question when I began my  task.       \"It has often been remarked that in Cicero's letters and those of     Pliny the younger there are unmistakable indications of sympathy     with the more sentimental feeling of modern days. I find in them     tones of deep tenderness only, such as have arisen and will arise     from sad and aching hearts in every land and every age.\"                   A. v. HUMBOLDT. Cosmos II. P. 19.    This opinion of our great scholar is one with which I cheerfully  coincide and would refer my readers to the fact that love-stories were  written before the Christian era: the Amor and Psyche of Apuleius for  instance. Indeed love in all its forms was familiar to the ancients.  Where can we find a more beautiful expression of ardent passion than  glows in Sappho's songs? or of patient faithful constancy than in  Homer's Penelope? Could there be a more beautiful picture of the union  of two loving hearts, even beyond the grave, than Xenophon has preserved  for us in his account of Panthea and Abradatas? or the story of Sabinus  the Gaul and his wife, told in the history of Vespasian? Is there  anywhere a sweeter legend than that of the Halcyons, the ice-birds, who  love one another so tenderly that when the male becomes enfeebled by  age, his mate carries him on her outspread wings whithersoever he will;  and the gods, desiring to reward such faithful love, cause the sun to  shine more kindly, and still the winds and waves on the \"Halcyon days\"  during which these birds are building their nest and brooding over their  young? There can surely have been no lack of romantic love in days when  a used-up man of the world, like Antony, could desire in his will that  wherever he died his body might be laid by the side of his beloved  Cleopatra: nor of the chivalry of love when Berenice's beautiful hair  was placed as a constellation in the heavens. Neither can we believe  that devotion in the cause of love could be wanting when a whole  nation was ready to wage a fierce and obstinate war for the sake of one  beautiful woman. The Greeks had an insult to revenge, but the Trojans  fought for the possession of Helen. Even the old men of Ilium were ready  \"to suffer long for such a woman.\" And finally is not the whole question  answered in Theocritus' unparalleled poem, \"the Sorceress?\" We see the  poor love-lorn girl and her old woman-servant, Thestylis, cowering over  the fire above which the bird supposed to possess the power of bringing  back the faithless Delphis is sitting in his wheel. Simoetha has learnt  many spells and charms from an Assyrian, and she tries them all. The  distant roar of the waves, the stroke rising from the fire, the dogs  howling in the street, the tortured fluttering bird, the old woman, the  broken-hearted girl and her awful spells, all join in forming a night  scene the effect of which is heightened by the calm cold moonshine.  The old woman leaves the girl, who at once ceases to weave her spells,  allows her pent-up tears to have their way, and looking up to Selene the  moon, the lovers' silent confidante, pours out her whole story: how when  she first saw the beautiful Delphis her heart had glowed with love, she  had seen nothing more of the train of youths who followed him, \"and,\"  (thus sadly the poet makes her speak)                   \"how I gained my home          I knew not; some strange fever wasted me.          Ten days and nights I lay upon my bed.          O tell me, mistress Moon, whence came my love!\"    \"Then\" (she continues) when Delphis at last crossed her threshold:                             \"I          Became all cold like snow, and from my brow          Brake the damp dewdrops: utterance I had none,          Not e'en such utterance as a babe may make          That babbles to its mother in its dreams;          But all my fair frame stiffened into wax,--          O tell me mistress Moon, whence came my love!\"    Whence came her love? thence, whence it comes to us now. The love of the  creature to its Creator, of man to God, is the grand and yet gracious  gift of Christianity. Christ's command to love our neighbor called  into existence not only the conception of philanthropy, but of humanity  itself, an idea unknown to the heathen world, where love had been at  widest limited to their native town and country. The love of man and  wife has without doubt been purified and transfigured by Christianity;  still it is possible that a Greek may have loved as tenderly and  longingly as a Christian. The more ardent glow of passion at least  cannot be denied to the ancients. And did not their love find vent  in the same expressions as our own? Who does not know the charming  roundelay:              \"Drink the glad wine with me,            With me spend youth's gay hours;            Or a sighing lover be,            Or crown thy brow with flowers.            When I am merry and mad,            Merry and mad be you;            When I am sober and sad,            Be sad and sober too!\"  --written however by no poet of modern days, but by Praxilla, in the  fifth century before Christ. Who would guess either that Moore's little  song was modelled on one written even earlier than the date of our  story?              \"As o'er her loom the Lesbian maid            In love-sick languor hung her head.            Unknowing where her fingers stray'd,            She weeping turned away and said,'            Oh, my sweet mother, 'tis in vain,              I cannot weave as once I wove;            So wilder'd is my heart and brain            With thinking of that youth I love.'\"    If my space allowed I could add"]]]
