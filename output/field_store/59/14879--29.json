If so be a time comes when  yeh have to be kilt or do a mean thing, why, Henry, don't think of  anything 'cept what's right, because there's many a woman has to bear  up 'ginst sech things these times, and the Lord 'll take keer of us all.    \"Don't forgit about the socks and the shirts, child; and I've put a cup  of blackberry jam with yer bundle, because I know yeh like it above all  things.  Good-by, Henry.  Watch out, and be a good boy.\"    He had, of course, been impatient under the ordeal of this speech.  It  had not been quite what he expected, and he had borne it with an air of  irritation.  He departed feeling vague relief.    Still, when he had looked back from the gate, he had seen his mother  kneeling among the potato parings.  Her brown face, upraised, was  stained with tears, and her spare form was quivering.  He bowed his  head and went on, feeling suddenly ashamed of his purposes.    From his home he had gone to the seminary to bid adieu to many  schoolmates.  They had thronged about him with wonder and admiration.  He had felt the gulf now between them and had swelled with calm pride.  He and some of his fellows who had donned blue were quite overwhelmed  with privileges for all of one afternoon, and it had been a very  delicious thing.  They had strutted.    A certain light-haired girl had made vivacious fun at his martial  spirit, but there was another and darker girl whom he had gazed at  steadfastly, and he thought she grew demure and sad at sight of his  blue and brass.  As he had walked down the path between the rows of  oaks, he had turned his head and detected her at a window watching his  departure.  As he perceived her, she had immediately begun to stare up  through the high tree branches at the sky.  He had seen a good deal of  flurry and haste in her movement as she changed her attitude.  He often  thought of it.    On the way to Washington his spirit had soared.  The regiment was fed  and caressed at station after station until the youth had believed that  he must be a hero.  There was a lavish expenditure of bread and cold  meats, coffee, and pickles and cheese.  As he basked in the smiles of  the girls and was patted and complimented by the old men, he had felt  growing within him the strength to do mighty deeds of arms.    After complicated journeyings with many pauses, there had come months  of monotonous life in a camp.  He had had the belief that real war was  a series of death struggles with small time in between for sleep and  meals; but since his regiment had come to the field the army had done  little but sit still and try to keep warm.    He was brought then gradually back to his old ideas.  Greeklike  struggles would be no more.  Men were better, or more timid.  Secular  and religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or  else firm finance held in check the passions.    He had grown to regard himself merely as a part of a vast blue  demonstration.  His province was to look out, as far as he could, for  his personal comfort.  For recreation he could twiddle his thumbs and  speculate on the thoughts which must agitate the minds of the generals.  Also, he was drilled and drilled and reviewed, and drilled and drilled  and reviewed.    The only foes he had seen were some pickets along the river bank.  They  were a sun-tanned, philosophical lot, who sometimes shot reflectively  at the blue pickets.  When reproached for this afterward, they usually  expressed sorrow, and swore by their gods that the guns had exploded  without their permission.  The youth, on guard duty one night,  conversed across the stream with one of them.  He was a slightly ragged  man, who spat skillfully between his shoes and possessed a great fund  of bland and infantile assurance.  The youth liked him personally.    \"Yank,\" the other had informed him, \"yer a right dum good feller.\" This  sentiment, floating to him upon the still air, had made him temporarily  regret war.    Various veterans had told him tales.  Some talked of gray, bewhiskered  hordes who were advancing with relentless curses and chewing tobacco  with unspeakable valor; tremendous bodies of fierce soldiery who were  sweeping along like the Huns.  Others spoke of tattered and eternally  hungry men who fired despondent powders.  \"They'll charge through  hell's fire an' brimstone t' git a holt on a haversack, an' sech  stomachs ain't a'lastin' long,\" he was told.  From the stories, the  youth imagined the red, live bones sticking out through slits in the  faded uniforms.    Still, he could not put a whole faith in veteran's tales, for recruits  were their prey.  They talked much of smoke, fire, and blood, but he  could not tell how much might be lies.  They persistently yelled \"Fresh  fish!\" at him, and were in no wise to be trusted.    However, he perceived now that it did not greatly matter what kind of  soldiers he was going to fight, so long as they fought, which fact no  one disputed.  There was a more serious problem.  He lay in his bunk  pondering upon it.  He tried to mathematically prove to himself that he  would not run from a battle.    Previously he had never felt obliged to wrestle too seriously with this  question.  In his life he had taken certain things for granted, never  challenging his belief in ultimate success, and bothering little about  means and roads.  But here he was confronted with a thing of moment.  It had suddenly appeared to him that perhaps in a battle he might run.  He was forced to admit that as far as war was concerned he knew nothing  of himself.    A sufficient time before he would have allowed the problem to kick its  heels at the outer portals of his mind, but now he felt compelled to  give serious attention to it.    A little panic-fear grew in his mind.  As his imagination went forward  to a fight, he saw hideous possibilities.  He contemplated the lurking  menaces of the future, and failed in an effort to see himself standing  stoutly in the midst of them.  He recalled his visions of broken-bladed  glory, but in the shadow of the impending tumult he suspected them to  be impossible pictures.    He sprang from the bunk and began to pace nervously to and fro.  \"Good  Lord, what's th' matter with me?\" he said aloud.    He felt that in this crisis his laws of life were useless.  Whatever he  had learned of himself was here of no avail.  He was an unknown  quantity.  He saw that he would again be obliged to experiment as he  had in early youth.  He must accumulate information of himself, and  meanwhile he resolved to remain close upon his guard lest those  qualities of which he knew nothing should everlastingly disgrace him.  \"Good Lord!\" he repeated in dismay.    After a time the tall soldier slid dexterously through the hole.  The  loud private followed.  They were wrangling.    \"That's all right,\" said the tall soldier as he entered.  He waved his  hand expressively.  \"You can believe me or not, jest as you like.  All  you got to do is sit down and wait as quiet as you can.  Then pretty  soon you'll find out I was right.\"    His comrade grunted stubbornly.  For a moment he seemed to be searching  for a formidable reply.  Finally he said:  \"Well, you don't know  everything in the world, do you?\"    \"Didn't say I knew everything in the world,\" retorted the other  sharply.  He began to stow various articles snugly into his knapsack.    The youth, pausing in his nervous walk, looked down at the busy figure.  \"Going to be a battle, sure, is there, Jim?\" he asked.    \"Of course there is,\" replied the tall soldier.  \"Of course there is.  You jest wait 'til to-morrow, and you'll see one of the biggest battles  ever was.  You jest wait.\"    \"Thunder!\" said the youth.    \"Oh, you'll see fighting this time, my boy, what'll be regular  out-and-out fighting,\" added the tall soldier, with the air of a man  who is about to exhibit a battle for the benefit of his friends.    \"Huh!\" said the loud one from a corner.    \"Well,\" remarked the youth, \"like as not this story'll turn out jest  like them others did.\"    \"Not much it won't,\" replied the tall soldier, exasperated.  \"Not much  it won't.  Didn't the cavalry all start this morning?\" He glared about  him.  No one denied his statement.  \"The cavalry started this morning,\"  he continued.  \"They say there ain't hardly any cavalry left in camp.  They're going to Richmond, or some place, while we fight all the  Johnnies.  It's some dodge like that.  The regiment's got orders, too.  A feller what seen 'em go to headquarters told me a little while ago.  And they're raising blazes all over camp--anybody can see that.\"    \"Shucks!\" said the loud one.    The youth remained silent for a time.  At last he spoke to the tall  soldier.  \"Jim!\"    \"What?\"    \"How do you think the reg'ment 'll do?\"    \"Oh, they'll fight all right, I guess, after they once get into it,\"  said the other with cold judgment.  He made a fine use of the third  person.  \"There's been heaps of fun poked at 'em because they're new,  of course, and all that; but they'll fight all right, I guess.\"    \"Think any of the boys 'll run?\" persisted the youth.    \"Oh, there may be a few of 'em run, but there's them kind in every  regiment, 'specially when they first goes under fire,\" said the other  in a tolerant way.  \"Of course it might happen that the hull  kit-and-boodle might start and run, if some big fighting came  first-off, and then again they might stay and fight like fun.  But you  can't bet on nothing.  Of course they ain't never been under fire yet,  and it ain't likely they'll lick the hull rebel army all-to-oncet the  first time; but I think they'll fight better than some, if worse than  others.  That's the way I figger.

Never, that is, since the days of the  ancient republics.\" Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick, who, as Secretary of the  New-England Suffrage Association, was put forward to meet all comers,  writing in July, 1895, said: \"Shall we, as a people, be true to our  principles and enfranchise woman? or, shall we drift along in the meanest  form of oligarchy known among men--an oligarchy which exalts every sort of  a male into a ruler simply because he is a male, and debases every woman  into a subject simply because she is a woman?\" Mrs. Fanny B. Ames,  speaking in Boston in 1896, said: \"I believe woman suffrage to be the  final result of the evolution of a true democracy.\" Not only has every  woman speaker or writer in favor of suffrage presented this idea in some  form, but the men also who have taken that side have done likewise. One  among those who advocated the cause before the Committee in the  Constitutional Convention of New York, said: \"Woman Suffrage is the  inevitable result of the logic of the situation of modern society. The  despot who first yielded an inch of power gave up the field. We are  standing in the light of the best interests of the State of New York when  we stand in the way of this forward movement.\"    All these writers charge the American Republic with being false to  democratic principles in excluding women from the franchise, while but one  of them alludes to the fact that in the ancient republics the same  \"anomaly\" was seen.    As I read political history, the facts go to show that the fundamental  principles of our Government are more opposed to the exercise of suffrage  by women than are those of monarchies. To me it seems that both despotism  and anarchy are more friendly to woman's political aspirations than is any  form of constitutional government, and that manhood suffrage, and not  womanhood suffrage, is the final result of the evolution of democracy.    The Suffragists repeatedly call attention to the fact that in the early  ages in Egypt, in Greece, and in Rome, women were of much greater  political consequence than later during the republics; but the moral they  have drawn has been that of the superiority of the ancient times. Mrs.  Dietrick says: \"The ideal woman of Greece was Athena, patroness of all  household arts and industries, but equally patroness of all political  interests. The greatest city of Greece was believed to have been founded  by her, and Greek history recorded that, though the men citizens voted  solidly to have the city named for Neptune, yet the women citizens voted  solidly for Athena, beat them by one vote, and carried that political  matter. If physical force had been a governing power in Greece, and men  its manifestation, how could such a story have been published by Greek men  down to the second century before our era?\"    Mrs. Dietrick's remarkably realistic version of the old myth does not tell  the tale as Greek men published it. Varro, who was educated at Athens,  goes on to say: \"Thereupon, Neptune became enraged, and immediately the  sea flowed over all the land of Athens. To appease the god, the burgesses  were compelled to impose a threefold punishment upon their wives--they  were to lose their votes; the children were to receive no more the  mother's name; and they themselves were no longer to be called Athenians,  after the goddess.\" It seems to me this fable teaches that physical force  was indeed the governing power in Athens at that day, and that men were  its manifestation.    The legend is generally taken to indicate the time when the Greek gens  progressed to the family. In the ruder time, the legitimacy of the  chieftain might be traced, because the mother, though not always the  father, could be known with certainty. When the father became the  acknowledged head of the household, a distinct advance was made toward  that heroic age in which the vague but towering figures of men and women  move across the stage. Goddesses, queens, princesses, are powerful in love  and war. Sibyls unfold the meaning of the book of fate. Vestals feed the  fires upon the highest and lowest altars. Later, throughout most of the  states of Greece, something like the following order of political life is  seen: from kings to oligarchs, from oligarchs to tyrants or despots, from  them to some form of restricted constitutional liberty. In Sparta, all  change of government was controlled by the machinery of war, and the  soldiers were made forever free. Athens, separated from the rest of  Greece, was less agitated by outward conflict. In government she passed  from king to archon; from hereditary archon to archons chosen for ten  years, but always from one family, then to those elected for one year,  nine being chosen. At the time of the Areopagus there were four classes of  citizens. The first three paid taxes, had a right to share in the  government, and formed the defence of the state. If women were of  political importance in earlier times, and if a republic is more favorable  to the exercise by them of the elective franchise, we should expect to  find women reaching their highest power under the Areopagus. Exactly the  contrary appears to be true. Native and honorable Greek women retired to  domestic life as the liberty of their people grew. Grote, in his \"History  of Greece,\" referring to the legendary period, says: \"We find the wife  occupying a station of great dignity and influence, though it was the  practice of the husband to purchase her by valuable presents to her  parents. She even seems to live less secluded, and to enjoy a wider sphere  of action, than was allotted to her in historic Greece.\"    Lecky, in his \"European Morals,\" says: \"It is one of the most remarkable  and, to some writers, one of the most perplexing facts in the moral  history of Greece, that in the former and ruder period women had  undoubtedly the highest place, and their type exhibited the highest  perfection.\" What the \"highest perfection\" is, for her type, or for man's  type, is not here under discussion; but it is not out of place to say in  passing that if the final conquest of the spiritual over the material  forces of humanity is really the aim of civilization, these \"facts in the  moral history of Greece\" become less \"perplexing.\"    The heroines of Homer's tales were all of noble birth--they were  goddesses, princesses, hereditary gentlewomen. In early historic times,  also, it was only royal or gentle blood that secured for woman political  power. Athena was, in gentle Athens, patroness of household arts; but in  Sparta, as Minerva, the same divinity was goddess, not of political  interests, as Mrs. Dietrick puts it, but of war. She sprang full-armed  from the head of Jove--rather a masculine origin, it must be owned. In  Sparta women became soldiers as the democratic idea advanced. Princess  Archidamia, marching at the head of her female troop to rebuke the  senators for the decree that the women and children be removed from the  city before the anticipated attack could come, is an example. In Etolia,  in Argos, and in other states, the same was true. Maria and Telesilla led  the women in battle and disciplined them in peace. But the world does not  turn to Sparta for its ideal of a pre-Christian republic, and the  Suffragists of our day do not propose to emulate the Spartan Amazon and  hew their way to political power with the sword.    In Athens, which does present the model, matters were far otherwise. In  the year 700 B. C., the Spartans called upon Athens for a commander to  lead them to the second Messenian war, and the Athenians sent them  Tyrtaeus, their martial poet. The Spartans were displeased at his youth  and gentle bearing; but when the battle was joined, his chanting of his  own war-songs so animated the troops that they won against heavy odds. The  following is a fragment translated from one of his lyrics:      \"But be it ours to guard the hallowed spot,       To shield the tender offspring and the wife;     Here steadily await our destined lot,       And, for their sakes, resign the gift of life.\"    Aeschylus, poet and soldier, writing a hundred and fifty years later, in  his \"Seven Against Thebes,\" puts into the mouth of the chieftain Eteocles  this address to the women:      \"It is not to be borne, ye wayward race;     Is this your best, is this the aid you lend     The state, the fortitude with which you steel     The souls of the besieged, thus falling down     Before the images to wail, and shriek     With lamentations loud? Wisdom abhors you.     Nor in misfortune, nor in dear success,     Be woman my associate. If her power     Bears sway, her insolence exceeds all bounds;     But if she fears, woe to that house and city.     And now by holding counsel with weak fear,     You magnify the foe, and turn our men     To flight. Thus are we ruined by ourselves.     This ever will arise from suffering women     To intermix with men. But mark me well,     Whoe'er henceforth dares disobey my orders--     Be it man or woman, old or young--     Vengeance shall burst upon him, the decree     Stands irreversible, and he shall die.     War is no female province, but the scene     For men. Hence, home! nor spread your mischiefs here.     Hear you, or not? Or speak I to the deaf?\"    Pericles, in his famous funeral oration over those who fell in the  Peloponnesian war, thus addresses the Athenian women: \"To the wives who  will henceforth live in widowhood, I will speak, in one short sentence  only, of womanly virtue. She is the best woman who is most truly a woman,  and her reputation is the highest whose name is never in the mouths of men  for good or for evil.\"    Seclusion was the best thing that the most intellectual pre-Christian  republic could give to its honorable women.
