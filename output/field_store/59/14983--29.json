He in the upper world can yet bestow  Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks  For life yet longer, if before the time  Grace call him not unto herself.\"  Thus spake  The teacher.  He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,  And caught my guide.  Alcides whilom felt  That grapple straighten'd score.  Soon as my guide  Had felt it, he bespake me thus:  \"This way  That I may clasp thee;\" then so caught me up,  That we were both one burden.  As appears  The tower of Carisenda, from beneath  Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud  So sail across, that opposite it hangs,  Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease  I mark'd him stooping.  I were fain at times  T' have pass'd another way.  Yet in th' abyss,  That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,  I,ightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,  But rose as in a bark the stately mast.        CANTO XXXII    COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit  That hole of sorrow, o'er which ev'ry rock  His firm abutment rears, then might the vein  Of fancy rise full springing:  but not mine  Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch  The mighty theme; for to describe the depth  Of all the universe, is no emprize  To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd  To infant babbling.  But let them assist  My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid  Amphion wall'd in Thebes, so with the truth  My speech shall best accord.  Oh ill-starr'd folk,  Beyond all others wretched!  who abide  In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words  To speak of, better had ye here on earth  Been flocks or mountain goats.  As down we stood  In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,  But lower far than they, and I did gaze  Still on the lofty battlement, a voice  Bespoke me thus:  \"Look how thou walkest.  Take  Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads  Of thy poor brethren.\"  Thereupon I turn'd,  And saw before and underneath my feet  A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd  To glass than water.  Not so thick a veil  In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread  O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote  Under the chilling sky.  Roll'd o'er that mass  Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,  Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog  Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams  The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,  So, to where modest shame appears, thus low  Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,  Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.  His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,  Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.       A space I look'd around, then at my feet  Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head  The very hairs were mingled.  \"Tell me ye,  Whose bosoms thus together press,\" said I,  \"Who are ye?\"  At that sound their necks they bent,  And when their looks were lifted up to me,  Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,  Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound  The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.  Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up  So stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats  They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.       And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,  Exclaim'd, still looking downward: \"Why on us  Dost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know  Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave  Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own  Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.  They from one body issued; and throughout  Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade  More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,  Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land  At that one blow dissever'd, not Focaccia,  No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head  Obstructs my onward view:  he bore the name  Of Mascheroni:  Tuscan if thou be,  Well knowest who he was:  and to cut short  All further question, in my form behold  What once was Camiccione.  I await  Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt  Shall wash out mine.\"  A thousand visages  Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold  Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps  A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought  Of those frore shallows.  While we journey'd on  Toward the middle, at whose point unites  All heavy substance, and I trembling went  Through that eternal chillness, I know not  If will it were or destiny, or chance,  But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike  With violent blow against the face of one.       \"Wherefore dost bruise me?\" weeping, he exclaim'd,  \"Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge  For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?\"       I thus:  \"Instructor, now await me here,  That I through him may rid me of my doubt.  Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.\"  The teacher paus'd,  And to that shade I spake, who bitterly  Still curs'd me in his wrath.  \"What art thou, speak,  That railest thus on others?\"  He replied:  \"Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks  Through Antenora roamest, with such force  As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?\"       \"And I am living, to thy joy perchance,\"  Was my reply, \"if fame be dear to thee,  That with the rest I may thy name enrol.\"       \"The contrary of what I covet most,\"  Said he, \"thou tender'st:  hence; nor vex me more.  Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.\"       Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:  \"Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.\"       \"Rend all away,\" he answer'd, \"yet for that  I will not tell nor show thee who I am,  Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times.\"       Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off  More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes  Drawn in and downward, when another cried,  \"What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough  Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?  What devil wrings thee?\"--\" Now,\" said I, \"be dumb,  Accursed traitor!  to thy shame of thee  True tidings will I bear.\"--\" Off,\" he replied,  \"Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence  To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,  Forget not:  here he wails the Frenchman's gold.  'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,  Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd  What other shade was with them, at thy side  Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd  The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,  If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,  With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him  Who op'd Faenza when the people slept.\"       We now had left him, passing on our way,  When I beheld two spirits by the ice  Pent in one hollow, that the head of one  Was cowl unto the other; and as bread  Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost  Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,  Where the spine joins it.  Not more furiously  On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,  Than on that skull and on its garbage he.       \"O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate  'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear,\" said I  \"The cause, on such condition, that if right  Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,  And what the colour of his sinning was,  I may repay thee in the world above,  If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long.\"        CANTO XXXIII    HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,  That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,  Which he behind had mangled, then began:  \"Thy will obeying, I call up afresh  Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings  My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,  That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear  Fruit of eternal infamy to him,  The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once  Shalt see me speak and weep.  Who thou mayst be  I know not, nor how here below art come:  But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,  When I do hear thee.  Know I was on earth  Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he  Ruggieri.  Why I neighbour him so close,  Now list.  That through effect of his ill thoughts  In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en  And after murder'd, need is not I tell.  What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,  How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,  And know if he have wrong'd me.  A small grate  Within that mew, which for my sake the name  Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,  Already through its opening sev'ral moons  Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,  That from the future tore the curtain off.  This one, methought, as master of the sport,  Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps  Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight  Of Lucca to the Pisan.  With lean brachs  Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd  Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.  After short course the father and the sons  Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw  The sharp tusks gore their sides.  When I awoke  Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard  My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask  For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang  Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;  And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?  Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near  When they were wont to bring us food; the mind  Of each misgave him through his dream, and I  Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up  The' horrible tower:  whence uttering not a word  I look'd upon the visage of my sons.  I wept not:  so all stone I felt within.  They wept:  and one, my little Anslem, cried:  \"Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?\"  Yet  I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day  Nor the next night, until another sun  Came out upon the world.  When a faint beam  Had to our doleful prison made its way,  And in four countenances I descry'd  The image of my own, on either hand  Through agony I bit, and they who thought  I did it through desire of feeding, rose  O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve  Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st  These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,  And do thou strip them off from us again.'  Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down  My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next  We all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!  Why open'dst not upon us?  When we came  To the fourth day, then Geddo at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#20)"],[1,"Wolf both heard the sharp crack that  followed--as if a dry stick had been stepped upon and broken. It was  February, and the hoofed animals were already beginning to shed their  horns--especially the older bulls, whose palmate growths drop first.  This fact gave victory to the younger bull in the blood-stained arena a  few yards from Gray Wolf and Kazan. From its socket in the old bull's  skull one of his huge antlers broke with that sharp snapping sound, and  in another moment four inches of stiletto-like horn buried itself back  of his foreleg. In an instant all hope and courage left him, and he  swung backward yard by yard, with the younger bull prodding his neck and  shoulders until blood dripped from him in little streams. At the edge  of the clearing he flung himself free and crashed off into the forest.    The younger bull did not pursue. He tossed his head, and stood for a few  moments with heaving sides and dilated nostrils, facing in the direction  his vanquished foe had taken. Then he turned, and trotted back to the  still motionless cows and yearling.    Kazan and Gray Wolf were quivering. Gray Wolf slunk back from the edge  of the clearing, and Kazan followed. No longer were they interested in  the cows and the young bull. From that clearing they had seen meat  driven forth--meat that was beaten in fight, and bleeding. Every  instinct of the wild pack returned to Gray Wolf now--and in Kazan the  mad desire to taste the blood he smelled. Swiftly they turned toward the  blood-stained trail of the old bull, and when they came to it they found  it spattered red. Kazan's jaws dripped as the hot scent drove the blood  like veins of fire through his weakened body. His eyes were reddened by  starvation, and in them there was a light now that they had never known  even in the days of the wolf-pack.    He set off swiftly, almost forgetful of Gray Wolf. But his mate no  longer required his flank for guidance. With her nose close to the trail  she ran--ran as she had run in the long and thrilling hunts before  blindness came. Half a mile from the spruce thicket they came upon the  old bull. He had sought shelter behind a clump of balsam, and he stood  over a growing pool of blood in the snow. He was still breathing hard.  His massive head, grotesque now with its one antler, was drooping.  Flecks of blood dropped from his distended nostrils. Even then, with the  old bull weakened by starvation, exhaustion and loss of blood, a  wolf-pack would have hung back before attacking. Where they would have  hesitated, Kazan leaped in with a snarling cry. For an instant his fangs  sunk into the thick hide of the bull's throat. Then he was flung  back--twenty feet. Hunger gnawing at his vitals robbed him of all  caution, and he sprang to the attack again--full at the bull's  front--while Gray Wolf crept up unseen behind, seeking in her blindness  the vulnerable part which nature had not taught Kazan to find.    This time Kazan was caught fairly on the broad palmate leaf of the  bull's antler, and he was flung back again, half stunned. In that same  moment Gray Wolf's long white teeth cut like knives through one of the  bull's rope-like hamstrings. For thirty seconds she kept the hold, while  the bull plunged wildly in his efforts to trample her underfoot. Kazan  was quick to learn, still quicker to be guided by Gray Wolf, and he  leaped in again, snapping for a hold on the bulging cord just above the  knee. He missed, and as he lunged forward on his shoulders Gray Wolf was  flung off. But she had accomplished her purpose. Beaten in open battle  with one of his kind, and now attacked by a still deadlier foe, the old  bull began to retreat. As he went, one hip sank under him at every step.  The tendon of his left leg was bitten half through.    Without being able to see, Gray Wolf seemed to realize what had  happened. Again she was the pack-wolf--with all the old wolf strategy.  Twice flung back by the old bull's horn, Kazan knew better than to  attack openly again. Gray Wolf trotted after the bull, but he remained  behind for a moment to lick up hungrily mouthfuls of the blood-soaked  snow. Then he followed, and ran close against Gray Wolf's side, fifty  yards behind the bull. There was more blood in the trail now--a thin red  ribbon of it. Fifteen minutes later the bull stopped again, and faced  about, his great head lowered. His eyes were red. There was a droop to  his neck and shoulders that spoke no longer of the unconquerable  fighting spirit that had been a part of him for nearly a score of years.  No longer was he lord of the wilderness about him; no longer was there  defiance in the poise of his splendid head, or the flash of eager fire  in his bloodshot eyes. His breath came with a gasping sound that was  growing more and more distinct. A hunter would have known what it meant.  The stiletto-point of the younger bull's antler had gone home, and the  old bull's lungs were failing him. More than once Gray Wolf had heard  that sound in the early days of her hunting with the pack, and she  understood. Slowly she began to circle about the wounded monarch at a  distance of about twenty yards. Kazan kept at her side.    Once--twice--twenty times they made that slow circle, and with each turn  they made the old bull turned, and his breath grew heavier and his head  drooped lower. Noon came, and was followed by the more intense cold of  the last half of the day. Twenty circles became a hundred--two  hundred--and more. Under Gray Wolf's and Kazan's feet the snow grew hard  in the path they made. Under the old bull's widespread hoofs the snow  was no longer white--but red. A thousand times before this unseen  tragedy of the wilderness had been enacted. It was an epoch of that life  where life itself means the survival of the fittest, where to live means  to kill, and to die means to perpetuate life. At last, in that steady  and deadly circling of Gray Wolf and Kazan, there came a time when the  old bull did not turn--then a second, a third and a fourth time, and  Gray Wolf seemed to know. With Kazan she drew back from the hard-beaten  trail, and they flattened themselves on their bellies under a dwarf  spruce--and waited. For many minutes the bull stood motionless, his  hamstrung quarter sinking lower and lower. And then with a deep  blood-choked gasp he sank down.    For a long time Kazan and Gray Wolf did not move, and when at last they  returned to the beaten trail the bull's heavy head was resting on the  snow. Again they began to circle, and now the circle narrowed foot by  foot, until only ten yards--then nine--then eight--separated them from  their prey. The bull attempted to rise, and failed. Gray Wolf heard the  effort. She heard him sink back and suddenly she leaped in swiftly and  silently from behind. Her sharp fangs buried themselves in the bull's  nostrils, and with the first instinct of the husky, Kazan sprang for a  throat hold. This time he was not flung off. It was Gray Wolf's terrible  hold that gave him time to tear through the half-inch hide, and to bury  his teeth deeper and deeper, until at last they reached the jugular. A  gush of warm blood spurted into his face. But he did not let go. Just as  he had held to the jugular of his first buck on that moonlight night a  long time ago, so he held to the old bull now. It was Gray Wolf who  unclamped his jaws. She drew back, sniffing the air, listening. Then,  slowly, she raised her head, and through the frozen and starving  wilderness there went her wailing triumphant cry--the call to meat.    For them the days of famine had passed.          CHAPTER XIV    THE RIGHT OF FANG      After the fight Kazan lay down exhausted in the blood-stained snow,  while faithful Gray Wolf, still filled with the endurance of her wild  wolf breed, tore fiercely at the thick skin on the bull's neck to lay  open the red flesh. When she had done this she did not eat, but ran to  Kazan's side and whined softly as she muzzled him with her nose. After  that they feasted, crouching side by side at the bull's neck and tearing  at the warm sweet flesh.    The last pale light of the northern day was fading swiftly into night  when they drew back, gorged until there were no longer hollows in their  sides. The faint wind died away. The clouds that had hung in the sky  during the day drifted eastward, and the moon shone brilliant and clear.  For an hour the night continued to grow lighter. To the brilliance of  the moon and the stars there was added now the pale fires of the aurora  borealis, shivering and flashing over the Pole.    Its hissing crackling monotone, like the creaking of steel  sledge-runners on frost-filled snow, came faintly to the ears of Kazan  and Gray Wolf.    As yet they had not gone a hundred yards from the dead bull, and at the  first sound of that strange mystery in the northern skies they stopped  and listened to it, alert and suspicious. Then they laid their ears  aslant and trotted slowly back to the meat they had killed. Instinct  told them that it was theirs only by right of fang. They had fought to  kill it. And it was in the law of the wild that they would have to fight  to keep it. In good hunting days they would have gone on and wandered  under the moon and the stars. But long days and nights of starvation had  taught them something different now.    On that clear and stormless night following the days of plague and  famine, a hundred thousand hungry creatures came out from their retreats  to hunt for food. For eighteen hundred miles east and west and a  thousand miles north and south, slim gaunt-bellied creatures hunted  under the moon and the stars. Something told Kazan and Gray Wolf that  this hunt was on, and never for an instant did they cease their  vigilance. At last they lay down at the edge of the spruce thicket, and  waited. Gray Wolf muzzled Kazan gently with her blind face. The uneasy  whine in her throat was a warning to him. Then"]]]
