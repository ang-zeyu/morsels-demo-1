There I was, by trade, a woodchopper, and  contributed my share to the comfort of the Oz people by chopping up the  trees of the forest to make firewood, with which the women would cook  their meals while the children warmed themselves about the fires. For  my home I had a little hut by the edge of the forest, and my life was  one of much content until I fell in love with a beautiful Munchkin girl  who lived not far away.\"    \"What was the Munchkin girl's name?\" asked Woot.    \"Nimmie Amee. This girl, so fair that the sunsets blushed when their  rays fell upon her, lived with a powerful witch who wore silver shoes  and who had made the poor child her slave. Nimmie Amee was obliged to  work from morning till night for the old Witch of the East, scrubbing  and sweeping her hut and cooking her meals and washing her dishes. She  had to cut firewood, too, until I found her one day in the forest and  fell in love with her. After that, I always brought plenty of firewood  to Nimmie Amee and we became very friendly. Finally I asked her to  marry me, and she agreed to do so, but the Witch happened to overhear  our conversation and it made her very angry, for she did not wish her  slave to be taken away from her. The Witch commanded me never to come  near Nimmie Amee again, but I told her I was my own master and would do  as I pleased, not realizing that this was a careless way to speak to a  Witch.    \"The next day, as I was cutting wood in the forest, the cruel Witch  enchanted my axe, so that it slipped and cut off my right leg.\"    \"How dreadful!\" cried Woot the Wanderer.    \"Yes, it was a seeming misfortune,\" agreed the Tin Man, \"for a  one-legged woodchopper is of little use in his trade. But I would not  allow the Witch to conquer me so easily. I knew a very skillful  mechanic at the other side of the forest, who was my friend, so I  hopped on one leg to him and asked him to help me. He soon made me a  new leg out of tin and fastened it cleverly to my meat body. It had  joints at the knee and at the ankle and was almost as comfortable as  the leg I had lost.\"    \"Your friend must have been a wonderful workman!\" exclaimed Woot.    \"He was, indeed,\" admitted the Emperor. \"He was a tinsmith by trade and  could make anything out of tin. When I returned to Nimmie Amee, the  girl was delighted and threw her arms around my neck and kissed me,  declaring she was proud of me. The Witch saw the kiss and was more  angry than before. When I went to work in the forest, next day, my axe,  being still enchanted, slipped and cut off my other leg. Again I  hopped--on my tin leg--to my friend the tinsmith, who kindly made me  another tin leg and fastened it to my body. So I returned joyfully to  Nimmie Amee, who was much pleased with my glittering legs and promised  that when we were wed she would always keep them oiled and polished.  But the Witch was more furious than ever, and as soon as I raised my  axe to chop, it twisted around and cut off one of my arms. The tinsmith  made me a tin arm and I was not much worried, because Nimmie Amee  declared she still loved me.\"          Chapter Two    The Heart of the Tin Woodman      The Emperor of the Winkies paused in his story to reach for an oil-can,  with which he carefully oiled the joints in his tin throat, for his  voice had begun to squeak a little. Woot the Wanderer, having satisfied  his hunger, watched this oiling process with much curiosity, but begged  the Tin Man to go on with his tale.    \"The Witch with the Silver Shoes hated me for having defied her,\"  resumed the Emperor, his voice now sounding clear as a bell, \"and she  insisted that Nimmie Amee should never marry me.  Therefore she made  the enchanted axe cut off my other arm, and the tinsmith also replaced  that member with tin, including these finely-jointed hands that you see  me using. But, alas! after that, the axe, still enchanted by the cruel  Witch, cut my body in two, so that I fell to the ground. Then the  Witch, who was watching from a near-by bush, rushed up and seized the  axe and chopped my body into several small pieces, after which,  thinking that at last she had destroyed me, she ran away laughing in  wicked glee.    \"But Nimmie Amee found me. She picked up my arms and legs and head, and  made a bundle of them and carried them to the tinsmith, who set to work  and made me a fine body of pure tin. When he had joined the arms and  legs to the body, and set my head in the tin collar, I was a much  better man than ever, for my body could not ache or pain me, and I was  so beautiful and bright that I had no need of clothing. Clothing is  always a nuisance, because it soils and tears and has to be replaced;  but my tin body only needs to be oiled and polished.    \"Nimmie Amee still declared she would marry me, as she still loved me  in spite of the Witch's evil deeds. The girl declared I would make the  brightest husband in all the world, which was quite true. However, the  Wicked Witch was not yet defeated. When I returned to my work the axe  slipped and cut off my head, which was the only meat part of me then  remaining. Moreover, the old woman grabbed up my severed head and  carried it away with her and hid it. But Nimmie Amee came into the  forest and found me wandering around helplessly, because I could not  see where to go, and she led me to my friend the tinsmith. The faithful  fellow at once set to work to make me a tin head, and he had just  completed it when Nimmie Amee came running up with my old head, which  she had stolen from the Witch. But, on reflection, I considered the tin  head far superior to the meat one--I am wearing it yet, so you can see  its beauty and grace of outline--and the girl agreed with me that a man  all made of tin was far more perfect than one formed of different  materials. The tinsmith was as proud of his workmanship as I was, and  for three whole days, all admired me and praised my beauty. Being now  completely formed of tin, I had no more fear of the Wicked Witch, for  she was powerless to injure me. Nimmie Amee said we must be married at  once, for then she could come to my cottage and live with me and keep  me bright and sparkling.    \"'I am sure, my dear Nick,' said the brave and beautiful girl--my name  was then Nick Chopper, you should be told--'that you will make the best  husband any girl could have. I shall not be obliged to cook for you,  for now you do not eat; I shall not have to make your bed, for tin does  not tire or require sleep; when we go to a dance, you will not get  weary before the music stops and say you want to go home. All day long,  while you are chopping wood in the forest, I shall be able to amuse  myself in my own way--a privilege few wives enjoy. There is no temper  in your new head, so you will not get angry with me. Finally, I shall  take pride in being the wife of the only live Tin Woodman in all the  world!' Which shows that Nimmie Amee was as wise as she was brave and  beautiful.\"    \"I think she was a very nice girl,\" said Woot the Wanderer. \"But, tell  me, please, why were you not killed when you were chopped to pieces?\"    \"In the Land of Oz,\" replied the Emperor, \"no one can ever be killed. A  man with a wooden leg or a tin leg is still the same man; and, as I  lost parts of my meat body by degrees, I always remained the same  person as in the beginning, even though in the end I was all tin and no  meat.\"    \"I see,\" said the boy, thoughtfully. \"And did you marry Nimmie Amee?\"    \"No,\" answered the Tin Woodman, \"I did not. She said she still loved  me, but I found that I no longer loved her. My tin body contained no  heart, and without a heart no one can love. So the Wicked Witch  conquered in the end, and when I left the Munchkin Country of Oz, the  poor girl was still the slave of the Witch and had to do her bidding  day and night.\"    \"Where did you go?\" asked Woot.    \"Well, I first started out to find a heart, so I could love Nimmie Amee  again; but hearts are more scarce than one would think. One day, in a  big forest that was strange to me, my joints suddenly became rusted,  because I had forgotten to oil them. There I stood, unable to move hand  or foot. And there I continued to stand--while days came and  went--until Dorothy and the Scarecrow came along and rescued me. They  oiled my joints and set me free, and I've taken good care never to rust  again.\"    \"Who was this Dorothy?\" questioned the Wanderer.    \"A little girl who happened to be in a house when it was carried by a  cyclone all the way from Kansas to the Land of Oz. When the house fell,  in the Munchkin Country, it fortunately landed on the Wicked Witch and  smashed her flat. It was a big house, and I think the Witch is under it  yet.\"    \"No,\" said the Scarecrow, correcting him, \"Dorothy says the Witch  turned to dust, and the wind scattered the dust in every direction.\"    \"Well,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"after meeting the Scarecrow and  Dorothy, I went with them to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz  gave me a heart. But the Wizard's stock of hearts was low, and he gave  me a Kind Heart instead of a Loving Heart, so that I could not love  Nimmie Amee any more than I did when I was heartless.\"    \"Couldn't the Wizard give you a heart that was both Kind and Loving?\"  asked the boy.    \"No; that was what I asked for, but he said he was so short on hearts,  just then, that there was but one in stock, and I could take that or  none at all. So I accepted it, and I must say that for its kind it is a  very good heart indeed.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said Woot, musingly, \"that the Wizard fooled you. It  can't be a very Kind Heart, you know.\"    \"Why not?\" demanded the Emperor.    \"Because it was unkind of you to desert the girl who loved you, and who  had been faithful and true to you when you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#2)"],[1,"of the existence of the  Flatheads and the Skeezers, through my Book of Records, you would never  have worried about them or their quarrels. So, if you pay no attention  to these peoples, you may never hear of them again.\"    \"But that wouldn't be right,\" declared Ozma. \"I am Ruler of all the  Land of Oz, which includes the Gillikin Country, the Quadling Country,  the Winkie Country and the Munchkin Country, as well as the Emerald  City, and being the Princess of this fairyland it is my duty to make  all my people--wherever they may be--happy and content and to settle  their disputes and keep them from quarreling. So, while the Skeezers  and Flatheads may not know me or that I am their lawful Ruler, I now  know that they inhabit my kingdom and are my subjects, so I would not  be doing my duty if I kept away from them and allowed them to fight.\"    \"That's  a  fact,  Ozma,\"  commented  Dorothy. \"You've got to go up to  the Gillikin Country and make these people behave themselves and make  up their quarrels. But how are you going to do it?\"    \"That is what is puzzling me also, your Majesty,\" said the Sorceress.  \"It may be dangerous for you to go into those strange countries, where  the people are possibly fierce and warlike.\"    \"I am not afraid,\" said Ozma, with a smile.    \"'Tisn't a question of being 'fraid,\" argued Dorothy. \"Of course we  know you're a fairy, and can't be killed or hurt, and we know you've a  lot of magic of your own to help you. But, Ozma dear, in spite of all  this you've been in trouble before, on account of wicked enemies, and  it isn't right for the Ruler of all Oz to put herself in danger.\"    \"Perhaps I shall be in no danger at all,\" returned Ozma, with a little  laugh. \"You mustn't imagine danger, Dorothy, for one should only  imagine nice things, and we do not know that the Skeezers and Flatheads  are wicked people or my enemies. Perhaps they would be good and listen  to reason.\"    \"Dorothy is right, your Majesty,\" asserted the Sorceress. \"It is true  we know nothing of these faraway subjects, except that they intend to  fight one another, and have a certain amount of magic power at their  command. Such folks do not like to submit to interference and they are  more likely to resent your coming among them than to receive you kindly  and graciously, as is your due.\"    \"If you had an army to take with you,\" added Dorothy, \"it wouldn't be  so bad; but there isn't such a thing as an army in all Oz.\"    \"I have one soldier,\" said Ozma.    \"Yes, the soldier with the green whiskers; but he's dreadful 'fraid of  his gun and never loads it. I'm sure he'd run rather than fight. And  one soldier, even if he were brave, couldn't do much against two  hundred and one Flatheads and Skeezers.\"    \"What then, my friends, would you suggest?\" inquired Ozma.    \"I advise you to send the Wizard of Oz to them, and let him inform them  that it is against the laws of Oz to fight, and that you command them  to settle their differences and become friends,\" proposed Glinda. \"Let  the Wizard tell them they will be punished if they refuse to obey the  commands of the Princess of all the Land of Oz.\"    Ozma shook her head, to indicate that the advice was not to her  satisfaction.    \"If they refuse, what then?\" she asked. \"I should be obliged to carry  out my threat and punish them, and that would be an unpleasant and  difficult thing to do. I am sure it would be better for me to go  peacefully, without an army and armed only with my authority as Ruler,  and plead with them to obey me. Then, if they prove obstinate I could  resort to other means to win their obedience.\"    \"It's a ticklish thing, anyhow you look at it,\" sighed Dorothy. \"I'm  sorry now that I noticed the Record in the Great Book.\"    \"But can't you realize, my dear, that I must do my duty, now that I am  aware of this trouble?\" asked Ozma. \"I am fully determined to go at  once to the Magic Isle of the Skeezers and to the enchanted mountain of  the Flatheads, and prevent war and strife between their inhabitants.  The only question to decide is whether it is better for me to go alone,  or to assemble a party of my friends and loyal supporters to accompany  me.\"    \"If you go I want to go, too,\" declared Dorothy. \"Whatever happens it's  going to be fun--'cause all excitement is fun--and I wouldn't miss it  for the world!\"    Neither Ozma nor Glinda paid any attention to this statement, for they  were gravely considering the serious aspect of this proposed adventure.    \"There are plenty of friends who would like to go with you,\" said the  Sorceress, \"but none of them would afford your Majesty any protection  in case you were in danger. You are yourself the most powerful fairy in  Oz, although both I and the Wizard have more varied arts of magic at  our command. However, you have one art that no other in all the world  can equal--the art of winning hearts and making people love to bow to  your gracious presence. For that reason I believe you can accomplish  more good alone than with a large number of subjects in your train.\"    \"I believe that also,\" agreed the Princess. \"I shall be quite able to  take care of myself, you know, but might not be able to protect others  so well. I do not look for opposition, however. I shall speak to these  people in kindly words and settle their dispute--whatever it may be--in  a just manner.\"    \"Aren't you going to take me?\" pleaded Dorothy. \"You'll need some  companion, Ozma.\"    The Princess smiled upon her little friend.    \"I see no reason why you should not accompany me,\" was her reply. \"Two  girls are not very warlike and they will not suspect us of being on any  errand but a kindly and peaceful one. But, in order to prevent war and  strife between these angry peoples, we must go to them at once. Let us  return immediately to the Emerald City and prepare to start on our  journey early tomorrow morning.\"    Glinda was not quite satisfied with this plan, but could not think of  any better way to meet the problem. She knew that Ozma, with all her  gentleness and sweet disposition, was accustomed to abide by any  decision she had made and could not easily be turned from her purpose.  Moreover she could see no great danger to the fairy Ruler of Oz in the  undertaking, even though the unknown people she was to visit proved  obstinate. But Dorothy was not a fairy; she was a little girl who had  come from Kansas to live in the Land of Oz. Dorothy might encounter  dangers that to Ozma would be as nothing but to an \"Earth child\" would  be very serious.    The very fact that Dorothy lived in Oz, and had been made a Princess by  her friend Ozma, prevented her from being killed or suffering any great  bodily pain as long as she lived in that fairyland. She could not grow  big, either, and would always remain the same little girl who had come  to Oz, unless in some way she left that fairyland or was spirited away  from it. But Dorothy was a mortal, nevertheless, and might possibly be  destroyed, or hidden where none of her friends could ever find her. She  could, for instance be cut into pieces, and the pieces, while still  alive and free from pain, could be widely scattered; or she might be  buried deep underground or \"destroyed\" in other ways by evil magicians,  were she not properly protected. These facts Glinda was considering  while she paced with stately tread her marble hall.    Finally the good Sorceress paused and drew a ring from her finger,  handing it to Dorothy.    \"Wear this ring constantly until your return,\" she said to the girl.  \"If serious danger threatens you, turn the ring around on your finger  once to the right and another turn to the left. That will ring the  alarm bell in my palace and I will at once come to your rescue. But do  not use the ring unless you are actually in danger of destruction.  While you remain with Princess Ozma I believe she will be able to  protect you from all lesser ills.\"    \"Thank you, Glinda,\" responded Dorothy gratefully, as she placed the  ring on her finger. \"I'm going to wear my Magic Belt which I took from  the Nome King, too, so I guess I'll be safe from anything the Skeezers  and Flatheads try to do to me.\"    Ozma had many arrangements to make before she could leave her throne  and her palace in the Emerald City, even for a trip of a few days, so  she bade goodbye to Glinda and with Dorothy climbed into the Red Wagon.  A word to the wooden Sawhorse started that astonishing creature on the  return journey, and so swiftly did he run that Dorothy was unable to  talk or do anything but hold tight to her seat all the way back to the  Emerald City.          Chapter Two    Ozma and Dorothy      Residing in Ozma's palace at this time was a live Scarecrow, a most  remarkable and intelligent creature who had once ruled the Land of Oz  for a brief period and was much loved and respected by all the people.  Once a Munchkin farmer had stuffed an old suit of clothes with straw  and put stuffed boots on the feet and used a pair of stuffed cotton  gloves for hands. The head of the Scarecrow was a stuffed sack fastened  to the body, with eyes, nose, mouth and ears painted on the sack. When  a hat had been put on the head, the thing was a good imitation of a  man. The farmer placed the Scarecrow on a pole in his cornfield and it  came to life in a curious manner. Dorothy, who was passing by the  field, was hailed by the live Scarecrow and lifted him off his pole. He  then went with her to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz gave him  some excellent brains, and the Scarecrow soon became an important  personage.    Ozma considered the Scarecrow one of her best friends and most loyal  subjects, so the morning after her visit to Glinda she asked him to  take her place as Ruler of the Land of Oz while she was absent on a  journey, and the Scarecrow at once consented without asking any  questions.    Ozma had warned Dorothy to keep their journey a secret and say nothing  to"]]]
