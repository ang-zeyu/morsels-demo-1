NOTE    This book is not intended to be an historical novel, nor are its  characters meant to be identified with well-known persons connected with  the history of England or of Egypt; but all that is essential in the  tale is based upon, and drawn from, the life of both countries. Though  Egypt has greatly changed during the past generation, away from Cairo  and the commercial centres the wheels of social progress have turned but  slowly, and much remains as it was in the days of which this book is a  record in the spirit of the life, at least.                           G. P.           \"Dost thou spread the sail, throw the spear, swing the axe, lay       thy hand upon the plough, attend the furnace door, shepherd the       sheep upon the hills, gather corn from the field, or smite the       rock in the quarry? Yet, whatever thy task, thou art even as       one who twists the thread and throws the shuttle, weaving the       web of Life. Ye are all weavers, and Allah the Merciful, does       He not watch beside the loom?\"          CHAPTER I. AS THE SPIRIT MOVED    The village lay in a valley which had been the bed of a great river in  the far-off days when Ireland, Wales and Brittany were joined together  and the Thames flowed into the Seine. The place had never known turmoil  or stir. For generations it had lived serenely.    Three buildings in the village stood out insistently, more by the  authority of their appearance and position than by their size. One was a  square, red-brick mansion in the centre of the village, surrounded by a  high, redbrick wall enclosing a garden. Another was a big, low, graceful  building with wings. It had once been a monastery. It was covered  with ivy, which grew thick and hungry upon it, and it was called the  Cloistered House. The last of the three was of wood, and of no great  size--a severely plain but dignified structure, looking like some  council-hall of a past era. Its heavy oak doors and windows with  diamond panes, and its air of order, cleanliness and serenity, gave it  a commanding influence in the picture. It was the key to the history of  the village--a Quaker Meeting-house.    Involuntarily the village had built itself in such a way that it made  a wide avenue from the common at one end to the Meeting-house on the  gorse-grown upland at the other. With a demure resistance to the will  of its makers the village had made itself decorative. The people were  unconscious of any attractiveness in themselves or in their village.  There were, however, a few who felt the beauty stirring around them.  These few, for their knowledge and for the pleasure which it brought,  paid the accustomed price. The records of their lives were the only  notable history of the place since the days when their forefathers  suffered for the faith.    One of these was a girl--for she was still but a child when she died;  and she had lived in the Red Mansion with the tall porch, the wide  garden behind, and the wall of apricots and peaches and clustering  grapes. Her story was not to cease when she was laid away in the stiff  graveyard behind the Meeting-house. It was to go on in the life of her  son, whom to bring into the world she had suffered undeserved, and loved  with a passion more in keeping with the beauty of the vale in which she  lived than with the piety found on the high-backed seats in the Quaker  Meeting-house. The name given her on the register of death was Mercy  Claridge, and a line beneath said that she was the daughter of Luke  Claridge, that her age at passing was nineteen years, and that \"her soul  was with the Lord.\"    Another whose life had given pages to the village history was one of  noble birth, the Earl of Eglington. He had died twenty years after the  time when Luke Claridge, against the then custom of the Quakers, set up  a tombstone to Mercy Claridge's memory behind the Meeting-house. Only  thrice in those twenty years had he slept in a room of the Cloistered  House. One of those occasions was the day on which Luke Claridge put up  the grey stone in the graveyard, three years after his daughter's death.  On the night of that day these two men met face to face in the garden of  the Cloistered House. It was said by a passer-by, who had involuntarily  overheard, that Luke Claridge had used harsh and profane words to Lord  Eglington, though he had no inkling of the subject of the bitter talk.  He supposed, however, that Luke had gone to reprove the other for a  wasteful and wandering existence; for desertion of that Quaker religion  to which his grandfather, the third Earl of Eglington, had turned in  the second half of his life, never visiting his estates in Ireland, and  residing here among his new friends to his last day. This listener--John  Fairley was his name--kept his own counsel. On two other occasions had  Lord Eglington visited the Cloistered House in the years that passed,  and remained many months. Once he brought his wife and child. The former  was a cold, blue-eyed Saxon of an old family, who smiled distantly upon  the Quaker village; the latter, a round-headed, warm-faced youth, with a  bold, menacing eye, who probed into this and that, rushed here and there  as did his father; now built a miniature mill; now experimented at some  peril in the laboratory which had been arranged in the Cloistered House  for scientific experiments; now shot partridges in the fields where  partridges had not been shot for years; and was as little in the picture  as his adventurous father, though he wore a broad-brimmed hat, smiling  the while at the pain it gave to the simple folk around him.    And yet once more the owner of the Cloistered House returned alone. The  blue-eyed lady was gone to her grave; the youth was abroad. This time  he came to die. He was found lying on the floor of his laboratory with  a broken retort in fragments beside him. With his servant, Luke  Claridge was the first to look upon him lying in the wreck of his last  experiment, a spirit-lamp still burning above him, in the grey light  of a winter's morning. Luke Claridge closed the eyes, straightened  the body, and crossed the hands over the breast which had been the  laboratory of many conflicting passions of life.    The dead man had left instructions that his body should be buried in the  Quaker graveyard, but Luke Claridge and the Elders prevented that--he  had no right to the privileges of a Friend; and, as the only son was  afar, and no near relatives pressed the late Earl's wishes, the ancient  family tomb in Ireland received all that was left of the owner of the  Cloistered House, which, with the estates in Ireland and the title,  passed to the wandering son.          CHAPTER II. THE GATES OF THE WORLD    Stillness in the Meeting-house, save for the light swish of one  graveyard-tree against the window-pane, and the slow breathing of the  Quaker folk who filled every corner. On the long bench at the upper  end of the room the Elders sat motionless, their hands on their knees,  wearing their hats; the women in their poke-bonnets kept their gaze upon  their laps. The heads of all save three were averted, and they were  Luke Claridge, his only living daughter, called Faith, and his dead  daughter's son David, who kept his eyes fixed on the window where the  twig flicked against the pane. The eyes of Faith, who sat on a bench at  one side, travelled from David to her father constantly; and if, once or  twice, the plain rebuke of Luke Claridge's look compelled her eyes  upon her folded hands, still she was watchful and waiting, and seemed  demurely to defy the convention of unblinking silence. As time went on,  others of her sex stole glances at Mercy's son from the depths of their  bonnets; and at last, after over an hour, they and all were drawn to  look steadily at the young man upon whose business this Meeting of  Discipline had been called. The air grew warmer and warmer, but no one  became restless; all seemed as cool of face and body as the grey gowns  and coats with grey steel buttons which they wore.    At last a shrill voice broke the stillness. Raising his head, one of the  Elders said: \"Thee will stand up, friend.\" He looked at David.    With a slight gesture of relief the young man stood up. He was good  to look at-clean-shaven, broad of brow, fine of figure, composed of  carriage, though it was not the composure of the people by whom he was  surrounded. They were dignified, he was graceful; they were consistently  slow of movement, but at times his quick gestures showed that he had  not been able to train his spirit to that passiveness by which he  lived surrounded. Their eyes were slow and quiet, more meditative than  observant; his were changeful in expression, now abstracted, now dark  and shining as though some inner fire was burning. The head, too, had  a habit of coming up quickly with an almost wilful gesture, and with an  air which, in others, might have been called pride.    \"What is thy name?\" said another owl-like Elder to him.    A gentle, half-amused smile flickered at the young man's lips for an  instant, then, \"David Claridge--still,\" he answered.    His last word stirred the meeting. A sort of ruffle went through the  atmosphere, and now every eye was fixed and inquiring. The word was  ominous. He was there on his trial, and for discipline; and it was  thought by all that, as many days had passed since his offence was  committed, meditation and prayer should have done their work. Now,  however, in the tone of his voice, as it clothed the last word, there  was something of defiance. On the ear of his grandfather, Luke Claridge,  it fell heavily. The old man's lips closed tightly, he clasped his hands  between his knees with apparent self-repression.    The second Elder who had spoken was he who had once heard Luke Claridge"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#2)"],[1,"y, music,  optics, and architecture, another. There are advancements to numbers,  anatomy, architecture, astronomy, little suspected at first, when, by  union with intellect and will, they ascend into the life, and re-appear  in conversation, character and politics.    But this comes later. We speak now only of our acquaintance with them  in their own sphere, and the way in which they seem to fascinate and  draw to them some genius who occupies himself with one thing, all his  life long. The possibility of interpretation lies in the identity of  the observer with the observed. Each material thing has its celestial  side; has its translation, through humanity, into the spiritual and  necessary sphere, where it plays a part as indestructible as any other.  And to these, their ends, all things continually ascend. The gases  gather to the solid firmament; the chemic lump arrives at the plant,  and grows; arrives at the quadruped, and walks; arrives at the man,  and thinks. But also the constituency determines the vote of the  representative. He is not only representative, but participant. Like  can only be known by like. The reason why he knows about them is, that  he is of them; he has just come out of nature, or from being a part  of that thing. Animated chlorine knows of chlorine, and incarnate zinc,  of zinc. Their quality makes this career; and he can variously publish  their virtues, because they compose him. Man, made of the dust of the  world, does not forget his origin; and all that is yet inanimate will  one day speak and reason. Unpublished nature will have its whole secret  told. Shall we say that quartz mountains will pulverize into innumerable  Werners, Von Buchs, and Beaumonts; and the laboratory of the atmosphere  holds in solution I know not what Berzeliuses and Davys?    Thus, we sit by the fire, and take hold on the poles of the earth.  This quasi omnipresence supplies the imbecility of our condition. In  one of those celestial days, when heaven and earth meet and adorn each  other, it seems a poverty that we can only spend it once; we wish for  a thousand heads, a thousand bodies, that we might celebrate its immense  beauty in many ways and places. Is this fancy? Well, in good faith,  we are multiplied by our proxies. How easily we adopt their labors!  Every ship that comes to America got its chart from Columbus. Every  novel is debtor to Homer. Every carpenter who shaves with a foreplane  borrows the genius of a forgotten inventor. Life is girt all around  with a zodiac of sciences, the contributions of men who have perished  to add their point of light to our sky. Engineer, broker, jurist,  physician, moralist, theologian, and every man, inasmuch as he has any  science, is a definer and map-maker of the latitudes and longitudes  of our condition. These road-makers on every hand enrich us. We must  extend the area of life, and multiply our relations. We are as much  gainers by finding a new property in the old earth, as by acquiring  a new planet.    We are too passive in the reception of these material or semi-material  aids. We must not be sacks and stomachs. To ascend one step,--we are  better served through our sympathy. Activity is contagious. Looking  where others look, and conversing with the same things, we catch the  charm which lured them. Napoleon said, \"you must not fight too often  with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.\" Talk much  with any man of vigorous mind, and we acquire very fast the habit of  looking at things in the same light, and, on each occurrence, we  anticipate his thought.    Men are helpful through the intellect and the affections. Other help,  I find a false appearance. If you affect to give me bread and fire,  I perceive that I pay for it the full price, and at last it leaves me  as it found me, neither better nor worse: but all mental and moral  force is a positive good. It goes out from you whether you will or  not, and profits me whom you never thought of. I cannot even hear of  personal vigor of any kind, great power of performance, without fresh  resolution. We are emulous of all that man can do. Cecil's saying of  Sir Walter Raleigh, \"I know that he can toil terribly,\" is an electric  touch. So are Clarendon's portraits,--of Hampden; \"who was of an  industry and vigilance not to be tired out or wearied by the most  laborious, and of parts not to be imposed on by the most subtle and  sharp, and of a personal courage equal to his best parts\"--of Falkland;  \"who was so severe an adorer of truth, that he could as easily have  given himself leave to steal, as to dissemble.\" We cannot read Plutarch,  without a tingling of the blood; and I accept the saying of the Chinese  Mencius: \"As age is the instructor of a hundred ages. When the manners  of Loo are heard of, the stupid become intelligent, and the wavering,  determined.\"    This is the moral of biography; yet it is hard for departed men to  touch the quick like our own companions, whose names may not last as  long. What is he whom I never think of? whilst in every solitude are  those who succor our genius, and stimulate us in wonderful manners.  There is a power in love to divine another's destiny better than that  other can, and by heroic encouragements, hold him to his task. What  has friendship so signaled as its sublime attraction to whatever virtue  is in us? We will never more think cheaply of ourselves, or of life.  We are piqued to some purpose, and the industry of the diggers on the  railroad will not again shame us.    Under this head, too, falls that homage, very pure, as I think, which  all ranks pay to the hero of the day, from Coriolanus and Gracchus,  down to Pitt, Lafayette, Wellington, Webster, Lamartine. Hear the  shouts in the street! The people cannot see him enough. They delight  in a man. Here is a head and a trunk! What a front! What eyes! Atlantean  shoulders, and the whole carriage heroic, with equal inward force to  guide the great machine! This pleasure of full expression to that  which, in their private experience, is usually cramped and obstructed,  runs, also, much higher, and is the secret of the reader's joy in  literary genius. Nothing is kept back. There is fire enough to fuse  the mountain of ore. Shakspeare's principal merit may be conveyed, in  saying that he, of all men, best understands the English language, and  can say what he will. Yet these unchoked channels and floodgates of  expression are only health or fortunate constitution. Shakspeare's  name suggests other and purely intellectual benefits.    Senates and sovereigns have no compliment, with their medals, swords,  and armorial coats, like the addressing to a human being thoughts out  of a certain height, and presupposing his intelligence. This honor,  which is possible in personal intercourse scarcely twice in a lifetime,  genius perpetually pays; contented, if now and then, in a century, the  proffer is accepted. The indicators of the values of matter are degraded  to a sort of cooks and confectioners, on the appearance of the  indicators of ideas. Genius is the naturalist or geographer of the  supersensible regions, and draws on their map; and, by acquainting us  with new fields of activity, cools our affection for the old. These  are at once accepted as the reality, of which the world we have  conversed with is the show.    We go to the gymnasium and the swimming-school to see the power and  beauty of the body; there is the like pleasure, and a higher benefit,  from witnessing intellectual feats of all kinds; as, feats of memory,  of mathematical combination, great power of abstraction, the  transmutings of the imagination, even versatility, and concentration,  as these acts expose the invisible organs and members of the mind,  which respond, member for member, to the parts of the body. For, we  thus enter a new gymnasium, and learn to choose men by their truest  marks, taught, with Plato, \"to choose those who can, without aid from  the eyes, or any other sense, proceed to truth and to being.\" Foremost  among these activities, are the summersaults, spells, and resurrections,  wrought by the imagination. When this wakes, a man seems to multiply  ten times or a thousand times his force. It opens the delicious sense  of indeterminate size, and inspires an audacious mental habit. We are  as elastic as the gas of gunpowder, and a sentence in a book, or a  word dropped in conversation, sets free our fancy, and instantly our  heads are bathed with galaxies, and our feet tread the floor of the  Pit. And this benefit is real, because we are entitled to these  enlargements, and, once having passed the bounds, shall never again  be quite the miserable pedants we were.    The high functions of the intellect are so allied, that some imaginative  power usually appears in all eminent minds, even in arithmeticians of  the first class, but especially in meditative men of an intuitive habit  of thought. This class serve us, so that they have the perception of  identity and the perception of reaction. The eyes of Plato, Shakespeare,  Swedenborg, Goethe, never shut on either of these laws. The perception  of these laws is a kind of metre of the mind. Little minds are little,  through failure to see them.    Even these feasts have their surfeit. Our delight in reason degenerates  into idolatry of the herald. Especially when a mind of powerful method  has instructed men, we find the examples of oppression. The dominion  of Aristotle, the Ptolemaic astronomy, the credit of Luther, of Bacon,  of Locke,--in religion the history of hierarchies, of saints, and the  sects which have taken the name of each founder, are in point. Alas!  every man is such a victim. The imbecility of men is always inviting  the impudence of power. It is the delight of vulgar talent to dazzle  and to bind the beholder. But true genius seeks to defend us from  itself. True genius will not impoverish, but will liberate, and add  new"]]]
