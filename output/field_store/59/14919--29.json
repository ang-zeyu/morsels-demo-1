Mr. Webster, no doubt, had the best command of language of any American  author prior to our day. Those who have read his ponderous but rather  disconnected romance known as \"Websters Unabridged Dictionary, or How One  Word Led on to Another.\" will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never  lacked for a word by which to express himself. He was a brainy man and a  good speller.    It would ill become me at this late day to criticise Mr. Webster's great  work--a work that is now in almost every library, school-room and counting  house in the land. It is a great book. I do believe that had Mr. Webster  lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.    I hate to compare my own works with those of Mr. Webster, because it may  seem egotistical in me to point out the good points in my literary labors;  but I have often heard it said, and so do not state it solely upon my own  responsibility, that Mr. Webster's book does not retain the interest of  the reader all the way through.    He has tried to introduce too many characters, and so we cannot follow  them all the way through. It is a good book to pick up and while away an  idle hour with, perhaps, but no one would cling to it at night till the  fire went out, chained to the thrilling plot and the glowing career of its  hero.    Therein consists the great difference between Mr. Webster and myself. A  friend of mine at Sing Sing once wrote me that from the moment he got hold  of my book, he never left his room till he finished it. He seemed chained  to the spot, he said, and if you can't believe a convict, who is entirely  out of politics, who in the name of George Washington can you believe?    Mr. Webster was most assuredly a brilliant writer, and I have discovered  in his later editions 118,000 words, no two of which are alike. This shows  great fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The  reader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author's wonderful word  painting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome. I had heard so much of  Mr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is  cold, methodical and dispassionate in the extreme.    As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of  whiling away an idle moment, and no one should start out on a long journey  without Mr. Webster's tale in his pocket. It has broken the monotony of  many a tedious trip for me.    Mr. Webster's \"Speller\" was a work of less pretentions, perhaps, and yet  it had an immense sale. Eight years ago this book had reached a sale of  40,000,000, and yet it had the same grave defect. It was disconnected,  cold, prosy and dull. I read it for years, and at last became a close  student of Mr. Webster's style, yet I never found but one thing in this  book, for which there seems to have been such a perfect stampede, that was  even ordinarily interesting, and that was a little gem. It was so  thrilling in its details, and so diametrically different from Mr.  Webster's style, that I have often wondered who he got to write it for  him. It related to the discovery of a boy by an elderly gentleman, in the  crotch of an ancestral apple tree, and the feeling of bitterness and  animosity that sprung up at the time between the boy and the elderly  gentleman.    Though I have been a close student of Mr. Webster for years, I am free to  say, and I do not wish to do an injustice to a great man in doing so, that  his ideas of literature and my own are entirely dissimilar. Possibly his  book has had a little larger sale than mine, but that makes no difference.  When I write a book it must engage the interest of the reader, and show  some plot to it. It must not be jerky in its style and scattering in its  statements.    I know it is a great temptation to write a book that will sell, but we  should have a higher object than that.    I do not wish to do an injustice to a man who has done so much for the  world, and one who could spell the longest word without hesitation, but I  speak of these things just as I would expect people to criticise my work.  If we aspire to monkey with the literati of our day we must expect to be  criticised. That's the way I look at it.    P.S.--I might also state that Noah Webster was a member of the  Legislature of Massachusetts at one time, and though I ought not to throw  it up to him at this date, I think it is nothing more than right that the  public should know the truth.          To Her Majesty.    To Queen Victoria, Regina Dei Gracia and acting mother-in-law on the side:    Dear Madame.--Your most gracious majesty will no doubt be surprised to hear  from me after my long silence. One reason that I have not written for some  time is that I had hoped to see you ere this, and not because I had grown  cold. I desire to congratulate you at this time upon your great success as  a mother-in-law, and your very exemplary career socially. As a queen you  have given universal satisfaction, and your family have married well.    [Illustration: ADVERTISING THE ENTERPRISE.]    But I desired more especially to write you in relation to another matter.  We are struggling here in America to establish an authors' international  copyright arrangement, whereby the authors of all civilized nations may be  protected in their rights to the profits of their literary labor, and the  movement so far has met with generous encouragement. As an author we  desire your aid and endorsement. Could you assist us? We are giving this  season a series of authors' readings in New York to aid in prosecuting the  work, and we would like to know whether we could not depend upon you to  take a part in these readings, rendering selections from your late work.    I assure your most gracious majesty that you would meet some of our best  literary people while here, and no pains would be spared to make your  visit a pleasant one, aside from the reading itself. We would advertise  your appearance extensively and get out a first-class audience on the  occasion of your debut here.    [Illustration: QUEEN VIC. READING.]    An effort would be made to provide passes for yourself, and reduced rates,  I think, could be secured for yourself and suite at the hotels. Of course  you could do as you thought best about bringing suite, however. Some of  us travel with our suites and some do not. I generally leave my suite at  home, myself.    You would not need to make any special change as to costume for the  occasion. We try to make it informal, so far as possible, and though some  of us wear full dress we do not make that obligatory on those who take a  part in the exercises. If you decide to wear your every-day reigning  clothes it will not excite comment on the part of our literati. We do not  judge an author or authoress by his or her clothes.    You will readily see that this will afford you an opportunity to appear  before some of the best people of New York, and at the same time you will  aid in a deserving enterprise.    It will also promote the sale of your book.    Perhaps you have all the royalty you want aside from what you may receive  from the sale of your works, but every author feels a pardonable pride in  getting his books into every household.    I would assure your most gracious majesty that your reception here as an  authoress will in no way suffer because you are an unnaturalized  foreigner. Any alien who feels a fraternal interest in the international  advancement of thought and the universal encouragement of the good, the  true and the beautiful in literature, will be welcome on these shores.    This is a broad land, and we aim to be a broad and cosmopolitan people.  Literature and free, willing genius are not hemmed in by State or national  linos. They sprout up and blossom under tropical skies no less than  beneath the frigid aurora borealis of the frozen North. We hail true merit  just as heartily and uproariously on a throne as we would anywhere else.  In fact, it is more deserving, if possible, for one who has never tried it  little knows how difficult it is to sit on a hard throne all day and write  well. We are to recognize struggling genius wherever it may crop out. It  is no small matter for an almost unknown monarch to reign all day and then  write an article for the press or a chapter for a serial story, only,  perhaps, to have it returned by the publishers. All these things are  drawbacks to a literary life, that we here in America know little of.    I hope your most gracious majesty will decide to come, and that you will  pardon this long letter. It will do you good to get out this way for a few  weeks, and I earnestly hope that you will decide to lock up the house and  come prepared to make quite a visit. We have some real good authors here  now in America, and we are not ashamed to show them to any one. They are  not only smart, but they are well behaved and know how to appear in  company. We generally read selections from our own works, and can have a  brass band to play between the selections, if thought best. For myself, I  prefer to have a full brass band accompany me while I read. The audience  also approves of this plan.    [Illustration: THE ACCOMPANIMENT.]    We have been having some very hot weather here for the past week, but it is  now cooler. Farmers are getting in their crops in good shape, but wheat is  still low in price, and cranberries are souring on the vines. All of our  canned red raspberries worked last week, and we had to can them over  again. Mr. Riel, who went into the rebellion business in Canada last  winter, will be hanged in September if it don't rain. It will be his first  appearance on the gallows, and quite a number of our leading American  criminals are going over to see his debut.    Hoping to hear from you by return mail or prepaid cablegram, I beg leave  to remain your most gracious and indulgent majesty's "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/825"],[0,"Latin Vulgate, Bible Book Titles and Names (#2)"],[1,"Neh  Tob  Idt  Est  Iob  Ps  Pr  Ecl  Ct  Sap  Sir  Is  Ir  Lam  Bar  Ez  Dn  Os  Ioel  Am  Abd  Ion  Mch  Nah  Hab  Soph  Agg  Zach  Mal  1Mcc  2Mcc    Mt  Mc  Lc  Io  Act  Rom  1Cor  2Cor  Gal  Eph  Phlp  Col  1Thes  2Thes  1Tim  2Tim  Tit  Phlm  Hbr  Iac  1Ptr  2Ptr  1Io  2Io  3Io  Iud  Apc    Man"]]]
