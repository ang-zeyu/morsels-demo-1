[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"  Africa has changed but little, Europe has, and we can hardly envy  the German nation its eminence and unexpected triumphs in war  when we see the energy and persistency with which they are  applying themselves to the arts of peace--especially of  exploration. And nowhere have they been more active than in this  part of the world, where their old rivals, the English, are  apparently contented to sit at home in ease, working their  factories and counting out their money.    To begin with the beginning. The year 1872 found the Berlin  Geographical Society intent upon \"planting a lance in Africa,\"  and upon extending and connecting the discoveries of Livingstone,  Du Chaillu, Schweinfurth, and other travellers. Delegates from  the various associations of Germany met in congress, and  organized (April 19, 1873) the Germanic \"Afrikanische  Gesellschaft.\" Ex-President Dr. Adolf Bastian, a well-known  traveller in Siam, Cambodia, China, and the Indian Archipelago,  and who, moreover, had visited Ambassi or Salvador do Congo, the  old missionary capital, in 1857, was at once sent out as pioneer  and vanguard to prospect the coast for a suitable station and a  point de départ into the interior--a scientific step dictated by  trained and organized common sense. The choice of leader fell  upon Dr. Gussfeldt, Herr von Hattorf being his second in command,  and with them were associated Dr. Falkenstein as zoologist, and  Dr. Soyaux as botanist. A geologist, Dr. Lenz, of Hamburg, was  sent to connect the Ogobe and Okanda rivers with, the Loango  coast, unless he found a likely northeastern route. In this case,  the Society would take measures to supply him with the necessary  equipment.    The expedition began unfortunately, by the loss of outfit and  instruments in the \"Nigritia,\" wrecked off Sierra Leone: it  persevered, however, and presently met Dr. Bastian and Professor  von Gorschen at Cabinda. The former had collected much  information about the coast. He had learned from slaves that the  old kingdoms of Loango, Mahango, and Angay are bounded eastwards,  or inland, by Mayombe, a belt of forest, the threshold of the  unknown interior. It begins the up-slope to the great Ghat ridge,  which, visible after a day's journey, separates the coast from  the central basin. A fortnight or three weeks' march leads to an  open country, a land of metalliferous hills, where the people  barter their goods against gunpowder and weapons, brought by  traders from the east. These \"Orientals\" are now heard of almost  all along the West African coast, and doubtless, in several  places, the report will prove true. The prospector had also  visited, in search of a depôt, Futila in Cabinda-land; the  Tschiluango (Chiloango), or Cacongo River, a fine navigable  stream, where the people float down their palm oil; Landana;  \"Chinsonso\" (Chinxoxo, pronounced Chinshosho), Chicambo, Loango,  and the Quillu (Kwillu) stream, the latter breaking through the  coast range, disemboguing near Loango Bay, and reported to be  connected with the great Congo. He found the old despotism of  Loango to be insignificant, reduced, in fact, to the strip of  coast between the Quillu and the Luema-Lukallo Rivers. The slave  trade, once a monopoly of kings, princes, and chiefs, is now no  more; legitimate commerce has levelled ranks, and the real power  is in the hands of the wealthiest merchants.    From the Abbé Durand, librarian of the Paris Geographical  Society, we learn: 1. That Loango is in the Province of Cacongo;  2. That Cacongo is considered a province of Loango; 3. That  Cacongo forms a kingdom of itself, with a capital, Ringwele. The  name of the late king was \"Dom João, Capitão Mempolo,\" and,  though he had died some years ago, he was not buried, for the  usual reasons, in early 1874. Meanwhile his nephew and successor,  Mwátá Bona, was acting regent until the obsequies shall take  place.    The station finally chosen by the German explorers was Chinxoxo,  or, as Herr Kiepert uncompromisingly writes it,  \"Tschinschonkscho.\" It is within easy distance of the Chiloango  or \"Luiza Loango\" River; and its port, Landana in Cabindaland,  has become a thoroughly Europeanized settlement, with five  trading stations up stream. An empty Dutch factory was repaired,  and the house, containing a parlour, three small bed rooms, and  the usual offices, was ready for habitation by the second week in  October.    On October 26th, Dr. Güssfeldt, after shaking off the \"seasoning  fever\" at Ponta Negra, proceeded to make a trial trip, and a  route survey with compass and chronometer, up the important  Quillu River. As usual, it has a bar; within the last few years  the right bank has been carried away by the floods, and some of  the old factories are under water. The average breadth is 400  paces, which diminishes to 25 at the rocky \"gates\" near Kama-  Chitoma, Manyamatal and Gotu. At 29 direct miles from the mouth  lies \"Chimbak,\" a trading station, where Dr. Güssfeldt rested and  recruited strength for a month. Thence he went leisurely up  stream to the Bumina Rapids, and found the easterly rhumb of the  river bending to the N.E. and the N.N.E.; its channel did not  exceed 50 yards in width, and precipitous rock-walls rose on  either hand. At Bumina as at Gotu the Quillu breaks through the  parallel lines of Ghats, whose trend is from N.W. to S.E.; in  fact, these \"Katarakten\" are the Yellalas of the Congo. A march  of four hours brought him to the Mayombe country (circ. S. Lat.  4°), which must not be confounded with the Ma-yumba or  northernmost possession of the Congo kingdom; the latter word  properly means \"King of Yumba,\" as Ma-Loango is Mwani-Loango. The  Mayombe chief proved friendly, and assisted Dr. Güssfeldt to hire  bearers (November 7) for Yangela, where his excursion ended. The  boundary-line is marked by a large gate, like the two openings in  the wooden wall denoting the Loango frontier between the Quillu  and Luema rivers. The character of the country changed to the  normal park-like aspect of Africa above the Ghats; the dense  forests waxed thin; picturesque views presented themselves,  reminding the wayfarer of Switzerland; and bare, dome-shaped  mountains formed the background. At Nsunsi, about 2,100 feet  above sea-level, the eye ranged over the Yangela country, as far  as the land of the Batetye, whose grassy plains are traversed by  ranges trending to the W.S.W., and apparently culminating to the  south. At the Tondo village the skull of a gorilla was remarked.  The upper Quillu, after its great bend, proved to be 350 to 400  paces broad; and the traveller ascertained that, instead of being  connected with the great artery, it rises in a lake nearly due  north of Nsundi (Sundi), near the country of the Babongo and the  Babum. Dr. Güssfeldt returned to the coast on December 2, and  prepared for the great march into the interior.    Dr. Falkenstein, the medicus and zoologist, in November 1873  reported favourably of Chinxoxo. The station is situated on a  hilly ridge commanding a view of the sea. \"It looks imposing  enough, but it would produce more effect if we could hoist the  German flag, as the other establishments here do those of their  respective nations. German ships would then take home news of the  progress of our undertaking, and the natives would see at a  distance this token of the enterprising spirit of the German  nation, and come to us with provisions and other natural  products.\" He adds, \"In Fernando Po, an island which I would  recommend as a sanatorium for wealthy hypochondriacs, we found an  extraordinary abundance of fruit, cocoa-nuts, bananas, mangoes,  delicious oranges, and pine-apples...The ivory trade on the  Gaboon is very flourishing. A German firm which I visited  exports, £10,000 worth per annum, the value of total exports  being, £26,000. The tusks are very large; one weighed about 80  lbs., and some have ranged to 120 lbs. The other articles  exported are gum and ebony, which are brought by the natives,  especially the Fans and Mpangwes (sic) from the interior. The  slave trade is said still to be carried on by Europeans, though  it is not known where the slaves go to \" (of course to São Thomé  and Prince's Island). \"In the immediate vicinity of our station  the chief trade is in palm oil and ground nuts..... Rings,  chains, crosses, watches, &c., are readily taken by the savages  in exchange for native goods, and I obtained a valuable fetish  for a chain and a cross worth a silbergroschen.\"    After three months spent upon the coast, and much suffering from  fever, the energetic Dr. Bastian was welcomed home on December  13, 1873. His present book[FN#1] makes only one instalment of the  work, the other being the \"Correspondenzblätter der Afrikanischen  Gesellschaft.\" Briefly, everything has been done to lay the  foundation for success and to advertise the undertaking. Finally,  not satisfied with these steps, the German Society for the  Exploration of equatorial Africa organized in September, 1874, a  second expedition. Captain Alexander von Homeyer, a well-known  ornithologist, will lead it viâ S. Paulo de Loanda and Cassange  (Kasanji) to the mysterious lands of the Mwata ya Nvo, and thus  supplement the labours of Portuguese travellers. This fine  undertaking set out early in 1875.                                      Chapter II.                        To São Paulo De Loanda.        At Loango, by invitation of Commander Hoskins, R.N., I  transferred myself on board H.M. Steamship \"Zebra,\" one of the  nymphs of the British navy, and began the 240 miles southwards.  There was no wind except a slant at sunset, and the current often  carried us as far backwards as the sails drove us onwards. The  philosophic landlubber often wonders at the eternal restlessness  of his naval brother-man, who ever sighs for a strong wind to  make the port, and who in port is ever anxious to get out of it.  I amused myself in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#2)"],[1,"a village, _maaedangi_ a  day, _maaerodo_ darkness.    5. _Qe_ is used with certain nouns: _qe afe_ a widow, _qe ia_ a  fish, _qe oru_ a widow; _na_ may be prefixed: _na qe ia gi_ the  fishes.    6. _Fe_ is used of things spherical in shape and denotes a unit: _fe  bread_ a loaf, _fe bubulu_ a star; also _fe gale bola_ a young  pigeon, _fe rade_ a reed; _fe_ is used of one of a series: _fe rodo_  a night, _fe asua_ a day; _fe_ is also used as a multiplicative: _fe  fiu ade doo taala_ seven cases of wrong-doing; _na or ta or te_ may  precede.    7. _Gi_ denotes plurality and follows the noun: _na mwane gi_ the  males.  It may be separated from the noun: _na doo nia gi_ his  things; _gi_ is used with the forms of the personal pronoun plural  except those ending in _lu_.    8. _Mwai_ is used with nouns of relationship only: _mwai asi nia_  his brethren, _ro mwai sasina_ brethren.    9. In Port Adam _ote_ seems to be employed as a regular plural  article: _ote mwane gi_ you men. But it is a question whether _ote_  is not properly employed of females only: _ote aia nia_ his female  relations, _ote sasina_ his sisters, _ote ai_ you women, _ote ai gi_  you women.    10. _A_ is used as a personal article with the names of males, both  native and foreign: _a Leo_, _a Joe_. It is used also with _doo_  thing: _a doo_ so and so, _a doo na_ the person.    _Ni_ is used as a personal article with the names of females, both  native and foreign: _ni Alida_, _ni Mary_. It is used also with  certain nouns which denote women, where in Sa'a _nga_ or the  personal article _a_ is used: _ni te nau_ my mother, _ni mwaemwane_  a man's sister, a woman's brother, _ni aia_ female relations, _ni  doo_ the woman, _ni mwela ne_ that woman. _Ni_ is not used with  _afe_ wife, nor with _geni_ female; it is not used with the plural.      NOUNS.    1. Nouns to which possessive suffixes may be added:    Certain nouns take the suffixed pronoun denoting the possessor.  These are nouns denoting:    a. Parts of the body: _lima_ hand, _limagu_ my hand, _aba_ arm,  _abamu_ thy arm, _maa_ eye, _maamu_ thy eye.    b. Position, end, middle, top: _buri_ behind, _burigu_ behind me, _i  dalumana_ in the midst, _isingana_ its end, _i kamena lobo_ beside  the lake, _i fafona_ on top of it.    c. Certain states or doings of men: life, death, speech, custom,  goings: _mae_ to die, _maela_ death, _maelana_ his death, _baela_  speech, _baelagu_ my word.    d. The word _sasi_ brother, _sasigu_ my brother, my sister. The  other words denoting relationship employ the personal pronoun to  denote possession.    2. Formation of nouns: Nouns which have a special termination  showing them to be nouns substantive are (a) verbal nouns and (b)  independent nouns.    a. Verbal nouns are formed from verbs by the terminations _a_, _fa_,  _la_, _ta_: _mae_ to die, _maea_ death or sickness, _maela_ death,  _bae_ to speak, _baea_ word, _baela_ speech, _fanga_ to eat,  _fangaa_ feast, food, _fangala_ food, _mae_ to die, _maemaefa_  sickness, _nao_ to lead, _naofa_ first, _naofe mwela_ eldest child,  also with suffixed pronoun _naofana mwela_; _ta_ is seen in the root  _afuta_ all, which is used only with the suffixed pronoun,  _afutagera_ all of them, _afutana na ai gi_ all the people. The  termination _la_ has a more or less gerundival force.    Compound nouns may be formed, _girigiri lifoa_ gnashing of teeth,  _saitama dooa_ wisdom.    Where in the vocabulary _fa_ and _ta_ have a hyphen attached, it is  intended to show that they are used only with the suffixed pronoun  attached.    There are certain adjectives to which the termination _la_ is  attached, _diena_ good, _dienala_ goodness, _baita_ big, _baitala_  bigness, and _tasa_ in excess, _tasala_ excess. It is probable,  however, that these words are really verbs.    b. Independent nouns: The only termination is na, and this is added  (1) to certain nouns which express relation ship or kindred; (2) to  cardinal numerals to form ordinals. 1. Nouns so formed are always  preceded by a prefix which marks reciprocity of relationship or  kindred, _mwai_, and by the numeral _ro_ two; _sasi_ brother, _ro  mwai sasina_ the two brothers, _te_ mother, _ro mwai telana_ wife  and child.    2. Numerals: _olu_ three, _oluna_ third.    3. Construct form: To make a construct form the letter _e_ is added  to the first of two nouns, _toloe fera_ hill, _fuli abae ai_ men's  handwork. When the first member ends in _a_ the _ae_ sometimes  contracts to _e_, _fufue ai_ seed, _aqale mwai_ ten baskets, but  _maae rodo_, a night; also when the first noun ends in _o_ the _oe_  is contracted to _e_: _abole ai_ a log, _abolo_ a piece. This _e_  may be added to words which have not a distinct noun termination:  _naoe gula_ the chief place.    4. Genitive relation: The genitive relation of nouns one to another  is effected by the use of the propositions _ni_ and _i_: _ni_ is  used mainly in construction: _baea ni sugela_ deceitful words, _gwai  ni gwaila_ anointing oil; _ni_ expresses purpose: _si gula ni lea  inia_ a place for him to go to, _rosuli ni manatai gami_ hear us in  mercy. In certain words _li_ replaces _ni_: _maalimaea_ enemy,  _maalitafa_ a channel in a reef; _i_ is used also to denote purpose:  _lea i fasifa_ came to sell it. Location, which also denotes place  whence, is shown by _i_, _geni i Saa_, a Sa'a woman. _Si_ is used in  certain phrases: _ofu si doo_ bundles, _ro tooni si doo_ two  thousand.    The genitive is frequently omitted _olu teu flour_, three measures  of flour, _mumudi fangala_ crumbs of food, _mwane Saa_, a Sa'a man,  _falisi vine_ a vineyard.    The possessive _ana_ may be used to denote the genitive: _luma ana  foaa_ house of prayer, _tala ana fanualama_ way of peace. A genitive  relation is also shown by the use of the suffixed pronoun of the  third person singular or plural in agreement with the idea expressed  in the second noun of the pair: _i tolona fera_ on the tops of the  hills, _gwouda na ai gi_ men's heads.    The ordinary personal pronouns are used as possessive in cases where  the pronoun can not be suffixed: _afe nau_ my wife, _arai nia_ her  husband.    The instrumental prefix i occurs: _kamu_ to eat areca nut, _ikamu_ a  line spatula.    5. Plural: To show plurality _gi_ is used, following the noun _na  mwane gi_ the men. The word _oro_, many, may be attached: _na mwane  oro gi_ many men, _tani ai oro_ many people.    The personal pronoun plural third _gera_ is used to mark plurality:  _gera fiolo_ the hungry, _gera priest da adea urina_ the priests  acted thus.    Totally and completion are shown by _sui_ finished or _sui na_:  _afutada sui_ they all, _gera lea sui na_ they have gone already. To  express totality the suffixed pronoun singular third and all persons  plural are added to a root _afuta_, formed from _afu_ to complete,  with _ta_ noun termination: _afutanafera_ all the land, _afutana  nonigu_ all my whole body. It is a question whether the numeral  _qalu_ eight is used like _walu_ in Sa'a of an indefinite number,  e.g., _qalu fera_ all lands; but _te si nafera_ seems to be the  proper usage.    6. Gender: There is no grammatical gender. The words _mwane_ male,  _geni_ female, are added when the noun does not carry a sex  distinction.    7. Nouns of relationship: With the exception of sasi brother,  sister, nouns of relationship are never used with a suffixed  pronoun: _maa nau_ my father. The prefix _mwai_, denoting  reciprocity of relationship, may precede: _mwai asi nau_ brethren.  In speaking of pairs of people _ro_ is used: _ro mwai sasina_ two  brothers. The _na_ of _sasina_, _telana_, etc., is a noun  termination and is not the suffixed pronoun.    The articles _ni_ for the singular and _ote_ for the plural are used  of women: _ni aia_ a female relation, _ote geni_ women.    The word for father is _maa_; the article _na_ may be prefixed: _na  maa nau_ my father. The Rev. A. I.  Hopkins says that _maaka nau_ is  also commonly used as meaning my father. The word for child is  _mwela_, _mwela na ai_ So-and-So's son, _mwela nia_ his child; _aia_  is used for female relations with _ni_ as singular article and _ote_  as plural: _mwaemwane_ sister, _ni mwaemwane_ a man's sister.    The adjective _gale_ little, is used preceding the noun to describe  something young: _ro fe gale bola_ two young pigeons. The article  used with _te_, mother, is _ni_: _ni te nau_ my mother; _ta ro mwai  telana nau_ my wife and child, _ta ro mwai fungona_ two  relations-at-law; _ai_ person, man, is used as a vocative: _mwela  ai_ hey, you there! _na ai oe_ your people, _ai ni raoa_ a servant,  _ai tou_ the little one, the lesser.      PRONOUNS.    The pronouns may be classified as (A) those used as the subject of a  verb; (B) those suffixed to a verb or a preposition as object; (c)  those suffixed to nouns substantive and denoting possession.    A.   PRONOUNS USED AS THE SUBJECT OF A VERB.    Singular:    (1) _inau, naut gu_.    (2) _ioe, oe, o_.    (3) _inia, niat nit e_.    Plural:    Inclusive:    (1) _igia, gia; igolu, golu_.    Exclusive:    (1) _igami, gami, mi; igamelu, gamelu_.                  (2) _igamu, gamu; igamolu, gamolu_.                  (3) _igera, gera, da; idalu, dalu_.    Dual:    Inclusive:    (1) _igoro, goro_.    Exclusive:    (1) _igamere, gamere_.                  (2) _igamoro, gamoro_.                  (3) _idarot daro_.    1. The longer forms, those with _i_, are used as possessive pronouns  when the suffixed pronoun can not be added: _geni inau_ my wife.    The forms with _i_ are never used by themselves as the subject, but  are accompanied by one of the shorter forms: _igera da ada ma da si  ada na_ they see but do not see. The three longer forms in the  singular are of more or less infrequent use. The initial _i_ is run  on to the preceding vowel in pronunciation.    2. All the forms without _i_ are used alone as the subject of the  verb. Where there are three forms the second"]]]
