To be sure,  she received a pension of eight dollars a month, in consideration of  her husband's services in the war, but eight dollars would not go far  towards supporting their family, small as it was. There were other means  of earning a living, to be sure, but Wayneboro was an agricultural town  mainly, and unless he hired out on a farm there seemed no way open to  him, while the little sewing his mother might be able to procure would  probably pay her less than a dollar a week.    The blow fell sooner than he expected. In the course of the next week  Mrs. Carr was notified that Ebenezer Graham had been appointed her  successor, and she was directed to turn over the papers and property of  the office to him.    She received the official notification by the afternoon mail, and in the  evening she was favored by a call from her successor.    Ebenezer Graham was a small man, with insignificant, mean-looking  features, including a pair of weazel-like eyes and a turn-up nose. It  did not require a skillful physiognomist to read his character in his  face. Meanness was stamped upon it in unmistakable characters.    \"Good-evening, Mr. Graham,\" said the widow, gravely.    \"Good-evening, ma'am,\" said the storekeeper. \"I've called to see you,  Mrs. Carr, about the post office, I presume you have heard--\"    \"I have heard that you are to be my successor.\"    \"Just so. As long as your husband was alive, I didn't want to step into  his shoes.\"    \"But you are willing to step into mine,\" said Mrs. Carr, smiling  faintly.    \"Just so--that is, the gov'ment appear to think a man ought to be in  charge of so responsible a position.\"    \"I shall be glad if you manage the office better than I have done.\"    \"You see, ma'am, it stands to reason that a man is better fitted for  business than a woman,\" said Ebenezer Graham, in a smooth tone for he  wanted to get over this rather awkward business as easily as possible.  \"Women, you know, was made to adorn the domestic circles, et cetery.\"    \"Adorning the domestic circle won't give me a living,\" said Mrs. Carr,  with some bitterness, for she knew that but for the grasping spirit of  the man before her she would have been allowed to retain her office.    \"I was comin' to that,\" said the new postmaster. \"Of course, I  appreciate your position as a widder, without much means, and I'm going  to make you an offer; that is, your boy, Herbert.\"    Herbert looked up from a book he was reading, and listened with interest  to hear the benevolent intentions of the new postmaster.    \"I am ready to give him a place in my store,\" proceeded Ebenezer. \"I  always keep a boy, and thinks I to myself, the wages I give will  help along the widder Carr. You see, I like to combine business with  consideration for my feller creeters.\"    Mrs. Carr smiled faintly, for in spite of her serious strait she could  not help being amused at the notion of Ebenezer Graham's philanthropy.    \"What's going to become of Tom Tripp?\" asked Herbert, abruptly.    \"Thomas Tripp isn't exactly the kind of boy I want in my store,\" said  Mr. Graham. \"He's a harum-scarum sort of boy, and likes to shirk his  work. Then I suspect he stops to play on the way when I send him on  errands. Yesterday he was five minutes longer than he need to have been  in goin' to Sam Dunning's to carry some groceries. Thomas doesn't seem  to appreciate his privileges in bein' connected with a business like  mine.\"    Tom Tripp was hardly to blame for not recognizing his good luck in  occupying a position where he received a dollar and a half a week for  fourteen hours daily work, with half a dozen scoldings thrown in.    \"How do you know I will suit you any better than Tom?\" asked Herbert,  who did not think it necessary to thank Mr. Graham for the proffered  engagement until he learned just what was expected of him, and what his  pay was to be.    \"You're a different sort of a boy,\" said Ebenezer, with an attempt at a  pleasant smile. \"You've been brought up different. I've heard you're a  smart, capable boy, that isn't afraid of work.\"    \"No, sir, I am not, if I am fairly paid for my work.\"    The new postmaster's jaw fell, and he looked uneasy, for he always  grudged the money he paid out, even the paltry dollar and a half which  went to poor Tom.    \"I always calkerlate to pay fair wages,\" he said; \"but I ain't rich, and  I can't afford to fling away money.\"    \"How much do you pay Tom Tripp?\" asked Herbert.    He knew, but he wanted to draw Mr. Graham out.    \"I pay Thomas a dollar and fifty cents a week,\" answered the  storekeeper, in a tone which indicated that he regarded this, on the  whole, as rather a munificent sum.    \"And he works from seven in the morning till nine o'clock at night,\"  proceeded Herbert.    \"Them are the hours,\" said Ebenezer, who knew better how to make money  than to speak grammatically.    \"It makes a pretty long day,\" observed Mrs. Carr.    \"So it does, ma'am, but it's no longer than I work myself.\"    \"You get paid rather better, I presume.\"    \"Of course, ma'am, as I am the proprietor.\"    \"I couldn't think of working for any such sum,\" said Herbert, decidedly.    Mr. Graham looked disturbed, for he had reasons for desiring to secure  Herbert, who was familiar with the routine of post-office work.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I might be able to offer you a leetle more, as you  know how to tend the post office. That's worth somethin'! I'll  give you--lemme see--twenty-five cents more; that is, a dollar and  seventy-five cents a week.\"    Herbert and his mother exchanged glances. They hardly knew whether to  feel more amused or disgusted at their visitor's meanness.    \"Mr. Graham,\" said Herbert, \"if you wish to secure my services, you will  have to pay me three dollars a week.\"    The storekeeper held up both hands in dismay.    \"Three dollars a week for a boy!\" he exclaimed.    \"Yes, sir; I will come for a short time for that sum, till you get used  to the management of the post office, but I shall feel justified in  leaving you when I can do better.\"    \"You must think I am made of money,\" said Ebenezer hastily.    \"I think you can afford to pay me that salary.\"    For twenty minutes the new postmaster tried to beat down his prospective  clerk, but Herbert was obstinate, and Ebenezer rather ruefully promised  to give him his price, chiefly because it was absolutely necessary that  he should engage some one who was more familiar with the post-office  work than he was. Herbert agreed to go to work the next morning.          CHAPTER III. A PRODIGAL SON.        Herbert did not look forward with very joyful anticipations to the new  engagement he had formed. He knew very well that he should not like  Ebenezer Graham as an employer, but it was necessary that he should earn  something, for the income was now but two dollars a week. He was sorry,  too, to displace Tom Tripp, but upon this point his uneasiness was soon  removed, for Tom dropped in just after Mr. Graham had left the house,  and informed Herbert that he was to go to work the next day for a farmer  in the neighborhood, at a dollar and a half per week, and board besides.    \"I am glad to hear it, Tom,\" said Herbert, heartily. \"I didn't want to  feel that I was depriving you of employment.\"    \"You are welcome to my place in the store,\" said Tom. \"I'm glad to give  it up. Mr. Graham seemed to think I was made of iron, and I could work  like a machine, without getting tired. I hope he pays you more than a  dollar and a half a week.\"    \"He has agreed to pay me three dollars,\" said Herbert.    Tom whistled in genuine amazement.    \"What! has the old man lost his senses?\" he exclaimed. \"He must be crazy  to offer such wages as that.\"    \"He didn't offer them. I told him I wouldn't come for less.\"    \"I don't see how he came to pay such a price.\"    \"Because he wanted me to take care of the post office. I know all about  it, and he doesn't.\"    \"As soon as he learns, he will reduce your wages.\"    \"Then I shall leave him.\"    \"Well, I hope you'll like store work better than I do.\"    The next two or three days were spent in removing the post office to  one corner of Eben-ezer Graham's store. The removal was superintended by  Herbert, who was not interfered with to any extent by his employer, nor  required to do much work in the store. Our hero was agreeably surprised,  and began to think he should get along better than he anticipated.    At the end of the first week the storekeeper, while they were closing  the shutters, said: \"I expect, Herbert, you'd just as lieves take your  pay in groceries and goods from the store?\"    \"No, sir,\" answered Herbert, \"I prefer to be paid in money, and to pay  for such goods as we buy.\"    \"I don't see what odds it makes to you,\" said Ebenezer. \"It comes to the  same thing, doesn't it?\"    \"Then if it comes to the same thing,\" retorted Herbert, \"why do you want  to pay me in goods?\"    \"Ahem! It saves trouble. I'll just charge everything you buy, and give  you the balance Saturday night.\"    \"I should prefer the money, Mr. Graham,\" said Herbert, firmly.    So the storekeeper, considerably against his will, drew three dollars in  bills from the drawer and handed them to his young clerk.    \"It's a good deal of money, Herbert,\" he said, \"for a boy. There ain't  many men would pay you such a good salary.\"    \"I earn every cent of it, Mr. Graham,\" said Herbert, whose views on the  salary question differed essentially from those of his employer.    The next morning Mr. Graham received a letter which evidently disturbed  him. Before referring to its contents, it is necessary to explain that  he had one son, nineteen years of age, who had gone to Boston two years  previous, to take a place in a dry-goods store on Washington Street.

Landing at the Rio Gabão (Gaboon River).--le Plateau, the French                              Colony.        I remember with lively pleasure my first glance at the classic  stream of the \"Portingal Captains\" and the \"Zeeland interlopers.\"  The ten-mile breadth of the noble Gaboon estuary somewhat dwarfed  the features of either shore as we rattled past Cape Santa Clara,  a venerable name, \"'verted\" to Joinville. The bold northern head,  though not \"very high land,\" makes some display, because we see  it in a better light; and its environs are set off by a line of  scattered villages. The vis-a-vis of Louis Philippe Peninsula on  the starboard bow (Zuidhoeck), \"Sandy Point\" or Sandhoeck, by the  natives called Pongára, and by the French Péninsule de Marie-  Amélie, shows a mere fringe of dark bristle, which is tree, based  upon a broad red-yellow streak, which is land. As we pass through  the slightly overhung mouth, we can hardly complain with a late  traveller of the Gaboon's \"sluggish waters;\" during the ebb they  run like a mild mill-race, and when the current, setting to the  north-west, meets a strong sea-breeze from the west, there is a  criss-cross, a tide-rip, contemptible enough to a cruizer, but  quite capable of filling cock-boats. And, nearing the end of our  voyage, we rejoice to see that the dull down-pourings and the  sharp storms of Fernando Po have apparently not yet migrated so  far south. Dancing blue wavelets, under the soft azure sky, plash  and cream upon the pure clean sand that projects here and there  black lines of porous ironstone waiting to become piers; and the  water-line is backed by swelling ridges, here open and green-  grassed, there spotted with islets of close and shady trees.  Mangrove, that horror of the African voyager, shines by its  absence; and the soil is not mud, but humus based on gravels or  on ruddy clays, stiff and retentive. The formation, in fact, is  everywhere that of Eyo or Yoruba, the goodly region lying west of  the lower Niger, and its fertility must result from the abundant  water supply of the equatorial belt.    The charts are fearful to look upon. The embouchure, well known  to old traders, has been scientifically surveyed in our day by  Lieutenant Alph. Fleuriot de Langle, of La Malouine (1845), and  the chart was corrected from a survey ordered by Capitaine Bouët-  Willaumez (1849); in the latter year it was again revised by M.  Charles Floix, of the French navy, and, with additions by the  officers of Her Britannic Majesty's service, it becomes our No.  1877. The surface is a labyrinth of banks, rocks, and shoals,  \"Ely,\" \"Nisus,\" \"Alligator,\" and \"Caraibe.\" In such surroundings  as these, when the water shallows apace, the pilot must not be  despised.    Her Majesty's steam-ship \"Griffon,\" Commander Perry, found  herself, at 2 P.M. on Monday, March, 17, 1862, in a snug berth  opposite Le Plateau, as the capital of the French colony is  called, and amongst the shipping of its chief port, Aumale Road.  The river at this neck is about five miles broad, and the scene  was characteristically French. Hardly a merchant vessel lay  there. We had no less than four naval consorts \"La Caravane,\"  guard-ship, store-ship, and hospital-hulk; a fine transport, \"La  Riège,\" bound for Goree; \"La Recherche,\" a wretched old sailing  corvette which plies to Assini and Grand Basam on the Gold Coast;  and, lastly, \"La Junon,\" chef de division Baron Didelot, then one  of the finest frigates in the French navy, armed with fifty  rifled sixty-eight pounders. It is curious that, whilst our  neighbours build such splendid craft, and look so neat and natty  in naval uniform, they pay so little regard to the order and  cleanliness of their floating homes.    After visiting every English colony on the West Coast of Africa,  I resolved curiously to examine my first specimen of our rivals,  the \"principal centre of trade in western equatorial Africa.\" The  earliest visit--in uniform, of course--was to Baron Didelot,  whose official title is \"Commandant Supérieur des Établissements  de la Côte d'Or et du Gabon;\" the following was to M. H. S.  L'Aulnois, \"Lieutenant de Vaisseau et Commandant Particulier du  Comptoir de Gabon.\" These gentlemen have neat bungalows and  gardens; they may spend their days ashore, but they are very  careful to sleep on board. All the official whites appear to have  a morbid horror of the climate; when attacked by fever, they  \"cave in\" at once, and recovery can hardly be expected. This year  also, owing to scanty rains, sickness has been rife, and many  cases which began with normal mildness have ended suddenly and  fatally. Besides fear of fever, they are victims to ennui and  nostalgia; and, expecting the Comptoir to pay large profits, they  are greatly disappointed by the reverse being the case.    But how can they look for it to be otherwise? The modern French  appear fit to manage only garrisons and military posts. They will  make everything official, and they will not remember the protest  against governing too much, offered by the burgesses of Paris to  Louis le Grand. They are always on duty; they are never out of  uniform, mentally and metaphorically, as well as bodily and  literally. Nothing is done without delay, even in the matter of  signing a ship's papers. A long procès-verbal takes the place of  our summary punishment, and the gros canon is dragged into use on  every occasion, even to enforce the payment of native debts.    In the Gaboon, also, there is a complication of national  jealousy, suggesting the mastiff and the poodle. A perpetual war  rages about flags. English craft may carry their colours as far  up stream as Coniquet Island; beyond this point they must either  hoist a French ensign, or sail without bunting--should the  commodore permit. Otherwise they will be detained by the  commander of the hulk \"l'Oise,\" stationed at Anenge-nenge, some  thirty-eight to forty miles above Le Plateau. Lately a Captain  Gordon, employed by Mr. Francis Wookey of Taunton, was ordered to  pull down his flag: those who know the \"mariner of England\" will  appreciate his feelings on the occasion. Small vessels belonging  to foreigners, and employed in cabotage, must not sail with their  own papers, and even a change of name is effected under  difficulties. About a week before my arrival a certain pan-  Teutonic Hamburgher, Herr B--, amused himself, after a copious  breakfast, with hoisting and saluting the Union Jack, in honour  of a distinguished guest, Major L--.  report was at once spread  that the tricolor had been hauled down \"with extreme indignity;\"  and the Commodore took the trouble to reprimand the white, and to  imprison \"Tom Case,\" the black in whose town the outrage had been  allowed.    This by way of parenthesis. My next step was to request the  pleasure of a visit from Messrs. Hogg and Kirkwood, who were in  charge of the English factories at Glass Town and Olomi; they  came down stream at once, and kindly acted as ciceroni around Le  Plateau. The landing is good; a reef has been converted into a  jetty and little breakwater; behind this segment of a circle we  disembarked without any danger of being washed out of the boat,  as at S'a Leone, Cape Coast Castle, and Accra. Unfortunately just  above this pier there is a Dutch-like jardin d'été--beds of dirty  weeds bordering a foul and stagnant swamp, while below the  settlement appears a huge coal-shed: the expensive mineral is  always dangerous when exposed in the tropics, and some thirty per  cent. would be saved by sending out a hulk. The next point is the  Hotel and Restaurant Fischer--pronounced Fi-cherre, belonging to  an energetic German-Swiss widow, who during six years' exile had  amassed some 65,000 francs. In an evil hour she sent a thieving  servant before the \"commissaire de police;\" the negress escaped  punishment, but the verandah with its appurtenances caught fire,  and everything, even the unpacked billiard-table, was burnt to  ashes. Still, Madame the Brave never lost heart. She applied  herself valiantly as a white ant to repairing her broken home,  and, wonderful to relate in this land of no labour, ruled by the  maxim \"festina lente,\" all had been restored within six months.  We shall dine at her table d'hôte.    Our guide led up and along the river bank, where there is almost  a kilometre of road facing six or seven kilometres of nature's  highway--the stream. The swampy jungle is not cleared off from  about the Comptoir, and presently the perfume of the fat, rank  weeds; and the wretched bridges, a few planks spanning black and  fetid mud, drove us northwards or inland, towards the neat house  and grounds of the \"Commandant Particulier.\" The outside walls,  built in grades with the porous, dark-red, laterite-like stone  dredged from the river, are whitewashed with burnt coralline and  look clean; whilst the house, one of the best in the place, is  French, that is to say, pretty. Near it is a cluster of native  huts, mostly with walls of corded bamboo, some dabbed with clay  and lime, and all roofed with the ever shabby-looking palm-leaf;  none are as neat as those of the \"bushmen\" in the interior, where  they are regularly and carefully made like baskets or panniers.  The people appeared friendly; the men touched their hats, and the  women dropped unmistakably significant curtsies.    After admiring the"]]]
