[23] That of Germany,  on the other hand, they assert to be a modern addition; [24] for that  the people who first crossed the Rhine, and expelled the Gauls, and  are now called Tungri, were then named Germans; which appellation of a  particular tribe, not of a whole people, gradually prevailed; so that  the title of Germans, first assumed by the victors in order to excite  terror, was afterwards adopted by the nation in general. [25] They  have likewise the tradition of a Hercules [26] of their country, whose  praises they sing before those of all other heroes as they advance to  battle.    3. A peculiar kind of verses is also current among them, by the recital  of which, termed \"barding,\" [27] they stimulate their courage; while the  sound itself serves as an augury of the event of the impending combat.  For, according to the nature of the cry proceeding from the line, terror  is inspired or felt: nor does it seem so much an articulate song, as the  wild chorus of valor. A harsh, piercing note, and a broken roar, are  the favorite tones; which they render more full and sonorous by applying  their mouths to their shields. [28] Some conjecture that Ulysses, in the  course of his long and fabulous wanderings, was driven into this ocean,  and landed in Germany; and that Asciburgium, [29] a place situated on  the Rhine, and at this day inhabited, was founded by him, and named  _Askipurgion_. They pretend that an altar was formerly discovered here,  consecrated to Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes subjoined;  and that certain monuments and tombs, inscribed with Greek characters,  [30] are still extant upon the confines of Germany and Rhaetia. These  allegations I shall neither attempt to confirm nor to refute: let every  one believe concerning them as he is disposed.    4. I concur in opinion with those who deem the Germans never to have  intermarried with other nations; but to be a race, pure, unmixed, and  stamped with a distinct character. Hence a family likeness pervades the  whole, though their numbers are so great: eyes stern and blue; ruddy  hair; large bodies, [31] powerful in sudden exertions, but impatient of  toil and labor, least of all capable of sustaining thirst and heat. Cold  and hunger they are accustomed by their climate and soil to endure.    5. The land, though varied to a considerable extent in its aspect, is  yet universally shagged with forests, or deformed by marshes: moister on  the side of Gaul, more bleak on the side of Norieum and Pannonia. [32]  It is productive of grain, but unkindly to fruit-trees. [33] It abounds  in flocks and herds, but in general of a small breed. Even the beeve  kind are destitute of their usual stateliness and dignity of head: [34]  they are, however, numerous, and form the most esteemed, and, indeed,  the only species of wealth. Silver and gold the gods, I know not whether  in their favor or anger, have denied to this country. [35] Not that I  would assert that no veins of these metals are generated in Germany; for  who has made the search? The possession of them is not coveted by these  people as it is by us. Vessels of silver are indeed to be seen among  them, which have been presented to their ambassadors and chiefs; but  they are held in no higher estimation than earthenware. The borderers,  however, set a value on gold and silver for the purpose of commerce,  and have learned to distinguish several kinds of our coin, some of which  they prefer to others: the remoter inhabitants continue the more simple  and ancient usage of bartering commodities. The money preferred by the  Germans is the old and well-known species, such as the _Serrati_ and  _Bigati_. [36] They are also better pleased with silver than gold; [37]  not on account of any fondness for that metal, but because the smaller  money is more convenient in their common and petty merchandise.    6. Even iron is not plentiful [38] among them; as may be inferred from  the nature of their weapons. Swords or broad lances are seldom used; but  they generally carry a spear, (called in their language _framea_, [39])  which has an iron blade, short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable,  that, as occasion requires, they employ it either in close or distant  fighting. [40] This spear and a shield are all the armor of the cavalry.  The foot have, besides, missile weapons, several to each man, which they  hurl to an immense distance. [41] They are either naked, [42] or lightly  covered with a small mantle; and have no pride in equipage: their  shields only are ornamented with the choicest colors. [43] Few are  provided with a coat of mail; [44] and scarcely here and there one with  a casque or helmet. [45] Their horses are neither remarkable for beauty  nor swiftness, nor are they taught the various evolutions practised with  us. The cavalry either bear down straight forwards, or wheel once to  the right, in so compact a body that none is left behind the rest. Their  principal strength, on the whole, consists in their infantry: hence  in an engagement these are intermixed with the cavalry; [46] so Well  accordant with the nature of equestrian combats is the agility of those  foot soldiers, whom they select from the whole body of their youth,  and place in the front of the line. Their number, too, is determined; a  hundred from each canton: [47] and they are distinguished at home by a  name expressive of this circumstance; so that what at first was only an  appellation of number, becomes thenceforth a title of honor. Their line  of battle is disposed in wedges. [48] To give ground, provided  they rally again, is considered rather as a prudent strategem, than  cowardice. They carry off their slain even while the battle remains  undecided. The greatest disgrace that can befall them is to have  abandoned their shields. [49] A person branded with this ignominy is not  permitted to join in their religious rites, or enter their assemblies;  so that many, after escaping from battle, have put an end to their  infamy by the halter.    7. In the election of kings they have regard to birth; in that of  generals, [50] to valor. Their kings have not an absolute or unlimited  power; [51] and their generals command less through the force of  authority, than of example. If they are daring, adventurous, and  conspicuous in action, they procure obedience from the admiration they  inspire. None, however, but the priests [52] are permitted to judge  offenders, to inflict bonds or stripes; so that chastisement appears not  as an act of military discipline, but as the instigation of the god whom  they suppose present with warriors. They also carry with them to battle  certain images and standards taken from the sacred groves. [53] It is  a principal incentive to their courage, that their squadrons and  battalions are not formed by men fortuitously collected, but by the  assemblage of families and clans. Their pledges also are near at hand;  they have within hearing the yells of their women, and the cries of  their children. These, too, are the most revered witnesses of each man's  conduct, these his most liberal applauders. To their mothers and their  wives they bring their wounds for relief, nor do these dread to count  or to search out the gashes. The women also administer food and  encouragement to those who are fighting.    8. Tradition relates, that armies beginning to give way have been  rallied by the females, through the earnestness of their supplications,  the interposition of their bodies, [54] and the pictures they have drawn  of impending slavery, [55] a calamity which these people bear with more  impatience for their women than themselves; so that those states who  have been obliged to give among their hostages the daughters of noble  families, are the most effectually bound to fidelity. [56] They even  suppose somewhat of sanctity and prescience to be inherent in the female  sex; and therefore neither despise their counsels, [57] nor disregard  their responses. [58] We have beheld, in the reign of Vespasian, Veleda,  [59] long reverenced by many as a deity. Aurima, moreover, and several  others, [60] were formerly held in equal veneration, but not with a  servile flattery, nor as though they made them goddesses. [61]    9. Of the gods, Mercury [62] is the principal object of their adoration;  whom, on certain days, [63] they think it lawful to propitiate even with  human victims. To Hercules and Mars [64] they offer the animals usually  allotted for sacrifice. [65] Some of the Suevi also perform sacred rites  to Isis. What was the cause and origin of this foreign worship, I have  not been able to discover; further than that her being represented with  the symbol of a galley, seems to indicate an imported religion. [66]  They conceive it unworthy the grandeur of celestial beings to confine  their deities within walls, or to represent them under a human  similitude: [67] woods and groves are their temples; and they affix  names of divinity to that secret power, which they behold with the eye  of adoration alone.    10. No people are more addicted to divination by omens and lots. The  latter is performed in the following simple manner. They cut a twig [68]  from a fruit-tree, and divide it into small pieces, which, distinguished  by certain marks, are thrown promiscuously upon a white garment. Then,  the priest of the canton, if the occasion be public; if private, the  master of the family; after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes  lifted up to heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and, as they come up,  interprets their signification according to the marks fixed upon them.  If the result prove unfavorable, there is no more consultation on the  same affair that day; if propitious, a confirmation by omens is still  required.

It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles wide. Once every thousand  years a little bird comes to this rock to sharpen its beak.    When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day of eternity  will have gone by.          THE SETTING OF THE STAGE      WE live under the shadow of a gigantic question mark.    Who are we?    Where do we come from?    Whither are we bound?    Slowly, but with persistent courage, we have been pushing this question  mark further and further towards that distant line, beyond the horizon,  where we hope to find our answer.    We have not gone very far.    We still know very little but we have reached the point where (with a  fair degree of accuracy) we can guess at many things.    In this chapter I shall tell you how (according to our best belief) the  stage was set for the first appearance of man.    If we represent the time during which it has been possible for animal  life to exist upon our planet by a line of this length, then the tiny  line just below indicates the age during which man (or a creature more  or less resembling man) has lived upon this earth.    Man was the last to come but the first to use his brain for the purpose  of conquering the forces of nature. That is the reason why we are going  to study him, rather than cats or dogs or horses or any of the other  animals, who, all in their own way, have a very interesting historical  development behind them.    In the beginning, the planet upon which we live was (as far as we now  know) a large ball of flaming matter, a tiny cloud of smoke in the  endless ocean of space. Gradually, in the course of millions of years,  the surface burned itself out, and was covered with a thin layer of  rocks. Upon these lifeless rocks the rain descended in endless torrents,  wearing out the hard granite and carrying the dust to the valleys that  lay hidden between the high cliffs of the steaming earth.    Finally the hour came when the sun broke through the clouds and saw how  this little planet was covered with a few small puddles which were to  develop into the mighty oceans of the eastern and western hemispheres.    Then one day the great wonder happened. What had been dead, gave birth  to life.    The first living cell floated upon the waters of the sea.    For millions of years it drifted aimlessly with the currents. But during  all that time it was developing certain habits that it might survive  more easily upon the inhospitable earth. Some of these cells were  happiest in the dark depths of the lakes and the pools. They took root  in the slimy sediments which had been carried down from the tops of the  hills and they became plants. Others preferred to move about and they  grew strange jointed legs, like scorpions and began to crawl along  the bottom of the sea amidst the plants and the pale green things that  looked like jelly-fishes. Still others (covered with scales) depended  upon a swimming motion to go from place to place in their search for  food, and gradually they populated the ocean with myriads of fishes.    Meanwhile the plants had increased in number and they had to search for  new dwelling places. There was no more room for them at the bottom of  the sea. Reluctantly they left the water and made a new home in the  "]]]
