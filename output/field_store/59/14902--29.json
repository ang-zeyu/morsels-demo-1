Before her was the rugged and picturesque stretch of country which lies  between the Orne and the Sarthe, above Alencon, and which is known as  Little Switzerland. Steep hills compelled her frequently to moderate her  pace, the more so as she had to cover some six miles before reaching her  destination. But, though the speed at which she rode became less headlong,  though her physical effort gradually slackened, she nevertheless persisted  in her indignation against Prince Renine. She bore him a grudge not only  for the unspeakable action of which he had been guilty, but also for his  behaviour to her during the last three days, his persistent attentions, his  assurance, his air of excessive politeness.    She was nearly there. In the bottom of a valley, an old park-wall, full  of cracks and covered with moss and weeds, revealed the ball-turret of a  chateau and a few windows with closed shutters. This was the Domaine de  Halingre.    She followed the wall and turned a corner. In the middle of the  crescent-shaped space before which lay the entrance-gates, Serge Renine  stood waiting beside his horse.    She sprang to the ground, and, as he stepped forward, hat in hand, thanking  her for coming, she cried:    \"One word, monsieur, to begin with. Something quite inexplicable happened  just now. Three shots were fired at a motor-car in which I was sitting. Did  you fire those shots?\"    \"Yes.\"    She seemed dumbfounded:    \"Then you confess it?\"    \"You have asked a question, madame, and I have answered it.\"    \"But how dared you? What gave you the right?\"    \"I was not exercising a right, madame; I was performing a duty!\"    \"Indeed! And what duty, pray?\"    \"The duty of protecting you against a man who is trying to profit by your  troubles.\"    \"I forbid you to speak like that. I am responsible for my own actions, and  I decided upon them in perfect liberty.\"    \"Madame, I overheard your conversation with M. Rossigny this morning and it  did not appear to me that you were accompanying him with a light heart. I  admit the ruthlessness and bad taste of my interference and I apologise for  it humbly; but I risked being taken for a ruffian in order to give you a  few hours for reflection.\"    \"I have reflected fully, monsieur. When I have once made up my mind to a  thing, I do not change it.\"    \"Yes, madame, you do, sometimes. If not, why are you here instead of  there?\"    Hortense was confused for a moment. All her anger had subsided. She looked  at Renine with the surprise which one experiences when confronted with  certain persons who are unlike their fellows, more capable of performing  unusual actions, more generous and disinterested. She realised perfectly  that he was acting without any ulterior motive or calculation, that he was,  as he had said, merely fulfilling his duty as a gentleman to a woman who  has taken the wrong turning.    Speaking very gently, he said:    \"I know very little about you, madame, but enough to make me wish to be of  use to you. You are twenty-six years old and have lost both your parents.  Seven years ago, you became the wife of the Comte d'Aigleroche's nephew by  marriage, who proved to be of unsound mind, half insane indeed, and had  to be confined. This made it impossible for you to obtain a divorce and  compelled you, since your dowry had been squandered, to live with your  uncle and at his expense. It's a depressing environment. The count and  countess do not agree. Years ago, the count was deserted by his first wife,  who ran away with the countess' first husband. The abandoned husband and  wife decided out of spite to unite their fortunes, but found nothing but  disappointment and ill-will in this second marriage. And you suffer the  consequences. They lead a monotonous, narrow, lonely life for eleven months  or more out of the year. One day, you met M. Rossigny, who fell in love  with you and suggested an elopement. You did not care for him. But you were  bored, your youth was being wasted, you longed for the unexpected, for  adventure ... in a word, you accepted with the very definite intention of  keeping your admirer at arm's length, but also with the rather ingenuous  hope that the scandal would force your uncle's hand and make him account  for his trusteeship and assure you of an independent existence. That is how  you stand. At present you have to choose between placing yourself in M.  Rossigny's hands ... or trusting yourself to me.\"    She raised her eyes to his. What did he mean? What was the purport of this  offer which he made so seriously, like a friend who asks nothing but to  prove his devotion?    After a moment's silence, he took the two horses by the bridle and tied  them up. Then he examined the heavy gates, each of which was strengthened  by two planks nailed cross-wise. An electoral poster, dated twenty years  earlier, showed that no one had entered the domain since that time.    Renine tore up one of the iron posts which supported a railing that ran  round the crescent and used it as a lever. The rotten planks gave way. One  of them uncovered the lock, which he attacked with a big knife, containing  a number of blades and implements. A minute later, the gate opened on a  waste of bracken which led up to a long, dilapidated building, with a  turret at each corner and a sort of a belvedere, built on a taller tower,  in the middle.    The Prince turned to Hortense:    \"You are in no hurry,\" he said. \"You will form your decision this evening;  and, if M. Rossigny succeeds in persuading you for the second time, I give  you my word of honour that I shall not cross your path. Until then, grant  me the privilege of your company. We made up our minds yesterday to inspect  the chateau. Let us do so. Will you? It is as good a way as any of passing  the time and I have a notion that it will not be uninteresting.\"    He had a way of talking which compelled obedience. He seemed to be  commanding and entreating at the same time. Hortense did not even seek  to shake off the enervation into which her will was slowly sinking. She  followed him to a half-demolished flight of steps at the top of which was  a door likewise strengthened by planks nailed in the form of a cross.    Renine went to work in the same way as before. They entered a spacious  hall paved with white and black flagstones, furnished with old sideboards  and choir-stalls and adorned with a carved escutcheon which displayed the  remains of armorial bearings, representing an eagle standing on a block of  stone, all half-hidden behind a veil of cobwebs which hung down over a pair  of folding-doors.    \"The door of the drawing-room, evidently,\" said Renine.    He found this more difficult to open; and it was only by repeatedly  charging it with his shoulder that he was able to move one of the doors.    Hortense had not spoken a word. She watched not without surprise this  series of forcible entries, which were accomplished with a really masterly  skill. He guessed her thoughts and, turning round, said in a serious voice:    \"It's child's-play to me. I was a locksmith once.\"    She seized his arm and whispered:    \"Listen!\"    \"To what?\" he asked.    She increased the pressure of her hand, to demand silence. The next moment,  he murmured:    \"It's really very strange.\"    \"Listen, listen!\" Hortense repeated, in bewilderment. \"Can it be possible?\"    They heard, not far from where they were standing, a sharp sound, the sound  of a light tap recurring at regular intervals; and they had only to listen  attentively to recognise the ticking of a clock. Yes, it was this and  nothing else that broke the profound silence of the dark room; it was  indeed the deliberate ticking, rhythmical as the beat of a metronome,  produced by a heavy brass pendulum. That was it! And nothing could be more  impressive than the measured pulsation of this trivial mechanism, which by  some miracle, some inexplicable phenomenon, had continued to live in the  heart of the dead chateau.    \"And yet,\" stammered Hortense, without daring to raise her voice, \"no one  has entered the house?\"    \"No one.\"    \"And it is quite impossible for that clock to have kept going for twenty  years without being wound up?\"    \"Quite impossible.\"    \"Then ...?\"    Serge Renine opened the three windows and threw back the shutters.    He and Hortense were in a drawing-room, as he had thought; and the room  showed not the least sign of disorder. The chairs were in their places. Not  a piece of furniture was missing. The people who had lived there and who  had made it the most individual room in their house had gone away leaving  everything just as it was, the books which they used to read, the  knick-knacks on the tables and consoles.    Renine examined the old grandfather's clock, contained in its tall carved  case which showed the disk of the pendulum through an oval pane of glass.  He opened the door of the clock. The weights hanging from the cords were at  their lowest point.    At that moment there was a click. The clock struck eight with a serious  note which Hortense was never to forget.    \"How extraordinary!\" she said.    \"Extraordinary indeed,\" said he, \"for the works are exceedingly simple and  would hardly keep going for a week.\"    \"And do you see nothing out of the common?\"    \"No, nothing ... or, at least....\"    He stooped and, from the back of the case, drew a metal tube which was  concealed by the weights. Holding it up to the light:    \"A telescope,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"Why did they hide it?... And they  left it drawn out to its full length.... That's odd.... What does it mean?\"    The clock, as is sometimes usual, began to strike a second time, sounding  eight strokes. Renine closed the case and continued his inspection without  putting his telescope down. A wide arch led from the drawing-room to a  smaller apartment, a sort of smoking-room. This also was furnished, but  contained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#2)"],[1,"of the sect of  Camissards, and an historical account of its origin. His mind was in a  state peculiarly fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments. The  craving which had haunted him was now supplied with an object. His mind  was at no loss for a theme of meditation. On days of business, he rose  at the dawn, and retired to his chamber not till late at night. He now  supplied himself with candles, and employed his nocturnal and Sunday  hours in studying this book. It, of course, abounded with allusions to  the Bible. All its conclusions were deduced from the sacred text. This  was the fountain, beyond which it was unnecessary to trace the stream of  religious truth; but it was his duty to trace it thus far.    A Bible was easily procured, and he ardently entered on the study of it.  His understanding had received a particular direction. All his reveries  were fashioned in the same mould. His progress towards the formation of  his creed was rapid. Every fact and sentiment in this book were viewed  through a medium which the writings of the Camissard apostle had  suggested. His constructions of the text were hasty, and formed on a  narrow scale. Every thing was viewed in a disconnected position. One  action and one precept were not employed to illustrate and restrict  the meaning of another. Hence arose a thousand scruples to which he had  hitherto been a stranger. He was alternately agitated by fear and by  ecstacy. He imagined himself beset by the snares of a spiritual foe, and  that his security lay in ceaseless watchfulness and prayer.    His morals, which had never been loose, were now modelled by a stricter  standard. The empire of religious duty extended itself to his looks,  gestures, and phrases. All levities of speech, and negligences of  behaviour, were proscribed. His air was mournful and contemplative.  He laboured to keep alive a sentiment of fear, and a belief of  the awe-creating presence of the Deity. Ideas foreign to this were  sedulously excluded. To suffer their intrusion was a crime against the  Divine Majesty inexpiable but by days and weeks of the keenest agonies.    No material variation had occurred in the lapse of two years. Every day  confirmed him in his present modes of thinking and acting. It was to  be expected that the tide of his emotions would sometimes recede, that  intervals of despondency and doubt would occur; but these gradually were  more rare, and of shorter duration; and he, at last, arrived at a state  considerably uniform in this respect.    His apprenticeship was now almost expired. On his arrival of age he  became entitled, by the will of my grand-father, to a small sum. This  sum would hardly suffice to set him afloat as a trader in his present  situation, and he had nothing to expect from the generosity of his  master. Residence in England had, besides, become almost impossible,  on account of his religious tenets. In addition to these motives for  seeking a new habitation, there was another of the most imperious and  irresistable necessity. He had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty  to disseminate the truths of the gospel among the unbelieving nations.  He was terrified at first by the perils and hardships to which the life  of a missionary is exposed. This cowardice made him diligent in the  invention of objections and excuses; but he found it impossible wholly  to shake off the belief that such was the injunction of his duty.  The belief, after every new conflict with his passions, acquired new  strength; and, at length, he formed a resolution of complying with what  he deemed the will of heaven.    The North-American Indians naturally presented themselves as the first  objects for this species of benevolence. As soon as his servitude  expired, he converted his little fortune into money, and embarked for  Philadelphia. Here his fears were revived, and a nearer survey of savage  manners once more shook his resolution. For a while he relinquished his  purpose, and purchasing a farm on Schuylkill, within a few miles of the  city, set himself down to the cultivation of it. The cheapness of land,  and the service of African slaves, which were then in general use,  gave him who was poor in Europe all the advantages of wealth. He passed  fourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner. In this time new  objects, new employments, and new associates appeared to have nearly  obliterated the devout impressions of his youth. He now became  acquainted with a woman of a meek and quiet disposition, and of slender  acquirements like himself. He proffered his hand and was accepted.    His previous industry had now enabled him to dispense with personal  labour, and direct attention to his own concerns. He enjoyed leisure,  and was visited afresh by devotional contemplation. The reading of the  scriptures, and other religious books, became once more his favorite  employment. His ancient belief relative to the conversion of the savage  tribes, was revived with uncommon energy. To the former obstacles were  now added the pleadings of parental and conjugal love. The struggle  was long and vehement; but his sense of duty would not be stifled or  enfeebled, and finally triumphed over every impediment.    His efforts were attended with no permanent success. His exhortations  had sometimes a temporary power, but more frequently were repelled with  insult and derision. In pursuit of this object he encountered the most  imminent perils, and underwent incredible fatigues, hunger, sickness,  and solitude. The licence of savage passion, and the artifices of his  depraved countrymen, all opposed themselves to his progress. His courage  did not forsake him till there appeared no reasonable ground to hope for  success. He desisted not till his heart was relieved from the supposed  obligation to persevere. With his constitution somewhat decayed, he at  length returned to his family. An interval of tranquillity succeeded. He  was frugal, regular, and strict in the performance of domestic duties.  He allied himself with no sect, because he perfectly agreed with none.  Social worship is that by which they are all distinguished; but this  article found no place in his creed. He rigidly interpreted that precept  which enjoins us, when we worship, to retire into solitude, and shut  out every species of society. According to him devotion was not only a  silent office, but must be performed alone. An hour at noon, and an hour  at midnight were thus appropriated.    At the distance of three hundred yards from his house, on the top of a  rock whose sides were steep, rugged, and encumbered with dwarf cedars  and stony asperities, he built what to a common eye would have seemed a  summer-house. The eastern verge of this precipice was sixty feet above  the river which flowed at its foot. The view before it consisted of a  transparent current, fluctuating and rippling in a rocky channel, and  bounded by a rising scene of cornfields and orchards. The edifice was  slight and airy. It was no more than a circular area, twelve feet in  diameter, whose flooring was the rock, cleared of moss and shrubs, and  exactly levelled, edged by twelve Tuscan columns, and covered by an  undulating dome. My father furnished the dimensions and outlines, but  allowed the artist whom he employed to complete the structure on his own  plan. It was without seat, table, or ornament of any kind.    This was the temple of his Deity. Twice in twenty-four hours he repaired  hither, unaccompanied by any human being. Nothing but physical inability  to move was allowed to obstruct or postpone this visit. He did not exact  from his family compliance with his example. Few men, equally sincere  in their faith, were as sparing in their censures and restrictions,  with respect to the conduct of others, as my father. The character of  my mother was no less devout; but her education had habituated her to  a different mode of worship. The loneliness of their dwelling prevented  her from joining any established congregation; but she was punctual in  the offices of prayer, and in the performance of hymns to her Saviour,  after the manner of the disciples of Zinzendorf. My father refused  to interfere in her arrangements. His own system was embraced not,  accurately speaking, because it was the best, but because it had been  expressly prescribed to him. Other modes, if practised by other persons,  might be equally acceptable.    His deportment to others was full of charity and mildness. A sadness  perpetually overspread his features, but was unmingled with sternness or  discontent. The tones of his voice, his gestures, his steps were all in  tranquil unison. His conduct was characterised by a certain forbearance  and humility, which secured the esteem of those to whom his tenets were  most obnoxious. They might call him a fanatic and a dreamer, but they  could not deny their veneration to his invincible candour and invariable  integrity. His own belief of rectitude was the foundation of his  happiness. This, however, was destined to find an end.    Suddenly the sadness that constantly attended him was deepened. Sighs,  and even tears, sometimes escaped him. To the expostulations of his wife  he seldom answered any thing. When he designed to be communicative, he  hinted that his peace of mind was flown, in consequence of deviation  from his duty. A command had been laid upon him, which he had delayed to  perform. He felt as if a certain period of hesitation and reluctance  had been allowed him, but that this period was passed. He was no  longer permitted to obey. The duty assigned to him was transferred, in  consequence of his disobedience, to another, and all that remained was  to endure the penalty.    He did not describe this penalty. It appeared to be nothing more for  some time than a sense of wrong. This was sufficiently acute, and was  aggravated by the belief that his offence was incapable of expiation. No  one could"]]]
