Three blasts he gave as he went upon that silver horn that is the  world-old treasure of the centaurs. These were his wedding bells.        DISTRESSING TALE OF THANGOBRIND THE JEWELLER      When Thangobrind the jeweller heard the ominous cough, he turned at  once upon that narrow way. A thief was he, of very high repute, being  patronized by the lofty and elect, for he stole nothing smaller than  the Moomoo's egg, and in all his life stole only four kinds of  stone--the ruby, the diamond, the emerald, and the sapphire; and, as  jewellers go, his honesty was great. Now there was a Merchant Prince  who had come to Thangobrind and had offered his daughter's soul for  the diamond that is larger than the human head and was to be found on  the lap of the spider-idol, Hlo-hlo, in his temple of Moung-ga-ling;  for he had heard that Thangobrind was a thief to be trusted.    Thangobrind oiled his body and slipped out of his shop, and went  secretly through byways, and got as far as Snarp, before anybody knew  that he was out on business again or missed his sword from its place  under the counter. Thence he moved only by night, hiding by day and  rubbing the edges of his sword, which he called Mouse because it was  swift and nimble. The jeweller had subtle methods of travelling;  nobody saw him cross the plains of Zid; nobody saw him come to Mursk  or Tlun. O, but he loved shadows! Once the moon peeping out  unexpectedly from a tempest had betrayed an ordinary jeweller; not so  did it undo Thangobrind: the watchman only saw a crouching shape that  snarled and laughed: \"'Tis but a hyena,\" they said. Once in the city  of Ag one of the guardians seized him, but Thangobrind was oiled and  slipped from his hand; you scarcely heard his bare feet patter away.  He knew that the Merchant Prince awaited his return, his little eyes  open all night and glittering with greed; he knew how his daughter lay  chained up and screaming night and day. Ah, Thangobrind knew. And had  he not been out on business he had almost allowed himself one or two  little laughs. But business was business, and the diamond that he  sought still lay on the lap of Hlo-hlo, where it had been for the last  two million years since Hlo-hlo created the world and gave unto it all  things except that precious stone called Dead Man's Diamond. The jewel  was often stolen, but it had a knack of coming back again to the lap  of Hlo-hlo. Thangobrind knew this, but he was no common jeweller and  hoped to outwit Hlo-hlo, perceiving not the trend of ambition and lust  and that they are vanity.    How nimbly he threaded his way through he pits of Snood!--now like a  botanist, scrutinising the ground; now like a dancer, leaping from  crumbling edges. It was quite dark when he went by the towers of Tor,  where archers shoot ivory arrows at strangers lest any foreigner should  alter their laws, which are bad, but not to be altered by mere aliens.  At night they shoot by the sound of the strangers' feet. O, Thangobrind,  Thangobrind, was ever a jeweller like you! He dragged two stones behind  him by long cords, and at these the archers shot. Tempting indeed was  the snare that they set in Woth, the emeralds loose-set in the city's  gate; but Thangobrind discerned the golden cord that climbed the wall  from each and the weights that would topple upon him if he touched one,  and so he left them, though he left them weeping, and at last came to  Theth. There all men worship Hlo-hlo; though they are willing to believe  in other gods, as missionaries attest, but only as creatures of the  chase for the hunting of Hlo-hlo, who wears Their halos, so these people  say, on golden hooks along his hunting-belt. And from Theth he came to  the city of Moung and the temple of Moung-ga-ling, and entered and saw  the spider-idol, Hlo-hlo, sitting there with Dead Man's Diamond  glittering on his lap, and looking for all the world like a full moon,  but a full moon seen by a lunatic who had slept too long in its rays,  for there was in Dead Man's Diamond a certain sinister look and a boding  of things to happen that are better not mentioned here. The face of the  spider-idol was lit by that fatal gem; there was no other light. In  spite of his shocking limbs and that demoniac body, his face was serene  and apparently unconscious.    A little fear came into the mind of Thangobrind the jeweller, a  passing tremor--no more; business was business and he hoped for the  best. Thangobrind offered honey to Hlo-hlo and prostrated himself  before him. Oh, he was cunning! When the priests stole out of the  darkness to lap up the honey they were stretched senseless on the  temple floor, for there was a drug in the honey that was offered to  Hlo-hlo. And Thangobrind the jeweller picked Dead Man's Diamond up and  put it on his shoulder and trudged away from the shrine; and Hlo-hlo  the spider-idol said nothing at all, but he laughed softly as the  jeweller shut the door. When the priests awoke out of the grip of the  drug that was offered with the honey to Hlo-hlo, they rushed to a  little secret room with an outlet on the stars and cast a horoscope of  the thief. Something that they saw in the horoscope seemed to satisfy  the priests.    It was not like Thangobrind to go back by the road by which he had  come. No, he went by another road, even though it led to the narrow  way, night-house and spider-forest.    The city of Moung went towering by behind him, balcony above balcony,  eclipsing half the stars, as he trudged away with his diamond. Though  when a soft pittering as of velvet feet arose behind him he refused to  acknowledge that it might be what he feared, yet the instincts of his  trade told him that it is not well when any noise whatever follows a  diamond by night, and this was one of the largest that had ever come to  him in the way of business. When he came to the narrow way that leads to  spider-forest, Dead Man's Diamond feeling cold and heavy, and the  velvety footfall seeming fearfully close, the jeweller stopped and  almost hesitated. He looked behind him; there was nothing there. He  listened attentively; there was no sound now. Then he thought of the  screams of the Merchant Prince's daughter, whose soul was the diamond's  price, and smiled and went stoutly on. There watched him, apathetically,  over the narrow way, that grim and dubious woman whose house is the Night.  Thangobrind, hearing no longer the sound of suspicious feet, felt easier  now. He was all but come to the end of the narrow way, when the woman  listlessly uttered that ominous cough.    The cough was too full of meaning to be disregarded. Thangobrind turned  round and saw at once what he feared. The spider-idol had not stayed at  home. The jeweller put his diamond gently upon the ground and drew his  sword called Mouse. And then began that famous fight upon the narrow way  in which the grim old woman whose house was Night seemed to take so  little interest. To the spider-idol you saw at once it was all a  horrible joke. To the jeweller it was grim earnest. He fought and panted  and was pushed back slowly along the narrow way, but he wounded Hlo-hlo  all the while with terrible long gashes all over his deep, soft body  till Mouse was slimy with blood. But at last the persistent laughter of  Hlo-hlo was too much for the jeweller's nerves, and, once more wounding  his demoniac foe, he sank aghast and exhausted by the door of the house  called Night at the feet of the grim old woman, who having uttered once  that ominous cough interfered no further with the course of events. And  there carried Thangobrind the jeweller away those whose duty it was, to  the house where the two men hang, and taking down from his hook the  left-hand one of the two, they put that venturous jeweller in his place;  so that there fell on him the doom that he feared, as all men know  though it is so long since, and there abated somewhat the ire of the  envious gods.    And the only daughter of the Merchant Prince felt so little gratitude  for this great deliverance that she took to respectability of a  militant kind, and became aggressively dull, and called her home the  English Riviera, and had platitudes worked in worsted upon her  tea-cosy, and in the end never died, but passed away at her residence.        THE HOUSE OF THE SPHINX      When I came to the House of the Sphinx it was already dark. They made  me eagerly welcome. And I, in spite of the deed, was glad of any  shelter from that ominous wood. I saw at once that there had been a  deed, although a cloak did all that a cloak may do to conceal it. The  mere uneasiness of the welcome made me suspect that cloak.    The Sphinx was moody and silent. I had not come to pry into the  secrets of Eternity nor to investigate the Sphinx's private life, and  so had little to say and few questions to ask; but to whatever I did  say she remained morosely indifferent. It was clear that either she  suspected me of being in search of the secrets of one of her gods, or  of being boldly inquisitive about her traffic with Time, or else she  was darkly absorbed with brooding upon the deed.    I saw soon enough that there was another than me to welcome; I saw it  from the hurried way that they glanced from the door to the deed and  back to the door again. And it was clear that the welcome was to be a  bolted door. But such bolts, and such a door! Rust and decay and  fungus had been there far too long, and it was not a barrier any  longer that would keep out even a determined wolf. And it seemed to be  something worse than a wolf that they feared.    A little later on I gathered from what they said that some imperious  and ghastly thing was looking for the Sphinx, and that something that  had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#2)"],[1,"other,  \"if you can't go, I'll--I'll give it up, and stay at home.\"    \"And why should you stay at home?\" cried Polly, suddenly giving him a  glimpse of her face; \"you've lovely seats; do ask Alexia.\"    \"Alexia!\" exclaimed Pickering angrily. \"Indeed I will not. I don't want  any one if I can't have you, Polly.\" He was really miserable now, and  needed comfort, so she turned around and administered it as only Polly  could.    By the time the talk was over, she hurried off with a radiant face, and  Pickering with an expression only one remove from that of absolute  gloom, retraced his steps to lay one of \"the lovely seats\" for the  D'Albert concert, before Miss Rhys, for her acceptance.    Phronsie came slowly down the hall to meet Polly as usual; this day with  one of her company white gowns on. Polly always knew when these were  donned that something unusual was to be expected from the daily routine  of the household.    \"Are you really and truly home, Polly?\" asked Phronsie, taking the  music-roll to tuck it under her own arm.    \"Yes, Pet;\" Polly set a kiss on the red lips. \"And I am as hungry as a  beaver, Phronsie.\"    \"So you must be,\" said Phronsie, with a little sigh, \"for you were so  long in coming home. Well, do hurry now, Polly.\" This last as Polly was  skipping over the stairs to her own room to freshen up a bit. Then  Phronsie turned into the dining-room to be quite sure that the butler  had made the belated luncheon as fine as Polly could desire it.    \"She didn't ask why I had on this gown,\" mused Phronsie, softly  disposing again the flowers at Polly's plate, \"and it's funny, I think,  for Polly always sees everything;\" and she began to look troubled at  once.    [Illustration: PHRONSIE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE HALL.]    \"This is just as splendid as it can be,\" cried Polly, coming in, and  picking up one of the roses at her plate. \"Phronsie, you are just a dear  to have everything so nice,\" and she fastened it at her belt. \"Why, dear  me! You've a fine gown on! What is going to happen?\"    \"And you didn't see it,\" said Phronsie, a bit reproachfully, as she  gently smoothed the front breadth of mull.    \"Forgive me, dear,\" begged Polly. \"Well, what is it, Pet? Do tell me;  for I'm dying of curiosity, as the Salisbury girls say.\"    Phronsie stood up on tiptoe, and achieved Polly's ear.    \"Who do you think is coming to-night?\" she whispered impressively.    \"To-night? Oh, dear me! I can't possibly guess,\" said Polly, beginning  to think that this one evening of all the year held supreme moments for  her. \"Who is it, Phronsie? do tell me quickly.\"    \"Well,\" said Phronsie, drawing off to see the surprised delight sure to  come on Polly's face, \"it's Jasper himself.\"    \"Not Jasper?\" exclaimed Polly, quite gone with joy. \"Oh, Phronsie  Pepper, you can't mean that?\"    \"But I do,\" said Phronsie, forgetting her age, to hop up and down on the  rug, \"we've a letter while you were at the school, and I wasn't to tell  you suddenly, so I put on one of my nice gowns, so you would know.\"    \"But how could I possibly suppose that Jasper would come now,\" cried  Polly, seizing Phronsie's hands to execute one of the old-time dances.  \"Now I almost know he is going to stay over Christmas.\"    \"He is--he is!\" cried Phronsie in a little scream; \"you've guessed it,  Polly. And Mamsie said--she's gone down town with Grandpapa; he's going  to get tickets for the concert to-night, so that you can all go  together, even if you can't sit together, and she said that\"--    \"Oh, Phronsie!\" exclaimed Polly in dismay and she stood quite still.    \"Aren't you glad?\" asked Phronsie, her joy suddenly hushed.    \"And I've done it myself--spoiled all this loveliness,\" cried Polly  passionately, little white lines coming around her mouth, \"and Jasper  here!\"    \"Oh, Polly, Polly!\" Phronsie clasped her gown imploringly, \"don't,  Polly.\"    \"I just won't go to the school,\" declared Polly at white heat; \"I don't  care for the concert, but I'll send a note over to say that I am  detained at home.\"    \"What is it, Polly?\" begged Phronsie, all sorts of dreadful surmises  seizing her, \"do tell me, Polly, won't you?\"    \"It's--nothing; you wouldn't understand, child,\" said Polly quickly.  \"There, don't ask.\"    Phronsie crept away in a grieved fashion, to be presently folded into  Polly's warm arms. \"I'm bad to-day, Phronsie dear. There, Pet, now you  are all right, aren't you?\" as she hugged her close.    \"I am, if you are, Polly,\" said Phronsie doubtfully.    \"Well, I'm all right now,\" said Polly, her brow clearing; \"the bad has  gone at last, I hope, to stay away, Phronsie. Now I must hurry and eat  this nice luncheon you've fixed for me;\" and she sprang toward the  table.    \"Don't you want to write a note first?\" asked Phronsie, wondering at  Polly's strange mood, and following her to the table-edge, \"you said  so.\"    \"No; I've given it up,\" said Polly, sitting down and beginning on her  chop and toast. \"Bless you, dear, you've given me an orchid,\" glancing  down between her mouthfuls to the bouquet at her plate; \"you should have  saved them all for Jasper.\"    \"Turner said I might have it,\" said Phronsie triumphantly, \"and I knew  you'd give it to Jasper, so it's all right.\"    \"It surely shall do double duty,\" said Polly merrily, with a tender  glance for the orchid. \"Well, how's Baby?\"    \"He is very nice,\" said Phronsie, with a grown-up air, \"and didn't cry a  bit for Mamsie. And now if you are really all right, Polly, I'll go up  to the nursery and look at him.\"    \"So I would,\" said Polly approvingly. \"Yes, I'm all right; see, I'm on  my chop No. 2.\"    Phronsie smiled with great satisfaction at this, and went off. At a  quarter of seven, Polly, in a storm of remonstrance from all but one,  hurried off to help poor Amy Loughead through her Slough of Despond.    Jasper alone, just arrived for dinner, was the only one who remained  silent when the storm of disapproval broke forth over Polly and her  doings. After the first astonished exclamation, he had absolutely  refused to say anything save \"Polly knows best.\"    \"I don't know how to thank you,\" said Polly out in the wide hall, where  he hurried to meet her, as she ran downstairs with her plainest walking  things on, \"for I don't believe they would have let me go. I never saw  Mamsie feel so, Jasper.\" And now Polly could not keep the tears back.    \"She'll see it all right to-morrow,\" said Jasper soothingly.    He put his hand out and grasped hers, as in the old days in the little  brown house, and Polly answered through her tears, \"I know, Jasper.\"    And then the maid appearing, who was to accompany her to Miss  Salisbury's, Polly came out from her tears, and said, \"I'm ready,  Barbara.\"    \"You are not needed, Barbara,\" said Jasper, reaching up for his top-coat  from the oaken rack.    \"What are you going to do?\" gasped Polly, her hand on the door-knob, and  glancing back.    \"Walk over with you to that center of culture and wisdom,\" said Jasper  coolly, close beside her now, his hat in his hand.    \"O, Jasper!\" exclaimed Polly in dismay, her face growing quite pale,  \"don't; you'll be late for the concert. Barbara, Barbara!\" Polly looked  past him to summon the departing maid.    \"Barbara is a good girl, and understands the duty of obedience,\" said  Jasper laughingly. \"There's no help for it, Polly; you must accept my  escort,\" and he opened the door.    \"But Grandpapa! he will be terribly disappointed not to have you go to  the concert with him,\" cried Polly, getting down the steps with a  dreadful weight at her heart.    \"I made it all right with father,\" said Jasper, \"as soon as I heard of  your plan; and Mr. Alstyne is on his way over to take my place; at least  he ought to be in response to my note. Don't worry, Polly; come.\"    \"Oh! what perfectly elegant seats,\" exclaimed Alexia Rhys, waving her  big ostrich fan contentedly, and sweeping the audience with a long gaze.  \"Everybody is here to-night, Pickering.\"    \"That's not so,\" said Pickering savagely, and bestowing a thump on his  unoffending opera hat, already reduced to the smallest possible bulk.    \"Don't spoil it,\" advised Alexia coolly, with a sidelong gaze at his  face. \"Well, of course I mean everybody except Polly; and I'm sure,  Pickering, it isn't my fault that she didn't come; Polly always was  queer about some things.\"    Pickering did not answer, but bestowed his glance on the programme in  his hand.    \"And now she is queerer than ever,\" said Alexia, glad to think that the  dainty blue affair on her head, she called a bonnet, was already doing  its work, as she heard a lady in the seat back of them, question if it  were not one of the newest of Madame Marchaud's creations. So she sat  more erect, and played nonchalantly with her fan. \"Yes, and it's all  because of those dreadfully horrid music lessons.\"    Pickering coughed, and rattled his programme ominously, which Alexia  pretended not to hear.    \"Why Mr. King lets her do it, I can't see,\" she went on.    \"Do stop,\" said Pickering shortly, and casting a nervous glance back of  her shoulder.    \"Never mind if they do hear,\" said Alexia sweetly, \"all the better; then  they'll know we don't approve of her doing so, at any rate.\"    \"I do approve,\" said Pickering, his face flaming, \"if she wants to; and  we've got to, any way, because we can't help ourselves. I do wish,  Alexia, you wouldn't discuss our friends in this public way.\"    \"And I don't think it is a very sweet thing to invite a girl to a  concert, and then get up a fight,\" said Alexia, back at him.    \"Goodness--who's fighting?\" exclaimed Pickering under his breath.    \"You are--I wish you could see your face; it's as black as a thunder  cloud,\" said Alexia, with the consciousness that her own was as calm as  a June morning. \"And I'm sure if you don't want to attract people to our  conversation, you might at least look a little pleasanter.\"    Pickering threw two or three nervous"]]]
