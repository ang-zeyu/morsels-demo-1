It was the means by which  Adam, our great ancestor, after his expulsion from Eden, regained the  divine presence from which he had been banished. It is the means by  which his posterity, such as are obedient to the gospel's requirements,  have been or will yet be able to follow him into the heavenly kingdom.  The same ladder that Adam climbed, until beyond the reach of the fatal  consequences of his transgression, the whole human race, inheriting  from him the effects of the fall, must likewise climb, or they will  never see the face of God in eternal glory.    The Paramount Purpose.--Let us keep in mind, however, that the gospel,  even in a limited sense, is more than a means of escape from impending  ills. It is the way of progress, the path to perfection, and as such  was devised by the wisdom of the Gods, before this world rolled into  existence. The origin of the gospel, and the grand purpose for which it  was instituted, are briefly yet clearly outlined by the Prophet Joseph  Smith in the following language:    Eternal Progression.--\"The first principles of man are self-existent  with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and  glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws  whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The  relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance  in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker  intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself, so that they may  have one glory upon another.\"--(\"Times and Seasons,\" August 15, 1844;  \"Improvement Era,\" January, 1909.)    Power and Benevolence of Deity.--Here are pointed out both the power  and the benevolence of Deity. Our Father in heaven is no monopolist.  While omnipotent and all-possessing, he is likewise altruistic and  philanthropic. Instead of keeping to himself the glory that he found  himself possessed of, he used his superior intelligence \"to institute  laws\" whereby the lesser spirits surrounding him might advance toward  the lofty plane that he occupies. He proposed to lift them to his own  spiritual stature and share with them the empire of the universe.    Plato's View.--Our prophet's simple yet sublime setting forth of the  divine power and benevolence, as exemplified in the establishment of a  plan for man's eternal progress, is far more pointed and specific than  the presentment made by Plato, the Greek philosopher, of a doctrine  somewhat similar. Plato, as quoted by Emerson, says: \"Let us declare  the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and compose the  universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of envy. Exempt  from envy, he wished that all things should be as much as possible  like himself. Whosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit this as the  prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world, will be in the  truth.\"--(\"Representative Men,\" Lecture II.)    Man's Destiny.--There is a fitness, a propriety, in man's becoming  like his Maker--God's child, fashioned in his image and endowed with  divine attributes, developing to the fulness of the parental stature,  as taught by Joseph; but how the same can be predicated of \"all  things\"--beasts, fish, fowl, trees, plants, etc., as Plato implies, is  not so clear. That the lower animals, as well as man, in fact all forms  of life, animate and inanimate, are to be perpetuated and glorified, is  a plain inference from the teachings of the prophet (D&C 77:2-4) but  undoubtedly all will retain their identity, in their respective orders  and spheres. No creature of God's, except man, is destined to become  like God, in the fullest and highest sense. \"As much as possible\" is a  saving clause, however, and Plato, therefore, is not committed to any  contradictory proposition.        CHAPTER II.    Eternal Nature of Gospel Principles.    Gospel Code and Fundamentals.--The gospel, as a code or System of  laws and ordinances, is a creation, a work of God; but like all  other creations it was organized out of materials already existing.  \"Intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made, neither  indeed can be\" (D&C 93:29). Truth, \"eternal, unchanged, evermore\"--such  is the gospel in its fundamental principles. These were never created.  God did not make them; he \"instituted\" them, recognizing their worth,  their utility, their adaptability to the purposes which he had in view.  He saw that these principles were ennobling and exalting in their  nature and tendency, and he therefore created a plan embodying them as  the most effectual means for man's promotion.    Faith.--Take, for instance, faith--the first principle. Can you  conceive of its creation as a principle? I cannot: but I can grasp the  idea of its existence as a law, as an essential force, its adoption  by divine wisdom, and its adaptation to the purposes of Deity. I  can conceive of its bestowal upon man as an endowment from God, its  assimilation, cultivation, growth and increase, as illustrated in the  Book of Mormon, where it is compared to a seed germinating in the soul  (Alma 32:28). But I cannot think of it, in its essential, fundamental  nature, as having been called into existence. Faith is a gift from God,  both as a law and a manifestation of spiritual power: but it is not a  creation--not as a basic principle. The gospel code containing this  law, however, may readily be conceived as the work of a divine Creator  and Law-giver.    Repentance.--What is true of faith in this respect, is true also of  repentance. God did not create repentance as a principle; it already  existed as an essential to progress; but he made it obligatory upon  sinful man, if he would be saved and put upon the road to perfection,  to practice this principle--to turn away from evil and \"sin no more.\"    Baptism.--As for baptism, the idea of washing in order to be come clean  is plain enough for a child's comprehension. It is this idea that  underlies the baptismal ordinance. God did not create the fact that  washing maketh clean--that is fundamental; but he instituted baptism  for the remission of sins and made it a part of the gospel plan,  because no unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven.    Holy Ghost.--Divine Wisdom did not create the Holy Ghost: he is  eternal, without beginning or end--he is God. Nor did it decree light  necessary to illumination; that is a self-evident, self-existent truth.  But Divine Wisdom instituted the laying on of hands for the gift  (giving) of the Holy Ghost, and included it in the great progressive  plan, because, without the illumination that comes from the Spirit of  the Lord, man cannot be \"led into all truth.\"    Thus we might go on, taking up other features of the gospel, and in  each one pointing out some underlying principle upon which this law or  that ordinance has been based. The same philosophy will apply to them  all. These fundamental principles are not creations--they are eternal  truths, applied or adapted to ends foreseen and predestined by the  all-wise Ordainer and Giver.    The gospel was instituted for the advancement of God's children,  who had probably progressed as far as they could in the spirit at  that time, before they were given bodies; and it was made effective  for their further progress by the Atonement of Christ, offsetting  the fall of Adam, and nullifying the deadly effects of the original  transgression.    The Fall.--Right here let me suggest that Adam's transgression, while  technically a sin, because of the broken law, should be stressed as  the means whereby those spirits obtained their bodies, rather than  as an act of moral turpitude. In law, crimes are of two general  classes--malum per se and malum prohibitum. Malum per se means \"an evil  in itself\"--an act essentially wrong; while malum prohibitum signifies  \"that which is wrong because forbidden by law.\" Adam's transgression  was malum prohibitum, and the consequent descent from an immortal to a  mortal condition was \"THE FALL.\"    A Prearranged Plan.--It is evident from the revelations of God,  particularly in modern times, that everything connected with man's  mortal pilgrimage was understood and arranged before that pilgrimage  began. Not alone was the gospel instituted: an executor was appointed  to put it into effect. In other words, the machinery was constructed,  and the power then turned on. The fall being foreseen, the redemption  was ordained. Eternal progress and everlasting glory were the objects  in view, and over the glad prospect, in spite of the pain and sorrow  that must necessarily intervene, \"the Morning Stars sang together, and  all the Sons of God shouted for joy\" (Job 38:7).        CHAPTER III.    The Fall and Redemption.    Essentials to Progress.--The story of God embraces the fall as well  as the redemption of man. Both these mighty vicissitudes are steps in  the march of human progress. The fall was just as necessary as the  redemption, in order to make operative and effective the laws and  ordinances of the gospel. In other words, the fall prepared the way for  the redemption. How could redemption have been, had there been nothing  to redeem? Of what use were a gospel of salvation where nothing needed  to be saved?    Innocent Ignorance.--Had the spirits of men, \"all innocent in the  beginning,\" remained where they were and just as they were, they would  have had no need to exercise faith unto salvation. They would have  had no need to repent or to be baptized, having no evil practices to  turn away from, and no uncleanness to be washed away. But they would  have remained ignorant as well as innocent, and without any further  progression. The following passage from the Book of Mormon illustrates  this point:    \"And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have  fallen; but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all  things which were created must have remained in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#2)"],[1,"all their branches? Whither are they taken?\"    \"We know! we know!\" chirped the Sparrows. \"We have peeped in at the  windows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest  splendour and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. We  peeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the  warm room, and ornamented with the most splendid things--with gilded  apples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!\"    \"And then?\" asked the Fir-tree, trembling in every bough. \"And then?  What happens then?\"    \"We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.\"    \"I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career,\" cried  the Tree, rejoicing. \"That is still better than to cross the sea! What  a longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my  branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh,  were I but already on the cart. Were I in the warm room with all the  splendour and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still  grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me?  Something better, something still grander, MUST follow--but what? Oh,  how I long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with  me!\"    \"Rejoice in our presence!\" said the Air and the Sunlight; \"rejoice in  thy own fresh youth!\"    But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green  both winter and summer. People that saw him said, \"What a fine tree!\"  and toward Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe  struck deep into the very pith; the tree fell to the earth with a sigh:  he felt a pang--it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,  for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place  where he had sprung up. He knew well that he should never see his  dear old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, any more;  perhaps not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.    The Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with  the other trees, and heard a man say, \"That one is splendid! we don't  want the others.\" Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the  Fir-tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging  on the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese  vases with lions on the covers. There, too, were large easy chairs,  silken sofas, large tables full of picture-books, and full of toys worth  hundreds and hundreds of crowns--at least the children said so. And the  Fir-tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand: but no  one could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all around  it, and it stood on a large gayly coloured carpet. Oh, how the Tree  quivered! What was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies,  decorated it. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of coloured  paper, and each net was filled with sugar-plums; and among the other  boughs gilded apples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they  had grown there, and little blue and white tapers were placed among the  leaves. Dolls that looked for all the world like men--the Tree had never  beheld such before--were seen among the foliage, and at the very top  a large star of gold tinsel was fixed. It was really splendid--beyond  description splendid.    \"This evening!\" said they all; \"how it will shine this evening!\"    \"Oh,\" thought the Tree, \"if the evening were but come! If the tapers  were but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other  trees from the forest will come to look at me! Perhaps the sparrows will  beat against the window-panes! I wonder if I shall take root here, and  winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!\"    He knew very much about the matter! but he was so impatient that for  sheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same  thing as a headache with us.    The candles were now lighted. What brightness! What splendour! The  Tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the  foliage. It blazed up splendidly.    \"Help! Help!\" cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.    Now the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was  so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendour, that he was  quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both  folding-doors opened, and a troop of children rushed in as if they would  upset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones  stood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted so  that the whole place reechoed with their rejoicing; they danced round  the tree, and one present after the other was pulled off.    \"What are they about?\" thought the Tree. \"What is to happen now?\" And  the lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down  they were put out, one after the other, and then the children had  permission to plunder the tree. So they fell upon it with such violence  that all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the  cask, it would certainly have tumbled down.    The children danced about with their beautiful playthings: no one looked  at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but  it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been  forgotten.    \"A story! a story!\" cried the children, drawing a little fat man toward  the tree. He seated himself under it, and said: \"Now we are in the  shade, and the Tree can listen, too. But I shall tell only one story.  Now which will you have: that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about Klumpy-Dumpy  who tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married  the princess?\"    \"Ivedy-Avedy!\" cried some; \"Klumpy-Dumpy\" cried the others. There was  such a bawling and screaming--the Fir-tree alone was silent, and he  thought to himself, \"Am I not to bawl with the rest?--am I to do nothing  whatever?\" for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to  do.    And the man told about Klumpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who  notwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.  And the children clapped their hands, and cried out, \"Oh, go on! Do go  on!\" They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy, too, but the little man  only told them about Klumpy-Dumpy. The Fir-tree stood quite still and  absorbed in thought; the birds in the woods had never related the like  of this. \"Klumpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess!  Yes! Yes! that's the way of the world!\" thought the Fir-tree, and  believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good-looking.  \"Well, well! who knows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a  princess as wife!\" And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when  he hoped to be decked out again with lights, playthings, fruits, and  tinsel.    \"I won't tremble to-morrow,\" thought the Fir-tree. \"I will enjoy to  the full all my splendour. To-morrow I shall hear again the story of  Klumpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy, too.\" And the whole night  the Tree stood still and in deep thought.    In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.    \"Now, then, the splendour will begin again,\" thought the Fir. But they  dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft; and here  in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. \"What's  the meaning of this?\" thought the Tree. \"What am I to do here? What  shall I hear now, I wonder?\" And he leaned against the wall, lost in  reverie. Time enough had he, too, for his reflections; for days and  nights passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did  come, it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.  There stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely  forgotten.    \"'Tis now winter out of doors!\" thought the Tree. \"The earth is hard and  covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been  put up here under shelter till the springtime comes! How thoughtful that  is! How kind man is, after all! If it only were not so dark here, and  so terribly lonely! Not even a hare. And out in the woods it was so  pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hare leaped by;  yes--even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then. It is  really terribly lonely here!\"    \"Squeak! squeak!\" said a little Mouse at the same moment, peeping out  of his hole. And then another little one came. They sniffed about the  Fir-tree, and rustled among the branches.    \"It is dreadfully cold,\" said the Mouse. \"But for that, it would be  delightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?\"    \"I am by no means old,\" said the Fir-tree. \"There's many a one  considerably older than I am.\"    \"Where do you come from,\" asked the Mice; \"and what can you do?\" They  were so extremely curious. \"Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the  earth. Have you never been there? Were you never in the larder, where  cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where one dances  about on tallow-candles; that place where one enters lean, and comes out  again fat and portly?\"    \"I know no such place,\" said the Tree, \"but I know the woods, where the  sun shines, and where the little birds sing.\" And then he told all about  his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they  listened and said:    \"Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have  been!\"    \"I?\" said the Fir-tree, thinking over what he had himself related. \"Yes,  in reality those were happy times.\" And then he told about Christmas  Eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.    \"Oh,\" said the little Mice, \"how fortunate you have been, old Fir-tree!\"    \"I am by no means old,\" said he. \"I came from the woods this winter; I  am in my prime, and am only rather short for my age.\"    \"What delightful stories you know!\""]]]
