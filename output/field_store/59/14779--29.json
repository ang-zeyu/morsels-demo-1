Literary folk used to turn up now and then to interview  Andrew, but generally I managed to head them off.    But Andrew got to be less and less of a farmer and more and more  of a literary man. He bought a typewriter. He would hang over the  pigpen noting down adjectives for the sunset instead of mending the  weather vane on the barn which took a slew so that the north wind  came from the southwest. He hardly ever looked at the Sears Roebuck  catalogues any more, and after Mr. Decameron came to visit us and  suggested that Andrew write a book of country poems, the man became  simply unbearable.    And all the time I was counting eggs and turning out three meals a  day, and running the farm when Andrew got a literary fit and would  go off on some vagabond jaunt to collect adventures for a new book.  (I wish you could have seen the state he was in when he came back  from these trips, hoboing it along the roads without any money or a  clean sock to his back. One time he returned with a cough you could  hear the other side of the barn, and I had to nurse him for three  weeks.) When somebody wrote a little booklet about \"The Sage of  Redfield\" and described me as a \"rural Xantippe\" and \"the domestic  balance-wheel that kept the great writer close to the homely  realities of life\" I made up my mind to give Andrew some of his own  medicine. And that's my story.        CHAPTER TWO      It was a fine, crisp morning in fall--October I dare say--and I was  in the kitchen coring apples for apple sauce. We were going to have  roast pork for dinner with boiled potatoes and what Andrew calls  Vandyke brown gravy. Andrew had driven over to town to get some  flour and feed and wouldn't be back till noontime.    Being a Monday, Mrs. McNally, the washerwoman, had come over to take  care of the washing. I remember I was just on my way out to the wood  pile for a few sticks of birch when I heard wheels turn in at the  gate. There was one of the fattest white horses I ever saw, and a  queer wagon, shaped like a van. A funny-looking little man with a  red beard leaned forward from the seat and said something. I didn't  hear what it was, I was looking at that preposterous wagon of his.    It was coloured a pale, robin's-egg blue, and on the side, in big  scarlet letters, was painted:      R. MIFFLIN'S    TRAVELLING PARNASSUS    GOOD BOOKS FOR SALE    SHAKESPEARE, CHARLES LAMB, R.L.S.    HAZLITT, AND ALL OTHERS    Underneath the wagon, in slings, hung what looked like a tent,  together with a lantern, a bucket, and other small things. The van  had a raised skylight on the roof, something like an old-fashioned  trolley car; and from one corner went up a stove pipe. At the back  was a door with little windows on each side and a flight of steps  leading up to it.    As I stood looking at this queer turnout, the little reddish man  climbed down from in front and stood watching me. His face was a  comic mixture of pleasant drollery and a sort of weather-beaten  cynicism. He had a neat little russet beard and a shabby Norfolk  jacket. His head was very bald.    \"Is this where Andrew McGill lives?\" he said.    I admitted it.    \"But he's away until noon,\" I added. \"He'll be back then. There's  roast pork for dinner.\"    \"And apple sauce?\" said the little man.    \"Apple sauce and brown gravy,\" I said. \"That's why I'm sure he'll be  home on time. Sometimes he's late when there's boiled dinner, but  never on roast pork days. Andrew would never do for a rabbi.\"    A sudden suspicion struck me.    \"You're not another publisher, are you?\" I cried. \"What do you want  with Andrew?\"    \"I was wondering whether he wouldn't buy this outfit,\" said the  little man, including, with a wave of the hand, both van and white  horse. As he spoke he released a hook somewhere, and raised the  whole side of his wagon like a flap. Some kind of catch clicked, the  flap remained up like a roof, displaying nothing but books--rows and  rows of them. The flank of his van was nothing but a big bookcase.  Shelves stood above shelves, all of them full of books--both old and  new. As I stood gazing, he pulled out a printed card from somewhere  and gave it to me:      ROGER MIFFLIN'S    TRAVELLING PARNASSUS      Worthy friends, my wain doth hold    Many a book, both new and old;    Books, the truest friends of man,    Fill this rolling caravan.    Books to satisfy all uses,    Golden lyrics of the Muses,    Books on cookery and farming,    Novels passionate and charming,    Every kind for every need    So that he who buys may read.    What librarian can surpass us?      MIFFLIN'S TRAVELLING PARNASSUS      By R. Mifflin, Prop'r.      Star Job Print, Celeryville, Va.    While I was chuckling over this, he had raised a similar flap on the  other side of the Parnassus which revealed still more shelves loaded  with books.    I'm afraid I am severely practical by nature.    \"Well!\" I said, \"I should think you _would_ need a pretty stout  steed to lug that load along. It must weigh more than a coal wagon.\"    \"Oh, Peg can manage it all right,\" he said. \"We don't travel very  fast. But look here, I want to sell out. Do you suppose your husband  would buy the outfit--Parnassus, Pegasus, and all? He's fond of  books, isn't he?    \"Hold on a minute!\" I said. \"Andrew's my brother, not my husband,  and he's altogether _too_ fond of books. Books'll be the ruin of  this farm pretty soon. He's mooning about over his books like a  sitting hen about half the time, when he ought to be mending  harness. Lord, if he saw this wagonload of yours he'd be unsettled  for a week. I have to stop the postman down the road and take all  the publishers' catalogues out of the mail so that Andrew don't  see 'em. I'm mighty glad he's not here just now, I can tell you!\"    I'm not literary, as I said before, but I'm human enough to like  a good book, and my eye was running along those shelves of his  as I spoke. He certainly had a pretty miscellaneous collection.  I noticed poetry, essays, novels, cook books, juveniles, school  books, Bibles, and what not--all jumbled together.    \"Well, see here,\" said the little man--and about this time I noticed  that he had the bright eyes of a fanatic--\"I've been cruising with  this Parnassus going on seven years. I've covered the territory from  Florida to Maine and I reckon I've injected about as much good  literature into the countryside as ever old Doc Eliot did with his  five-foot shelf. I want to sell out now. I'm going to write a book  about 'Literature Among the Farmers,' and want to settle down with  my brother in Brooklyn and write it. I've got a sackful of notes for  it. I guess I'll just stick around until Mr. McGill gets home and  see if he won't buy me out. I'll sell the whole concern, horse,  wagon, and books, for $400. I've read Andrew McGill's stuff and I  reckon the proposition'll interest him. I've had more fun with this  Parnassus than a barrel of monkeys. I used to be a school teacher  till my health broke down. Then I took this up and I've made more  than expenses and had the time of my life.\"    \"Well, Mr. Mifflin,\" I said, \"if you want to stay around I guess I  can't stop you. But I'm sorry you and your old Parnassus ever came  this way.\"    I turned on my heel and went back to the kitchen. I knew pretty well  that Andrew would go up in the air when he saw that wagonload of  books and one of those crazy cards with Mr. Mifflin's poetry on it.    I must confess that I was considerably upset. Andrew is just as  unpractical and fanciful as a young girl, and always dreaming of  new adventures and rambles around the country. If he ever saw that  travelling Parnassus he'd fall for it like snap. And I knew Mr.  Decameron was after him for a new book anyway. (I'd intercepted one  of his letters suggesting another \"Happiness and Hayseed\" trip just  a few weeks before. Andrew was away when the letter came. I had a  suspicion what was in it; so I opened it, read it, and--well, burnt  it. Heavens! as though Andrew didn't have enough to do without  mooning down the road like a tinker, just to write a book about it.)    As I worked around the kitchen I could see Mr. Mifflin making  himself at home. He unhitched his horse, tied her up to the fence,  sat down by the wood pile, and lit a pipe. I could see I was in for  it. By and by I couldn't stand it any longer. I went out to talk to  that bald-headed pedlar.    \"See here,\" I said. \"You're a pretty cool fish to make yourself so  easy in my yard. I tell you I don't want you around here, you and  your travelling parcheesi. Suppose you clear out of here before my  brother gets back and don't be breaking up our happy family.\"    \"Miss McGill,\" he said (the man had a pleasant way with him,  too--darn him--with his bright, twinkling eye and his silly little  beard), \"I'm sure I don't want to be discourteous. If you move me on  from here, of course I'll go; but I warn you I shall lie in wait for  Mr. McGill just down this road. I'm here to sell this caravan of  culture, and by the bones of Swinburne I think your brother's the  man to buy it.\"    My blood was up now, and I'll admit that I said my next without  proper calculation.    \"Rather than have Andrew buy your old parcheesi,\" I said, \"I'll buy  it myself. I'll give you $300 for it.\"    The little man's face brightened. He didn't either accept or decline  my offer. (I was frightened to death that he'd take me right on the  nail and bang would go my three years' savings for a Ford.)    \"Come and have another look at her,\" he said.    I must admit that Mr. Roger Mifflin had fixed up his van mighty  comfortably inside. The body of the wagon was built out on each side  over the wheels, which gave it an unwieldy appearance but made extra  room for the bookshelves. This left an inside space about five feet  wide and nine long. On one side he had a little oil stove, a flap  table, and a cozy-looking bunk above which was built a kind of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5321"],[0,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (#2)"],[1,"charm of childhood, but they are mere  childish echoes of conventional prettiness. Her talent, when mature,  will turn to the charming rather than to the vigorous. There could be no  greater contrast between such drawing and that of--say--Cimabue.  Cimabue's Madonnas are not pretty women, but huge, solemn symbols. Their  heads droop stiffly; their tenderness is universal. In Gauguin's \"Agony  in the Garden\" the figure of Christ is haggard with pain and grief.  These artists have filled their pictures with a bitter experience which  no child can possibly possess. I repeat, therefore, that the analogy  between Post-Impressionism and child-art is a false analogy, and that  for a trained man or woman to paint as a child paints is an  impossibility. [Footnote: I am well aware that this statement is at  variance with Kandinsky, who has contributed a long article--\"Uber die  Formfrage\"--to Der Blaue Reiter, in which he argues the parallel between  Post-Impressionism and child vision, as exemplified in the work of Henri  Rousseau. Certainly Rousseau's vision is childlike. He has had no  artistic training and pretends to none. But I consider that his art  suffers so greatly from his lack of training, that beyond a sentimental  interest it has little to recommend it.]    All this does not presume to say that the \"symbolist\" school of  art is necessarily nobler than the \"naturalist.\" I am making no  comparison, only a distinction. When the difference in aim is  fully realized, the Primitives can no longer be condemned as  incompetent, nor the moderns as lunatics, for such a condemnation  is made from a wrong point of view. Judgement must be passed, not  on the failure to achieve \"naturalism\" but on the failure to  express the inner meaning.    The brief historical survey attempted above ended with the names of  Cezanne and Gauguin, and for the purposes of this Introduction, for the  purpose, that is to say, of tracing the genealogy of the Cubists and of  Kandinsky, these two names may be taken to represent the modern  expression of the \"symbolist\" tradition.    The difference between them is subtle but goes very deep. For  both the ultimate and internal significance of what they painted  counted for more than the significance which is momentary and  external. Cezanne saw in a tree, a heap of apples, a human face,  a group of bathing men or women, something more abiding than  either photography or impressionist painting could present. He  painted the \"treeness\" of the tree, as a modern critic has  admirably expressed it. But in everything he did he showed the  architectural mind of the true Frenchman. His landscape studies  were based on a profound sense of the structure of rocks and  hills, and being structural, his art depends essentially on  reality. Though he did not scruple, and rightly, to sacrifice  accuracy of form to the inner need, the material of which his art  was composed was drawn from the huge stores of actual nature.    Gauguin has greater solemnity and fire than Cezanne. His pictures  are tragic or passionate poems. He also sacrifices conventional  form to inner expression, but his art tends ever towards the  spiritual, towards that profounder emphasis which cannot be  expressed in natural objects nor in words. True his abandonment  of representative methods did not lead him to an abandonment of  natural terms of expression--that is to say human figures, trees  and animals do appear in his pictures. But that he was much  nearer a complete rejection of representation than was Cezanne is  shown by the course followed by their respective disciples.    The generation immediately subsequent to Cezanne, Herbin,  Vlaminck, Friesz, Marquet, etc., do little more than exaggerate  Cezanne's technique, until there appear the first signs of  Cubism. These are seen very clearly in Herbin. Objects begin to  be treated in flat planes. A round vase is represented by a  series of planes set one into the other, which at a distance  blend into a curve. This is the first stage.    The real plunge into Cubism was taken by Picasso, who, nurtured  on Cezanne, carried to its perfectly logical conclusion the  master's structural treatment of nature. Representation  disappears. Starting from a single natural object, Picasso and  the Cubists produce lines and project angles till their canvases  are covered with intricate and often very beautiful series of  balanced lines and curves. They persist, however, in giving them  picture titles which recall the natural object from which their  minds first took flight.    With Gauguin the case is different. The generation of his disciples  which followed him--I put it thus to distinguish them from his actual  pupils at Pont Aven, Serusier and the rest--carried the tendency  further. One hesitates to mention Derain, for his beginnings, full of  vitality and promise, have given place to a dreary compromise with  Cubism, without visible future, and above all without humour. But there  is no better example of the development of synthetic symbolism than his  first book of woodcuts.    [Footnote: L'Enchanteur pourrissant, par Guillaume Apollinaire,  avec illustrations gravees sur bois par Andre Derain. Paris,  Kahnweiler, 1910.]    Here is work which keeps the merest semblance of conventional  form, which gives its effect by startling masses of black and  white, by sudden curves, but more frequently by sudden angles.    [Footnote: The renaissance of the angle in art is an interesting  feature of the new movement. Not since Egyptian times has it been  used with such noble effect. There is a painting of Gauguin's at  Hagen, of a row of Tahitian women seated on a bench, that  consists entirely of a telling design in Egyptian angles. Cubism  is the result of this discovery of the angle, blended with the  influence of Cezanne.]    In the process of the gradual abandonment of natural form the  \"angle\" school is paralleled by the \"curve\" school, which also  descends wholly from Gauguin. The best known representative is  Maurice Denis. But he has become a slave to sentimentality, and  has been left behind. Matisse is the most prominent French artist  who has followed Gauguin with curves. In Germany a group of young  men, who form the Neue Kunstlevereinigung in Munich, work almost  entirely in sweeping curves, and have reduced natural objects  purely to flowing, decorative units.    But while they have followed Gauguin's lead in abandoning  representation both of these two groups of advance are lacking in  spiritual meaning. Their aim becomes more and more decorative,  with an undercurrent of suggestion of simplified form. Anyone who  has studied Gauguin will be aware of the intense spiritual value  of his work. The man is a preacher and a psychologist, universal  by his very unorthodoxy, fundamental because he goes deeper than  civilization. In his disciples this great element is wanting.  Kandinsky has supplied the need. He is not only on the track of  an art more purely spiritual than was conceived even by Gauguin,  but he has achieved the final abandonment of all representative  intention. In this way he combines in himself the spiritual and  technical tendencies of one great branch of Post-Impressionism.    The question most generally asked about Kandinsky's art is: \"What  is he trying to do?\" It is to be hoped that this book will do  something towards answering the question. But it will not do  everything. This--partly because it is impossible to put into  words the whole of Kandinsky's ideal, partly because in his  anxiety to state his case, to court criticism, the author has  been tempted to formulate more than is wise. His analysis of  colours and their effects on the spectator is not the real basis  of his art, because, if it were, one could, with the help of a  scientific manual, describe one's emotions before his pictures  with perfect accuracy. And this is impossible.    Kandinsky is painting music. That is to say, he has broken down  the barrier between music and painting, and has isolated the pure  emotion which, for want of a better name, we call the artistic  emotion. Anyone who has listened to good music with any enjoyment  will admit to an unmistakable but quite indefinable thrill. He  will not be able, with sincerity, to say that such a passage gave  him such visual impressions, or such a harmony roused in him such  emotions. The effect of music is too subtle for words. And the  same with this painting of Kandinsky's. Speaking for myself, to  stand in front of some of his drawings or pictures gives a keener  and more spiritual pleasure than any other kind of painting. But  I could not express in the least what gives the pleasure.  Presumably the lines and colours have the same effect as harmony  and rhythm in music have on the truly musical. That psychology  comes in no one can deny. Many people--perhaps at present the  very large majority of people--have their colour-music sense  dormant. It has never been exercised. In the same way many people  are unmusical--either wholly, by nature, or partly, for lack of  experience. Even when Kandinsky's idea is universally understood  there may be many who are not moved by his melody. For my part,  something within me answered to Kandinsky's art the first time I  met with it. There was no question of looking for representation;  a harmony had been set up, and that was enough.    Of course colour-music is no new idea. That is to say attempts have been  made to play compositions in colour, by flashes and harmonies.  [Footnote: Cf. \"Colour Music,\" by A. Wallace Rimington. Hutchinson. 6s.  net.] Also music has been interpreted in colour. But I do not know of  any previous attempt to paint, without any reference to music,  compositions which shall have on the spectator an effect wholly divorced  from representative association. Kandinsky refers to attempts to paint  in colour-counterpoint. But that is a different matter, in that it is  the"]]]
