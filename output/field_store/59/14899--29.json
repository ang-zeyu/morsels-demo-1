All these scholars were my referees on  all points of difficulty. Pundit Ram Nath's solid scholarship is known to  them that have come in contact with him. I never referred to him a  difficulty that he could not clear up. Unfortunately, he was not always at  hand to consult. Pundit Shyama Charan Kaviratna, during my residence at  Seebpore, assisted me in going over the Mokshadharma sections of the Santi  Parva. Unostentatious in the extreme, Kaviratna is truly the type of a  learned Brahman of ancient India. Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee also has from  time to time, rendered me valuable assistance in clearing my difficulties.    Gigantic as the work is, it would have been exceedingly difficult for me  to go on with it if I had not been encouraged by Sir Stuart Bayley, Sir  Auckland Colvin, Sir Alfred Croft, and among Oriental scholars, by the  late lamented Dr. Reinhold Rost, and Mons. A. Barth of Paris. All these  eminent men knew from the beginning that the translation was proceeding  from my pen. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm, with which my poor friend,  Pratapa Chandra Roy, always endeavoured to fill me. I am sure my energies  would have flagged and patience exhausted but for the encouraging words  which I always received from these patrons and friends of the enterprise.    Lastly, I should name my literary chief and friend, Dr. Sambhu C.  Mookherjee. The kind interest he took in my labours, the repeated  exhortations he addressed to me inculcating patience, the care with which  he read every fasciculus as it came out, marking all those passages which  threw light upon topics of antiquarian interest, and the words of praise  he uttered when any expression particularly happy met his eyes, served to  stimulate me more than anything else in going on with a task that  sometimes seemed to me endless.    Kisari Mohan Ganguli    Calcutta      THE MAHABHARATA    ADI PARVA    SECTION I    Om! Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted male being,  and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.    Ugrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well-versed in the  Puranas, bending with humility, one day approached the great sages of  rigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years'  sacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, in the forest of Naimisha. Those  ascetics, wishing to hear his wonderful narrations, presently began to  address him who had thus arrived at that recluse abode of the inhabitants  of the forest of Naimisha. Having been entertained with due respect by  those holy men, he saluted those Munis (sages) with joined palms, even all  of them, and inquired about the progress of their asceticism. Then all the  ascetics being again seated, the son of Lomaharshana humbly occupied the  seat that was assigned to him. Seeing that he was comfortably seated, and  recovered from fatigue, one of the Rishis beginning the conversation,  asked him, \"Whence comest thou, O lotus-eyed Sauti, and where hast thou  spent the time? Tell me, who ask thee, in detail.\"    Accomplished in speech, Sauti, thus questioned, gave in the midst of that  big assemblage of contemplative Munis a full and proper answer in words  consonant with their mode of life.    Sauti said, \"Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which  were composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-Dwaipayana, and which were  recited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled  royal sage Janamejaya and in the presence also of that chief of Princes,  the son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred  waters and holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the  Dwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly was fought  the battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of  the land ranged on either side. Thence, anxious to see you, I am come into  your presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma; ye  greatly blessed who shine in this place of sacrifice with the splendour of  the solar fire: ye who have concluded the silent meditations and have fed  the holy fire; and yet who are sitting--without care, what, O ye Dwijas  (twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred stories collected  in the Puranas containing precepts of religious duty and of worldly profit,  or the acts of illustrious saints and sovereigns of mankind?\"    The Rishi replied, \"The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi  Dwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by the gods and the  Brahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that  exists, diversified both in diction and division, possessing subtile  meanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred work.  Composed in elegant language, it includeth the subjects of other books. It  is elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of the four  Vedas. We are desirous of hearing that history also called Bharata, the  holy composition of the wonderful Vyasa, which dispelleth the fear of evil,  just as it was cheerfully recited by the Rishi Vaisampayana, under the  direction of Dwaipayana himself, at the snake-sacrifice of Raja  Janamejaya.\"    Sauti then said, \"Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to  whom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by the multitude; who is  the true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible, eternal;  who is both a non-existing and an existing-non-existing being; who is the  universe and also distinct from the existing and non-existing universe;  who is the creator of high and low; the ancient, exalted, inexhaustible  one; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself, worthy of all  preference, pure and immaculate; who is Hari, the ruler of the faculties,  the guide of all things moveable and immoveable; I will declare the sacred  thoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvellous deeds and worshipped  here by all. Some bards have already published this history, some are now  teaching it, and others, in like manner, will hereafter promulgate it upon  the earth. It is a great source of knowledge, established throughout the  three regions of the world. It is possessed by the twice-born both in  detailed and compendious forms. It is the delight of the learned for being  embellished with elegant expressions, conversations human and divine, and  a variety of poetical measures.    \"In this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and  enveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as the  primal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all  created beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was formed at the beginning of  the Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal one,  the wonderful and inconceivable being present alike in all places; the  invisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and non-  entity. From this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only  Prajapati; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the twenty-one  Prajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Parameshthi; ten Prachetas, Daksha,  and the seven sons of Daksha. Then appeared the man of inconceivable  nature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the  Vasus, and the twin Aswins; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the  Guhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and most holy  Brahmarshis, and the numerous Rajarshis distinguished by every noble  quality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, the air, the sky, the  points of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the fortnights,  called Pakshas, with day and night in due succession. And thus were  produced all things which are known to mankind.    \"And what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of created  things, will at the end of the world, and after the expiration of the Yuga,  be again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas, all things  will be renovated, and, like the various fruits of the earth, succeed each  other in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth perpetually to  revolve in the world, without beginning and without end, this wheel which  causeth the destruction of all things.    \"The generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand, thirty-three  hundred and thirty-three. The sons of Div were Brihadbhanu, Chakshus, Atma,  Vibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and Ravi. Of these  Vivaswans of old, Mahya was the youngest whose son was Deva-vrata. The  latter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three sons,--Dasa-  jyoti, Sata-jyoti, and Sahasra-jyoti, each of them producing numerous  offspring. The illustrious Dasa-jyoti had ten thousand, Sata-jyoti ten  times that number, and Sahasra-jyoti ten times the number of Sata-jyoti's  offspring. From these are descended the family of the Kurus, of the Yadus,  and of Bharata; the family of Yayati and of Ikshwaku; also of all the  Rajarshis. Numerous also were the generations produced, and very abundant  were the creatures and their places of abode. The mystery which is  threefold--the Vedas, Yoga, and Vijnana Dharma, Artha, and Kama--also  various books upon the subject of Dharma, Artha, and Kama; also rules for  the conduct of mankind; also histories and discourses with various srutis;  all of which having been seen by the Rishi Vyasa are here in due order  mentioned as a specimen of the book.    \"The Rishi Vyasa published this mass of knowledge in both a detailed and an  abridged form. It is the wish of the learned in the world to possess the  details and the abridgement.

An army of horrid men had come, when she was asleep, and built a  dam. They had fenced round the swamp and were actually beginning to dig  sluices to drain the land. Some were at work, building a windmill to  help in pumping out the water.    The first thing she knew she had bumped her pretty nose against the dam.  She thought at once of escaping over the logs and into the sea. When she  tried to clamber over the top and get through the fence, her hair got so  entangled between the bars that she had to throw away her comb and  mirror and try to untangle her tresses. The more she tried, the worse  became the tangle. Soon her long hair was all twisted up in the timber.  In vain were her struggles to escape. She was ready to die with fright,  when she saw four horrid men rush up to seize her. She attempted to  waddle away, but her long hair held her to the post and rails. Her  modesty was so dreadfully shocked that she fainted away.    When she came to herself, she found she was in a big long tub. A crowd  of curious little girls and boys were looking at her, for she was on  show as a great curiosity. They were bound to see her and get their  money's worth in looking, for they had paid a stiver (two cents)  admission to the show. Again, before all these eyes, her modesty was so  shocked that she gave one groan, flopped over and died in the tub.    Woe to the poor father and mother at Urk! They came back to find their  old home gone. Unable to get into it, they swam out to sea, never  stopping till they reached Spitzbergen.    What became of the body of the Mermaid Queen?    Learned men came from Leyden to examine what was now only a specimen,  and to see how mermaids were made up. Then her skin was stuffed, and  glass eyes put in, where her shining orbs had been. After this, her body  was stuffed and mounted in the museum, that is, set up above a glass  case and resting upon iron rods. Artists came to Leyden to make pictures  of her and no fewer than nine noblemen copied her pretty form and  features into their coats of arms. Instead of the Mermaid's Pool is now  a cheese farm of fifty cows, a fine house and barn, and a family of  pink-cheeked, yellow-haired children who walk and play in wooden shoes.    So this particular mermaid, all because of her entanglement in the  fence, was more famous when stuffed than when living, while all her  young friends and older relatives were forgotten.          THE BOY WHO WANTED MORE CHEESE      Klaas Van Bommel was a Dutch boy, twelve years old, who lived where cows  were plentiful. He was over five feet high, weighed a hundred pounds,  and had rosy cheeks. His appetite was always good and his mother  declared his stomach had no bottom. His hair was of a color half-way  between a carrot and a sweet potato. It was as thick as reeds in a swamp  and was cut level, from under one ear to another.    Klaas stood in a pair of timber shoes, that made an awful rattle when he  ran fast to catch a rabbit, or scuffed slowly along to school over the  brick road of his village. In summer Klaas was dressed in a rough, blue  linen blouse. In winter he wore woollen breeches as wide as coffee bags.  They were called bell trousers, and in shape were like a couple of  cow-bells turned upwards. These were buttoned on to a thick warm jacket.  Until he was five years old, Klaas was dressed like his sisters. Then,  on his birthday, he had boy's clothes, with two pockets in them, of  which he was proud enough.    Klaas was a farmer's boy. He had rye bread and fresh milk for breakfast.  At dinner time, beside cheese and bread, he was given a plate heaped  with boiled potatoes. Into these he first plunged a fork and then dipped  each round, white ball into a bowl of hot melted butter. Very quickly  then did potato and butter disappear \"down the red lane.\" At supper, he  had bread and skim milk, left after the cream had been taken off, with a  saucer, to make butter. Twice a week the children enjoyed a bowl of  bonnyclabber or curds, with a little brown sugar sprinkled on the top.  But at every meal there was cheese, usually in thin slices, which the  boy thought not thick enough. When Klaas went to bed he usually fell  asleep as soon as his shock of yellow hair touched the pillow. In summer  time he slept till the birds began to sing, at dawn. In winter, when the  bed felt warm and Jack Frost was lively, he often heard the cows  talking, in their way, before he jumped out of his bag of straw, which  served for a mattress. The Van Bommels were not rich, but everything was  shining clean.    There was always plenty to eat at the Van Bommels' house. Stacks of rye  bread, a yard long and thicker than a man's arm, stood on end in the  corner of the cool, stone-lined basement. The loaves of dough were put  in the oven once a week. Baking time was a great event at the Van  Bommels' and no men-folks were allowed in the kitchen on that day,  unless they were called in to help. As for the milk-pails and pans,  filled or emptied, scrubbed or set in the sun every day to dry, and the  cheeses, piled up in the pantry, they seemed sometimes enough to feed a  small army.    But Klaas always wanted more cheese. In other ways, he was a good boy,  obedient at home, always ready to work on the cow-farm, and diligent in  school. But at the table he never had enough. Sometimes his father  laughed and asked him if he had a well, or a cave, under his jacket.    Klaas had three younger sisters, Trintjé, Anneké and Saartjé; which is  Dutch for Kate, Annie and Sallie. These, their fond mother, who loved  them dearly, called her \"orange blossoms\"; but when at dinner, Klaas  would keep on, dipping his potatoes into the hot butter, while others  were all through, his mother would laugh and call him her Buttercup. But  always Klaas wanted more cheese. When unusually greedy, she twitted him  as a boy \"worse than Butter-and-Eggs\"; that is, as troublesome as the  yellow and white plant, called toad-flax, is to the farmer--very  pretty, but nothing but a weed.    One summer's evening, after a good scolding, which he deserved well,  Klaas moped and, almost crying, went to bed in bad humor. He had teased  each one of his sisters to give him her bit of cheese, and this, added  to his own slice, made his stomach feel as heavy as lead.    Klaas's bed was up in the garret. When the house was first built, one of  the red tiles of the roof had been taken out and another one, made of  glass, was put in its place. In the morning, this gave the boy light to  put on his clothes. At night, in fair weather, it supplied air to his  room.    A gentle breeze was blowing from the pine woods on the sandy slope, not  far away. So Klaas climbed up on the stool to sniff the sweet piny  odors. He thought he saw lights dancing under the tree. One beam seemed  to approach his roof hole, and coming nearer played round the chimney.  Then it passed to and fro in front of him. It seemed to whisper in his  ear, as it moved by. It looked very much as if a hundred fire-flies had  united their cold light into one lamp. Then Klaas thought that the  strange beams bore the shape of a lovely girl, but he only laughed at  himself at the idea. Pretty soon, however, he thought the whisper became  a voice. Again, he laughed so heartily, that he forgot his moping and  the scolding his mother had given him. In fact, his eyes twinkled with  delight, when the voice gave this invitation:    \"There's plenty of cheese. Come with us.\"    To make sure of it, the sleepy boy now rubbed his eyes and cocked his  ears. Again, the light-bearer spoke to him: \"Come.\"    Could it be? He had heard old people tell of the ladies of the wood,  that whispered and warned travellers. In fact, he himself had often seen  the \"fairies' ring\" in the pine woods. To this, the flame-lady was  inviting him.    Again and again the moving, cold light circled round the red tile roof,  which the moon, then rising and peeping over the chimneys, seemed to  turn into silver plates. As the disc rose higher in the sky, he could  hardly see the moving light, that had looked like a lady; but the voice,  no longer a whisper, as at first, was now even plainer:    \"There's plenty of cheese. Come with us.\"    \"I'll see what it is, anyhow,\" said Klaas, as he drew on his thick  woolen stockings and prepared to go down-stairs and out, without waking  a soul. At the door he stepped into his wooden shoes. Just then the cat  purred and rubbed up against his shins. He jumped, for he was scared;  but looking down, for a moment, he saw the two balls of yellow fire in  her head and knew what they were. Then he sped to the pine woods and  towards the fairy ring.    What an odd sight! At first Klaas thought it was a circle of big  fire-flies. Then he saw clearly that there were dozens of pretty  creatures, hardly as large as dolls, but as lively as crickets. They  were as full of light, as if lamps had wings. Hand in hand, they flitted  and danced around the ring of grass, as if this was fun.    Hardly had Klaas got over his first surprise, than of a sudden he felt  himself surrounded by the fairies. Some of the strongest among them had  left the main party in the circle and come to him. He felt himself  pulled by their dainty fingers. One of them, the loveliest of all,  whispered in his ear:    \"Come, you must dance with us.\"    Then a dozen of the pretty creatures murmured in chorus:    \"Plenty of cheese here. Plenty of cheese here. Come, come!\"    Upon this, the heels of Klaas seemed as light as a feather. In a moment,  with both hands clasped in those of the fairies, he was dancing in high  glee. It was as much fun as if he were at the kermiss, with a row of  boys and girls, hand in hand, swinging along the streets, as Dutch maids  and youth do, during kermiss week.    Klaas had not time to look hard at the fairies, for he was too full of  the fun. He danced and danced, all night"]]]
