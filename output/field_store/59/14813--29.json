[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends â€” Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#2)"],[1," of Sevres, beloved with a tenderness which would  have warped the disposition of one less unselfish; emotionally  intense, brilliancy and vivacity periodically burst through the habit  of her reserve. A perfect pupil, and in all fine things literary,  keenly alive, she had written several short sketches which showed  imaginative originality and a sympathetic sensitiveness, especially  toward human suffering. And her uncle was sure that a greater than  George Eliot had come. There was to be a year abroad, and as the  doctor and her teacher in English agreed on Italy, there she went. At  seventeen, during the year in Florence, the inevitable lover came.  Family traditions, parents, her orphanage, the protective surroundings  of her uncle's home, her instincts--all had kept her apart. Her  knowledge of young lovers was but literary, and this particular young  lover presented a side which soon laid deep hold on her confidence.  They studied Italian together. He was musical, she was poetic, and he  gracefully fitted her sonnets to melodies. Finally, it seemed that the  great Song of Life had brought them together to complete one of its  harmonies. Her confidence grew to love, the love which seemed to stand  to her for life. Then the awful suddenness, which had in the past  marked her sorrows, burst in again. In one heart-breaking, repelling  half-hour his other self was revealed, and a damaged love was left to  minister to wretchedness. Here was a hurt denied even the expression  of mourning stationery or black apparel--a hurt which must be hidden  and ever crowded back into the bursting within. Immediate catastrophe  would probably have followed had not, first, the fine pride of her  fine self, then the demands of her art for expression, stepped in to  save. She would write. She now knew human nature. She had tasted  bitterness; and with renewed seriousness she became a severely hard-  working student. But the wealth of her joy-life slipped away; the  morbid made itself apparent in every chapter she wrote, while  intensity became more and more the key-note of thought and effort.    Back at her uncle's home, the uncle who was now even more convinced  that Ethel had never outlived the shock of the loss of her parents,  she found that honest study and devotion to her self-imposed tasks,  and a life of much physical comfort and rarely artistic surroundings,  were all failing to make living worth while. In fact, things were  getting into a tangle. She was becoming noticeably restless. Repose  was so lost that it was only with increasing effort that she could  avoid attracting the attention of those near. Even in church it would  seem that some demon of unrest would never be appeased and only could  be satisfied by constant changing of position. Thoughts of father and  mother, and the affair in Florence, intensified this spirit of unrest,  and few conscious minutes passed that unseen stray locks were not  being replaced. It seemed to be a relief to take off and put on, time  and again, the ring which had been her mother's. Even her feet seemed  to rebel at the confinement of shoes, and she became obsessed with the  impulse to remove them, even in the theater or at the concert. A  sighing habit developed. It had been growing for years into an air-  hunger, and finally all physical, and much of mental, effort developed  a sense of suffocation which demanded short periods of absolute rest.  Associations were then formed between certain foods and disturbing  digestive sensations. Tea alone seemed to help, and she became  dependent upon increasingly numerous cups of this beverage. Knowing  her history as we do, we can easily see how she had become abnormally  acute in her responses to the discomforts which are always associated  with painful emotions, and that emotional distress was interpreted, or  misinterpreted, as physical disorder. Each year she became more truly  a sensitive-plant, suffering and keenly alive to every discomfort,  more and more easily fatigued by the conflicts between emotions, which  craved expression, and the will, which demanded repression.    Since the days in Florence there had been a growing antagonism to men,  certainly to all who indicated any suitor-like attitude. In her heart  she was forsworn. She had loved deeply once. Her idealism said it  could never come again. But her antagonism, and her idealism, and her  strength of will all failed to satisfy an inarticulate something which  locked her in her room for hours of repressed, unexplained sobbing.  Her writing became exhausting. Talks before her literary class were a  nightmare of anticipation--for through all, there had never been any  weakening of the beauty and intensity of her unselfish desire to give  to the world her best. The dear old uncle watched her with growing  apprehension. He persuaded her to seek health. It was first a water-  cure; then a minor, but ineffective operation; then much scientific  massage; and finally a rest-cure, and at the end no relief that  lasted, but a recurrence of symptoms which, to the uncle, spoke  ominously of a threatened mental balance. What truly was wrong? Do we  not see that this woman's nerves were crying out for help; that, as  her wisest friends, they were appealing for right ways of living; that  they were pleading for development of the body that had been only  half-trained; that they were beseeching a replacing of morbidness of  feeling by those lost joyous happiness-days? Were they not fairly  cursing the wrong which had robbed her of the hope and rights of her  womanhood?    A new life came when she was twenty-eight, with the saving helper who  heard the cry of the suffering nerves, and interpreted their message.  She had told him all. His wise kindness made it easy to tell all. He  showed her the wrong invalidism thoughts, the unhappy, depressing,  devitalizing attitude toward death. He revealed truths unthought by  her of manhood and womanhood. He pointed out the poisonous trail of  her enmity, and she put it from her. He inspired her to make friends  with her nerves, who were so devotedly striving to save her. Simple,  definite counsel he gave, for her body's sake. Her physical  development could never be what early constructive care would have  made it, but from out of her frailty grew, in less than a year of  active building-training, a reserve of strength unknown for  generations in the women of her line. Wholesome advice made her see  the undermining influence of her morbid, mental habits, and resolutely  she displaced them with the productive kind that builds character.  Finally, new wisdom and a truly womanly conception of her duty and  privilege replaced her antagonism to men, as understanding had  obliterated enmity. It would seem as though Providence had been only  waiting these changes, for they had hardly become certainties in her  life when the real lover came--a man in every way worthy her fineness  of instinct; one who could understand her literary ambitions and even  helpfully criticize her work; one who brought wholesome habits of life  and thought, and who could return cheer for cheer, and whose love  responded in kind to that which now so wonderfully welled up within  her.    Her new adjustments were to be deeply tried and their solidity and  worthiness tested to their center. Little Margaret came to make their  rare home perfect, and like a choice flower, she thrived in the glow  of its sunshine. At eighteen months, she was an ideal of babyhood.  Then the infection from an unknown source, the treacherous scarlatina,  the days of fierce, losing conflict, and sudden Death again smote  Ethel Lord. But she now knew and understood. There was deep sadness of  loss; there was greater joy in having had. There was an emptiness  where the little life had called forth loving attention; there was a  fulness of perfect mother-love which could never be taken. There were  no funeral days, no mourning black, no gruesome burial. There were  flowers, more tender love, and a beautified sorrow. Death was never  again to stand to Ethel Lord as irreparable loss, for a great faith  had made such loss impossible.    And such is the life of this woman, filled with the spirit of beauty  of soul--a woman who thrills husband and son with the uplift of her  unremitting joy in living, who inspires uncle and friends as one who  has mastered the art of a happy life, who holds the devotion of  neighbors and servants through her unselfish radiation of cheer. Ethel  Lord has learned truly the infinitely rich possibilities of our nerves  when we make them our friends.          CHAPTER II    THE NEUROTIC      For four heart-breaking years, the strife of a nation at war with  itself had spread desolation and sorrow broadcast. The fighting ceased  in April. One mid-June day following, the town folk and those from  countrysides far and near met on the ample grounds of a bride-to-be.  Had it not been for the sprinkling of blue uniforms, no thought of war  could have seemed possible that fair day. The bride's home had been  a-bustle with weeks of preparation for this hour, and nature was  rejoicing and the heavens smiling upon the occasion. Sam Clayton, the  bridegroom, was certainly a \"lucky dog.\" A quiet, unobtrusive son of a  neighboring farmer, he and Elizabeth had been school-children  together. Probably the war had lessened her opportunity for choice but  the night before he left for the front, they were engaged--and her  family was the best and wealthiest of the county. \"Lucky dog\" and \"war  romance,\" the men said. Nevertheless, six weeks ago he had returned  with his chevrons well-earned, and fifty years of square living later  proved his unquestioned worth. Elizabeth at twenty, on her bridal day,  was slender, lithe, fair-skinned; of Scotch-Irish descent, her gray  eyes bespoke her efficiency--to-day, they spoke her pride, though  neither to-day nor in years to come were they often softened by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#2)"],[1,"his empire into  three kingdoms. And now Bancroft, who is quoting Juarrors:        Retaining for himself the first, he gave the second to his oldest      son, Jiutemal, and the third to his second son, Acxiquat; and this      division was made on a day when three suns were seen, which has      caused some to think that it took place on the day of the birth of      our Redeemer, a day on which it is commonly believed that such a      meteor was observed. [3]    The \"day when three suns were seen\"--\"the day of the birth of our  Redeemer\"--easily accords with the two days and a night of the  continuous light of the Book of Mormon, especially when considered in  connection with the appearance of a \"new star\" (the \"meteor\" of the  quotation) as a sign to the Nephites of the birth of Messiah.    Referring to the traditions of the primitive Nahua period, after  dealing with the events of the first age, which treats of the creation,  flood, dispersion of mankind, the migration of a colony of seven  families to a new land, etc., Bancroft, following the native writer  Ixtilxochiti, deals with the second Nahua age, as follows:        The second age, the \"sun and air,\" terminated with a great      hurricane which swept away trees, rocks, houses and people,      although many men and women escaped, chiefly such as took refuge      in caves which the hurricane could not reach. After several days      the survivors came out to find a multitude of apes living in the      land; and all this time they were in darkness, seeing neither the      sun nor the moon. The next event recorded, although Veytia makes it      precede the hurricane, is the stopping of the sun for a whole day      in his course, as at the command of Joshua as recorded in the Old      Testament, [4]    Let no one confound these cataclysms attended with darkness to the  flood period of the first Nahua age--which is identical with Noah's  flood; they relate to disasters subsequent to that period; they  correspond in time and character to the disasters described in the Book  of Mormon as taking place in the western hemisphere during the time of  the crucifixion and interment of Messiah in Judea. This, I believe,  will be established as reasonably clear as we proceed.    Concerning the foregoing passage, I also call attention to the fact  that Veytia is said to place before the tempest and the darkness of  the tradition the stopping of the sun for a whole day in his course,  as at the command of Joshua. Instead of having reference to the Joshua  incident, however, may not the incident of the American tradition have  reference to the Book of Mormon sign of Messiah's birth, these two days  and a night through which there was continuous light? [5] The apparent  \"stopping of the sun a whole day in his course\" would certainly give  the period of uninterrupted light required by the Book of Mormon sign  of Messiah's birth; and the fact that so noted an authority as Veytia   [6] places that singular event before the fierce tempest attended by  darkness, restores the order of the events required by the Book of  Mormon account of those matters.    De Roo, quoting Bastian, [7] says:        Another circumstance of the Savior's death seems to be remembered      in Mexico, for it is related in its traditions that, at the      disappearance of Topiltzin or Quetzalcohuatl, [a native culture      hero most nearly resembling, as we shall see, the appearance and      character of Messiah in the western world], both sun and moon were      covered in darkness, while a single star appeared in the heavens.      [8]    Here, clear enough, is allusion to the darkness that covered the land  at Messiah's death; may not the star, which here appears out of order,  according to Book of Mormon statements, really have been the one which  appeared to the Nephites as the sign of Messiah's birth?    II.    _The Signs of Messiah's Death._    The signs which were to be given to the inhabitants of the western  hemisphere of Messiah's death were foretold by a Lamanite prophet as  follows:        Behold, in that day that he shall suffer death, the sun shall be      darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon,      and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this      land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space      of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead;      yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost, there shall be      thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the      earth shall shake and tremble, and the rocks which are upon the      face of this earth; which are both above the earth and beneath,      which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is      one solid mass, shall be broken up; yea, they shall be rent in      twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in      broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth; yea, both above      the earth and beneath. And behold, there shall be great tempests,      and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley,      and there shall be many places which are now called valleys, which      shall become mountains, whose height is great. And many highways      shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate, and many      graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead;      and many saints shall appear unto many. And behold thus hath the      angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me, that there should be      thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours; and he      said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted and      the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should      cover the face of the whole earth [9] for the space of three days.      [10]    This prediction was literally and awfully fulfilled. Mormon's condensed  account of it being as follows:        And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first      month, in the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm,      such an one as never had been known in all the land; and there was      also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder,      insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to      divide asunder; and there were exceeding sharp lightnings, such as      never had been known in all the land. And the city of Zarahemla      did take fire; and the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of      the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned; and the earth      was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of      the city there became a great mountain; and there was a great and      terrible destruction in the land southward. But behold, there      was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward;      for behold, the whole face of the land was changed, because of      the tempest, and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings, and the      lightnings, and the exceeding great quaking of the whole earth;      and the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled,      and many smooth places became rough, and many great and notable      cities were sunk, and many were burned, and many were shaken till      the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants      thereof were slain; and the places were left desolate; and there      were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was      exceeding great, and there were many in them who were slain; and      there was some who were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither      they went, no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried      away; and thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because      of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the      quaking of the earth. And behold, the rocks were rent in twain;      they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch,      that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams, and in      cracks, upon all the face of the land. And it came to pass that      when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the      tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease--for behold, they      did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by      some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and      terrible things were done in about the space of three hours; and      then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land. And it      came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the      land, insomuch, that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen,      could feel the vapour of darkness; and there could be no light      because of the darkness; neither candles, neither torches; neither      could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood,      so that there could not be any light at all; and there was not any      light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the      moon, nor the stars, so great were the mists of darkness which were      upon the face of the land. And it came to pass that it did last for      the space of three days, that there was no light seen; and there      was great mourning, and howling, and weeping among all the people      continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because      of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.      [11]    From the Book of Mormon we learn that it was in the morning that these  terrible cataclysms began, and then were followed by the three days of  darkness: for in giving an account of the passing away of this terrible  calamity, Mormon says: \"Thus did the the three days pass away. And it  was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from all the face of the  earth and the earth did cease to tremble.\" [12] On this matter of the  signs of Messiah's crucifixion taking place \"in the morning,\" according  to "]]]
