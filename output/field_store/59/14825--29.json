What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards me? asks  the most devout Psalmist, an invincible King and first among the  prophets; in which most grateful question he approves himself a willing  thank-offerer, a multifarious debtor, and one who wishes for a holier  counsellor than himself: agreeing with Aristotle, the chief of  philosophers, who shows (in the 3rd and 6th books of his Ethics) that  all action depends upon counsel.    And indeed if so wonderful a prophet, having a fore-knowledge of divine  secrets, wished so anxiously to consider how he might gratefully repay  the blessings graciously bestowed, what can we fitly do, who are but  rude thanksgivers and most greedy receivers, laden with infinite divine  benefits?  Assuredly we ought with anxious deliberation and abundant  consideration, having first invoked the Sevenfold Spirit, that it may  burn in our musings as an illuminating fire, fervently to prepare a way  without hinderance, that the bestower of all things may be cheerfully  worshipped in return for the gifts that He has bestowed, that our  neighbour may be relieved of his burden, and that the guilt contracted  by sinners every day may be redeemed by the atonement of almsgiving.    Forewarned therefore through the admonition of the Psalmist's devotion  by Him who alone prevents and perfects the goodwill of man, without  Whom we have no power even so much as to think, and Whose gift we doubt  not it is, if we have done anything good, we have diligently inquired  and considered in our own heart as well as with others, what among the  good offices of various works of piety would most please the Almighty,  and would be more beneficial to the Church Militant.  And lo! there  soon occurred to our contemplation a host of unhappy, nay, rather of  elect scholars, in whom God the Creator and Nature His handmaid planted  the roots of excellent morals and of famous sciences, but whom the  poverty of their circumstances so oppressed that before the frown of  adverse fortune the seeds of excellence, so fruitful in the cultivated  field of youth, not being watered by the rain that they require, are  forced to wither away. Thus it happens that \"bright virtue lurks buried  in obscurity,\" to use the words of Boethius, and burning lights are not  put under a bushel, but for want of oil are utterly extinguished.  Thus  the field, so full of flower in Spring, has withered up before harvest  time; thus wheat degenerates to tares, and vines into the wild vines,  and thus olives run into the wild olive; the tender stems rot away  altogether, and those who might have grown up into strong pillars of  the Church, being endowed with the capacity of a subtle intellect,  abandon the schools of learning.  With poverty only as their  stepmother, they are repelled violently from the nectared cup of  philosophy as soon as they have tasted of it and have become more  fiercely thirsty by the very taste.  Though fit for the liberal arts  and disposed to study the sacred writings alone, being deprived of the  aid of their friends, by a kind of apostasy they return to the  mechanical arts solely to gain a livelihood, to the loss of the Church  and the degradation of the whole clergy.  Thus Mother Church conceiving  sons is compelled to miscarry, nay, some misshapen monster is born  untimely from her womb, and for lack of that little with which Nature  is contented, she loses excellent pupils, who might afterwards become  champions and athletes of the faith.  Alas, how suddenly the woof is  cut, while the hand of the weaver is beginning his work! Alas, how the  sun is eclipsed in the brightness of the dawn, and the planet in its  course is hurled backwards, and, while it bears the nature and likeness  of a star suddenly drops and becomes a meteor! What more piteous sight  can the pious man behold? What can more sharply stir the bowels of his  pity? What can more easily melt a heart hard as an anvil into hot  tears? On the other hand, let us recall from past experience how much  it has profited the whole Christian commonwealth, not indeed to  enervate students with the delights of a Sardanapalus or the riches of  a Croesus, but rather to support them in their poverty with the frugal  means that become the scholar.  How many have we seen with our eyes,  how many have we read of in books, who, distinguished by no pride of  birth, and rejoicing in no rich inheritance, but supported only by the  piety of the good, have made their way to apostolic chairs, have most  worthily presided over faithful subjects, have bent the necks of the  proud and lofty to the ecclesiastical yoke and have extended further  the liberties of the Church!    Accordingly, having taken a survey of human necessities in every  direction, with a view to bestow our charity upon them, our  compassionate inclinations have chosen to bear pious aid to this  calamitous class of men, in whom there is nevertheless such hope of  advantage to the Church, and to provide for them, not only in respect  of things necessary to their support, but much more in respect of the  books so useful to their studies.  To this end, most acceptable in the  sight of God, our attention has long been unweariedly devoted.  This  ecstatic love has carried us away so powerfully, that we have resigned  all thoughts of other earthly things, and have given ourselves up to a  passion for acquiring books.  That our intent and purpose, therefore,  may be known to posterity as well as to our contemporaries, and that we  may for ever stop the perverse tongues of gossipers as far as we are  concerned, we have published a little treatise written in the lightest  style of the moderns; for it is ridiculous to find a slight matter  treated of in a pompous style.  And this treatise (divided into twenty  chapters) will clear the love we have had for books from the charge of  excess, will expound the purpose of our intense devotion, and will  narrate more clearly than light all the circumstances of our  undertaking.  And because it principally treats of the love of books,  we have chosen, after the fashion of the ancient Romans, fondly to name  it by a Greek word, Philobiblon.        CHAPTER I    THAT THE TREASURE OF WISDOM IS CHIEFLY CONTAINED IN BOOKS    The desirable treasure of wisdom and science, which all men desire by  an instinct of nature, infinitely surpasses all the riches of the  world; in respect of which precious stones are worthless; in comparison  with which silver is as clay and pure gold is as a little sand; at  whose splendour the sun and moon are dark to look upon; compared with  whose marvellous sweetness honey and manna are bitter to the taste.  O  value of wisdom that fadeth not away with time, virtue ever  flourishing, that cleanseth its possessor from all venom!  O heavenly  gift of the divine bounty, descending from the Father of lights, that  thou mayest exalt the rational soul to the very heavens!  Thou art the  celestial nourishment of the intellect, which those who eat shall still  hunger and those who drink shall still thirst, and the gladdening  harmony of the languishing soul which he that hears shall never be  confounded.  Thou art the moderator and rule of morals, which he who  follows shall not sin.  By thee kings reign and princes decree justice.  By thee, rid of their native rudeness, their minds and tongues being  polished, the thorns of vice being torn up by the roots, those men  attain high places of honour, and become fathers of their country, and  companions of princes, who without thee would have melted their spears  into pruning-hooks and ploughshares, or would perhaps be feeding swine  with the prodigal.    Where dost thou chiefly lie hidden, O most elect treasure! and where  shall thirsting souls discover thee?    Certes, thou hast placed thy tabernacle in books, where the Most High,  the Light of lights, the Book of Life, has established thee.  There  everyone who asks receiveth thee, and everyone who seeks finds thee,  and to everyone that knocketh boldly it is speedily opened.  Therein  the cherubim spread out their wings,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#2)"],[1,"  or a very low Nile, when Hasha suddenly found itself a mile away from  the channel and there was no good place to land. So it was that Hasha,  with little inspection, was the least reputable and almost the dirtiest  town on the Nile; for even in those far-off days the official Englishman  had his influence, especially when Kubar Pasha was behind him. Kubar had  his good points.    There were certain definite reasons, however, why Fielding Bey shrank  from visiting Hasha. Donovan Pasha saw something was wrong from the  first moment Hasha was mentioned.    On a particular day they were lying below at another village, on the  Amenhotep. Hasha was the next place marked red on the map, and that  meant inspection. When Dicky Donovan mentioned Hasha, Fielding Bey  twisted a shoulder and walked nervously up and down the deck. He stayed  here for hours: to wait for the next post, he said-serious matters  expected from head quarters. He appeared not to realise that letters  would get to Hasha by rail as quickly as by the Amenhotep.    Every man has a weak spot in his character, a sub-rosa, as it were, in  his business of life; and Dicky fancied he had found Fielding Bey's.  While they waited, Fielding made a pretence of working hard--for  he really was conscientious--sending his orderly for the  mamour--[magistrate]--and the omdah--[head of a village]--, and holding  fatuous conferences; turning the hose on the local dairymen and butchers  and dategrowers, who came with backsheesh in kind; burying his nose in  official papers; or sending for Holgate, the Yorkshire engineer, to find  out what the run would be to the next stopping-place beyond Hasha. Twice  he did this; which was very little like Fielding Bey. The second time,  when Holgate came below to his engine, Dicky was there playing with a  Farshoot dog.    \"We don't stop at Hasha, then?\" Dicky asked, and let the Farshoot fasten  on his leggings.    Holgate swung round and eyed Dicky curiously, a queer smile at his lips.    \"Not if Goovnur can 'elp, aw give ye ma woord, sir,\" answered Holgate.    Fielding was affectionately called \"the Governor\" by his subordinates  and friends.    \"We all have our likes and dislikes,\" rejoined Dicky casually, and blew  smoke in the eyes of the Farshoot. \"Aye, aw've seen places that bad! but  Hasha has taaste of its own in Goovnur's mouth, ma life on't!\"    \"Never can tell when a thing'll pall on the taste. Hasha's turn with the  Governor now, eh?\" rejoined Dicky.    Dicky's way of getting information seemed guileless, and Holgate opened  his basket as wide as he knew. \"Toorn, didst tha sway\" (Holgate talked  broadly to Dicky always, for Dicky had told him of his aunt, Lady  Carmichael, who lived near Halifax in Yorkshire), \"toorn, aw warrant! It  be reg'lar as kitchen-fire, this Hasha business, for three years, ever  sin' aw been scrapin' mud o' Nile River.\"    \"That was a nasty row they had over the cemetery three years ago, the  Governor against the lot, from mamour to wekeel!\"    Holgate's eyes flashed, and he looked almost angrily down at Dicky,  whose hand was between the teeth of the playful Farshoot.    \"Doost think--noa, tha canst not think that Goovnur be 'feared o' Hasha  fook. Thinks't tha, a man that told 'em all--a thousand therr--that he'd  hang on nearest tree the foorst that disobeyed him, thinks't tha that  Goovnur's lost his nerve by that?\"    \"The Governor never loses his nerve, Holgate,\" said Dicky, smiling and  offering a cigar. \"There's such a thing as a man being afraid to trust  himself where he's been in a mess, lest he hit out, and doesn't want  to.\"    Holgate, being excited, was in a fit state to tell the truth, if he knew  it; which was what Dicky had worked for; but Holgate only said:    \"It bean't fear, and it bean't milk o' human kindness. It be soort o'  thing a man gets. Aw had it once i' Bradford, in Little Cornish Street.  Aw saw a faace look out o' window o' hoose by tinsmith's shop, an' that  faace was like hell's picture-aye, 'twas a killiagous faace that! Aw  never again could pass that house. 'Twas a woman's faace. Horrible  'twas, an' sore sad an' flootered aw were, for t' faace was like a lass  aw loved when aw wur a lad.\"    \"I should think it was something like that,\" answered Dicky, his eyes  wandering over the peninsula beyond which lay Hasha.    \"Summat, aw be sure,\" answered Holgate, \"an' ma woord on't... ah, yon  coomes orderly wi' post for Goovnur. Now it be Hasha, or it be not  Hasha, it be time for steam oop.\"    Holgate turned to his engine as Dicky mounted the stairs and went  to Fielding's cabin, where the orderly was untying a handkerchief  overflowing with letters.    As Fielding read his official letters his face fell more and more. When  he had read the last, he sat for a minute without speaking, his brow  very black. There was no excuse for pushing past Hasha. He had not been  there for over a year. It was his duty to inspect the place: he had  a conscience; there was time to get to Hasha that afternoon. With an  effort he rose, hurried along the deck, and called down to Holgate:  \"Full-steam to Hasha!\"    Then, with a quick command to the reis, who was already at the wheel,  he lighted a cigar, and, joining Dicky Donovan, began to smoke and talk  furiously. But he did not talk of Hasha.    At sunset the Amenhotep drew in to the bank by Hasha, and, from  the deck, Fielding Bey saluted the mamour, the omdah and his own  subordinates, who, buttoning up their coats as they came, hurried to the  bank to make salaams to him. Behind them, at a distance, came villagers,  a dozen ghaffirs armed with naboots of dom-wood, and a brace of  well-mounted, badly-dressed policemen, with seats like a monkey on a  stick. The conferences with the mamour and omdah were short, in keeping  with the temper of \"Fielding Saadat\"; and long into the night Dicky lay  and looked out of his cabin window to the fires on the banks, where sat  Mahommed Seti the servant, the orderly, and some attendant ghaffirs,  who, feasting on the remains of the effendi's supper, kept watch. For  Hasha was noted for its robbers. It was even rumoured that the egregious  Selamlik Pasha, with the sugar plantation near by--\"Trousers,\" Dicky  called him when he saw him on the morrow, because of the elephantine  breeks he wore--was not averse to sending his Abyssinian slaves through  the sugar-cane to waylay and rob, and worse, maybe.    By five o'clock next day the inspection was over. The streets had been  swept for the Excellency--which is to say Saadat--the first time in a  year. The prison had been cleaned of visible horrors, the first time in  a month. The last time it was ordered there had been a riot among the  starving, infested prisoners; earth had been thrown over the protruding  bones of the dear lamented dead in the cemetery; the water of the  ablution places in the mosque had been changed; the ragged policemen  had new putties; the kourbashes of the tax-gatherers were hid in their  yeleks; the egregious Pasha wore a greasy smile, and the submudir, as he  conducted Fielding--\"whom God preserve and honour!\"--through the prison  and through the hospital, where goat's milk had been laid on for this  especial day, smirked gently through the bazaar above his Parisian  waistcoat.    But Fielding, as he rode on Selamlik Pasha's gorgeous black donkey from  Assiout, with its crimson trappings, knew what proportion of improvement  this \"hankypanky,\" as Dicky called it, bore to the condition of things  at the last inspection. He had spoken little all day, and Dicky had  noticed that his eye was constantly turning here and there, as though  looking for an unwelcome something or somebody.    At last the thing was over, and they were just crossing the canal, the  old Bahr-el-Yusef, which cuts the town in twain as the river Abana does  Damascus, when Dicky saw nearing them a heavily-laden boat, a cross  between a Thames house-boat and an Italian gondola, being drawn by one  poor raw-bone--raw-bone in truth, for there was on each shoulder a round  red place, made raw by the unsheathed ropes used as harness. The beast's  sides were scraped as a tree is barked, and the hind quarters gored as  though by a harrow. Dicky was riding with the mamour of the district,  Fielding was a distance behind with Trousers and the Mudir. Dicky pulled  up his donkey, got off and ran towards the horse, pale with fury; for  he loved animals better than men, and had wasted his strength beating  donkey-boys with the sticks they used on their victims. The boat had  now reached a point opposite the mudirieh, its stopping-place; and the  raw-bone, reeking with sweat and blood, stood still and trembled, its  knees shaking with the strain just taken off them, its head sunk nearly  to the ground.    Dicky had hardly reached the spot when a figure came running to the  poor waler with a quick stumbling motion. Dicky drew back in wonder,  for never had he seen eyes so painful as these that glanced from the  tortured beast to himself--staring, bulbous, bloodshot, hunted eyes;  but they were blue, a sickly, faded blue; and they were English! Dicky's  hand was, on his pistol, for his first impulse had been to shoot the  rawbone; but it dropped away in sheer astonishment at the sight of this  strange figure in threadbare dirty clothes and riding-breeches made by  shearing the legs of a long pair--cut with an unsteady hand, for the  edges were jagged and uneven, and the man's bare leg showed above the  cast-off putties of a policeman. The coat was an old khaki jacket of  a Gippy soldier, and, being scant of buttons, doubtful linen showed  beneath. Above the hook-nose, once aristocratic, now vulture-like  and shrunken like that of Rameses in his glass case at Ghizeh, was a  tarboosh tilting forward over the eyes, nearly covering the forehead.  The figure must have been very tall once, but it was stooped now, though  the height was still well above medium."]]]
