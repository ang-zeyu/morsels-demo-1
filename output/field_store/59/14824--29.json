Masterless, penniless, and with my only means of livelihood, fighting,  gone, I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to  retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold.    I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate  officer, Captain James K. Powell of Richmond.  We were extremely  fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and  privations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein  that our wildest dreams had ever pictured.  Powell, who was a mining  engineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a million  dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months.    As our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us  must return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery and  return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine.    As Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanical  requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to  make the trip.  It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against  the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector.    On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our  burros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started down  the mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage of  his journey.    The morning of Powell's departure was, like nearly all Arizona  mornings, clear and beautiful; I could see him and his little pack  animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, and  all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as  they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau.  My last sight  of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of  the range on the opposite side of the valley.    Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley  and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same  place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals.  I am not  given to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself  that all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on his  trail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assure  myself.    Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian,  and we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to  ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious  marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll in  lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless  clutches.    Powell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indian  fighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in  the North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party of  cunning trailing Apaches.  Finally I could endure the suspense no  longer, and, arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine, I  strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse,  started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning.    As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a  canter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upon  dusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell.  They were the tracks of unshod ponies, three of them, and the ponies  had been galloping.    I followed rapidly until, darkness shutting down, I was forced to await  the rising of the moon, and given an opportunity to speculate on the  question of the wisdom of my chase.  Possibly I had conjured up  impossible dangers, like some nervous old housewife, and when I should  catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains.  However, I  am not prone to sensitiveness, and the following of a sense of duty,  wherever it may lead, has always been a kind of fetich with me  throughout my life; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me  by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and  powerful emperor and several lesser kings, in whose service my sword  has been red many a time.    About nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed  on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast  walk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, I  reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp.  I came upon  the spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs of  having been recently occupied as a camp.    I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen, for  such I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell with only  a brief stop at the hole for water; and always at the same rate of  speed as his.    I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished  to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so I  urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hope  that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.    Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two  shots far ahead of me.  I knew that Powell would need me now if ever,  and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and  difficult mountain trail.    I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further  sounds, when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small, open plateau  near the summit of the pass.  I had passed through a narrow,  overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land,  and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay.    The little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees, and  there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some  object near the center of the camp.  Their attention was so wholly  riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me, and I  easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and  made my escape with perfect safety.  The fact, however, that this  thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any  possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this  episode might possibly otherwise entitle me.    I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes,  because, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts  have placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single one  where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many  hours later.  My mind is evidently so constituted that I am  subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to  tiresome mental processes.  However that may be, I have never regretted  that cowardice is not optional with me.    In this instance I was, of course, positive that Powell was the center  of attraction, but whether I thought or acted first I do not know, but  within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had  whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of  warriors, shooting rapidly, and whooping at the top of my lungs.  Singlehanded, I could not have pursued better tactics, for the red men,  convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars  was upon them, turned and fled in every direction for their bows,  arrows, and rifles.    The view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with  apprehension and with rage.  Under the clear rays of the Arizona moon  lay Powell, his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the  braves.  That he was already dead I could not but be convinced, and yet  I would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches  as quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death.    Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle, and grasping his  cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount.  A backward  glance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more  hazardous than to continue across the plateau, so, putting spurs to my  poor beast, I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could  distinguish on the far side of the table land.    The Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I was  pursued with imprecations, arrows, and rifle balls.  The fact that it  is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight,  that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent,  and that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various  deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows  of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized.    My horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I had  probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass  than he, and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the  summit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carry  me to the valley and to safety.  It is probable, however, that to this  fact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which  befell me during the following ten years.    My first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard the  yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off  to my left.    I knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock  formation at the edge of the plateau, to the right of which my horse  had borne me and the body of Powell.    I drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below  and to my left, and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing  around the point of a neighboring peak.    I knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong  trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right  direction as soon as they located my tracks.

It was agreed that  it was a great pity that the coach should be so hard to pull, and there  was a sense of general relief when the specially bad piece of road was  gotten over. This relief was not, indeed, wholly on account of the  team, for there was always some danger at these bad places of a general  overturn in which all would lose their seats.    It must in truth be admitted that the main effect of the spectacle of  the misery of the toilers at the rope was to enhance the passengers'  sense of the value of their seats upon the coach, and to cause them to  hold on to them more desperately than before. If the passengers could  only have felt assured that neither they nor their friends would ever  fall from the top, it is probable that, beyond contributing to the  funds for liniments and bandages, they would have troubled themselves  extremely little about those who dragged the coach.    I am well aware that this will appear to the men and women of the  twentieth century an incredible inhumanity, but there are two facts,  both very curious, which partly explain it. In the first place, it was  firmly and sincerely believed that there was no other way in which  Society could get along, except the many pulled at the rope and the few  rode, and not only this, but that no very radical improvement even was  possible, either in the harness, the coach, the roadway, or the  distribution of the toil. It had always been as it was, and it always  would be so. It was a pity, but it could not be helped, and philosophy  forbade wasting compassion on what was beyond remedy.    The other fact is yet more curious, consisting in a singular  hallucination which those on the top of the coach generally shared,  that they were not exactly like their brothers and sisters who pulled  at the rope, but of finer clay, in some way belonging to a higher order  of beings who might justly expect to be drawn. This seems  unaccountable, but, as I once rode on this very coach and shared that  very hallucination, I ought to be believed. The strangest thing about  the hallucination was that those who had but just climbed up from the  ground, before they had outgrown the marks of the rope upon their  hands, began to fall under its influence. As for those whose parents  and grand-parents before them had been so fortunate as to keep their  seats on the top, the conviction they cherished of the essential  difference between their sort of humanity and the common article was  absolute. The effect of such a delusion in moderating fellow feeling  for the sufferings of the mass of men into a distant and philosophical  compassion is obvious. To it I refer as the only extenuation I can  offer for the indifference which, at the period I write of, marked my  own attitude toward the misery of my brothers.    In 1887 I came to my thirtieth year. Although still unmarried, I was  engaged to wed Edith Bartlett. She, like myself, rode on the top of the  coach. That is to say, not to encumber ourselves further with an  illustration which has, I hope, served its purpose of giving the reader  some general impression of how we lived then, her family was wealthy.  In that age, when money alone commanded all that was agreeable and  refined in life, it was enough for a woman to be rich to have suitors;  but Edith Bartlett was beautiful and graceful also.    My lady readers, I am aware, will protest at this. \"Handsome she might  have been,\" I hear them saying, \"but graceful never, in the costumes  which were the fashion at that period, when the head covering was a  dizzy structure a foot tall, and the almost incredible extension of the  skirt behind by means of artificial contrivances more thoroughly  dehumanized the form than any former device of dressmakers. Fancy any  one graceful in such a costume!\" The point is certainly well taken, and  I can only reply that while the ladies of the twentieth century are  lovely demonstrations of the effect of appropriate drapery in accenting  feminine graces, my recollection of their great-grandmothers enables me  to maintain that no deformity of costume can wholly disguise them.    Our marriage only waited on the completion of the house which I was  building for our occupancy in one of the most desirable parts of the  city, that is to say, a part chiefly inhabited by the rich. For it must  be understood that the comparative desirability of different parts of  Boston for residence depended then, not on natural features, but on the  character of the neighboring population. Each class or nation lived by  itself, in quarters of its own. A rich man living among the poor, an  educated man among the uneducated, was like one living in isolation  among a jealous and alien race. When the house had been begun, its  completion by the winter of 1886 had been expected. The spring of the  following year found it, however, yet incomplete, and my marriage still  a thing of the future. The cause of a delay calculated to be  particularly exasperating to an ardent lover was a series of strikes,  that is to say, concerted refusals to work on the part of the  brick-layers, masons, carpenters, painters, plumbers, and other trades  concerned in house building. What the specific causes of these strikes  were I do not remember. Strikes had become so common at that period  that people had ceased to inquire into their particular grounds. In one  department of industry or another, they had been nearly incessant ever  since the great business crisis of 1873. In fact it had come to be the  exceptional thing to see any class of laborers pursue their avocation  steadily for more than a few months at a time.    The reader who observes the dates alluded to will of course recognize  in these disturbances of industry the first and incoherent phase of the  great movement which ended in the establishment of the modern  industrial system with all its social consequences. This is all so  plain in the retrospect that a child can understand it, but not being  prophets, we of that day had no clear idea what was happening to us.  What we did see was that industrially the country was in a very queer  way. The relation between the workingman and the employer, between  labor and capital, appeared in some unaccountable manner to have become  dislocated. The working classes had quite suddenly and very generally  become infected with a profound discontent with their condition, and an  idea that it could be greatly bettered if they only knew how to go  about it. On every side, with one accord, they preferred demands for  higher pay, shorter hours, better dwellings, better educational  advantages, and a share in the refinements and luxuries of life,  demands which it was impossible to see the way to granting unless the  world were to become a great deal richer than it then was. Though they  knew something of what they wanted, they knew nothing of how to  accomplish it, and the eager enthusiasm with which they thronged about  any one who seemed likely to give them any light on the subject lent  sudden reputation to many would-be leaders, some of whom had little  enough light to give. However chimerical the aspirations of the  laboring classes might be deemed, the devotion with which they  supported one another in the strikes, which were their chief weapon,  and the sacrifices which they underwent to carry them out left no doubt  of their dead earnestness.    As to the final outcome of the labor troubles, which was the phrase by  which the movement I have described was most commonly referred to, the  opinions of the people of my class differed according to individual  temperament. The sanguine argued very forcibly that it was in the very  nature of things impossible that the new hopes of the workingmen could  be satisfied, simply because the world had not the wherewithal to  satisfy them. It was only because the masses worked very hard and lived  on short commons that the race did not starve outright, and no  considerable improvement in their condition was possible while the  world, as a whole, remained so poor. It was not the capitalists whom  the laboring men were contending with, these maintained, but the  iron-bound environment of humanity, and it was merely a question of the  thickness of their skulls when they would discover the fact and make up  their minds to endure what they could not cure.    The less sanguine admitted all this. Of course the workingmen's  aspirations were impossible of fulfillment for natural reasons, but  there were grounds to fear that they would not discover this fact until  they had made a sad mess of society. They had the votes and the power  to do so if they pleased, and their leaders meant they should. Some of  these desponding observers went so far as to predict an impending  social cataclysm. Humanity, they argued, having climbed to the top  round of the ladder of civilization, was about to take a header into  chaos, after which it would doubtless pick itself up, turn round, and  begin to climb again. Repeated experiences of this sort in historic and  prehistoric times possibly accounted for the puzzling bumps on the  human cranium. Human history, like all great movements, was cyclical,  and returned to the point of beginning. The idea of indefinite progress  in a right line was a chimera of the imagination, with no analogue in  nature. The parabola of a comet was perhaps a yet better illustration  of the career of humanity. Tending upward and sunward from the aphelion  of barbarism, the race attained the perihelion of civilization only to  plunge downward once more to its nether goal in the regions of chaos.    This, of course, was an extreme opinion, but I remember serious men  among my acquaintances who, in discussing the signs of the times,  adopted a very similar tone. It was no doubt the common opinion of  thoughtful men that society was approaching a critical period which  might result in great"]]]
