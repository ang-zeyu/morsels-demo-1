Unc Nunkie  took this right-hand path and Ojo followed without asking why. He knew  it would take them to the house of the Crooked Magician, whom he had  never seen but who was their nearest neighbor.    All the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon Unc and  Ojo sat on a fallen tree-trunk and ate the last of the bread which the  old Munchkin had placed in his pocket. Then they started on again and  two hours later came in sight of the house of Dr. Pipt.    It was a big house, round, as were all the Munchkin houses, and painted  blue, which is the distinctive color of the Munchkin Country of Oz.  There was a pretty garden around the house, where blue trees and blue  flowers grew in abundance and in one place were beds of blue cabbages,  blue carrots and blue lettuce, all of which were delicious to eat. In  Dr. Pipt's garden grew bun-trees, cake-trees, cream-puff bushes, blue  buttercups which yielded excellent blue butter and a row of  chocolate-caramel plants. Paths of blue gravel divided the vegetable  and flower beds and a wider path led up to the front door. The place  was in a clearing on the mountain, but a little way off was the grim  forest, which completely surrounded it.    Unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby, pleasant-faced  woman, dressed all in blue, opened it and greeted the visitors with a  smile.    \"Ah,\" said Ojo; \"you must be Dame Margolotte, the good wife of Dr.  Pipt.\"    \"I am, my dear, and all strangers are welcome to my home.\"    \"May we see the famous Magician, Madam?\"    \"He is very busy just now,\" she said, shaking her head doubtfully. \"But  come in and let me give you something to eat, for you must have  traveled far in order to get our lonely place.\"    \"We have,\" replied Ojo, as he and Unc entered the house. \"We have come  from a far lonelier place than this.\"    \"A lonelier place! And in the Munchkin Country?\" she exclaimed. \"Then  it must be somewhere in the Blue Forest.\"    \"It is, good Dame Margolotte.\"    \"Dear me!\" she said, looking at the man, \"you must be Unc Nunkie, known  as the Silent One.\" Then she looked at the boy. \"And you must be Ojo  the Unlucky,\" she added.    \"Yes,\" said Unc.    \"I never knew I was called the Unlucky,\" said Ojo, soberly; \"but it is  really a good name for me.\"    \"Well,\" remarked the woman, as she bustled around the room and set the  table and brought food from the cupboard, \"you were unlucky to live all  alone in that dismal forest, which is much worse than the forest around  here; but perhaps your luck will change, now you are away from it. If,  during your travels, you can manage to lose that 'Un' at the beginning  of your name 'Unlucky,' you will then become Ojo the Lucky, which will  be a great improvement.\"    \"How can I lose that 'Un,' Dame Margolotte?\"    \"I do not know how, but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps  the chance will come to you,\" she replied.    Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life. There was a  savory stew, smoking hot, a dish of blue peas, a bowl of sweet milk of  a delicate blue tint and a blue pudding with blue plums in it. When the  visitors had eaten heartily of this fare the woman said to them:    \"Do you wish to see Dr. Pipt on business or for pleasure?\"    Unc shook his head.    \"We are traveling,\" replied Ojo, \"and we stopped at your house just to  rest and refresh ourselves. I do not think Unc Nunkie cares very much  to see the famous Crooked Magician; but for my part I am curious to  look at such a great man.\"    The woman seemed thoughtful.    \"I remember that Unc Nunkie and my husband used to be friends, many  years ago,\" she said, \"so perhaps they will be glad to meet again. The  Magician is very busy, as I said, but if you will promise not to  disturb him you may come into his workshop and watch him prepare a  wonderful charm.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied the boy, much pleased. \"I would like to do that.\"    She led the way to a great domed hall at the back of the house, which  was the Magician's workshop. There was a row of windows extending  nearly around the sides of the circular room, which rendered the place  very light, and there was a back door in addition to the one leading to  the front part of the house. Before the row of windows a broad seat was  built and there were some chairs and benches in the room besides. At  one end stood a great fireplace, in which a blue log was blazing with a  blue flame, and over the fire hung four kettles in a row, all bubbling  and steaming at a great rate. The Magician was stirring all four of  these kettles at the same time, two with his hands and two with his  feet, to the latter, wooden ladles being strapped, for this man was so  very crooked that his legs were as handy as his arms.    Unc Nunkie came forward to greet his old friend, but not being able to  shake either his hands or his feet, which were all occupied in  stirring, he patted the Magician's bald head and asked: \"What?\"    \"Ah, it's the Silent One,\" remarked Dr. Pipt, without looking up, \"and  he wants to know what I'm making. Well, when it is quite finished this  compound will be the wonderful Powder of Life, which no one knows how  to make but myself. Whenever it is sprinkled on anything, that thing  will at once come to life, no matter what it is. It takes me several  years to make this magic Powder, but at this moment I am pleased to say  it is nearly done. You see, I am making it for my good wife Margolotte,  who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own. Sit down and make  yourself comfortable, Unc Nunkie, and after I've finished my task I  will talk to you.\"    \"You must know,\" said Margolotte, when they were all seated together on  the broad window-seat, \"that my husband foolishly gave away all the  Powder of Life he first made to old Mombi the Witch, who used to live  in the Country of the Gillikins, to the north of here. Mombi gave to  Dr. Pipt a Powder of Perpetual Youth in exchange for his Powder of  Life, but she cheated him wickedly, for the Powder of Youth was no good  and could work no magic at all.\"    \"Perhaps the Powder of Life couldn't either,\" said Ojo.    \"Yes; it is perfection,\" she declared. \"The first lot we tested on our  Glass Cat, which not only began to live but has lived ever since. She's  somewhere around the house now.\"    \"A Glass Cat!\" exclaimed Ojo, astonished.    \"Yes; she makes a very pleasant companion, but admires herself a little  more than is considered modest, and she positively refuses to catch  mice,\" explained Margolotte. \"My husband made the cat some pink brains,  but they proved to be too high-bred and particular for a cat, so she  thinks it is undignified in her to catch mice. Also she has a pretty  blood-red heart, but it is made of stone--a ruby, I think--and so is  rather hard and unfeeling. I think the next Glass Cat the Magician  makes will have neither brains nor heart, for then it will not object  to catching mice and may prove of some use to us.\"    \"What did old Mombi the Witch do with the Powder of Life your husband  gave her?\" asked the boy.    \"She brought Jack Pumpkinhead to life, for one thing,\" was the reply.  \"I suppose you've heard of Jack Pumpkinhead. He is now living near the  Emerald City and is a great favorite with the Princess Ozma, who rules  all the Land of Oz.\"    \"No; I've never heard of him,\" remarked Ojo. \"I'm afraid I don't know  much about the Land of Oz. You see, I've lived all my life with Unc  Nunkie, the Silent One, and there was no one to tell me anything.\"    \"That is one reason you are Ojo the Unlucky,\" said the woman, in a  sympathetic tone. \"The more one knows, the luckier he is, for knowledge  is the greatest gift in life.\"    \"But tell me, please, what you intend to do with this new lot of the  Powder of Life, which Dr. Pipt is making. He said his wife wanted it  for some especial purpose.\"    \"So I do,\" she answered. \"I want it to bring my Patchwork Girl to life.\"    \"Oh! A Patchwork Girl? What is that?\" Ojo asked, for this seemed even  more strange and unusual than a Glass Cat.    \"I think I must show you my Patchwork Girl,\" said Margolotte, laughing  at the boy's astonishment, \"for she is rather difficult to explain. But  first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant  to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the  dishes. No servant will come here because the place is so lonely and  out-of-the-way, so my clever husband, the Crooked Magician, proposed  that I make a girl out of some sort of material and he would make her  live by sprinkling over her the Powder of Life. This seemed an  excellent suggestion and at once Dr. Pipt set to work to make a new  batch of his magic powder. He has been at it a long, long while, and so  I have had plenty of time to make the girl. Yet that task was not so  easy as you may suppose. At first I couldn't think what to make her of,  but finally in searching through a chest I came across an old patchwork  quilt, which my grandmother once made when she was young.\"    \"What is a patchwork quilt?\" asked Ojo.    \"A bed-quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth,  all neatly sewed together. The patches are of all shapes and sizes, so  a patchwork quilt is a very pretty and gorgeous thing to look at.  Sometimes it is called a 'crazy-quilt,' because the patches and colors  are so mixed up. We never have used my grandmother's many-colored  patchwork quilt, handsome as it is, for we Munchkins do not care for  any color other than blue, so it has been packed away in the chest for  about a hundred years. When I found it, I said to myself that it would  do nicely for my servant girl, for when she was brought to life she  would not be proud nor haughty, as the Glass Cat is, for such a  dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as  dignified as the blue Munchkins are.\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#2)"],[1," Jo Cone, so called because the trees  in his orchard bore crops of excellent ice-cream cones.    \"Jo,\" said Ann, \"I am going to conquer the world, and you must join my  Army.\"    \"Excuse me, please,\" said Jo Cone. \"I am a bad fighter. My good wife  conquered me years ago, for she can fight better than I. Take her, Your  Majesty, instead of me, and I'll bless you for the favor.\"    \"This must be an army of men--fierce, ferocious warriors,\" declared  Ann, looking sternly upon the mild little man.    \"And you will leave my wife here in Oogaboo?\" he asked.    \"Yes; and make you a General.\"    \"I'll go,\" said Jo Cone, and Ann went on to the cottage of Jo Clock,  who had an orchard of clock-trees. This man at first insisted that he  would not join the army, but Queen Ann's promise to make him a General  finally won his consent.    \"How many Generals are there in your army?\" he asked.    \"Four, so far,\" replied Ann.    \"And how big will the army be?\" was his next question.    \"I intend to make every one of the eighteen men in Oogaboo join it,\"  she said.    \"Then four Generals are enough,\" announced Jo Clock. \"I advise you to  make the rest of them Colonels.\"    Ann tried to follow his advice. The next four men she visited--who were  Jo Plum, Jo Egg, Jo Banjo and Jo Cheese, named after the trees in their  orchards--she made Colonels of her Army; but the fifth one, Jo Nails,  said Colonels and Generals were getting to be altogether too common in  the Army of Oogaboo and he preferred to be a Major. So Jo Nails, Jo  Cake, Jo Ham and Jo Stockings were all four made Majors, while the next  four--Jo Sandwich, Jo Padlocks, Jo Sundae and Jo Buttons--were  appointed Captains of the Army.    But now Queen Ann was in a quandary. There remained but two other men  in all Oogaboo, and if she made these two Lieutenants, while there were  four Captains, four Majors, four Colonels and four Generals, there was  likely to be jealousy in her army, and perhaps mutiny and desertions.    One of these men, however, was Jo Candy, and he would not go at all. No  promises could tempt him, nor could threats move him. He said he must  remain at home to harvest his crop of jackson-balls, lemon-drops,  bonbons and chocolate-creams. Also he had large fields of crackerjack  and buttered pop corn to be mowed and threshed, and he was determined  not to disappoint the children of Oogaboo by going away to conquer the  world and so let the candy crop spoil.    Finding Jo Candy so obstinate, Queen Ann let him have his own way and  continued her journey to the house of the eighteenth and last man in  Oogaboo, who was a young fellow named Jo Files. This Files had twelve  trees which bore steel files of various sorts; but also he had nine  book-trees, on which grew a choice selection of story-books. In case  you have never seen books growing upon trees, I will explain that those  in Jo Files' orchard were enclosed in broad green husks which, when  fully ripe, turned to a deep red color. Then the books were picked and  husked and were ready to read. If they were picked too soon, the  stories were found to be confused and uninteresting and the spelling  bad. However, if allowed to ripen perfectly, the stories were fine  reading and the spelling and grammar excellent.    Files freely gave his books to all who wanted them, but the people of  Oogaboo cared little for books and so he had to read most of them  himself, before they spoiled. For, as you probably know, as soon as the  books were read the words disappeared and the leaves withered and  faded--which is the worst fault of all books which grow upon trees.    When Queen Ann spoke to this young man Files, who was both intelligent  and ambitious, he said he thought it would be great fun to conquer the  world. But he called her attention to the fact that he was far superior  to the other men of her army. Therefore, he would not be one of her  Generals or Colonels or Majors or Captains, but claimed the honor of  being sole Private.    Ann did not like this idea at all.    \"I hate to have a Private Soldier in my army,\" she said; \"they're so  common. I am told that Princess Ozma once had a private soldier, but  she made him her Captain-General, which is good evidence that the  private was unnecessary.\"    \"Ozma's army doesn't fight,\" returned Files; \"but your army must fight  like fury in order to conquer the world. I have read in my books that  it is always the private soldiers who do the fighting, for no officer  is ever brave enough to face the foe. Also, it stands to reason that  your officers must have some one to command and to issue their orders  to; therefore I'll be the one. I long to slash and slay the enemy and  become a hero. Then, when we return to Oogaboo, I'll take all the  marbles away from the children and melt them up and make a marble  statue of myself for all to look upon and admire.\"    Ann was much pleased with Private Files. He seemed indeed to be such a  warrior as she needed in her enterprise, and her hopes of success took  a sudden bound when Files told her he knew where a gun-tree grew and  would go there at once and pick the ripest and biggest musket the tree  bore.          Chapter Two    Out of Oogaboo      Three days later the Grand Army of Oogaboo assembled in the square in  front of the royal palace. The sixteen officers were attired in  gorgeous uniforms and carried sharp, glittering swords. The Private had  picked his gun and, although it was not a very big weapon, Files tried  to look fierce and succeeded so well that all his commanding officers  were secretly afraid of him.    The women were there, protesting that Queen Ann Soforth had no right to  take their husbands and fathers from them; but Ann commanded them to  keep silent, and that was the hardest order to obey they had ever  received.    The Queen appeared before her Army dressed in an imposing uniform of  green, covered with gold braid. She wore a green soldier-cap with a  purple plume in it and looked so royal and dignified that everyone in  Oogaboo except the Army was glad she was going. The Army was sorry she  was not going alone.    \"Form ranks!\" she cried in her shrill voice.    Salye leaned out of the palace window and laughed.    \"I believe your Army can run better than it can fight,\" she observed.    \"Of course,\" replied General Bunn, proudly. \"We're not looking for  trouble, you know, but for plunder. The more plunder and the less  fighting we get, the better we shall like our work.\"    \"For my part,\" said Files, \"I prefer war and carnage to anything. The  only way to become a hero is to conquer, and the story-books all say  that the easiest way to conquer is to fight.\"    \"That's the idea, my brave man!\" agreed Ann. \"To fight is to conquer  and to conquer is to secure plunder and to secure plunder is to become  a hero. With such noble determination to back me, the world is mine!  Good-bye, Salye. When we return we shall be rich and famous. Come,  Generals; let us march.\"    At this the Generals straightened up and threw out their chests. Then  they swung their glittering swords in rapid circles and cried to the  Colonels:    \"For-ward March!\"    Then the Colonels shouted to the Majors: \"For-ward March!\" and the  Majors yelled to the Captains: \"For-ward March!\" and the Captains  screamed to the Private:    \"For-ward March!\"    So Files shouldered his gun and began to march, and all the officers  followed after him. Queen Ann came last of all, rejoicing in her noble  army and wondering why she had not decided long ago to conquer the  world.    In this order the procession marched out of Oogaboo and took the narrow  mountain pass which led into the lovely Fairyland of Oz.          Chapter Three    Magic Mystifies the Marchers      Princess Ozma was all unaware that the Army of Oogaboo, led by their  ambitious Queen, was determined to conquer her Kingdom. The beautiful  girl Ruler of Oz was busy with the welfare of her subjects and had no  time to think of Ann Soforth and her disloyal plans. But there was one  who constantly guarded the peace and happiness of the Land of Oz and  this was the Official Sorceress of the Kingdom, Glinda the Good.    In her magnificent castle, which stands far north of the Emerald City  where Ozma holds her court, Glinda owns a wonderful magic Record Book,  in which is printed every event that takes place anywhere, just as soon  as it happens.    The smallest things and the biggest things are all recorded in this  book. If a child stamps its foot in anger, Glinda reads about it; if a  city burns down, Glinda finds the fact noted in her book.    The Sorceress always reads her Record Book every day, and so it was she  knew that Ann Soforth, Queen of Oogaboo, had foolishly assembled an  army of sixteen officers and one private soldier, with which she  intended to invade and conquer the Land of Oz.    There was no danger but that Ozma, supported by the magic arts of  Glinda the Good and the powerful Wizard of Oz--both her firm  friends--could easily defeat a far more imposing army than Ann's; but  it would be a shame to have the peace of Oz interrupted by any sort of  quarreling or fighting. So Glinda did not even mention the matter to  Ozma, or to anyone else. She merely went into a great chamber of her  castle, known as the Magic Room, where she performed a magical ceremony  which caused the mountain pass that led from Oogaboo to make several  turns and twists. The result was that when Ann and her army came to the  end of the pass they were not in the Land of Oz at all, but in an  adjoining territory that was quite distinct from Ozma's domain and  separated from Oz by an invisible barrier.    As the Oogaboo people emerged into this country, the pass they had  traversed disappeared behind them and it was not likely they would ever  find their way back into the valley of Oogaboo. They were greatly  puzzled, indeed, by their surroundings and did not know which way to  go. None of them"]]]
