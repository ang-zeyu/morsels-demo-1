Persons born and bred on the  pampas, when they first visit a mountainous district, frequently  experience a sensation as of \"a ball in the throat\" which seems to  prevent free respiration.    In most places the rich, dry soil is occupied by a coarse grass, three  or four feet high, growing in large tussocks, and all the year round of  a deep green; a few slender herbs and trefoils, with long, twining  stems, maintain a frail existence among the tussocks; but the strong  grass crowds out most plants, and scarcely a flower relieves its uniform  everlasting verdure. There are patches, sometimes large areas, where it  does not grow, and these are carpeted by small creeping herbs of a  livelier green, and are gay in spring with flowers, chiefly of the  composite and papilionaceous kinds; and verbenas, scarlet, purple, rose,  and white. On moist or marshy grounds there are also several lilies,  yellow, white, and red, two or three flags, and various other small  flowers; but altogether the flora of the pampas is the poorest in  species of any fertile district on the globe. On moist clayey ground  flourishes the stately pampa grass, Gynerium argenteum, the spears of  which often attain a height of eight or nine feet. I have ridden through  many leagues of this grass with the feathery spikes high as my head, and  often higher. It would be impossible for me to give anything like an  adequate idea of the exquisite loveliness, at certain times and seasons,  of this queen of grasses, the chief glory of the solitary pampa.  Everyone is familiar with it in cultivation; but the garden-plant has a  sadly decaying, draggled look at all times, and to my mind, is often  positively ugly with its dense withering mass of coarse leaves, drooping  on the ground, and bundle of spikes, always of the same dead white or  dirty cream-colour. Now colour--the various ethereal tints that give a  blush to its cloud-like purity--is one of the chief beauties of this  grass on its native soil; and travellers who have galloped across the  pampas at a season of the year when the spikes are dead, and white as  paper or parchment, have certainly missed its greatest charm. The plant  is social, and in some places where scarcely any other kind exists it  covers large areas with a sea of fleecy-white plumes; in late summer,  and in autumn, the tints are seen, varying from the most delicate rose,  tender and illusive as the blush on the white under-plumage of some  gulls, to purple and violaceous. At no time does it look so perfect as  in the evening, before and after sunset, when the softened light imparts  a mistiness to the crowding plumes, and the traveller cannot help  fancying that the tints, which then seem richest, are caught from the  level rays of the sun, or reflected from the coloured vapours of the  afterglow.    The last occasion on which I saw the pampa grass in its full beauty was  at the close of a bright day in March, ending in one of those perfect  sunsets seen only in the wilderness, where no lines of house or hedge  mar the enchanting disorder of nature, and the earth and sky tints are  in harmony. I had been travelling all day with one companion, and for  two hours we had ridden through the matchless grass, which spread away  for miles on every side, the myriads of white spears, touched with  varied colour, blending in the distance and appearing almost like the  surface of a cloud. Hearing a swishing sound behind us, we turned  sharply round, and saw, not forty yards away in our rear, a party of  five mounted Indians, coming swiftly towards us: but at the very moment  we saw them their animals came to a dead halt, and at the same instant  the five riders leaped up, and stood erect on their horses' backs.  Satisfied that they had no intention of attacking us, and were only  looking out for strayed horses, we continued watching them for some  time, as they stood gazing away over the plain in different directions,  motionless and silent, like bronze men on strange horse-shaped pedestals  of dark stone; so dark in their copper skins and long black hair,  against the far-off ethereal sky, flushed with amber light; and at their  feet, and all around, the cloud of white and faintly-blushing plumes.  That farewell scene was printed very vividly on my memory, but cannot be  shown to another, nor could it be even if a Ruskin's pen or a Turner's  pencil were mine; for the flight of the sea-mew is not more impossible  to us than the power to picture forth the image of Nature in our souls,  when she reveals herself in one of those \"special moments\" which have  \"special grace\" in situations where her wild beauty has never been  spoiled by man.    At other hours and seasons the general aspect of the plain is  monotonous, and in spite of the unobstructed view, and the unfailing  verdure and sunshine, somewhat melancholy, although never sombre: and  doubtless the depressed and melancholy feeling the pampa inspires in  those who are unfamiliar with it is due in a great measure to the  paucity of life, and to the profound silence. The wind, as may well be  imagined on that extensive level area, is seldom at rest; there, as in  the forest, it is a \"bard of many breathings,\" and the strings it  breathes upon give out an endless variety of sorrowful sounds, from the  sharp fitful sibilations of the dry wiry grasses on the barren places,  to the long mysterious moans that swell and die in the tall polished  rushes of the marsh. It is also curious to note that with a few  exceptions the resident birds are comparatively very silent, even those  belonging to groups which elsewhere are highly loquacious. The reason of  this is not far to seek. In woods and thickets, where birds abound  most, they are continually losing sight of each other, and are only  prevented from scattering by calling often; while the muffling effect on  sound of the close foliage, to' which may be added a spirit of emulation  where many voices are heard, incites most species, especially those that  are social, to exert their voices to the utmost pitch in singing,  calling, and screaming. On the open pampas, birds, which are not  compelled to live concealed on the surface, can see each other at long  distances, and perpetual calling is not needful: moreover, in that still  atmosphere sound travels far. As a rule their voices are strangely  subdued; nature's silence has infected them, and they have become silent  by habit. This is not the case with aquatic species, which are nearly  all migrants from noisier regions, and mass themselves in lagoons and  marshes, where they are all loquacious together. It is also noteworthy  that the subdued bird-voices, some of which are exceedingly sweet and  expressive, and the notes of many of the insects and batrachians have a  great resemblance, and seem to be in accord with the aeolian tones of  the wind in reeds and grasses: a stranger to the pampas, even a  naturalist accustomed to a different fauna, will often find it hard to  distinguish between bird, frog, and insect voices.    The mammalia is poor in species, and with the single exception of the  well-known vizcacha (Lagostomus trichodactylus), there is not one of  which it can truly be said that it is in any special way the product of  the pampas, or, in other words, that its instincts are better suited to  the conditions of the pampas than to those of other districts. As a  fact, this large rodent inhabits a vast extent of country, north, west,  and south of the true pampas, but nowhere is he so thoroughly on his  native heath as on the great grassy plain. There, to some extent, he  even makes his own conditions, like the beaver. He lives in a small  community of twenty or thirty members, in a village of deep-chambered  burrows, all with their pit-like entrances closely grouped together; and  as the village endures for ever, or for an indefinite time, the earth  constantly being brought up forms a mound thirty or forty feet in  diameter; and this protects the habitation from floods on low or level  ground. Again, he is not swift of foot, and all rapacious beasts are his  enemies; he also loves to feed on tender succulent herbs and grasses, to  seek for which he would have to go far afield among the giant grass,  where his watchful foes are lying in wait to seize him; he saves himself  from this danger by making a clearing all round his abode, on which a  smooth turf is formed; and here the animals feed and have their evening  pastimes in comparative security: for when an enemy approaches, he is  easily seen; the note of alarm is sounded, and the whole company  scuttles away to their refuge. In districts having a different soil and  vegetation, as in Patagonia, the vizcachas' curious, unique instincts  are of no special advantage, which makes it seem probable that they have  been formed on the pampas.    How marvellous a thing it seems that the two species of mammalians--the  beaver and the vizcacha--that most nearly simulate men's intelligent  actions in their social organizing instincts, and their habitations,  which are made to endure, should belong to an order so low down as the  Rodents! And in the case of the latter species, it adds to the marvel  when we find that the vizcacha, according to Water-house, is the lowest  of the order in its marsupial affinities.    The vizcacha is the most common rodent on the pampas, and the Rodent  order is represented by the largest number of species. The finest is the  so-called Patagonian hare--Dolichotis patagonica--a beautiful animal  twice as large as a hare, with ears shorter and more rounded, and legs  relatively much longer. The fur is grey and chestnut brown. It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#2)"],[1,"of Governor King.

Australia is the only considerable portion of the world which has enjoyed  the blessed record of unruffled peace. On every other continent, in  nearly every other island large in area, \"war's red ruin writ in flame\"  has wrought its havoc, leaving evidences in many a twinging cicatrice.  Invasion, rebellion, and civil war constitute enormous elements in the  chronicles of nations; and Shelley wrote that the study of history,  though too important to be neglected, was \"hateful and disgusting to my  very soul,\" because he found in it little more than a \"record of crimes  and miseries.\" A map of the globe, coloured crimson as to those countries  where blood has flowed in armed conflicts between men, would present a  circling splash of red; but the vast island which is balanced on the  Tropic of Capricorn, and spreads her bulk from the tenth parallel of  south latitude to \"the roaring forties,\" would show up white in the  spacious diagram of carnage.
