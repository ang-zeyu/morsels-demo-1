The logbooks of the Lady Nelson bear witness to the leading part played  by one small British ship in the discovery of a great continent. They  show how closely, from the date of her first coming to Sydney in 1800  until her capture by pirates off the island of Baba in 1825, this little  brig was identified with the colonisation and development of Australia.    In entering upon her eventful colonial career, \"the Lady Nelson did that  which alone ought to immortalize her name--she was the first ship that  ever sailed parallel to the entire southern coast line of Australia.\"* (*  Early History of Victoria by F.P. Labilliere.) She was also the first  vessel to sail through Bass Strait. But discovery cannot claim her solely  for itself. While she was stationed at Sydney there was scarcely a  dependency of the mother colony that was not more or less indebted to  her, either for proclaiming it a British possession, or for bringing it  settlers and food, or for providing it with means of defence against the  attacks of natives.    In the early history of Victoria the Lady Nelson occupies a niche  somewhat similar to that which the Endeavour fills in the annals of New  South Wales, but while Cook and the Endeavour discovered the east coast  and then left it, the Lady Nelson, after charting the bare coast-line of  Victoria, returned again and again to explore its inlets and to penetrate  its rivers, her boats discovering the spacious harbour at the head of  which Melbourne now stands.    The Lady Nelson also went northward as well as southward, and though many  of her logbooks are missing, some survive, and one describes how, in  company with the Investigator under Captain Flinders, she examined the  Queensland shore as far as the Cumberland Islands. Later she accompanied  the Mermaid, under Captain King, to Port Macquarie when he followed  Flinders' track through Torres Strait, and during her long period of  service she visited different parts of the coast, including Moreton Bay,  Port Essington, and Melville Island. Precisely how many voyages she made  as a pioneer will probably never be known. The ship, at least, played  many parts: now acting as King's messenger and carrying despatches from  the Governor to Norfolk Island; now fetching grain grown at the  Hawkesbury, or coals from Newcastle for the use of the increasing  population at Sydney; and at another time carrying troops and settlers to  the far distant north. She made other memorable voyages; for example,  when she conveyed bricks burnt in Sydney brick kilns to Tasmania and to  New Zealand, in order to build homes for the first white settlers in  those lands. She helped also to establish Lieutenant Bowen's colony at  Risdon. On that occasion we read that the little ship lent the colony a  bell and half a barrel of gunpowder. The logbooks do not record to what  use the bell was put, but whether it served as a timekeeper or to call  the people to worship, it was doubtless highly valued by the early  Tasmanian colonists.    At the time of her sailing to Australia the Lady Nelson was a new ship of  60 tons. She was built at Deptford in 1799, and differed from other  exploring vessels in having a centre-board keel. This was the invention  of Captain John Schanck, R.N., who believed that ships so constructed  \"would sail faster, steer easier, tack and wear quicker and in less  room.\" He had submitted his design to the Admiralty in 1783, and so well  was it thought of that two similar boats had been built for the Navy, one  with a centre-board and one without, in order that a trial might be made.  The result was so successful that, besides the Cynthia sloop and Trial  revenue cutter, other vessels were constructed on the new plan, among  them the Lady Nelson. She was chosen for exploration because her three  sliding centre-boards enabled her draught to be lessened in shallow  waters, for when her sliding keels were up she drew no more than six  feet.    In 1799 the news reached London that the French were fitting out an  expedition to survey unknown portions of Australia; the Admiralty were  quickly stirred to renewed activity, and decided to send the Lady Nelson  to Sydney. At first it was believed that Captain Flinders would be placed  in charge of her, but he was eventually given a more important command,  and Lieutenant James Grant was appointed to the Lady Nelson. She was  hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the river on January 13th, 1800, with  her full complement of men and stores on board. She carried provisions  for 15 men for a period of nine months, and enough water for three  months. Her armament consisted of only two brass carriage-guns.    On January 16th she sailed to Gravesend. So small did she look as she  made her way down the Thames that the sailors on board the ships in the  river ridiculed her appearance and ironically christened her \"His  Majesty's Tinderbox.\" Grant says that many expressed a doubt that she  would ever make her port of destination.    A heavy gale was blowing when she reached the Downs, but from the first  she proved herself a good sea-boat, and it was found that lowering the  keels greatly steadied her. Grant now had a good opportunity for testing  her capabilities. A large convoy ready to sail for the West Indies lay at  anchor here, and on the evening of the 23rd, as the fury of the wind  increased, many signals of distress were seen flying in the offing.  Finding the Lady Nelson drag very much, her commander let go another  anchor, with the result that she rode out through the gale with ease,  although next morning six vessels were ashore dismasted, while two others  had lost both their masts and bowsprits. He then decided to take shelter  in Ramsgate, where he remained until the 7th, when he sailed to Spithead  and thence to Portsmouth. Here four more guns were placed on board and  some oak planking, which caused the brig to lie deeper in the water, so  that Grant writes \"there were then only 2 feet 9 inches clear abreast the  gangway.\" He believed, however, that the consumption of coal and  provisions would soon bring her to a proper degree of buoyancy.    During her stay at Portsmouth the Lady Nelson lost two men, one through  illness, the other by desertion. On March 15th, when she was quite ready  for sea, Captain Schanck and Mr. Bayley* (* W. Bayley, formerly  astronomer on board the Adventure.) paid her a visit. Orders had been  given for her to leave port in company with H.M.S. Anson, Captain Durham,  who (as the Powers were at war) was to convoy a fleet of East Indiamen,  then on point of sailing, and with whom was H.M.S. Porpoise, bound to New  South Wales. The wind being fair, on the night of March 16th, 1800, the  signal for sailing was given by the Commodore. While all hands were  busily engaged getting up the kedge, the carpenter made his escape in the  darkness. Anxious to avoid further delay, and somewhat consoled by the  thought that the vessel was new and that he had already tested and found  out her good qualities, Lieutenant Grant decided to put up with the loss  of the man's services.    At 6 P.M. on the 18th the ship finally bade adieu to England. At first  she was scarcely able to keep pace with the big ships which bore her  company, and very soon the Commodore despatched an officer to her  commander to suggest that he should go into Falmouth and await there the  departure of the West India Fleet. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7514"],[0,"A Guide to Stoicism (#2)"],[1,"man was essentially a  rational animal, his work as man lay in living the rational life. And  the perfection of reason was virtue. Hence the ways of nature were no  other than the ways of virtue. And so it came about that the Stoic  formula might be expressed in a number of different ways which yet  all amounted to the same thing. The end was to live the virtuous  life, or to live consistently, or to live in accordance with nature,  or to live rationally.      DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY.    Philosophy was defined by the Stoics as 'the knowledge of things  divine and human'. It was divided into three departments; logic,  ethic, and physic. This division indeed was in existence before their  time, but they have got the credit of it as of some other things  which they did not originate. Neither was it confined to them, but  was part of the common stock of thought. Even the Epicureans, who are  said to have rejected logic can hardly be counted as dissentients  from this threefold division. For what they did was to substitute for  the Stoic logic a logic of their own, dealing with the notions  derived from sense, much in the same way as Bacon substituted his  Novum Organum for the Organon of Aristotle. Cleanthes we are told  recognised six parts of philosophy, namely, dialectic, rhetoric,  ethic, politic, physic, and theology, but these are obviously the  result of subdivision of the primary ones. Of the three departments  we may say that logic deals with the form and expression of  knowledge, physic with the matter of knowledge, and ethic with the  use of knowledge. The division may also be justified in this way.  Philosophy must study either nature (including the divine nature) or  man; and, if it studies man, it must regard him either from the side  of the intellect or of the feelings, that is either as a thinking  (logic) or as an acting (ethic) being.    As to the order in which the different departments should be studied,  we have had preserved to us the actual words of Chrysippus in his  fourth book on Lives. 'First of all then it seems to me that, as has  been rightly said by the ancients, there are three heads under which  the speculations of the philosopher fall, logic, ethic, physic; next,  that of these the logical should come first, the ethical second, and  the physical third, and that of the physical the treatment of the  gods should come last, whence also they have given the name of  \"completions\" to the instruction delivered on this subject'. That  this order however might yield to convenience is plain from another  book on the use of reason, where he says that 'the student who takes  up logic first need not entirely abstain from the other branches of  philosophy, but should study them also as occasion offers.'    Plutarch twits Chrysippus with inconsistency, because in the face of  this declaration as to the order of treatment, he nevertheless says  that morals rest upon physics. But to this charge it may fairly be  replied that the order of exposition need not coincide with the order  of existence. Metaphysically speaking, morals may depend upon physics  and the right conduct of man be deducible from the structure of the  universe but for all that, it may be advisable to study physics  later. Physics meant the nature of God and the Universe. Our nature  may be deducible from that but it is better known to ourselves to  start with, so that it may be well to begin from the end of the stick  that we have in our hands. But that Chrysippus did teach the logical  dependence of morals on physics is plain from his own words. In his  third book on the Gods he says 'for it is not possible to find any  other origin of justice or mode of its generation save that from Zeus  and the nature of the universe for anything we have to say about good  and evil must needs derive its origin therefrom', and again in his  Physical Theses, 'for there is no other or more appropriate way of  approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness  than from the nature of all things and the administration of the  universe--for it is to these we must attach the treatment of good and  evil inasmuch as there is no better origin to which we can refer them  and inasmuch as physical speculation is taken in solely with a view  to the distinction between good and evil.'    The last words are worth noting as showing that even with Chrysippus  who has been called the intellectual founder of Stoicism the whole  stress of the philosophy of the Porch fell upon its moral teaching.  It was a favourite metaphor with the school to compare philosophy to  a fertile vineyard or orchard. Ethic was the good fruit, physic the  tall plants, and logic the strong wall. The wall existed only to  guard the trees, and the trees only to produce the fruit. Or again  philosophy was likened to an egg of which ethic was the yolk  containing the chick, physic the white which formed its nourishment  while logic was the hard outside shell. Posidonius, a later member of  the school, objected to the metaphor from the vineyard on the ground  that the fruit and the trees and the wall were all separable whereas  the parts of philosophy were inseparable. He preferred therefore to  liken it to a living organism, logic being the bones and sinews,  physic the flesh and blood, but ethic the soul.      LOGIC    The Stoics had a tremendous reputation for logic. In this department  they were the successors or rather the supersessors of Aristotle. For  after the death of Theophrastus the library of the Lyceum is said to  have been buried underground at Scepsis until about a century before  Christ, So that the Organon may actually have been lost to the world  during that period. At all events under Strato the successor of  Theophrastus who specialized in natural science the school had lost  its comprehensiveness. Cicero even finds it consonant with dramatic  propriety to make Cato charge the later Peripatetics with ignorance  of logic! On the other hand Chrysippus became so famous for his logic  as to create a general impression that if there were a logic among  the gods it would be no other than the Chrysippean.    But if the Stoics were strong in logic they were weak in rhetoric.  This strength and weakness were characteristic of the school at all  periods. Cato is the only Roman Stoic to whom Cicero accords the  praise of real eloquence. In the dying accents of the school as we  hear them in Marcus Aurelius the imperial sage counts it a thing to  be thankful for that he had learnt to abstain from rhetoric, poetic,  and elegance of diction. The reader however cannot help wishing that  he had taken some means to diminish the crabbedness of his style. If  a lesson were wanted in the importance of sacrificing to the Graces  it might be found in the fact that the early Stoic writers despite  their logical subtlety have all perished and that their remains have  to be sought for so largely in the pages of Cicero. In speaking of  logic as one of the three departments of philosophy we must bear in  mind that the term was one of much wider meaning than it is with us.  It included rhetoric, poetic, and grammar as well as dialectic or  logic proper, to say nothing of disquisitions on the senses and the  intellect which we should now refer to psychology.    Logic as a whole being divided into rhetoric and dialectic: rhetoric  was defined to be the knowledge of how to speak well in expository  discourses and dialectic as the knowledge of how to argue rightly in  matters of question and answer. Both rhetoric and dialectic were  spoken of by the Stoics as virtues for they divided virtue in its  most generic sense in the same way as they divided philosophy into  physical, ethical, and logical. Rhetoric and dialectic were thus the  two species of logical virtue. Zeno expressed their difference by  comparing rhetoric to the palm and dialectic to the fist.    Instead of throwing in poetic and grammar with rhetoric, the Stoics  subdivided dialectic into the part which dealt with the meaning and  the part which dealt with the sound, or as Chrysippus phrased it,  concerning significants and significates. Under the former came the  treatment of the alphabet, of the parts of speech, of solecism, of  barbarism, of poems, of amphibolies, of metre and music--a list which  seems at first sight a little mixed, but in which we can recognise  the general features of grammar, with its departments of phonology,  accidence, and prosody. The treatment of solecism and barbarism in  grammar corresponded to that of fallacies in logic. With regard to  the alphabet it is worth noting that the Stoics recognised seven  vowels and six mutes. This is more correct than our way of talking of  nine mutes, since the aspirate consonants are plainly not mute. There  were, according to the Stoics, five parts of speech--name,  appellative, verb, conjunction, article. 'Name' meant a proper name,  and 'appellative' a common term.    There were reckoned to be five virtues of speech--Hellenism,  clearness, conciseness, propriety, distinction. By 'Hellenism' was  meant speaking good Greek. 'Distinction' was defined to be 'a diction  which avoided homeliness.' Over against these there were two  comprehensive vices, barbarism and solecism, the one being an offence  against accidence, the other against syntax.    The famous comparison of the infant mind to a blank sheet of paper,  which we connect so closely with the name of Locke, really comes from  the Stoics. The earliest characters inscribed upon it were the  impressions of sense, which the Greeks called \"phantasies.\" A  phantasy was defined by Zeno as \"an impression in the soul.\"  Cleanthes was content to take this definition in its literal sense,  and believe that the soul was impressed by external objects as wax by  a signet ring. Chrysippus, however, found a difficulty here, and  preferred to interpret the Master's saying to mean an alteration or  change in the"]]]
