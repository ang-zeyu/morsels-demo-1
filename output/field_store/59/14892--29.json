He means that it is a symbol, an essential  condition, and a part of something that goes deeper into life than any  geometry of earth's absurd, passionate, futile, and very necessary  antics would suggest.    It is a universal fallacy that because works like the comedies of  Aristophanes discuss certain social or ethical problems, they are  inspired by them. Aristophanes wrote to express his vision on life, his  delight in life itself seen behind the warping screen of contemporary  event; and for his purposes anything from Euripides to Cleon served as  ground work. Not that he would think in those terms, naturally: but the  rationalizing process that goes on in consciousness during the creation  of a work of art, for all its appearance of directing matters, is the  merest weathercock in the wind of the subconscious intention. As an  example of how utterly it is possible to misunderstand the springs of  inspiration in a poem, we may take the following remark of B. B. Rogers:  _It is much to be regretted that the phallus element should be so  conspicuous in this play.... (This) coarseness, so repulsive to  ourselves, was introduced, it is impossible to doubt, for the express  purpose of counter-balancing the extreme earnestness and gravity of the  play_. It seems so logical, so irrefutable; and so completely  misinterprets every creative force of Aristophanes' Psyche that it  certainly deserves a little admiration. It is in the best academic  tradition, and everyone respects a man for writing so mendaciously. The  effort of these castrators is always to show that the parts considered  offensive are not the natural expression of the poet, that they are  dictated externally. They argue that Shakespeare's coarseness is the  result of the age and not personal predilection, completely ignoring the  work of men like Sir Philip Sidney and Spenser, indeed practically all  the pre-Shakespearean writers, in whom none of this so-called grossness  exists. Shakespeare wrote sculduddery because he liked it, and for no  other reason; his sensuality is the measure of his vitality. These liars  pretend similarly that because Rabelais had a humanistic reason for much  of his work--the destructior Mediaevalism, and the Church, which purpose  they construe of course as an effort to purify, etc.--therefore he only  put the lewdery to make the rest palatable, when it should be obvious  even to an academic how he glories in his wild humour.    What the academic cannot understand is that in such works, while  attacking certain conditions, the creative power of the vigorous spirits  is so great that it overflows and saturates the intellectual conception  with their own passionate sense of life. It is for this reason that  these works have an eternal significance. If Rabelais were merely a  social reformer, then the value of his work would not have outlived his  generation. If _Lysistrata_ were but a wise political tract, it would  have merely an historical interest, and it would have ceased spiritually  at 404 B.C.    But Panurge is as fantastic and fascinating a character now as he was  300 years ago, Lysistrata and her girls as freshly bodied as any girl  kissed to-day. Therefore the serious part of the play is that which  deals with them, the frivolous part that in which Rogers detects gravity  and earnestness.    Aristophanes is the lord of all who take life as a gay adventure, who  defy all efforts to turn life into a social, economic, or moral  abstraction. Is it therefore just that the critics who, by some dark  instinct, unerringly pick out the exact opposite of any creator's real  virtues as his chief characteristics, should praise him as an idealistic  reformer? An \"ideal\" state of society was the last thing Aristophanes  desired. He wished, certainly, to eliminate inhumanities and baseness;  but only that there might be free play for laughter, for individual  happiness.    Consequently the critics lay the emphasis on the effort to cleanse  society, not the method of laughter. Aristophanes wished to destroy  Cleon because that demagogue failed to realize the poet's conception of  dignified government and tended to upset the stability of Hellas. But it  was the stability of life, the vindication of all individual freedoms,  in which he was ultimately interested.

Good day Calonice.    CALONICE    Good day Lysistrata.  But what has vexed you so? Tell me, child.  What are these black looks for? It doesn't suit you  To knit your eyebrows up glumly like that.    LYSISTRATA    Calonice, it's more than I can bear,  I am hot all over with blushes for our sex.  Men say we're slippery rogues--    CALONICE    And aren't they right?    LYSISTRATA    Yet summoned on the most tremendous business  For deliberation, still they snuggle in bed.    CALONICE    My dear, they'll come. It's hard for women, you know,  To get away. There's so much to do;  Husbands to be patted and put in good tempers:  Servants to be poked out: children washed  Or soothed with lullays or fed with mouthfuls of pap.    LYSISTRATA    But I tell you, here's a far more weighty object.    CALONICE    What is it all about, dear Lysistrata,  That you've called the women hither in a troop?  What kind of an object is it?    LYSISTRATA    A tremendous thing!    CALONICE    And long?    LYSISTRATA    Indeed, it may be very lengthy.    CALONICE    Then why aren't they here?    LYSISTRATA    No man's connected with it;  If that was the case, they'd soon come fluttering along.  No, no. It concerns an object I've felt over  And turned this way and that for sleepless nights.    CALONICE    It must be fine to stand such long attention.    LYSISTRATA    So fine it comes to this--Greece saved by Woman!    CALONICE    By Woman? Wretched thing, I'm sorry for it.    LYSISTRATA    Our country's fate is henceforth in our hands:  To destroy the Peloponnesians root and branch--    CALONICE    What could be nobler!    LYSISTRATA    Wipe out the Boeotians--    CALONICE    Not utterly. Have mercy on the eels!  [Footnote: The Boeotian eels were highly esteemed delicacies in Athens.]    LYSISTRATA    But with regard to Athens, note I'm careful  Not to say any of these nasty things;  Still, thought is free.... But if the women join us  From Peloponnesus and Boeotia, then  Hand in hand we'll rescue Greece.    CALONICE    How could we do  Such a big wise deed? We women who dwell  Quietly adorning ourselves in a back-room  With gowns of lucid gold and gawdy toilets  Of stately silk and dainty little slippers....    LYSISTRATA    These are the very armaments of the rescue.  These crocus-gowns, this outlay of the best myrrh,  Slippers, cosmetics dusting beauty, and robes  With rippling creases of light.    CALONICE    Yes, but how?    LYSISTRATA    No man will lift a lance against another--    CALONICE    I'll run to have my tunic dyed crocus.    LYSISTRATA    Or take a shield--    CALONICE    I'll get a stately gown.    LYSISTRATA    Or unscabbard a sword--    CALONICE    Let me buy a pair of slipper.    LYSISTRATA    Now, tell me, are the women right to lag?    CALONICE    They should have turned birds, they should have grown  wings and flown.    LYSISTRATA    My friend, you'll see that they are true Athenians:  Always too late. Why, there's not a woman  From the shoreward demes arrived, not one from Salamis.    CALONICE    I know for certain they awoke at dawn,  And got their husbands up if not their boat sails.    LYSISTRATA    And I'd have staked my life the Acharnian dames  Would be here first, yet they haven't come either!    CALONICE    Well anyhow there is Theagenes' wife  We can expect--she consulted Hecate.  But look, here are some at last, and more behind them.  See ... where are they from?    CALONICE    From Anagyra they come.    LYSISTRATA    Yes, they generally manage to come first.    _Enter_ MYRRHINE.    MYRRHINE    Are we late, Lysistrata? ... What is that?  Nothing to say?    LYSISTRATA    I've not much to say for you,  Myrrhine, dawdling on so vast an affair.    MYRRHINE    I couldn't find my girdle in the dark.  But if the affair's so wonderful, tell us, what is it?    LYSISTRATA    No, let us stay a little longer till  The Peloponnesian girls and the girls of Bocotia  Are here to listen.    MYRRHINE    That's the best advice.  Ah, there comes Lampito.    _Enter_ LAMPITO.    LYSISTRATA    Welcome Lampito!  Dear Spartan girl with a delightful face,  Washed with the rosy spring, how fresh you look  In the easy stride of your sleek slenderness,  Why you could strangle a bull!

If you'd care?\"    The other rose obediently and followed him down the steep.    Several times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his  movements were slow and hesitating. \"Come in with me,\" said Isbister,  \"and try some cigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol. If you take  alcohol?\"    The stranger hesitated at the garden gate. He seemed no longer clearly  aware of his actions. \"I don't drink,\" he said slowly, coming up the  garden path, and after a moment's interval repeated absently, \"No--I  don't drink. It goes round. Spin, it goes--spin--\"    He stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing of one  who sees nothing.    Then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy chair, seemed almost  to fall into it. He leant forward with his brows on his hands and became  motionless.    Presently he made a faint sound in his throat. Isbister moved about  the room with the nervousness of an inexperienced host, making little  remarks that scarcely required answering. He crossed the room to his  portfolio, placed it on the table and noticed the mantel clock.    \"I don't know if you'd care to have supper with me,\" he said with an  unlighted cigarette in his hand--his mind troubled with a design of  the furtive administration of chloral. \"Only cold mutton, you know, but  passing sweet. Welsh. And a tart, I believe.\" He repeated this after  momentary silence.    The seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped, match in hand,  regarding him.    The stillness lengthened. The match went out, the cigarette was put down  unlit. The man was certainly very still. Isbister took up the portfolio,  opened it, put it down, hesitated, seemed about to speak. \"Perhaps,\" he  whispered doubtfully. Presently he glanced at the door and back to  the figure. Then he stole on tiptoe out of the room, glancing at his  companion after each elaborate pace.    He closed the door noiselessly. The house door was standing open, and  he went out beyond the porch, and stood where the monkshood rose at  the corner of the garden bed. From this point he could see the stranger  through the open window, still and dim, sitting head on hand. He had not  moved.    A number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the  artist curiously. A boatman exchanged civilities with him. He felt  that possibly his circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and  unaccountable. Smoking, perhaps, might seem more natural. He drew pipe  and pouch from his pocket, filled the pipe slowly.    \"I wonder,\"... he said, with a scarcely perceptible loss of complacency.  \"At any rate we must give him a chance.\" He struck a match in the virile  way, and proceeded to light his pipe.    Presently he heard his landlady behind him, coming with his lamp lit  from the kitchen. He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped  her at the door of his sitting-room. He had some difficulty in  explaining the situation in whispers, for she did not know he had a  visitor. She retreated again with the lamp, still a little mystified to  judge from her manner, and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the  porch, flushed and less at his ease.    Long after he had smoked out his pipe, and when the bats were abroad,  his curiosity dominated his complex hesitations, and he stole back into  his darkling sitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The stranger  was still in the same attitude, dark against the window. Save for the  singing of some sailors aboard one of the little slate-carrying ships  in the harbour, the evening was very still. Outside, the spikes of  monkshood and delphinium stood erect and motionless against the shadow  of the hillside. Something flashed into Isbister's mind; he started, and  leaning over the table, listened. An unpleasant suspicion grew stronger;  became conviction. Astonishment seized him and became--dread!    No sound of breathing came from the seated figure!    He crept slowly and noiselessly round the table, pausing twice to  listen. At last he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair. He  bent down until the two heads were ear to ear.    Then he bent still lower to look up at his visitor's face. He started  violently and uttered an exclamation. The eyes were void spaces of  white.    He looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled  under the lids. He was suddenly afraid. Overcome by the strangeness of  the man's condition, he took him by the shoulder and shook him. \"Are you  asleep?\" he said, with his voice jumping into alto, and again, \"Are you  asleep?\"    A conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead. He  suddenly became active and noisy, strode across the room, blundering  against the table as he did so, and rang the bell.    \"Please bring a light at once,\" he said in the passage. \"There is  something wrong with my friend.\"    Then he returned to the motionless seated figure, grasped the shoulder,  shook it, and shouted. The room was flooded with yellow glare as his  astonished landlady entered with the light. His face was white as he  turned blinking towards her. \"I must fetch a doctor at once,\" he said.  \"It is either death or a fit. Is there a doctor in the village? Where is  a doctor to be found?\"          CHAPTER II. THE TRANCE    The state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen, lasted  for an unprecedented length of time, and then he passed slowly to the  flaccid state, to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose. Then it  was his eyes could be closed.    He was removed from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the  surgery, after some weeks, to London. But he still resisted every  attempt at reanimation. After a time, for reasons that will appear  later, these attempts were discontinued. For a great space he lay in  that strange condition, inert and still neither dead nor living but, as  it were, suspended, hanging midway between nothingness and existence.  His was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation, a  dreamless inanition, a vast space of peace. The tumult of his mind had  swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence. Where was the man?  Where is any man when insensibility takes hold of him?    \"It seems only yesterday,\" said Isbister. \"I remember it all as  though it happened yesterday--clearer perhaps, than if it had happened  yesterday.\"    It was the Isbister of the last chapter, but he was no longer a  young man. The hair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the  fashionable length, was iron grey and clipped close, and the face that  had been pink and white was buff and ruddy. He had a pointed beard shot  with grey. He talked to an elderly man who wore a summer suit of drill  (the summer of that year was unusually hot). This was Warming, a London  solicitor and next of kin to Graham, the man who had fallen into the  trance. And the two men stood side by side in a room in a house in  London regarding his recumbent figure.    It was a yellow figure lying lax upon a water-bed and clad in a flowing  shirt, a figure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard, lean limbs and  lank nails, and about it was a case of thin glass. This glass seemed  to mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him, he was a  thing apart, a strange, isolated abnormality. The two men stood close to  the glass, peering in.    \"The thing gave me a shock,\" said Isbister \"I feel a queer sort of  surprise even now when I think of his white eyes. They were white, you  know, rolled up. Coming here again brings it all back to me.    \"Have you never seen him since that time?\" asked Warming.    \"Often wanted to come,\" said Isbister; \"but business nowadays is too  serious a thing for much holiday keeping. I've been in America most of  the time.\"    \"If I remember rightly,\" said Warming, \"you were an artist?\"    \"Was. And then I became a married man. I saw it was all up with black  and white, very soon--at least for a mediocre man, and I jumped on to  process. Those posters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people.\"    \"Good posters,\" admitted the solicitor, \"though I was sorry to see them  there.\"    \"Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary,\" exclaimed Isbister with  satisfaction. \"The world changes. When he fell asleep, twenty years  ago, I was down at Boscastle with a box of water-colours and a noble,  old-fashioned ambition. I didn't expect that some day my pigments would  glorify the whole blessed coast of England, from Land's End round again  to the Lizard. Luck comes to a man very often when he's not looking.\"    Warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck. \"I just missed seeing  you, if I recollect aright.\"    \"You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford railway station.  It was close on the Jubilee, Victoria's Jubilee, because I remember the  seats and flags in Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea.\"    \"The Diamond Jubilee, it was,\" said Warming; \"the second one.\"    \"Ah, yes! At the proper Jubilee--the Fifty Year affair--I was down at  Wookey--a boy. I missed all that.... What a fuss we had with him! My  landlady wouldn't take him in, wouldn't let him stay--he looked so queer  when he was rigid. We had to carry him in a chair up to the hotel. And  the Boscastle doctor--it wasn't the present chap, but the G.P. before  him--was at him until nearly two, with, me and the landlord holding  lights and so forth.\"    \"It was a cataleptic rigour at first, wasn't it?\"    \"Stiff!--wherever you bent him he stuck. You might have stood him on  his head and he'd have stopped. I never saw such stiffness. Of course  this\"--he indicated the prostrate figure by a movement of his head--\"is  quite different. And, of course, the little doctor--what was his name?\"    \"Smithers?\"    \"Smithers it was--was quite wrong in trying to fetch him round too soon,  according to all accounts. The things he did. Even now it makes me feel  all--ugh! Mustard, snuff, pricking. And one of those beastly little "]]]
