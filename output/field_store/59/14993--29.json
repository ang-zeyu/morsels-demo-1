[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#20)"],[1," Saul was slain; but he lived to a good  old age, and never lost his influence over the Israelites, whom he had  rescued from idolatry and to whom he had given political unity. Although  Saul was king, we are told that Samuel judged Israel all the days of his  life. He died universally lamented. There is no record in the Scriptures  of a death attended with such profound and general mourning. All Israel  mourned for him. They mourned because he was a good man, unstained by  crime or folly; they mourned because their judge and oracle and friend  had passed away; they mourned because he had been their intercessor with  God himself, and the interpreter of the divine will. His like would  never appear again in Israel. \"He represents the independence of the  moral law, as distinct from regal and sacerdotal enactments. If a  Levite, he was not a priest. He was a prophet, the first in the regular  succession of prophets. He was also the founder of the first regular  institutions of religious instruction, and communities for the purposes  of education. From these institutions were developed the universities of  Christendom.\"    In a spiritual and religious sense the prophet takes the highest rank  in the kingdom of God on earth. Among the Hebrews he was the interpreter  of the divine will; he predicted future events. He was a preacher of  righteousness; he was the counsellor of kings and princes; he was a sage  and oracle among the people. He was a reformer, teaching the highest  truths and restoring the worship of God when nations were sunk in  idolatry; he was the mouth-piece of the Eternal, for warning, for  rebuke, for encouragement, for chastisement. He was divinely inspired,  armed with supernatural powers,--a man whom the people feared and  obeyed, sometimes honored, sometimes stoned; one who bore heavy  responsibilities, and of whom were demanded disagreeable duties. We  associate with the idea of a prophet both wisdom and virtue, great gifts  and great personal piety. We think of him as a man who lived a secluded  life of meditation and prayer, in constant communion with God and  removed from all worldly rewards,--a man indifferent to ordinary  pleasures, to outward pomp and show, free from personal vanity, lofty in  his bearing, independent in his mode of life, spiritual in his aims,  fervent and earnest in his exhortations, living above the world in the  higher regions of faith and love, disdaining praises and honors, soft  raiment and luxurious food, and maintaining a proud equality with the  greatest personages; a man not to be bought, and not to be deterred  from his purpose by threatenings or intimidation or flatteries,  commanding reverence, and exalted as a favorite of heaven. It was not  necessary that the prophet should be a priest or even a Levite. He was  greater than any impersonation of sacerdotalism, sacred in his person  and awful in his utterances, unassisted by ritualistic forms, declaring  truths which appealed to consciousness,--a kind of spiritual dictator  who inspired awe and reverence.    In one sense or another most of the august characters of the Old  Testament were prophets,--Abraham, Moses, Joseph, David, Elijah, Daniel,  Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel. They either foretold the future, or rebuked  kings as messengers of omnipotence, or taught the people great truths,  or uttered inspired melodies, or interpreted dreams, or in some way  revealed the ways and will of God. Among them were patriarchs, kings,  and priests, and sages uninvested with official functions. Some lived in  cities and others in villages, and others again in the wilderness and  desert places; some reigned in the palaces of pride, and others in the  huts of poverty,--yet all alike exercised a tremendous moral power. They  were the national poets and historians of Judaea, preachers of  patriotism as well as of religion and morals, exercising political as  well as spiritual power. Those who stand out pre-eminently in the  sacred writings were gifted with the power of revealing the future  destinies of nations, and above all other things the peculiarities of  the Messianic reign.    Samuel was not called to declare those profound truths which relate to  the appearance and reign of Christ as the Saviour of mankind, nor the  fate of idolatrous nations, nor even the future vicissitudes connected  with the Hebrew nation, but to found a school of religious teachers, to  revive the worship of Jehovah, guide the conduct of princes, and direct  the general affairs of the nation as commanded by God. He was the first  and most favored of the great prophets, and exercised an influence as a  prophet never equalled by any who succeeded him. He was a great prophet,  since for forty years he ruled Israel by direct divine illumination,--a  holy man who communed with God, great in speech and great in action. He  did not rise to the lofty eloquence of Isaiah, nor foresee the fate of  nations like Daniel and Ezekiel; but he was consulted and obeyed as a  man who knew the divine will, gifted beyond any other man of his age in  spiritual insight, and trusted implicitly for his wisdom and sanctity.  These were the excellences which made him one of the most extraordinary  men in Jewish history, rendering services to his nation which cannot  easily be exaggerated.          DAVID.      1055-1015 B.C.    ISRAELITISH CONQUESTS.      Considering how much has been written about David in all the nations of  Christendom, and how familiar Christian people are with his life and  writings, it would seem presumptuous to attempt a lecture on this  remarkable man, especially since it is impossible to add anything  essentially new to the subject. The utmost that I can do is to select,  condense, and rearrange from the enormous quantity of matter which  learned and eloquent writers have already furnished.    The warrior-king who conquered the enemies of Israel in a dark and  desponding period; the sagacious statesman who gave unity to its various  tribes, and formed them into a powerful monarchy; the matchless poet who  bequeathed to all ages a lofty and beautiful psalmody; the saint, who  with all his backslidings and inconsistencies was a man after God's own  heart,--is well worthy of our study. David was the most illustrious of  all the kings of whom the Jewish nation was proud, and was a striking  type of a good man occasionally enslaved by sin, yet breaking its bonds  and rising above subsequent temptations to a higher plane of goodness. A  man so elevated, with almost every virtue which makes a man beloved, and  yet with defects which will forever stain his memory, cannot easily be  portrayed. What character in history presents such wide contradictions?  What career was ever more varied? What recorded experiences are more  interesting and instructive?--a life of heroism, of adventures, of  triumphs, of humiliations, of outward and inward conflicts. Who ever  loved and hated with more intensity than David?--tender yet fierce,  brave yet weak, magnanimous yet unrelenting, exultant yet sad,  committing crimes yet triumphantly rising after disgraceful falls by the  force of a piety so ardent that even his backslidings now appear but as  spots upon a sun. His varied experiences call out our sympathy and  admiration more than the life of any secular hero whom poetry and  history have immortalized. He was an Achilles and a Ulysses, a Marcus  Aurelius and a Theodosius, an Alfred and a Saint Louis combined; equally  great in war and in peace, in action and in meditation; creating an  empire, yet transmitting to posterity a collection of poems identified  forever with the spiritual life of individuals and nations. Interesting  to us as are the events of David's memorable career, and the sentiments  and sorrows which extort our sympathy, yet it is the relation of a  sinful soul with its Maker, by which he infuses his inner life into all  other souls, and furnishes materials of thought for all generations.    David was the youngest and seventh son of Jesse, a prominent man of the  tribe of Judah, whose great-grandmother was Ruth, the interesting wife  of Boaz the Jew. He was born in Bethlehem, near Jerusalem,--a town  rendered afterward so illustrious as the birthplace of our Lord, who was  himself of the house and lineage of David. He first appears in history  at the sacrificial feast which his townspeople periodically held,  presided over by his father, when the prophet Samuel unexpectedly  appeared at the festival to select from the sons of Jesse a successor to  Saul. He was not tall and commanding like the Benjamite hero, but was  ruddy of countenance, with auburn hair, beautiful eyes, and graceful  figure, equally remarkable for strength and agility. He had the charge  of his father's sheep,--not the most honorable employment in the eyes of  his brothers, who, according to Ewald, treated him with little  consideration; but even as a shepherd boy he had already proved his  strength and courage by an encounter with a bear and a lion.    Until David was thirty years of age his life was identified with the  fading glories of the reign of Saul, who laid the foundation of the  military power of his successors,--a man who lacked only the one quality  imperative on the vicegerent of a supreme but invisible Power, that of  unquestioning obedience to the divine directions as interpreted by the  voice of prophets. Had Saul been loyal in his heart, as David was, to  the God of Israel, the sceptre might not have departed from his  house,--for he showed some of the highest qualities of a general and a  ruler, until his jealousy was excited by the brilliant exploits of the  son of Jesse. On these exploits and subsequent adventures, which invest  David's early career with the fascinations of a knight of chivalry, I  need not dwell. All are familiar with his encounter with Goliath, and  with his slaughter of the Philistines after he had slain the giant,  which called out the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#20)"],[1,"but gingerly; has a large  regard for freedom, but will quarrel if crossed; can achieve  commendable triumphs in the regions of peace, but likes a  conscientious disturbance at intervals; believes in the power of  union, but acts as if a split were occasionally essential; will  nurse its own children well when they are quiet, but recognises the  virtues of a shake if uneasiness supervenes; respects its ministers  much, but will order them to move on if they fret its epidermis too  acutely; can pray well, work well, fight well; and from its  antagonisms can distil benefits. About nine years since, a sacred  stirring of heads, a sharp moving of tongues, and a lively up-  heaving of bristles took place at Cannon-street Congregational  Chapel, in this town. The result of the dispute involved, amongst  other things, a separation--a clear marching from the place of  several parties who, whether rightly or wrongly, matters not now,  felt themselves aggrieved. They did not leave the chapel in  processional order, neither did they throw stones and then run, when  they took their departure. The process of evaporation was quiet and  orderly. For 12 months the seceders worshipped on their own account,  in accordance with the principles of Congregationalism, at the  Institution, Avenham, and whilst there they gathered strength. In  the meantime they negotiated for land upon which to build a new  chapel and schools; and finally they purchased a site on the higher  side of the Orchard, contiguous to the old Vicarage--a rare piece of  antique, rubbishy ruin in these days--and very near, if not actually  upon, ground which once formed the garden of the famous Isaac  Ambrose, who was Vicar of Preston in 1650, and afterwards ejected;  with many more in the land, on account of his religious opinions.  Thinking it good to harmonise with that ancient wisdom which  recommends people to carry the calf before beginning with the cow,  the new band of Congregationalists under notice, commenced  operations on the site named by erecting a large school room in  which for about a year they worshipped. In due time they got the  chapel built, and for about seven years it has been open.    Its position is prominent; but its associations, like those of the  generality of sacred edifices, has a special bearing upon the world  we live in. Above it there is a portion of the old vicarage  buildings, graced in front with various articles, the most prominent  being a string of delapidated red jackets; right facing it we have  the sable Smithsonian Institute, flanked with that gay and festive  lion which is for ever running and never stirring; below there are  classic establishments for rifle-shooting, likeness taking, and hot  pea revelling; and ahead there is the police station. The chapel  stands well, occupies high and commanding ground, and looks rather  stately. Its exterior design is good; and if the stone of its facade  had been of a better quality--had contained fewer flaws and been  more closely jointed--it would have merited one of our best  architectural bows. The chapel and school, and the land upon which  they are erected, cost 7,000 pounds, and about 1,000 pounds of that  sum remains to be paid. This is not bad. Considering the brevity of  their existence and the severe times they have had to pass through,  the Lancaster-road Congregationalists must have worked hard and put  a very vigorous Christian screw into operation to reduce their debt  so rapidly.    The inside of the chapel is plain, very neat, and quite genteel. We  have seen no Congregational place of worship in this part equal to  it in ease and elegance of design. It is amphi-theatrical, is  galleried three quarters round, and derives the bulk of its beauty--  not from ornament, not from rich artistic hues, nor rare mouldings,  nor exquisite carvings, but from its quiet harmony of arrangement,  its simple gracefulness of form, its close adherence in outline and  detail to the laws of symmetry and proportion. The circular style  prevails most in it, and how to make everything round or half-round  seems to have been the supreme job of the designer. The gallery  above, the seats below, the platform, the pulpit on which it stands,  the chairs behind, the orchestra and its canopy, the window-heads,  the surmountings of the entrance screen, the gas pendants, and  scores of other things, have all a strong fondness for circularity;  and the same predilection is manifested outside; the large lamps  there being quite round and fixed upon circular columns. The pews in  the chapel are very strong, have receding backs, and make sitting in  them rather a pleasing, easy, contented affair. The highest price  for a single seat is 3s. 6d. per quarter; the lowest 1s. There are a  few free sittings in the place, and although they may seem a long  way back--being at the rear of the gallery--their position is not to  be despised. They are not so far distant as to render hearing  difficult; and they obviate that unseemly publicity which is given  to poor people in some places of worship. How to give the poorest  and hungriest folk a very good seat in a very prominent place--how  to herd them together and piously pen them up in some particular  place where everybody can see them--appears to be an object in many  religious edifices. But that is a piece of benevolent shabbiness  which must come to grief some day. In the meantime, and until the  period arrives when honest poverty will be considered no crime, and  when a seat next to a poor man will be thought nothing vulgar, or  contaminating, whilst worshipping before Him who cares for souls not  lucre, hearts not wealth, let the poor be put in some place where  they can hear fairly without being unduly exhibited. The chapel we  are noticing has a spacious appearance within, and has none of that  depressing dulness which makes some people very sad long before they  have been ministerially operated upon. From side windows there comes  a good light; and from the roof, which has a central transparency,  additional clearness is obtained. The light from the ceiling would  be improved if the glass it were kept a little cleaner.    The congregation is neither a very large nor a particularly small  one. It is fairly medium--might be worse, and would in no way be  hurt if it were enlarged. The \"members\" number about 120, and they  are just about as good as the rest of mortals, who have \"made their  calling and election sure.\" The congregation consists almost  entirely of middle and working class people. There is not so much of  that high, gassy pride, that fine mezzotinto, isolated hauteur and  self-righteousness in the place which may be seen in some chapels.  Of course, particles of vanity, morsels of straight-lacedness,  lively little bits of cantankerousness, and odd manifestations of  first person pronoun worship periodically crop up; but altogether  the congregation has a quiet, unassuming, friendly disposition.  Nobody in it appears to be very much better or worse than yourself;  there is an evenness of tone and a sociality of feeling in the spot;  and a stranger can enter it without being violently stared at, and  can sit down without feeling that his room is nearly if not quite as  good as his company. The music is fairly congregational; individuals  in various parts of the chapel have sufficient courage to sing; and  the choir is moderately harmonious; but the melody one hears in the  place is rather flat and meagre; it lacks instrumental relief; and  it will never be really up to the mark until an organ is obtained.    The first regular minister of this chapel was the Rev. G. W.  Clapham; he was connected with it for some years; then had a  \"difficulty\" with certain parties--deacons amongst the rest, of  course; and afterwards left the place, uttering, in a quiet  Shaksperian tone, as he departed, \"Now mark how I will undo myself:\"  He threw to the winds his Congregationalism, and a few months ago  joined, in due clerical order, the Church of England. The present  pastor of Lancaster-road Congregational Chapel is the Rev. E.  Bolton. The \"church\" tried the merits of about 30 ministers before  making a selection. The height, depth, weight, tone of voice,  matter, manner, theology, brains, and spirit of that band of 30 were  duly weighed, and finally, Mr. Bolton was picked out. A salary of  300 pounds was offered him. He might have got other places, and if  he had followed the clerical wisdom of his generation he would have  tried to secure one of them; for they all, more or less, implied a  better salary than that which the Preston people offered him. But he  fixed upon Preston just because he fancied more good might be done  therein than elsewhere. A trick like this--a generosity so distinct  as this--is a real oasis in the ecclesiastical desert. Few parsons  would imitate it. How to get the biggest salary, and lug in the  \"will of the Lord\" as an excuse for changing to some locality where  it could be snugly got, is the question which many pious men seem  desirous of solving. Mr. Bolton has different ideas, and finds some  compensation in goodness achieved as well as in money pocketed. He  has been at Lancaster-road Chapel three months, and, unlike many new  parsons, he had more sense than preach his best sermons first--than  make a grand pyrotechnic dash at the onset and settle down into a  round of prating mediocrity afterwards. When tried he gave the  people a fair average specimen of what he could do--did not say his  best nor his commonest things; began with a fire which he could keep  up; and the result is not disappointment, but an increasing relish.    Mr. Bolton is a plain, dark-complexioned, clear-headed man--rather  clerical in look; well-built; married; about 38 years of age; fond  of a billycock; teetotal, but averse to drowning other people with  water; doesn't think it sinful to smoke just one pipe of tobacco  after he"]]]
