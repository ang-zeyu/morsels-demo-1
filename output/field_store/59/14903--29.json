It is the fourth time the ship has moved,  since she was launched from the Navy Yard at Portsmouth. Her first  experience of the ocean was a rough one; she was caught in a wintry gale  from the north-east, dismasted, and towed back into Portsmouth harbor,  within three days after her departure. The second move brought us to New  York; the third, from the Navy Yard into the North river; and the fourth  will probably bring us to an anchorage off Sandy Hook. After a hard winter  of four months, in New Hampshire, we go to broil on the coast of Africa,  with ice enough in our blood to keep us comfortably cool for six months at  least.    At 10 A.M. the steamer cast off, and we anchored inside of Sandy Hook; at  12 Meridian, hoisted the broad pennant of Commodore Perry, and saluted it  with thirteen guns. At 3 P.M. the ship gets under way, and with a good  breeze, stands out to sea. Our parting letters are confided to the Pilot.  That weather-beaten veteran gives you a cordial shake with his broad, hard  hand, wishes you a prosperous cruise, and goes over the side. His life is  full of greetings and farewells; the grasp of his hand assures the  returning mariner that his weary voyage is over; and when the swift pilot  boat hauls her wind, and leaves you to go on your course alone, you feel  that the last connecting link with home is broken. On our ship's deck,  there were perhaps some heart-aches, but no whimpering. Few strain their  eyes to catch parting glimpses of the receding highlands; it is only the  green ones who do that. The Old Salt seeks more substantial solace in his  dinner. It is matter of speculation, moreover, whether much of the misery  of parting does not, with those unaccustomed to the sea, originate in the  disturbed state of their stomachs.    7.--We are in the Gulf-stream. The temperature of the water is ten degrees  above that of the air. Though the ship is deep, being filled with stores,  and therefore sailing heavily, we are yet taken along eleven knots by the  wind, and two or three more by the current. Swiftly as we fly, however, we  are not quite alone upon the waters. Mother Carey's chickens follow us  continually, dipping into the white foam of our track, to seize the food  which our keel turns up for them out of the ocean depths. Mysterious is  the way of this little wanderer over the sea. It is never seen on land;  and naturalists have yet to discover where it reposes, and where it  hatches its young; unless we adopt the idea of the poets, that it builds  its nest upon the turbulent bosom of the deep. It is a sort of nautical  sister of the fabled bird of Paradise, which was footless, and never  alighted out of the air. Hundreds of miles from shore, in sunshine and in  tempest, you may see the Stormy Petrel. Among the unsolvable riddles which  nature propounds to mankind, we may reckon the question, Who is Mother  Carey, and where does she rear her chickens?    9.--We are out of the Gulf-stream, and the ship is now rolling somewhat  less tumultuously than heretofore. For four days, we have been blest with  almost too fair a wind. A strong breeze, right aft, has been taking us  more than two hundred and forty miles a day on our course.  But the  incessant and uneasy motion of the ship deprives us of any steady comfort.  In spite of all precautions, tables, chairs, and books, have tumbled about  in utter confusion, and the monotony is enlivened by the breaking of  bottles and crash of crockery.  As some consolation, our Log Book shows  that we have made more than half of a thousand miles, within the last  forty-eight hours. Land travelling, with all the advantages of railroads,  can hardly compete with the continual diligence of a ship before a  prosperous breeze.    11.--Spoke an American brig from Liverpool, bound for New York. Though the  boat was called away, and our letters were ready, it was all at once  determined not to board her; and, after asking the captain to report us,  we stood on our course again. The newspapers will tell our friends  something of our whereabouts; or, at least, that on a certain day, we were  encountered at a certain point upon the sea.    13.--Wind still fair, and weather always fine. We have not tacked ship  once since leaving Sandy Hook, and are almost ready to quarrel with the  continual fair wind. There is nothing else to find fault with, except the  performances of our French cook in the wardroom, who came on board just  before we left New York, and made us believe that we had obtained a  treasure. He told us that he had cooked for a French Admiral. We swore him  to secrecy on that point, lest the Commodore should be disposed to engage  the services of so distinguished an artist for his own table. But our  self-congratulations were not of long continuance. The sugared omelet  passed with slight remark. The beefsteak smothered in onions was merely  prohibited in future. But when, on the second day, the potatoes were  served with mashed lemon-peel, the general discontent burst forth;  and we  scolded till we laughed again at the dilemma in which we found ourselves.  Next to being without food, is the calamity of being subjected, in the  middle of the Atlantic, to the diabolical arts of the French Admiral's  cook. At sea, the arrangements of the table are of far more importance  than on shore. There are so few incidents, that one's dinner becomes, what  Dr. Johnson affirmed it always to be, the affair of which a man thinks  oftenest in the course of the day.    16.--All day, the wind has been ahead, and very light. This evening, a  dead calm is upon the sea; but the sky is cloudless, and the air pure and  soft. All the well are enjoying the fine weather. The commodore and  captain walk the poop-deck; the other officers, except the lieutenant and  young gentlemen of the watch, are smoking on the forecastle, or  promenading the quarter-deck. A dozen steady old salts are rolling along  the gangways; and the men are clustered in knots between the guns,  talking, laughing, or listening to the yarns of their comrades--an  amusement to which sailors are as much addicted as the Sultan in the  Arabian Nights. But music is the order of the evening. Though a band is  not allowed to a ship of our class, there are always good musicians to be  found among the reckless and jolly fellows composing a man-of-war's crew.  A big landsman from Utica, and a dare-devil topman from Cape Cod, are the  leading vocalists; Symmes, the ship's cook, plays an excellent violin; and  the commodore's steward is not to be surpassed upon the tambourine. A  little black fellow, whose sobriquet is Othello, manages the castanets,  and there is a tolerable flute played by one of the afterguard. The  concerts usually commence with sentimental songs, such as \"Home, sweet  Home,\" and the Canadian Boat Song: but the comic always carries off the  palm; \"Jim along Josey,\" \"Lucy Long,\" \"Old Dan Tucker,\" and a hundred  others of the same character, are listened to delightedly by the crowd of  men and boys collected round the fore-hatch, and always ready to join in  the choruses. Thus a sound of mirth floats far and wide over the twilight  sea, and would seem to indicate that all goes well among us.    But the delicious atmosphere, and the amusements of the ship, bring not  joy to all on board. There are sick men swinging uneasily in their  hammocks; and one poor fellow, whose fever threatens to terminate fatally,  tosses painfully in his cot. His messmates gently bathe his hot brow, and,  watching every movement, nurse him as tenderly as a woman. Strange, that  the rude heart of a sailor should be found to possess such tenderness as  we seldom ask or find, in those of our own sex, on land! There, we leave  the gentler humanities of life to woman; here, we are compelled to imitate  her characteristics, as well as our sterner nature will permit.    22.--The sick man died last night, and was buried to-day. His history was  revealed to no one. Where was his home, or whether he has left friends to  mourn his death, are alike unknown. Dying, he kept his own counsel, and  was content to vanish out of life, even as a speck of foam melts back into  the ocean. At 11 A.M., for the first time, in a cruise likely to be fatal  to many on board, the boatswain piped \"all hands to bury the dead!\" The  sailor's corpse, covered with the union of his country's flag, was placed  in the gangway. Two hundred and fifty officers and men stood around,  uncovered, and reverently listened to the beautiful and solemn burial  service, as it was read by one of the officers. The body was committed to  the deep, while the ship dashed onward, and had left the grave far behind,  even before the last words of the service were uttered. The boatswain  \"piped down,\" and all returned to their duties sadly, and with thoughtful  countenances.    23.--At 4 A.M., the island of Palma and the Peak of Teneriffe are in full  sight, though the lofty summit of the mountain is one hundred miles  distant.    24.--At 5 A.M., anchored at Santa Cruz, capital of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#2)"],[1,"on.    The feeling is, that infinitely more is involved than the capture of a  French town, or even the destruction of a French Army; it is a question  of stamina; it is the climax of the world war, the focal point of the  colossal struggle between the Latin and the Teuton, and on the  battlefields of Verdun the gods will decide the destinies of nations.    When I got to the forward observing position, which was situated among  the ruins of a house, a most amazing noise made conversation difficult.    The orchestra was in full blast and something approaching 12,000 pieces  of all sizes were in action on our side alone, this being the greatest  artillery concentration yet effected during the war.    We were situated on one side of a valley which ran up at right angles  to the river, whose actual course was hidden by mist, which also  obscured the bottom of our valley. The front line was down in this  little valley, and as I arrived we lifted our barrage on to the far  hill-side to cover an attack which we were delivering at dawn.    Nothing could be seen of the conflict down below, but after half an  hour we received orders to bring back our barrage again, and Grabel  informed me that the attack had evidently failed. This afternoon I  heard that it was indeed so, and that one division (the 58th), which  had tried to work along the river bank and outflank the hill, had been  caught by a concentration of six batteries of French 75's, which were  situated across the river. The unfortunate 58th, forced back from the  river-side, had heroically fought their way up the side of the hill,  only to encounter our barrage, which, owing to the mist, we thought was  well above and ahead of where they would be.    Under this fresh blow the 58th had retired to their trenches at the  bottom of the small valley. As the day warmed up the mist disappeared,  and, like a theatre curtain, the lifting of this veil revealed the  whole scene in its terrible and yet mechanical splendour.    I say mechanical, for it all seemed unreal to me. I knew I should not  see cavalry charges, guns in the open, and all the old-world panoply of  war, but I was not prepared for this barren and shell-torn circle of  hills, continually being freshly, and, to an uninformed observer,  aimlessly lashed by shell fire.    Not a man in sight, though below us the ground was thickly strewn with  corpses. Overhead a few aeroplanes circled round amidst balls of white  shell bursts.    During the day the slow-circling aeroplanes (which were artillery  observing machines) were galvanized into frightful activity by the  sudden appearance of a fighting machine on one side or the other; this  happened several times; it reminded me of a pike amongst young trout.    After lunch I saw a Spad shot down in flames, it was like Lucifer  falling down from high heavens. The whole scene was enframed by a  sluggish line of observation balloons.    Sometimes groups of these would hastily sink to earth, to rise again  when the menace of the aeroplane had passed. These balloons seemed more  like phlegmatic spectators at some athletic contest than actual  participants in the events.    I wish my pen could convey to paper the varied impressions created  within my mind in the course of the past day; but it cannot. I have the  consolation that, though I think that I have considerable ability as a  writer, yet abler pens than mine have abandoned in despair the task of  describing a modern battle.    I can but reiterate that the dominant impression that remains is of the  mechanical nature of this business of modern war, and yet such an  impression is a false one, for as in the past so to-day, and so in the  future, it is the human element which is, has been, and will be the  foundation of all things.    Once only in the course of the day did I see men in any numbers, and  that was when at 3 p.m. the French were detected massing for a  counter-attack on the south side of the river. It was doomed to be  still-born. As they left their trenches, distant pigmy figures in  horizon blue, apparently plodding slowly across the ground, they were  lashed by an intensive barrage and the little figures were obliterated  in a series of spouting shell bursts.    Five minutes later the barrage ceased, the smoke drifted away and not a  man was to be seen. Grabel told me that it had probably cost them 750  casualties. What an amazing and efficient destruction of living  organism!           *       *       *       *       *    Another most interesting day, though of a different nature.    To-day was spent witnessing the arrangements for dealing with the  wounded. I spent the morning at an advanced dressing station on the  south bank of the river. It was in a cellar, beneath the ruins of a  house, about 400 yards from the front line and under heavy shell-fire,  as close at hand was the remains of what had been a wood, which was  being used as a concentration point for reserves.    The cover afforded by this so-called wood was extremely slight, and the  troops were concentrating for the innumerable attacks and  counter-attacks which were taking place under shell fire. This caused  the surgeon in charge of the cellar to describe the wood as our main  supply station!    I entered the cellar at 8 a.m., taking advantage of a partial lull in  the shelling, but a machine-gun bullet viciously flipped into a wooden  beam at the entrance as I ducked to go in. I was not sorry to get  underground. A sloping path brought me into the cellar, on one side of  which sappers were digging away the earth to increase the  accommodation.    The illumination consisted of candles set in bottles and some electric  hand lamps. The centre of the cellar was occupied by two portable  operating tables, rarely untenanted during the three hours I spent in  this hell.    The atmosphere--for there was no ventilation--stank of sweat, blood,  and chloroform.    By a powerful effort I countered my natural tendency to vomit, and  looked around me. The sides of the cellar were lined with figures on  stretchers. Some lay still and silent, others writhed and groaned. At  intervals, one of the attendants would call the doctor's attention to  one of the still forms. A hasty examination ensued, and the stretcher  and its contents were removed. A few minutes later the  stretcher--empty--returned. The surgeon explained to me that there was  no room for corpses in the cellar; business, he genially remarked, was  too brisk at the present crucial stage of the great battle.    The first feelings of revulsion having been mastered, I determined to  make the most of my opportunities, as I have always felt that the naval  officer is at a great disadvantage in war as compared with his  military brother, in that he but rarely has a chance of accustoming  himself to the unpleasant spectacle of torn flesh and bones.    This morning there was no lack of material, and many of the intestinal  wounds were peculiarly revolting, so that at lunch-time, when another  convenient lull in the torrent of shell fire enabled me to leave the  cellar, I felt thoroughly hardened; in fact I had assisted in a humble  degree at one or two operations.    I had lunch at the 11th Army Medical Headquarters Mess, and it was a  sumptuous meal to which I did full justice.    After lunch, whilst waiting to be motored to a field hospital, I  happened to see a battalion of Silesian troops about to go up to the  front line.    It was rather curious feeling that one was looking at men, each in  himself a unit of civilization, and yet many of whom were about to die  in the interests thereof.    Their faces were an interesting study.    Some looked careless and debonair, and seemed to swing past with a  touch of recklessness in their stride, others were grave and serious,  and seemed almost to plod forward to the dictates of an inevitable  fatalism.    The field hospital, where we met some very charming nurses, on one of  whom I think I created a distinct impression, was not particularly  interesting. It was clean, well-organized and radiated the efficiency  inseparable from the German Army.           *       *       *       *       *    Back at Wilhelmshaven--curse it!    Yesterday morning, when about to start on a tour of the ammunition  supply arrangements, I received an urgent wire recalling me at once!    There was nothing for it but to obey.    I was lucky enough to get a passage as far as Mons in an albatross  scout which was taking dispatches to that place.    From there I managed to bluff a motor car out of the town commandant--a  most obliging fellow. This took me to Aachen where I got an express.    The reason for my recall was that Witneisser went sick and Arnheim  being away, this has left only two in the operations ciphering  department.    My arrival has made us three. It is pretty strenuous work and, being of  a clerical nature, suits me little. The only consolation is that many  of the messages are most interesting. I was looking through the back  files the other day and amongst other interesting information I came  across the wireless report from the boat that had sunk the _Lusitania_.    It has always been a mystery to me why we sank her, as I do not believe  those things pay.           *       *       *       *       *    Arnheim has come back, so I have got out of the ciphering department,  to my great delight.    I have received official information that my application for U-boats  has been received. Meanwhile all there is to do is to sit at  this ---- hole and wait.          _2nd June_, 1916.      I have fought in the greatest sea battle of the ages; it has been a  wonderful and terrible experience.    All the details of the battle will be history, but I feel that I must  place on record my personal experiences.    We have not escaped without marks, and the good old _Koenig_ brought 67  dead and 125 wounded into port as the price of the victory off  Skajerack, but of the"]]]
