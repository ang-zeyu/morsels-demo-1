[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#2)"],[1,"another enemy on the field in the shape of a  huge milk-white bull with long horns: a very noble kind of animal, but  one which I always prefer to admire from behind a hedge, or at a  distance through a field-glass. Fortunately his wrathful mutterings gave  me timely notice of his approach, and without waiting to discover his  intentions, I incontinently fled down the slope to the refuge of a grove  or belt of trees clothing the lower portion of the hillside. Spent and  panting from my run, I embraced a big tree, and turning to face the foe,  found that I had not been followed: sheep, horses, and bull were all  grouped together just where I had left them, apparently holding a  consultation, or comparing notes.    The trees where I had sought shelter were old, and grew here and there,  singly or in scattered groups: it was a pretty wilderness of mingled  tree, shrub and flower. I was surprised to find here some very large and  ancient-looking fig-trees, and numbers of wasps and flies were busy  feeding on a few over-ripe figs on the higher branches. Honey-bees also  roamed about everywhere, extracting sweets from the autumn bloom, and  filling the sunny glades with a soft, monotonous murmur of sound.  Walking on full of happy thoughts and a keen sense of the sweetness of  life pervading me, I presently noticed that a multitude of small birds  were gathering about me, flitting through the trees overhead and the  bushes on either hand, but always keeping near me, apparently as much  excited at my presence as if I had been a gigantic owl, or some such  unnatural monster. Their increasing numbers and incessant excited  chirping and chattering at first served to amuse, but in the end began  to irritate me. I observed, too, that the alarm was spreading, and that  larger birds, usually shy of men--pigeons, jays, and magpies, I fancied  they were--now began to make their appearance. Could it be, thought I  with some concern, that I had wandered into some uninhabited wilderness,  to cause so great a commotion among the little feathered people? I very  soon dismissed this as an idle thought, for one does not find houses,  domestic animals, and fruit-trees in desert places. No, it was simply  the inherent cantankerousness of little birds which caused them to annoy  me. Looking about on the ground for something to throw at them, I found  in the grass a freshly-fallen walnut, and, breaking the shell, I quickly  ate the contents. Never had anything tasted so pleasant to me before!  But it had a curious effect on me, for, whereas before eating it I had  not felt hungry, I now seemed to be famishing, and began excitedly  searching about for more nuts. They were lying everywhere in the  greatest abundance; for, without knowing it, I had been walking through  a grove composed in large part of old walnut-trees. Nut after nut was  picked up and eagerly devoured, and I must have eaten four or five dozen  before my ravenous appetite was thoroughly appeased. During this feast I  had paid no attention to the birds, but when my hunger was over I began  again to feel annoyed at their trivial persecutions, and so continued to  gather the fallen nuts to throw at them. It amused and piqued me at the  same time to see how wide of the mark my missiles went. I could hardly  have hit a haystack at a distance of ten yards. After half an hour's  vigorous practice my right hand began to recover its lost cunning, and I  was at last greatly delighted when of my nuts went hissing like a bullet  through the leaves, not further than a yard from the wren, or whatever  the little beggar was, I had aimed at. Their Impertinences did not like  this at all; they began to find out that I was a rather dangerous person  to meddle with: their ranks were broken, they became demoralized and  scattered, in all directions, and I was finally left master of the  field.    \"Dolt that I am,\" I suddenly exclaimed, \"to be fooling away my time when  the nearest railway station or hotel is perhaps twenty miles away.\"    I hurried on, but when I got to the end of the grove, on the green sward  near some laurel and juniper bushes, I came on an excavation apparently  just made, the loose earth which had been dug out looking quite fresh  and moist. The hole or foss was narrow, about five feet deep and seven  feet long, and looked, I imagined, curiously like a grave. A few yards  away was a pile of dry brushwood, and some faggots bound together with  ropes of straw, all apparently freshly cut from the neighboring bushes.  As I stood there, wondering what these things meant, I happened to  glance away in the direction of the house where I intended to call,  which was not now visible owing to an intervening grove of tall trees,  and was surprised to discover a troop of about fifteen persons advancing  along the valley in my direction. Before them marched a tall  white-bearded old man; next came eight men, bearing a platform on their  shoulders with some heavy burden resting upon it; and behind these  followed the others. I began to think that they were actually carrying a  corpse, with the intention of giving it burial in that very pit beside  which I was standing; and, although it looked most unlike a funeral, for  no person in the procession wore black, the thought strengthened to a  conviction when I became able to distinguish a recumbent, human-like  form in a shroud-like covering on the platform. It seemed altogether a  very unusual proceeding, and made me feel extremely uncomfortable; so  much so that I considered it prudent to step back behind the bushes,  where I could watch the doings of the processionists without being  observed.    Led by the old man--who carried, suspended by thin chains, a large  bronze censer, or brazier rather, which sent out a thin continuous  wreath of smoke--they came straight on to the pit; and after depositing  their burden on the grass, remained standing for some minutes,  apparently to rest after their walk, all conversing together, but in  subdued tones, so that I could not catch their words, although standing  within fifteen yards of the grave. The uncoffined corpse, which seemed  that of a full-grown man, was covered with a white cloth, and rested on  a thick straw mat, provided with handles along the sides. On these  things, however, I bestowed but a hasty glance, so profoundly absorbed  had I become in watching the group of living human beings before me; for  they were certainly utterly unlike any fellow-creatures I had ever  encountered before. The old man was tall and spare, and from his  snowy-white majestic beard I took him to be about seventy years old; but  he was straight as an arrow, and his free movements and elastic tread  were those of a much younger man. His head was adorned with a dark red  skull-cap, and he wore a robe covering the whole body and reaching to  the ankles, of a deep yellow or rhubarb color; but his long wide sleeves  under his robe were dark red, embroidered with yellow flowers. The other  men had no covering on their heads, and their luxuriant hair, worn to  the shoulders, was, in most cases, very dark. Their garments were also  made in a different fashion, and consisted of a kilt-like dress, which  came half-way to the knees, a pale yellow shirt fitting tight to the  skin, and over it a loose sleeveless vest. The entire legs were cased in  stockings, curious in pattern and color. The women wore garments  resembling those of the men, but the tight-fitting sleeves reached only  half-way to the elbow, the rest of the arm being bare; and the  outergarment was all in one piece, resembling a long sleeveless jacket,  reaching below the hips. The color of their dresses varied, but in most  cases different shades of blue and subdued yellow predominated. In all,  the stockings showed deeper and richer shades of color than the other  garments; and in their curiously segmented appearance, and in the  harmonious arrangement of the tints, they seemed to represent the skins  of pythons and other beautifully variegated serpents. All wore low shoes  of an orange-brown color, fitting closely so as to display the shape of  the foot.    From the moment of first seeing them I had had no doubt about the sex of  the tall old leader of the procession, his shining white beard being as  conspicuous at a distance as a shield or a banner; but looking at the  others I was at first puzzled to know whether the party was composed of  men or women, or of both, so much did they resemble each other in  height, in their smooth faces, and in the length of their hair. On a  closer inspection I noticed the difference of dress of the sexes; also  that the men, if not sterner, had faces at all events less mild and soft  in expression than the women, and also a slight perceptible down on the  cheeks and upper lip.    After a first hasty survey of the group in general, I had eyes for only  one person in it--a fine graceful girl about fourteen years old, and the  youngest by far of the party. A description of this girl will give some  idea, albeit a very poor one, of the faces and general appearance of  this strange people I had stumbled on. Her dress, if a garment so brief  can be called a dress, showed a slaty-blue pattern on a straw-colored  ground, while her stockings were darker shades of the same colors. Her  eyes, at the distance I stood from her, appeared black, or nearly black,  but when seen closely they proved to be green--a wonderfully pure,  tender sea-green; and the others, I found, had eyes of the same hue. Her  hair fell to her shoulders; but it was very wavy or curly, and strayed  in small tendril-like tresses over her neck, forehead and cheeks; in  color it was golden black--that is, black in shade, but when touched  with sunlight every hair became a thread of shining red-gold; and in  some lights it looked like raven-black hair powdered with gold-dust. As  to her features, the forehead was broader and lower, the nose larger, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7413"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: Second series, XVIIIth to XIXth (#2)"],[1," the \"Arabian Nights,\" of  Ali Baba and the thieves.    It appears from the tale that the conference of Tahutia with the rebel  took place between the town and the Egyptian army, but near the town.  Then Tahutia proposes to go into the town as a pledge of his sincerity,  while the men of the town were to supply his troops with fodder. But he  appears to have remained talking with the rebel in the tent, until the  lucky chance of the stick turned up. This cleared the way for a neater  management of his plan, by enabling him to quietly make away with the  chief, without exciting his suspicions beforehand.    The name of the cane of the king is partly illegible; but we know how  many actual sticks and personal objects have their own names inscribed  on them. Nothing had a real entity to the Egyptian mind without an  individual name belonging to it.    The message sent by the charioteer presupposes that he was in the  secret; and he must therefore have been an Egyptian who had not heartily  joined in the rebellion. From the conclusion we see that the captives  taken as slaves to Egypt were by no means only prisoners of war, but  were the ordinary civil inhabitants of the conquered cities, \"them of  the city, both small and great.\"    The gold dish which the king gave to the tomb of Tahuti is so splendid  that it deserves some notice, especially as it has never been published  in England. It is circular, about seven inches across, with vertical  sides an inch high. The inside of the bottom bears a boss and rosette in  the centre, a line of swimming fish around that, and beyond all a chain  of lotus flowers. On the upright edge is an incised inscription, \"Given  in praise by the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, _Ra-men-kheper,_ to the  hereditary chief, the divine father, the beloved by God, filling the  heart of the king in all foreign lands and in the isles in the midst of  the great sea, filling stores with lazuli, electrum, and gold, keeper of  all foreign lands, keeper of the troops, praised by the good gold lord  of both lands and his _ka,--_the royal scribe Tahuti deceased.\" This  splendid piece of gold work was therefore given in honour of Tahuti at  his funeral, to be placed in his tomb for the use of his _ka._ The  weight of it is very nearly a troy pound, being 5,729 grains or four  utens. The allusion on it to the Mediterranean wars of Tahuti,  \"satisfying the king in all foreign lands and in the isles in the midst  of the great sea,\" is just in accord with this tale of the conquest of  Joppa.    Beside this golden bowl there are many other objects from Tahuti's tomb  which must have been very rich, and have escaped plundering until this  century. A silver dish, broken, and a canopic jar of alabaster, are in  Paris; another canopic jar, a palette, a kohl vase, and a heart scarab  set in gold, are in Leyden; while in Darmstadt is the dagger of this  great general. This piece of a popular tale founded on an incident of  his Syrian wars has curiously survived, while the more solid official  records of his conquests has perished in the wreck of history. His tomb  even is unknown, although it has been plundered; perhaps his active life  of foreign service did not give him that leisure to carve and decorate  it, which was so laboriously spent by the home-living dignitaries of  Thebes.          CLOSE OF THE XVIIIth DYNASTY    THE DOOMED PRINCE      There once was a king to whom no son was born; and his heart was  grieved, and he prayed for himself unto the gods around him for a child.  They decreed that one should be born to him. And his wife, after her  time was fulfilled, brought forth a son. Then came the Hathors to decree  for him a destiny; they said, \"His death is to be by the crocodile, or  by the serpent, or by the dog.\" Then the people who stood by heard this,  and they went to tell it to his majesty. Then his majesty's heart  sickened very greatly. And his majesty caused a house to be built upon  the desert; it was furnished with people and with all good things of the  royal house, that the child should not go abroad. And when the child was  grown, he went up upon the roof, and he saw a dog; it was following a  man who was walking on the road. He spoke to his page, who was with him,  \"What is this that walks behind the man who is coming along the road?\"  He answered him, \"This is a dog.\" The child said to him, \"Let there be  brought to me one like it.\" The page went to repeat it to his majesty.  And his majesty said, \"Let there be brought to him a little pet dog,  lest his heart be sad.\" And behold they brought to him the dog.    Then when the days increased after this, and when the child became grown  in all his limbs, he sent a message to his father saying, \"Come,  wherefore am I kept here? Inasmuch as I am fated to three evil fates,  let me follow my desire. Let God do what is in His heart.\" They agreed  to all he said, and gave him all sorts of arms, and also his dog to  follow him, and they took him to the east country, and said to him,  \"Behold, go thou whither thou wilt.\" His dog was with him, and he went  northward, following his heart in the desert, while he lived on all the  best of the game of the desert. He went to the chief of Naha-raina.    And behold there had not been any born to the chief of Naharaina, except  one daughter. Behold, there had been built for her a house; its seventy  windows were seventy cubits from the ground. And the chief caused to be  brought all the sons of the chiefs of the land of Khalu, and said to  them, \"He who reaches the window of my daughter, she shall be to him for  a wife.\"    And many days after these things, as they were in their daily task, the  youth rode by the place where they were. They took the youth to their  house, they bathed him, they gave provender to his horses, they brought  all kinds of things for the youth, they perfumed him, they anointed his  feet, they gave him portions of their own food; and they spake to him,  \"Whence comest thou, goodly youth?\" He said to them, \"I am son of an  officer of the land of Egypt; my mother is dead, and my father has taken  another wife. And when she bore children, she grew to hate me, and I  have come as a fugitive from before her.\" And they embraced him, and  kissed him.    And after many days were passed, he said to the youths, \"What is it that  ye do here?\" And they said to him, \"We spend our time in this: we climb  up, and he who shall reach the window of the daughter of the chief of  Naharaina, to him will he given her to wife.\" He said to them, \"If it  please you, let me behold the matter, that I may come to climb with  you.\" They went to climb, as was their daily wont: and the youth stood  afar off to behold; and the face of the daughter of the chief of  Naharaina was turned to them. And another day the sons came to climb,  and the youth came to climb with the sons of the chiefs. He climbed, and  he reached the window of the daughter of the chief of Naharaina. She  kissed him, she embraced him in all his limbs.    And one went to rejoice the heart of her father, and said to him, \"One  of the people has reached the window of thy daughter.\" And the prince  inquired of the messenger, saying, \"The son of which of the princes is  it?\" And he replied to him, \"It is the son of an officer, who has come  as a fugitive from the land of Egypt, fleeing from before his stepmother  when she had children.\" Then the chief of Naharaina was exceeding angry;  and he said, \"Shall I indeed give my daughter to the Egyptian fugitive?  Let him go back whence he came.\" And one came to tell the youth, \"Go  back to the place thou earnest from.\" But the maiden seized his hand;  she swore an oath by God, saying, \"By the being of Ra Harakhti, if one  takes him from me, I will not eat, I will not drink, I shall die in that  same hour.\" The messenger went to tell unto her father all that she  said. Then the prince sent men to slay the youth, while he was in his  house. But the maiden said, \"By the being of Ra, if one slay him I shall  be dead ere the sun goeth down. I will not pass an hour of life if I am  parted from him.\" And one went to tell her father. Then the prince made  them bring the youth with the maiden. The youth was seized with fear  when he came before the prince. But he embraced him, he kissed him all  over, and said, \"Oh! tell me who thou art; behold, thou art to me as a  son.\" He said to him, \"I am a son of an officer of the land of Egypt; my  mother died, my father took to him a second wife; she came to hate me,  and I fled a fugitive from before her.\" He then gave to him his daughter  to wife; he gave also to him a house, and serfs, and fields, also cattle  and all manner of good things.    But after the days of these things were passed, the youth said to his  wife, \"I am doomed to three fates--a crocodile, a serpent, and a dog.\"  She said to him, \"Let one kill the dog which belongs to thee.\" He  replied to her, \"I am not going to kill my dog, which I have brought up  from when it was small.\" And she feared greatly for her husband, and  would not let him go alone abroad.    And one went with the youth toward the land of Egypt, to travel in that  country. Behold the crocodile of the river, he came out by the town in  which the youth was. And in that town was a mighty man. And the mighty  man would not suffer the crocodile to escape. And when the crocodile was  bound, the mighty man went out and walked abroad. And when the sun rose  the mighty man went back to the house; and he did so every day, during  two months of days.    Now when the days passed after this, the youth sat making a good day in  his house.    And when the evening came he lay down on his bed, sleep seized upon his  limbs; and his wife filled a bowl of milk, and placed it by his side.  Then came out a serpent from his hole, to bite the youth; behold his wife  was sitting by him, she lay not down. Thereupon the servants gave milk  to the serpent,"]]]
