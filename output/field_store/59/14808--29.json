I  don't see but I've got to take care of ye. 'Sposin' we marry!\"    Mag raised her eyes, full of amazement, and uttered a sonorous \"What?\"    Jim felt abashed for a moment. He knew well what were her objections.    \"You's had trial of white folks any how. They run off and left ye, and  now none of 'em come near ye to see if you's dead or alive. I's black  outside, I know, but I's got a white heart inside. Which you rather  have, a black heart in a white skin, or a white heart in a black one?\"    \"Oh, dear!\" sighed Mag; \"Nobody on earth cares for ME--\"    \"I do,\" interrupted Jim.    \"I can do but two things,\" said she, \"beg my living, or get it from  you.\"    \"Take me, Mag. I can give you a better home than this, and not let you  suffer so.\"    He prevailed; they married. You can philosophize, gentle reader, upon  the impropriety of such unions, and preach dozens of sermons on the  evils of amalgamation. Want is a more powerful philosopher and preacher.  Poor Mag. She has sundered another bond which held her to her fellows.  She has descended another step down the ladder of infamy.          CHAPTER II.    MY FATHER'S DEATH.        Misery! we have known each other,      Like a sister and a brother,      Living in the same lone home      Many years--we must live some      Hours or ages yet to come.        SHELLEY.          JIM, proud of his treasure,--a white wife,--tried hard to fulfil his  promises; and furnished her with a more comfortable dwelling, diet, and  apparel. It was comparatively a comfortable winter she passed after her  marriage. When Jim could work, all went on well. Industrious, and fond  of Mag, he was determined she should not regret her union to him. Time  levied an additional charge upon him, in the form of two pretty  mulattos, whose infantile pranks amply repaid the additional toil. A few  years, and a severe cough and pain in his side compelled him to be an  idler for weeks together, and Mag had thus a reminder of by-gones. She  cared for him only as a means to subserve her own comfort; yet she  nursed him faithfully and true to marriage vows till death released her.  He became the victim of consumption. He loved Mag to the last. So long  as life continued, he stifled his sensibility to pain, and toiled for  her sustenance long after he was able to do so.    A few expressive wishes for her welfare; a hope of better days for her;  an anxiety lest they should not all go to the \"good place;\" brief advice  about their children; a hope expressed that Mag would not be neglected  as she used to be; the manifestation of Christian patience; these were  ALL the legacy of miserable Mag. A feeling of cold desolation came over  her, as she turned from the grave of one who had been truly faithful to  her.    She was now expelled from companionship with white people; this last  step--her union with a black--was the climax of repulsion.    Seth Shipley, a partner in Jim's business, wished her to remain in her  present home; but she declined, and returned to her hovel again, with  obstacles threefold more insurmountable than before. Seth accompanied  her, giving her a weekly allowance which furnished most of the food  necessary for the four inmates. After a time, work failed; their means  were reduced.    How Mag toiled and suffered, yielding to fits of desperation, bursts of  anger, and uttering curses too fearful to repeat. When both were  supplied with work, they prospered; if idle, they were hungry together.  In this way their interests became united; they planned for the future  together. Mag had lived an outcast for years. She had ceased to feel the  gushings of penitence; she had crushed the sharp agonies of an awakened  conscience. She had no longings for a purer heart, a better life. Far  easier to descend lower. She entered the darkness of perpetual infamy.  She asked not the rite of civilization or Christianity. Her will made  her the wife of Seth. Soon followed scenes familiar and trying.    \"It's no use,\" said Seth one day; \"we must give the children away, and  try to get work in some other place.\"    \"Who'll take the black devils?\" snarled Mag.    \"They're none of mine,\" said Seth; \"what you growling about?\"    \"Nobody will want any thing of mine, or yours either,\" she replied.    \"We'll make 'em, p'r'aps,\" he said. \"There's Frado's six years old, and  pretty, if she is yours, and white folks'll say so. She'd be a prize  somewhere,\" he continued, tipping his chair back against the wall, and  placing his feet upon the rounds, as if he had much more to say when in  the right position.    Frado, as they called one of Mag's children, was a beautiful mulatto,  with long, curly black hair, and handsome, roguish eyes, sparkling with  an exuberance of spirit almost beyond restraint.    Hearing her name mentioned, she looked up from her play, to see what  Seth had to say of her.    \"Wouldn't the Bellmonts take her?\" asked Seth.    \"Bellmonts?\" shouted Mag. \"His wife is a right she-devil! and if--\"    \"Hadn't they better be all together?\" interrupted Seth, reminding her of  a like epithet used in reference to her little ones.    Without seeming to notice him, she continued, \"She can't keep a girl in  the house over a week; and Mr. Bellmont wants to hire a boy to work for  him, but he can't find one that will live in the house with her; she's  so ugly, they can't.\"    \"Well, we've got to make a move soon,\" answered Seth; \"if you go with  me, we shall go right off. Had you rather spare the other one?\" asked  Seth, after a short pause.    \"One's as bad as t'other,\" replied Mag. \"Frado is such a wild, frolicky  thing, and means to do jest as she's a mind to; she won't go if she  don't want to. I don't want to tell her she is to be given away.\"    \"I will,\" said Seth. \"Come here, Frado?\"    The child seemed to have some dim foreshadowing of evil, and declined.    \"Come here,\" he continued; \"I want to tell you something.\"    She came reluctantly. He took her hand and said: \"We're going to move,  by-'m-bye; will you go?\"    \"No!\" screamed she; and giving a sudden jerk which destroyed Seth's  equilibrium, left him sprawling on the floor, while she escaped through  the open door.    \"She's a hard one,\" said Seth, brushing his patched coat sleeve. \"I'd  risk her at Bellmont's.\"    They discussed the expediency of a speedy departure. Seth would first  seek employment, and then return for Mag. They would take with them what  they could carry, and leave the rest with Pete Greene, and come for them  when they were wanted. They were long in arranging affairs  satisfactorily, and were not a little startled at the close of their  conference to find Frado missing. They thought approaching night would  bring her. Twilight passed into darkness, and she did not come. They  thought she had understood their plans, and had, perhaps, permanently  withdrawn. They could not rest without making some effort to ascertain  her retreat. Seth went in pursuit, and returned without her. They  rallied others when they discovered that another little colored girl was  missing, a favorite playmate of Frado's. All effort proved unavailing.  Mag felt sure her fears were realized, and that she might never see her  again. Before her anxieties became realities, both were safely returned,  and from them and their attendant they learned that they went to walk,  and not minding the direction soon found themselves lost. They had  climbed fences and walls, passed through thickets and marshes, and when  night approached selected a thick cluster of shrubbery as a covert for  the night. They were discovered by the person who now restored them,  chatting of their prospects, Frado attempting to banish the childish  fears of her companion. As they were some miles from home, they were  kindly cared for until morning. Mag was relieved to know her child was  not driven to desperation by their intentions to relieve themselves of  her, and she was inclined to think severe restraint would be healthful.    The removal was all arranged; the few days necessary for such migrations  passed quickly, and one bright summer morning they bade farewell to  their Singleton hovel, and with budgets and bundles commenced their  weary march. As they neared the village, they heard the merry shouts of  children gathered around the school-room, awaiting the coming of their  teacher.    \"Halloo!\" screamed one, \"Black, white and yeller!\" \"Black, white and  yeller,\" echoed a dozen voices.    It did not grate so harshly on poor Mag as once it would. She did not  even turn her head to look at them. She had passed into an insensibility  no childish taunt could penetrate, else she would have reproached  herself as she passed familiar scenes, for extending the separation once  so easily annihilated by steadfast integrity. Two miles beyond lived the  Bellmonts, in a large, old fashioned, two-story white house, environed  by fruitful acres, and embellished by shrubbery and shade trees. Years  ago a youthful couple consecrated it as home; and after many little feet  had worn paths to favorite fruit trees, and over its green hills, and  mingled at last with brother man in the race which belongs neither to  the swift or strong, the sire became grey-haired and decrepit, and went  to his last repose. His aged consort soon followed him. The old  homestead thus passed into the hands of a son, to whose wife Mag had  applied the epithet \"she-devil,\" as may be remembered. John, the son,  had not in his family arrangements departed from the example of the  father. The pastimes of his boyhood were ever freshly revived by  witnessing the games of his own sons as they rallied about the same goal  his youthful feet had often won; as well as by the amusements of his  daughters in their imitations of maternal duties.    At the time we introduce them, however,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5844"],[0,"The Adventures of Johnny Chuck (#2)"],[1,"ing! Spring! Spring! Spring!       Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Spring!\"    When Johnny Chuck had first heard them, he had looked in all the  tree-tops for the singers, but not one could he see. Then he had thought  that they must be hidden in the bushes; but when he went to look, he  found that the sweet singers were not there. It was very mysterious.  Finally he asked Peter Rabbit if he knew who the sweet singers were and  where they were. Peter didn't know, but he was willing to try to find  out. Peter is always willing to try to find out about things he doesn't  already know about. So Johnny Chuck and Peter Rabbit started out to find  the sweet singers.    \"I believe they are down in the old bulrushes around the Smiling Pool,\"  said Peter Rabbit, as he stood listening with a hand behind one long  ear.    So over to the Smiling Pool they hurried. The nearer they got, the  louder became the voices singing:        \"Spring! Spring! Spring! Spring!       Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Spring!\"    But look as they would, they couldn't see a single singer among the  brown bulrushes. It was very strange, very strange indeed! It seemed as  if the voices came right out of the Smiling Pool itself!    When Peter Rabbit made a little noise, as he hopped out on the bank  where he could look all over the Smiling Pool, the singing stopped.  After he had sat perfectly still for a little while, it began again.  There was no doubt about it this time; those voices came right out of  the water.    Johnny Chuck stared at Peter Rabbit, and Peter stared at Johnny Chuck.  Nobody was to be seen in the Smiling Pool, and yet there were those  voices--oh, so many of them--coming right out of the water.    \"How can birds stay under water and still sing?\" asked Johnny Chuck.    \"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!\"    Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck whirled around, to find Jerry Muskrat  peeping up at them from a hole in the bank almost under their feet.    {Illustration: \"Ho, ho, ho! That's the best joke this spring!\" shouted  Jerry Muskrat.}    \"Ho, ho, ho! That's the best joke this spring!\" shouted Jerry Muskrat,  and laughed until he had to hold his sides. \"Birds under water! Ho, ho,  ho!\"          IV. JOHNNY CHUCK FINDS OUT WHO THE SWEET SINGERS ARE      Johnny Chuck couldn't keep away from the Smiling Pool. No, Sir, Johnny  Chuck couldn't keep away from the Smiling Pool. Ever since he and Peter  Rabbit had gone over there looking for the sweet singers, who every  night and part of the day told all who would listen how glad they were  that Mistress Spring had come to the Green Meadows and the Green Forest,  Johnny Chuck had had something on his mind. And this is why he couldn't  keep away from the Smiling Pool.    You see it was this way: Johnny and Peter had thought that of course the  sweet singers were birds. They hadn't dreamed of anything else. So of  course they went looking for birds. When they reached the Smiling Pool,  the voices came right out of the water. Johnny knew that some birds,  like many of the cousins of Mrs. Quack, can stay under water a long  time, and so he didn't know but some other birds might.    Jerry Muskrat was always watching for Johnny, whenever he came to the  Smiling Pool, and his eyes would twinkle as he would gravely say:    \"Hello, Johnny Chuck! Have you seen the birds sing under water yet?\"    Johnny would smile good-naturedly and reply: \"Not yet, Jerry Muskrat.  Won't you point them out to me?\"    Then Jerry would reply:        \"Two eyes you have, bright as can be;       Perhaps some day you'll learn to see.\"    Then Johnny Chuck would sit as still as ever he knew how, and watch and  watch the Smiling Pool, but not a bird did he see in the water, though  the singers were still there. One day a sudden thought popped into his  head. Perhaps those singers were not birds at all! Why hadn't he thought  of that before? Perhaps it was because he was looking so hard for  birds that he hadn't seen anything else. Johnny began to look, not for  anything in particular, but to see everything that he could.    Almost right away he saw some tiny little dark spots on the water. They  didn't look like much of anything. They were so small that he hadn't  noticed them before. One of them was quite close to him, and as Johnny  Chuck looked at it, it began to look like a tiny nose, and then--why,  just then, Johnny was very sure that one of those singing voices came  right from that very spot!    He was so surprised that he hopped to his feet and excitedly beckoned  to Jerry Muskrat. The instant he did that, the voices near him stopped  singing, and the little spots on the water disappeared, leaving just the  tiniest of little rings, just such tiny little rings as drops of rain  falling on the Smiling Pool would make. And when that tiny spot nearest  to him that looked like a tiny nose disappeared, Johnny Chuck caught  just a glimpse of a little form under the water.    \"Why--why-e-e! The singers are Grandfather Frog's children!\" cried  Johnny Chuck.    \"No, they're not, but they are own cousins to them; they are the  grandchildren of old Mr. Tree Toad! and they are called Hylas!\" said  Jerry Muskrat, laughing and rubbing his hands in great glee. \"I told you  that if you used your eyes, you'd learn to see.\"    \"My, but they've got voices bigger than they are!\" said Johnny Chuck,  as he started home across the Green Meadows. \"I'm glad I know who the  singers of the Smiling Pool are, and I mustn't forget their name--Hylas.  What a funny name!\" But Farmer Brown's boy, listening to their song that  evening, didn't call them Hylas. He said: \"Hear the peepers! Spring is  surely here.\"          V. JOHNNY CHUCK BECOMES DISSATISFIED      Johnny Chuck was unhappy. Here it was the glad springtime, when  everybody is supposed to be the very happiest, and Johnny Chuck was  unhappy. Why was he unhappy? Well, he hardly knew himself. He had slept  comfortably all the long winter. He had awakened very, very hungry, but  now he had plenty to eat. All about him the birds were singing or busily  at work building new homes. And still Johnny Chuck felt unhappy. It was  dreadful to feel this way and not have any good reason for it.    One bright morning Johnny Chuck sat on his door-step watching Drummer  the Woodpecker building a new home in the old apple-tree. Drummer's red  head flew back and forth, back and forth, and his sharp bill cut out  tiny bits of wood. It was slow work; it was hard work. But Drummer  seemed happy, very happy indeed. It was watching Drummer that started  Johnny Chuck to thinking about his own home. He had always thought it a  very nice home. He had built it just as he wanted it. From the doorstep  he could look in all directions over the Green Meadows. It had a front  door and a hidden back door. Yes, it was a very nice home indeed.    But now, all of a sudden, Johnny Chuck became dissatisfied with his  home. It was too near the Lone Little Path. Too many people knew where  it was. It wasn't big enough. The front door ought to face the other  way. Dear me, what a surprising lot of faults a discontented heart can  find with things that have always been just right! It was so with Johnny  Chuck. That house in which he had spent so many happy days, which had  protected him from all harm, of which he had been so proud when he first  built it, was now the meanest house in the world. If other people had  new houses, why shouldn't he? The more he thought about it, the more  dissatisfied and discontented he became and of course the more unhappy.  You know one cannot be dissatisfied and discontented and happy at the  same time.    Now dissatisfied and discontented people are not at all pleasant to have  around. Johnny Chuck had always been one of the best natured of all the  little meadow people, and everybody liked him. So Jimmy Skunk didn't  know quite what to make of it, when he came down the Lone Little Path  and found Johnny Chuck so out of sorts that he wouldn't even answer when  spoken to.    Jimmy Skunk was feeling very good-natured himself. He had just had a  fine breakfast of fat beetles and he was at peace with all the world.  So he sat down beside Johnny Chuck and began to talk, just as if Johnny  Chuck was his usual good-natured self.    \"It's a fine day,\" said Jimmy Skunk.    Johnny Chuck just sniffed.    \"You're looking very fine,\" said Jimmy.    Johnny just scowled.    \"I think you've got the best place on the Green Meadows for a house,\"  said Jimmy, pretending to admire the view.    Johnny scowled harder than ever.    \"And such a splendid house!\" said Jimmy. \"I wish I had one like it.\"    \"I'm glad you like it! You can have the old thing!\" snapped Johnny  Chuck.    \"What's that?\" demanded Jimmy Skunk, opening his eyes very wide.    \"I said that you can have it. I'm going to move,\" replied Johnny Chuck.    Now he really hadn't thought of moving until that very minute. And he  didn't know why he had said it. But he had said it, and because he is an  obstinate little fellow he stuck to it.    \"When can I move in?\" asked Jimmy Skunk, his eyes twinkling.    \"Right away, if you want to,\" replied Johnny Chuck, and swaggered off  down the Lone Little Path, leaving Jimmy Skunk to stare after him as if  he thought Johnny Chuck had suddenly gone crazy, as indeed he did.          VI. JOHNNY CHUCK TURNS TRAMP      Johnny Chuck had turned tramp. Yes, Sir, Johnny Chuck had turned tramp.  It was a funny thing to do, but he had done it. He didn't know why he  had done it, excepting that he had become dissatisfied and discontented  and unhappy in his old home. And then, almost without thinking what he  was doing, he had told Jimmy Skunk that he could have the house he had  worked so hard to build the summer before and of which he had been so  proud. Then Johnny Chuck had swaggered away down the Lone Little Path  without once looking back at the home he was leaving.    Where was he going? Well, to tell the truth, Johnny didn't"]]]
