In an epitaph, of which the  following couplet may serve as a translation, his life was represented  as incompatible with the existence of the human race:--        \"Here lies Robespierre--let no tear be shed;      Reader, if he had lived, thou hadst been dead.\"    The commencement of the third volume introduces us to the family of  Bonaparte, who resided in the island of Corsica, which was, in ancient  times, remarkable as the scene of Seneca's exile, and in the last  century was distinguished by the memorable stand which the natives made  in defence of their liberties against the Genoese and French, during a  war which tended to show the high and indomitable spirit of the  islanders, united as it is with the fiery and vindictive feelings proper  to their country and climate.      BIRTH OF BONAPARTE.    Charles Bonaparte, the father of Napoleon, died at the age of about  forty years, of an ulcer in the stomach, on the 24th of February, 1785.  His celebrated son fell a victim to the same disease. During Napoleon's  grandeur, the community of Montpellier expressed a desire to erect a  monument to the memory of Charles Bonaparte. His answer was both  sensible and in good taste. \"Had I lost my father yesterday,\" he said,  \"it would be natural to pay his memory some mark of respect consistent  with my present situation. But it is twenty years since the event, and  it is one in which the public can take no concern. Let us leave the dead  in peace.\"    The subject of our narrative was born, according to the best accounts,  and his own belief, upon the 15th day of August, 1769, at his father's  house in Ajaccio, forming one side of a court which leads out of the Rue  Charles.[3] We read with interest, that his mother's good constitution,  and bold character of mind, having induced her to attend mass upon the  day of his birth, (being the Festival of the Assumption,) she was  obliged to return home immediately, and as there was no time to prepare  a bed or bedroom, she was delivered of the future victor upon a  temporary couch prepared for her accommodation, and covered with an  ancient piece of tapestry, representing the heroes of the Iliad. The  infant was christened by the name of Napoleon, an obscure saint, who had  dropped to leeward, and fallen altogether out of the calendar, so that  his namesake never knew which day he was to celebrate as the festival of  his patron. When questioned, on this subject by the bishop who  confirmed him, he answered smartly, that there were a great many saints,  and only three hundred and sixty-five days to divide amongst them. The  politeness of the pope promoted the patron in order to compliment the  god-child, and Saint Napoleon des Ursins was accommodated with a  festival. To render this compliment, which no one but a pope could have  paid, still more flattering, the feast of Saint Napoleon was fixed for  the fifteenth August, the birthday of the emperor, and the day on which  he signed the Concordat. So that Napoleon had the rare honour of  promoting his patron saint.        [3] Benson's \"Sketches of Corsica,\" p. 4.      NAPOLEON'S EARLY LIFE.    The young Napoleon had, of course, the simple and hardy education proper  to the natives of the mountainous island of his birth, and in his  infancy was not remarkable for more than that animation of temper, and  wilfulness and impatience of inactivity, by which children of quick  parts and lively sensibility are usually distinguished. The winter of  the year was generally passed by the family of his father at Ajaccio,  where they still preserve and exhibit, as the ominous play-thing of  Napoleon's boyhood, the model of a brass cannon, weighing about thirty  pounds.[4] We leave it to philosophers to inquire, whether the future  love of war was suggested by the accidental possession of such a toy; or  whether the tendency of the mind dictated the selection of it; or,  lastly, whether the nature of the pastime, corresponding with the taste  which chose it, may not have had each their action and reaction, and  contributed between them to the formation of a character so warlike.        [4] \"Sketches of Corsica,\" p. 4.    The same traveller who furnishes the above anecdote, gives an  interesting account of the country retreat of the family of Bonaparte  during the summer.    Going along the sea-shore from Ajaccio towards the Isle Sanguiniere,  about a mile from the town, occur two stone pillars, the remains of a  doorway, leading up to a dilapidated villa, once the residence of Madame  Bonaparte's half-brother on the mother's side, whom Napoleon created  Cardinal Fesch.[5] The house is approached by an avenue, surrounded and  overhung by the cactus and other shrubs, which luxuriate in a warm  climate. It has a garden and a lawn, showing amidst neglect vestiges of  their former beauty, and the house is surrounded by shrubberies,  permitted to run to wilderness. This was the summer residence of Madame  Bonaparte and her family. Almost enclosed by the wild olive, the cactus,  the clematis, and the almond-tree, is a very singular and isolated  granite rock, called Napoleon's grotto, which seems to have resisted the  decomposition which has taken place around. The remains of a small  summer-house are visible beneath the rock, the entrance to which is  nearly closed by a luxuriant fig-tree. This was Bonaparte's frequent  retreat, when the vacations of the school at which he studied permitted  him to visit home. How the imagination labours to form an idea of the  visions, which, in this sequestered and romantic spot, must have arisen  before the eyes of the future hero of a hundred battles!        [5] The mother of Letitia Ramolini, wife of Carlo Bonaparte,      married a Swiss officer in the French service, named Fesch,      after the death of Letitia's father.    Bonaparte's ardour for the abstract sciences amounted to a passion, and  was combined with a singular aptitude for applying them to the purposes  of war, while his attention to pursuits so interesting and exhaustless  in themselves, was stimulated by his natural ambition and desire of  distinction. Almost all the scientific teachers at Brienne, being  accustomed to study the character of their pupils, and obliged by their  duty to make memoranda and occasional reports on the subject, spoke of  the talents of Bonaparte, and the progress of his studies, with  admiration. Circumstances of various kinds, exaggerated or invented,  have been circulated concerning the youth of a person so remarkable. The  following are given upon good authority.[6]        [6] They were many years since communicated to the author by      Messrs. Joseph and Louis Law, brothers of General Baron      Lauriston, Bonaparte's favourite aid-de-camp. These gentlemen,      or at least Joseph, were educated at Brienne, but at a later      period than Napoleon. Their distinguished brother was his      contemporary.    The conduct of Napoleon among his companions was that of a studious and  reserved youth, addicting himself deeply to the means of improvement,  and rather avoiding than seeking the usual temptations to dissipation of  time. He had few friends, and no intimates; yet at different times, when  he chose to exert it, he exhibited considerable influence over his  fellow-students, and when there was any joint plan to be carried into  effect, he was frequently chosen dictator of the little republic.    In the time of winter, Bonaparte, upon one occasion, engaged his  companions in constructing a fortress out of the snow, regularly  defended by ditches and bastions, according to the rules of  fortification. It was considered as displaying the great powers of the  juvenile engineer in the way of his profession, and was attacked and  defended by the students, who divided into parties for the purpose,  until the battle became so keen that their superiors thought it proper  to proclaim a truce.    The young Bonaparte gave another instance of address and enterprise upon  the following occasion. There was a fair held annually in the  neighbourhood of Brienne, where the pupils of the Military School used  to find a day's amusement; but on account of a quarrel betwixt them and  the country people upon a former occasion, or for some such cause, the  masters of the institution had directed that the students should not on  the fair-day be permitted to go beyond their own precincts, which were  surrounded with a wall. Under the direction of the young Corsican,  however, the scholars had already laid a plot for securing their usual  day's diversion. They had undermined the wall which encompassed their  exercising ground, with so much skill and secrecy, that their operations  remained entirely unknown till the morning of the fair, when a part of  the boundary unexpectedly fell, and gave a free passage to the  imprisoned students, of which they immediately took the advantage, by  hurrying to the prohibited scene of amusement.    But although on these, and perhaps other occasions, Bonaparte displayed  some of the frolic temper of youth, mixed with the inventive genius and  the talent for commanding others by which he was distinguished in after  time, his life at school was in general that of a recluse and severe  student, acquiring by his judgment, and treasuring in his memory, that  wonderful process of almost unlimited combination, by means of which he  was afterwards able to simplify the most difficult and complicated  undertakings. His mathematical teacher was proud of the young islander,  as the boast of his school, and his other scientific instructors had the  same reason to be satisfied.    In languages Bonaparte was less a proficient, and never acquired the art  of writing or spelling French, far less foreign languages, with accuracy  or correctness; nor had the monks of Brienne any reason to pride  themselves on the classical proficiency of their scholar.

He met some devils.  \"What are you running from?\" asked they. \"From a wicked woman,\" he  answered. The devils turned and ran away with him.    One rather longer story may be summarized thus: Satan, disguised in human  shape, met a fugitive husband, who had left his wicked wife. Satan told him  that he was in similar case, and proposed a compact. Satan would enter into  the bodies of men, and the other, pretending to be a skilful physician,  would exorcise Satan. They would share the profits. Satan begins on the  king, and the queen engages the confederate to cure the king within three  days, for a large fee, but in case of failure the doctor is to die. Satan  refuses to come out: his real plan is to get the doctor killed in this way.  The doctor obtains a respite, and collects a large body of musicians, who  make a tremendous din. Satan trembles. \"What is that noise?\" he asks. \"Your  wife is coming,\" says the doctor. Out sprang Satan and fled to the end of  the earth.    These tales and quips, it is true, are directed against \"wicked\" women, but  if Zabara really wrote them, it would be difficult to acquit him of  woman-hatred, unless the stories have been misplaced, and should appear, as  part of the \"Book of Delight,\" within the Leopard section, which rounds off  a series of unfriendly tales with a moral friendly to woman. In general,  Oriental satire directed against women must not be taken too seriously. As  Guedemann has shown, the very Jews that wrote most bitterly of women were  loud in praise of their own wives--the women whom alone they knew  intimately. Woman was the standing butt for men to hurl their darts at, and  one cannot help feeling that a good deal of the fun got its point from the  knowledge that the charges were exaggerated or untrue. You find the Jewish  satirists exhausting all their stores of drollery on the subject of  rollicking drunkenness. They roar till their sides creak over the humor of  the wine-bibber. They laugh at him and with him. They turn again and again  to the subject, which shares the empire with women in the Jewish poets. Yet  we know well enough that the writers of these Hebrew Anacreontic lyrics  were sober men, who rarely indulged in overmuch strong drink. In short, the  medieval Jewish satirists were gifted with much of what a little time ago  was foolishly styled \"the new humor.\" Joseph Zabara was a \"new\" humorist.  He has the quaint subtlety of the author of the \"Ingoldsby Legends,\" and  revelled in the exaggeration of trifles that is the stock-in-trade of the  modern funny man. Woman plays the part with the former that the  mother-in-law played a generation ago with the latter. In Zabara, again,  there is a good deal of mere rudeness, which the author seems to mistake  for cutting repartee. This, I take it, is another characteristic of the  so-called new humor.    The probable explanation of the marked divergence between Zabara's stories  and the moral he draws from them lies, however, a little deeper. The  stories themselves are probably Indian in origin; hence they are marked by  the tone hostile to woman so characteristic of Indian folk-lore. On the  other hand, if Zabara himself was a friendly critic of woman, his own  moralizings in her favor are explained. This theory is not entirely upset  by the presence even of the additional stories, for these, too, are  translations, and Zabara cannot be held responsible for their contents. The  selection of good anecdotes was restricted in his day within very narrow  limits.    Yet Zabara's reading must have been extensive. He knew something of  astronomy, philosophy, the science of physiognomy, music, mathematics, and  physics, and a good deal of medicine. He was familiar with Arabian  collections of proverbs and tales, for he informs his readers several times  that he is drawing on Arabic sources. He knew the \"Choice of Pearls,\" the  Midrashic \"Stories of King Solomon,\" the \"Maxims of the Philosophers,\" the  \"Proverbs of the Wise\"; but not \"Sendabar\" in its Hebrew form. His  acquaintance with the language of the Bible was thorough; but he makes one  or two blunders in quoting the substance of Scriptural passages. Though he  disclaimed the title of a Talmudic scholar, he was not ignorant of the  Rabbinic literature. Everyone quotes it: the fox, the woman, Enan, and the  author. He was sufficiently at home in this literature to pun therein. He  also knew the story of Tobit, but, as he introduces it as \"a most  marvellous tale,\" it is clear that this book of the Apocrypha was not  widely current in his day. The story, as Zabara tells it, differs  considerably from the Apocryphal version of it. The incidents are  misplaced, the story of the betrothal is disconnected from that of the  recovery of the money by Tobit, and the detail of the gallows occurs in no  other known text of the story. In one point, Zabara's version strikingly  agrees with the Hebrew and Chaldee texts of Tobit as against the Greek;  Tobit's son is not accompanied by a dog on his journey to recover his  father's long-lost treasure.    One of the tales told by Zabara seems to imply a phenomenon of the  existence of which there is no other evidence. There seems to have been in  Spain a small class of Jews that were secret converts to Christianity. They  passed openly for Jews, but were in truth Christians. The motive for the  concealment is unexplained, and the whole passage may be merely satirical.    It remains for me to describe the texts now extant of the \"Book of  Delight.\" In 1865 the \"Book of Delight\" appeared, from a fifteenth century  manuscript in Paris, in the second volume of a Hebrew periodical called the  _Lebanon_. In the following year the late Senior Sachs wrote an  introduction to it and to two other publications, which were afterwards  issued together under the title _Yen Lebanon_ (Paris, 1866). The editor was  aware of the existence of another text, but, strange to tell, he did not  perceive the need of examining it. Had he done this, his edition would have  been greatly improved. For the Bodleian Library possesses a copy of another  edition of the \"Book of Delight,\" undated, and without place of issue, but  printed in Constantinople, in 1577. One or two other copies of this edition  are extant elsewhere. The editor was Isaac Akrish, as we gather from a  marginal note to the version of Tobit given by Joseph Zabara. This Isaac  Akrish was a travelling bookseller, who printed interesting little books,  and hawked them about. Dr. Steinschneider points out that the date of Isaac  Akrish's edition can be approximately fixed by the type. The type is that  of the Jaabez Press, established in Constantinople and Salonica in 1560.  This Constantinople edition is not only longer than the Paris edition, it  is, on the whole, more accurate. The verbal variations between the two  editions are extremely numerous, but the greater accuracy of the  Constantinople edition shows itself in many ways. The rhymes are much  better preserved, though the Paris edition is occasionally superior in this  respect. But many passages that are quite unintelligible in the Paris  edition are clear enough in the Constantinople edition.    The gigantic visitor of Joseph, the narrator, the latter undoubtedly the  author himself, is a strange being. Like the guide of Gil Bias on his  adventures, he is called a demon, and he glares and emits smoke and fire.  But he proves amenable to argument, and quotes the story of the  washerwoman, to show how it was that he became a reformed character. This  devil quotes the Rabbis, and is easily convinced that it is unwise for him  to wed an ignorant bride. It would seem as though Zabara were, on the one  hand, hurling a covert attack against some one who had advised him to leave  Barcelona to his own hurt, while, on the other hand, he is satirizing the  current beliefs of Jews and Christians in evil spirits. More than one  passage is decidedly anti-Christian, and it would not be surprising to find  that the framework of the romance had been adopted with polemic intention.    The character of the framework becomes more interesting when it is realized  that Zabara derived it from some version of the legends of which King  Solomon is the hero. The king had various adventures with a being more or  less demoniac in character, who bears several names: Asmodeus, Saturn,  Marcolf, or Morolf. That the model for Zabara's visitor was Solomon's  interlocutor, is not open to doubt. The Solomon legend occurs in many  forms, but in all Marcolf (or whatever other name he bears) is a keen  contester with the king in a battle of wits. No doubt, at first Marcolf  filled a serious, respectable role; in course of time, his character  degenerated into that of a clown or buffoon. It is difficult to summarize  the legend, it varies so considerably in the versions. Marcolf in the  best-known forms, which are certainly older than Zabara, is \"right rude and  great of body, of visage greatly misshapen and foul.\" Sometimes he is a  dwarf, sometimes a giant; he is never normal. He appears with his  counterpart, a sluttish wife, before Solomon, who, recognizing him as  famous for his wit and wisdom, challenges him to a trial of wisdom,  promising great rewards as the prize of victory. The two exchange a series  of questions and answers, which may be compared in spirit, though not in  actual content, with the questions and answers to be found in Zabara.  Marcolf succeeds in thoroughly tiring out the king, and though the  courtiers are for driving Marcolf off with scant courtesy, the king  interposes, fulfils his promise, and dismisses his adversary with gifts.  Marcolf leaves the court, according to one version, with the noble remark,  _Ubi non est lex, ibi non est rex_.    This"]]]
