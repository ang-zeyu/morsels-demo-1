Presently Annie saw, far down the street on the opposite side, a man  come out from a factory, look around him up and down the street and go  back into the factory.    \"O sister, he has gone in again,\" said Annie. \"Well,\" said Vanie, \"perhaps  he is not the one God is going to send. If he is he will come back again.\"    \"There he comes again,\" said Annie. \"He walks this way. He seems looking  for something. He walks slow, and is without his hat. He puts his hand  to his head, as if he did not know what to do. Oh, sister, he has gone in  again; what shall we do?\"    \"That may not be the one whom God will send to help us,\" said Vanie. \"If  he is, he will come out again.\"    \"Oh yes, there he is; this time with his hat on,\" said Annie. \"He comes  this way; he walks slowly, looking around on every side. He does not see  us, perhaps the trees hide us. Now he sees us, and is coming quickly.\"    A brawny German in broken accent asks:    \"O children, what is the matter?\"    \"O sir,\" said Annie, Sister here is so sick she cannot walk and we cannot  get home.\"    \"Where do you live my dear?\"    \"At the end of this street; you can see the house from here.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the man, \"I takes you home.\"    So the strong man gathered the sick child in his arms, and with her head  pillowed upon his shoulder, carried her to the place pointed out by the  younger girl. Annie ran around the house to tell her mother that there  was a man at the front door wishing to see her. The astonished mother,  with a mixture of surprise and joy, took charge of the precious burden  and the child was laid upon a bed.    After thanking the man, she expected him to withdraw, but instead, he  stood turning his hat in his hands as one who wishes to say something,  but knows not how to begin.    The mother observing this, repeated her thanks and finally said: \"Would  you like me to pay you for bringing my child home?\"    \"Oh, no,\" said he with tears, \"God pays me! God pays me! I would like  to tell you something, but I speak English so poorly that I fear you  will not understand.\"    The mother assured him that she was used to the German and could understand  him very well.    \"I am the proprietor of an ink factory,\" said he. \"My men work by the  piece. I have to keep separate accounts with each. I pay them every  Saturday. At twelve o'clock they will be at my desk for their money.  This week I have had many hindrances and was behind with my books. I was  working hard at them with the sweat on my face, in my great anxiety to  be ready in time. Suddenly I could not see the figures; the words in the  book all ran together, and I had a plain impression on my mind that some  one in the street wished to see me. I went out, looked up and down the  street, but seeing no one, went back to my desk and wrote a little.  Presently the darkness was greater than before, and the impression  stronger than before, that someone in the street needed me.    \"Again I went out, looked up and down the street, walked a little way,  puzzled to know what I meant. Was my hard work and were the cares of  business driving me out of my wits? Unable to solve the mystery I turned  again into my shop and to my desk.    \"This time my fingers refused to grasp the pen. I found myself unable  to write a word, or make a figure; but the impression was stronger than  ever on my mind, that someone needed my help. A voice seemed to say:  'Why don't you go out as I tell you? There is need of your help.' This  time I took my hat on going out, resolved to stay till I found out whether  I was losing my senses, or there was a duty for me to do. I walked some  distance without seeing anyone, and was more and more puzzled, till I  came opposite the children, and found that there was indeed need of my  help. I cannot understand it, madam.\"    As the noble German was about leaving the house, the younger girl had  the courage to say: \"O mother, we prayed.\"    Thus the mystery was solved, and with tear-stained cheeks, a heaving  breast, and a humble, grateful heart, the kind man went back to his  accounts.    I have enjoyed many a happy hour in conversation with Annie in her own  house since she has a home of her own. The last I knew of Annie and Vanie  they were living in the same city, earnest Christian women. Their children  were growing up around them, who, I hope, will have like confidence in  mother, and faith in God.    --Jeigh Arrh.    Annie was the wife of James A. Clayton of San Jose, California. I have  enjoyed their hospitality and esteem both very highly.    --James Rogers.        GOD HEALS A BLIND GIRL    One day we went to visit Ruth's aunt. While there, a very dear friend  of Ruth's aunt came to visit her, bringing Annie, her little four-year-old  girl who was the same age as Ruth. They had taken Annie to an eye doctor  the day before and he had said that she was blind and would always be  blind. The two children played together. Ruth would lead her by the hand  and this touched her heart very much.    After we went home, she came to me crying, and said, \"Mama, Annie is  blind. Mama, Annie can't see anything. Mama, Annie can't even see her  mama!\"    I (Ruth's mother) answered, \"No, Annie can't see anything.\"    \"Can't Jesus make Annie see her mama?\" Ruth asked.    \"Yes, Jesus can do anything,\" Mother told her.    \"I'll never quit praying till Jesus makes Annie see her Mama,\" she said.  She knelt down and prayed, and for several days she would come in from  her play ever so often and kneel down and pray and ask Jesus to make  Annie see her mama.    In a few days we received word that Annie said \"Oh, I see my mama!\" From  then on she could see.    When the girls were eight years old and Ruth had moved from that state,  her aunt (who had also moved) received a letter from Annie's mother,  saying, \"Annie seems to be losing her eyesight again.\" She said also  that she would like for her to send Annie a new dress while she could  still see it, and if she knew where Ruth was to ask her to pray for Annie  that Jesus would not let her go blind again. Ruth was at the home of her  aunt when she received this letter. She prayed earnestly again and God  answered her prayer and gave Annie her eyesight. It was even better than  normal.    The last time I saw Annie she was a grown woman around forty, and she  showed me how she could see to read a long way from the light, which we  could not do. Surely God did a wonderful work in answer to a little  girl's prayer.    Children, let's pray; and when we pray, believe that God hears, and  receive the good things that he has to give us and others.    --Essie Wilson.        \"DOES THIS RAILROAD LEAD TO HEAVEN?\"    In traveling we often meet with persons of different nationalities and  languages; we also meet with incidents of various character, some  sorrowful, others, joyful and instructive. One of the latter character  I witnessed recently while traveling upon the cars. The train was going  west and the time was evening. At a station a little girl about eight  years old came aboard, carrying a budget under her arm. She then commenced  an eager scrutiny of faces, but all were strange to her. She appeared  weary, and placing her budget for a pillow, she prepared to try and  secure a little sleep. Soon the conductor came along collecting tickets  and fare. Observing him she asked him if she might lie there. The  gentlemanly conductor replied that she might, and then kindly asked for  her ticket. She informed him that she had none, when the following  conversation ensued. Said the conductor:    \"Where are you going?\"    \"I am going to heaven,\" she answered.    \"Who pays your fare?\" he asked again.    She then said, \"Mister, does this railroad lead to heaven, and does Jesus  travel on it?\"    \"I think not,\" he answered, \"Why did you think so?\"    [Illustration]    \"Why sir, before my ma died she used to sing to me of a heavenly railroad,  and you looked so nice and kind that I thought this was the road. My ma  used to sing of Jesus on the heavenly railroad, and that He paid the  fare for everybody, and that the train stopped at every station to take  people on board; but my ma don't sing to me any more. Nobody sings to  me now; and I thought I'd take the cars and go to ma. Mister, do you  sing to your little girl about the railroad that goes to heaven? You  have a little girl, haven't you?\"    He replied, weeping, \"No my little dear I have no little girl now. I had  one once; but she died some time ago, and went to heaven.\"    \"Did she go over this railroad, and are you going to see her now?\" she  asked.    By this time every person in the coach was upon their feet, and most of  them were weeping. An attempt to describe what I witnessed is almost  futile. Some said: \"God bless the little girl.\" Hearing some person say  that she was an angel, the little girl earnestly replied: \"Yes, my ma  used to say that I would be an angel some time.\"    Addressing herself once more to the conductor, she asked him, \"Do you  love Jesus? I do, and if you love Him, He will let you ride to heaven  on His railroad. I am going there and I wish you would go with me. I  know Jesus will let me into heaven when I get there and He will let you  in, too, and everybody that will ride on His railroad--yes, all these  people. Wouldn't you like to see heaven and Jesus, and your little girl?\"    These words, so pathetically and innocently uttered, brought a great  gush of tears from all eyes, but most profusely from those of the  conductor. Some who were traveling on the heavenly railroad shouted aloud  for joy.    She asked the conductor: \"Mister, may I lie here until we get to heaven?\"    \"Yes, dear, yes,\" he answered.    \"Will you wake me up then so that I may see my ma and your little girl  and Jesus?\" she asked, \"for I do so much want to see them all.\"    The answer came in broken accents but in words very tenderly spoken \"Yes,  dear angel,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#2)"],[1," frankly.\"    \"Charge right ahead,\" assented Cuthbert.    \"Deeply sensible as I am of----\"    \"I know. Of the honour and the compliment and all that. But, passing  lightly over all that guff, what seems to be the trouble? I love you to  distraction----\"    \"Love is not everything.\"    \"You're wrong,\" said Cuthbert, earnestly. \"You're right off it.  Love----\" And he was about to dilate on the theme when she interrupted  him.    \"I am a girl of ambition.\"    \"And very nice, too,\" said Cuthbert.    \"I am a girl of ambition,\" repeated Adeline, \"and I realize that the  fulfilment of my ambitions must come through my husband. I am very  ordinary myself----\"    \"What!\" cried Cuthbert. \"You ordinary? Why, you are a pearl among  women, the queen of your sex. You can't have been looking in a glass  lately. You stand alone. Simply alone. You make the rest look like  battered repaints.\"    \"Well,\" said Adeline, softening a trifle, \"I believe I am fairly  good-looking----\"    \"Anybody who was content to call you fairly good-looking would describe  the Taj Mahal as a pretty nifty tomb.\"    \"But that is not the point. What I mean is, if I marry a nonentity I  shall be a nonentity myself for ever. And I would sooner die than be a  nonentity.\"    \"And, if I follow your reasoning, you think that that lets _me_  out?\"    \"Well, really, Mr. Banks, _have_ you done anything, or are you  likely ever to do anything worth while?\"    Cuthbert hesitated.    \"It's true,\" he said, \"I didn't finish in the first ten in the Open,  and I was knocked out in the semi-final of the Amateur, but I won the  French Open last year.\"    \"The--what?\"    \"The French Open Championship. Golf, you know.\"    \"Golf! You waste all your time playing golf. I admire a man who is more  spiritual, more intellectual.\"    A pang of jealousy rent Cuthbert's bosom.    \"Like What's-his-name Devine?\" he said, sullenly.    \"Mr. Devine,\" replied Adeline, blushing faintly, \"is going to be a  great man. Already he has achieved much. The critics say that he is  more Russian than any other young English writer.\"    \"And is that good?\"    \"Of course it's good.\"    \"I should have thought the wheeze would be to be more English than any  other young English writer.\"    \"Nonsense! Who wants an English writer to be English? You've got to be  Russian or Spanish or something to be a real success. The mantle of the  great Russians has descended on Mr. Devine.\"    \"From what I've heard of Russians, I should hate to have that happen to  _me_.\"    \"There is no danger of that,\" said Adeline scornfully.    \"Oh! Well, let me tell you that there is a lot more in me than you  think.\"    \"That might easily be so.\"    \"You think I'm not spiritual and intellectual,\" said Cuthbert, deeply  moved. \"Very well. Tomorrow I join the Literary Society.\"    Even as he spoke the words his leg was itching to kick himself for  being such a chump, but the sudden expression of pleasure on Adeline's  face soothed him; and he went home that night with the feeling that he  had taken on something rather attractive. It was only in the cold, grey  light of the morning that he realized what he had let himself in for.    I do not know if you have had any experience of suburban literary  societies, but the one that flourished under the eye of Mrs. Willoughby  Smethurst at Wood Hills was rather more so than the average. With my  feeble powers of narrative, I cannot hope to make clear to you all that  Cuthbert Banks endured in the next few weeks. And, even if I could, I  doubt if I should do so. It is all very well to excite pity and terror,  as Aristotle recommends, but there are limits. In the ancient Greek  tragedies it was an ironclad rule that all the real rough stuff should  take place off-stage, and I shall follow this admirable principle. It  will suffice if I say merely that J. Cuthbert Banks had a thin time.  After attending eleven debates and fourteen lectures on _vers libre_  Poetry, the Seventeenth-Century Essayists, the Neo-Scandinavian  Movement in Portuguese Literature, and other subjects of a similar  nature, he grew so enfeebled that, on the rare occasions when he had  time for a visit to the links, he had to take a full iron for his mashie  shots.    It was not simply the oppressive nature of the debates and lectures  that sapped his vitality. What really got right in amongst him was the  torture of seeing Adeline's adoration of Raymond Parsloe Devine. The  man seemed to have made the deepest possible impression upon her  plastic emotions. When he spoke, she leaned forward with parted lips  and looked at him. When he was not speaking--which was seldom--she  leaned back and looked at him. And when he happened to take the next  seat to her, she leaned sideways and looked at him. One glance at Mr.  Devine would have been more than enough for Cuthbert; but Adeline found  him a spectacle that never palled. She could not have gazed at him with  a more rapturous intensity if she had been a small child and he a  saucer of ice-cream. All this Cuthbert had to witness while still  endeavouring to retain the possession of his faculties sufficiently to  enable him to duck and back away if somebody suddenly asked him what he  thought of the sombre realism of Vladimir Brusiloff. It is little  wonder that he tossed in bed, picking at the coverlet, through  sleepless nights, and had to have all his waistcoats taken in three  inches to keep them from sagging.    This Vladimir Brusiloff to whom I have referred was the famous Russian  novelist, and, owing to the fact of his being in the country on a  lecturing tour at the moment, there had been something of a boom in his  works. The Wood Hills Literary Society had been studying them for  weeks, and never since his first entrance into intellectual circles had  Cuthbert Banks come nearer to throwing in the towel. Vladimir  specialized in grey studies of hopeless misery, where nothing happened  till page three hundred and eighty, when the moujik decided to commit  suicide. It was tough going for a man whose deepest reading hitherto  had been Vardon on the Push-Shot, and there can be no greater proof of  the magic of love than the fact that Cuthbert stuck it without a cry.  But the strain was terrible and I am inclined to think that he must  have cracked, had it not been for the daily reports in the papers of  the internecine strife which was proceeding so briskly in Russia.  Cuthbert was an optimist at heart, and it seemed to him that, at the  rate at which the inhabitants of that interesting country were  murdering one another, the supply of Russian novelists must eventually  give out.    One morning, as he tottered down the road for the short walk which was  now almost the only exercise to which he was equal, Cuthbert met  Adeline. A spasm of anguish flitted through all his nerve-centres as he  saw that she was accompanied by Raymond Parsloe Devine.    \"Good morning, Mr. Banks,\" said Adeline.    \"Good morning,\" said Cuthbert hollowly.    \"Such good news about Vladimir Brusiloff.\"    \"Dead?\" said Cuthbert, with a touch of hope.    \"Dead? Of course not. Why should he be? No, Aunt Emily met his manager  after his lecture at Queen's Hall yesterday, and he has promised that  Mr. Brusiloff shall come to her next Wednesday reception.\"    \"Oh, ah!\" said Cuthbert, dully.    \"I don't know how she managed it. I think she must have told him that  Mr. Devine would be there to meet him.\"    \"But you said he was coming,\" argued Cuthbert.    \"I shall be very glad,\" said Raymond Devine, \"of the opportunity of  meeting Brusiloff.\"    \"I'm sure,\" said Adeline, \"he will be very glad of the opportunity of  meeting you.\"    \"Possibly,\" said Mr. Devine. \"Possibly. Competent critics have said  that my work closely resembles that of the great Russian Masters.\"    \"Your psychology is so deep.\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"And your atmosphere.\"    \"Quite.\"    Cuthbert in a perfect agony of spirit prepared to withdraw from this  love-feast. The sun was shining brightly, but the world was black to  him. Birds sang in the tree-tops, but he did not hear them. He might  have been a moujik for all the pleasure he found in life.    \"You will be there, Mr. Banks?\" said Adeline, as he turned away.    \"Oh, all right,\" said Cuthbert.    When Cuthbert had entered the drawing-room on the following Wednesday  and had taken his usual place in a distant corner where, while able to  feast his gaze on Adeline, he had a sporting chance of being overlooked  or mistaken for a piece of furniture, he perceived the great Russian  thinker seated in the midst of a circle of admiring females. Raymond  Parsloe Devine had not yet arrived.    His first glance at the novelist surprised Cuthbert. Doubtless with the  best motives, Vladimir Brusiloff had permitted his face to become  almost entirely concealed behind a dense zareba of hair, but his eyes  were visible through the undergrowth, and it seemed to Cuthbert that  there was an expression in them not unlike that of a cat in a strange  backyard surrounded by small boys. The man looked forlorn and hopeless,  and Cuthbert wondered whether he had had bad news from home.    This was not the case. The latest news which Vladimir Brusiloff had had  from Russia had been particularly cheering. Three of his principal  creditors had perished in the last massacre of the _bourgeoisie_,  and a man whom he owed for five years for a samovar and a pair of  overshoes had fled the country, and had not been heard of since. It was  not bad news from home that was depressing Vladimir. What was wrong  with him was the fact that this was the eighty-second suburban literary  reception he had been compelled to attend since he had landed in the  country on his lecturing tour, and he was sick to death of it. When his  agent had first suggested the trip, he had signed on the dotted line  without an instant's hesitation. Worked out in roubles, the fees  offered had seemed just about right. But now, as he peered"]]]
