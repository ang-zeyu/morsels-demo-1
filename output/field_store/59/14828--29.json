"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6340"],[0,"Literary Lapses (#2)"],[1,"ndoline, half timidly, \"Edwin is  an American.\"    \"You surprise me indeed,\" answered Lord Oxhead; \"and  yet,\" he continued, turning to his daughter with the  courtly grace that marked the nobleman of the old school,  \"why should we not respect and admire the Americans?  Surely there have been great names among them. Indeed,  our ancestor Sir Amyas Oxhead was, I think, married to  Pocahontas--at least if not actually married\"--the earl  hesitated a moment.    \"At least they loved one another,\" said Gwendoline simply.    \"Precisely,\" said the earl, with relief, \"they loved one  another, yes, exactly.\" Then as if musing to himself,  \"Yes, there have been great Americans. Bolivar was an  American. The two Washingtons--George and Booker--are  both Americans. There have been others too, though for  the moment I do not recall their names. But tell me,  Gwendoline, this Edwin of yours--where is his family  seat?\"    \"It is at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, father.\"    \"Ah! say you so?\" rejoined the earl, with rising interest.  \"Oshkosh is, indeed, a grand old name. The Oshkosh are  a Russian family. An Ivan Oshkosh came to England with  Peter the Great and married my ancestress. Their descendant  in the second degree once removed, Mixtup Oshkosh, fought  at the burning of Moscow and later at the sack of Salamanca  and the treaty of Adrianople. And Wisconsin too,\" the  old nobleman went on, his features kindling with animation,  for he had a passion for heraldry, genealogy, chronology,  and commercial geography; \"the Wisconsins, or better, I  think, the Guisconsins, are of old blood. A Guisconsin  followed Henry I to Jerusalem and rescued my ancestor  Hardup Oxhead from the Saracens. Another Guisconsin...\"    \"Nay, father,\" said Gwendoline, gently interrupting,  \"Wisconsin is not Edwin's own name: that is, I believe,  the name of his estate. My lover's name is Edwin Einstein.\"    \"Einstein,\" repeated the earl dubiously--\"an Indian name  perhaps; yet the Indians are many of them of excellent  family. An ancestor of mine...\"    \"Father,\" said Gwendoline, again interrupting, \"here is  a portrait of Edwin. Judge for yourself if he be noble.\"  With this she placed in her father's hand an American  tin-type, tinted in pink and brown. The picture represented  a typical specimen of American manhood of that Anglo-Semitic  type so often seen in persons of mixed English and Jewish  extraction. The figure was well over five feet two inches  in height and broad in proportion. The graceful sloping  shoulders harmonized with the slender and well-poised  waist, and with a hand pliant and yet prehensile. The  pallor of the features was relieved by a drooping black  moustache.    Such was Edwin Einstein to whom Gwendoline's heart, if  not her hand, was already affianced. Their love had been  so simple and yet so strange. It seemed to Gwendoline  that it was but a thing of yesterday, and yet in reality  they had met three weeks ago. Love had drawn them  irresistibly together. To Edwin the fair English girl  with her old name and wide estates possessed a charm that  he scarcely dared confess to himself. He determined to  woo her. To Gwendoline there was that in Edwin's bearing,  the rich jewels that he wore, the vast fortune that rumour  ascribed to him, that appealed to something romantic and  chivalrous in her nature. She loved to hear him speak of  stocks and bonds, corners and margins, and his father's  colossal business. It all seemed so noble and so far  above the sordid lives of the people about her. Edwin,  too, loved to hear the girl talk of her father's estates,  of the diamond-hilted sword that the saladin had given,  or had lent, to her ancestor hundreds of years ago. Her  description of her father, the old earl, touched something  romantic in Edwin's generous heart. He was never tired  of asking how old he was, was he robust, did a shock, a  sudden shock, affect him much? and so on. Then had come  the evening that Gwendoline loved to live over and over  again in her mind when Edwin had asked her in his  straightforward, manly way, whether--subject to certain  written stipulations to be considered later--she would  be his wife: and she, putting her hand confidingly in  his hand, answered simply, that--subject to the consent  of her father and pending always the necessary legal  formalities and inquiries--she would.    It had all seemed like a dream: and now Edwin Einstein  had come in person to ask her hand from the earl, her  father. Indeed, he was at this moment in the outer hall  testing the gold leaf in the picture-frames with his  pen-knife while waiting for his affianced to break the  fateful news to Lord Oxhead.    Gwendoline summoned her courage for a great effort.  \"Papa,\" she said, \"there is one other thing that it is  fair to tell you. Edwin's father is in business.\"    The earl started from his seat in blank amazement. \"In  business!\" he repeated, \"the father of the suitor of the  daughter of an Oxhead in business! My daughter the  step-daughter of the grandfather of my grandson! Are  you mad, girl? It is too much, too much!\"    \"But, father,\" pleaded the beautiful girl in anguish,  \"hear me. It is Edwin's father--Sarcophagus Einstein,  senior--not Edwin himself. Edwin does nothing. He has  never earned a penny. He is quite unable to support  himself. You have only to see him to believe it. Indeed,  dear father, he is just like us. He is here now, in this  house, waiting to see you. If it were not for his great  wealth...\"    \"Girl,\" said the earl sternly, \"I care not for the man's  riches. How much has he?\"    \"Fifteen million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,\"  answered Gwendoline. Lord Oxhead leaned his head against  the mantelpiece. His mind was in a whirl. He was trying  to calculate the yearly interest on fifteen and a quarter  million dollars at four and a half per cent reduced to  pounds, shillings, and pence. It was bootless. His brain,  trained by long years of high living and plain thinking,  had become too subtle, too refined an instrument for  arithmetic...       *   *   *   *   *    At this moment the door opened and Edwin Einstein stood  before the earl. Gwendoline never forgot what happened.  Through her life the picture of it haunted her--her lover  upright at the door, his fine frank gaze fixed inquiringly  on the diamond pin in her father's necktie, and he, her  father, raising from the mantelpiece a face of agonized  amazement.    \"You! You!\" he gasped. For a moment he stood to his full  height, swaying and groping in the air, then fell prostrate  his full length upon the floor. The lovers rushed to his  aid. Edwin tore open his neckcloth and plucked aside his  diamond pin to give him air. But it was too late. Earl  Oxhead had breathed his last. Life had fled. The earl  was extinct. That is to say, he was dead.    The reason of his death was never known. Had the sight  of Edwin killed him? It might have. The old family doctor,  hurriedly summoned, declared his utter ignorance. This,  too, was likely. Edwin himself could explain nothing.  But it was observed that after the earl's death and his  marriage with Gwendoline he was a changed man; he dressed  better, talked much better English.    The wedding itself was quiet, almost sad. At Gwendoline's  request there was no wedding breakfast, no bridesmaids,  and no reception, while Edwin, respecting his bride's  bereavement, insisted that there should be no best man,  no flowers, no presents, and no honeymoon.    Thus Lord Oxhead's secret died with him. It was probably  too complicated to be interesting anyway.          Boarding-House Geometry    DEFINITIONS AND AXIOMS    All boarding-houses are the same boarding-house.    Boarders in the same boarding-house and on the same flat  are equal to one another.    A single room is that which has no parts and no magnitude.    The landlady of a boarding-house is a parallelogram--that  is, an oblong angular figure, which cannot be described,  but which is equal to anything.    A wrangle is the disinclination of two boarders to each  other that meet together but are not in the same line.    All the other rooms being taken, a single room is said  to be a double room.      POSTULATES AND PROPOSITIONS    A pie may be produced any number of times.    The landlady can be reduced to her lowest terms by a  series of propositions.    A bee line may be made from any boarding-house to any  other boarding-house.    The clothes of a boarding-house bed, though produced ever  so far both ways, will not meet.    Any two meals at a boarding-house are together less than  two square meals.    If from the opposite ends of a boarding-house a line be  drawn passing through all the rooms in turn, then the  stovepipe which warms the boarders will lie within that  line.    On the same bill and on the same side of it there should  not be two charges for the same thing.    If there be two boarders on the same flat, and the amount  of side of the one be equal to the amount of side of the  other, each to each, and the wrangle between one boarder  and the landlady be equal to the wrangle between the  landlady and the other, then shall the weekly bills of  the two boarders be equal also, each to each.    For if not, let one bill be the greater.    Then the other bill is less than it might have been--which  is absurd.          The Awful Fate of Melpomenus Jones    Some people--not you nor I, because we are so awfully  self-possessed--but some people, find great difficulty  in saying good-bye when making a call or spending the  evening. As the moment draws near when the visitor feels  that he is fairly entitled to go away he rises and says  abruptly, \"Well, I think I...\" Then the people say, \"Oh,  must you go now? Surely it's early yet!\" and a pitiful  struggle ensues.    I think the saddest case of this kind of thing that I  ever knew was that of my poor friend Melpomenus Jones,  a curate--such a dear young man, and only twenty-three!  He"]]]
