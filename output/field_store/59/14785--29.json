We remembered that Aunt Olivia  had written to father that Cecily was a true Ward--she had no sense  of humour. We did not know what this meant, but we thought it was not  exactly complimentary.    Still, we were both inclined to think we would like Cecily better than  Felicity. To be sure, Felicity was a stunning beauty. But, with the  swift and unerring intuition of childhood, which feels in a moment what  it sometimes takes maturity much time to perceive, we realized that  she was rather too well aware of her good looks. In brief, we saw that  Felicity was vain.    \"It's a wonder the Story Girl isn't over to see you,\" said Uncle Alec.  \"She's been quite wild with excitement about your coming.\"    \"She hasn't been very well all day,\" explained Cecily, \"and Aunt Olivia  wouldn't let her come out in the night air. She made her go to bed  instead. The Story Girl was awfully disappointed.\"    \"Who is the Story Girl?\" asked Felix.    \"Oh, Sara--Sara Stanley. We call her the Story Girl partly because  she's such a hand to tell stories--oh, I can't begin to describe it--and  partly because Sara Ray, who lives at the foot of the hill, often comes  up to play with us, and it is awkward to have two girls of the same name  in the same crowd. Besides, Sara Stanley doesn't like her name and she'd  rather be called the Story Girl.\"    Dan speaking for the first time, rather sheepishly volunteered the  information that Peter had also been intending to come over but had to  go home to take some flour to his mother instead.    \"Peter?\" I questioned. I had never heard of any Peter.    \"He is your Uncle Roger's handy boy,\" said Uncle Alec. \"His name is  Peter Craig, and he is a real smart little chap. But he's got his share  of mischief, that same lad.\"    \"He wants to be Felicity's beau,\" said Dan slyly.    \"Don't talk silly nonsense, Dan,\" said Aunt Janet severely.    Felicity tossed her golden head and shot an unsisterly glance at Dan.    \"I wouldn't be very likely to have a hired boy for a beau,\" she  observed.    We saw that her anger was real, not affected. Evidently Peter was not an  admirer of whom Felicity was proud.    We were very hungry boys; and when we had eaten all we could--and oh,  what suppers Aunt Janet always spread!--we discovered that we were very  tired also--too tired to go out and explore our ancestral domains, as we  would have liked to do, despite the dark.    We were quite willing to go to bed; and presently we found ourselves  tucked away upstairs in the very room, looking out eastward into the  spruce grove, which father had once occupied. Dan shared it with us,  sleeping in a bed of his own in the opposite corner. The sheets and  pillow-slips were fragrant with lavender, and one of Grandmother King's  noted patchwork quilts was over us. The window was open and we heard the  frogs singing down in the swamp of the brook meadow. We had heard frogs  sing in Ontario, of course; but certainly Prince Edward Island frogs  were more tuneful and mellow. Or was it simply the glamour of old family  traditions and tales which was over us, lending its magic to all sights  and sounds around us? This was home--father's home--OUR home! We  had never lived long enough in any one house to develop a feeling  of affection for it; but here, under the roof-tree built by  Great-Grandfather King ninety years ago, that feeling swept into our  boyish hearts and souls like a flood of living sweetness and tenderness.    \"Just think, those are the very frogs father listened to when he was a  little boy,\" whispered Felix.    \"They can hardly be the SAME frogs,\" I objected doubtfully, not feeling  very certain about the possible longevity of frogs. \"It's twenty years  since father left home.\"    \"Well, they're the descendants of the frogs he heard,\" said Felix, \"and  they're singing in the same swamp. That's near enough.\"    Our door was open and in their room across the narrow hall the girls  were preparing for bed, and talking rather more loudly than they might  have done had they realized how far their sweet, shrill voices carried.    \"What do you think of the boys?\" asked Cecily.    \"Beverley is handsome, but Felix is too fat,\" answered Felicity  promptly.    Felix twitched the quilt rather viciously and grunted. But I began to  think I would like Felicity. It might not be altogether her fault that  she was vain. How could she help it when she looked in the mirror?    \"I think they're both nice and nice looking,\" said Cecily.    Dear little soul!    \"I wonder what the Story Girl will think of them,\" said Felicity, as if,  after all, that was the main thing.    Somehow, we, too, felt that it was. We felt that if the Story Girl did  not approve of us it made little difference who else did or did not.    \"I wonder if the Story Girl is pretty,\" said Felix aloud.    \"No, she isn't,\" said Dan instantly, from across the room. \"But you'll  think she is while she's talking to you. Everybody does. It's only when  you go away from her that you find out she isn't a bit pretty after  all.\"    The girls' door shut with a bang. Silence fell over the house. We  drifted into the land of sleep, wondering if the Story Girl would like  us.        CHAPTER II. A QUEEN OF HEARTS    I wakened shortly after sunrise. The pale May sunshine was showering  through the spruces, and a chill, inspiring wind was tossing the boughs  about.    \"Felix, wake up,\" I whispered, shaking him.    \"What's the matter?\" he murmured reluctantly.    \"It's morning. Let's get up and go down and out. I can't wait another  minute to see the places father has told us of.\"    We slipped out of bed and dressed, without arousing Dan, who was still  slumbering soundly, his mouth wide open, and his bed-clothes kicked off  on the floor. I had hard work to keep Felix from trying to see if he  could \"shy\" a marble into that tempting open mouth. I told him it would  waken Dan, who would then likely insist on getting up and accompanying  us, and it would be so much nicer to go by ourselves for the first time.    Everything was very still as we crept downstairs. Out in the kitchen we  heard some one, presumably Uncle Alec, lighting the fire; but the heart  of house had not yet begun to beat for the day.    We paused a moment in the hall to look at the big \"Grandfather\" clock.  It was not going, but it seemed like an old, familiar acquaintance to  us, with the gilt balls on its three peaks; the little dial and pointer  which would indicate the changes of the moon, and the very dent in its  wooden door which father had made when he was a boy, by kicking it in a  fit of naughtiness.    Then we opened the front door and stepped out, rapture swelling in our  bosoms. There was a rare breeze from the south blowing to meet us; the  shadows of the spruces were long and clear-cut; the exquisite skies of  early morning, blue and wind-winnowed, were over us; away to the west,  beyond the brook field, was a long valley and a hill purple with firs  and laced with still leafless beeches and maples.    Behind the house was a grove of fir and spruce, a dim, cool place where  the winds were fond of purring and where there was always a resinous,  woodsy odour. On the further side of it was a thick plantation of  slender silver birches and whispering poplars; and beyond it was Uncle  Roger's house.    Right before us, girt about with its trim spruce hedge, was the  famous King orchard, the history of which was woven into our earliest  recollections. We knew all about it, from father's descriptions, and in  fancy we had roamed in it many a time and oft.    It was now nearly sixty years since it had had its beginning, when  Grandfather King brought his bride home. Before the wedding he had  fenced off the big south meadow that sloped to the sun; it was the  finest, most fertile field on the farm, and the neighbours told young  Abraham King that he would raise many a fine crop of wheat in that  meadow. Abraham King smiled and, being a man of few words, said nothing;  but in his mind he had a vision of the years to be, and in that vision  he saw, not rippling acres of harvest gold, but great, leafy avenues of  wide-spreading trees laden with fruit to gladden the eyes of children  and grandchildren yet unborn.    It was a vision to develop slowly into fulfilment. Grandfather King was  in no hurry. He did not set his whole orchard out at once, for he wished  it to grow with his life and history, and be bound up with all of good  and joy that should come to his household. So the morning after he had  brought his young wife home they went together to the south meadow and  planted their bridal trees. These trees were no longer living; but they  had been when father was a boy, and every spring bedecked themselves in  blossom as delicately tinted as Elizabeth King's face when she walked  through the old south meadow in the morn of her life and love.    When a son was born to Abraham and Elizabeth a tree was planted in the  orchard for him. They had fourteen children in all, and each child  had its \"birth tree.\" Every family festival was commemorated in like  fashion, and every beloved visitor who spent a night under their roof  was expected to plant a tree in the orchard. So it came to pass that  every tree in it was a fair green monument to some love or delight of  the vanished years. And each grandchild had its tree, there, also, set  out by grandfather when the tidings of its birth reached him; not always  an apple tree--perhaps it was a plum, or cherry or pear. But it was  always known by the name of the person for whom, or by whom, it was  planted; and Felix and I knew as much about \"Aunt Felicity's pears,\" and  \"Aunt Julia's cherries,\" and \"Uncle Alec's apples,\" and the \"Rev. Mr.  Scott's plums,\" as if we had been born and bred among them.    And now we had come to the orchard; it was before us; we had only  to open that little whitewashed gate"]]]
