He can't be happy. And anyhow, isn't it worth a few millions  to be Lady Ernest Borrow, and have the privilege of restoring the most  beautiful old castle in Ireland? I'm sure Killeena would let her.\"    \"He would, out of sheer, weak kindness of heart! But she's far too  thickly gilded an heiress for me to aspire to. A few thousands a year  is my most ambitious figure for a wife. Look at the men collecting  around her and the wonderful lady you call Cleopatra. Why Cleopatra?  Did sponsors in baptism--\"    \"No, they didn't. _Why_ she's Cleopatra is as weird a history as why  I'm Mrs. Jones. But she's Monny's aunt--at least, she's a half-sister  of Peter Gilder, and as his only living relative his will makes her  Monny's guardian till the girl marries or reaches twenty-five. A  strange guardian! But he didn't know she was going to turn into  Cleopatra. She wisely waited to do that until he was dead; so it came  on only a year ago. It was a Bond Street crystal-gazer transplanted to  Fifth Avenue told her who she really was: you know Sayda Sabri, the  woman who has the illuminated mummy? It's Cleopatra's idea that Monny's  second mourning for Peter should be white, nothing but white.\"    \"Her idea! But I thought Miss Monny, as you call her, adopted only her  own ideas. How can a mere half-aunt, labouring under the name of  Cleopatra, force her--\"    \"Well, you see, white's very becoming; and as for the Cleopatra part,  it pleases our princess to tolerate that. It's part of the queer  history that's mixing me up with the family. We've come to spend the  season in Egypt because Cleopatra thinks she's Cleopatra; also because  Monny (that's what she's chosen to call herself since she tried to lisp  'Resamond' and couldn't) because Monny has read 'The Garden of Allah,'  and wants the 'desert to take her.' That book had nothing to do with  Egyptian deserts; but any desert will do for Monny. What she expects it  to do with her exactly when it has taken her, on the strength of a Cook  ticket, I don't quite know; but I may later, because she vows she'll  keep me at her side with hooks of steel all through the tour--unless  something worse happens to me, or to some of us _because_ of me.\"  \"Biddy, dear, don't be morbid. Nothing bad will happen,\" I tried to  reassure her.    \"Thank you for saying so. It cheers me up. We women folk are so in the  habit of believing anything you men folk tell us. It's really quaint!\"    \"Stop rotting, and tell me about yourself; and a truce to heiresses and  Cleopatras. You know I'm dying to hear.\"    \"Not a syllable, until you've told me about _your_self. Where you're  going, and what the dickens for!\"    We laughed into each other's eyes. To do so, I had to look a long way  down, and she a long way up. This in itself is a pleasantly Victorian  thing for a man to do in these days of Jerrybuilt girls, on the same  level or a story or two higher than himself. I'm not a tall man: just  the dull average five foot ten or eleven that appears taller, while it  keeps lean--so naturally I have a hopeless yearning for nymph-like  creatures who pretend to be engaged when I ask them to dance. Still,  there's consolation and homely comfort in talking with a little woman  who makes you feel the next best thing to a giant. Biddy is an  old-fashioned five foot four in her highest heels; and as she smiled up at  me I saw that she hadn't changed a jot in the last ten years, despite  the tragedy that had involved her. Not a silver thread in the black  hair, not a line on the creamy round face.    \"You're just yourself,\" I said.    \"I oughtn't to be. I know that very well. I ought to be a Dido and  Niobe and Cassandra rolled into one. I'm a brute not to be dead or look  a hag. I've gone through horrors, and the secrets I know could put  dozens of people in prison, if not electrocute them. But you see I'm  not the right type of person for the kind of life I've had, as I should  be if I were in a story book, and the author had created me to suit my  background. I can't help flapping up out of my own ashes before they're  cold. I can't help laughing in the face of fate.\"    \"And looking a girl of twenty-three, at most, while you do it!\"    \"If I look a girl, I must be a phenomenon as well as a phoenix, for  nobody knows better than you that my Bible age is thirty-one if it's a  day. And I think Burke and Debrett have got the same tale to tell about  you, eh?\"    \"They have. I was always delighted to share something with you.\"    \"You can have the whole share of my age over twenty-six. There's one  advantage 'Mrs. Jones' has. She can, if her looking-glass doesn't  forbid, go back to that classic age dear to all sensible adventuresses.  I'm afraid I come under the head of adventuress, with my alias, and  travelling as companion to the rich Miss Gilder.\"    \"You're the last person on earth for the part! Your fate was thrust on  you. You've thrust yourself on no one. Miss Gilder 'achieved' you.\"    \"Collected me, rather, as one of her 'specimens.' She has a noble  weakness for lame ducks, and though she fails sometimes in trying to  strengthen their game legs, she tries gloriously. She and her aunt have  been travelling in France and Italy, guided by instinct and French  maids, and already Monny has picked up two weird _protegees_, sure to  bring her to grief. The most exciting and deadly specimen is a  perfectly beautiful American girl just married to a Turkish Bey who met  her in Paris, and is taking her home to Egypt. I haven't even seen the  unfortunate houri, because the Turk has shut her up in their cabin and  pretends she's seasick. Monny doesn't believe in the seasickness, and  sends secret notes in presents of flowers and boxes of chocolate. But I  have seen the Turk. He's pink and white and looks angelic, except for a  gleam deep down in his eyes, if Monny inquires after his wife when any  of her best young men are hanging about. Especially when there's Neill  Sheridan, a young Egyptologist from Harvard, Monny met in Paris, or  Willis Bailey, a fascinating sculptor who wants to study the crystal  eyes of wooden statues in the Museum at Cairo. He is going to make them  the fashion in America, next year. Yes, Madame Rechid Bey is a most  explosive _protegee_ for a girl to have, on her way to Egypt. I'm not  sure even I am not innocuous by comparison; though I do wish you hadn't  reminded me of my poor little step-daughter Esme, in her convent-school.  If any one should get the idea that Monny--but I won't put it  in words! Besides me, and the brand-new bride of Rechid Bey ('Wretched  Bey' is our name for him), there's one more _protegee_, a Miss Rachel  Guest from Salem, Massachusetts, a school-teacher taking her first  holiday. That _sounds_ harmless, and it looks harmless to an amateur;  but wait till _you_ meet her and see what instinct tells you about her  eyes. Oh, we shall have ructions! But that reminds me. You haven't told  me where you're bound--or anything.\"    \"Thanks for putting me among the 'specimens.' But this sample hasn't  yet been collected by Miss Gilder.\"    \"You might be her salvation, and keep her out of mischief. She's quite  wild now with sheer joy because she's going to Egypt. But do be  serious, and tell me all I pine to know, if you want me to do the same  by you.\"    \"Well--though it's unimportant compared to what you have to tell! I'm  an insignificant second secretary to Sir Raymond Ronalds, the British  Ambassador at Rome. I've got four months' leave----\"    \"Ah, _that's_ what comes of duffing so skilfully, and avoiding all the  things you didn't want to do, till you got exactly what you did want! I  remember when we were small boy and girl, and you used to walk down to  the vicarage every day, to talk Greek or Latin or something with  father----\"    \"No, to see you!\"    \"Well, you used to tell me, if you couldn't be the greatest  prize-fighter or the greatest opera-singer in the world, you thought  you'd like to be a diplomat.    \"I haven't become a diplomat yet, in spite of Foreign Office grubbing.  But I've been enjoying life pretty well, fagging up Arabic and modern  Greek, and playing about with pleasant people, while pretending to do  my duty. Now I've got leave on account of a mild fever which turned out  a blessing in disguise. I could have found no other excuse for Egypt  this winter.\"    \"You speak as if you had some special reason for going to Egypt.\"    \"I've been wishing to go, more or less, for years, because you know--if  you haven't forgotten--I was accidentally born in Cairo while my father  was fighting in Alexandria. My earliest recollections are of Egypt, for  we lived there till I was four--about the time I met and fell in love  with you. I've always thought I'd like to polish up old memories. But  my special hurry is because I'm anxious to meet a friend, a chap I  admire and love beyond all others. I want to see him for his own sake,  and for the sake of a plan we have, which may make a lot of difference  for our future.\"    \"How exciting! Did I ever know him?\"    \"I think not.\"    \"Well? Don't you mean to tell me who he is?\"    I hesitated, sorry I had let myself go: because Anthony had written  that he didn't want his movements discussed at present.    \"I'll tell you another time,\" I said. \"I want to talk about you.  Anybody else is irrelevant.\"    \"Clever Duffer! Your friend is a _secret_.\"    \"Not he! But if there's a secret anywhere, it's only a dull, dusty sort  of secret. You wouldn't be interested.\"    \"Women never are, in secrets. Well, I'm glad somebody else besides  myself has a mystery to hide.\"    \"You're very quick.\"    \"I'm Irish! But I'm merciful.

That wasn't a joke, Bunny; it's not a thing to  joke about; mud-poultices and dry meals, with teetotal poisons in  between, were to be my portion too. You stiffen your lip at that, eh,  Bunny? I told you that you never would or could have stood it; but it was  the only game to play for the Emerald Stakes. It kept one above suspicion  all the time. And then I didn't mind that part as much as you would, or  as my hunting pal did; he was driven to fainting at the doctor's place  one day, in the forlorn hope of a toothful of brandy to bring him round.  But all he got was a glass of cheap Marsala.\"    \"But did you win those stakes after all?\"    \"Of course I did, Bunny,\" said Raffles below his breath, and with a look  that I remembered later. \"But the waiters are listening as it is, and  I'll tell you the rest some other time. I suppose you know what brought  me back so soon?\"    \"Hadn't you finished your cure?\"    \"Not by three good days. I had the satisfaction of a row royal with the  Lord High Humbug to account for my hurried departure. But, as a matter of  fact, if Teddy Garland hadn't got his Blue at the eleventh hour I should  be at Carlsbad still.\"    E.M. Garland (Eton and Trinity) was the Cambridge wicketkeeper, and one  of the many young cricketers who owed a good deal to Raffles. They had  made friends in some country-house week, and foregathered afterward in  town, where the young fellow's father had a house at which Raffles  became a constant guest. I am afraid I was a little prejudiced both  against the father, a retired brewer whom I had never met, and the son  whom I did meet once or twice at the Albany. Yet I could quite understand  the mutual attraction between Raffles and this much younger man; indeed  he was a mere boy, but like so many of his school he seemed to have a  knowledge of the world beyond his years, and withal such a spontaneous  spring of sweetness and charm as neither knowledge nor experience could  sensibly pollute. And yet I had a shrewd suspicion that wild oats had  been somewhat freely sown, and that it was Raffles who had stepped in and  taken the sower in hand, and turned him into the stuff of which Blues are  made. At least I knew that no one could be sounder friend or saner  counsellor to any young fellow in need of either. And many there must be  to bear me out in their hearts; but they did not know their Raffles as I  knew mine; and if they say that was why they thought so much of him, let  them have patience, and at last they shall hear something that need not  make them think the less.    \"I couldn't let poor Teddy keep at Lord's,\" explained Raffles, \"and me  not there to egg him on! You see, Bunny, I taught him a thing or two in  those little matches we played together last August. I take a fatherly  interest in the child.\"    \"You must have done him a lot of good,\" I suggested, \"in every way.\"    Raffles looked up from his bill and asked me what I meant. I saw he was  not pleased with my remark, but I was not going back on it.    \"Well, I should imagine you had straightened him out a bit, if you ask  me.\"    \"I didn't ask you, Bunny, that's just the point!\" said Raffles. And I  watched him tip the waiter without the least _arriere-pensee_ on  either side.    \"After all,\" said I, on our way down the marble stair, \"you have told me  a good deal about the lad. I remember once hearing you say he had a lot  of debts, for example.\"    \"So I was afraid,\" replied Raffles, frankly; \"and between ourselves, I  offered to finance him before I went abroad. Teddy wouldn't hear of it;  that hot young blood of his was up at the thought, though he was  perfectly delightful in what he said. So don't jump to rotten  conclusions, Bunny, but stroll up to the Albany and have a drink.\"    And when we had reclaimed our hats and coats, and lit our Sullivans in  the hall, out we marched as though I were now part-owner of the place  with Raffles.    \"That,\" said I, to effect a thorough change of conversation,  since I felt at one with all the world, \"is certainly the finest  grill in Europe.\"    \"That's why we went there, Bunny.\"    \"But must I say I was rather surprised to find you a member of a place  where you tip the waiter and take a ticket for your hat!\"    I was not surprised, however, to hear Raffles defend his own  caravanserai.    \"I would go a step further,\" he remarked, \"and make every member show his  badge as they do at Lord's.\"    \"But surely the porter knows the members by sight?\"    \"Not he! There are far too many thousands of them.\"    \"I should have thought he must.\"    \"And I know he doesn't.\"    \"Well, you ought to know, A.J., since you're a member yourself.\"    \"On the contrary, my dear Bunny, I happen to know because I never was  one!\"          CHAPTER II    \"His Own Familiar Friend\"      How we laughed as we turned into Whitehall! I began to feel I had been  wrong about Raffles after all, and that enhanced my mirth. Surely this  was the old gay rascal, and it was by some uncanny feat of his stupendous  will that he had appeared so haggard on the platform. In the London  lamplight that he loved so well, under a starry sky of an almost  theatrical blue, he looked another man already. If such a change was due  to a few draughts of bitter beer and a few ounces of fillet steak, then I  felt I was the brewers' friend and the vegetarians' foe for life.  Nevertheless I could detect a serious side to my companion's mood,  especially when he spoke once more of Teddy Garland, and told me that he  had cabled to him also before leaving Carlsbad. And I could not help  wondering, with a discreditable pang, whether his intercourse with that  honest lad could have bred in Raffles a remorse for his own misdeeds,  such as I myself had often tried, but always failed, to produce.    So we came to the Albany in sober frame, for all our recent levity,  thinking at least no evil for once in our lawless lives. And there was  our good friend Barraclough, the porter, to salute and welcome us in the  courtyard.    \"There's a gen'leman writing you a letter upstairs,\" said he to Raffles.  \"It's Mr. Garland, sir, so I took him up.\"    \"Teddy!\" cried Raffles, and took the stairs two at a time.    I followed rather heavily. It was not jealousy, but I did feel rather  critical of this mushroom intimacy. So I followed up, feeling that the  evening was spoilt for me--and God knows I was right! Not till my dying  day shall I forget the tableau that awaited me in those familiar rooms. I  see it now as plainly as I see the problem picture of the year, which  lies in wait for one in all the illustrated papers; indeed, it was a  problem picture itself in flesh and blood.    Raffles had opened his door as only Raffles could open doors, with the  boyish thought of giving the other boy a fright; and young Garland had  very naturally started up from the bureau, where he was writing, at the  sudden clap of his own name behind him. But that was the last of his  natural actions. He did not advance to grasp Raffles by the hand; there  was no answering smile of welcome on the fresh young face which used to  remind me of the Phoebus in Guido's Aurora, with its healthy pink and  bronze, and its hazel eye like clear amber. The pink faded before our  gaze, the bronze turned a sickly sallow; and there stood Teddy Garland as  if glued to the bureau behind him, clutching its edge with all his might.  I can see his knuckles gleaming like ivory under the back of each  sunburnt hand.    \"What is it? What are you hiding?\" demanded Raffles. His love for the lad  had rung out in his first greeting; his puzzled voice was still jocular  and genial, but the other's attitude soon strangled that. All this time I  had been standing in vague horror on the threshold; now Raffles beckoned  me in and switched on more light. It fell full upon a ghastly and a  guilty face, that yet stared bravely in the glare. Raffles locked the  door behind us, put the key in his pocket, and strode over to the desk.    No need to report their first broken syllables: enough that it was no  note young Garland was writing, but a cheque which he was laboriously  copying into Raffles's cheque-book, from an old cheque abstracted from a  pass-book with A. J. RAFFLES in gilt capitals upon its brown leather  back. Raffles had only that year opened a banking account, and I  remembered his telling me how thoroughly he meant to disregard the  instructions on his cheque-book by always leaving it about to advertise  the fact. And this was the result. A glance convicted his friend of  criminal intent: a sheet of notepaper lay covered with trial signatures.  Yet Raffles could turn and look with infinite pity upon the miserable  youth who was still looking defiantly on him.    \"My poor chap!\" was all he said.    And at that the broken boy found the tongue of a hoarse and  quavering old man.    \"Won't you hand me over and be done with it?\" he croaked. \"Must you  torture me yourself?\"    It was all I could do to refrain from putting in my word, and telling the  fellow it was not for him to ask questions. Raffles merely inquired  whether he had thought it all out before.    \"God knows I hadn't, A. J.! I came up to write you a note, I swear I  did,\" said Garland with a sudden sob.    \"No need to swear it,\" returned Raffles, actually smiling. \"Your word's  quite good enough for me.\"    \"God bless you for that, after this!\" the other choked, in terrible  disorder now.    \"It was pretty obvious,\" said Raffles reassuringly.    \"Was it? Are you sure? You do remember offering me a cheque last month,  and my refusing it?\"    \"Why, of course I do!\" cried Raffles, with such spontaneous heartiness  that I could see he had never thought of it since mentioning the matter  to me at our meal. What I could not see was any reason for such  conspicuous relief, or the extenuating quality"]]]
