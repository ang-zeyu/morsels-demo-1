In the fair land of Nova Scotia, a maritime province, there is a ridge  called North Mountain, overlooking the Bay of Fundy on one side and  the fertile Annapolis valley on the other. On the northern slope of  the range grows the hardy spruce-tree, well adapted for ship-timbers,  of which many vessels of all classes have been built. The people of  this coast, hardy, robust, and strong, are disposed to compete in the  world's commerce, and it is nothing against the master mariner if the  birthplace mentioned on his certificate be Nova Scotia. I was born in  a cold spot, on coldest North Mountain, on a cold February 20, though  I am a citizen of the United States--a naturalized Yankee, if it may  be said that Nova Scotians are not Yankees in the truest sense of the  word. On both sides my family were sailors; and if any Slocum should  be found not seafaring, he will show at least an inclination to  whittle models of boats and contemplate voyages. My father was the  sort of man who, if wrecked on a desolate island, would find his way  home, if he had a jack-knife and could find a tree. He was a good  judge of a boat, but the old clay farm which some calamity made his  was an anchor to him. He was not afraid of a capful of wind, and he  never took a back seat at a camp-meeting or a good, old-fashioned  revival.    As for myself, the wonderful sea charmed me from the first. At the age  of eight I had already been afloat along with other boys on the bay,  with chances greatly in favor of being drowned. When a lad I filled  the important post of cook on a fishing-schooner; but I was not long in  the galley, for the crew mutinied at the appearance of my first duff,  and \"chucked me out\" before I had a chance to shine as a culinary  artist. The next step toward the goal of happiness found me before the  mast in a full-rigged ship bound on a foreign voyage. Thus I came  \"over the bows,\" and not in through the cabin windows, to the command  of a ship.    My best command was that of the magnificent ship _Northern Light_, of  which I was part-owner. I had a right to be proud of her, for at that  time--in the eighties--she was the finest American sailing-vessel  afloat. Afterward I owned and sailed the _Aquidneck_, a little bark  which of all man's handiwork seemed to me the nearest to perfection of  beauty, and which in speed, when the wind blew, asked no favors of  steamers, I had been nearly twenty years a shipmaster when I quit her  deck on the coast of Brazil, where she was wrecked. My home voyage to  New York with my family was made in the canoe _Liberdade_, without  accident.    [Illustration: Drawn by W. Taber. The _Northern Light_, Captain Joshua  Slocum, bound for Liverpool, 1885.]    My voyages were all foreign. I sailed as freighter and trader  principally to China, Australia, and Japan, and among the Spice  Islands. Mine was not the sort of life to make one long to coil up  one's ropes on land, the customs and ways of which I had finally  almost forgotten. And so when times for freighters got bad, as at last  they did, and I tried to quit the sea, what was there for an old  sailor to do? I was born in the breezes, and I had studied the sea as  perhaps few men have studied it, neglecting all else. Next in  attractiveness, after seafaring, came ship-building. I longed to be  master in both professions, and in a small way, in time, I  accomplished my desire. From the decks of stout ships in the worst  gales I had made calculations as to the size and sort of ship safest  for all weather and all seas. Thus the voyage which I am now to  narrate was a natural outcome not only of my love of adventure, but of  my lifelong experience.    One midwinter day of 1892, in Boston, where I had been cast up from  old ocean, so to speak, a year or two before, I was cogitating whether  I should apply for a command, and again eat my bread and butter on the  sea, or go to work at the shipyard, when I met an old acquaintance, a  whaling-captain, who said: \"Come to Fairhaven and I'll give you a  ship. But,\" he added, \"she wants some repairs.\" The captain's terms,  when fully explained, were more than satisfactory to me. They included  all the assistance I would require to fit the craft for sea. I was  only too glad to accept, for I had already found that I could not  obtain work in the shipyard without first paying fifty dollars to a  society, and as for a ship to command--there were not enough ships to  go round. Nearly all our tall vessels had been cut down for  coal-barges, and were being ignominiously towed by the nose from port  to port, while many worthy captains addressed themselves to Sailors'  Snug Harbor.    The next day I landed at Fairhaven, opposite New Bedford, and found  that my friend had something of a joke on me. For seven years the joke  had been on him. The \"ship\" proved to be a very antiquated sloop  called the _Spray,_ which the neighbors declared had been built in the  year 1. She was affectionately propped up in a field, some distance  from salt water, and was covered with canvas. The people of Fairhaven,  I hardly need say, are thrifty and observant. For seven years they had  asked, \"I wonder what Captain Eben Pierce is going to do with the old  _Spray?\"_ The day I appeared there was a buzz at the gossip exchange:  at last some one had come and was actually at work on the old _Spray._  \"Breaking her up, I s'pose?\" \"No; going to rebuild her.\" Great was the  amazement. \"Will it pay?\" was the question which for a year or more I  answered by declaring that I would make it pay.    My ax felled a stout oak-tree near by for a keel, and Farmer Howard,  for a small sum of money, hauled in this and enough timbers for the  frame of the new vessel. I rigged a steam-box and a pot for a boiler.  The timbers for ribs, being straight saplings, were dressed and  steamed till supple, and then bent over a log, where they were secured  till set. Something tangible appeared every day to show for my labor,  and the neighbors made the work sociable. It was a great day in the  _Spray_ shipyard when her new stem was set up and fastened to the new  keel. Whaling-captains came from far to survey it. With one voice they  pronounced it \"A 1,\" and in their opinion \"fit to smash ice.\" The  oldest captain shook my hand warmly when the breast-hooks were put in,  declaring that he could see no reason why the _Spray_ should not \"cut  in bow-head\" yet off the coast of Greenland. The much-esteemed  stem-piece was from the butt of the smartest kind of a pasture oak. It  afterward split a coral patch in two at the Keeling Islands, and did  not receive a blemish. Better timber for a ship than pasture white oak  never grew. The breast-hooks, as well as all the ribs, were of this  wood, and were steamed and bent into shape as required. It was hard  upon March when I began work in earnest; the weather was cold; still,  there were plenty of inspectors to back me with advice. When a  whaling-captain hove in sight I just rested on my adz awhile and  \"gammed\" with him.    New Bedford, the home of whaling-captains, is connected with Fairhaven  by a bridge, and the walking is good. They never \"worked along up\" to  the shipyard too often for me. It was the charming tales about arctic  whaling that inspired me to put a double set of breast-hooks in the  _Spray_, that she might shunt ice.    The seasons came quickly while I worked. Hardly were the ribs of the  sloop up before apple-trees were in bloom. Then the daisies and the  cherries came soon after. Close by the place where the old _Spray_ had  now dissolved rested the ashes of John Cook, a revered Pilgrim father.  So the new _Spray_ rose from hallowed ground. From the deck of the new  craft I could put out my hand and pick cherries that grew over the  little grave. The planks for the new vessel, which I soon came to put  on, were of Georgia pine an inch and a half thick. The operation of  putting them on was tedious, but, when on, the calking was easy. The  outward edges stood slightly open to receive the calking, but the  inner edges were so close that I could not see daylight between them.  All the butts were fastened by through bolts, with screw-nuts  tightening them to the timbers, so that there would be no complaint  from them. Many bolts with screw-nuts were used in other parts of the  construction, in all about a thousand. It was my purpose to make my  vessel stout and strong.

Many years have elapsed since I quitted Europe, to explore the  interior of the New Continent. Devoted from my earliest youth to  the study of nature, feeling with enthusiasm the wild beauties of a  country guarded by mountains and shaded by ancient forests, I  experienced in my travels, enjoyments which have amply compensated  for the privations inseparable from a laborious and often agitated  life. These enjoyments, which I endeavoured to impart to my readers  in my 'Remarks upon the Steppes,' and in the 'Essay on the  Physiognomy of Plants,' were not the only fruits I reaped from an  undertaking formed with the design of contributing to the progress  of natural philosophy. I had long prepared myself for the  observations which were the principal object of my journey to the  torrid zone. I was provided with instruments of easy and convenient  use, constructed by the ablest makers, and I enjoyed the special  protection of a government which, far from presenting obstacles to  my investigations, constantly honoured me with every mark of regard  and confidence. I was aided by a courageous and enlightened friend,  and it was singularly propitious to the success of our participated  labour, that the zeal and equanimity of that friend never failed,  amidst the fatigues and dangers to which we were sometimes exposed.    Under these favourable circumstances, traversing regions which for  ages have remained almost unknown to most of the nations of Europe,  I might add even to Spain, M. Bonpland and myself collected a  considerable number of materials, the publication of which may  throw some light on the history of nations, and advance the study  of nature.    I had in view a two-fold purpose in the travels of which I now  publish the historical narrative. I wished to make known the  countries I had visited; and to collect such facts as are fitted to  elucidate a science of which we as yet possess scarcely the  outline, and which has been vaguely denominated Natural History of  the World, Theory of the Earth, or Physical Geography. The last of  these two objects seemed to me the most important. I was  passionately devoted to botany and certain parts of zoology, and I  flattered myself that our investigations might add some new species  to those already known, both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms;  but preferring the connection of facts which have been long  observed, to the knowledge of insulated facts, although new, the  discovery of an unknown genus seemed to me far less interesting  than an observation on the geographical relations of the vegetable  world, on the migrations of the social plants, and the limit of the  height which their different tribes attain on the flanks of the  Cordilleras.    The natural sciences are connected by the same ties which link  together all the phenomena of nature. The classification of the  species, which must be considered as the fundamental part of  botany, and the study of which is rendered attractive and easy by  the introduction of natural methods, is to the geography of plants  what descriptive mineralogy is to the indication of the rocks  constituting the exterior crust of the globe. To comprehend the  laws observed in the position of these rocks, to determine the age  of their successive formations, and their identity in the most  distant regions, the geologist should be previously acquainted with  the simple fossils which compose the mass of mountains, and of  which the names and character are the object of oryctognostical  knowledge. It is the same with that part of the natural history of  the globe which treats of the relations plants have to each other,  to the soil whence they spring, or to the air which they inhale and  modify. The progress of the geography of plants depends in a great  measure on that of descriptive botany; and it would be injurious to  the advancement of science, to attempt rising to general ideas,  whilst neglecting the knowledge of particular facts.    I have been guided by these considerations in the course of my  inquiries; they were always present to my mind during the period of  my preparatory studies. When I began to read the numerous  narratives of travels, which compose so interesting a part of  modern literature, I regretted that travellers, the most  enlightened in the insulated branches of natural history, were  seldom possessed of sufficient variety of knowledge to avail  themselves of every advantage arising from their position. It  appeared to me, that the importance of the results hitherto  obtained did not keep pace with the immense progress which, at the  end of the eighteenth century, had been made in several departments  of science, particularly geology, the history of the modifications  of the atmosphere, and the physiology of animals and plants. I saw  with regret, (and all scientific men have shared this feeling) that  whilst the number of accurate instruments was daily increasing, we  were still ignorant of the height of many mountains and elevated  plains; of the periodical oscillations of the aerial ocean; of the  limit of perpetual snow within the polar circle and on the borders  of the torrid zone; of the variable intensity of the magnetic  forces, and of many other phenomena equally important.    Maritime expeditions and circumnavigatory voyages have conferred  just celebrity on the names of the naturalists and astronomers who  have been appointed by various governments to share the dangers of  those undertakings; but though these eminent men have given us  precise notions of the external configuration of countries, of the  natural history of the ocean, and of the productions of islands and  coasts, it must be admitted that maritime expeditions are less  fitted to advance the progress of geology and other parts of  physical science, than travels into the interior of a continent.  The advancement of the natural sciences has been subordinate to  that of geography and nautical astronomy. During a voyage of  several years, the land but seldom presents itself to the  observation of the mariner, and when, after lengthened expectation,  it is descried, he often finds it stripped of its most beautiful  productions. Sometimes, beyond a barren coast, he perceives a ridge  of mountains covered with verdure, but its distance forbids  examination, and the view serves only to excite regret.    Journeys by land are attended with considerable difficulties in the  conveyance of instruments and collections, but these difficulties  are compensated by advantages which it is unnecessary to enumerate.  It is not by sailing along a coast that we can discover the  direction of chains of mountains, and their geological  constitution, the climate of each zone, and its influence on the  forms and habits of organized beings. In proportion to the extent  of continents, the greater on the surface of the soil are the  riches of animal and vegetable productions; the more distant the  central chain of mountains from the sea-shore, the greater is the  variety in the bosom of the earth, of those stony strata, the  regular succession of which unfolds the history of our planet. As  every being considered apart is impressed with a particular type,  so, in like manner, we find the same distinctive impression in the  arrangement of brute matter organized in rocks, and also in the  distribution and mutual relations of plants and animals. The great  problem of the physical description of the globe, is the  determination of the form of these types, the laws of their  relations with each other, and the eternal ties which link the  phenomena of life, and those of inanimate nature.    Having stated the general object I had in view in my expeditions, I  will now hasten to give a slight sketch of the whole of the  collections and observations which we have accumulated, and the  union of which is the aim and end of every scientific journey. The  maritime war, during our abode in America, having rendered  communication with Europe very uncertain, we found ourselves  compelled, in order to diminish the chance of losses, to form three  different collections. Of these, the first was embarked for Spain  and France, the second for the United States and England, and the  third, which was the most considerable, remained almost constantly  under our own eyes. Towards the close of our expedition, this last  collection formed forty-two boxes, containing an herbal of six  thousand equinoctial plants, seeds, shells, insects, and (what had  hitherto never been brought to Europe) geological specimens, from  the Chimborazo, New Grenada, and the banks of the river Amazon.    After our journey to the Orinoco, we left a part of these  collections at the island of Cuba, intending to take them on our  return from Peru to Mexico. The rest followed us during the space  of five years, on the chain of the Andes, across New Spain, from  the shores of the Pacific to the coasts of the Caribbean Sea. The"]]]
