It was from  Hiawatha the people learned to raise corn and beans; through his  instructions they were enabled to remove obstructions from the water  courses and clear their fishing grounds; and by him they were helped to  get the mastery over the great monsters which overran the country. The  people listened to him with ever increasing delight; and he gave them  wise laws and maxims from the Great Spirit, for he had been second to  him only in power previous to his taking up his dwelling with mankind.    Having selected the Onondagas for his tribe, years passed away in  prosperity; the Onondagas assumed an elevated rank for their wisdom and  learning, among the other tribes, and there was not one of these which  did not yield its assent to their superior privilege of lighting the  council-fire.    But in the midst of the high tide of their prosperity, suddenly there  arose a great alarm at the invasion of a ferocious band of warriors from  the North of the Great Lakes; and as these bands advanced, an  indiscriminate slaughter was made of men, women, and children.  Destruction fell upon all alike.    The public alarm was great; and Hiawatha advised them not to waste their  efforts in a desultory manner, but to call a council of all the tribes  that could be gathered together, from the East to the West; and, at the  same time, he appointed a meeting to take place on an eminence on the  banks of the Onondaga Lake. There, accordingly, the chief men assembled,  while the occasion brought together a vast multitude of men, women, and  children, who were in expectation of some marvellous deliverance.    Three days elapsed, and Hiawatha did not appear. The multitude began to  fear that he was not coming, and messengers were despatched for him to  Tioto, who found him depressed with a presentiment that evil would  follow his attendance. These fears were overruled by the eager  persuasions of the messengers; and Hiawatha, taking his daughter with  him, put his wonderful canoe in its element and set out for the council.  The grand assemblage that was to avert the threatened danger appeared  quickly in sight, as he moved rapidly along in his magic canoe; and when  the people saw him, they sent up loud shouts of welcome until the  venerated man landed. A steep ascent led up the banks of the lake to the  place occupied by the council; and, as he walked up, a loud whirring  sound was heard above, as if caused by some rushing current of air.  Instantly, the eyes of all were directed upward to the sky, where was  seen a dark spot, something like a small cloud, descending rapidly, and  as it approached, enlarging in its size and increasing in velocity.  Terror and alarm filled the minds of the multitude and they scattered in  confusion. But as soon as he had gained the eminence, Hiawatha stood  still, causing his daughter to do the same--deeming it cowardly to fly,  and impossible, if it was attempted, to divert the designs of the Great  Spirit. The descending object now assumed a more definite aspect; and,  as it came nearer, revealed the shape of a gigantic white bird, with  wide-extended and pointed wings. This bird came down with ever  increasing velocity, until, with a mighty swoop, it dropped upon the  girl, crushing her at once to the earth.    The fixed face of Hiawatha alone indicated his consciousness of his  daughter's death; while in silence he signalled to the warriors, who had  stood watching the event in speechless consternation. One after the  other stepped up to the prostrate bird, which was killed by its violent  fall, and selecting a feather from its snow-white plumage, decorated  himself therewith. [Footnote: Since this event, say the Indians of this  tribe, the plumage of the white heron has been used for their  decorations on the war-path.]    But now a new affliction fell upon Hiawatha; for, on removing the  carcass of the bird, not a trace could be discovered of his daughter.  Her body had vanished from the earth. Shades of anguish contracted the  dark face of Hiawatha. He stood apart in voiceless grief. No word was  spoken. His people waited in silence, until at length arousing himself,  he turned to them and walked in calm dignity to the head of the council.    The first day he listened with attentive gravity to the plans of the  different speakers; on the next day he arose and said: \"My friends and  brothers; you are members of many tribes, and have come from a great  distance. We have come to promote the common interest, and our mutual  safety. How shall it be accomplished? To oppose these Northern hordes in  tribes singly, while we are at variance often with each other, is  impossible. By uniting in a common band of brotherhood we may hope to  succeed. Let this be done, and we shall drive the enemy from our land.  Listen to me by tribes. You, the Mohawks, who are sitting under the  shadow of the great tree, whose branches spread wide around, and whose  roots sink deep into the earth, shall be the first nation, because you  are warlike and mighty. You, the Oneidas, who recline your bodies  against the everlasting stone that cannot be moved, shall be the second  nation, because you always give wise counsel. You, the Onondagas, who  have your habitation at the foot of the great hills, and are  overshadowed by their crags, shall be the third nation, because you are  greatly gifted in speech. You, the Senecas, whose dwelling is in the  dark forest, and whose home is all over the land, shall be the fourth  nation, because of your superior cunning in hunting. And you, the  Cayugas, the people who live in the open country and possess much  wisdom, shall be the fifth nation, because you understand better the art  of raising corn and beans, and making lodges. Unite, ye five nations,  and have one common interest, and no foe shall disturb and subdue you.  You, the people who are the feeble bushes, and you who are a fishing  people, may place yourselves under our protection, and we will defend  you. And you of the South and West may do the same, and we will protect  you. We earnestly desire the alliance and friendship of you all.  Brothers, if we unite in this great bond, the Great Spirit will smile  upon us, and we shall be free, prosperous, and happy; but if we remain  as we are, we shall be subject to his frown. We shall be enslaved,  ruined, perhaps annihilated. We may perish under the war-storm, and our  names be no longer remembered by good men, nor be repeated in the dance  and song. Brothers, those are the words of Hiawatha. I have spoken. I am  done.\" [Footnote: Canassatego, a renowned chief of the Confederacy, in  his remarkable piece of advice to the Colonial Commissioners of  Lancaster in July, 1744, seems to imply that there was an error in this  plan of Hiawatha, as it did not admit all nations into their Confederacy  with equal rights.]    The next day his plan of union was considered and adopted by the  council, after which Hiawatha again addressed the people with wise words  of counsel, and at the close of this speech bade them farewell; for he  conceived that his mission to the Iroquois was accomplished, and he  might announce his withdrawal to the skies. He then went down to the  shore, and assumed his seat in his mystical canoe. Sweet music was heard  in the air as he seated himself; and while the wondering multitude stood  gazing at their beloved chief, he was silently wafted from sight, and  they saw him no more. He passed to the Isle of the Blessed, inhabited by  Owayneo [Footnote: A name for their Great Spirit in the dialect of the  Iroquois.] and his manitos.      And they said, \"Farewell forever!\"    Said, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"    And the forests, dark and lonely,    Moved through all their depths of darkness^    Sighed, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"    And the waves upon the margin,    Rising, rippling on the pebbles,    Sobbed, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"    And the heron, the shuh-shu-gah,    From her haunts among the fen-lands,    Screamed, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"      Thus departed Hiawatha,    Hiawatha the Beloved,    In the glory of the sunset,    In the purple mists of evening,    To the regions of the home-wind,    Of the northwest wind, Keewaydin,    To the Islands of the Blessed,    To the kingdom of Ponemah,    To the land of the Hereafter.    [Footnote: \"The Song of Hiawatha,\" by H. W. Longfellow.]          CHAPTER II    BEOWULF      Old King Hrothgar built for himself a great palace, covered with gold,  with benches all round outside, and a terrace leading up to it. It was  bigger than any hall men had ever heard of, and there Hrothgar sat on  his throne to share with men the good things God had given him. A band  of brave knights gathered round him, all living together in peace and  joy.    But there came a wicked monster, Grendel, out of the moors. He stole  across the fens in the thick darkness, and touched the great iron bars  of the door of the hall, which immediately sprang open. Then, with his  eyes shooting out flame, he spied the knights sleeping after battle.  With his steel finger nails the hideous fiend seized thirty of them in  their sleep. He gave yells of joy, and sped as quick as lightning across  the moors, to reach his home with his prey.    When the knights awoke, they raised a great cry of sorrow, whilst the  aged King himself sat speechless with grief. None could do battle with  the monster, he was too strong, too horrible for any one to conquer. For  twelve long years Grendel warred against Hrothgar; like a dark shadow of  death he prowled round about the hall, and lay in wait for his men on  the misty moors. One thing he could not touch, and that was the King's  sacred throne.    Now there lived in a far-off land a youngster called Beowulf, who had  the strength of thirty men. He heard of the wicked deeds of Grendel, and  the sorrow of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6628"],[0,"The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth (#2)"],[1,"richly dressed than  usual, walked thence around to the front of the theater, and went in.  Ascending to the dress circle, he stood for a little time gazing around  upon the audience and occasionally upon the stage in his usual graceful  manner. He was subsequently observed by Mr. Ford, the proprietor of the  theater, to be slowly elbowing his way through the crowd that packed the  rear of the dress circle toward the right side, at the extremity of  which was the box where Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln and their companions were  seated. Mr. Ford casually noticed this as a slightly extraordinary  symptom of interest on the part of an actor so familiar with the routine  of the theater and the play.    The curtain had arisen on the third act, _Mrs. Mountchessington_ and  _Asa Trenchard_ were exchanging vivacious stupidities, when a young man,  so precisely resembling the one described as J. Wilkes Booth that be is  asserted to be the same, appeared before the open door of the  President's box, and prepared to enter.    The servant who attended Mr. Lincoln said politely, \"this is the  President's box, sir, no one is permitted to enter.\" \"I am a senator,\"  responded the person, \"Mr. Lincoln has sent for me.\" The attendant gave  way, and the young man passed into the box.    As he appeared at the door, taking a quick, comprehensive glance at the  interior, Major Rathbone arose. \"Are you aware, sir,\" he said,  courteously, \"upon whom you are intruding? This is the President's box,  and no one is admitted.\" The intruder answered not a word. Fastening his  eyes upon Mr. Lincoln, who had half turned his head to ascertain what  caused the disturbance, he stepped quickly back without the door.    Without this door there was an eyehole, bored it is presumed on the  afternoon of the crime, while the theater was deserted by all save a few  mechanics. Glancing through this orifice, John Wilkes Booth espied in a  moment the precise position of the President; he wore upon his wrinkling  face the pleasant embryo of an honest smile, forgetting in the mimic  scene the splendid successes of our arms for which he was responsible,  and the history he had filled so well.    The cheerful interior was lost to J. Wilkes Booth. He did not catch the  spirit of the delighted audience, of the flaming lamps flinging  illumination upon the domestic foreground and the gaily set stage. He  only cast one furtive glance upon the man he was to slay, and thrusting  one hand in his bosom, another in his skirt pocket, drew forth  simultaneously his deadly weapons. His right palm grasped a Derringer  pistol, his left a dirk.    Then, at a stride, he passed the threshold again, levelled his arm at  the President and bent the trigger.    A keen quick report and a puff of white smoke,--a close smell of powder  and the rush of a dark, imperfectly outlined figure,--and the  President's head dropped upon his shoulders: the ball was in his brain.    [Illustration: Map. The Theatre and its Surroundings.    _A_ Public School. _B_ Herndon House. _C_ Only vacant lot communicating  with the Alley. _D_ Only alley outlet to F street. _E_ Bank. _X_  Restaurant. _G_ Newspaper Office. _H_ Model House. _I_ House to which  the President was taken. _K_ Alley through which the Murderer escaped.]    The movements of the assassin were from henceforth quick as the  lightning, he dropped his pistol on the floor, and drawing a  bowie-knife, struck Major Rathbone, who opposed him, ripping through his  coat from the shoulder down, and inflicting a severe flesh wound in his  arm. He leaped then upon the velvet covered balustrade at the front of  the box, between Mrs. Lincoln and Miss Harris, and, parting with both  hands the flags that drooped on either side, dropped to the stage  beneath. Arising and turning full upon the audience, with the knife  lifted in his right hand above his head, he shouted \"_Sic, semper  tyrannis_--Virginia is avenged!\" Another instant he had fled across the  stage and behind the scenes. Colonel J. B. Stewart, the only person in  the audience who seemed to comprehend the deed he had committed, climbed  from his seat near the orchestra to the stage, and followed close  behind. The assassin was too fleet and too desperate, that fury  incarnate, meeting Mr. Withers, the leader of the orchestra, just behind  the scenes, had stricken him aside with a blow that fortunately was not  a wound; overturning Miss Jenny Gourlay, an actress, who came next in  his path, he gained, without further hindrance, the back door previously  left open at the rear of the theater; rushed through it; leaped upon the  horse held by Mr. Spangler, and without vouchsafing that person a word  of information, rode out through the alley leading into F street, and  thence rapidly away. His horse's hoofs might almost have been heard amid  the silence that for a few seconds dwelt in the interior of the theater.    [Illustration: _A_ Miss Laura Keene's Position. _D_ Movable partition  wall not in place on Friday. _P_ Position of the President. _X_ Flats.  _B_ Dark Passage-way--Position of Sentry. _E_ Exit, or Stage Door. _MM_  Entrance to Box. _CCC_ Entrance to Dress Circle, _H_ Position of Booth's  Horse.]    Then Mrs. Lincoln screamed, Miss Harris cried for water, and the full  ghastly truth broke upon all--\"The President is murdered!\" The scene  that ensued was as tumultuous and terrible as one of Dante's pictures of  hell. Some women fainted, others uttered piercing shrieks, and cries for  vengeance and unmeaning shouts for help burst from the mouths of men.  Miss Laura Keene, the actress, proved herself in this awful time as  equal to sustain a part in real tragedy as to interpret that of the  stage. Pausing one moment before the footlights to entreat the audience  to be calm, she ascended the stairs in the rear of Mr. Lincoln's box,  entered it, took the dying President's head in her lap, bathed it with  the water she had brought, and endeavoured to force some of the liquid  through the insensible lips. The locality of the wound was at first  supposed to be in the breast. It was not until after the neck and  shoulders had been bared and no mark discovered, that the dress of Miss  Keene, stained with blood, revealed where the ball had penetrated.    This moment gave the most impressive episode in the history of the  Continent.    The Chief Magistrate of thirty, millions of people--beloved, honored,  revered,--lay in the pent up closet of a play-house, dabbling with his  sacred blood the robes of an actress.    As soon as the confusion and crowd was partially overcome, the form of  the President was conveyed from the theater to the residence of Mr.  Peterson, on the opposite side of Tenth street. Here upon a bed, in a  little hastily prepared chamber, it was laid and attended by  Surgeon-General Barnes and other physicians, speedily summoned.    In the meanwhile the news spread through the capital, as if borne on  tongues of flame. Senator Sumner, hearing at his residence, of the  affair took a carriage and drove at a gallop to the White House, when he  heard where it had taken place, to find Robert Lincoln and other members  of the household still unaware of it. Both drove to Ford's Theater, and  were soon at the President's bedside. Secretary Stanton and the other  members of the cabinet were at hand almost as soon. A vast crowd,  surging up Pennsylvania avenue toward Willard's Hotel, cried, \"The  President is shot!\" \"President Lincoln is murdered.\" Another crowd  sweeping down the avenue met the first with the tidings, \"Secretary  Seward has been assassinated in bed.\" Instantly a wild apprehension of  an organized conspiracy and of other murders took possession of the  people. The shout \"to arms!\" was mingled with the expressions of sorrow  and rage that everywhere filled the air. \"Where is General Grant?\" or  \"where is Secretary Stanton!\" \"Where are the rest of the cabinet?\" broke  from thousands of lips. A conflagration of fire is not half so terrible  as was the conflagration of passion that rolled through the streets and  houses of Washington on that awful night.    The attempt on the life of Secretary Seward was perhaps as daring, if  not so dramatic, as the assassination of the President. At 9:20 o'clock  a man, tall, athletic, and dressed in light coloured clothes, alighted  from a horse in front of Mr. Seward's residence in Madison place, where  the secretary was lying, very feeble from his recent injuries. The  house, a solid three-story brick building, was formerly the old  Washington Club-house. Leaving his horse standing, the stranger rang at  the door, and informed the servant who admitted him that he desired to  see Mr. Seward. The servant responded that Mr. Seward was very ill, and  that no visitors were admitted. \"But I am a messenger from Dr. Verdi,  Mr. Seward's physician; I have a prescription which I must deliver to  him myself.\" The servant still demurring, the stranger, without further  parley, pushed him aside and ascended the stairs. Moving to the right,  he proceeded towards Mr. Seward's room, and was about to enter it, when  Mr. Frederick Seward appeared from an opposite doorway and demanded his  business. He responded in the same manner as to the servant below, but  being met with a refusal, suddenly closed the controversy by striking  Mr. Seward a severe and perhaps mortal blow across the forehead with the  butt of a pistol. As the first victim fell, Major Seward, another and  younger son of the secretary, emerged from his father's room. Without a  word the man drew a knife and struck the major several blows with it,  rushing into the chamber as he did so; then, after dealing the nurse a  horrible wound across the bowels, he sprang to the bed upon which the  secretary lay, stabbing him once in the face and neck. Mr. Seward arose  convulsively and fell from the bed to the floor. Turning and brandishing  his knife anew, the assassin fled from the room, cleared"]]]
