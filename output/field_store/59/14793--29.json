Before DOD was established in 1947, the Army Corps of Engineers   was under the War Department.    In 1977, 15 years after the last above-ground nuclear weapons test,  the Centers for Disease Control** noted a possible leukemia cluster  among a small group of soldiers present at Shot SMOKY, a test of  Operation PLUMBBOB, the series of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests  conducted in 1957.  Since that initial report by the Centers for  Disease Control, the Veterans Administration has received a number of  claims for medical benefits from former military personnel who believe  their health may have been affected by their participation in the  weapons testing program.     ** The Centers for Disease Control are part of the U.S.  Department of   Health and Human Services (formerly the U.S.  Department of Health,   Education, and Welfare).    In late 1977, DOD began a study to provide data to both the Centers  for Disease Control and the Veterans Administration on potential  exposures to ionizing radiation among the military and civilian  participants in atmospheric nuclear weapons testing.  DOD organized an  effort to:    o Identify DOD personnel who had taken part in the atmospheric nuclear  weapons tests    o Determine the extent of the participants' exposure to ionizing  radiation    o Provide public disclosure of information concerning participation by  military personnel in Project TRINITY.      METHODS AND SOURCES USED TO PREPARE THIS VOLUME    This report on Project TRINITY is based on historical and technical  documents associated with the detonation of the first nuclear device  on 16 July 1945.  The Department of Defense compiled information for  this volume from documents that record the scientific activities  during Project TRINITY.  These records, most of which were developed  by participants in TRINITY, are kept in several document repositories  throughout the United States.    In compiling information for this report, historians, health  physicists, radiation specialists, and information analysts canvassed  document repositories known to contain materials on atmospheric  nuclear weapons tests conducted in the southwestern United States.  These repositories included armed services libraries, Government  agency archives and libraries, Federal repositories, and libraries of  scientific and technical laboratories.  Researchers examined  classified and unclassified documents containing information on the  participation of personnel from the MED, which supervised Project  TRINITY, and from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), which  developed the TRINITY device.  After this initial effort, researchers  recorded relevant information concerning the activities of MED and  LASL personnel and catalogued the data sources.  Many of the documents  pertaining specifically to MED and LASL participation were found in  the Defense Nuclear Agency Technical Library and the LASL Records  Center.    Information on the fallout pattern, meteorological conditions, and  nuclear cloud dimensions is taken from Volume 1 of the General  Electric Company-TEMPO's \"Compilation of Local Fallout Data from Test  Detonations 1945-1962, Extracted from DASA 1251,\" unless more specific  information is available elsewhere.      ORGANIZATION OF THIS VOLUME    The following chapters detail MED and LASL participation in Project  TRINITY.  Chapter 1 provides background information, including a  description of the TRINITY test site.  Chapter 2 describes the  activities of MED and LASL participants before, during, and after the  detonation.  Chapter 3 discusses the radiological safety criteria and  procedures in effect for Project TRINITY, and chapter 4 presents the  results of the radiation monitoring program, including information on  film badge readings for participants in the project.    The information in this report is supplemented by the Reference  Manual: Background Materials for the CONUS Volumes.\" The manual  summarizes information on radiation physics, radiation health  concepts, exposure criteria, and measurement techniques.  It also  lists acronyms and includes a glossary of terms used in the DOD  reports addressing test events in the continental United States.            CHAPTER 1    INTRODUCTION      Project TRINITY was the name given to the war-time effort to produce  the first nuclear detonation.  A plutonium-fueled implosion device was  detonated on 16 July 1945 at the Alamogordo Bombing Range in  south-central New Mexico.    Three weeks later, on 6 August, the first uranium-fueled nuclear bomb,  a gun-type weapon code-named LITTLE BOY, was detonated over the  Japanese city of Hiroshima.  On 9 August, the FAT MAN nuclear bomb, a  plutonium-fueled implosion weapon identical to the TRINITY device, was  detonated over another Japanese city, Nagasaki.  Two days later, the  Japanese Government informed the United States of its decision to end  the war.  On 2 September 1945, the Japanese Empire officially  surrendered to the Allied Governments, bringing World War II to an  end.    In the years devoted to the development and construction of a nuclear  weapon, scientists and technicians expanded their knowledge of nuclear  fission and developed both the gun-type and the implosion mechanisms  to release the energy of a nuclear chain reaction.  Their knowledge,  however, was only theoretical.  They could be certain neither of the  extent and effects of such a nuclear chain reaction, nor of the  hazards of the resulting blast and radiation.  Protective measures  could be based only on estimates and calculations.  Furthermore,  scientists were reasonably confident that the gun-type uranium-fueled  device could be successfully detonated, but they did not know if the  more complex firing technology required in an implosion device would  work.  Successful detonation of the TRINITY device showed that  implosion would work, that a nuclear chain reaction would result in a  powerful detonation, and that effective means exist to guard against  the blast and radiation produced.      1.1  HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF PROJECT TRINITY    The development of a nuclear weapon was a low priority for the United  States before the outbreak of World War II.  However, scientists  exiled from Germany had expressed concern that the Germans were  developing a nuclear weapon.  Confirming these fears, in 1939 the  Germans stopped all sales of uranium ore from the mines of occupied  Czechoslovakia.  In a letter sponsored by group of concerned  scientists, Albert Einstein informed President Roosevelt that German  experiments had shown that an induced nuclear chain reaction was  possible and could be used to construct extremely powerful bombs (7;  12)*.     * All sources cited in the text are listed alphabetically in the   reference list at the end of this volume.  The number given in the   text corresponds to the number of the source document in the reference   list.    In response to the potential threat of a German nuclear weapon, the  United States sought a source of uranium to use in determining the  feasibility of a nuclear chain reaction.  After Germany occupied  Belgium in May 1940, the Belgians turned over uranium ore from their  holdings in the Belgian Congo to the United States.  Then, in March  1941, the element plutonium was isolated, and the plutonium-239  isotope was found to fission as readily as the scarce uranium isotope,  uranium-235.  The plutonium, produced in a uranium-fueled nuclear  reactor, provided the United States with an additional source of  material for nuclear weapons (7; 12).    In the summer of 1941, the British Government published a report  written by the Committee for Military Application of Uranium  Detonation (MAUD).  This report stated that a nuclear weapon was  possible and concluded that its construction should begin immediately.  The MAUD report, and to a lesser degree the discovery of plutonium,  encouraged American leaders to think more seriously about developing a  nuclear weapon.  On 6 December 1941, President Roosevelt appointed the  S-1 Committee to determine if the United States could construct a  nuclear weapon.  Six months later, the S-1 Committee gave the  President its report, recommending a fast-paced program that would  cost up to $100 million and that might produce the weapon by July 1944  (12).    The President accepted the S-1 Committee's recommendations.  The  effort to construct the weapon was turned over to the War Department,  which assigned the task to the Army Corps of Engineers.  In September  1942, the Corps of Engineers established the Manhattan Engineer  District to oversee the development of a nuclear weapon.  This effort  was code-named the \"Manhattan Project\" (12).    Within the next two years, the MED built laboratories and production  plants throughout the United States.  The three principal centers of  the Manhattan Project were the Hanford, Washington, Plutonium  Production Plant; the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, U-235 Production Plant;  and the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in northern New Mexico.  At  LASL, Manhattan Project scientists and technicians, directed by Dr. J.  Robert Oppenheimer,* investigated the theoretical problems that had to  be solved before a nuclear weapon could be developed (12).     * This report identifies by name only those LASL and MED personnel who   are well-known historical figures.    During the first two years of the Manhattan Project, work proceeded at  a slow but steady pace.  Significant technical problems had to be  solved, and difficulties in the production of plutonium, particularly  the inability to process large amounts, often frustrated the  scientists.  Nonetheless, by 1944 sufficient progress had been made to  persuade the scientists that their efforts might succeed.

Even when your chief  wants to see him he comes over to this side of the river. It is a pity  with such a man as he; and who was it that broke down his stalwart  strength? Why, those Melchite dogs; you may ask all along the Nile, long  as it is, who was at the bottom of any misfortune, and you will always  get the same answer: Wherever the Melchite or the Greek sets foot the  grass refuses to grow.\"    \"But the Mukaukas, the emperor's representative... the Arab began. The  Egyptian broke in however:    \"He, you think, must be safe from them? They did not certainly injure  his person; but they did worse, for when the Melchites rose up against  our party--it was at Alexandria, and the late Greek patriarch Cyrus  had a finger in that pie--they killed his two sons, two fine, splendid  men--killed them like dogs; and it crushed him completely.\"    \"Poor man!\" sighed the Arab. \"And has he no child left?\"    \"Oh, yes. One son, and the widow of his eldest. She went into a convent  after her husband's death, but she left her child, her little Mary--she  must be ten years old now--to live with her grandparents.\"    \"That is well,\" said the old man, \"that will bring some sunshine into  the house.\"    \"No doubt, Master. And just lately they have had some cause for  rejoicing. The only surviving son--Orion is his name--came home only the  day before yesterday from Constantinople where he has been for a long  time. There was a to-do! Half the city went crazy. Thousands went out to  meet him, as though he were the Saviour; they erected triumphal arches,  even folks of my creed--no one thought of hanging back. One and all  wanted to see the son of the great Mukaukas, and the women of course  were first and foremost!\"    \"You speak, however,\" said the Arab, \"as though the returning hero were  not worthy of so much honor.\"    \"That is as folks think,\" replied the Egyptian shrugging his shoulders.  \"At any rate he is the only son of the greatest man in the land.\"    \"But he does not promise to be like the old man?\"    \"Oh, yes, indeed,\" said the guide. \"My brother, a priest, and the head  of one of our great schools, was his tutor, and he never met such a  clever head as Orion's, he tells me. He learnt everything without any  trouble and at the same time worked as hard as a poor man's son. We may  expect him to win fame and honor--so Marcus says--for his parents and  for the city of Memphis: but for my part, I can see the shady side, and  I tell you the women will turn his head and bring him to a bad end. He  is handsome, taller even than the old man in his best days, and he knows  how to make the most of himself when he meets a pretty face--and pretty  faces are always to be met in his path...\"    \"And the young rascal takes what he finds!\" said the Moslem laughing.  \"If that is all you are alarmed at I am glad for the youth. He is young  and such things are allowable.\"    \"Nay, Sir, even my brother--he lives now in Alexandria, and is blind and  foolish enough still in all that concerns his former pupil--and even  he thinks this is a dangerous rock ahead. If he does not change in this  respect he will wander further and further from the law of the Lord,  and imperil his soul, for dangers surround him on all sides like roaring  lions. The noble gifts of a handsome and engaging person will lead him  to his ruin; and though I do not desire it, I suspect....\"    \"You look on the dark side and judge hardly,\" replied the old man. \"The  young....\"    \"Even the young, or at least the Christian young, ought to control  themselves, though I, if any one, am inclined to make the utmost  allowance for the handsome lad--nay, and I may confess: when he smiles  at me I feel at once as if I had met with some good-luck; and there are  a thousand other men in Memphis who feel the same, and still more the  women you may be sure--but many a one has shed bitter tears on his  account for all that.--But, by all the saints!--Talk of the wolf and you  see his tail! Look, there he is!--Halt! Stop a minute, you men; it is  worth while, Sir, to tarry a moment.\"    \"Is that his fine quadriga in front of the high garden gate yonder?\"    \"Those are the Pannonian horses he brought with him, as swift as  lightning and as.... But look! Ah, now they have disappeared behind the  hedge; but you, high up on your dromedary, must be able to see them. The  little maid by his side is the widow Susannah's daughter. This garden  and the beautiful mansion behind the trees belong to her.\"    \"A very handsome property!\" said the Arab.    \"I should think so indeed!\" replied the Memphite. \"The garden goes down  to the Nile, and then, what care is taken of it!\"    \"Was it not here that Philommon the corn-merchant lived formerly?\" asked  the old man, as though some memories were coming back to him.    \"To be sure. He was Susannah's husband and must have been a man of fifty  when he first wooed her. The little girl is their only child and the  richest heiress in the whole province; but she is not altogether grown  up though she is sixteen years old--an old man's child, you understand,  but a pretty, merry creature, a laughing dove in human form, and so  quick and lively. Her own people call her the little water-wagtail.\"    \"Good!--Good and very appropriate,\" said the merchant well pleased. \"She  is small too, a child rather than a maiden; but the graceful, gladsome  creature takes my fancy. And the governor's son--what is his name?\"    \"Orion, Sir,\" replied the guide.    \"And by my beard,\" said the old man smiling. \"You have not over-praised  him, man! Such a youth as this Orion is not to be seen every day. What  a tall fellow, and how becoming are those brown curls. Such as he are  spoilt to begin with by their mothers, and then all the other women  follow suit. And he has a frank, shrewd face with something behind it.  If only he had left his purple coat and gold frippery in Constantinople!  Such finery is out of place in this dismal ruinous city.\"    While he was yet speaking the Memphite urged his ass forward, but the  Arab held him back, for his attention was riveted by what was taking  place within the enclosure. He saw handsome Orion place a small white  dog, a silky creature of great beauty that evidently belonged to him--in  the little maiden's arms saw her kiss it and then put a blade of grass  round its neck as if to measure its size. The old man watched them as,  both laughing gaily, they looked into each other's eyes and presently  bid each other farewell. The girl stood on tiptoe in front of some rare  shrub to reach two exquisite purple flowers that blossomed at the top,  hastily plucked them and offered them to him with a deep blush; she  pushed away the hand he had put out to support her as she stretched  up for the flowers with a saucy slap; and a bright glance of happiness  lighted up her sweet face as the young man kissed the place her fingers  had hit, and then pressed the flowers to his lips. The old man looked on  with sympathetic pleasure, as though it roused the sweetest memories in  his mind; and his kind eyes shone as Orion, no less mischievously happy  than the young girl, whispered something in her ear; she drew the long  stem of grass out of her waist-belt to administer immediate and condign  punishment withal, struck it across his face, and then fled over  grass-plot and flower-bed, as swift as a roe, without heeding his  repeated shouts of \"Katharina! bewitching, big damsel, Katharina!\" till  she reached the house.    It was a charming little interlude. Old Haschim was still pondering it  in his memory with much satisfaction when he and his caravan had gone  some distance further. He felt obliged to Orion for this pretty scene,  and when he heard the young man's quadriga approaching at an easy trot  behind him, he turned round to gaze. But the Arab's face had lost its  contentment by the time the four Pannonians and the chariot, overlaid  with silver ornamentation and forming, with its driver, a picture of  rare beauty and in perfect taste, had slowly driven past, to fly on  like the wind as soon as the road was clear, and to vanish presently  in clouds of dust. There was something of melancholy in his voice as he  desired his young camel-driver to pick up the flowers, which now lay in  the dust of the road, and to bring them to him. He himself had observed  the handsome youth as, with a glance and a gesture of annoyance with  himself, he flung the innocent gift on the hot, sandy highway.    \"Your brother is right,\" cried the old man to the Memphite. \"Women are  indeed the rock ahead in this young fellow's life--and he in theirs, I  fear! Poor little girl!\"    \"The little water-wagtail do you mean? Oh! with her it may perhaps turn  to real earnest. The two mothers have settled the matter already. They  are both rolling in gold, and where doves nest doves resort.--Thank God,  the sun is low down over the Pyramids! Let your people rest at the  large inn yonder; the host is an honest man and lacks nothing, not even  shade!\"    \"So far as the beasts and drivers are concerned,\" said the merchant,  \"they may stop here. But I, and the leader of the caravan, and some of  my men will only take some refreshment, and then you must guide us to  the governor; I have to speak with him. It is growing late...\"    \"That does not matter,\" said the Egyptian. \"The Mukaukas prefers to  see strangers after sundown on such a scorching day. If you have any  dealings with him I am the very man for you. You have only to make  play with a gold piece and I can obtain you an audience at once through  Sebek, the house-steward he is my cousin. While you are resting here  I will ride on to the governor's palace and bring you word as to how  matters"]]]
