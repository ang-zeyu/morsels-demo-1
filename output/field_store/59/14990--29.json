In my opinion, cow protection societies may be considered cow  killing societies. It is a disgrace to us that we should need such  societies. When we forgot how to protect cows, I suppose we needed such  societies.    What am I to do when a blood-brother is on the point of killing a cow?  Am I to kill him, or to fall down at his feet and implore him? If you  admit that I should adopt the latter course I must do the same to my  Moslem brother. Who protects the cow from destruction by Hindus when  they cruelly ill-treat her? Whoever reasons with the Hindus when they  mercilessly belabour the progeny of the cow with their sticks? But this  has not prevented us from remaining one nation.    Lastly, if it be true that the Hindus believe in the doctrine of  non-killing, and the Mahomedans do not, what, I pray, is the duty of the  former? It is not written that a follower of the religion of Ahimsa  (non-killing) may kill a fellow-man. For him the way is straight. In  order to save one being, he may not kill another. He can only  plead--therein lies his sole duty.    But does every Hindu believe in Ahimsa? Going to the root of the matter,  not one man really practises such a religion, because we do destroy  life. We are said to follow that religion because we want to obtain  freedom from liability to kill any kind of life. Generally speaking, we  may observe that many Hindus partake of meat and are not, therefore,  followers of Ahimsa. It is, therefore, preposterous to suggest that the  two cannot live together amicably because the Hindus believe in Ahimsa  and the Mahomedans do not.    These thoughts are put into our minds by selfish and false religious  teachers. The English put the finishing touch. They have a habit of  writing history; they pretend to study the manners and customs of all  peoples, God has given us a limited mental capacity, but they usurp the  function of the Godhead and indulge in novel experiments. They write  about their own researches in most laudatory terms and hypnotise us into  believing them. We in our ignorance, then fall at their feet.    Those who do not wish to misunderstand things may read up the Koran, and  will find therein hundreds of passages acceptable to the Hindus; and the  Bhagavad Gita contains passages to which not a Mahomedan can take  exception. Am I to dislike a Mahomedan because there are passages in the  Koran I do not understand or like? It takes two to make a quarrel. If I  do not want to quarrel with a Mahomedan, the latter will be powerless to  foist a quarrel on me, and, similarly, I should be powerless if a  Mahomedan refuses his assistance to quarrel with me. An arm striking the  air will become disjointed. If everyone will try to understand the core  of his own religion and adhere to it, and will not allow false teachers  to dictate to him, there will be no room left for quarrelling.    READER: But, will the English ever allow the two bodies to join hands?    EDITOR: This question arises out of your timidity. It betrays our  shallowness. If two brothers want to live in peace, is it possible for a  third party to separate them? If they were to listen to evil counsels,  we would consider them to be foolish. Similarly, we Hindus and  Mahomedans would have to blame our folly rather than the English, if we  allowed them to put asunder. A clay pot would break through impact; if  not with one stone, thou with another. The way to save the pot is not to  keep it away from the danger point, but to bake it so that no stone  would break it. We have then to make our hearts of perfectly baked clay.  Then we shall be steeled against all danger. This can be easily done by  the Hindus. They are superior in numbers, they pretend that they are  more educated, they are, therefore, better able to shield themselves  from attack on their amicable relations with the Mahomedans.    There is a mutual distrust between the two communities. The Mahomedans,  therefore, ask for certain concessions from Lord Morley. Why should the  Hindus oppose this? If the Hindus desisted, the English would notice it,  the Mahomedans would gradually begin to trust the Hindus, and  brotherliness would be the outcome. We should be ashamed to take our  quarrels to the English. Everyone can find out for himself that the  Hindus can lose nothing be desisting. The man who has inspired  confidence in another has never lost anything in this world.    I do not suggest that the Hindus and the Mahomedans will never fight.  Two brothers living together often do so. We shall sometimes have our  heads broken. Such a thing ought not to be necessary, but all men are  not equi-minded. When people are in a rage, they do many foolish things.  These we have to put up with. But, when we do quarrel, we certainly do  not want to engage counsel and to resort to English or any law-courts.  Two men fight; both have their heads broken, or one only. How shall a  third party distribute justice amongst them? Those who fight may expect  to be injured.      HINDU-MAHOMEDAN UNITY    Mr. Candler some time ago asked me in an imaginary interview whether if  I was sincere in my professions of Hindu-Mahomedan Unity. I would eat  and drink with a Mahomedean and give my daughter in marriage to a  Mahomedan. This question has been asked again by some friends in another  form. Is it necessary for Hindu Mahomedan Unity that there should he  interdining and intermarrying? The questioners say that if the two are  necessary, real unity can never take place because crores of _Sanatanis_  would never reconcile themselves to interdining, much less to  intermarriage.    I am one of those who do not consider caste to be a harmful institution.  In its origin caste was a wholesome custom and promoted national  well-being. In my opinion the idea that interdining or intermarrying is  necessary for national growth, is a superstition borrowed from the West.  Eating is a process just as vital as the other sanitary necessities of  life. And if mankind had not, much to its harm, made of eating a fetish  and indulgence we would have performed the operation of eating in  private even as one performs the other necessary functions of life in  private. Indeed the highest culture in Hinduism regards eating in that  light and there are thousands of Hindus still living who will not eat  their food in the presence of anybody. I can recall the names of several  cultured men and women who ate their food in entire privacy but who  never had any illwill against anybody and who lived on the friendliest  terms with all.    Intermarriage is a still more difficult question. If brothers and  sisters can live on the friendliest footing without ever thinking of  marrying each other, I can see no difficulty in my daughter regarding  every Mahomedan brother and _vice versa_. I hold strong views on  religion and on marriage. The greater the restraint we exercise with  regard to our appetites whether about eating or marrying, the better we  become from a religious standpoint. I should despair of ever cultivating  amicable relations with the world, if I had to recognise the right or  the propriety of any young man offering his hand in marriage to my  daughter or to regard it as necessary for me to dine with anybody and  everybody. I claim that I am living on terms of friendliness with the  whole world. I have never quarrelled with a single Mahomedan or  Christian but for years I have taken nothing but fruit in Mahomedan or  Christian households. I would most certainly decline to eat food cooked  from the same plate with my son or to drink water out of a cup which his  lips have touched and which has not been washed. But the restraint or  the exclusiveness exercised in these matters by me has never affected  the closest companionship with the Mahomedan or the Christian friends  or my sons.    But interdining and intermarriage have never been a bar to disunion,  quarrels and worse. The Pandavas and the Kauravas flew at one another's  throats without compunction although they interdined and intermarried.  The bitterness between the English and the Germans has not yet died out.    The fact is that intermarriage and interdining are not necessary factors  in friendship and unity though they are often emblems thereof. But  insistence on either the one or the other can easily become and is  to-day a bar to Hindu-Mahomedan Unity. If we make ourselves believe that  Hindus and Mahomedans cannot be one unless they interdine or intermarry,  we would be creating an artificial barrier between us which it might be  almost impossible to remove. And it would seriously interfere with the  flowing unity between Hindus and Mahomedans if, for example, Mahomedan  youths consider it lawful to court Hindu girls. The Hindu parents will  not, even if they suspected any such thing, freely admit Mahomedans to  their homes as they have begun to do now. In my opinion it is necessary  for Hindu and Mahomedan young men to recognise this limitation.    I hold it to be utterly impossible for Hindus and Mahomedans to  intermarry and yet retain intact each other's religion. And the true  beauty of Hindu-Mahomedan Unity lies in each remaining true to his own  religion and yet being true to each other. For, we are thinking of  Hindus and Mahomedans even of the most orthodox type being able to  regard one another as natural friends instead of regarding one another  as natural enemies as they have done hitherto.    What then does the Hindu-Mahomedan Unity consist in and how can it be  best promoted? The answer is simple. It consists in our having a common  purpose, a common goal and common sorrows. It is best promoted by  co-operating to reach the common goal, by sharing one another's sorrow  and by mutual toleration. A common goal we have. We wish this great  country of ours to be greater and self-governing.[4] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#20)"],[1,"and told  this to the people, and our Lord bade them to sanctify the people this  day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes, and be ready the  third day. The third day our Lord shall descend tofore all the people on  the mount of Sinai. And ordain to the people the marks and terms in the  circuit. And say to them: Beware that ye ascend not on the hill ne touch  the ends of it. Whosoever touched the hill shall die by death, there  shall no hand touch him, but with stones he shall be oppressed and with  casting of them on him he shall be tolben; whether it be man or beast,  he shall not live. When thou hearest the trump blown then ascend to the  hill. Moses went down to the people and sanctified and hallowed them,  and when they had washen their clothes he said to them: Be ye ready at  the third day and approach not your wives; When the third day came, and  the morning waxed clear, they heard thunder and lightning and saw a  great cloud cover the mount, and the cry of the trump was so shrill that  the people were sore afraid. When Moses had brought them forth unto the  root of the hill they stood there. All the mount of Sinai smoked, for so  much as our Lord descended on it in fire, and the smoke ascended from  the hill as it had been from a furnace. The mount was terrible and  dreadful, and the sound of the trump grew a little more and continued  longer. Moses spake and our Lord answered him. Our Lord descended upon  the top of the mount of Sinai, even on the top of it, and called Moses  to him, which when he came said to him: Go down and charge the people  that they come not to the terms of the hill for to see the Lord, for if  they do, much multitude shall perish of them. The priests that shall  come let them be sanctified lest they be smitten down. And thou and  Aaron shall ascend the hill. All the people and priests let them not  pass their bounds lest God smite them. Then Moses descended and told to  the people all that our Lord hath said. After this our Lord called Moses  and said: I am the Lord God that brought you out of Egypt and of  thraldom. And gave him the Commandment first by speaking and many  ceremonies as be rehearsed in the Bible, which is not requisite to be  written here, but the ten commandments every man is bounden to know. And  ere Moses received them written, he went up into the mount of Sinai, and  fasted there forty days and forty nights ere he received them. In which  time he commanded him to make many things, and to ordain the laws and  ceremonies which now be not had in the new law. And also as doctors say,  Moses learned that time all the histories tofore written of the making  of heaven and earth, of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and of Joseph  with his brethren. And at last delivered to him two tables of stone,  both written with the hand of God, which follow.      The first commandment that God commanded is this. Thou shalt not worship  no strange ne diverse gods.    The second commandment is this, that thou shalt not take the name of  God in vain, that is to say, thou shalt not swear by him for nothing.    The third commandment is that thou have mind and remember that thou  hallow and keep holy thy Sabbath day or Sunday. These three commandments  be written in the first table and appertain only to God.    The fourth commandment is that thou shalt honor and worship thy father  and mother, for thou shalt live the longer on earth.    The fifth commandment is that thou shalt slay no man.    The sixth commandment is, thou shalt not do adultery.    The seventh commandment is that thou shalt do no theft.    The eighth commandment is that thou shalt not bear false witness against  thy neighbor.    The ninth commandment is that thou shalt not desire the wife of thy  neighbor, nor shalt not covet her in thine heart.    The tenth commandment is that thou shalt not covet nothing that is, or  longeth to, thy neighbor.      These be the ten commandments of our Lord, of which the three first  belong to God, and the seven other be ordained for our neighbors. Every  person that hath wit and understanding in himself, and age, is bound to  know them and to obey and keep these ten commandments aforesaid or else  he sinneth deadly.    Thus Moses abode in the hill forty days and forty nights and received  of Almighty God the tables with the commandments written with the hand  of God; and also received and learned many ceremonies and statutes that  God ordained, by which the children of Israel should be ruled and  judged. And whiles that Moses was thus with our Lord on the mount, the  children of Israel saw that he tarried and descended not, and some of  them said that he was dead or gone away, and would not return again, and  some said nay; but in conclusion they gathered them together against  Aaron, and said to him: Make to us some gods that may go tofore us, we  know not what is befallen to Moses. Then Aaron said: Take the gold that  hangeth in the ears of your wives and your children, and bring it to me.  The people did as he bade, and brought the gold to Aaron, which he took  and molt it and made thereof a calf. Then they said: These be thy gods,  Israel, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Then the people made  an altar tofore it, and made great joy and mirth, and danced and played  tofore the calf, and offered and made sacrifices thereto. Our Lord spake  to Moses, saying: Go hence and descend down, thy people have sinned whom  thou hast brought forth from the land of Egypt. They have soon forsaken  and left the way which thou hast showed to them. They have made to them  a calf blown, and they have worshipped it, and offered sacrifices  thereto, saying: These be thy gods, Israel, that have brought thee out  of the land of Egypt, Yet said our Lord to Moses: I see well that this  people is of evil disposition, suffer me that I may wreak my wrath on  them, and I shall destroy them. I shall make thee governor of great  people.    Moses then prayed our Lord God saying: Why art thou wroth, Lord, against  thy people that thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt in a great  strength and a boisterous hand? I beseech thee, Lord, let not the  Egyptians say that their God hath locked them out for to slay them in  the mountains. I pray thee Lord that thy wrath may assuage, and be thou  pleased and benign upon the wickedness of thy people. Remember Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob thy servants, to whom thou promisedst and swaredst by  thyself saying: I shall multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and  the universal, land of which I have spoken I shall give to your seed,  and ye shall possess and have it ever. And with these words our Lord was  pleased that he would do no harm as he had said unto his people; and  Moses returned from the mount, bearing two tables of stone, written both  with the hand of God. And the scripture that was in the tables were the  ten commandments as fore be written. Joshua hearing the great noise of  the children of Israel said to Moses: I trow they fight beneath, which  answered and said: It is no cry of exhorting men to fight, ne noise to  compel me to flee, but I hear the noise of singing. When he approached  to them he saw the calf and the instruments of mirth, and he was so  wroth that he threw down the tables and brake them at the foot of the  hill, and ran and caught down the calf that they had made, and burnt  and smote it all to powder, which he cast into water and gave it to  drink to the children of Israel. Then said Moses to Aaron: What hath  this people done to thee that thou hast made to sin grievously? To whom  he answered: Let not my lord take none indignation at me, thou knowest  well that this people is prone and ready to sin. They said to me: Make  us gods that may go tofore us; we know not what is fallen to this Moses  that led us out of Egypt. To whom I said: Who of you that hath gold give  it me; they took and gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and  thereof came out this calf. And then said Moses: All they that be of  God's part and have not sinned in this calf let them join to me; and the  children of Levi joined to him, and he bade each man take a sword on his  side and take vengeance and slay every each his brother, friend, and his  neighbor that have trespassed. And so the children of Levi went and slew  thirty-three thousand of the children of Israel. And then said Moses: Ye  have hallowed this day your hands unto our Lord, and ye shall be  therefore blessed. The second day Moses spake to the people and said: Ye  have committed and done the greatest sin that may be. I shall ascend  unto our Lord again, and shall pray him for your sin. Then Moses  ascended again, and received afterward two tables again, which our Lord  bade him make. And therein our Lord wrote the commandments. And after,  our Lord commanded him to make an ark and a tabernacle: in which ark was  kept three things. First the rod with which he did marvels, a pot full  of manna, and the two tables with commandments. And then after Moses  taught them the law; how each man should behave him against other and  what he should do, and what he should not do, and departed them into  twelve tribes, and commanded that every man should bring a rod into the  Tabernacle. And Moses wrote each name on the rod, and Moses shut fast  the tabernacle. And on the morn there was found one of the rods that  burgeoned and bare leaves and fruit, and was of an almond tree. That rod  fell to Aaron.    And after this, long time, the children desired to eat flesh and  remembered of the flesh that they ate in Egypt, and grudged against  Moses, and would have ordained to them a duke for to have returned into  Egypt. Wherefore Moses was so woe that he desired of our Lord to deliver  him from this life, because he saw them so unkind against God. Then God  sent to them so great plenty of curlews that two days and one night they  flew so thick by the ground that they took great number, for "]]]
