"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#2)"],[1,"romantic spirit before the time of Apollonius in writings that have  perished, for instance, in those of Antimachus of Colophon, but the  \"Argonautica\" is perhaps the first poem still extant in which the  expression of this spirit is developed with elaboration. The Medea of  Apollonius is the direct precursor of the Dido of Virgil, and it is the  pathos and passion of the fourth book of the \"Aeneid\" that keep alive  many a passage of Apollonius.          THE ARGONAUTICA          BOOK I    (ll. 1-4) Beginning with thee, O Phoebus, I will recount the famous  deeds of men of old, who, at the behest of King Pelias, down through the  mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks, sped well-benched Argo in  quest of the golden fleece.    (ll. 5-17) Such was the oracle that Pelias heard, that a hateful doom  awaited him to be slain at the prompting of the man whom he should  see coming forth from the people with but one sandal. And no long time  after, in accordance with that true report, Jason crossed the stream  of wintry Anaurus on foot, and saved one sandal from the mire, but the  other he left in the depths held back by the flood. And straightway he  came to Pelias to share the banquet which the king was offering to his  father Poseidon and the rest of the gods, though he paid no honour to  Pelasgian Hera. Quickly the king saw him and pondered, and devised for  him the toil of a troublous voyage, in order that on the sea or among  strangers he might lose his home-return.    (ll. 18-22) The ship, as former bards relate, Argus wrought by the  guidance of Athena. But now I will tell the lineage and the names of the  heroes, and of the long sea-paths and the deeds they wrought in their  wanderings; may the Muses be the inspirers of my song!    (ll. 23-34) First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope bare, it  is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian height. Men say  that he by the music of his songs charmed the stubborn rocks upon the  mountains and the course of rivers. And the wild oak-trees to this day,  tokens of that magic strain, that grow at Zone on the Thracian shore,  stand in ordered ranks close together, the same which under the charm of  his lyre he led down from Pieria. Such then was Orpheus whom Aeson's  son welcomed to share his toils, in obedience to the behest of Cheiron,  Orpheus ruler of Bistonian Pieria.    (ll. 35-39) Straightway came Asterion, whom Cometes begat by the waters  of eddying Apidanus; he dwelt at Peiresiae near the Phylleian mount,  where mighty Apidanus and bright Enipeus join their streams, coming  together from afar.    (ll. 40-44) Next to them from Larisa came Polyphemus, son of Eilatus,  who aforetime among the mighty Lapithae, when they were arming  themselves against the Centaurs, fought in his younger days; now his  limbs were grown heavy with age, but his martial spirit still remained,  even as of old.    (ll. 45-48) Nor was Iphiclus long left behind in Phylace, the uncle  of Aeson's son; for Aeson had wedded his sister Alcimede, daughter of  Phylacus: his kinship with her bade him be numbered in the host.    (ll. 49-50) Nor did Admetus, the lord of Pherae rich in sheep, stay  behind beneath the peak of the Chalcodonian mount.    (ll. 51-56) Nor at Alope stayed the sons of Hermes, rich in corn-land,  well skilled in craftiness, Erytus and Echion, and with them on their  departure their kinsman Aethalides went as the third; him near the  streams of Amphrysus Eupolemeia bare, the daughter of Myrmidon, from  Phthia; the two others were sprung from Antianeira, daughter of Menetes.    (ll. 57-64) From rich Gyrton came Coronus, son of Caeneus, brave, but  not braver than his father. For bards relate that Caeneus though still  living perished at the hands of the Centaurs, when apart from other  chiefs he routed them; and they, rallying against him, could neither  bend nor slay him; but unconquered and unflinching he passed beneath the  earth, overwhelmed by the downrush of massy pines.    (ll. 65-68) There came too Titaresian Mopsus, whom above all men the son  of Leto taught the augury of birds; and Eurydamas the son of Ctimenus;  he dwelt at Dolopian Ctimene near the Xynian lake.    (ll. 69-70) Moreover Actor sent his son Menoetius from Opus that he  might accompany the chiefs.    (ll. 71-76) Eurytion followed and strong Eribotes, one the son of  Teleon, the other of Irus, Actor's son; the son of Teleon renowned  Eribotes, and of Irus Eurytion. A third with them was Oileus, peerless  in courage and well skilled to attack the flying foe, when they break  their ranks.    (ll. 77-85) Now from Euboea came Canthus eager for the quest, whom  Canethus son of Abas sent; but he was not destined to return to  Cerinthus. For fate had ordained that he and Mopsus, skilled in the  seer's art, should wander and perish in the furthest ends of Libya. For  no ill is too remote for mortals to incur, seeing that they buried them  in Libya, as far from the Colchians as is the space that is seen between  the setting and the rising of the sun.    (ll. 86-89) To him Clytius and Iphitus joined themselves, the warders  of Oechalia, sons of Eurytus the ruthless, Eurytus, to whom the  Far-shooting god gave his bow; but he had no joy of the gift; for of his  own choice he strove even with the giver.    (ll. 90-94) After them came the sons of Aeacus, not both together, nor  from the same spot; for they settled far from Aegina in exile, when in  their folly they had slain their brother Phoeus. Telamon dwelt in the  Attic island; but Peleus departed and made his home in Phthia.    (ll. 95-104) After them from Cecropia came warlike Butes, son of brave  Teleon, and Phalerus of the ashen spear. Alcon his father sent him  forth; yet no other sons had he to care for his old age and livelihood.  But him, his well-beloved and only son, he sent forth that amid bold  heroes he might shine conspicuous. But Theseus, who surpassed all the  sons of Erechtheus, an unseen bond kept beneath the land of Taenarus,  for he had followed that path with Peirithous; assuredly both would have  lightened for all the fulfilment of their toil.    (ll. 105-114) Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left the Siphaean people of the  Thespians, well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the broad sea,  and well skilled to infer from sun and star the stormy winds and the  time for sailing. Tritonian Athena herself urged him to join the band  of chiefs, and he came among them a welcome comrade. She herself too  fashioned the swift ship; and with her Argus, son of Arestor, wrought  it by her counsels. Wherefore it proved the most excellent of all ships  that have made trial of the sea with oars.    (ll. 115-117) After them came Phlias from Araethyrea, where he dwelt  in affluence by the favour of his father Dionysus, in his home by the  springs of Asopus.    (ll. 118-121) From Argos came Talaus and Areius, sons of Bias, and  mighty Leodocus, all of whom Pero daughter of Neleus bare; on her  account the Aeolid Melampus endured sore affliction in the steading of  Iphiclus.    (ll. 122-132) Nor do we learn that Heracles of the mighty heart  disregarded the eager summons of Aeson's son. But when he heard a report  of the heroes' gathering and had reached Lyrceian Argos from Arcadia by  the road along which he carried the boar alive that fed in the thickets  of Lampeia, near the vast Erymanthian swamp, the boar bound with chains  he put down from his huge shoulders at the entrance to the market-place  of Mycenae; and himself of his own will set out against the purpose of  Eurystheus; and with him went Hylas, a brave comrade, in the flower of  youth, to bear his arrows and to guard his bow.    (ll. 133-138) Next to him came a scion of the race of divine Danaus,  Nauplius. He was the son of Clytonaeus son of Naubolus; Naubolus was son  of Lernus; Lernus we know was the son of Proetus son of Nauplius; and  once Amymone daughter of Danaus, wedded to Poseidon, bare Nauplius, who  surpassed all men in naval skill.    (ll. 139-145) Idmon came last of all them that dwelt at Argos, for  though he had learnt his own fate by augury, he came, that the people  might not grudge him fair renown. He was not in truth the son of Abas,  but Leto's son himself begat him to be numbered among the illustrious  Aeolids; and himself taught him the art of prophecy--to pay heed to  birds and to observe the signs of the burning sacrifice.    (ll. 146-150) Moreover Aetolian Leda sent from Sparta strong Polydeuces  and Castor, skilled to guide swift-footed steeds; these her dearly-loved  sons she bare at one birth in the house of Tyndareus; nor did she forbid  their departure; for she had thoughts worthy of the bride of Zeus.    (ll. 151-155) The sons of Aphareus, Lynceus and proud Idas, came from  Arene, both exulting in their great strength; and Lynceus too excelled  in keenest sight, if the report is true that that hero could easily  direct his sight even beneath the earth.    (ll. 156-160) And with them Neleian Periclymenus set out to come, eldest  of all the sons of godlike Neleus who were born at Pylos; Poseidon had  given him boundless strength and granted him that whatever shape he  should crave during the fight, that he should take in the stress of  battle.    (ll. 161-171) Moreover from Arcadia came Amphidamas and Cepheus, who  inhabited Tegea and the allotment of Apheidas, two sons of Aldus; and  Ancaeus followed them as the third, whom his father Lycurgus sent, the  brother older than both. But he was left in the city to care for Aleus  now growing old, while he gave his son to join his brothers. Antaeus  went clad in the skin of a Maenalian bear, and wielding in his right  hand a huge two-edged battleaxe. For his armour his grandsire had hidden  in the house's innermost recess, to see if he might by some means still  stay his departure.    (ll. 172-175) There came also Augeias, whom fame declared to be the  son of Helios; he reigned over the Eleans,"]]]
