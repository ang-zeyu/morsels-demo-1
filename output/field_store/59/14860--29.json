[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7001"],[0,"History of the Philippine Islands (#2)"],[1,", the  regulation of trade, various pacifications, the rebuilding of Manila,  and the opening of negotiations with Japan, are all a part of his  administration, and he is the inspirer of them all. The first note  to the future expeditions to, and troubles with, Camboja and Siam is  struck by an embassy from the first country in charge of Diego Belloso  with offers of trade and friendship and requests for aid against Siam,  the latter being at the time deferred. In accordance with his great  desire to conquer Ternate, the governor fits out a great fleet in  1593, sending the advance vessels to the Pintados in care of his  son. Shortly after, leaving the city in charge of Diego Ronquillo,  although with too few troops for defense, Gomez Perez sets out to  join his son, but is assassinated by his Chinese rowers, who mutiny  and make off with the galley. After his death, the contests for his  office begin, for the dead governor had assured various people that  they would be appointed in case of his death. Especially had he done  this with Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, a wealthy man of the Pintados,  to whom he \"had shown an appointment drawn in his favor.\" In Manila,  Pedro de Rojas, lieutenant-assessor, is chosen governor ad interim,  but after forty days Luis Perez Dasmariñas takes the office by  virtue of an appointment regularly drawn in his favor. The return  of the troops to Manila proves an efficacious relief from fears of  a Chinese invasion. The vessels sent to Nueva España in 1593 fail  to make the voyage because of stormy weather, but the governor's  death is learned in Spain by way of India. The troubles between the  bishop and governor culminate somewhat before the latter's death,  in the departure of the former for Spain, as a result of which an  archbishopric with suffragan bishops is established in the islands,  and the Audiencia is reëstablished. The office of lieutenant-assessor  is given more weight and Morga is sent out to fill it in 1595 under  its changed title of lieutenant-governor. In the administration of  Luis Perez Dasmariñas affairs begin actively with Camboja through  the expedition despatched under Juan Xuarez Gallinato, and Blas Ruiz  de Hernan Gonzalez and Diego Belloso. The governor, completely under  the influence of the Dominicans, although against the advice of the  \"majority of people in the city\" sends a fleet to Camboja. Gallinato  fails to reach that country until after Blas Ruiz and Belloso have  quarreled with the Chinese there, killed the usurping Cambodian king,  Anacaparan, and thrown the country into confusion. Much to their  displeasure Gallinato refuses to continue the conquest, chides the  others harshly, and departs for Manila by way of Cochinchina. At  Cochinchina Blas Ruiz and Belloso go to the kingdom of Lao to find  the legitimate king of Camboja, Prauncar. On their arrival they find  that he has died, but partly through their efforts and those of  two Malays, the king's younger son, who still survives, is placed  on the throne. Gallinato experiences difficulty in Cochinchina,  where he endeavors to regain the standard and various other articles  from the galley of Gomez Perez that had been stolen by the Chinese,  but finally returns safely to Manila. Meanwhile Estevan Rodriguez de  Figueroa agrees to subdue Mindanao at his own expense, in return for  which he is to have its governorship for two generations. In pursuance  of this he fits out a large expedition, but shortly after reaching  the island is killed in a fight and ambush, whereupon his first  commanding officer Juan de la Xara schemes to continue the expedition,  and establishes his men in a settlement near Tampacan, called Murcia.    The administration of Governor Francisco Tello forms the subject-matter  of chapter VI. At his arrival in 1596, news is received in the island  of the appointment of Fray Ignacio de Santibañez as archbishop,  and of two appointments for bishops. News of the death of Estevan  Rodriguez is brought to Manila, and the machinations of Juan de la  Xara to carry on the expedition independently of Manila learned. His  death shortly after arrest, while on his way to Oton to push his suit  with Rodriguez's widow, frustrates his plans. Juan Ronquillo is sent  to Mindanao and takes over the command there, but being discouraged  by the outlook advises an evacuation of the river of Mindanao and the  fortifying of La Caldera, on the Mindanao coast. However he gains a  complete victory over the combined forces of Mindanaos and Ternatans,  which causes him to send another despatch to Tello. But the latter's  reply to the first despatch having been received, in accordance with  its orders he burns his fort, and after establishing a garrison at  La Caldera, returns to Manila with the rest of his command. There  he is arrested for not awaiting Tello's second despatch, but is  liberated on producing a letter ordering him in any event to return  to Manila. Gallinato, on his return from Cochinchina is accused by  his own men of not following up the victory at Camboja, for had  he done so, \"all that had been hoped in that kingdom would have  been attained.\" An incipient rebellion in Cagayan is checked by the  murder of its leader by his own countrymen \"who had offered to do it  for a reward.\" In the year 1596, the remnants of Alvaro de Mendaña  de Neira's expedition that had set out from Peru to rediscover the  Solomon Islands reaches the Philippines after great sufferings from  famine and disease, and after the death of many men, among them the  commander himself. The voyage is related in detail in a letter from  the chief pilot, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros to Morga; it is full of  stirring adventure, and of keen and appreciative observation. One of  the vessels, the \"San Geronymo\" despatched to Nueva España in 1596,  is forced to put in at a Japanese port because of storms. There they  receive ill-treatment, and the efforts of the Franciscan missionaries  in Japan in their behalf lead to the edict sentencing them to death,  in accordance with which six Franciscans, three Jesuits, and seventeen  native helpers are crucified in 1597. Taicosama's wrath, intensified by  the accusation that the Spaniards conquered kingdoms \"by first sending  their religious to the kingdom\" and by entering afterward \"with their  arms,\" is satisfied by the crucifixion of the religious and their  assistants, and the men of the \"San Geronymo\" are allowed to return to  Manila. The religious write a letter of farewell to Dr. Morga, in which  they inform him that Japan intends to attack the Philippines. Luis  Navarrete Fajardo is sent to Japan to demand satisfaction, but  accomplishes little. Faranda Quiemon, one of Taicosama's vassals,  a man of obscure birth, obtaining permission to make an expedition of  conquest, sets about his preparations, but owing to lack of resources  and initiative fails to complete them. Meanwhile great caution is  exercised in Manila, and the Japanese residing there are sent back  to Japan, while those coming on trading vessels are well treated but  gotten rid of as soon as possible. Cambodian affairs are again set on  foot, although against the advice of some, through the instrumentality  of Father Alonso Ximenez, a Dominican who had accompanied Gallinato  on the former expedition, but who had been left behind at Cochinchina  through his own disobedience of orders. Affairs in Mindanao and Jolo  assume a threatening aspect. One Juan Pacho, commander of La Caldera,  is killed in an incursion into Jolo with twenty of his men, and a new  commander of La Caldera is appointed until a punitive expedition can be  undertaken. In 1598 the archbishop arrives, and the Manila Audiencia  is reëstablished by royal order, and the seal received with great  pomp and ceremony. A letter received that same year by Morga from  Blas Ruiz details events in Camboja since he and Belloso went there  with Gallinato's expedition. Blas Ruiz seeks to excuse their actions  in Camboja and holds out the hope of Spanish conquest and influence  on the mainland, and asks help from the islands. As a consequence  of this letter, Luis Perez Dasmariñas secures permission to attempt  an expedition to the mainland at his own expense to aid the king of  Camboja and then to seize the kingdom of Champan, whose king was a  constant menace to all navigators throughout that region. Negotiations  with China and the granting of an open port to Spaniards called El  Pinal, are opened and secured through the efforts of Juan de Zamudio  who is sent to China for saltpeter and metals, although with great and  vindictive opposition from the Portuguese, who fear the loss of their  own trade at Macao. At El Pinal the survivors of two of Luis Perez's  three ships meet with Juan de Zamudio, after suffering great storms,  hardships, and wrecks. The same favor is extended him by the Chinese  as to Zamudio, but the Portuguese show their hostility to him also,  imprisoning the men sent by him to Macao to ask for help, and even  attempting force against him. Both Zamudio and a messenger from Luis  Perez carry news of the latter's disaster to Manila, whereupon a ship  and supplies are sent him with orders to return to Manila. Hernando  de los Rios Coronel, sent to Canton by Luis Perez to negotiate with  the Chinese, writes from that city to Dr. Morga concerning China and  the possibility, desirability, and advantages of the Chinese trade in  China instead of Manila, and the opposition of the Portuguese. China  he describes as a country \"full of rivers and towns, and without  a palmo of ground left lying idle.\" Meanwhile the third vessel of  Luis Perez's fleet, commanded by Luis Ortiz, reaches Camboja, where  he and his companions join the Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese  already there. This small force, which is eyed askance by the Malay  leaders and others envious of, and hostile to them on account of their  prowess and their influence with the weak"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary — Complete (#2)"],[1," calling. The class had, intact, some privileges. A lodging, such as  it was, was readily granted to them in some of the out-houses, and the  usual awmous (alms) of a handful of meal (called a gowpen) was scarce  denied by the poorest cottager. The mendicant disposed these, according  to their different quality, in various bags around his person, and thus  carried about with him the principal part of his sustenance, which he  literally received for the asking. At the houses of the gentry, his  cheer was mended by scraps of broken meat, and perhaps a Scottish  \"twalpenny,\" or English penny, which was expended in snuff or whiskey.  In fact, these indolent peripatetics suffered much less real hardship  and want of food, than the poor peasants from whom they received alms.    If, in addition to his personal qualifications, the mendicant chanced to  be a King's Bedesman, or Blue-Gown, he belonged, in virtue thereof,  to the aristocracy of his order, and was esteemed a parson of great  importance.    These Bedesmen are an order of paupers to whom the Kings of Scotland  were in the custom of distributing a certain alms, in conformity with  the ordinances of the Catholic Church, and who were expected in return  to pray for the royal welfare and that of the state. This order is still  kept up. Their number is equal to the number of years which his Majesty  has lived; and one Blue-Gown additional is put on the roll for every  returning royal birth-day. On the same auspicious era, each Bedesman  receives a new cloak, or gown of coarse cloth, the colour light blue,  with a pewter badge, which confers on them the general privilege of  asking alms through all Scotland,--all laws against sorning, masterful  beggary, and every other species of mendicity, being suspended in favour  of this privileged class. With his cloak, each receives a leathern  purse, containing as many shillings Scots (videlicet, pennies sterling)  as the sovereign is years old; the zeal of their intercession for the  king's long life receiving, it is to be supposed, a great stimulus  from their own present and increasing interest in the object of their  prayers. On the same occasion one of the Royal Chaplains preaches a  sermon to the Bedesmen, who (as one of the reverend gentlemen expressed  himself) are the most impatient and inattentive audience in the world.  Something of this may arise from a feeling on the part of the Bedesmen,  that they are paid for their own devotions, not for listening to those  of others. Or, more probably, it arises from impatience, natural, though  indecorous in men bearing so venerable a character, to arrive at the  conclusion of the ceremonial of the royal birth-day, which, so far as  they are concerned, ends in a lusty breakfast of bread and ale; the  whole moral and religious exhibition terminating in the advice of  Johnson's \"Hermit hoar\" to his proselyte,                       Come, my lad, and drink some beer.    Of the charity bestowed on these aged Bedesmen in money and clothing,  there are many records in the Treasurer's accompts. The following  extract, kindly supplied by Mr. Macdonald of the Register House, may  interest those whose taste is akin to that of Jonathan Oldbuck of  Monkbarns. BLEW GOWNIS.        In the Account of Sir Robert Melvill of Murdocarney,      Treasurer-Depute of King James VI., there are the following Payments:--                                  \"Junij 1590.        \"Item, to Mr. Peter Young, Elimosinar, twentie four gownis of blew      clayth, to be gevin to xxiiij auld men, according to the yeiris of his      hienes age, extending to viii xx viii elnis clayth; price of the elne      xxiiij s.

Having thus given an account of the genus and species to which Edie  Ochiltree appertains, the author may add, that the individual he had  in his eye was Andrew Gemmells, an old mendicant of the character  described, who was many years since well known, and must still be  remembered, in the vales of Gala, Tweed, Ettrick, Yarrow, and the  adjoining country.    The author has in his youth repeatedly seen and conversed with Andrew,  but cannot recollect whether he held the rank of Blue-Gown. He was a  remarkably fine old figure, very tall, and maintaining a soldierlike  or military manner and address. His features were intelligent, with a  powerful expression of sarcasm. His motions were always so graceful,  that he might almost have been suspected of having studied them; for  he might, on any occasion, have, served as a model for an artist, so  remarkably striking were his ordinary attitudes. Andrew Gemmells had  little of the cant of his calling; his wants were food and shelter, or  a trifle of money, which he always claimed, and seemed to receive as his  due. He, sung a good song, told a good story, and could crack a severe  jest with all the acumen of Shakespeare's jesters, though without using,  like them, the cloak of insanity. It was some fear of Andrew's satire,  as much as a feeling of kindness or charity, which secured him the  general good reception which he enjoyed everywhere. In fact, a jest of  Andrew Gemmells, especially at the expense of a person of consequence,  flew round the circle which he frequented, as surely as the bon-mot of  a man of established character for wit glides through the fashionable  world, Many of his good things are held in remembrance, but are  generally too local and personal to be introduced here.    Andrew had a character peculiar to himself among his tribe for aught I  ever heard. He was ready and willing to play at cards or dice with any  one who desired such amusement. This was more in the character of the  Irish itinerant gambler, called in that country a \"carrow,\" than of the  Scottish beggar. But the late Reverend Doctor Robert Douglas, minister  of Galashiels, assured the author, that the last time he saw Andrew  Gemmells, he was engaged in a game at brag with a gentleman of fortune,  distinction, and birth. To preserve the due gradations of rank, the  party was made at an open window of the chateau, the laird sitting on  his chair in the inside, the beggar on a stool in the yard; and they  played on the window-sill. The stake was a considerable parcel of  silver. The author expressing some surprise, Dr. Douglas observed, that  the laird was no doubt a humourist or original; but that many decent  persons in those times would, like him, have thought there was  nothing extraordinary in passing an hour, either in card-playing or  conversation, with Andrew Gemmells.    This singular mendicant had generally, or was supposed to have, much  money about his person, as would have been thought the value of his life  among modern foot-pads. On one occasion, a country gentleman, generally  esteemed a very narrow man, happening to meet Andrew, expressed great  regret that he had no silver in his pocket, or he would have given him  sixpence.--\"I can give you change for a note, laird,\" replied Andrew.    Like most who have arisen to the head of their profession, the modern  degradation which mendicity has undergone was often the subject of  Andrew's lamentations. As a trade, he said, it was forty pounds a-year  worse since he had first practised it. On another occasion he observed,  begging was in modern times scarcely the profession of a gentleman; and  that, if he had twenty sons, he would not easily be induced to breed one  of them up in his own line. When or where this laudator temporis acti  closed his wanderings, the author never heard with certainty; but most  probably, as Burns says,                       --he died a cadger-powny's death,                            At some dike side."]]]
