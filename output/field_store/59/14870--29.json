Those old mates of our father's are getting few and far between, and  only happen along once in a way to keep the old man's memory fresh, as  it were. We met one to-day, and had a yarn with him, and afterwards we  got thinking, and somehow began to wonder whether those ancient friends  of ours were, or were not, better and kinder to their mates than we of  the rising generation are to our fathers; and the doubt is painfully on  the wrong side.          SETTLING ON THE LAND      The worst bore in Australia just now is the man who raves about getting  the people on the land, and button-holes you in the street with a little  scheme of his own. He generally does not know what he is talking about.    There is in Sydney a man named Tom Hopkins who settled on the land once,  and sometimes you can get him to talk about it. He did very well at his  trade in the city, years ago, until he began to think that he could do  better up-country. Then he arranged with his sweetheart to be true to  him and wait whilst he went west and made a home. She drops out of the  story at this point.    He selected on a run at Dry Hole Creek, and for months awaited the  arrival of the government surveyors to fix his boundaries; but they  didn't come, and, as he had no reason to believe they would turn up  within the next ten years, he grubbed and fenced at a venture, and  started farming operations.    Does the reader know what grubbing means? Tom does. He found the  biggest, ugliest, and most useless trees on his particular piece of  ground; also the greatest number of adamantine stumps. He started  without experience, or with very little, but with plenty of advice  from men who knew less about farming than he did. He found a soft  place between two roots on one side of the first tree, made a narrow,  irregular hole, and burrowed down till he reached a level where the  tap-root was somewhat less than four feet in diameter, and not quite as  hard as flint: then he found that he hadn't room to swing the axe, so he  heaved out another ton or two of earth--and rested. Next day he sank  a shaft on the other side of the gum; and after tea, over a pipe, it  struck him that it would be a good idea to burn the tree out, and so  use up the logs and lighter rubbish lying round. So he widened the  excavation, rolled in some logs, and set fire to them--with no better  result than to scorch the roots.    Tom persevered. He put the trace harness on his horse, drew in all the  logs within half a mile, and piled them on the windward side of that  gum; and during the night the fire found a soft place, and the tree  burnt off about six feet above the surface, falling on a squatter's  boundary fence, and leaving the ugliest kind of stump to occupy the  selector's attention; which it did, for a week. He waited till the hole  cooled, and then he went to work with pick, shovel, and axe: and even  now he gets interested in drawings of machinery, such as are published  in the agricultural weeklies, for getting out stumps without graft. He  thought he would be able to get some posts and rails out of that  tree, but found reason to think that a cast-iron column would split  sooner--and straighter. He traced some of the surface roots to the other  side of the selection, and broke most of his trace-chains trying to  get them out by horse-power--for they had other roots going down from  underneath. He cleared a patch in the course of time and for several  seasons he broke more ploughshares than he could pay for.    Meanwhile the squatter was not idle. Tom's tent was robbed several  times, and his hut burnt down twice. Then he was charged with killing  some sheep and a steer on the run, and converting them to his own use,  but got off mainly because there was a difference of opinion between the  squatter and the other local J.P. concerning politics and religion.    Tom ploughed and sowed wheat, but nothing came up to speak of--the  ground was too poor; so he carted stable manure six miles from the  nearest town, manured the land, sowed another crop, and prayed for  rain. It came. It raised a flood which washed the crop clean off the  selection, together with several acres of manure, and a considerable  portion of the original surface soil; and the water brought down enough  sand to make a beach, and spread it over the field to a depth of six  inches. The flood also took half a mile of fencing from along the  creek-bank, and landed it in a bend, three miles down, on a dummy  selection, where it was confiscated.    Tom didn't give up--he was energetic. He cleared another piece of ground  on the siding, and sowed more wheat; it had the rust in it, or the  smut--and averaged three shillings per bushel. Then he sowed lucerne and  oats, and bought a few cows: he had an idea of starting a dairy. First,  the cows' eyes got bad, and he sought the advice of a German cocky, and  acted upon it; he blew powdered alum through paper tubes into the bad  eyes, and got some of it snorted and butted back into his own. He cured  the cows' eyes and got the sandy blight in his own, and for a week or  so be couldn't tell one end of a cow from the other, but sat in a dark  corner of the hut and groaned, and soaked his glued eyelashes in warm  water. Germany stuck to him and nursed him, and saw him through.    Then the milkers got bad udders, and Tom took his life in his hands  whenever he milked them. He got them all right presently--and butter  fell to fourpence a pound. He and the aforesaid cocky made arrangements  to send their butter to a better market; and then the cows contracted  a disease which was known in those parts as \"plooro permoanyer,\" but  generally referred to as \"th' ploorer.\"    Again Tom sought advice, acting upon which he slit the cows' ears, cut  their tails half off to bleed them, and poured pints of \"pain killer\"  into them through their nostrils; but they wouldn't make an effort,  except, perhaps, to rise and poke the selector when he tried to tempt  their appetites with slices of immature pumpkin. They died peacefully  and persistently, until all were gone save a certain dangerous, barren,  slab-sided luny bovine with white eyes and much agility in jumping  fences, who was known locally as Queen Elizabeth.    Tom shot Queen Elizabeth, and turned his attention to agriculture again.  Then his plough horses took bad with some thing the Teuton called \"der  shtranguls.\" He submitted them to a course of treatment in accordance  with Jacob's advice--and they died.    Even then Tom didn't give in--there was grit in that man. He borrowed a  broken-down dray-horse in return for its keep, coupled it with his own  old riding hack, and started to finish ploughing. The team wasn't a  success. Whenever the draught horse's knees gave way and he stumbled  forward, he jerked the lighter horse back into the plough, and something  would break. Then Tom would blaspheme till he was refreshed, mend up  things with wire and bits of clothes-line, fill his pockets with stones  to throw at the team, and start again. Finally he hired a dummy's child  to drive the horses. The brat did his best he tugged at the head of the  team, prodded it behind, heaved rocks at it, cut a sapling, got up his  enthusiasm, and wildly whacked the light horse whenever the other showed  signs of moving--but he never succeeded in starting both horses at one  and the same time. Moreover the youth was cheeky, and the selector's  temper had been soured: he cursed the boy along with the horses, the  plough, the selection, the squatter, and Australia. Yes, he cursed  Australia. The boy cursed back, was chastised, and immediately went home  and brought his father.    Then the dummy's dog tackled the selector's dog and this precipitated  things. The dummy would have gone under had his wife not arrived on the  scene with the eldest son and the rest of the family. They all fell foul  of Tom. The woman was the worst. The selector's dog chawed the other and  came to his master's rescue just in time---or Tom Hopkins would never  have lived to become the inmate of a lunatic asylum.    Next year there happened to be good grass on Tom's selection and nowhere  else, and he thought it wouldn't be a bad idea--to get a few poor  sheep, and fatten them up for market: sheep were selling for about  seven-and-sixpence a dozen at that time. Tom got a hundred or two, but  the squatter had a man stationed at one side of the selection with dogs  to set on the sheep directly they put their noses through the fence  (Tom's was not a sheep fence). The dogs chased the sheep across the  selection and into the run again on the other side, where another man  waited ready to pound them.    Tom's dog did his best; but he fell sick while chawing up the fourth  capitalistic canine, and subsequently died. The dummies had robbed that  cur with poison before starting it across--that was the only way they  could get at Tom's dog.    Tom thought that two might play at the game, and he tried; but his  nephew, who happened to be up from the city on a visit, was arrested  at the instigation of the squatter for alleged sheep-stealing, and  sentenced to two years' hard; during which time the selector himself got  six months for assaulting the squatter with intent to do him grievous  bodily harm-which, indeed, he more than attempted, if a broken nose, a  fractured jaw, and the loss of most of the squatters' teeth amounted to  anything. The squatter by this time had made peace with the other local  Justice, and had become his father-in-law.    When Tom came out there was little left for him to live for; but he took  a job of fencing, got a few pounds together, and prepared to settle on  the land some more. He got a \"missus\" and a few cows during the next  year; the missus robbed him and ran away with the dummy, and the cows  died in the drought, or were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#2)"],[1,"parts of a sentence according to their offices and relations,  and not in the order of speech, has been spoken of as a fault. It is, on  the contrary, a merit, for it teaches the pupil to look through the  literary order and discover the logical order. He thus learns what the  literary order really is, and sees that this may be varied indefinitely, so  long as the logical relations are kept clear.    The assertion that correct diagrams can be made mechanically is not borne  out by the facts. It is easier to avoid precision in oral analysis than in  written. The diagram drives the pupil to a most searching examination of  the sentence, brings him face to face with every difficulty, and compels a  decision on every point.    +The Abuse of the Diagram+.--Analysis by diagram often becomes so  interesting and so helpful that, like other good things, it is liable to be  overdone. There is danger of requiring too much written analysis. When the  ordinary constructions have been made clear, diagrams should be used only  for the more difficult sentences, or, if the sentences are long, only for  the more difficult parts of them. In both oral and written analysis there  is danger of repeating what needs no repetition. When the diagram has  served its purpose, it should be dropped.      AUTHORS' NOTE TO REVISED EDITION.    During the years in which \"Higher Lessons\" has been in existence, we have  ourselves had an instructive experience with it in the classroom. We have  considered hundreds of suggestive letters written us by intelligent  teachers using the book. We have examined the best works on grammar that  have been published recently here and in England. And we have done more. We  have gone to the original source of all valid authority in our language--  the best writers and speakers of it. That we might ascertain what present  linguistic usage is, we chose fifty authors, now alive or living till  recently, and have carefully read three hundred pages of each. We have  minutely noted and recorded what these men by habitual use declare to be  good English. Among the fifty are such men as Ruskin, Froude, Hamerton,  Matthew Arnold, Macaulay, De Quincey, Thackeray, Bagehot, John Morley,  James Martineau, Cardinal Newman, J. R. Green, and Lecky in England; and  Hawthorne, Curtis, Prof. W. D. Whitney, George P. Marsh, Prescott, Emerson,  Motley, Prof. Austin Phelps, Holmes, Edward Everett, Irving, and Lowell in  America. When in the pages following we anywhere quote usage, it is to the  authority of such men that we appeal.    Upon these four sources of help we have drawn in the Revision of \"Higher  Lessons\" that we now offer to the public.    In this revised work we have given additional reasons for the opinions we  hold, and have advanced to some new positions; have explained more fully  what some teachers have thought obscure; have qualified what we think was  put too positively in former editions; have given the history of  constructions where this would deepen interest or aid in composition; have  quoted the verdicts of usage on many locutions condemned by purists; have  tried to work into the pupil's style the felicities of expression found in  the lesson sentences; have taught the pupil earlier in the work, and more  thoroughly, the structure and the function of paragraphs; and have led him  on from the composition of single sentences of all kinds to the composition  of these great groups of sentences. But the distinctive features of \"Higher  Lessons\" that have made the work so useful and so popular stand as they  have stood--the Study of Words from their Offices in the Sentence, Analysis  for the sake of subsequent Synthesis, Easy Gradation, the Subdivisions and  Modifications of the Parts of Speech after the treatment of these in the  Sentence, etc., etc. We confess to some surprise that so little of what was  thought good in matter and method years ago has been seriously affected by  criticism since.    The additions made to \"Higher Lessons\"--additions that bring the work up to  the latest requirements--are generally in foot-notes to pages, and  sometimes are incorporated into the body of the Lessons, which in number  and numbering remain as they were. The books of former editions and those  of this revised edition can, therefore, be used in the same class without  any inconvenience.    Of the teachers who have given us invaluable assistance in this Revision,  we wish specially to name Prof. Henry M. Worrell, of the Polytechnic  Institute; and in this edition of the work, as in the preceding, we take  pleasure in acknowledging our great indebtedness to our critic, the  distinguished Prof. Francis A. March, of Lafayette College.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 1.    A TALK ON LANGUAGE.    Let us talk to-day about a language that we never learn from a grammar or  from a book of any kind--a language that we come by naturally, and use  without thinking of it.    It is a universal language, and consequently needs no interpreter. People  of all lands and of all degrees of culture use it; even the brute animals  in some measure understand it.    This Natural language is the language of cries, laughter, and tones, the  language of the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the whole face; the language of  gestures and postures.    The child's cry tells of its wants; its sob, of grief; its scream, of pain;  its laugh, of delight. The boy raises his eyebrows in surprise and his nose  in disgust, leans forward in expectation, draws back in fear, makes a fist  in anger, and calls or drives away his dog simply by the tone in which he  speaks.    But feelings and desires are not the only things we wish to communicate.  Early in life we begin to acquire knowledge and learn to think, and then we  feel the need of a better language.    Suppose, for instance, you have formed an idea of a day; could you express  this by a tone, a look, or a gesture?    If you wish to tell me the fact that _yesterday was cloudy_, or that _the  days are shorter in winter than in summer_, you find it wholly impossible  to do this by means of Natural language.    To communicate, then, your thoughts, or even the mental pictures we have  called ideas, you need a language more nearly perfect.    This language is made up of words.    These words you learn from your mothers, and so Word language is your  mother-tongue. You learn them, also, from your friends and teachers, your  playmates and companions, and you learn them by reading; for words, as you  know, may be written as well as spoken.    This Word language we may, from its superiority, call +Language Proper+.    Natural language, as was said, precedes this Word language, but gives way  as Word language comes in and takes its place; yet Natural language may be  used, and always should be used, to assist and strengthen Word language. In  earnest conversation we enforce what we say in words, by the tone in which  we utter them, by the varying expression of the face, and by the movements  of the different parts of the body.    The look or the gesture may even dart ahead of the word, or it may  contradict it, and thus convict the speaker of ignorance or deception.    The happy union of the two kinds of language is the charm of all good  reading and speaking. The teacher of elocution is ever trying to recall the  pupil to the tones, the facial expression, and the action, so natural to  him in childhood and in animated conversation.    +DEFINITION.--_Language Proper_ consists of the spoken and the written  words used to communicate ideas and thoughts+.    +DEFINITION.--_English Grammar_ is the science which teaches the forms,  uses, and relations of the words of the English language.+           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 2.    A TALK ON THOUGHTS AND SENTENCES.    To express a thought we use more than a single word, and the words arranged  to express a thought we call a sentence.    But there was a time when, through lack of words, we compressed our thought  into a single word. The child says to his father, _up_, meaning, _Take me  up into your lap_; or, _book_, meaning, _This thing in my hand is a book_.    These first words always deal with the things that can be learned by the  senses; they express the child's ideas of these things.    We have spoken of thoughts and sentences; let us see now whether we can  find out what a thought is, and what a sentence is.    A sentence is a group of words expressing a thought; it is a body of which  a thought is the soul. It is something that can be seen or heard, while a  thought cannot be. Let us see whether, in studying a sentence, we may not  learn what a thought is.    In any such sentence as this, _Spiders spin_, something is said, or  asserted, about something. Here it is said, or asserted, of the animals,  spiders, that they spin.    The sentence, then, consists of two parts,--the name of that of which  something is said, and that which is said of it.    The first of these parts we call the +Subject+ of the sentence; the second,  the +Predicate+.    Now, if the sentence, composed of two parts, expresses the thought, there  must be in the thought two parts to be expressed. And there are two: viz.,  something of which we think, and that which we think of it. In the thought  expressed by _Spiders spin_, the animals, spiders, are the something of  which we think, and their spinning is what we think of them. In the  sentence expressing this thought, the word _spiders_ names that of which we  think, and the word _spin_ tells what we think of spiders.    Not every group of words is necessarily a sentence, because it may not be  the expression of a thought. _Spiders spinning_ is not a sentence. There is  nothing in this expression to show that we have formed a judgment, _i.e._,  that we have really made up our minds that spiders do spin. The spinning is  not asserted of the spiders.    _Soft feathers_, _The shining sun_ are not sentences,"]]]
