After a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quite  simple and natural way:        THE STRANGER'S HISTORY    I am an American.  I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State  of Connecticut--anyway, just over the river, in the country.  So  I am a Yankee of the Yankees--and practical; yes, and nearly  barren of sentiment, I suppose--or poetry, in other words.  My  father was a blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was  both, along at first.  Then I went over to the great arms factory  and learned my real trade; learned all there was to it; learned  to make everything: guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all  sorts of labor-saving machinery.  Why, I could make anything  a body wanted--anything in the world, it didn't make any difference  what; and if there wasn't any quick new-fangled way to make a thing,  I could invent one--and do it as easy as rolling off a log.  I became  head superintendent; had a couple of thousand men under me.    Well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight--that goes  without saying.  With a couple of thousand rough men under one,  one has plenty of that sort of amusement.  I had, anyway.  At last  I met my match, and I got my dose.  It was during a misunderstanding  conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules.  He laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything  crack, and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it  overlap its neighbor.  Then the world went out in darkness, and  I didn't feel anything more, and didn't know anything at all  --at least for a while.    When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the  grass, with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all  to myself--nearly.  Not entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse,  looking down at me--a fellow fresh out of a picture-book.  He was  in old-time iron armor from head to heel, with a helmet on his  head the shape of a nail-keg with slits in it; and he had a shield,  and a sword, and a prodigious spear; and his horse had armor on,  too, and a steel horn projecting from his forehead, and gorgeous  red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like  a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.    \"Fair sir, will ye just?\" said this fellow.    \"Will I which?\"    \"Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for--\"    \"What are you giving me?\" I said.  \"Get along back to your circus,  or I'll report you.\"    Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards  and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his  nail-keg bent down nearly to his horse's neck and his long spear  pointed straight ahead.  I saw he meant business, so I was up  the tree when he arrived.    He allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear.  There was argument on his side--and the bulk of the advantage  --so I judged it best to humor him.  We fixed up an agreement  whereby I was to go with him and he was not to hurt me.  I came  down, and we started away, I walking by the side of his horse.  We marched comfortably along, through glades and over brooks which  I could not remember to have seen before--which puzzled me and  made me wonder--and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of  a circus.  So I gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he was  from an asylum.  But we never came to an asylum--so I was up  a stump, as you may say.  I asked him how far we were from Hartford.  He said he had never heard of the place; which I took to be a lie,  but allowed it to go at that.  At the end of an hour we saw a  far-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river; and beyond  it on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with towers and turrets,  the first I had ever seen out of a picture.    \"Bridgeport?\" said I, pointing.    \"Camelot,\" said he.      My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness.  He caught  himself nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete  smiles of his, and said:    \"I find I can't go on; but come with me, I've got it all written  out, and you can read it if you like.\"    In his chamber, he said: \"First, I kept a journal; then by and by,  after years, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How  long ago that was!\"    He handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where  I should begin:    \"Begin here--I've already told you what goes before.\"  He was  steeped in drowsiness by this time.  As I went out at his door  I heard him murmur sleepily: \"Give you good den, fair sir.\"    I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure.  The first part  of it--the great bulk of it--was parchment, and yellow with age.  I scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest.  Under the old dim writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces  of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still--Latin words  and sentences: fragments from old monkish legends, evidently.  I turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read  --as follows:          THE TALE OF THE LOST LAND          CHAPTER I    CAMELOT    \"Camelot--Camelot,\" said I to myself.  \"I don't seem to remember  hearing of it before.  Name of the asylum, likely.\"    It was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream,  and as lonesome as Sunday.  The air was full of the smell of  flowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds,  and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life,  nothing going on.  The road was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints  in it, and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in  the grass--wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one's hand.    Presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten years old, with a cataract  of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders, came along.  Around her head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies. It was as  sweet an outfit as ever I saw, what there was of it.  She walked  indolently along, with a mind at rest, its peace reflected in her  innocent face.  The circus man paid no attention to her; didn't  even seem to see her.  And she--she was no more startled at his  fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of  her life.  She was going by as indifferently as she might have gone  by a couple of cows; but when she happened to notice me, _then_  there was a change!  Up went her hands, and she was turned to stone;  her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously, she  was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear.  And  there she stood gazing, in a sort of stupefied fascination, till  we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view.  That  she should be startled at me instead of at the other man, was too  many for me; I couldn't make head or tail of it.  And that she  should seem to consider me a spectacle, and totally overlook her  own merits in that respect, was another puzzling thing, and a  display of magnanimity, too, that was surprising in one so young.  There was food for thought here.  I moved along as one in a dream.    As we approached the town, signs of life began to appear.  At  intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and  about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of  cultivation.  There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse,  uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look  like animals.  They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse  tow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of  sandal, and many wore an iron collar.  The small boys and girls  were always naked; but nobody seemed to know it.  All of these  people stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetched  out their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed that  other fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get no  response for their pains.    In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone  scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets were  mere crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude children  played in the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rooted  contentedly about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in  the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family.  Presently there was a distant blare of military music; it came  nearer, still nearer, and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view,  glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners  and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded spearheads; and  through the muck and swine, and naked brats, and joyous dogs, and  shabby huts, it took its gallant way, and in its wake we followed.  Followed through one winding alley and then another,--and climbing,  always climbing--till at last we gained the breezy height where  the huge castle stood.  There was an exchange of bugle blasts;  then a parley from the walls, where men-at-arms, in hauberk and  morion, marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under  flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon  them; and then the great gates were flung open, the drawbridge  was lowered, and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under  the frowning arches; and we, following, soon found ourselves in  a great paved court, with towers and turrets stretching up into  the blue air on all the four sides; and all about us the dismount  was going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and running to and  fro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, and  an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion.        CHAPTER II    KING ARTHUR'S COURT    The moment I got a chance I slipped aside privately and touched  an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said, in an  insinuating, confidential way:    \"Friend, do me a kindness.  Do you belong to the asylum, or are  you just on a visit or something like that?\"    He looked me over stupidly, and said:    \"Marry, fair sir, me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7243"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 2. (#2)"],[1,"appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at  nightfall.  For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread  and blacken, then I judged it was time for me to appear.  I ordered  the torch-baskets to be lit, and Merlin liberated and sent to me.  A quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found  the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness  toward Merlin's Tower.  Already the darkness was so heavy that  one could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being  partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great  torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.    Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  I said:    \"You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm,  and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional  reputation.  Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up  your tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you  think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, step  to the bat, it's your innings.\"    \"I can, fair sir, and I will. Doubt it not.\"    He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt  a pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromatic  smoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves  and get uncomfortable.  Then he began to mutter and make passes  in the air with his hands.  He worked himself up slowly and  gradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around with  his arms like the sails of a windmill.  By this time the storm had  about reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and  making the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rain  were falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightning  began to wink fitfully.  Of course, my rod would be loading itself  now.  In fact, things were imminent. So I said:    \"You have had time enough.  I have given you every advantage,  and not interfered.  It is plain your magic is weak. It is only  fair that I begin now.\"    I made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awful  crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along  with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday,  and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground  in a general collapse of consternation.  Well, it rained mortar and  masonry the rest of the week.  This was the report; but probably  the facts would have modified it.    It was an effective miracle.  The great bothersome temporary  population vanished.  There were a good many thousand tracks  in the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.  If I had advertised another miracle I couldn't have raised an  audience with a sheriff.    Merlin's stock was flat.  The king wanted to stop his wages; he  even wanted to banish him, but I interfered.  I said he would be  useful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,  and I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little  parlor-magic soured on him.  There wasn't a rag of his tower left,  but I had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him  to take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  And as for  being grateful, he never even said thank you.  He was a rather  hard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn't fairly  expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so.        CHAPTER VIII    THE BOSS    To be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to have  the on-looking world consent to it is a finer.  The tower episode  solidified my power, and made it impregnable.  If any were perchance  disposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienced  a change of heart, now.  There was not any one in the kingdom  who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters.    I was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.  For a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my \"dream,\"  and listen for the Colt's factory whistle; but that sort of thing  played itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to realize  that I was actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur's  court, not a lunatic asylum.  After that, I was just as much  at home in that century as I could have been in any other; and  as for preference, I wouldn't have traded it for the twentieth.  Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains,  pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.  The grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor;  not a man who wasn't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities;  whereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century?  I should  be foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine  down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.    What a jump I had made!  I couldn't keep from thinking about it,  and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil.  There  was nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be  Joseph's case; and Joseph's only approached it, it didn't equal  it, quite.  For it stands to reason that as Joseph's splendid  financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the general  public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas  I had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was  popular by reason of it.    I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself  was the shadow.  My power was colossal; and it was not a mere  name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine  article.  I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second  great period of the world's history; and could see the trickling  stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and roll  its mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could note the  upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long  array of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses;  the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France, and Charles  the Second's scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the procession  was my full-sized fellow visible.  I was a Unique; and glad to know  that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen  centuries and a half, for sure.  Yes, in power I was equal to  the king.  At the same time there was another power that was  a trifle stronger than both of us put together.  That was the Church.  I do not wish to disguise that fact.  I couldn't, if I wanted to.  But never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its proper  place, later on.  It didn't cause me any trouble in the beginning  --at least any of consequence.    Well, it was a curious country, and full of interest.  And the  people!  They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race;  why, they were nothing but rabbits.  It was pitiful for a person  born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble  and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church  and nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor  king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor  the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!  Why, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind  of aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you  are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably  never find it out for yourself, and don't believe it when somebody  else tells you.  It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race  to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones  without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people  that have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchs  and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and  obscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.    The most of King Arthur's British nation were slaves, pure and  simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their  necks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;  they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves  so.  The truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one  object, and one only: to grovel before king and Church and noble;  to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might  be fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that  they might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks and  jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them,  be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures  of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves  the gods of this world.  And for all this, the thanks they got were  cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took  even this sort of attention as an honor.    Inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe  and examine.  I had mine, the king and his people had theirs.  In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit,  and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason  and argument would have had a long contract on his hands.  For  instance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without  title and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts  and acquirements or hadn't, were creatures of no more consideration  than so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea  that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams  of inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but  to be laughed at.  The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was  natural.  You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant  in the menagerie: well, that is the idea.  They are full of  admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they  speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels  which are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak  with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able  to"]]]
