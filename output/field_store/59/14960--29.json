[_Pleased Gnomes_. l. 73. The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs,  Nymphs, and Salamanders affords proper machinery for a philosophic poem;  as it is probable that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic  figures of the Elements, or of Genii presiding over their operations.  The Fairies of more modern days seem to have been derived from them, and  to have inherited their powers. The Gnomes and Sylphs, as being more  nearly allied to modern Fairies are represented as either male or  female, which distinguishes the latter from the Aurae of the Latin  Poets, which were only female; except the winds, as Zephyrus and Auster,  may be supposed to have been their husbands.]             First the fine Forms her dulcet voice requires,       Which bathe or bask in elemental fires;       From each bright gem of Day's refulgent car,       From the pale sphere of every twinkling star,   85  From each nice pore of ocean, earth, and air,       With eye of flame the sparkling hosts repair,       Mix their gay hues, in changeful circles play,       Like motes, that tenant the meridian ray.--       So the clear Lens collects with magic power   90  The countless glories of the midnight hour;       Stars after stars with quivering lustre fall,       And twinkling glide along the whiten'd wall.--       Pleased, as they pass, she counts the glittering bands,       And stills their murmur with her waving hands;   95  Each listening tribe with fond expectance burns,       And now to these, and now to those, she turns.

[_Nymphs of primeval fire_. l. 97. The fluid matter of heat is perhaps  the most extensive element in nature; all other bodies are immersed in  it, and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by  the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known  bodies are contractible into less space by depriving them of some  portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally  deprived of heat, there is reason to believe that the particles of  bodies do not touch, but are held towards each other by their self-  attraction, and recede from each other by their attraction to the mass  of heat which surrounds them; and thus exist in an equilibrium between  these two powers. If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they  recede further from each other, and become fluid; if still more be  applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed Gasses by the modern  chemists. Thus when water is heated to a certain degree, it would  instantly assume the form of steam, but for the pressure of the  atmosphere, which prevents this change from taking place so easily; the  same is true of quicksilver, diamonds, and of perhaps all other bodies  in Nature; they would first become fluid, and then aeriform by  appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this elastic matter of  heat, termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French  Academicians, is liable to become consolidated itself in its  combinations with some bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in  combustible bodies as sulphur and charcoal. See note on l. 232, of this  Canto. Modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether  light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the same fluid,  as they have many properties in common. See note on l. 462 of this  Canto.]    [_When Love Divine_. l. 101. From having observed the gradual evolution  of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed; and afterwards its  successive advances to its more perfect state, or maturity; philosophers  of all ages seem to have imagined, that the great world itself had  likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity; this seems to  have given origin to the very antient and sublime allegory of Eros, or  Divine Love, producing the world from the egg of Night, as it floated in  Chaos. See l. 419. of this Canto.    The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our  view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; since these have  evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes,  the decomposition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal  materials, and must therefore have been formed progressively from small  beginnings. There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete  appendages to plants and animals, which seem to shew they have gradually  undergone changes from their original state; such as the stamens without  anthers, and styles without stigmas of several plants, as mentioned in  the note on Curcuma, Vol. II. of this work. Such is the halteres, or  rudiments of wings of some two-winged insects; and the paps of male  animals; thus swine have four toes, but two of them are imperfectly  formed, and not long enough for use. The allantoide in some animals  seems to have become extinct; in others is above tenfold the size, which  would seem necessary for its purpose. Buffon du Cochon. T. 6. p. 257.  Perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of Nature are remains of their  habits of production in their former less perfect state, or attempts  towards greater perfection.]    [_Through all his realms_. l. 105. Mr. Herschel has given a very sublime  and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his  discovery of some thousand nebulae, or clouds of stars; many of which  are much larger collections of stars, than all those put together, which  are visible to our naked eyes, added to those which form the galaxy, or  milky zone, which surrounds us. He observes that in the vicinity of  these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in  other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have  attracted each other, on the supposition that infinite space was at  first equally sprinkled with them; as if it had at the beginning been  filled with a fluid mass, which had coagulated. Mr. Herschel has further  shewn, that the whole sidereal system is gradually moving round some  centre, which may be an opake mass of matter, Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV.  If all these Suns are moving round some great central body; they must  have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may  thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material,  where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power, which  could project a Sun out of Chaos, except by comparing it to the  explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of  other more elastic vapours; of the power of which under immeasurable  degrees of heat, and compression, we are yet ignorant.    It may be objected, that if the stars had been projected from a Chaos by  explosions, that they must have returned again into it from the known  laws of gravitation; this however would not happen, if the whole of  Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the same time, and  dispersed through infinite space at once, or in quick succession, in  every possible direction. The same objection may be stated against the  possibility of the planets having been thrown from the sun by  explosions; and the secondary planets from the primary ones; which will  be spoken of more at large in the second Canto, but if the planets are  supposed to have been projected from their suns, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9624"],[0,"Directions for Cookery, in its Various Branches (#2)"],[1,"have any objection  to cabbage, substitute a larger proportion of the other  vegetables. Put in also a bunch of sweet marjoram, tied up in a  thin muslin rag to prevent its floating on the top.    Let the soup simmer unceasingly till two o'clock, skimming it  well: then take it up, and put it into a tureen. If your dinner  hour is later, you may of course begin the soup later; but it will  require at least eight hours' cooking; remembering to put in the  vegetables three hours after the meat.    If you wish to send the meat to table, take the best part of it  out of the soup, about two hours before dinner. Have ready another  pot with a dozen tomatas and a few cloves. Moisten them with a  little of the soup, just sufficient to keep them from burning.  When the tomatas have stewed down soft, put the meat upon them,  and let it brown till dinner time over a few coals, keeping the  pot closely covered; then send it to table on a dish by itself.  Let the remainder of the meat be left in the large pot till you  send up the soup, as by that time it will be boiled to rags and  have transferred all its flavour to the liquid.    This soup will be greatly improved by the addition of a few dozen  ochras cut into very thin slices, and put in with the other  vegetables. You may put Lima beans into it, green peas, or indeed  any vegetables you like: or you may thicken it with ochras and  tomatas only.    Next day, take what is left of the soup, put it into a pot, and  simmer it over hot coals for half an hour: a longer time will  weaken the taste. If it has been well made and kept in a cool  place, it will be found better the second day than the first.    If your family is very small, and the leg of beef large, and the  season winter, it may furnish soup for four successive days. Cut  the beef in half; make soup of the first half, in the manner above  directed, and have the remainder warmed next day; then on the  third day make fresh soup of the second half.    We have been minute in these directions; for if strictly followed,  the soup, though plain, will be found excellent.    If you do not intend to serve up the meat separately, break to  pieces all the bones with a mallet or kitchen cleaver. This, by  causing them to give out their marrow, &c., will greatly enrich  the liquid. Do this, of course, when you first begin the soup.      FINE BEEF SOUP.    Begin this soup the day before it is wanted. Take a good piece of  fresh beef that has been newly killed: any substantial part will  do that has not too much fat about it: a fore leg is very good for  this purpose. Wash it well. Cut off all the meat, and break up the  bones. Put the meat and the bones into a large pot, very early in  the day, so as to allow eight or nine hours for its boiling.  Proportion the water to the quantity of meat--about a pint and a  half to each pound. Sprinkle the meat with a small quantity of  pepper and salt. Pour on the water, hang it over a moderate fire,  and boil it slowly; carefully skimming off all the fat that rises  to the top, and keeping it closely covered, except when you raise  the lid to skim it. Do not, on any account, put in additional  water to this soup while it is boiling; and take care that the  boiling goes steadily on, as, if it stops, the soup will be much  injured. But if the fire is too great, and the soup boils too  fast, the meat will become hard and tough, and will not give out  its juices.    After the meat is reduced to rags, and the soup sufficiently  boiled, remove the pot from the fire, and let it stand in the  corner for a quarter of an hour to settle. Then take it up, strain  it into a large earthen pan, cover it, and set it away in a cool  dry place till next day. Straining it makes it clear and bright,  and frees it from the shreds of meat and bone. If you find that it  jellies in the pan, (which it will if properly made,) do not  disturb it till you are ready to put it into the pot for the  second boiling, as breaking the jelly may prevent it from keeping  well.    On the following morning, boil separately, carrots, turnips,  onions, celery, and whatever other vegetables you intend to  thicken the soup with. Tomatas will greatly improve it. Prepare  them by taking off the skin, cutting them into small pieces, and  stewing them in their own juice till they are entirely dissolved.  Put on the carrots before any of the other vegetables, as they  require the longest time to boil. Or you may slice and put into  the soup a portion of the vegetables you are boiling for dinner;  but they must be nearly done before you put them in, as the second  boiling of the soup should not exceed half an hour, or indeed,  just sufficient time to heat it thoroughly.    Scrape off carefully from the cake of jellied soup whatever fat or  sediment may still be remaining on it; divide the jelly into  pieces, and about half an hour before it is to go to table, put it  into a pot, add the various vegetables, (having first sliced  them,) in sufficient quantities to make the soup very thick; hang  it over the fire and let it boil slowly, or simmer steadily till  dinner time. Boiling it much on the second day will destroy the  flavour, and render it flat and insipid. For this reason, in  making fine, clear beef soup, the vegetables are to be cooked  separately. They need not be put in the first day, as the soup is  to be strained; and on the second day, if put in raw, the length  of time required to cook them would spoil the soup by doing it too  much. We repeat, that when soup has been sufficiently boiled on  the first day, and all the juices and flavour of the meat  thoroughly extracted, half an hour is the utmost it requires on  the second.    Carefully avoid seasoning it too highly. Soup, otherwise  excellent, is frequently spoiled by too much pepper and salt.  These condiments can be added at table, according to the taste of  those that are eating it; but if too large a proportion of them is  put in by the cook, there is then no remedy, and the soup may by  some be found uneatable.    Many persons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the  first day, thinking that they improve its flavour. This may be  done in common soup that is not to be strained, but is  inadmissible if you wish it to be very bright and clear. Also,  unless you have a garden and a profusion of vegetables of your  own, it is somewhat extravagant, as when strained out they are of  no further use, and are therefore wasted.      MUTTON SOUP.    Cut off the shoulder part of a fore quarter of mutton, and having  cut all the meat from the bone, put it into a soup pot with two  quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim it well, and then  slacken the fire and simmer the meat for an hour and a half. Then  take the remainder of the mutton, and put it whole into the soup-pot  with sufficient boiling water to cover it well, and salt it to  your taste. Skim it the moment the fresh piece of meat begins to  boil, and about every quarter of an hour afterwards. It should  boil slowly five hours. Prepare half a dozen turnips, four  carrots, and three onions, (all cut up, but not small,) and put  them in about an hour and a half before dinner. [Footnote: The  carrots should be put in early, as they require a long time to  boil; if full grown, at least three hours.] You may also put in  some small dumplings. Add some chopped parsley.    Cut the meat off the scrag into small pieces, and send it to table  in the tureen with the soup. The other half of the mutton should  be served on a separate dish, with whole turnips boiled and laid  round it. Many persons are fond of mutton that has been boiled in  soup.    You may thicken this soup with rice or barley that has first been  soaked in cold water; or with green peas; or with young corn, cut  down from the cob; or with tomatas scalded, peeled, and cut into  pieces.    _Cabbage Soup_ may be made in the same manner, of neck of  mutton. Omit all the other vegetables, and put in a large head of  white cabbage, stripped of the outside leaves, and cut small.    _Noodle Soup_ can be made in this manner also. Noodles are a  mixture of flour and beaten egg, made into a stiff paste, kneaded,  rolled out very thin, and cut into long narrow slips, not thicker  than straws, and then dried three or four hours in the sun, on tin  or pewter plates. They must be put in the soup shortly before  dinner, as, if boiled too long they will go to pieces.    With the mutton that is taken from the soup you may send to table  some suet dumplings, boiled in another pot, and served on a  separate dish. Make them in the proportion of half a pound of beef  suet to a pound and a quarter of flour. Chop the suet as fine as  possible, rub it into the flour, and mix it into a dough with a  little cold water. Roll it out thick, and cut it into dumplings  about as large as the top of a tumbler, and boil them an hour.      VEAL SOUP.    The knuckle or leg of veal is the best for soup. Wash it and break  up the bones. Put it into a pot with a pound of ham or bacon cut  into pieces, and water enough to cover the meat. A set of calf's  feet, cut in half, will greatly improve it. After it has stewed  slowly, till all the meat drops to pieces, strain it, return it to  the pot, and put in a head of celery cut small, three onions, a  bunch of sweet marjoram, a carrot and a turnip cut into pieces,  and two dozen black pepper-corns, with salt to your taste. Add  some small dumplings made of flour and butter. Simmer it another  hour, or till all the vegetables are sufficiently done, and thus  send it to table.    You may thicken it with noodles, that is paste made of flour and  beaten egg, and cut into long thin slips. Or with vermicelli,  rice, or barley; or with green peas, or asparagus tops.      RICH VEAL SOUP.    Take three pounds of the scrag of a neck of veal, cut it into  pieces, and put it with the bones (which must be broken up) into a  pot with two quarts of"]]]
