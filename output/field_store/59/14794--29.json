[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#2)"],[1,"h, it's practically over,' I lied cheerfully. 'No more fighting for  you and precious little for me. The Boche is done in all right ... What  you've got to do, my lad, is to sleep fourteen hours in the twenty-four  and spend half the rest catching trout. We'll have a shot at the  grouse-bird together this autumn and we'll get some of the old gang to  join us.'    Someone put a tea-tray on the table beside us, and I looked up to see  the very prettiest girl I ever set eyes on. She seemed little more than  a child, and before the war would probably have still ranked as a  flapper. She wore the neat blue dress and apron of a V.A.D. and her  white cap was set on hair like spun gold. She smiled demurely as she  arranged the tea-things, and I thought I had never seen eyes at once so  merry and so grave. I stared after her as she walked across the lawn,  and I remember noticing that she moved with the free grace of an  athletic boy.    'Who on earth's that?' I asked Blaikie.    'That? Oh, one of the sisters,' he said listlessly. 'There are squads  of them. I can't tell one from another.'    Nothing gave me such an impression of my friend's sickness as the fact  that he should have no interest in something so fresh and jolly as that  girl. Presently my time was up and I had to go, and as I looked back I  saw him sunk in his chair again, his eyes fixed on vacancy, and his  hands gripping his knees.    The thought of him depressed me horribly. Here was I condemned to some  rotten buffoonery in inglorious safety, while the salt of the earth  like Blaikie was paying the ghastliest price. From him my thoughts flew  to old Peter Pienaar, and I sat down on a roadside wall and read his  last letter. It nearly made me howl. Peter, you must know, had shaved  his beard and joined the Royal Flying Corps the summer before when we  got back from the Greenmantle affair. That was the only kind of reward  he wanted, and, though he was absurdly over age, the authorities  allowed it. They were wise not to stickle about rules, for Peter's  eyesight and nerve were as good as those of any boy of twenty. I knew  he would do well, but I was not prepared for his immediately blazing  success. He got his pilot's certificate in record time and went out to  France; and presently even we foot-sloggers, busy shifting ground  before the Somme, began to hear rumours of his doings. He developed a  perfect genius for air-fighting. There were plenty better trick-flyers,  and plenty who knew more about the science of the game, but there was  no one with quite Peter's genius for an actual scrap. He was as full of  dodges a couple of miles up in the sky as he had been among the rocks  of the Berg. He apparently knew how to hide in the empty air as  cleverly as in the long grass of the Lebombo Flats. Amazing yarns began  to circulate among the infantry about this new airman, who could take  cover below one plane of an enemy squadron while all the rest were  looking for him. I remember talking about him with the South Africans  when we were out resting next door to them after the bloody Delville  Wood business. The day before we had seen a good battle in the clouds  when the Boche plane had crashed, and a Transvaal machine-gun officer  brought the report that the British airman had been Pienaar. 'Well  done, the old _takhaar_!' he cried, and started to yarn about Peter's  methods. It appeared that Peter had a theory that every man has a blind  spot, and that he knew just how to find that blind spot in the world of  air. The best cover, he maintained, was not in cloud or a wisp of fog,  but in the unseeing patch in the eye of your enemy. I recognized that  talk for the real thing. It was on a par with Peter's doctrine of  'atmosphere' and 'the double bluff' and all the other principles that  his queer old mind had cogitated out of his rackety life.    By the end of August that year Peter's was about the best-known figure  in the Flying Corps. If the reports had mentioned names he would have  been a national hero, but he was only 'Lieutenant Blank', and the  newspapers, which expatiated on his deeds, had to praise the Service  and not the man. That was right enough, for half the magic of our  Flying Corps was its freedom from advertisement. But the British Army  knew all about him, and the men in the trenches used to discuss him as  if he were a crack football-player. There was a very big German airman  called Lensch, one of the Albatross heroes, who about the end of August  claimed to have destroyed thirty-two Allied machines. Peter had then  only seventeen planes to his credit, but he was rapidly increasing his  score. Lensch was a mighty man of valour and a good sportsman after his  fashion. He was amazingly quick at manoeuvring his machine in the  actual fight, but Peter was supposed to be better at forcing the kind  of fight he wanted. Lensch, if you like, was the tactician and Peter  the strategist. Anyhow the two were out to get each other. There were  plenty of fellows who saw the campaign as a struggle not between Hun  and Briton, but between Lensch and Pienaar.    The 15th September came, and I got knocked out and went to hospital.  When I was fit to read the papers again and receive letters, I found to  my consternation that Peter had been downed. It happened at the end of  October when the southwest gales badly handicapped our airwork. When  our bombing or reconnaissance jobs behind the enemy lines were  completed, instead of being able to glide back into safety, we had to  fight our way home slowly against a head-wind exposed to Archies and  Hun planes. Somewhere east of Bapaume on a return journey Peter fell in  with Lensch--at least the German Press gave Lensch the credit. His  petrol tank was shot to bits and he was forced to descend in a wood  near Morchies. 'The celebrated British airman, Pinner,' in the words of  the German communique, was made prisoner.    I had no letter from him till the beginning of the New Year, when I was  preparing to return to France. It was a very contented letter. He  seemed to have been fairly well treated, though he had always a low  standard of what he expected from the world in the way of comfort. I  inferred that his captors had not identified in the brilliant airman  the Dutch miscreant who a year before had broken out of a German jail.  He had discovered the pleasures of reading and had perfected himself in  an art which he had once practised indifferently. Somehow or other he  had got a _Pilgrim's Progress_, from which he seemed to extract  enormous pleasure. And then at the end, quite casually, he mentioned  that he had been badly wounded and that his left leg would never be  much use again.    After that I got frequent letters, and I wrote to him every week and  sent him every kind of parcel I could think of. His letters used to  make me both ashamed and happy. I had always banked on old Peter, and  here he was behaving like an early Christian martyr--never a word of  complaint, and just as cheery as if it were a winter morning on the  high veld and we were off to ride down springbok. I knew what the loss  of a leg must mean to him, for bodily fitness had always been his  pride. The rest of life must have unrolled itself before him very drab  and dusty to the grave. But he wrote as if he were on the top of his  form and kept commiserating me on the discomforts of my job. The  picture of that patient, gentle old fellow, hobbling about his compound  and puzzling over his _Pilgrim's Progress_, a cripple for life after  five months of blazing glory, would have stiffened the back of a  jellyfish.    This last letter was horribly touching, for summer had come and the  smell of the woods behind his prison reminded Peter of a place in the  Woodbush, and one could read in every sentence the ache of exile. I sat  on that stone wall and considered how trifling were the crumpled leaves  in my bed of life compared with the thorns Peter and Blaikie had to lie  on. I thought of Sandy far off in Mesopotamia, and old Blenkiron  groaning with dyspepsia somewhere in America, and I considered that  they were the kind of fellows who did their jobs without complaining.  The result was that when I got up to go on I had recovered a manlier  temper. I wasn't going to shame my friends or pick and choose my duty.  I would trust myself to Providence, for, as Blenkiron used to say,  Providence was all right if you gave him a chance.    It was not only Peter's letter that steadied and calmed me. Isham stood  high up in a fold of the hills away from the main valley, and the road  I was taking brought me over the ridge and back to the stream-side. I  climbed through great beechwoods, which seemed in the twilight like  some green place far below the sea, and then over a short stretch of  hill pasture to the rim of the vale. All about me were little fields  enclosed with walls of grey stone and full of dim sheep. Below were  dusky woods around what I took to be Fosse Manor, for the great Roman  Fosse Way, straight as an arrow, passed over the hills to the south and  skirted its grounds. I could see the stream slipping among its  water-meadows and could hear the plash of the weir. A tiny village  settled in a crook of the hill, and its church-tower sounded seven with  a curiously sweet chime. Otherwise there was no noise but the twitter  of small birds and the night wind in the tops of the beeches.    In that moment I had a kind of revelation. I had a vision of what I had  been fighting for, what we all were fighting for. It was peace, deep  and holy and ancient, peace older than the oldest wars, peace which  would endure when all our swords were hammered into ploughshares. It  was more; for in that hour England first took hold of me. Before my  country had been South Africa, and when I thought of home it had been  the wide sun-steeped spaces of the veld or some scented glen of the  Berg. But now I realized that I had a new home.

INTRODUCTION.    THE chief object of the present work is to describe and connect together  several large classes of movement, common to almost all plants. The most  widely prevalent movement is essentially of the same nature as that of the  stem of a climbing plant, which bends successively to all points of the  compass, so that the tip revolves. This movement has been called by Sachs  \"revolving nutation;\" but we have found it much more convenient to use the  terms circumnutation and circumnutate. As we shall have to say much about  this movement, it will be useful here briefly to describe its nature. If we  observe a circumnutating stem, which happens at the time to be bent, we  will say towards the north, it will be found gradually to bend more and  more easterly, until it faces the east; and so onwards to the south, then  to the west, and back again to the north. If the movement had been quite  regular, the apex would have described a circle, or rather, as the stem is  always growing upwards, a circular spiral. But it generally describes  irregular elliptical or oval figures; for the apex, after pointing in any  one direction, commonly moves back to the opposite side, not, however,  returning along the same line. Afterwards other irregular ellipses or ovals  are successively described, with their longer  [page 2]  axes directed to different points of the compass. Whilst describing such  figures, the apex often travels in a zigzag line, or makes small  subordinate loops or triangles. In the case of leaves the ellipses are  generally narrow.    Until recently the cause of all such bending movements was believed to be  due to the increased growth of the side which becomes for a time convex;  that this side does temporarily grow more quickly than the concave side has  been well established; but De Vries has lately shown that such increased  growth follows a previously increased state of turgescence on the convex  side.* In the case of parts provided with a so-called joint, cushion or  pulvinus, which consists of an aggregate of small cells that have ceased to  increase in size from a very early age, we meet with similar movements; and  here, as Pfeffer has shown** and as we shall see in the course of this  work, the increased turgescence of the cells on opposite sides is not  followed by increased growth. Wiesner denies in certain cases the accuracy  of De Vries' conclusion about turgescence, and maintains*** that the  increased extensibility of the cell-walls is the more important element.  That such extensibility must accompany increased turgescence in order that  the part may bend is manifest, and this has been insisted on by several  botanists; but in the case of unicellular plants it can hardly fail to be  the more important element. On the whole we may at present conclude that  in-    * Sachs first showed ('Lehrbuch,' etc., 4th edit. p. 452) the intimate  connection between turgescence and growth. For De Vries' interesting essay,  'Wachsthumskrümmungen mehrzelliger Organe,' see 'Bot. Zeitung,' Dec. 19,  1879, p. 830.    ** 'Die Periodischen Bewegungen der Blattorgane,' 1875.    *** 'Untersuchungen über den Heliotropismus,' Sitzb. der K. Akad. der  Wissenschaft. (Vienna), Jan. 1880.    [page 3]  creased growth, first on one side and then on another, is a secondary  effect, and that the increased turgescence of the cells, together with the  extensibility of their walls, is the primary cause of the movement of  circumnutation.*    In the course of the present volume it will be shown that apparently every  growing part of every plant is continually circumnutating, though often on  a small scale. Even the stems of seedlings before they have broken through  the ground, as well as their buried radicles, circumnutate, as far as the  pressure of the surrounding earth permits. In this universally present  movement we have the basis or groundwork for the acquirement, according to  the requirements of the plant, of the most diversified movements. Thus, the  great sweeps made by the stems of twining plants, and by the tendrils of  other climbers, result from a mere increase in the amplitude of the  ordinary movement of circumnutation. The position which young leaves and  other organs ultimately assume is acquired by the circumnutating movement  being increased in some one direction. the leaves of various plants are  said to sleep at night, and it will be seen that their blades then assume a  vertical position through modified circumnutation, in order to protect  their upper surfaces from being chilled through radiation.  The movements  of various organs to the light, which are so general throughout the  vegetable kingdom, and occasionally from the light, or transversely with  respect to it, are all modified    * See Mr. Vines' excellent discussion ('Arbeiten des Bot. Instituts in  Würzburg,' B. II. pp. 142, 143, 1878) on this intricate subject.  Hofmeister's observations ('Jahreschrifte des Vereins für Vaterl.  Naturkunde in Würtemberg,' 1874, p. 211) on the curious movements of  Spirogyra, a plant consisting of a single row of cells, are valuable in  relation to this subject.    [page 4]  forms of circumnutation; as again are the equally prevalent movements of  stems, etc., towards the zenith, and of roots towards the centre of the  earth. In accordance with these conclusions, a considerable difficulty in  the way of evolution is in part removed, for it might have been asked, how  did all these diversified movements for the most different purposes first  arise? As the case stands, we know that there is always movement in  progress, and its amplitude, or direction, or both, have only to be  modified for the good of the plant in relation with internal or external  stimuli.    Besides describing the several modified forms of circumnutation, some other  subjects will be discussed. The two which have interested us most are,  firstly, the fact that with some seedling plants the uppermost part alone  is sensitive to light, and transmits an influence to the lower part,  causing it to bend. If therefore the upper part be wholly protected from  light, the lower part may be exposed for hours to it, and yet does not  become in the least bent, although this would have occurred quickly if the  upper part had been excited by light. Secondly, with the radicles of  seedlings, the tip is sensitive to various stimuli, especially to very  slight pressure, and when thus excited, transmits an influence to the upper  part, causing it to bend from the pressed side. On the other hand, if the  tip is subjected to the vapour of water proceeding from one side, the upper  part of the radicle bends towards this side. Again it is the tip, as stated  by Ciesielski, though denied by others, which is sensitive to the  attraction of gravity, and by transmission causes the adjoining parts of  the radicle to bend towards the centre of the earth. These several cases of  the effects of contact, other irritants, vapour, light, and the  [page 5]  attraction of gravity being transmitted from the excited part for some  little distance along the organ in question, have an important bearing on  the theory of all such movements.    [Terminology.--A brief explanation of some terms which will be used, must  here be given. With seedlings, the stem which supports the cotyledons (i.e.  the organs which represent the first leaves) has been called by many  botanists the hypocotyledonous stem, but for brevity sake we will speak of  it merely as the hypocotyl: the stem immediately above the cotyledons will  be called the epicotyl or plumule. The radicle can be distinguished from  the hypocotyl only by the presence of root-hairs and the nature of its  covering. The meaning of the word circumnutation has already been  explained. Authors speak of positive and negative heliotropism,*--that is,  the bending of an organ to or from the light; but it is much more  convenient to confine the word heliotropism to bending towards the light,  and to designate as apheliotropism bending from the light. There is another  reason for this change, for writers, as we have observed, occasionally drop  the adjectives positive and negative, and thus introduce confusion into  their discussions. Diaheliotropism may express a position more or less  transverse to the light and induced by it. In like manner positive  geotropism, or bending towards the centre of the earth, will be called by  us geotropism; apogeotropism will mean bending in opposition to gravity or  from the centre of the earth; and diageotropism, a position more or less  transverse to the radius of the earth. The words heliotropism and  geotropism properly mean the act of moving in relation to the light or the  earth; but in the same manner as gravitation, though defined as \"the act of  tending to the centre,\" is often used to express the cause of a body  falling, so it will be found convenient occasionally to employ heliotropism  and geotropism, etc., as the cause of the movements in question.    The term epinasty is now often used in Germany, and implies that the upper  surface of an organ grows more quickly than the    * The highly useful terms of Heliotropism and Geotropism were first used by  Dr. A. B. Frank: see his remarkable 'Beiträge zur Pflanzenphysiologie,'  1868.  [page 6]  lower surface, and thus causes it to bend downwards."]]]
