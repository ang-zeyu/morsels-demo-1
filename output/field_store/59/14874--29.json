Here was another illustration of the childlike  improvidence of this age and people.  A man in armor always trusted  to chance for his food on a journey, and would have been scandalized  at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear.  There  was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who  would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing  as that on his flagstaff.  And yet there could not be anything more  sensible.  It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches  into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make  an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.    Night approached, and with it a storm.  The darkness came on fast.  We must camp, of course.  I found a good shelter for the demoiselle  under a rock, and went off and found another for myself.  But  I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it off  by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it  would have seemed so like undressing before folk.  It would not  have amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on  underneath; but the prejudices of one's breeding are not gotten  rid of just at a jump, and I knew that when it came to stripping  off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed.    With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the wind  blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colder  it got.  Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms  and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside  my armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough,  and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority  were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still,  but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what;  especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisome  procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are  a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again.  It would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not roll  or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the  different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want  to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worse  than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder,  too, if you can.  Still, if one did not roll and thrash around  he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other;  there is no real choice.  Even after I was frozen solid I could  still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is  taking electric treatment.  I said I would never wear armor  after this trip.    All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living  fire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, that  same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my  tired head: How do people stand this miserable armor?  How have  they managed to stand it all these generations?  How can they sleep  at night for dreading the tortures of next day?    When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: seedy,  drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around,  famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid of  the animals; and crippled with rheumatism.  And how had it fared  with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande  la Carteloise?  Why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept  like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any  other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not  missing it.  Measured by modern standards, they were merely modified  savages, those people.  This noble lady showed no impatience to get  to breakfast--and that smacks of the savage, too.  On their journeys  those Britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them;  and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting,  after the style of the Indian and the anaconda.  As like as not,  Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch.    We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along  behind.  In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor  creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded  as a road.  They were as humble as animals to me; and when I  proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so  overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that  at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest.  My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she said  in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the  other cattle--a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely  because it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offended  them, for it didn't.  And yet they were not slaves, not chattels.  By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen.  Seven-tenths  of the free population of the country were of just their class and  degree: small \"independent\" farmers, artisans, etc.; which is  to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about  all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy,  and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and  leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king,  nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with  the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value  in any rationally constructed world.  And yet, by ingenious  contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail  of the procession where it belonged, was marching head up and  banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to be  the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long  that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only  that, but to believe it right and as it should be.  The priests  had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state  of things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how  unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially  such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter  there and become respectfully quiet.    The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in  a formerly American ear.  They were freemen, but they could not  leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his  permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must have  their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery,  and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a piece of their  own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the  proceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else's without remembering  him in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest his grain for him  gratis, and be ready to come at a moment's notice, leaving their  own crop to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to let  him plant fruit trees in their fields, and then keep their indignation  to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain  around the trees; they had to smother their anger when his hunting  parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of  their patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves,  and when the swarms from my lord's dovecote settled on their crops  they must not lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful would  the penalty be; when the harvest was at last gathered, then came  the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: first  the Church carted off its fat tenth, then the king's commissioner  took his twentieth, then my lord's people made a mighty inroad  upon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty  to bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble;  there were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes  again, and yet other taxes--upon this free and independent pauper,  but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the  wasteful nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would  sleep unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day's  work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman's  daughter--but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is  unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with his  tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, and  sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle  Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried him  at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back,  and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property  and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors.    And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work  on their lord the bishop's road three days each--gratis; every  head of a family, and every son of a family, three days each,  gratis, and a day or so added for their servants.  Why, it was  like reading about France and the French, before the ever memorable  and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such  villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood--one: a settlement  of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for  each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of  that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and  shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell.  There were two \"Reigns of Terror,\" if we would but remember it  and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other  in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had  lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand  persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are  all for the \"horrors\" of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror,  so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe,  compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty,  and heart-break?  What "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7245"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 4. (#2)"],[1," \"I had not thought of that, it being but of small consequence.  But an I would, I could not, for that the accuser came masked by  night, and told the forester, and straightway got him hence again,  and so the forester knoweth him not.\"    \"Then is this Unknown the only person who saw the stag killed?\"    \"Marry, _no_ man _saw_ the killing, but this Unknown saw this hardy  wretch near to the spot where the stag lay, and came with right  loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester.\"    \"So the Unknown was near the dead stag, too?  Isn't it just possible  that he did the killing himself?  His loyal zeal--in a mask--looks  just a shade suspicious.  But what is your highness's idea for  racking the prisoner?  Where is the profit?\"    \"He will not confess, else; and then were his soul lost.  For his  crime his life is forfeited by the law--and of a surety will I see  that he payeth it!--but it were peril to my own soul to let him  die unconfessed and unabsolved.  Nay, I were a fool to fling me  into hell for _his_ accommodation.\"    \"But, your Highness, suppose he has nothing to confess?\"    \"As to that, we shall see, anon.  An I rack him to death and he  confess not, it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught  to confess--ye will grant that that is sooth?  Then shall I not be  damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess  --wherefore, I shall be safe.\"    It was the stubborn unreasoning of the time.  It was useless to  argue with her.  Arguments have no chance against petrified  training; they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff.  And  her training was everybody's.  The brightest intellect in the land  would not have been able to see that her position was defective.    As we entered the rack-cell I caught a picture that will not go  from me; I wish it would.  A native young giant of thirty or  thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back, with his  wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either  end.  There was no color in him; his features were contorted and  set, and sweat-drops stood upon his forehead.  A priest bent over  him on each side; the executioner stood by; guards were on duty;  smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls; in a corner  crouched a poor young creature, her face drawn with anguish,  a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes, and in her lap lay a little  child asleep.  Just as we stepped across the threshold the  executioner gave his machine a slight turn, which wrung a cry  from both the prisoner and the woman; but I shouted, and the  executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke.  I could not let this horror go on; it would have killed me to  see it.  I asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak  to the prisoner privately; and when she was going to object I spoke  in a low voice and said I did not want to make a scene before  her servants, but I must have my way; for I was King Arthur's  representative, and was speaking in his name.  She saw she had  to yield.  I asked her to indorse me to these people, and then  leave me.  It was not pleasant for her, but she took the pill;  and even went further than I was meaning to require.  I only wanted  the backing of her own authority; but she said:    \"Ye will do in all things as this lord shall command.  It is The Boss.\"    It was certainly a good word to conjure with: you could see it  by the squirming of these rats.  The queen's guards fell into line,  and she and they marched away, with their torch-bearers, and woke  the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their  retreating footfalls.  I had the prisoner taken from the rack and  placed upon his bed, and medicaments applied to his hurts, and  wine given him to drink.  The woman crept near and looked on,  eagerly, lovingly, but timorously,--like one who fears a repulse;  indeed, she tried furtively to touch the man's forehead, and jumped  back, the picture of fright, when I turned unconsciously toward  her.  It was pitiful to see.    \"Lord,\" I said, \"stroke him, lass, if you want to.  Do anything  you're a mind to; don't mind me.\"    Why, her eyes were as grateful as an animal's, when you do it  a kindness that it understands.  The baby was out of her way and  she had her cheek against the man's in a minute and her hands  fondling his hair, and her happy tears running down.  The man  revived and caressed his wife with his eyes, which was all he  could do.  I judged I might clear the den, now, and I did; cleared  it of all but the family and myself.  Then I said:    \"Now, my friend, tell me your side of this matter; I know  the other side.\"    The man moved his head in sign of refusal.  But the woman looked  pleased--as it seemed to me--pleased with my suggestion.  I went on--    \"You know of me?\"    \"Yes.  All do, in Arthur's realms.\"    \"If my reputation has come to you right and straight, you should  not be afraid to speak.\"    The woman broke in, eagerly:    \"Ah, fair my lord, do thou persuade him!  Thou canst an thou wilt.  Ah, he suffereth so; and it is for me--for _me_!  And how can I bear it?  I would I might see him die--a sweet, swift death; oh, my Hugo,  I cannot bear this one!\"    And she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet, and still  imploring.  Imploring what?  The man's death?  I could not quite  get the bearings of the thing.  But Hugo interrupted her and said:    \"Peace!  Ye wit not what ye ask.  Shall I starve whom I love,  to win a gentle death?  I wend thou knewest me better.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"I can't quite make this out.  It is a puzzle.  Now--\"    \"Ah, dear my lord, an ye will but persuade him!  Consider how  these his tortures wound me!  Oh, and he will not speak!--whereas,  the healing, the solace that lie in a blessed swift death--\"    \"What _are_ you maundering about?  He's going out from here a free  man and whole--he's not going to die.\"    The man's white face lit up, and the woman flung herself at me  in a most surprising explosion of joy, and cried out:    \"He is saved!--for it is the king's word by the mouth of the king's  servant--Arthur, the king whose word is gold!\"    \"Well, then you do believe I can be trusted, after all.  Why  didn't you before?\"    \"Who doubted?  Not I, indeed; and not she.\"    \"Well, why wouldn't you tell me your story, then?\"    \"Ye had made no promise; else had it been otherwise.\"    \"I see, I see....  And yet I believe I don't quite see, after all.  You stood the torture and refused to confess; which shows plain  enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing  to confess--\"    \"I, my lord?  How so?  It was I that killed the deer!\"    \"You _did_?  Oh, dear, this is the most mixed-up business that ever--\"    \"Dear lord, I begged him on my knees to confess, but--\"    \"You _did_!  It gets thicker and thicker.  What did you want him  to do that for?\"    \"Sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this  cruel pain.\"    \"Well--yes, there is reason in that.  But _he_ didn't want the  quick death.\"    \"He?  Why, of a surety he _did_.\"    \"Well, then, why in the world _didn't_ he confess?\"    \"Ah, sweet sir, and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter?\"    \"Oh, heart of gold, now I see it!  The bitter law takes the convicted  man's estate and beggars his widow and his orphans.  They could  torture you to death, but without conviction or confession they  could not rob your wife and baby.  You stood by them like a man;  and _you_--true wife and the woman that you are--you would have  bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow  starvation and death--well, it humbles a body to think what your  sex can do when it comes to self-sacrifice.  I'll book you both  for my colony; you'll like it there; it's a Factory where I'm going  to turn groping and grubbing automata into _men_.\"        CHAPTER XVIII    IN THE QUEEN'S DUNGEONS    Well, I arranged all that; and I had the man sent to his home.  I had a great desire to rack the executioner; not because he was  a good, painstaking and paingiving official,--for surely it was  not to his discredit that he performed his functions well--but to  pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that  young woman.  The priests told me about this, and were generously  hot to have him punished.  Something of this disagreeable sort  was turning up every now and then.  I mean, episodes that showed  that not all priests were frauds and self-seekers, but that many,  even the great majority, of these that were down on the ground  among the common people, were sincere and right-hearted, and  devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings.  Well, it was a thing which could not be helped, so I seldom fretted  about it, and never many minutes at a time; it has never been my  way to bother much about things which you can't cure.  But I did  not like it, for it was just the sort of thing to keep people  reconciled to an Established Church.  We _must_ have a religion  --it goes without saying--but my idea is, to have it cut up into  forty free sects, so that they will police each other, as had been  the case in the United States in my time.  Concentration of power  in a political machine is bad; and and an Established Church is  only a political machine; it was invented for that; it is nursed,  cradled, preserved for that; it is an enemy to human liberty, and  does no good which it could not better do in a split-up and scattered  condition.  That wasn't law; it wasn't gospel: it was only  an opinion--my opinion, and I was only a man, one man: so it wasn't  worth any more than the pope's--or any less, for that matter.    Well, I couldn't rack the executioner, neither would I overlook  the just complaint of the priests.  The man must be punished  somehow or other, so I degraded him from his office and made him  leader of the band--the new one that was to be started.  He begged  hard, and said he couldn't play--a plausible excuse,"]]]
