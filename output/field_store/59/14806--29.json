Nor am I, said my friend. What then could he have to do  with the circuit? It occurred to me he must be a Methodist  preacher. I looked again, but his appearance again puzzled  me. His attire might do--the colour might be suitable--the  broad brim not out of place; but there was a want of that  staidness of look, that seriousness of countenance, that  expression, in short, so characteristic of the clergy.  I could not account for my idle curiosity--a curiosity  which, in him, I had the moment before viewed both with  suspicion and disgust; but so it was--I felt a desire to  know who he could be who was neither lawyer nor preacher,  and yet talked of his circuit with the gravity of both.  How ridiculous, I thought to myself is this; I will leave  him. Turning towards him, I said, I feared I should be  late for breakfast, and must therefore bid him good  morning. Mohawk felt the pressure of my knees, and away  we went at a slapping pace. I congratulated myself on  conquering my own curiosity, and on avoiding that of my  travelling companion. This, I said to myself, this is  the value of a good horse; I patted his neck--I felt  proud of him. Presently I heard the steps of the unknown's  horse--the clatter increased. Ah, my friend, thought I,  it won't do; you should be well mounted if you desire my  company; I pushed Mohawk faster, faster, faster--to his  best. He outdid himself; he had never trotted so  handsomely--so easily--so well.    I guess that is a pretty considerable smart horse, said  the stranger, as he came beside me, and apparently reined  in, to prevent his horse passing me; there is not, I  reckon, so spry a one on MY CIRCUIT.    CIRCUIT, OR NO CIRCUIT, one thing was settled in my mind;  he was a Yankee, and a very impertinent Yankee, too. I  felt humbled, my pride was hurt, and Mohawk was beaten.  To continue this trotting contest was humiliating; I  yielded, therefore, before the victory was palpable, and  pulled up. Yes, continued he, a horse of pretty considerable  good action, and a pretty fair trotter, too, I guess.  Pride must have a fall--I confess mine was prostrate in  the dust. These words cut me to the heart. What! is it  come to this, poor Mohawk, that you, the admiration of  all but the envious, the great Mohawk, the standard by  which all other horses are measured--trots next to Mohawk,  only yields to Mohawk, looks like Mohawk--that you are,  after all, only a counterfeit, and pronounced by a  straggling Yankee to be merely 'a pretty fair trotter!'  If he was trained, I guess that he might be made do a  little more. Excuse me, but if you divide your weight  between the knee and the stirrup, rather most on the  knee, and rise forward on the saddle, so as to leave a  little daylight between you and it, I hope I may never  ride THIS CIRCUIT AGAIN, if you don't get a mile more an  hour out of him. What! not enough, I mentally groaned,  to have my horse beaten, but I must be told that I don't  know how to ride him; and that, too, by a Yankee--Aye,  there's the rub--a Yankee what? Perhaps a half-bred puppy,  half Yankee, half Blue Nose. As there is no escape, I'll  try to make out my riding master. YOUR CIRCUIT, said I,  my looks expressing all the surprise they were capable  of--your circuit, pray what may that be? Oh, said he,  the eastern circuit--I am on the eastern circuit, sir.  I have heard, said I, feeling that I now had a lawyer to  deal with, that there is a great deal of business on this  circuit--pray, are there many cases of importance? There  is a pretty fair business to be done, at least there has  been, but the cases are of no great value--we do not make  much out of them, we get them up very easy, but they  don't bring much profit. What a beast, thought I, is  this; and what a curse to a country, to have such an  unfeeling pettifogging rascal practising in it--a horse  jockey, too--what a finished character! I'll try him on  that branch of his business.    That is a superior animal you are mounted on, said I--I  seldom meet one that can travel with mine. Yes, said he  coolly, a considerable fair traveller, and most particular  good bottom. I hesitated, this man who talks with such  unblushing effrontery of getting up cases, and making  profit out of them, cannot be offended at the question  --yes, I will put it to him. Do you feel an inclination  to part with him? I never part with a horse sir, that  suits me, said he--I am fond of a horse--I don't like to  ride in the dust after every one I meet, and I allow no  man to pass me but when I choose. Is it possible, I  thought, that he can know me; that he has heard of my  foible, and is quizzing me, or have I this feeling in  common with him. But, continued I, you might supply  yourself again. Not on THIS CIRCUIT, I guess, said he,  nor yet in Campbell's circuit. Campbell's circuit--pray,  sir, what is that? That, said he, is the western--and  Lampton rides the shore circuit; and as for the people  on the shore, they know so little of horses, that Lampton  tells me, a man from Aylesford once sold a hornless ox  there, whose tail he had cut and nicked for a horse of  the Goliath breed. I should think, said I, that Mr.  Lampton must have no lack of cases among such enlightened  clients. Clients, sir, said my friend, Mr. Lampton is  not a lawyer. I beg pardon, I thought you said he rode  the CIRCUIT. We call it a circuit, said the stranger,  who seemed by no means flattered by the mistake--we divide  the Province, as in the Almanack, into circuits, in each  of which we separately carry on our business of  manufacturing and selling clocks. There are few, I guess,  said the Clockmaker, who go upon TICK as much as we do,  who have so little use for lawyers; if attornies could  wind a MAN UP AGAIN, after he has been fairly RUN DOWN,  I guess they'd be a pretty harmless sort of folks. This  explanation restored my good humour, and as I could not  quit my companion, and he did not feel disposed to leave  me, I made up my mind to travel with him to Fort Lawrence,  the limit of HIS CIRCUIT.          No. II    The Clock Maker.    I had heard of Yankee clock pedlars, tin pedlars, and  bible pedlars, especially of him who sold Polyglot Bibles  (ALL IN ENGLISH) to the amount of sixteen thousand pounds.  The house of every substantial farmer had three substantial  ornaments, a wooden clock, a tin reflector, and a Polyglot  Bible. How is it that an American can sell his wares, at  whatever price he pleases, where a Blue Nose would fail  to make a sale at all? I will enquire of the Clockmaker  the secret of his success. What a pity it is, Mr. SLICK,  (for such was his name,) what a pity it is, said I, that  you, who are so successful in teaching these people the  value of CLOCKS, could not also teach them the value of  TIME. I guess, said he, they have got that ring to grow  on their horns yet, which every four year old has in our  country. We reckon hours and minutes to be dollars and  cents. They do nothing in these parts, but eat, drink,  smoke, sleep, ride about, lounge at taverns, make speeches  at temperance meetings, and talk about \"House of Assembly.\"  If a man don't hoe his corn, and he don't get a crop, he  says it is all owing to the Bank; and if he runs into  debt and is sued, why says the lawyers are a curse to  the country. They are a most idle set of folks, I tell  you. But how is it, said I, that you manage to sell such  an immense number of clocks, (which certainly cannot be  called necessary articles,) among a people with whom  there seems to be so great a scarcity of money.    Mr. Slick paused, as if considering the propriety of  answering the question, and looking me in the face, said,  in a confidential tone, Why, I don't care if I do tell  you, for the market is glutted, and I shall quit this  circuit. It is done by a knowledge of SOFT SAWDER and  HUMAN NATUR. But here is Deacon Flint's, said he, I have  but one clock left, and I guess I will sell it to him.  At the gate of a most comfortable looking farm house  stood Deacon Flint, a respectable old man, who had  understood the value of time better than most of his  neighbours, if one might judge from the appearance of  every thing about him. After the usual salutation, an  invitation to \"alight\" was accepted by Mr. Slick, who  said, he wished to take leave of Mrs. Flint before he  left Colchester. We had hardly entered the house, before  the Clockmaker pointed to the view from the window, and,  addressing himself to me, said, if I was to tell them in  Connecticut, there was such a farm as this away down east  here in Nova Scotia, they would'nt believe me--why there  aint such a location in all New England. The deacon has  a hundred acres of dyke--seventy, said the deacon, only  seventy. Well, seventy; but then there is your fine deep  bottom, why I could run a ramrod into it--Interval, we  call it, said the Deacon, who, though evidently pleased  at this eulogium, seemed to wish the experiment of the  ramrod to be tried in the right place--well interval if  you please, (though Professor Eleazer Cumstick, in his  work on Ohio, calls them bottoms,) is just as good as  dyke. Then there is that water privilege, worth 3 or  $4,000, twice as good as what Governor Cass paid $15,000  for. I wonder, Deacon, you don't put up a carding mill  on it: the same works would carry a turning lathe, a  shingle machine, a circular saw, grind bark, and ----.  Too old, said the Deacon, too old for all those  speculations--old, repeated the clock-maker, not you;  why you are worth half a dozen of the young men we see,  now-a-days, you are young enough to have--here he said  something in a lower tone of voice, which I did not  distinctly hear; but whatever it was, the Deacon was  pleased, he smiled and said he did not think of such  things now.

PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.    THEY got amongst flower-pots, and frames and tubs; Peter heard noises  worse than ever, his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!    He was a step or two in front of his cousin, when he suddenly stopped.    THIS is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!    Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no  time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large  basket....    THE cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the  basket.    Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!    Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.    SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS.           *       *       *       *       *    I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket,  because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful;  it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.    The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the  afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.    AT length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of  mortar fell from the wall above.    The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top  of the wall of the upper terrace.    He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his  hand.    He was looking for his son.    OLD Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.    He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the  cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house,  scratching off a handful of fur.    The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.    WHEN old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked  the door.    Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the  ears, and whipped him with the little switch.    Then he took out his nephew Peter.    THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the  garden.    When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several  things which perplexed him.    It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in  a pair of clogs--only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little!    Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut  herself up INSIDE the green-house, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.    WHEN Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to  see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded  up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and  hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco.    THE END          THE TALE OF THE FLOPSY BUNNIES    FOR ALL LITTLE FRIENDS OF MR. McGREGOR & PETER & BENJAMIN      IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is \"soporific.\"    _I_ have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then _I_ am not a  rabbit.    They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!    WHEN Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a  large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.    I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were  generally called the \"Flopsy Bunnies.\"    AS there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow  cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.    SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.    WHEN this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a  rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.    MR. McGREGOR'S rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper  bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which  always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot  or two. One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces,  which had \"shot\" into flower.    THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after  another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown  grass.    Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep  he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep  off the flies.    THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the  lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing  machine. The blue-bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse  picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.    (I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a  woodmouse with a long tail.)    SHE rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.    The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.    WHILE she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a  heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a  sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy  Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a  jam pot.    THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of  grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.    They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.    Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny  little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He  stared at them for some time.    PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.    Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--    \"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\" said he as he dropped  them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was  turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but  still they did not wake up.    MR. McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.    He went to put away the mowing machine.    WHILE he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came  across the field.    She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?    THEN the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag  off his head, and they told the doleful tale.    Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.    But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the  bottom corner of the sack.    THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.    Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable  marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.    THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.    MR. McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.    He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.    The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.    THEY watched him go into his house.    And then they crept up to the window to listen.    MR. McGREGOR threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would  have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened  to have been inside it.    They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--    \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.    \"EH? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\" enquired Mrs.  McGregor.    \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr.  McGregor, counting on his fingers--\"one, two, three--\"    \"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"    \"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.    (The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)    MRS. McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel  six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all  different shapes.    \"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"    \"Line your old cloak?\" shouted Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them and buy  myself baccy!\"    \"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\"    MRS. McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.    When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that  Mr. McGregor had \"done it a purpose.\"    AND Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came  flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.    It was rather hurt.    THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.    SO Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get  her rabbit skins.    But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough  rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and  a pair of warm mittens.    THE END          IN REMEMBRANCE OF \"SAMMY,\" THE INTELLIGENT PINK-EYED REPRESENTATIVE OF A  PERSECUTED (BUT IRREPRESSIBLE) RACE. AN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE FRIEND. AND  MOST ACCOMPLISHED THIEF!    THE ROLY-POLY PUDDING      ONCE upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who  was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and  whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!    On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.    She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.    Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.  She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best  spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right  upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him  anywhere.    It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the  walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside  them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there  were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared  at night--especially cheese and bacon.    Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.    While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got  into mischief.    The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.    They went straight"]]]
