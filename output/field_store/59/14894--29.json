INDEX.                         *       *       *       *       *                               A COMPLETE GRAMMAR OF                                 ESPERANTO.                         *       *       *       *       *                                       LESSON I.                                     ALPHABET.    1. The Esperanto alphabet contains the following letters: a, b, c, cx,  d, e, f, g, gx, h, hx, i, j, jx, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, sx, t, u, ux,  v, z.                                      VOWELS.    2. The vowels of the alphabet are pronounced as follows:    \"a\" as in \"far\".    \"e\" as in \"fiance\", like \"a\" in \"fate\".    [Footnote: This \"long a\" sound in English frequently ends with a  vanish,--a brief terminal sound of \"short i\" which makes the vowel  slightly diphthongal, as in \"day\", \"aye\". Such a vanish must  not be given to any of the Esperanto vowels.]    \"i\" as in \"machine\".    \"o\" as in \"toll\", \"for\".    \"u\" as in \"rude\", \"rural\".                                    CONSONANTS.    3. The consonants \"b\", \"d\", \"f\", \"h\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"t\",  \"v\", \"z\", are pronounced as in English, and the remaining eleven as  follows:    \"c\" like \"ts\" in \"hats\", \"tsetse\".    \"cx\" like \"ch\" in \"chin\", \"much\".    \"g\" like \"g\" in \"go\", \"big\".    \"gx\" like \"g\" in \"gem\", \"j\" in \"jar\".    \"hx\" is produced by expelling the breath forcibly, with the throat only  partially open.    [Footnote: As in pronouncing German and Scotch \"ch\", Spanish \"j\", Irish  \"gh\", Russian \"x\", Classical Greek Greek: \"chi\" etc. There are only a  few words containing this consonant.]    \"j\" like \"y\" in \"yes\", \"beyond\".    \"jx\" like \"z\" in \"azure\", \"s\" in \"visual\".    \"r\" is slightly trilled or rolled.    \"s\" like \"s\" in \"see\", \"basis\".    \"sx\" like \"sh\" in \"shine\", \"rash\", \"ch\" in machine\".    \"ux\" like \"w\" or consonantal \"u\". See Diphthongs, 5.                               NAMES OF THE LETTERS.    4. The vowels are named by their sounds, as given in (2). The names  of the consonants are \"bo\", \"co\", \"cxo\", \"do\", \"fo\", \"go\", \"gxo\",  \"ho\", \"hxo\", \"jo\", \"jxo\", \"ko\", \"lo\", \"mo\", \"no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779"],[0,"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#2)"],[1," sea,       And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks,       Ay, all the wealth that our forefathers hid       Within the massy entrails of the earth:       Then tell me, Faustus, what shall we three want?         FAUSTUS. Nothing, Cornelius.  O, this cheers my soul!       Come, shew me some demonstrations magical,       That I may conjure in some lusty grove,       And have these joys in full possession.         VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove,       And bear wise Bacon's and Albertus'[42] works,       The Hebrew Psalter, and New Testament;       And whatsoever else is requisite       We will inform thee ere our conference cease.         CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art;       And then, all other ceremonies learn'd,       Faustus may try his cunning[43] by himself.         VALDES. First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments,       And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.         FAUSTUS. Then come and dine with me, and, after meat,       We'll canvass every quiddity thereof;       For, ere I sleep, I'll try what I can do:       This night I'll conjure, though I die therefore.            [Exeunt.]              Enter two SCHOLARS.[44]         FIRST SCHOLAR. I wonder what's become of Faustus, that was wont       to make our schools ring with sic probo.         SECOND SCHOLAR. That shall we know, for see, here comes his boy.              Enter WAGNER.         FIRST SCHOLAR. How now, sirrah! where's thy master?         WAGNER. God in heaven knows.         SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, dost not thou know?         WAGNER. Yes, I know; but that follows not.         FIRST SCHOLAR. Go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us       where he is.         WAGNER. That follows not necessary by force of argument, that you,       being licentiates, should stand upon:[45]  therefore acknowledge       your error, and be attentive.         SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, didst thou not say thou knewest?         WAGNER. Have you any witness on't?         FIRST SCHOLAR. Yes, sirrah, I heard you.         WAGNER. Ask my fellow if I be a thief.         SECOND SCHOLAR. Well, you will not tell us?         WAGNER. Yes, sir, I will tell you:  yet, if you were not dunces,       you would never ask me such a question; for is not he corpus       naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should you       ask me such a question?  But that I am by nature phlegmatic,       slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, I would say),       it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place       of execution, although I do not doubt to see you both hanged       the next sessions.  Thus having triumphed over you, I will set       my countenance like a precisian, and begin to speak thus:--       Truly, my dear brethren, my master is within at dinner,       with Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine, if it could speak,       would[46] inform your worships:  and so, the Lord bless you,       preserve you, and keep you, my dear brethren, my dear brethren![47]            [Exit.]         FIRST SCHOLAR. Nay, then, I fear he is fallen into that damned art       for which they two are infamous through the world.         SECOND SCHOLAR. Were he a stranger, and not allied to me, yet should       I grieve for him. But, come, let us go and inform the Rector,       and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him.         FIRST SCHOLAR. O, but I fear me nothing can reclaim him!         SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet let us try what we can do.            [Exeunt.]              Enter FAUSTUS to conjure.[48]         FAUSTUS. Now that the gloomy shadow of the earth,       Longing to view Orion's drizzling look,       Leaps from th' antartic world unto the sky,       And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath,       Faustus, begin thine incantations,       And try if devils will obey thy hest,       Seeing thou hast pray'd and sacrific'd to them.       Within this circle is Jehovah's name,       Forward and backward anagrammatiz'd,[49]       Th' abbreviated[50] names of holy saints,       Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,       And characters of signs and erring[51] stars,       By which the spirits are enforc'd to rise:       Then fear not, Faustus, but be resolute,       And try the uttermost magic can perform.--       Sint mihi dei Acherontis propitii!  Valeat numen triplex Jehovoe!       Ignei, aerii, aquatani spiritus, salvete!  Orientis princeps       Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha, et Demogorgon, propitiamus       vos, ut appareat et surgat Mephistophilis, quod tumeraris:[52]       per Jehovam, Gehennam, et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo,       signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vota nostra, ipse nunc       surgat nobis dicatus[53] Mephistophilis!              Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.         I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;       Thou art too ugly to attend on me:       Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;       That holy shape becomes a devil best.            [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]         I see there's virtue in my heavenly words:       Who would not be proficient in this art?       How pliant is this Mephistophilis,       Full of obedience and humility!       Such is the force of magic and my spells:       No, Faustus, thou art conjuror laureat,       That canst command great Mephistophilis:       Quin regis Mephistophilis fratris imagine.              Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.[54]         MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?         FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,       To do whatever Faustus shall command,       Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,       Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.         MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,       And may not follow thee without his leave:       No more than he commands must we perform.         FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?         MEPHIST. No, I came hither[55] of mine own accord.         FAUSTUS. Did not my conjuring speeches raise thee? speak.         MEPHIST. That was the cause, but yet per accidens;[56]       For, when we hear one rack the name of God,       Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,       We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;       Nor will we come, unless he use such means       Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd.       Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring       Is stoutly to abjure the Trinity,       And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.         FAUSTUS. So Faustus hath       Already done; and holds this principle,       There is no chief but only Belzebub;       To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself.       This word \"damnation\" terrifies not him,       For he confounds hell in Elysium:       His ghost be with the old philosophers!       But, leaving these vain trifles of men's souls,       Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord?         MEPHIST. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.         FAUSTUS. Was not that Lucifer an angel once?         MEPHIST. Yes, Faustus, and most dearly lov'd of God.         FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?         MEPHIST. O, by aspiring pride and insolence;       For which God threw him from the face of heaven.         FAUSTUS. And what are you that live with Lucifer?         MEPHIST. Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer,       Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer,       And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer.         FAUSTUS. Where are you damn'd?         MEPHIST. In hell.         FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?         MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:[57]       Think'st thou that I, who saw the face of God,       And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,       Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,       In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?       O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,       Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!         FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate       For being deprived of the joys of heaven?       Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,       And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.       Go bear these[58] tidings to great Lucifer:       Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death       By desperate thoughts against Jove's[59] deity,       Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,       So he will spare him four and twenty[60] years,       Letting him live in all voluptuousness;       Having thee ever to attend on me,       To give me whatsoever I shall ask,       To tell me whatsoever I demand,       To slay mine enemies, and aid my friends,       And always be obedient to my will.       Go and return to mighty Lucifer,       And meet me in my study at midnight,       And then resolve[61] me of thy master's mind.         MEPHIST. I will, Faustus.            [Exit.]         FAUSTUS. Had I as many souls as there be stars,       I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.       By him I'll be great emperor of the world,       And make a bridge thorough[62] the moving air,       To pass the ocean with a band of men;       I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore,       And make that country[63] continent to Spain,       And both contributory to my crown:       The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,       Nor any potentate of Germany.       Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd,[64]       I'll live in speculation of this art,       Till Mephistophilis return again.            [Exit.]              Enter WAGNER[65] and CLOWN.         WAGNER. Sirrah boy, come hither.         CLOWN. How, boy! swowns, boy!  I hope you have seen many boys       with such pickadevaunts[66] as I have:  boy, quotha!         WAGNER. Tell me, sirrah, hast thou any comings in?         CLOWN. Ay, and goings out too; you may see else.         WAGNER. Alas, poor slave! see how poverty jesteth in his nakedness!       the villain is bare and out of service, and so hungry, that I know       he would give his soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton,       though it were blood-raw.         CLOWN."]]]
