Before Sish is Kib, and behind him goeth Mung.    Very pleasant are all things before the face of Sish, but behind  him they are withered and old.    And Sish goeth ceaselessly upon his way.    Once the gods walked upon Earth as men walk and spake with their  mouths like Men. That was in Wornath-Mavai. They walk not now.    And Wornath-Mavai was a garden fairer than all the gardens upon  Earth.    Kib was propitious, and Mung raised not his hand against it,  neither did Sish assail it with his hours.    Wornath-Mavai lieth in a valley and looketh towards the south, and  on the slopes of it Sish rested among the flowers when Sish was  young.    Thence Sish went forth into the world to destroy its cities, and  to provoke his hours to assail all things, and to batter against  them with the rust and with the dust.    And Time, which is the hound of Sish, devoured all things; and  Sish sent up the ivy and fostered weeds, and dust fell from the  hand of Sish and covered stately things. Only the valley where  Sish rested when he and Time were young did Sish not provoke his  hours to assail.    There he restrained his old hound Time, and at its borders Mung  withheld his footsteps.    Wornath-Mavai still lieth looking towards the south, a garden  among gardens, and still the flowers grow about its slopes as they  grew when the gods were young; and even the butterflies live in  Wornath-Mavai still. For the minds of the gods relent towards  their earliest memories, who relent not otherwise at all.    Wornath-Mavai still lieth looking towards the south; but if thou  shouldst ever find it thou art then more fortunate than the gods,  because they walk not in Wornath-Mavai now.    Once did the prophet think that he discerned it in the distance  beyond mountains, a garden exceeding fair with flowers; but Sish  arose, and pointed with his hand, and set his hound to pursue him,  who hath followed ever since.    Time is the hound of the gods; but it hath been said of old that  he will one day turn upon his masters, and seek to slay the gods,  excepting only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, whose dreams are the gods  themselves--dreamed long ago.        THE SAYINGS OF SLID    (Whose Soul is by the Sea)      Slid said: \"Let no man pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, for who shall  trouble MANA with mortal woes or irk him with the sorrows of all  the houses of Earth?    \"Nor let any sacrifice to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, for what glory shall  he find in sacrifices or altars who hath made the gods themselves?    \"Pray to the small gods, who are the gods of Doing; but MANA is  the god of Having Done--the god of Having Done and of the Resting.    \"Pray to the small gods and hope that they may hear thee. Yet what  mercy should the small gods have, who themselves made Death and  Pain; or shall they restrain their old hound Time for thee?    \"Slid is but a small god. Yet Slid is Slid--it is written and hath  been said.    \"Pray, thou, therefore, to Slid, and forget not Slid, and it may  be that Slid will not forget to send thee Death when most thou  needest it.\"    And the People of Earth said: \"There is a melody upon the Earth as  though ten thousand streams all sang together for their homes that  they had forsaken in the hills.\"    And Slid said: \"I am the Lord of gliding waters and of foaming  waters and of still. I am the Lord of all the waters in the world  and all that long streams garner in the hills; but the soul of  Slid is in the Sea. Thither goes all that glides upon Earth, and  the end of all the rivers is the Sea.\"    And Slid said: \"The hand of Slid hath toyed with cataracts, and  down the valleys have trod the feet of Slid, and out of the lakes  of the plains regard the eyes of Slid; but the soul of Slid is in  the sea.\"    Much homage hath Slid among the cities of men and pleasant are the  woodland paths and the paths of the plains, and pleasant the high  valleys where he danceth in the hills; but Slid would be fettered  neither by banks nor boundaries--so the soul of Slid is in the  Sea.    For there may Slid repose beneath the sun and smile at the gods  above him with all the smiles of Slid, and be a happier god than  Those who sway the Worlds, whose work is Life and Death.    There may he sit and smile, or creep among the ships, or moan and  sigh round islands in his great content--the miser lord of wealth  in gems and pearls beyond the telling of all fables.    Or there may he, when Slid would fain exult, throw up his great  arms, or toss with many a fathom of wandering hair the mighty head  of Slid, and cry aloud tumultuous dirges of shipwreck, and feel  through all his being the crashing might of Slid, and sway the  sea. Then doth the Sea, like venturous legions on the eve of war  that exult to acclaim their chief, gather its force together from  under all the winds and roar and follow and sing and crash  together to vanquish all things--and all at the bidding of Slid,  whose soul is in the sea.    There is ease in the soul of Slid and there be calms upon the sea;  also, there be storms upon the sea and troubles in the soul of  Slid, for the gods have many moods. And Slid is in many places,  for he sitteth in high Pegana. Also along the valleys walketh  Slid, wherever water moveth or lieth still; but the voice and the  cry of Slid are from the sea. And to whoever that cry hath ever  come he must needs follow and follow, leaving all stable things;  only to be always with Slid in all the moods of Slid, to find no  rest until he reaches the sea.    With the cry of Slid before them and the hills of their home behind  have gone a hundred thousand to the sea, over whose bones doth Slid  lament with the voice of a god lamenting for his people. Even the  streams from the inner lands have heard Slid's far-off cry, and all  together have forsaken lawns and trees to follow where Slid is  gathering up his own, to rejoice where Slid rejoices, singing the  chaunt of Slid, even as will at the Last gather all the Lives of  the People about the feet of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.        THE DEEDS OF MUNG    (Lord of all Deaths between Pegana and the Rim)      Once, as Mung went his way athwart the Earth and up and down its  cities and across its plains, Mung came upon a man who was afraid  when Mung said: \"I am Mung!\"    And Mung said: \"Were the forty million years before thy coming  intolerable to thee?\"    And Mung said: \"Not less tolerable to thee shall be the forty  million years to come!\"    Then Mung made against him the sign of Mung and the Life of the  Man was fettered no longer with hands and feet.    At the end of the flight of the arrow there is Mung, and in the  houses and the cities of Men. Mung walketh in all places at all  times. But mostly he loves to walk in the dark and still, along  the river mists when the wind hath sank, a little before night  meeteth with the morning upon the highway between Pegana and  the Worlds.    Sometimes Mung entereth the poor man's cottage; Mung also boweth  very low before The King. Then do the Lives of the poor man and of  The King go forth among the Worlds.    And Mung said: \"Many turnings hath the road that Kib hath given  every man to tread upon the earth. Behind one of these turnings  sitteth Mung.\"    One day as a man trod upon the road that Kib had given him to  tread he came suddenly upon Mung. And when Mung said: \"I am Mung!\"  the man cried out: \"Alas, that I took this road, for had I gone by  any other way then had I not met with Mung.\"    And Mung said: \"Had it been possible for thee to go by any other  way then had the Scheme of Things been otherwise and the gods had  been other gods. When MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI forgets to rest and makes  again new gods it may be that They will send thee again into the  Worlds; and then thou mayest choose some other way, and not meet  with Mung.\"    Then Mung made the sign of Mung. And the Life of that man went  forth with yesterday's regrets and all old sorrows and forgotten  things--whither Mung knoweth.    And Mung went onward with his work to sunder Life from flesh, and  Mung came upon a man who became stricken with sorrow when he saw  the shadow of Mung. But Mung said: \"When at the sign of Mung thy  Life shall float away there will also disappear thy sorrow at  forsaking it.\" But the man cried out: \"O Mung! tarry for a little,  and make not the sign of Mung against me now, for I have a family  upon the earth with whom sorrow will remain, though mine should  disappear because of the sign of Mung.\"    And Mung said: \"With the gods it is always Now. And before Sish  hath banished many of the years the sorrows of thy family for thee  shall go the way of thine.\" And the man beheld Mung making the  sign of Mung before his eyes, which beheld things no more.        THE CHAUNT OF THE PRIESTS      This is the chaunt of the Priests.    The chaunt of the priests of Mung.    This is the chaunt of the Priests.    All day long to Mung cry out the Priests of Mung, and, yet Mung  harkeneth not. What, then, shall avail the prayers of All the  People?    Rather bring gifts to the Priests, gifts to the Priests of Mung.    So shall they cry louder unto Mung than ever was their wont.    And it may be that Mung shall hear.    Not any longer than shall fall the Shadow of Mung athwart the  hopes of the People.    Not any longer then shall the Tread of Mung darken the dreams of  the people.    Not any longer shall the lives of the People be loosened because  of Mung.    Bring ye gifts to the Priests, gifts to the Priests of Mung.    This is the chaunt of the Priests.    The chaunt of the Priests of Mung.    This is the chaunt of the Priests.        THE SAYINGS OF LIMPANG-TUNG    (The God of Mirth and of Melodious Minstrels)      And Limpang-Tung said: \"The ways of the gods are strange. The  flower groweth up and the flower fadeth away. This may be very  clever of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#2)"],[1,"of  cheap guns, revolving pistols, swords, cheap cutlery of all sorts,  beads, cotton stuffs of a variety of kinds, and sewing material, &c.  &c. &c., to the amount of £390 sterling. Arrived at Aden, my first  step was to visit Colonel Outram, the political resident, to open my  views to him with regard to penetrating Africa, and to solicit his  assistance to my doing so, by granting introductory letters to the  native chiefs on the coast, and in any other manner that he could. But  to my utter astonishment and discomfiture, with the frank and  characteristic ardour which has marked him through life, he at once  said he would not only withhold his influence, but would prohibit my  going there at all, as the countries opposite to Aden were so  extremely dangerous for any foreigners to travel in, that he  considered it his duty as a Christian to prevent, as far as he was  able, anybody from hazarding his life there. This opposition,  fortunately, only lasted for a time. After repeated supplications on  my part, the generous kind nature of the Colonel overcame him, and he  thought of a pretext by which, should anything serious happen to me,  there would not remain any onus on his conscience.    The Bombay Government at that time had been induced to order an  expedition to be organised for the purpose of investigating the Somali  country--a large tract of land lying due south of Aden, and separated  only from the Arabian coast by the Gulf of Aden--and had appointed  three officers, Lieutenant Burton to command, and Lieutenants Stroyan  and Herne to assist in its conduct. To this project Colonel Outram had  ever been adverse, and he had remonstrated with the Government about  it, declaring, as his opinion, the scheme to be quite unfeasible. The  Somali, he said, were the most savage of all African savages, and were  of such a wild and inhospitable nature that no stranger could possibly  live amongst them. The Government, however, relying on the ability of  one who made the pilgrimage of Mecca, were bent at least on giving the  Lieutenant a chance of showing what he could do in this even darker  land, and he was then occupied in Aden maturing his plans of  procedure.[2]    This, then, was the opportunity the Colonel took advantage of,  advising me to ask Lieutenant Burton to incorporate me in his  expedition, at the same time saying that, if it was found to be  agreeable to Lieutenant Burton, he would back my application to the  Indian Government, obtain a cancel of my furlough, and get me put on  service-duty as a member of the expedition.    Nothing could have suited me better, as it brought me on service  again, and so saved my furlough leave for a future exploration.  Lieutenant Burton consented, and I was at once installed in the  expedition. My travelling, mapping,[3] and collecting propensities, it  was thought would be of service to the ends of the expedition; and by  my being incorporated in it, there would be no chance of my running  counter to it, by travelling on its line of march, and possibly giving  rise to disturbances with the natives.    Before proceeding further in the narrative of events as they occurred,  it may be as well, perhaps, to anticipate a little, and give a general  impression of the geography, ethnology, history, and other  characteristics of the country under investigation--the Somali  land--and the way in which it was intended that those investigations  should be carried out. As will appear by the following pages, my  experiences were mostly confined to the north central parts, in the  highlands of the Warsingali and Dulbahanta tribes. The rest of my  information is derived from conversations with the natives, or what I  have read in some very interesting pages in vol. xix. of the  'Transactions of the Royal Geographical Society,' written by  Lieutenant Cruttenden.    The Somali country is an elbow of land lying between the equator and  the 11th degree of north latitude, which, from its peculiar form,  might well be designated the Eastern Horn of Africa. The land is high  in the north, and has a general declination, as may be seen by the  river system, to the south and eastward, but with less easting as we  come westward.    It is separated from the main body of Africa by the river Jub, a large  and fertilising stream, which, rising in the mountains of southern  Abyssinia, passes between the territories of the Gallas on the west  and the Somali on the east, and debouches in the Indian Ocean at the  northern extremity of the Zanzibar coast. According to Lieutenant  Cruttenden's map, there are only two other rivers besides this of any  consequence in the land,--the Webbe (river) Shebéli, or Haines river,  which is of considerable importance, having a large flow of water,  trending down a cultivable district of rich red soil, and another less  important to the eastward of these two, called very unfortunately by  him the Wadi[4] Nogal. The proper specific name for this river has  never, to my knowledge, been given; but the Jid Ali Tug is one of its  head branches. It rises in some small hills close overhanging the  north coast, and runs south-easterly into the Indian Ocean, dividing  two large territories, called Ugahden, or Haud, on the west, and Nogal  on the east, mouthing at Ras Ul Khylé. Ugahden is said to be a flat  grassy country, of red soil, almost stoneless, and having water  everywhere near the surface. It is considered by the pastoral Somali a  famous place for keeping cattle, of which by report they possess a  great abundance, such as camels, ponies, cows, and Dumba sheep--a  fat-tailed animal, like the Persian breed. Game also abounds in this  country, of which the gazelles and antelopes, I was assured, roamed  about in vast herds like sheep.    The Nogal country is the opposite of this, containing nothing of any  material value in it. The rock-formation is all lime, very pure and  white like marble, which consequently makes the soil white, and, being  very stony, it is almost barren. The Somali keep cattle here, but with  much apparent difficulty, being, from the scarcity of springs and want  of water, obliged to march about, following the last falls of rain, to  obtain fresh herbage for their cattle. My first and greater journey  gave me an insight into this portion of the interior of the country  south of Bunder Gori. It was very interesting, though not profitable,  from its never having been visited by any Europeans before. I observed  here two distinct leading features in its physical geography. The  first is a narrow hill-range, about 180 miles long and 20 or more  broad, which is occupied by two large tribes--the Warsingali on the  east, and a branch of the Habr Gerhajis on the west. It is situated at  an average distance of from 200 yards to three or four miles from the  sea-shore, separated from it by a sandy flat or maritime plain, and,  like the line of coast, extends from east to west. Immediately due  south of Bunder Gori, the sea-face, or northern slopes of this range,  are very steep and irregular, being trenched down by deep ravines,  which, during the rainy season, shed their water across the maritime  plain into the Gulf of Aden.    The lower folds on this side of the range are composed of brown rocks  and earth, having little or no vegetation upon them, and are just as  uninviting in appearance as the light-brown hills which fringe the  coast of Arabia, as seen by voyagers on the Red Sea. Further up the  hill, in the central folds of the range, this great sterility changes  for a warm rich clothing of bush-jungle and a little grass. Gum-trees,  myrrh, and some varieties of the frankincense are found in great  profusion, as well as a variety of the aloe plant, from which the  Somali manufacture good strong cordage. The upper part of the range is  very steep and precipitous, and on this face is well clad with trees  and bush-jungle. The southern side of the range is exactly the  opposite, in all its characteristics, of the northern. Instead of  having a steep drop of from 6000 to 7000 feet, it falls by gentle  slopes to successive terraces, like a giant staircase, to scarcely  half that depth, where it rests at the head of the high plateau land  of Nogal, and is almost barren. Nogal, as I have said before, is also  very barren, only producing trees, such as the hardy acacia and  jujube, in sheltered places, in the valleys or watercourses which  drain that land to the south-east. I had no means of determining it,  but should judge this second great geographical feature, the plateau  of Nogal, by the directions its streams lie in, to have a gradual  decreasing declination, like all the rest of the interior, from the  north, where it averages an altitude of from 3000 to 4000 feet, down  to the level of the sea on south and by east.    According to traditional histories furnished me by the natives who  accompanied me on the journeys I undertook, it appears that the  present Somali are of rather recent origin, not more than four and a  half centuries old. About the year 1413, an Arab chieftain,  Darud-bin-Ismail, who had been disputing with an elder brother for  certain territorial rights at Mecca, was overpowered and driven from  the Mussulman Holy Land, and marched southwards, accompanied by a  large number of faithful followers,--amongst whom was an Asyri damsel,  of gentle blood and interesting beauty, whom he subsequently  married,--to Makallah, on the southern shores of Arabia. Once arrived  there, this band of vanquished fugitives hired vessels, and, crossing  the Gulf of Aden, came to Bunder Gori. Here they were hospitably  received by the then governing people, who, for the most part, were  Christians--probably Gallas and Abyssinians--who, judging from the few  archaeological remains they subsequently left behind them, must have  lived in a far more advanced state of civilisation than the present  Somali enjoy. Those Christian people were "]]]
