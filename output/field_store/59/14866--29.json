About dinner-time I encountered the  Giraffe and his hat, with two half-crowns in it for a start.    \"I'm sorry to trouble yer,\" he said, \"but One-eyed Bogan carn't pay his  fine, an' I thought we might fix it up for him. He ain't half a bad sort  of feller when he ain't drinkin'. It's only when he gets too much booze  in him.\"    After shearing, the hat usually started round with the Giraffe's own  dirty crumpled pound note in the bottom of it as a send-off, later on it  was half a sovereign, and so on down to half a crown and a shilling,  as he got short of stuff; till in the end he would borrow a \"few  bob\"--which he always repaid after next shearing-\"just to start the  thing goin'.\"    There were several yarns about him and his hat. 'Twas said that the hat  had belonged to his father, whom he resembled in every respect, and it  had been going round for so many years that the crown was worn as thin  as paper by the quids, half-quids, casers, half-casers, bobs and tanners  or sprats--to say nothing of the scrums--that had been chucked into it  in its time and shaken up.    They say that when a new governor visited Bourke the Giraffe happened to  be standing on the platform close to the exit, grinning good-humouredly,  and the local toady nudged him urgently and said in an awful whisper,  \"Take off your hat! Why don't you take off your hat?\"    \"Why?\" drawled the Giraffe, \"he ain't hard up, is he?\"    And they fondly cherish an anecdote to the effect that, when the  One-Man-One-Vote Bill was passed (or Payment of Members, or when the  first Labour Party went in--I forget on which occasion they said it was)  the Giraffe was carried away by the general enthusiasm, got a few beers  in him, \"chucked\" a quid into his hat, and sent it round. The boys  contributed by force of habit, and contributed largely, because of the  victory and the beer. And when the hat came back to the Giraffe, he  stood holding it in front of him with both hands and stared blankly into  it for a while. Then it dawned on him.    \"Blowed if I haven't bin an' gone an' took up a bloomin' collection for  meself!\" he said.     He was almost a teetotaller, but he stood his shout in reason.  He  mostly drank ginger beer.    \"I ain't a feller that boozes, but I ain't got nothin' agen chaps  enjoyin' themselves, so long as they don't go too far.\"    It was common for a man on the spree to say to him:    \"Here! here's five quid. Look after it for me, Giraffe, will yer, till I  git off the booze.    \"His real name was Bob Brothers, and his bush names, 'Long-'un,' 'The  Giraffe,' 'Send-round-the-hat,' 'Chuck-in-a-bob,' and 'Ginger-ale.'\"    Some years before, camels and Afghan drivers had been imported to the  Bourke district; the camels did very well in the dry country, they  went right across country and carried everything from sardines to  flooring-boards. And the teamsters loved the Afghans nearly as much as  Sydney furniture makers love the cheap Chinese in the same line.  They love 'em even as union shearers on strike love blacklegs brought  up-country to take their places.    Now the Giraffe was a good, straight unionist, but in cases of sickness  or trouble he was as apt to forget his unionism, as all bushmen are, at  all times (and for all time), to forget their creed. So, one evening,  the Giraffe blundered into the Carriers' Arms--of all places in the  world--when it was full of teamsters; he had his hat in his hand and  some small silver and coppers in it.    \"I say, you fellers, there's a poor, sick Afghan in the camp down there  along the--\"    A big, brawny bullock-driver took him firmly by the shoulders, or,  rather by the elbows, and ran him out before any damage was done. The  Giraffe took it as he took most things, good-humouredly; but, about  dusk, he was seen slipping down towards the Afghan camp with a billy of  soup.    \"I believe,\" remarked Tom Hall, \"that when the Giraffe goes to  heaven--and he's the only one of us, as far as I can see, that has a  ghost of a show--I believe that when he goes to heaven, the first  thing he'll do will be to take his infernal hat round amongst the  angels--getting up a collection for this damned world that he left  behind.\"    \"Well, I don't think there's so much to his credit, after all,\" said  Jack Mitchell, shearer. \"You see, the Giraffe is ambitious; he likes  public life, and that accounts for him shoving himself forward with  his collections. As for bothering about people in trouble, that's only  common curiosity; he's one of those chaps that are always shoving their  noses into other people's troubles. And, as for looking after sick  men--why! there's nothing the Giraffe likes better than pottering round  a sick man, and watching him and studying him. He's awfully interested  in sick men, and they're pretty scarce out here. I tell you there's  nothing he likes better--except, maybe, it's pottering round a corpse. I  believe he'd ride forty miles to help and sympathize and potter round  a funeral. The fact of the matter is that the Giraffe is only enjoying  himself with other people's troubles--that's all it is. It's only vulgar  curiosity and selfishness. I set it down to his ignorance; the way he  was brought up.\"    A few days after the Afghan incident the Giraffe and his hat had a run  of luck. A German, one of a party who were building a new wooden bridge  over the Big Billabong, was helping unload some girders from a truck at  the railway station, when a big log slipped on the skids and his leg  was smashed badly. They carried him to the Carriers' Arms, which was  the nearest hotel, and into a bedroom behind the bar, and sent for the  doctor. The Giraffe was in evidence as usual.    \"It vas not that at all,\" said German Charlie, when they asked him if he  was in much pain. \"It vas not that at all. I don't cares a damn for der  bain; but dis is der tird year--und I vas going home dis year--after der  gontract--und der gontract yoost commence!\"`    That was the burden of his song all through, between his groans. There  were a good few chaps sitting quietly about the bar and veranda when the  doctor arrived. The Giraffe was sitting at the end of the counter, on  which he had laid his hat while he wiped his face, neck, and forehead  with a big speckled \"sweatrag.\" It was a very hot day.    The doctor, a good-hearted young Australian, was heard saying something.  Then German Charlie, in a voice that rung with pain:    \"Make that leg right, doctor--quick! Dis is der tird pluddy year--und I  must go home!\"    The doctor asked him if he was in great pain. \"Neffer mind der pluddy  bain, doctor! Neffer mind der pluddy bain! Dot vas nossing. Make dat leg  well quick, doctor. Dis vas der last gontract, and I vas going home dis  year.\" Then the words jerked out of him by physical agony: \"Der girl vas  vaiting dree year, und--by Got! I must go home.\"    The publican--Watty Braithwaite, known as \"Watty Broadweight,\" or, more  familiarly, \"Watty Bothways\"--turned over the Giraffe's hat in a tired,  bored sort of way, dropped a quid into it, and nodded resignedly at the  Giraffe.    The Giraffe caught up the hint and the hat with alacrity. The hat went  all round town, so to speak; and, as soon as his leg was firm enough not  to come loose on the road German Charlie went home.    It was well known that I contributed to the Sydney _Bulletin_ and  several other papers. The Giraffe's bump of reverence was very large,  and swelled especially for sick men and poets. He treated me with much  more respect than is due from a bushman to a man, and with an odd sort  of extra gentleness I sometimes fancied. But one day he rather surprised  me.    \"I'm sorry to trouble yer,\" he said in a shamefaced way. \"I don't know  as you go in for sportin', but One-eyed Bogan an' Barcoo-Rot is goin' to  have a bit of a scrap down the Billybong this evenin', an'----\"    \"A bit of a what?\" I asked.    \"A bit of fight to a finish,\" he said apologetically. \"An' the chaps is  tryin' to fix up a fiver to put some life into the thing. There's bad  blood between One-eyed Bogan and Barcoo-Rot, an' it won't do them any  harm to have it out.\"    It was a great fight, I remember. There must have been a couple of score  blood-soaked handkerchiefs (or \"sweat-rags\") buried in a hole on the  field of battle, and the Giraffe was busy the rest of the evening  helping to patch up the principals. Later on he took up a small  collection for the loser, who happened to be Barcoo-Rot in spite of the  advantage of an eye.    The Salvation Army lassie, who went round with the _War Cry_, nearly  always sold the Giraffe three copies.    A new-chum parson, who wanted a subscription to build or enlarge a  chapel, or something, sought the assistance of the Giraffe's influence  with his mates.    \"Well,\" said the Giraffe, \"I ain't a churchgoer meself. I ain't what you  might call a religious cove, but I'll be glad to do what I can to help  yer. I don't suppose I can do much. I ain't been to church since I was a  kiddy.\"    The parson was shocked, but later on he learned to appreciate the  Giraffe and his mates, and to love Australia for the bushman's sake, and  it was he who told me the above anecdote.    The Giraffe helped fix some stalls for a Catholic Church bazaar, and  some of the chaps chaffed him about it in the union office.    \"You'll be taking up a collection for a joss-house down in the  Chinamen's camp next,\" said Tom Hall in conclusion.    \"Well, I ain't got nothin' agen the Roming Carflics,\" said the Giraffe.  \"An' Father O'Donovan's a very decent sort of cove. He stuck up for the  unions all right in the strike anyway.\" (\"He wouldn't be Irish if he  wasn't,\" someone commented.) \"I carried swags once for six months with  a feller that was a Carflick, an' he was a very straight feller. And  a girl I knowed turned Carflick"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#2)"],[1,"is an Indian, and has, I am convinced, a  knowledge of some of these places. He was with me all the time I was  out there. I saved his life when a puma sprang upon him, and he more  than once hinted that he could make me a rich man, but I had no  inclination that way, my income being sufficient for all my wants.  Still, on the chance that he is alive--and he was about thirty when he  was with me fifteen years ago, so it is probable that he is still to  the fore--I will give you a letter to him telling him that you are a  dear friend of mine, and that I trust to him to do any service he can  for you just as he would have done for myself. Had it not been for that  I should never have mentioned the matter to you. These old mines are  the dream of every Peruvian. They have been searching for them ever  since the conquest of the country, and as they have failed, it is  absurd to think that an Englishman would have the slightest chance of  lighting upon a mine, still less of finding any of the Incas'  treasures. But with the Indian's aid it is just possible that you may  find something, though I should advise you most strongly not to build  in any way upon the chance. I consider that you cannot possibly win  Miss Fortescue; that being so, two years of knocking about will not  make your position worse, and by the time you come back, you may have  ceased to struggle against fate. It will afford you a remote--but  distinctly remote--opportunity of bettering your position, will give  you something else to think about besides that young lady's charms, and  you may even come to recognize that life is, after all, possible  without her. You may shake your head, lad; but you know children cry  for the moon sometimes, yet afterwards come to understand that it would  not be a desirable plaything.\"    \"Well, at any rate, Mr. Barnett, I am extremely obliged for your  suggestion and for your offer of introductions. It is just the life  that I should enjoy thoroughly. As you say, the chance that anything  will come of it is extremely small, but at least there is a  possibility, and I take it as a drowning man catches at a straw.\"    \"By the way, you mustn't think only of gold; silver is, after all, the  chief source of the riches of Peru, and there are numbers of  extraordinarily rich mines. It is calculated that three hundred  millions have been produced since the first occupation by the  Spaniards. Quicksilver is also very abundant; copper and lead are found  too, but there is not much to be done with them at present, owing to  the cost of carriage. There is good shooting in the mountains on the  eastern side of the Andes, and you will find plenty of sport there.\"    They talked over the matter for some time before they separated, and  Harry Prendergast became quite excited over it. On his return to his  rooms he was astonished to find the candles alight and a strong smell  of tobacco pervading the place. A lad of about sixteen leapt from the  easy-chair in which he had been sitting, with his feet on another.    \"Hullo, Harry, I didn't expect you back so soon! The maid said you were  dining out, and I suppose that generally means one o'clock before you  are back.\"    \"Well, what brings you here, Bert? I thought I had got you off my hands  for a year at least.\"    \"I thought so, myself,\" the lad said coolly; \"but circumstances have  been too strong for me. We were running down the Channel the night  before last, when a craft that was beating up ran smack into us. I  don't know that it was his fault more than ours; the night was dark,  and it was very thick, and we did not see each other until she was  within a length of us. Luck was against us; if she had been a few  seconds quicker we should have caught her broadside, but as it was she  rammed us, knocking a hole in our side as big as a house, and we had  just time to jump on board her. Our old craft went down two minutes  after the skipper, who was of course the last man, left her. The other  fellow had stove his bow in. Luckily we were only about a couple of  miles off Dungeness, and though she leaked like a sieve, we were able  to run her into the bay, where she settled down in two and a half  fathoms of water. As soon as it was light we landed and tramped to  Dover. A hoy was starting for the river that evening, and most of us  came up in her, arriving at the Pool about three hours ago. It is a bad  job, Harry, and I am horribly put out about it. Of course nothing could  be saved, and there is all the new kit you bought for me down at the  bottom. I sha'n't bother you again; I have quite made up my mind that I  shall ship before the mast this time, and a five-pound note will buy me  a good enough outfit for that.\"    \"We need not talk about that now, Bertie. You are certainly an unlucky  beggar; this is the second time you have been wrecked.\"    \"It is a frightful nuisance,\" the boy said. \"It is the kit I am  thinking of, otherwise I should not mind. I didn't care for the  skipper. He seemed all right and decent enough before we started, but I  soon heard from fellows who had sailed with him before that he was a  tartar; and what was worse, they said he was in the habit of being  drunk two nights out of three. However, that has nothing to do with it.  I am really awfully sorry, Harry. You have been a thundering good elder  brother. I hated to think that you had to shell out last time, and I  have quite made up my mind that you sha'n't do it again.\"    \"Well, it cannot be helped; it is no fault of yours; still, of course,  it is a nuisance. Thank God that no harm has come to you, that is the  principal thing. Now, sit down and go on with your pipe, you young  monkey. I did not think you had taken to smoking.\"    \"One has to,\" the lad said, \"everyone else does it; and there is no  doubt that, when you have got the middle watch on cold nights with foul  winds, it is a comfort.\"    \"Well, go on smoking,\" his brother said. \"I will light up too. Now shut  your mouth altogether. I want to think.\"    They were silent for fully ten minutes, then Harry said;    \"I told you about that business of mine with Miss Fortescue.\"    Bertie grinned all over his face, which, as he sat, was not visible to  his brother. Then with preternatural gravity he turned towards him.    \"Yes, you told me about it; an uncomfortable business wasn't it?--surly  old father, lovely daughter, and so on.\"    \"I will pull your ear for you, you young scamp,\" Harry said wrathfully,  \"if you make fun of it; and I have a good mind not to say what I was  going to.\"    \"Say it, Harry, don't mind my feelings,\" the lad said. \"You can't say I  did not stand it well when I was here last week, and gave you no end of  sympathy. Go ahead, old fellow; I dare say I shall be taken bad some  day, and then I shall be able to make allowances for you.\"    \"I'll have nothing more to say to you, you young imp.\"    \"Don't say that, Harry,\" the lad said in a tone of alarm. \"You know how  sympathizing I am, and I know what a comfort it is for you to unburden  yourself; but I do think that it won't be necessary to go into personal  descriptions, you know, or to tell me what you said to her or she said  to you, because you told me all that ten days ago, also what her  tyrannical old father said. But really seriously I am awfully sorry  about it all, and if there is anything that I can possibly do for you I  shall be only too pleased. I don't see that it would be any advantage  for me to go and give the old gentleman my opinion of him; but if you  think it would, and can coach me in some of his sore points, we might  see how we could work upon them.\"    \"I always thought you were a young ass, Bertie,\" Harry said sternly,  \"but I have not realized before how utterly assified you are.\"    \"All right, Harry!\" the lad said cheerfully; \"hit me as hard as you  like, under the circumstances I feel that I cannot kick.\"    Harry said nothing for another five minutes.    \"This is a serious matter,\" he said at last, \"and I don't want any  tomfoolery.\"    \"All right, Harry! I will be as serious as a judge.\"    \"I am thinking of going away for two years.\"    The lad turned half round in his chair and had a good look at his  brother.    \"Where are you going to?\" seeing by Harry's rather gloomy face that he  was quite in earnest.    \"I believe I am going to Peru.\"    \"What are you going there for, Harry?\" the lad said quietly.    \"I told you,\" the other went on, \"that Mr. Fortescue said that he had  no personal objection to me, but that if I was in a position to give  his daughter a home equal to that which I wanted her to leave, he would  be content.\"    Bertie nodded.    \"This seemed to me hopeless,\" Harry went on. \"I told you that she was  willing to wait for two years, but that she couldn't promise much  longer than that, for her father had set his mind on her making a good  match; he has certainly put a tremendous pressure upon her. When I was  talking at the club this evening to Mr. Barnett--you know that he is  our oldest friend and is one of our trustees--I told him about it, and  said that though I was ready to do anything and go anywhere I could not  see my way at all to making a big fortune straight away. He agreed with  me. After talking it over he said he knew of but one way by which such  a thing would be at all possible, but the betting would be twenty  thousand to one against it. Of course I said that if there was even a  possibility I would try it. Well, you know he was in Peru for some  years. He says that the natives have all sorts of legends about rich  mines that were hidden when the Spaniards came first, and that it is  certain that, tremendous as was the amount of loot they got, a great  part of the Incas' treasure was hidden away. Once or twice there had  been great finds-in one case two million and a half dollars. It is  believed that the secret is still known to certain Indians. When he  went out there he had a muleteer,"]]]
