At the present  day no part of the vast continent is ruled by either Spain or Portugal,  but ten independent republics have their different flags and  governments.    Since its early discovery South America has been pre-eminently a  country of bloodshed. Revolution has succeeded revolution and hundreds  of thousands of the bravest have been slain, but, phoenix-like, the  country rises from its ashes.    Fifty millions of people now dwell beneath the Southern Cross and speak  the Portuguese and Spanish languages, and it is estimated that, with  the present rate of increase, 180 millions of people will speak these  languages by 1920.    South America is, pre-eminently, the coming continent. It is more  thinly settled than any other part of the world. At least six million  miles of its territory are suitable for immigrants--double the  available territory of the United States. \"No other tract of good land  exists that is so large and so unoccupied as South America.\" [Footnote:  Dr. Wood, Lima, Peru, in \"Protestant Missions in South America.\"] \"One  of the most marvellous of activities in the development of virgin lands  is in progress. It is greater than that of Siberia, of Australia, or  the Canadian North-West.\" [Footnote: The Outlook, March, 1908.]  Emigrants are pouring into the continent from crowded Europe, the old  order of things is quickly passing away, and docks and railroads are  being built. Bolivia is spending more than fifty million dollars in new  work. Argentina and Chile are pushing lines in all directions. Brazil  is preparing to penetrate her vast jungles, and all this means enormous  expense, for the highest points and most difficult construction that  have ever been encountered are found in Peru, and between Chile and  Argentina there has been constructed the longest tunnel in the world.  [Footnote: One railway ascends to the height of 12,800 feet.]    Most important of all, the old medieval Romanism of the Dark Ages is  losing its grip upon the masses, and slowly, but surely, the leaven is  working which will, before another decade, bring South America to the  forefront of the nations.    The economic possibilities of South America cannot be overestimated. It  is a continent of vast and varied possibilities. There are still  districts as large as the German Empire entirely unexplored, and tribes  of Indians who do not yet know that America has been \"discovered.\"    This is a continent of spiritual need. The Roman Catholic Church has  been a miserable failure. \"Nearly 7,000,000 of people in South America  still adhere, more or less openly, to the fetishisms of their  ancestors, while perhaps double that number live altogether beyond the  reach of Christian influence, even if we take the word Christian in its  widest meaning.\" [Footnote: Report of Senor F. de Castello] The Rev. W.  B. Grubb, a missionary in Paraguay, says: \"The greatest unexplored  region at present known on earth is there. It contains, as far as we  know, 300 distinct Indian nations, speaking 300 distinct languages, and  numbering some millions, all in the darkest heathenism.\" H. W. Brown,  in \"Latin America,\" says, \"There is a pagan population of four to five  millions.\" Then, with respect to the Roman Catholic population, Rev. T.  B. Wood, LL.D., in \"Protestant Missions in South America,\" says, \"South  America is a pagan field, properly speaking. Its image-worship is  idolatry. Abominations are grosser and more universal than among Roman  Catholics in Europe and the United States, where Protestantism has  greatly modified Catholicism. But it is _worse_ off than any other  great _pagan_ field in that it is dominated by a single mighty  hierarchy--the mightiest known in history. For centuries priestcraft  has had everything its own way all over the continent, and is now at  last yielding to outside pressure, but with desperate resistance.\"    \"South America has been for nearly four hundred years part of the  parish of the Pope. In contrast with it the north of the New  World--Puritan, prosperous, powerful, progressive--presents probably  the most remarkable evidence earth affords of the blessings of  Protestantism, while the results of Roman Catholicism _left to itself_  are writ large in letters of gloom across the priest-ridden, lax and  superstitious South. Her cities, among the gayest and grossest in the  world, her ecclesiastics enormously wealthy and strenuously opposed to  progress and liberty, South America groans under the tyranny of a  priesthood which, in its highest forms, is unillumined by, and  incompetent to preach, the gospel of God's free gift; and in its lowest  is proverbially and habitually drunken, extortionate and ignorant. The  fires of her unspeakable Inquisition still burn in the hearts of her  ruling clerics, and although the spirit of the age has in our  nineteenth century transformed all her monarchies into free Republics,  religious intolerance all but universally prevails.\" [Footnote:  Guiness's \"Romanism and Reformation.\"]    Prelates and priests, monks and nuns exert an influence that is  all-pervading. William E. Curtis, United States Commissioner to South  America, wrote: \"One-fourth of all the property belongs to the bishop.  There is a Catholic church for every 150 inhabitants. Ten per cent. of  the population are priests, monks or nuns, and 272 out of the 365 days  of the year are observed as fast or feast days. The priests control the  government and rule the country as absolutely as if the Pope were its  king. As a result, 75 per cent. of the children born are illegitimate,  and the social and political condition presents a picture of the dark  ages.\" It is said that, in one town, every fourth person you meet is a  priest or a nun, or an ecclesiastic of some sort.    Yet, with all this to battle against, the Christian missionary is  making his influence felt.    _La Razon_, an important newspaper of Trujillo, in a recent issue says:  \"In homage to truth, we make known with pleasure that the ministers of  Protestantism have benefited this town more in one year than all the  priests and friars of the Papal sect have done in three centuries.\"    \"Last year,\" writes Mr. Milne, of the American Bible Society, \"one of  our colporteurs in Ayacucho had to make his escape by the roof of a  house where he was staying, from a mob of half-castes, led on by a  friar. Finding their prey had escaped, they took his clothes and  several boxes of Bibles to the plaza of the city and burnt them.\"    It was not such a going-back as the outside world thought, but, oh, it  was a deeply significant one, when recently the leading men of the  Republic of Guatemala met together and solemnly threw over the religion  of their fathers, which, during 400 years of practice, had failed to  uplift, and re-established the old paganism of cultured Rome. So  serious was this step that the _Palace of Minerva_, the goddess of  trade, is engraved on the latest issue of Guatemalan postage stamps.  Believing that the few Protestants in the Republic are responsible for  the reaction, the Archbishop of Guatemala has promised to grant one  hundred days' indulgence to those who will pray for the overthrow of  Protestantism in that country.    \"Romanism is not Christianity,\" so the few Christian workers are  fighting against tremendous odds. What shall the harvest be?          PART I.    THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC    The country to which the author first went as a self-supporting  missionary in the year 1889.         And Nature, the old nurse, took       The child upon her knee,       Saying, \"Here is a story book       Thy Father hath written for thee.\"         \"Come, wander with me,\" she said,       \"Into regions yet untrod,       And read what is still unread       In the manuscripts of God.\"         And he wandered away and away       With Nature, the dear old nurse,       Who sung to him night and day       The rhymes of the universe.              --_Longfellow._      THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC    The Argentine Republic has an area of one and a quarter million square  miles. It is 2,600 miles from north to south, and 500 miles at its  widest part. It is twelve times the size of Great Britain. Although the  population of the country is about seven millions, only one per cent,  of its cultivable area is now occupied, yet Argentina has an  incomparable climate.    It is essentially a cattle country. She is said to surpass any other  nation in her numbers of live stock. The Bovril Co. alone kills 100,000  a year. On its broad plains there are _estandas_, or cattle ranches, of  fifty and one hundred thousand acres in extent, and on these cattle,  horses and sheep are herded in millions. Argentina has over twenty-nine  million cattle, seventy-seven million sheep, seven and a half million  horses, five and a half million mules, a quarter-million of donkeys,  and nearly three million swine and three million goats. Four billion  dollars of British capital are invested in the country.    Argentina has sixteen thousand miles of railway. This has been  comparatively cheap to build. On the flat prairie lands the rails are  laid, and there is a length of one hundred and seventy-five miles  without a single curve.    Three hundred and fifty thousand square miles of this prairie is  specially adapted to the growing of grain. In 1908-9 the yield of wheat  was 4,920,000 tons. Argentina has exported over three million tons of  wheat, over three million tons of corn, and one million tons of  linseed, in one year, while \"her flour mills can turn out 700,000 tons  of flour a year.\" [Footnote: Hirst's Argentina, 1910.]    \"It is a delight often met with there to look on a field of twenty  square miles, with the golden ears standing even and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7506"],[0,"The Huge Hunter; Or, The Steam Man of the Prairies (#2)"],[1," 'Jis' what I wanted; shall I run it for you?'    'No, I see how it works; them 'ere thingumbobs and gimcracks do it  all.'    'Johnny, hyar, will tell yer 'bout it.'    The little humpback sprung nimbly down, and ran around the man,  explaining as well as he could in a few moments the manner of  controlling its movements. The Yankee felt some sensitiveness in being  instructed by such a tiny specimen, and springing into the wagon,  exclaimed:    'Git eout! tryin' to teach yer uncle! I knowed how the thing would  work before you were born!'    Perching himself on the top of the wood which was heaped up in the  wagon, the enthusiastic New Englander carefully looked over the  prairie to see that the way was clear, and was about to 'let on  steam,' when he turned toward the Irishman.    'Come, Mickey, git up here.'    'Arrah now, but I never learnt to ride the divil when I was home in  the ould country,' replied the Irishman, backing away.    But both Ethan and Baldy united in their persuasions, and finally  Mickey consented, although with great trepidation. He timidly climbed  upon the wagon and took his seat beside the Yankee, looking very much  as a man may be supposed to look who mounts the hearse to attend his  own funeral.    'When yer wants to start, jist pull that 'ere gimcrack!' said Baldy,  pointing to the crook in the rod upon which his hand rested.    'Git eout, naow! do you think you're goin' to teach me that has  teached school fur five year in Connecticut?'    There were some peculiarities about the steam man which made him a  rather unwieldy contrivance. He had a way of starting with a jerk,  unless great skill was used in letting on steam; and his stoppage was  equally sudden, from the same cause.    When the Irishman and Yankee had fairly ensconced themselves on their  perch, the latter looked carefully round to make sure that no one was  in the way, and then he tuned the valve, which let on a full head of  steam.    For a second the monster did not stir. The steam had not fairly taken  'hold' yet; then he raised one immense spiked foot and held it  suspended in air.    'That's a great contrivance, ain't it?' exclaimed Ethan,  contemptuously.    'Can't do nothin' more than lift his foot. Wait till you see more!  he's goin' to dance and skip like a lamb, or outrun any locomotive you  ever sot eyes on!'    'Bad luck to the loikes of yees, why d' yees go on?' exclaimed the  irate Irishman, as he leaned forward and addressed the obdurate  machine. 'Are yees tryin' to fool us, bad luck to yees?'    At this instant, the feet of the steam man began rising and falling  with lightning like rapidity, the wagon being jerked forward with such  sudden swiftness, that both Ethan and Mickey turned back summersets,  rolling heels over head off the vehicle to the ground, while the  monster went puffing over the prairie, and at a terrific rate. Baldy  was about to start in pursuit of it, when Johnny, the deformed boy,  restrained him.    'It won't run far; the steam is nearly out.'    'Be jibbers! but me head is caved in!' exclaimed the Irishman, rising  to his feet, rubbing his head, and looking at his hand to see whether  there was blood upon it.    'Jerusalem! I thought she had upset or busted her b'iler!' said the  Yankee, looking around him with a bewildered air.    The two spectators were laughing furiously, and they could scarcely  stand the trick which had been played upon them.    'Let your old machine go to blazes!' muttered Ethan. 'If it acts that  way, I don't want nothin' to do with it.'    In the mean time the steamer had gone rattling over the prairie, until  about a quarter of a mile distant, when it rapidly slackened, and as  quickly halted.    'What's the matter wid it now?' asked Mickey; 'has it got the cramps  and gi'n out?'    'The steam is used up!' replied the dwarf, as he hurried after it; 'we  can soon start it again!'    All four made all haste toward the stationary figure; but the light  frame and superior activity of little Johnny brought him to it  considerably in advance of the others. Emptying a lot of wood from the  wagon, he was busily engaged in throwing it into his stomach when the  other two came up. His eyes sparkled, as he said:    'Jump up there, and I'll give you all a ride!'    The three clambered up and took their seats with great care, Mickey  and Ethan especially clinging as if their life depended on it.    Johnny threw in the fuel until the black smoke poured in a stream from  the hat. Before leaving it, he opened two smaller doors, at the knees,  which allowed the superfluous cinders and ashes to fall out. The water  in the boiler was then examined, and found all right. Johnny mounted  in his place, and took charge.    'Now we are ready! hold fast!'    'Begorrah, if I goes I takes the wagon wid me,' replied Mickey, as he  closed his teeth and hung on like death.    The engineer managed the monster with rare skill, letting on a full  head of steam, and just as it made a move shutting it off, and letting  it on almost immediately, and then shutting off and admitting it  again, until it began moving at a moderate pace, which, however,  rapidly increased until it was going fully thirty miles an hour.    Nothing could be more pleasant than this ride of a mile over the  prairie. The plain was quite level, and despite the extraordinary  speed attained, the wagon glided almost as smoothly as if running upon  a railroad. Although the air was still, the velocity created a stiff  breeze about the ears of the four seated on the top of the wood.    The hight of the steam man's head carried the smoke and cinders clear  of those behind, while the wonderful machinery within, worked with a  marvelous exactness, such as was a source of continued amazement to  all except the little fellow who had himself constructed the  extraordinary mechanism. The click of the joints as they obeyed their  motive power was scarcely audible, and, when once started, there was  no unevenness at all in its progress.    When the party had ridden about a half-mile, Johnny described a large  circle, and finally came back to the starting, checking the progress  with the same skill that he had started it. He immediately sprung  down, examined the fire, and several points of the man, when finding  everything right, he opened his knee-caps and let cinders and ashes  drop out.    'How kin yeou dew that?' inquired Ethan Hopkins, peering over his  shoulder.    'What's to hinder?'    'How kin he work his legs, if they're holler that way and let the fire  down 'em?'    'They ain't hollow. Don't you see they are very large, and there is  plenty of room for the leg-rods, besides leaving a place for the draft  and ashes?'    'Wal, I swan, if that ain't rather queer. And you made it all out of  your head naow?' asked the Yankee, looking at the diminutive inventor  before him.    'No, I had to use a good deal of iron,' was the reply of the  youngster, with a quizzical smile.    'You mean you got up the thing yourself?' 'Yes, sir,' was the quiet  but proud reply of the boy.    'Jingo and Jerusalem! but your daddy must be fond of you!' exclaimed  the enthusiastic New Englander, scanning him admiringly from head to  foot.    'I haven't any father.'    'Your mother then.'    'I don't know about that.'    'Say, you, can't yer tell a feller 'bout it?'    'Not now; I haven't time.'    As the steam horse was to rest for the present, he was 'put up.' The  engineer opened several cavities in his legs and breast, and different  parts of his body, and examined the machinery, carefully oiling the  various portions, and when he had completed, he drew a large oil skin  from the wagon, which, being spread out, covered both it and the steam  man himself.                                CHAPTER III. A GENIUS.    HAVING PROGRESSED thus far in our story, or properly having began in  the middle, it is now necessary that we should turn back to the proper  starting point.    Several years since a widow woman resided in the outskirts of St.  Louis, whose name was Brainerd. Her husband had been a mechanic, noted  for his ingenuity, but was killed some five years before by the  explosion of a steam boiler. He left behind him a son, hump-backed,  dwarfed, but with an amiable disposition that made him a favorite with  all with whom he came in contact.    If nature afflicts in one direction she frequently makes amends in  another direction, and this dwarf, small and misshapen as he was, was  gifted with a most wonderful mind. His mechanical ingenuity bordered  on the marvelous. When he went to school, he was a general favorite  with teachers and pupils. The former loved him for his sweetness of  disposition, and his remarkable proficiency in all studies, while the  latter based their affection chiefly upon the fact that he never  refused to assist any of them at their tasks, while with the  pocket-knife which he carried he constructed toys which were their  delight. Some of these were so curious and amusing that, had they  been securer by letters patent, they would have brought a competency  to him and his widowed mother.    But Johnny never thought of patenting them, although the principal  support of himself and mother came from one or two patents, which his  father had secured upon inventions, not near the equal of his.    There seemed no limit to his inventive powers. He made a locomotive  and then a steamboat, perfect in every part, even to the minutest,  using nothing but his knife, hammer, and a small chisel. He  constructed a clock with his jack-knife, which kept perfect time, and  the articles which he made were wonderfully stared at at fairs, and in  show windows, while Johnny modestly pegged away at some new idea. He  became a master of the art of telegraphy without assistance from any  one using merely a common school philosophy with which to acquire the  alphabet. He then made a couple of batteries, ran a line from his  window to a"]]]
