A belief was current in Mr. Browning's lifetime that he had Jewish blood  in his veins. It received outward support from certain accidents of his  life, from his known interest in the Hebrew language and literature,  from his friendship for various members of the Jewish community in  London. It might well have yielded to the fact of his never claiming the  kinship, which could not have existed without his knowledge, and which,  if he had known it, he would, by reason of these very sympathies, have  been the last person to disavow. The results of more recent and more  systematic inquiry have shown the belief to be unfounded.    Our poet sprang, on the father's side, from an obscure or, as family  tradition asserts, a decayed branch, of an Anglo-Saxon stock settled,  at an early period of our history, in the south, and probably also  south-west, of England. A line of Brownings owned the manors of  Melbury-Sampford and Melbury-Osmond, in north-west Dorsetshire; their  last representative disappeared--or was believed to do so--in the time  of Henry VII., their manors passing into the hands of the Earls of  Ilchester, who still hold them.* The name occurs after 1542 in different  parts of the country: in two cases with the affix of 'esquire', in two  also, though not in both coincidently, within twenty miles of Pentridge,  where the first distinct traces of the poet's family appear. Its cradle,  as he called it, was Woodyates, in the parish of Pentridge, on the  Wiltshire confines of Dorsetshire; and there his ancestors, of the third  and fourth generations, held, as we understand, a modest but independent  social position.         * I am indebted for these facts, as well as for some others       referring to, or supplied by, Mr. Browning's uncles,       to some notes made for the Browning Society by Dr. Furnivall.    This fragment of history, if we may so call it, accords better with our  impression of Mr. Browning's genius than could any pedigree which more  palpably connected him with the 'knightly' and 'squirely' families whose  name he bore. It supplies the strong roots of English national life  to which we instinctively refer it. Both the vivid originality of that  genius and its healthy assimilative power stamp it as, in some sense,  the product of virgin soil; and although the varied elements which  entered into its growth were racial as well as cultural, and inherited  as well as absorbed, the evidence of its strong natural or physical  basis remains undisturbed.    Mr. Browning, for his own part, maintained a neutral attitude in the  matter. He neither claimed nor disclaimed the more remote genealogical  past which had presented itself as a certainty to some older members of  his family. He preserved the old framed coat-of-arms handed down to him  from his grandfather; and used, without misgiving as to his right to do  so, a signet-ring engraved from it, the gift of a favourite uncle, in  years gone by. But, so long as he was young, he had no reason to think  about his ancestors; and, when he was old, he had no reason to care  about them; he knew himself to be, in every possible case, the most  important fact in his family history.         Roi ne suis, ni Prince aussi,       Suis le seigneur de Conti,    he wrote, a few years back, to a friend who had incidentally questioned  him about it.    Our immediate knowledge of the family begins with Mr. Browning's  grandfather, also a Robert Browning, who obtained through Lord  Shaftesbury's influence a clerkship in the Bank of England, and entered  on it when barely twenty, in 1769. He served fifty years, and rose to  the position of Principal of the Bank Stock Office, then an important  one, and which brought him into contact with the leading financiers  of the day. He became also a lieutenant in the Honourable Artillery  Company, and took part in the defence of the Bank in the Gordon Riots  of 1789. He was an able, energetic, and worldly man: an Englishman, very  much of the provincial type; his literary tastes being limited to the  Bible and 'Tom Jones', both of which he is said to have read through  once a year. He possessed a handsome person and, probably, a vigorous  constitution, since he lived to the age of eighty-four, though  frequently tormented by gout; a circumstance which may help to account  for his not having seen much of his grandchildren, the poet and his  sister; we are indeed told that he particularly dreaded the lively boy's  vicinity to his afflicted foot. He married, in 1778, Margaret, daughter  of a Mr. Tittle by his marriage with Miss Seymour; and who was born  in the West Indies and had inherited property there. They had three  children: Robert, the poet's father; a daughter, who lived an uneventful  life and plays no part in the family history; and another son who died  an infant. The Creole mother died also when her eldest boy was only  seven years old, and passed out of his memory in all but an indistinct  impression of having seen her lying in her coffin. Five years later the  widower married a Miss Smith, who gave him a large family.    This second marriage of Mr. Browning's was a critical event in the life  of his eldest son; it gave him, to all appearance, two step-parents  instead of one. There could have been little sympathy between his father  and himself, for no two persons were ever more unlike, but there was yet  another cause for the systematic unkindness under which the lad grew  up. Mr. Browning fell, as a hard man easily does, greatly under the  influence of his second wife, and this influence was made by her  to subserve the interests of a more than natural jealousy of her  predecessor. An early instance of this was her banishing the dead lady's  portrait to a garret, on the plea that her husband did not need two  wives. The son could be no burden upon her because he had a little  income, derived from his mother's brother; but this, probably, only  heightened her ill-will towards him. When he was old enough to go to a  University, and very desirous of going--when, moreover, he offered to  do so at his own cost--she induced his father to forbid it, because,  she urged, they could not afford to send their other sons to college. An  earlier ambition of his had been to become an artist; but when he showed  his first completed picture to his father, the latter turned away and  refused to look at it. He gave himself the finishing stroke in the  parental eyes, by throwing up a lucrative employment which he had held  for a short time on his mother's West Indian property, in disgust at the  system of slave labour which was still in force there; and he paid for  this unpractical conduct as soon as he was of age, by the compulsory  reimbursement of all the expenses which his father, up to that date, had  incurred for him; and by the loss of his mother's fortune, which, at the  time of her marriage, had not been settled upon her. It was probably  in despair of doing anything better, that, soon after this, in his  twenty-second year, he also became a clerk in the Bank of England. He  married and settled in Camberwell, in 1811; his son and daughter were  born, respectively, in 1812 and 1814. He became a widower in 1849; and  when, four years later, he had completed his term of service at the  Bank, he went with his daughter to Paris, where they resided until his  death in 1866.    Dr. Furnivall has originated a theory, and maintains it as a conviction,  that Mr. Browning's grandmother was more than a Creole in the strict  sense of the term, that of a person born of white parents in the West  Indies, and that an unmistakable dash of dark blood passed from her to  her son and grandson. Such an occurrence was, on the face of it, not  impossible, and would be absolutely unimportant to my mind, and, I think  I may add, to that of Mr. Browning's sister and son. The poet and his  father were what we know them, and if negro blood had any part in their  composition, it was no worse for them, and so much the better for the  negro. But many persons among us are very averse to the idea of such  a cross; I believe its assertion, in the present case, to be entirely  mistaken; I prefer, therefore, touching on the facts alleged in favour  of it, to passing them over in a silence which might be taken to mean  indifference, but might also be interpreted into assent.    We are told that Mr. Browning was so dark in early life, that a nephew  who saw him in Paris, in 1837, mistook him for an Italian. He neither  had nor could have had a nephew; and he was not out of England at the  time specified. It is said that when Mr. Browning senior was residing on  his mother's sugar plantation at St. Kitt's, his appearance was held  to justify his being placed in church among the coloured members of the  congregation. We are assured in the strongest terms that the story has  no foundation, and this by a gentleman whose authority in all matters  concerning the Browning family Dr. Furnivall has otherwise accepted  as conclusive. If the anecdote were true it would be a singular  circumstance that Mr. Browning senior was always fond of drawing negro  heads, and thus obviously disclaimed any unpleasant association with  them.    I do not know the exact physical indications by which a dark strain is  perceived; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6574"],[0,"Watchers of the Sky (#2)"],[1,"orange orchards.                                  Up and up,  Along the thin white trail that wound and climbed  And zig-zagged through the grey-green mountain sage,  The car went crawling, till the shining plain  Below it, like an airman's map, unrolled.  Houses and orchards dwindled to white specks  In midget cubes and squares of tufted green.  Once, as we rounded one steep curve, that made  The head swim at the canyoned gulf below,  We saw through thirty miles of lucid air  Elvishly small, sharp as a crumpled petal  Blown from the stem, a yard away, a sail  Lazily drifting on the warm blue sea.  Up for nine miles along that spiral trail  Slowly we wound to reach the lucid height  Above the clouds, where that white dome of shell,  No wren's now, but an eagle's, took the flush  Of dying day. The sage-brush all died out,  And all the southern growths, and round us now,  Firs of the north, and strong, storm-rooted pines  Exhaled a keener fragrance; till, at last,  Reversing all the laws of lesser hills,  They towered like giants round us. Darkness fell  Before we reached the mountain's naked height.    Over us, like some great cathedral dome,  The observatory loomed against the sky;  And the dark mountain with its headlong gulfs  Had lost all memory of the world below;  For all those cloudless throngs of glittering stars  And all those glimmerings where the abyss of space  Is powdered with a milky dust, each grain  A burning sun, and every sun the lord  Of its own darkling planets,--all those lights  Met, in a darker deep, the lights of earth,  Lights on the sea, lights of invisible towns,  Trembling and indistinguishable from stars,  In those black gulfs around the mountain's feet.  Then, into the glimmering dome, with bated breath,  We entered, and, above us, in the gloom  Saw that majestic weapon of the light  Uptowering like the shaft of some huge gun  Through one arched rift of sky.                                  Dark at its base  With naked arms, the crew that all day long  Had sweated to make ready for this night  Waited their captain's word.                               The switchboard shone  With elfin lamps of white and red, and keys  Whence, at a finger's touch, that monstrous tube  Moved like a creature dowered with life and will,  To peer from deep to deep.                             Below it pulsed  The clock-machine that slowly, throb by throb,  Timed to the pace of the revolving earth,  Drove the titanic muzzle on and on,  Fixed to the chosen star that else would glide  Out of its field of vision.                              So, set free  Balanced against the wheel of time, it swung,  Or rested, while, to find new realms of sky  The dome that housed it, like a moon revolved,  So smoothly that the watchers hardly knew  They moved within; till, through the glimmering doors,  They saw the dark procession of the pines  Like Indian warriors, quietly stealing by.    Then, at a word, the mighty weapon dipped  Its muzzle and aimed at one small point of light  One seeming insignificant star.                                  The chief,  Mounting the ladder, while we held our breath,  Looked through the eye-piece.                                Then we heard him laugh  His thanks to God, and hide it in a jest.  \"A prominence on Jupiter!\"--                               They laughed,  \"What do you mean?\"--\"It's moving,\" cried the chief,  They laughed again, and watched his glimmering face  High overhead against that moving tower.  \"Come up and see, then!\"                           One by one they went,  And, though each laughed as he returned to earth,  Their souls were in their eyes.                                  Then I, too, looked,  And saw that insignificant spark of light  Touched with new meaning, beautifully reborn,  A swimming world, a perfect rounded pearl,  Poised in the violet sky; and, as I gazed,  I saw a miracle,--right on its upmost edge  A tiny mound of white that slowly rose,  Then, like an exquisite seed-pearl, swung quite clear  And swam in heaven above its parent world  To greet its three bright sister-moons.                                          A moon,  Of Jupiter, no more, but clearer far  Than mortal eyes had seen before from earth,  O, beautiful and clear beyond all dreams  Was that one silver phrase of the starry tune  Which Galileo's \"old discoverer\" first  Dimly revealed, dissolving into clouds  The imagined fabric of our universe.  _\"Jupiter stands in heaven and will stand  Though all the sycophants bark at him,\"_ he cried,  Hailing the truth before he, too, went down,  Whelmed in the cloudy wreckage of that dream.    So one by one we looked, the men who served  Urania, and the men from Vulcan's forge.  A beautiful eagerness in the darkness lit  The swarthy faces that too long had missed  A meaning in the dull mechanic maze  Of labour on this blind earth, but found it now.  Though only a moment's wandering melody  Hopelessly far above, it gave their toil  Its only consecration and its joy.  There, with dark-smouldering eyes and naked throats,  Blue-dungareed, red-shirted, grimed and smeared  With engine-grease and sweat, they gathered round  The foot of that dim ladder; each muttering low  As he came down, his wonder at what he saw  To those who waited,--a picture for the brush  Of Rembrandt, lighted only by the rift  Above them, where the giant muzzle thrust  Out through the dim arched roof, and slowly throbbed,  Against the slowly moving wheel of the earth,  Holding their chosen star.                             There, like an elf,  Perched on the side of that dark slanting tower  The Italian mechanician watched the moons,  That Italy discovered.                         One by one,  American, English, French, and Dutch, they climbed  To see the wonder that their own blind hands  Had helped to achieve.                         At midnight while they paused  To adjust the clock-machine, I wandered out  Alone, into the silence of the night.  The silence? On that lonely height I heard  Eternal voices;  For, as I looked into the gulf beneath,  Whence almost all the lights had vanished now,  The whole dark mountain seemed to have lost its earth  And to be sailing like a ship through heaven.  All round it surged the mighty sea-like sound  Of soughing pine-woods, one vast ebb and flow  Of absolute peace, aloof from all earth's pain,  So calm, so quiet, it seemed the cradle-song,  The deep soft breathing of the universe  Over its youngest child, the soul of man.  And, as I listened, that Aeolian voice  Became an invocation and a prayer:  O you, that on your loftier mountain dwell  And move like light in light among the thoughts  Of heaven, translating our mortality  Into immortal song, is there not one  Among you that can turn to music now  This long dark fight for truth? Not one to touch  With beauty this long battle for the light,  This little victory of the spirit of man  Doomed to defeat--for what was all we saw  To that which neither eyes nor soul could see?--  Doomed to defeat and yet unconquerable,  Climbing its nine miles nearer to the stars.  Wars we have sung. The blind, blood-boltered kings  Move with an epic music to their thrones.  Have you no song, then, of that nobler war?  Of those who strove for light, but could not dream  Even of this victory that they helped to win,  Silent discoverers, lonely pioneers,  Prisoners and exiles, martyrs of the truth  Who handed on the fire, from age to age;  Of those who, step by step, drove back the night  And struggled, year on year, for one more glimpse  Among the stars, of sovran law, their guide;  Of those who searching inward, saw the rocks  Dissolving into a new abyss, and saw  Those planetary systems far within,  Atoms, electrons, whirling on their way  To build and to unbuild our solid world;  Of those who conquered, inch by difficult inch,  The freedom of this realm of law for man;  Dreamers of dreams, the builders of our hope,  The healers and the binders up of wounds,  Who, while the dynasts drenched the world with blood,  Would in the still small circle of a lamp  Wrestle with death like Heracles of old  To save one stricken child.                              Is there no song  To touch this moving universe of law  With ultimate light, the glimmer of that great dawn  Which over our ruined altars yet shall break  In purer splendour, and restore mankind  From darker dreams than even Lucretius knew  To vision of that one Power which guides the world.  How should men find it? Only through those doors  Which, opening inward, in each separate soul  Give each man access to that Soul of all  Living within each life, not to be found  Or known, till, looking inward, each alone  Meets the unknowable and eternal God.    And there was one that moved like light in light  Before me there,--Love, human and divine,  That can exalt all weakness into power,--  Whispering, _Take this deathless torch of song_...  Whispering, but with such faith, that even I  Was humbled into thinking this might be  Through love, though all the wisdom of the world  Account it folly.                    Let my breast be bared  To every shaft, then, so that Love be still  My one celestial guide the while I sing  Of those who caught the pure Promethean fire  One from another, each crying as he went down  To one that waited, crowned with youth and joy,--  _Take thou the splendour, carry it out of sight  Into the great new age I must not know,  Into the great new realm I must not tread_.          I    COPERNICUS      The neighbours gossiped idly at the door.  Copernicus lay dying overhead.  His little throng of friends, with startled eyes,  Whispered together, in that dark house of dreams,  From which by one dim crevice in the wall  He used to watch the stars.                              \"His book has come  From Nuremberg at last; but who would dare  To let him see it now?\"--                            \"They have altered it!
