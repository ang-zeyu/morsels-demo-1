A dying dog, a  dog of the cart--why should he waste hours over its agonies at peril of  losing a handful of copper coins, at peril of a shout of laughter?    Patrasche lay there, flung in the grass-green ditch. It was a busy road  that day, and hundreds of people, on foot and on mules, in wagons or in  carts, went by, tramping quickly and joyously on to Louvain. Some saw  him, most did not even look: all passed on. A dead dog more or less--it  was nothing in Brabant: it would be nothing anywhere in the world.    [Illustration]    After a time, among the holiday-makers, there came a little old man who  was bent and lame, and very feeble. He was in no guise for feasting: he  was very poorly and miserably clad, and he dragged his silent way slowly  through the dust among the pleasure-seekers. He looked at Patrasche,  paused, wondered, turned aside, then kneeled down in the rank grass and  weeds of the ditch, and surveyed the dog with kindly eyes of pity. There  was with him a little rosy, fair-haired, dark-eyed child of a few years  old, who pattered in amidst the bushes, for him breast-high, and stood  gazing with a pretty seriousness upon the poor, great, quiet beast.    Thus it was that these two first met--the little Nello and the big  Patrasche.    The upshot of that day was, that old Jehan Daas, with much laborious  effort, drew the sufferer homeward to his own little hut, which was a  stone's throw off amidst the fields, and there tended him with so much  care that the sickness, which had been a brain seizure, brought on by  heat and thirst and exhaustion, with time and shade and rest passed  away, and health and strength returned, and Patrasche staggered up again  upon his four stout, tawny legs.    Now for many weeks he had been useless, powerless, sore, near to death;  but all this time he had heard no rough word, had felt no harsh touch,  but only the pitying murmurs of the child's voice and the soothing  caress of the old man's hand.    In his sickness they too had grown to care for him, this lonely man and  the little happy child. He had a corner of the hut, with a heap of  dry grass for his bed; and they had learned to listen eagerly for his  breathing in the dark night, to tell them that he lived; and when he  first was well enough to essay a loud, hollow, broken bay, they laughed  aloud, and almost wept together for joy at such a sign of his sure  restoration; and little Nello, in delighted glee, hung round his rugged  neck with chains of marguerites, and kissed him with fresh and ruddy  lips.    So then, when Patrasche arose, himself again, strong, big, gaunt,  powerful, his great wistful eyes had a gentle astonishment in them that  there were no curses to rouse him and no blows to drive him; and  his heart awakened to a mighty love, which never wavered once in its  fidelity whilst life abode with him.    But Patrasche, being a dog, was grateful. Patrasche lay pondering long  with grave, tender, musing brown eyes, watching the movements of his  friends.    Now, the old soldier, Jehan Daas, could do nothing for his living but  limp about a little with a small cart, with which he carried daily the  milk-cans of those happier neighbors who owned cattle away into the  town of Antwerp. The villagers gave him the employment a little out of  charity--more because it suited them well to send their milk into the  town by so honest a carrier, and bide at home themselves to look after  their gardens, their cows, their poultry, or their little fields. But it  was becoming hard work for the old man. He was eighty-three, and Antwerp  was a good league off, or more.    Patrasche watched the milk-cans come and go that one day when he had got  well and was lying in the sun with the wreath of marguerites round his  tawny neck.    The next morning, Patrasche, before the old man had touched the cart,  arose and walked to it and placed himself betwixt its handles, and  testified as plainly as dumb show could do his desire and his ability  to work in return for the bread of charity that he had eaten. Jehan Daas  resisted long, for the old man was one of those who thought it a foul  shame to bind dogs to labor for which Nature never formed them. But  Patrasche would not be gainsaid: finding they did not harness him, he  tried to draw the cart onward with his teeth.    At length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished by the persistence and the  gratitude of this creature whom he had succored. He fashioned his cart  so that Patrasche could run in it, and this he did every morning of his  life thenceforward.    When the winter came, Jehan Daas thanked the blessed fortune that had  brought him to the dying dog in the ditch that fair-day of Louvain; for  he was very old, and he grew feebler with each year, and he would ill  have known how to pull his load of milk-cans over the snows and through  the deep ruts in the mud if it had not been for the strength and the  industry of the animal he had befriended. As for Patrasche, it seemed  heaven to him. After the frightful burdens that his old master had  compelled him to strain under, at the call of the whip at every step, it  seemed nothing to him but amusement to step out with this little light  green cart, with its bright brass cans, by the side of the gentle old  man who always paid him with a tender caress and with a kindly word.  Besides, his work was over by three or four in the day, and after that  time he was free to do as he would--to stretch himself, to sleep in the  sun, to wander in the fields, to romp with the young child, or to play  with his fellow-dogs. Patrasche was very happy.    Fortunately for his peace, his former owner was killed in a drunken  brawl at the Kermesse of Mechlin, and so sought not after him nor  disturbed him in his new and well-loved home.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    A few years later, old Jehan Daas, who had always been a cripple, became  so paralyzed with rheumatism that it was impossible for him to go out  with the cart any more. Then little Nello, being now grown to his sixth  year of age, and knowing the town well from having accompanied his  grandfather so many times, took his place beside the cart, and sold the  milk and received the coins in exchange, and brought them back to their  respective owners with a pretty grace and seriousness which charmed all  who beheld him.    The little Ardennois was a beautiful child, with dark, grave, tender  eyes, and a lovely bloom upon his face, and fair locks that clustered to  his throat; and many an artist sketched the group as it went by him--the  green cart with the brass flagons of Teniers and Mieris and Van Tal,  and the great tawny-colored, massive dog, with his belled harness that  chimed cheerily as he went, and the small figure that ran beside him  which had little white feet in great wooden shoes, and a soft, grave,  innocent, happy face like the little fair children of Rubens.    Nello and Patrasche did the work so well and so joyfully together that  Jehan Daas himself, when the summer came and he was better again, had no  need to stir out, but could sit in the doorway in the sun and see them  go forth through the garden wicket, and then doze and dream and pray  a little, and then awake again as the clock tolled three and watch for  their return. And on their return Patrasche would shake himself free of  his harness with a bay of glee, and Nello would recount with pride the  doings of the day; and they would all go in together to their meal of  rye bread and milk or soup, and would see the shadows lengthen over the  great plain, and see the twilight veil the fair cathedral spire; and  then lie down together to sleep peacefully while the old man said a  prayer. So the days and the years went on, and the lives of Nello and  Patrasche were happy, innocent, and healthful. In the spring and summer  especially were they glad. Flanders is not a lovely land, and around  the burgh of Rubens it is perhaps least lovely of all. Corn and colza,  pasture and plough, succeed each other on the characterless plain in  wearying repetition, and save by some gaunt gray tower, with its peal  of pathetic bells, or some figure coming athwart the fields, made  picturesque by a gleaner's bundle or a woodman's fagot, there is no  change, no variety, no beauty anywhere; and he who has dwelt upon the  mountains or amidst the forests feels oppressed as by imprisonment with  the tedium and the endlessness of that vast and dreary level. But it  is green and very fertile, and it has wide horizons that have a certain  charm of their own even in their dulness and monotony; and among the  rushes by the water-side the flowers grow, and the trees rise tall and  fresh where the barges glide with their great hulks black against the  sun, and their little green barrels and vari-colored flags gay against  the leaves. Anyway, there is greenery and breadth of space enough to be  as good as beauty to a child and a dog; and these two asked no better,  when their work was done, than to lie buried in the lush grasses on the  side of the canal, and watch the cumbrous vessels drifting by and bring  the crisp salt smell of the sea among the blossoming scents of the  country summer.    True, in the winter it was harder, and they had to rise in the darkness  and the bitter cold, and they had seldom as much as they could have  eaten any day, and the hut was scarce better than a shed when the nights  were cold, although it looked so pretty in warm weather, buried in a  great kindly clambering vine, that never bore fruit, indeed, but which  covered it with luxuriant green tracery all through the months of  blossom and harvest. In winter the winds found many holes in the walls  of the poor little hut, and the vine was black and leafless, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#2)"],[1,"Cook during the Period between his first  and second Voyage    CHAP.

CHAPTER I.    Account of Captain Cook, previous to his first Voyage round the World.      Captain James Cook had no claim to distinction on account of the  lustre of his birth, or the dignity of his ancestors. His father,  James Cook, who from his dialect is supposed to have been a  Northumbrian, was in the humble station of a servant in husbandry, and  married a woman of the same rank with himself, whose Christian name  was Grace. Both of them were noted in their neighbourhood for their  honesty, sobriety, and diligence. They first lived at a village called  Morton, and then removed to Marton, another village in the  North-riding of Yorkshire, situated in the high road from Gisborough,  in Cleveland, to Stockton upon Tees, in the county of Durham, at the  distance of six miles from each of these towns. At Morton, Captain  Cook was born, on the 27th of October, 1728;[1] and, agreeably to the  custom of the vicar of the parish, whose practice it was to baptize  infants soon after their birth, he was baptized on the 3rd of November  following. He was one of nine children, all of whom are now dead,  excepting a daughter, who married a fisherman at Redcar. The first  rudiments of young Cook's education were received by him at Marton,  where he was taught to read by dame Walker, the schoolmistress of the  village. When he was eight years of age, his father, in consequence of  the character he had obtained for industry, frugality, and skill in  husbandry, had a little promotion bestowed upon him, which was that of  being appointed head-servant, or hind,[2] to a farm belonging to the  late Thomas Skottow, Esq. called Airy Holme, near Great Ayton. To this  place, therefore, he removed with his family;[3] and his son James, at  Mr. Skottow's expense, was put to a day-school in Ayton, where he was  instructed in writing, and in a few of the first rules of arithmetic.      [Footnote 1: The mud house in which Captain Cook drew his first    breath is pulled down, and no vestiges of it are now remaining.]      [Footnote 2: This is the name which, in that part of the country,    is given to the head-servant, or bailiff, of a farm.]      [Footnote 3: Mr. Cook, senior, spent the close of his life with    his daughter, at Redcar, and is supposed to have been about    eighty-five years of age when he died.]    Before he was thirteen years of age, he was bound an apprentice to Mr.  William Sanderson, a haberdasher, or shopkeeper, at Straiths, a  considerable fishing town, about ten miles north of Whitby. This  employment, however, was very unsuitable to young Cook's disposition.  The sea was the object of his inclination; and his passion for it  could not avoid being strengthened by the situation of the town in  which he was placed, and the manner of life of the persons with whom  he must frequently converse. Some disagreement having happened between  him and his master, he obtained his discharge, and soon after bound  himself for seven years to Messrs. John and Henry Walker, of Whitby,  Quakers by religious profession, and principal owners of the ship  Freelove, and of another vessel, both of which were constantly  employed in the coal trade. The greatest part of his apprenticeship  was spent on board the Freelove. After he was out of his time, he  continued to serve in the coal and other branches of trade (though  chiefly in the former) in the capacity of a common sailor; till, at  length, he was raised to be mate of one of Mr. John Walker's ships.  During this period it is not recollected that he exhibited anything  very peculiar, either in his abilities or his conduct; though there  can be no doubt but that he had gained a considerable degree of  knowledge in the practical part of navigation, and that his attentive  and sagacious mind was laying up a store of observations, which would  be useful to him in future life.    In the spring of the year 1755, when hostilities broke out between  England and France, and there was a hot press for seamen, Mr. Cook  happened to be in the river Thames with the ship to which he belonged.  At first he concealed himself, to avoid being pressed; but reflecting,  that it might be difficult, notwithstanding all his vigilance, to  elude discovery or escape pursuit, he determined, upon farther  consideration, to enter voluntarily into his majesty's service, and to  take his future fortune in the royal navy. Perhaps he had some presage  in his own mind, that by his activity and exertions he might rise  considerably above his present situation. Accordingly, he went to a  rendezvous at Wapping, and entered with an officer of the Eagle man of  war, a ship of sixty guns, at that time commanded by Captain Hamer. To  this ship Captain (afterward Sir Hugh) Palliser was appointed, in the  month of October, 1755; and when he took the command, found in her  James Cook, whom he soon distinguished to be an able, active, and  diligent seaman. All the officers spoke highly in his favour, and the  Captain was so well pleased with his behaviour, that he gave him every  encouragement which lay in his power.    In the course of some time, Captain Palliser received a letter from  Mr. Osbaldeston, then member of Parliament for Scarborough,  acquainting him that several neighbours of his had solicited him to  write in favour of one Cook, on board the captain's ship. They had  heard that Captain Palliser had taken notice of him, and they  requested, if he thought Cook deserving of it, that he would point out  in what manner Mr. Osbaldeston might best contribute his assistance  towards forwarding the young man's promotion. The captain, in his  reply, did justice to Cook's merit; but, as he had been only a short  time in the navy, informed Mr. Osbaldeston that he could not be  promoted as a commission officer. A master's warrant, Captain Palliser  added, might perhaps be procured for Mr. Cook, by which he would be  raised to a station that he was well qualified to discharge with  ability and credit.    Such a warrant he obtained on the 10th of May, 1759, for the Grampus  sloop; but the proper master having unexpectedly returned to her, the  appointment did not take place. Four days after he was made master of  the Garland; when, upon inquiry, it was found, that he could not join  her, as the ship had already sailed. On the next day, the 15th of May,  he was appointed to the Mercury. These quick and successive  appointments shew that his interest was strong, and that the intention  to serve him was real and effectual.    The destination of the Mercury was to North America, where she joined  the fleet under the command of Sir Charles Saunders, which, in  conjunction with the land forces under General Wolfe, was engaged in  the famous siege of Quebec. During that siege, a difficult and  dangerous service was necessary to be performed. This was to take the  soundings in the channel of the river St. Lawrence, between the island  of Orleans and the north shore, directly in the front of the French  fortified camp at Montmorency and Beauport, in order to enable the  admiral to place ships against the enemy's batteries, and to cover our  army on a general attack, which the heroic Wolfe intended to make on  the camp. Captain Palliser, in consequence of his acquaintance with  Mr. Cook's sagacity and resolution, recommended him to the service;  and he performed it in the most complete manner. In this business he  was employed during the night-time, for several nights together. At  length he was discovered by the enemy, who collected a great number of  Indians and canoes, in a wood near the waterside, which were launched  in the night, for the purpose of surrounding him, and cutting him off.  On this occasion, he had a very narrow escape. He was obliged to run  for it, and pushed on shore on the island of Orleans, near the guard  of the English hospital. Some of the Indians entered at the stern of  the boat, as Mr. Cook leaped out at the bow; and the boat, which was a  barge belonging to one of the ships of war, was carried away in  triumph. However, he furnished the admiral with as correct and  complete a draught of the channel and soundings as could have been  made after our countrymen were in possession of Quebec. Sir Hugh  Palliser had good reason to believe, that before this time Mr. Cook  had scarcely ever used a pencil, and that he knew nothing of drawing.  But such was his capacity, that he speedily made himself master of  every object to which he applied his attention.    Another important service was performed by Mr. Cook while the fleet  continued in the river of St. Lawrence. The navigation of that river  is exceedingly difficult and hazardous. It was particularly so to the  English, who were then in a great measure strangers to this part of  North America, and who had no chart, on the correctness of which they  could depend. It was therefore ordered by the admiral, that Mr. Cook  should be employed to survey those parts of the river, below Quebec,  which navigators had experienced to be attended with peculiar  difficulty and danger; and he executed the business with the same  diligence and skill of which he had already afforded so happy a  specimen. When he had finished the undertaking, his chart of the river  St. Lawrence was published, with soundings, and directions for sailing  in that river. Of the accuracy and utility of"]]]
