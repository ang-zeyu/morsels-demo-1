[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#2)"],[1,"it occurred to me suddenly  that I would visit Ruritania. It may seem strange that I had never  visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness  for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his second son, the famous  Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and,  since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family  tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that  country. But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up  with a curiosity to see it. After all, red hair and long noses are  not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed  a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from  acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which  had played no small part in European history, and might do the like  again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new  King was rumoured to be. My determination was clinched by reading in _The  Times_ that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course  of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark  the occasion. At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my  preparations. But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish  my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I  anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a  ramble in the Tyrol--an old haunt of mine--and propitiated Rose's wrath  by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems  of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood.    \"Perhaps,\" I hinted darkly, \"there may be an outcome of the expedition.\"    \"What do you mean?\" she asked.    \"Well,\" said I carelessly, \"there seems a gap that might be filled by an  exhaustive work on--\"    \"Oh! will you write a book?\" she cried, clapping her hands. \"That would  be splendid, wouldn't it, Robert?\"    \"It's the best of introductions to political life nowadays,\" observed my  brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several  times over. _Burlesdon on Ancient Theories and Modern Facts_ and _The  Ultimate Outcome, by a Political Student_, are both works of recognized  eminence.    \"I believe you are right, Bob, my boy,\" said I.    \"Now promise you'll do it,\" said Rose earnestly.    \"No, I won't promise; but if I find enough material, I will.\"    \"That's fair enough,\" said Robert.    \"Oh, material doesn't matter!\" she said, pouting.    But this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me.  To tell the truth, I would have wagered a handsome sum that the story  of my expedition that summer would stain no paper and spoil not a single  pen. And that shows how little we know what the future holds; for here I  am, fulfilling my qualified promise, and writing, as I never thought  to write, a book--though it will hardly serve as an introduction to  political life, and has not a jot to do with the Tyrol.    Neither would it, I fear, please Lady Burlesdon, if I were to submit it  to her critical eye--a step which I have no intention of taking.          CHAPTER 2    Concerning the Colour of Men's Hair      It was a maxim of my Uncle William's that no man should pass through  Paris without spending four-and-twenty hours there. My uncle spoke out  of a ripe experience of the world, and I honoured his advice by putting  up for a day and a night at \"The Continental\" on my way to--the Tyrol.  I called on George Featherly at the Embassy, and we had a bit of dinner  together at Durand's, and afterwards dropped in to the Opera; and  after that we had a little supper, and after that we called on Bertram  Bertrand, a versifier of some repute and Paris correspondent to _The  Critic_. He had a very comfortable suite of rooms, and we found some  pleasant fellows smoking and talking. It struck me, however, that  Bertram himself was absent and in low spirits, and when everybody except  ourselves had gone, I rallied him on his moping preoccupation. He  fenced with me for a while, but at last, flinging himself on a sofa, he  exclaimed:    \"Very well; have it your own way. I am in love--infernally in love!\"    \"Oh, you'll write the better poetry,\" said I, by way of consolation.    He ruffled his hair with his hand and smoked furiously. George  Featherly, standing with his back to the mantelpiece, smiled unkindly.    \"If it's the old affair,\" said he, \"you may as well throw it up, Bert.  She's leaving Paris tomorrow.\"    \"I know that,\" snapped Bertram.    \"Not that it would make any difference if she stayed,\" pursued the  relentless George. \"She flies higher than the paper trade, my boy!\"    \"Hang her!\" said Bertram.    \"It would make it more interesting for me,\" I ventured to observe, \"if I  knew who you were talking about.\"    \"Antoinette Mauban,\" said George.    \"De Mauban,\" growled Bertram.    \"Oho!\" said I, passing by the question of the `de'. \"You don't mean to  say, Bert--?\"    \"Can't you let me alone?\"    \"Where's she going to?\" I asked, for the lady was something of a  celebrity.    George jingled his money, smiled cruelly at poor Bertram, and answered  pleasantly:    \"Nobody knows. By the way, Bert, I met a great man at her house the  other night--at least, about a month ago. Did you ever meet him--the  Duke of Strelsau?\"    \"Yes, I did,\" growled Bertram.    \"An extremely accomplished man, I thought him.\"    It was not hard to see that George's references to the duke were  intended to aggravate poor Bertram's sufferings, so that I drew the  inference that the duke had distinguished Madame de Mauban by his  attentions. She was a widow, rich, handsome, and, according to repute,  ambitious. It was quite possible that she, as George put it, was flying  as high as a personage who was everything he could be, short of enjoying  strictly royal rank: for the duke was the son of the late King of  Ruritania by a second and morganatic marriage, and half-brother to the  new King. He had been his father's favourite, and it had occasioned  some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke, with a title  derived from no less a city than the capital itself. His mother had been  of good, but not exalted, birth.    \"He's not in Paris now, is he?\" I asked.    \"Oh no! He's gone back to be present at the King's coronation; a  ceremony which, I should say, he'll not enjoy much. But, Bert, old man,  don't despair! He won't marry the fair Antoinette--at least, not unless  another plan comes to nothing. Still perhaps she--\" He paused and added,  with a laugh: \"Royal attentions are hard to resist--you know that, don't  you, Rudolf?\"    \"Confound you!\" said I; and rising, I left the hapless Bertram in  George's hands and went home to bed.    The next day George Featherly went with me to the station, where I took  a ticket for Dresden.    \"Going to see the pictures?\" asked George, with a grin.    George is an inveterate gossip, and had I told him that I was off to  Ruritania, the news would have been in London in three days and in Park  Lane in a week. I was, therefore, about to return an evasive answer,  when he saved my conscience by leaving me suddenly and darting across  the platform. Following him with my eyes, I saw him lift his hat and  accost a graceful, fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared from  the booking-office. She was, perhaps, a year or two over thirty, tall,  dark, and of rather full figure. As George talked, I saw her glance at  me, and my vanity was hurt by the thought that, muffled in a fur coat  and a neck-wrapper (for it was a chilly April day) and wearing a soft  travelling hat pulled down to my ears, I must be looking very far from  my best. A moment later, George rejoined me.    \"You've got a charming travelling companion,\" he said. \"That's poor Bert  Bertrand's goddess, Antoinette de Mauban, and, like you, she's going to  Dresden--also, no doubt, to see the pictures. It's very queer, though,  that she doesn't at present desire the honour of your acquaintance.\"    \"I didn't ask to be introduced,\" I observed, a little annoyed.    \"Well, I offered to bring you to her; but she said, 'Another time.'  Never mind, old fellow, perhaps there'll be a smash, and you'll have a  chance of rescuing her and cutting out the Duke of Strelsau!\"    No smash, however, happened, either to me or to Madame de Mauban. I can  speak for her as confidently as for myself; for when, after a night's  rest in Dresden, I continued my journey, she got into the same train.  Understanding that she wished to be let alone, I avoided her carefully,  but I saw that she went the same way as I did to the very end of my  journey, and I took opportunities of having a good look at her, when I  could do so unobserved.    As soon as we reached the Ruritanian frontier (where the old officer who  presided over the Custom House favoured me with such a stare that I felt  surer than before of my Elphberg physiognomy), I bought the papers, and  found in them news which affected my movements. For some reason, which  was not clearly explained, and seemed to be something of a mystery, the  date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced, and the ceremony was  to take place on the next day but one. The whole country seemed in a  stir about it, and it was evident that Strelsau was thronged. Rooms were  all let and hotels overflowing; there would be very little chance of my  obtaining a lodging, and I should certainly have to pay an exorbitant  charge for it. I made up my mind to stop at Zenda, a small town fifty  miles short of the capital, and about ten from the frontier. My train  reached there in the evening; I would spend the next day, Tuesday, in a  wander over the hills, which were said to be very fine, and in taking  a glance at the famous Castle, and go over by train to Strelsau on the  Wednesday morning, returning at night to sleep at Zenda.    Accordingly at Zenda I got out, and as the train"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#2)"],[1,"one was being attacked by a number  of bad men, known as the \"Happy Harry Gang,\" who wished to obtain  possession of a valuable turbine patent model belonging to Mr. Swift.  Tom was taking it to a lawyer, when he was waylaid, and chloroformed.  Later he traced the gang, and, with the assistance of Mr. Damon and  Eradicate Sampson, an aged colored man who made a living for himself  and his mule, Boomerang, by doing odd jobs, the lad found the thieves  and recovered a motor-boat which had been stolen. But the men got away.    In the second volume, called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat,\" Tom bought  at auction the boat stolen by, and recovered from, the thieves, and  proceeded to improve it. While he was taking his father out on a cruise  for Mr. Swift's health, the Happy Harry Gang made a successful attempt  to steal some valuable inventions from the Swift house. Tom started to  trace them, and incidentally he raced and beat Andy Foger, a rich  bully. On their way down the lake, after the robbery, Tom, his father  and Ned Newton, Tom's chum, saw a man hanging from the trapeze of a  blazing balloon over Lake Carlopa. The balloonist was Mr. John Sharp  and he was rescued by Tom in a thrilling fashion. In his motor-boat,  Tom had much pleasure, not the least of which was taking out a young  lady named Miss Mary Nestor, whose acquaintance he had made after  stopping her runaway horse, which his bicycle had frightened.  Tom's  association with  Miss Nestor soon ripened into something deeper than  mere friendship.    It developed that Mr. Sharp, whom Tom had saved from the burning  balloon, was an aeronaut of note, and had once planned to build an  airship. After his recovery from his thrilling experience, he mentioned  the matter to Mr. Swift and his son, with whom he took up his  residence. This fitted right in with Tom's ideas, and soon father, son  and the balloonist were constructing the Red Cloud, as they named their  airship. It was finally completed, as related in \"Tom Swift and His  Airship,\" made a successful trial trip, and won a prize. It was planned  to make a longer journey, and Tom, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon agreed to go  together. Mr. Damon was an odd individual, who was continuously  blessing some part of his anatomy, his clothing or some inanimate  object but, for all that, he was a fine man.    The night before Tom and his friends started off in their airship, the  Shopton Bank vault was blown open and seventy-five thousand dollars was  taken. Tom and his friends did not know of this, but, no sooner had the  young inventor, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon sailed away, than the police  arrived at Mr. Swift's house to arrest them. They were charged with the  robbery, and with having sailed away with the booty.    It appeared that Andy Foger said he had seen Tom hanging around the  bank the night of the robbery, with a bag of burglar tools in his  possession. Search was immediately begun for the airship, the occupants  of which were, meanwhile, speeding on.    Tom and his two friends had trouble. They were nearly burned up in a  forest fire, and were fired upon by a crowd of people with rifles, who,  reading of the bank robbery and the reward offered for the capture of  the thieves, hoped to bring down the airship.  The fact that they were  fired upon caused Tom and the two aeronauts to descend to make an  investigation, and for the first time they learned of the bank theft.  How they got track of the real robbers, took the sheriff with them in  the airship, and raided the gang will be found set down at length in  the book.  Also how Tom administered well-deserved thrashing to Andy  Foger.    Mr. Swift did not accompany his son in the airship, and when asked why  he did not care to make the trip, said he was working on a new type of  submarine boat, which he hoped to enter in the government trials, to  win a prize. In the fourth volume of the series, called \"Tom Swift and  his Submarine,\" you may read how successful Mr. Swift was.    When the submarine, called the Advance, was finished, the party made a  trip to recover three hundred thousand dollars in gold from a sunken  treasure ship, off the coast of Uruguay, South America. They sailed  beneath the seas for many miles, and were in great peril at times. One  reason for this was that a rival firm of submarine builders got wind of  the treasure, and tried to get ahead of the Swifts in recovering it.  How Tom and his friends succeeded in their quest, how they nearly  perished at the bottom of the sea, how they were captured by a foreign  war vessel, and sentenced to death, how they fought with a school of  giant sharks and how they blew up the wreck to recover the money is all  told of in the book.    On their return to civilization with the gold, Mr. Swift, Tom, and  their friends deposited the money in the Shopton Bank, where Ned Newton  worked. Ned was a bright lad, but had not been advanced as rapidly as  he deserved, and Tom knew this. He asked his father to speak to the  president, Mr. Pendergast, in Ned's behalf, and, as a result the lad  was made assistant cashier, for the request of a man who controlled a  three hundred thousand dollar deposit was not to be despised.    In building the submarine Tom and his father rented a large cottage on  the New Jersey seacoast, but, on returning from their treasure-quest  they went back to Shopton, leaving the submarine at the boathouse of  the shore cottage, which was near the city of Atlantis. That was in the  fall of the year, and all that winter the young inventor had been busy  on many things, not the least of which was his storage battery. It was  now spring, and seeing the item in the paper, about the touring club  prize for an electric auto, had given him a new idea.    But all thoughts of electric cars, and everything else, were driven  from the mind of the young man, when, with his father, he rushed out to  see the cause of the crash on the roof of the Swift homestead.    \"There's something up there, Tom,\" called his father, as he splashed on  through the rain.    \"That's right,\" added his son. \"And somebody, too, to judge by the fuss  they're making.\"    \"Maybe the house has been struck by lightning!\" suggested the aged  inventor.    \"No, the storm isn't severe enough for that; and, besides, if the house  had been struck you'd hear Mrs. Baggert yelling, Dad.  She--\"    At that moment a woman's voice cried out:    \"Mr. Swift! Tom! Where are you? Something dreadful has happened!\"    \"There she goes!\" remarked Mr. Swift, as he splashed into a mud puddle.    \"Bless my deflection rudder!\" suddenly cried a voice from the flat roof  of the Swift house. \"Hello! I say, is anyone down there?\"    \"Yes, we are,\" answered Tom. \"Is that you, Mr. Damon?\"    \"Bless my collar button! It certainly is.\"    \"Where's Mr. Sharp? I don't hear him.\"    \"Oh, I'm here all right,\" answered the balloonist. \"I'm trying to get  the airship clear of the chimney. Mr. Damon--\"    \"Yes, I steered wrong!\" interrupted the odd man. \"Bless my liver pin,  but it was so dark I couldn't see, and when that clap of thunder came I  shifted the deflection rudder instead of the lateral one, and tried to  knock over your chimney.\"    \"Are either of you hurt?\" asked Mr. Swift anxiously.    \"No, not at all,\" replied Mr. Sharp. \"We were moving slowly, ready for  a landing.\"    \"Is the airship damaged?\" inquired Tom.    \"I don't know. Not much, I guess,\" was the answer of the aeronaut.  \"I've stopped the engine, and I don't like to start it again until I  can see what shape we're in.\"    \"I'll come up, with Mr. Jackson,\" called Tom, and he hastily summoned  Garret Jackson, an engineer, who had been in the service of Mr. Swift  for many years. Together they proceeded to the roof by a stairway that  led to a scuttle.    \"Is anyone killed?\" asked Mrs. Baggert, as Tom hurried up the stairs.  \"Don't tell me there is, Tom!\"    \"Well, I don't have to tell you, for no one is,\" replied the young  inventor with a laugh. \"It's all right. The airship tried to collide  with the chimney, that's all.\"    He was soon on the large, flat roof of the dwelling, and, with the aid  of lanterns he, the engineer, and Mr. Sharp made a hasty examination.    \"Anything wrong?\" inquired Mr. Damon, looking out from the cabin of the  Red Cloud where he had taken refuge after the crash, and to get out of  the wet.    \"Not much,\" answered Tom. \"One of the forward planes is smashed, but we  can rise by means of the gas, and float down. Is all clear, Mr. Sharp?\"    \"All clear,\" replied the balloonist, for the airship had now been  wheeled back from the entanglement with the chimney.    \"Then here we go!\" cried Tom, as he and the aeronaut entered the craft,  while Mr. Jackson descended through the scuttle.    There came a fiercer burst to the storm, and, amid a series of dazzling  lightning flashes and the muttering of thunder, the airship rose from  the roof. Tom switched on the search-light, and, starting the big  propellers, guided the craft skillfully toward the big shed where it  was housed when not in use.    With the grace of a bird it turned about in the air, and settled to the  ground. It was the work of but a few minutes to run it into the shed.  Then they all started for the house.    \"Bless my umbrella!  How it rains!\" cried Mr. Damon, as he splashed on  through numerous puddles. \"We got back just in time, Mr. Sharp.\"    \"Where did you go?\" asked the lad.    \"Why we took a flight of about fifty miles and stopped at my house in  Waterfield for supper. Were you anxious about us?\"    \"A little when it began to storm,\" replied Tom.    \"Anything new since we left?\" asked Mr. Sharp, for it was the custom of  himself, or some of his friends, to take little trips in the airship.  They thought no more of it than many do of going for a short spin in an  automobile.    \"Yes, there is something new,\" said Mr. Swift, as the party, all  drenched now, reached the broad veranda.    \"Bles"]]]
