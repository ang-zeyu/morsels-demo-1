[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#2)"],[1,"_Strange Orders_      Captain Standers, commander of the Harkness, was a true type of British  sea dog in both stature and looks. His legs were as sturdy and stubby  as fire hydrants. His body was like a barrel, and two muscle bulging  arms hung from a pair of shoulders as broad as the back of a taxi cab.  His face was lined and wrinkled from countless hours on the bridge  in fair weather and bad. And it was the color of well tanned saddle  leather, save a spot on each cheek that was apple red. The eyes were  small and set wide apart, but in their depths was a glint that gave you  the feeling the man could see right through six inch steel armor. All  in all, Captain Standers looked quite capable of leaping overboard and  shoving his cruiser back into deep water should it ever run aground.    He swept the two R.A.F. youths with his gimlet eyes as they entered  his quarters and saluted.    \"At ease, Gentlemen,\" he said in a voice that could double for a  foghorn. \"Be seated. It seems that news of your coming to Singapore has  traveled ahead of you. I have a wireless, here, from Air Vice Marshal  Bostworth, of Singapore Air Base. He has made a request regarding you  two.\"    \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, of Singapore Base!\" Dawson gasped as the  Cruiser's captain paused for breath. \"But there must be some mistake,  sir. I mean, we saw Air Vice Marshal Bostworth just before we left  England. It was he who okayed our request for transfer to duty with the  Far East Fleet Air Arm.\"    Captain Standers snorted softly and gave Dawson a look as though he  were some school kid who had fumbled his homework.    \"Quite, Flight Lieutenant,\" he said. \"But we've been at sea close to  three weeks. It's quite possible to _fly_ from London to Singapore, via  Egypt, in less than half that time.\"    \"Yes, sir, of course,\" Dave murmured as his face burned. \"I.... Well,  it sort of startled me, sir.\"    \"Quite so,\" the Harkness' commander grunted. \"That is neither here nor  there, however. The wireless is from Air Vice Marshal Bostworth, and  it was sent from R.A.F. Base at Singapore. The request is for you two  pilots to take one of the Harkness' planes aloft and cruise over the  Singapore Strait for two hours and then proceed to the R.A.F. Base on  the Island. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth will meet you there. You've got  that all clear?\"    Freddy and Dave looked at each other, and their thoughts were  identical. Was somebody trying to kid somebody, or something? Why in  the world were they to take one of the Harkness' Bristol powered Fairey  \"Swordfishes\" aloft and use up gas and oil for an hour or two? Why not  go right on into the Johore Strait Naval Anchorage aboard the Harkness,  and then step ashore to meet the Air Vice Marshal? It certainly didn't  make sense, and the bewildered look that spread over each youth's face  said as much to Captain Standers. He shrugged and made a little gesture  with his hand.    \"Don't bother asking me questions,\" he said. \"I haven't the faintest  idea what the answers should be. Sounds like so much R.A.F. rubbish,  I fancy. However, the request has the approval of the Base Admiral,  so there's only one thing I can do about it. Assign you to one of our  planes, and let you go your way.\"    \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up, his face slightly  crimson, \"but was that all to the message? Just that we go aloft and  spend two hours in the air before landing at Singapore R.A.F. Base?\"    \"That was all, definitely,\" the Cruiser's captain replied. \"As a matter  of fact, I didn't believe it myself and had the first message checked.  The repeat was the same, however. Also, both messages were in a new  emergency code. You say you saw Air Vice Marshal Bostworth just before  you left England?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" the boys replied in one voice.    \"I see,\" the senior officer murmured. Then flinging them a keen look,  \"He didn't mention anything about coming out to Singapore himself?  Didn't say he might have a job for you two to do out here? The three  of us know that Air Vice Marshal Bostworth is connected with Air  Intelligence. And, naturally, your service records are not exactly deep  dark secrets. You aren't, perhaps, as ignorant of what all this crazy  business means as you appear to be, eh?\"    The two R.A.F. pilots grinned, but they both shook their heads.    \"Sorry, sir, but it's as much of a mystery to us,\" Freddy Farmer spoke  for them. \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth didn't even give us an inkling  that he might be coming out here. It really is surprising news to us,  sir.\"    Captain Standers hesitated as though about to speak, then thought  better of it and pushed up onto his feet.    \"Well, one can't know about everything in this blasted war, I fancy,\"  he grunted. \"You two had better get on with it. Use the plane on  Catapult Number Three. I've already told the signal officer to make  ready. Good luck. And, by the way!\"    \"Yes, sir?\" the two pilots murmured as the Cruiser's commander paused  and scowled at his gnarled hands.    \"When you finally land at Singapore R.A.F. Base,\" he finally said,  \"please mention to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth that I'd jolly well like  to have the plane back before we put to sea again. Planes are hard  enough to get as it is. Well, luck to you anyway.\"    Some twenty minutes later Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer were seated in  a pontoon fitted, Bristol Pegasus engined Fairey \"Swordfish\" mounted  on the starboard launching arm of Number Three catapult. The engine  was ticking over and the Signal Officer standing on the flight bridge  was ready to \"shoot\" the plane off into the air as soon as Dave at the  controls gave him the signal.    Checking his engine instruments for the last time, the Yank R.A.F. ace  turned in the seat and looked back at his English pal.    \"All set for the mystery ride, Freddy?\" he called out.    Young Farmer made a face and nodded.    \"Let her go, Dave,\" he replied. \"But I certainly hope these two hours  whizz by, so's we can land at Singapore Base and find out what in the  world this all means!\"    \"You and me both!\" Dave grunted. \"I've been given a lot of screwy  orders in my time, but this one is certainly tops. Oh, well, we'll get  a nice look at this neck of the Far East, anyway. Okay! Hold your hat.  The balloon's going up!\"    Turning front, Dave nodded to the waiting signal officer, and  automatically braced his body and put his head firmly against the back  rest, so that it wouldn't be snapped back when the launching \"trigger\"  was pulled. A couple of seconds later the Swordfish's engine was  roaring out its mighty song of power and straining at the locking-dogs  that held it on the catapult arm. Another second and it was as though  an invisible giant had slammed the rear end of the plane with the side  of a barn door, or something. The Swordfish leaped forward like a  scared cat. It shot off the end of the catapult arm, sank toward the  water for a brief instant, then rose upward as the whirling prop bit  into the air and produced flying speed.    Once clear and curving upward, Dave throttled slightly and held the  nose on a gentle climb toward Heaven. He turned and grinned at Freddy  and then glanced down back at the Harkness cutting through the sun  flooded waters of the China Sea like a perfectly streamlined battle  grey fish. For a moment signal flags that spelled out G-O-O-D L-U-C-K  fluttered in the wind, then they were hauled down and the Harkness  began falling far astern of the climbing plane. Dave looked front  again, leveled off at a comfortable six thousand feet and relaxed  comfortably in the seat.    \"Ladies and Gentlemen!\" came Freddy Farmer's voice to his ears. \"On the  far left you have the British owned island of Singapore. Just above  it is the Malay Peninsula where they produce about eighty per cent of  all the rubber in the world. And tin, also. A bit more to the north is  French Indo-China. Far to the right are the Philippines. And way in  back of you are the Dutch East Indies, including Borneo and Sumatra. If  you smoke cigars, Ladies and Gentlemen, you should be doubly interested  in Sumatra because the famous Sumatra leaf used as an outside wrapper  for many, many brands of cigars comes from Sumatra. Personally, I'm not  very interested because I do not smoke cigars. However....\"    \"However, shut up, Professor!\" Dave interrupted with a laugh. \"We  can see it all, and we studied all about these parts when we were in  school. But ... there is one question I would like to ask the learned  Professor.\"    \"Certainly, my child, certainly,\" Freddy Farmer replied. \"Go right  ahead. What do you want to know?\"    \"Boy, are you sticking your chin out!\" Dave chuckled. \"Okay! Why _are_  we flying around up here, Professor?\"    \"Good Lord, I should have suspected that!\" Freddy Farmer groaned.  \"Well, it's a secret. A very deep dark secret. Only one man knows. And  so far he hasn't told anybody. He.... Hey, Dave!\"    \"Don't shout, I haven't jumped out, yet,\" Dave cried and turned quickly  around. \"What...?\"    Dave stopped short and stared hard at his pal. Freddy Farmer was  leaning way forward to the right and gaping puzzle eyed down at the  rolling surface of the China Sea far ahead. He didn't switch his gaze  to Dave's face. He simply made a little movement with one hand and kept  his eyes riveted on something ahead.    \"Take a look way out there, Dave!\" he shouted. \"I thought I saw some  flashes of light.\"    \"Light?\" Dawson echoed sharply. \"This time of day? Are you nuts, or  just seeing things?\"    \"I saw something!\" the English youth said. \"At least I'd be willing to  swear to it. Sort of flashes of light, as though some surface ship were  signaling by mirror. You know, by heliograph.\"    Dave didn't make any comment to that for a moment or two. He had turned  front and was sweeping the waters ahead and below with his eyes.  However, that was all he saw. Just a limitless expanse of robin's egg"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#2)"],[1," skirt was  some gaudy print goods, torn and stained and dusty. She had little feet,  incased in brown moccasins, fitting like gloves and buttoning over the  ankles with silver coins.    \"Who was that man? Did he hurt you?\" inquired Shefford, turning to gaze  down the valley where a moving black object showed on the bare sand.    \"No savvy,\" replied the Indian girl.    \"Where's the trader Presbrey?\" asked Shefford.    She pointed straight down into the red valley.    \"Toh,\" she said.    In the center of the basin lay a small pool of water shining brightly in  the sunset glow. Small objects moved around it, so small that Shefford  thought he saw several dogs led by a child. But it was the distance  that deceived him. There was a man down there watering his horses. That  reminded Shefford of the duty owing to his own tired and thirsty beast.  Whereupon he untied his pack, took off the saddle, and was about ready  to start down when the Indian girl grasped the bridle from his hand.    \"Me go,\" she said.    He saw her eyes then, and they made her look different. They were as  black as her hair. He was puzzled to decide whether or not he thought  her handsome.    \"Thanks, but I'll go,\" he replied, and, taking the bridle again, he  started down the slope. At every step he sank into the deep, soft sand.  Down a little way he came upon a pile of tin cans; they were everywhere,  buried, half buried, and lying loose; and these gave evidence of how  the trader lived. Presently Shefford discovered that the Indian girl  was following him with her own pony. Looking upward at her against the  light, he thought her slender, lithe, picturesque. At a distance he  liked her.    He plodded on, at length glad to get out of the drifts of sand to the  hard level floor of the valley. This, too, was sand, but dried and baked  hard, and red in color. At some season of the year this immense flat  must be covered with water. How wide it was, and empty! Shefford  experienced again a feeling that had been novel to him--and it was that  he was loose, free, unanchored, ready to veer with the wind. From the  foot of the slope the water hole had appeared to be a few hundred rods  out in the valley. But the small size of the figures made Shefford  doubt; and he had to travel many times a few hundred rods before those  figures began to grow. Then Shefford made out that they were approaching  him.    Thereafter they rapidly increased to normal proportions of man and  beast. When Shefford met them he saw a powerful, heavily built young man  leading two ponies.    \"You're Mr. Presbrey, the trader?\" inquired Shefford.    \"Yes, I'm Presbrey, without the Mister,\" he replied.    \"My name's Shefford. I'm knocking about on the desert. Rode from beyond  Tuba to-day.\"    \"Glad to see you,\" said Presbrey. He offered his hand. He was a stalwart  man, clad in gray shirt, overalls, and boots. A shock of tumbled light  hair covered his massive head; he was tanned, but not darkly, and there  was red in his cheeks; under his shaggy eyebrows were deep, keen eyes;  his lips were hard and set, as if occasion for smiles or words was rare;  and his big, strong jaw seemed locked.    \"Wish more travelers came knocking around Red Lake,\" he added. \"Reckon  here's the jumping-off place.\"    \"It's pretty--lonesome,\" said Shefford, hesitating as if at a loss for  words.    Then the Indian girl came up. Presbrey addressed her in her own  language, which Shefford did not understand. She seemed shy and would  not answer; she stood with downcast face and eyes. Presbrey spoke again,  at which she pointed down the valley, and then moved on with her pony  toward the water-hole.    Presbrey's keen eyes fixed on the receding black dot far down that oval  expanse.    \"That fellow left--rather abruptly,\" said Shefford, constrainedly. \"Who  was he?\"    \"His name's Willetts. He's a missionary. He rode in to-day with this  Navajo girl. He was taking her to Blue Canyon, where he lives and  teaches the Indians. I've met him only a few times. You see, not many  white men ride in here. He's the first white man I've seen in six  months, and you're the second. Both the same day!... Red Lake's getting  popular! It's queer, though, his leaving. He expected to stay all night.  There's no other place to stay. Blue Canyon is fifty miles away.\"    \"I'm sorry to say--no, I'm not sorry, either--but I must tell you I was  the cause of Mr. Willetts leaving,\" replied Shefford.    \"How so?\" inquired the other.    Then Shefford related the incident following his arrival.    \"Perhaps my action was hasty,\" he concluded, apologetically. \"I didn't  think. Indeed, I'm surprised at myself.\"    Presbrey made no comment and his face was as hard to read as one of the  distant bluffs.    \"But what did the man mean?\" asked Shefford, conscious of a little  heat. \"I'm a stranger out here. I'm ignorant of Indians--how they're  controlled. Still I'm no fool.... If Willetts didn't mean evil, at least  he was brutal.\"    \"He was teaching her religion,\" replied Presbrey. His tone held faint  scorn and implied a joke, but his face did not change in the slightest.    Without understanding just why, Shefford felt his conviction justified  and his action approved. Then he was sensible of a slight shock of  wonder and disgust.    \"I am--I was a minister of the Gospel,\" he said to Presbrey. \"What you  hint seems impossible. I can't believe it.\"    \"I didn't hint,\" replied Presbrey, bluntly, and it was evident that  he was a sincere, but close-mouthed, man. \"Shefford, so you're a  preacher?... Did you come out here to try to convert the Indians?\"    \"No. I said I WAS a minister. I am no longer. I'm just a--a wanderer.\"    \"I see. Well, the desert's no place for missionaries, but it's good for  wanderers.... Go water your horse and take him up to the corral. You'll  find some hay for him. I'll get grub ready.\"    Shefford went on with his horse to the pool. The water appeared thick,  green, murky, and there was a line of salty crust extending around the  margin of the pool. The thirsty horse splashed in and eagerly bent his  head. But he did not like the taste. Many times he refused to drink, yet  always lowered his nose again. Finally he drank, though not his fill.  Shefford saw the Indian girl drink from her hand. He scooped up a  handful and found it too sour to swallow. When he turned to retrace his  steps she mounted her pony and followed him.    A golden flare lit up the western sky, and silhouetted dark and lonely  against it stood the trading-post. Upon his return Shefford found the  wind rising, and it chilled him. When he reached the slope thin gray  sheets of sand were blowing low, rising, whipping, falling, sweeping  along with soft silken rustle. Sometimes the gray veils hid his boots.  It was a long, toilsome climb up that yielding, dragging ascent, and he  had already been lame and tired. By the time he had put his horse away  twilight was everywhere except in the west. The Indian girl left her  pony in the corral and came like a shadow toward the house.    Shefford had difficulty in finding the foot of the stairway. He climbed  to enter a large loft, lighted by two lamps. Presbrey was there,  kneading biscuit dough in a pan.    \"Make yourself comfortable,\" he said.    The huge loft was the shape of a half-octagon. A door opened upon the  valley side, and here, too, there were windows. How attractive the place  was in comparison with the impressions gained from the outside! The  furnishings consisted of Indian blankets on the floor, two beds, a  desk and table, several chairs and a couch, a gun-rack full of rifles,  innumerable silver-ornamented belts, bridles, and other Indian articles  upon the walls, and in one corner a wood-burning stove with teakettle  steaming, and a great cupboard with shelves packed full of canned foods.    Shefford leaned in the doorway and looked out. Beneath him on a roll of  blankets sat the Indian girl, silent and motionless. He wondered what  was in her mind, what she would do, how the trader would treat her. The  slope now was a long slant of sheeted moving shadows of sand. Dusk had  gathered in the valley. The bluffs loomed beyond. A pale star twinkled  above. Shefford suddenly became aware of the intense nature of the  stillness about him. Yet, as he listened to this silence, he heard  an intermittent and immeasurably low moan, a fitful, mournful murmur.  Assuredly it was only the wind. Nevertheless, it made his blood run  cold. It was a different wind from that which had made music under  the eaves of his Illinois home. This was a lonely, haunting wind, with  desert hunger in it, and more which he could not name. Shefford listened  to this spirit-brooding sound while he watched night envelop the valley.  How black, how thick the mantle! Yet it brought no comforting sense  of close-folded protection, of walls of soft sleep, of a home. Instead  there was the feeling of space, of emptiness, of an infinite hall down  which a mournful wind swept streams of murmuring sand.    \"Well, grub's about ready,\" said Presbrey.    \"Got any water?\" asked Shefford.    \"Sure. There in the bucket. It's rain-water. I have a tank here.\"    Shefford's sore and blistered face felt better after he had washed off  the sand and alkali dust.    \"Better not wash your face often while you're in the desert. Bad plan,\"  went on Presbrey, noting how gingerly his visitor had gone about his  ablutions. \"Well, come and eat.\"    Shefford marked that if the trader did live a lonely life he fared well.  There was more on the table than twice two men could have eaten. It was  the first time in four days that Shefford had sat at a table, and he  made up for lost opportunity.    His host's actions indicated pleasure, yet the strange, hard face never  relaxed, never changed. When the meal was finished Presbrey declined  assistance, had a generous thought of the Indian girl, who, he said,  could have a place to eat and sleep "]]]
