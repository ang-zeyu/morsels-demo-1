[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#2)"],[1,"with a hotel keeper, an intelligent man, who gave me a good  deal of information about the country. He asked me where I was staying,  and, on my telling him, said \"Ah, I know it well--that village in a  hole; and a very nasty hole to get in, too--at any rate it was so,  formerly. They are getting a bit civilized now, but I remember the time  when a stranger couldn't show himself in the place without being jeered  at and insulted. Yes, they were a rough lot down in that hole--the  Badgers, they were called, and that's what they are called still.\"    The pity of it was that I didn't know this before I went among them! But  it was not remembered against me that I had wounded their  susceptibilities; they soon found that I was nothing but a harmless  field naturalist, and I had friendly relations with many of them.    At the extremity of the straggling village was the beginning of an  extensive common, where it was always possible to spend an hour or two  without seeing a human creature. A few sheep grazed and browsed there,  roaming about in twos and threes and half-dozens, tearing their fleeces  for the benefit of nest-building birds, in the great tangled masses of  mingled furze and bramble and briar. Birds were abundant there--all  those kinds that love the common's openness, and the rough, thorny  vegetation that flourishes on it. But the village--or rather, the large  open space occupied by it, formed the headquarters and centre of a  paradise of birds (as I soon began to think it), for the cottages and  houses were widely separated, the meanest having a garden and some  trees, and in most cases there was an old orchard of apple, cherry, and  walnut trees to each habitation, and out of this mass of greenery, which  hid the houses and made the place look more like a wood than a village,  towered the great elms in rows, and in groups.    On first approaching the place I heard, mingled with many other voices,  that of the nightingale; and as it was for the medicine of its pure,  fresh melody that I particularly craved, I was glad to find a lodging in  one of the cottages, and to remain there for several weeks.    The small care which the nightingale took to live up to his reputation  in this place surprised me a little. Here he could always be heard in  the daytime--not one bird, but a dozen--in different parts of the  village; but he sang not at night. This I set down to the fact that the  nights were dark and the weather unsettled. But later, when the weather  grew warmer, and there were brilliant moonlight nights, he was still a  silent bird except by day.    I was also a little surprised at his tameness.    On first coming to the village, when I ran after every nightingale I  heard, to get as near him as possible, I was occasionally led by the  sound to a cottage, and in some instances I found the singer perched  within three or four yards of an open window or door. At my own cottage,  when the woman who waited on me shook the breakfast cloth at the front  door, the bird that came to pick up the crumbs was the nightingale--not  the robin. When by chance he met a sparrow there, he attacked and chased  it away. It was a feast of nightingales. An elderly woman of the village  explained to me that the nightingales and other small birds were common  and tame in the village, because no person disturbed them. I smile now  when recording the good old dame's words.    On my second day at the village it happened to be raining--a warm,  mizzling rain without wind--ind the nightingales were as vocal as in  fine bright weather. I heard one in a narrow lane, and went towards it,  treading softly, in order not to scare it away, until I got within eight  or ten yards of it, as it sat on a dead projecting twig. This was a twig  of a low thorn tree growing up from the hedge, projecting through the  foliage, and the bird, perched near its end, sat only about five feet  above the bare ground of the lane. Now, I owe my best thanks to this  individual nightingale, for sharply calling to my mind a common  pestilent delusion, which I have always hated, but had never yet raised  my voice against--namely, that all wild creatures exist in constant fear  of an attack from the numberless subtle or powerful enemies that are  always waiting and watching for an opportunity to spring upon and  destroy them.  The truth is, that although their enemies be legion, and  that every day, and even several times on each day, they may be  threatened with destruction, they are absolutely free from apprehension,  except when in the immediate presence of danger. Suspicious they may be  at times, and the suspicion may cause them to remove themselves to a  greater distance from the object that excites it; but the emotion is so  slight, the action so almost automatic, that the singing bird will fly  to another bush a dozen yards away, and at once resume his interrupted  song. Again, a bird will see the deadliest enemy of its kind, and unless  it be so close as to actually threaten his life, he will regard it with  the greatest indifference or will only be moved to anger at its  presence.  Here was this nightingale singing in the rain, seeing but not  heeding me; while beneath the hedge, almost directly under the twig it  sat on, a black cat was watching it with luminous yellow eyes. I did not  see the cat at first, but have no doubt that the nightingale had seen  and knew that it was there. High up on the tops of the thorn, a couple  of sparrows were silently perched. Perhaps, like myself, they had come  there to listen. After I had been standing motionless, drinking in that  dulcet music for at least five minutes, one of the two sparrows dropped  from the perch straight down, and alighting on the bare wet ground  directly under the nightingale, began busily pecking at something  eatable it had discovered. No sooner had he begun pecking than out  leaped the concealed cat on to him. The sparrow fluttered wildly up from  beneath or between the claws, and escaped, as if by a miracle. The cat  raised itself up, glared round, and, catching sight of me close by,  sprang back into the hedge and was gone. But all this time the exposed  nightingale, perched only five feet above the spot where the attack had  been made and the sparrow had so nearly lost his life, had continued  singing; and he sang on for some minutes after. I suppose that he had  seen the cat before, and knew instinctively that he was beyond its  reach; that it was a terrestrial, not an aerial enemy, and so feared it  not at all; and he would, perhaps, have continued singing if the sparrow  had been caught and instantly killed.    Quite early in June I began to feel just a little cross with the  nightingales, for they almost ceased singing; and considering that the  spring had been a backward one, it seemed to me that their silence was  coming too soon. I was not sufficiently regardful of the fact that their  lays are solitary, as the poet has said; that they ask for no witness of  their song, nor thirst for human praise. They were all nesting now. But  if I heard them less, I saw much more of them, especially of one  individual, the male bird of a couple that had made their nest in a  hedge a stone's throw from the cottage. A favourite morning perch of  this bird was on a small wooden gate four or five yards away from my  window. It was an open, sunny spot, where his restless, bright eyes  could sweep the lane, up and down; and he could there also give vent to  his superfluous energy by lording it over a few sparrows and other small  birds that visited the spot. I greatly admired the fine, alert figure of  the pugnacious little creature, as he perched there so close to me, and  so fearless. His striking resemblance to the robin in form, size, and in  his motions, made his extreme familiarity seem only natural. The robin  is greatly distinguished in a sober-plumaged company by the vivid tint  on his breast. He is like the autumn leaf that catches a ray of sunlight  on its surface, and shines conspicuously among russet leaves. But the  clear brown of the nightingale is beautiful, too.    This same nightingale was keeping a little surprise in store for me.  Although he took no notice of me sitting at the open window, whenever I  went thirty or forty yards from the gate along the narrow lane that  faced it, my presence troubled him and his mate only too much. They  would flit round my head, emitting the two strongly contrasted sounds  with which they express solicitude--the clear, thin, plaintive, or  wailing note, and the low, jarring sound--an alternate lamenting and  girding. One day when I approached the nest, they displayed more anxiety  than usual, fluttering close to me, wailing and croaking more vehemently  than ever, when all at once the male, at the height of his excitement,  burst into singing. Half a dozen notes were uttered rapidly, with great  strength, then a small complaining cry again, and at intervals, a fresh  burst of melody. I have remarked the same thing in other singing birds,  species in which the harsh grating or piercing sounds that properly  express violent emotions of a painful kind, have been nearly or quite  lost. In the nightingale, this part of the bird's language has lost its  original character, and has dwindled to something very small.  Solicitude, fear, anger, are expressed with sounds that are mere  lispings compared with those emitted by the bird when singing. It is  worthy of remark that some of the most highly developed melodists--and I  am now thinking of the mocking-birds--never, in-moments of extreme  agitation, fall into this confusion and use singing notes that express  agreeable emotions, to express such as are painful. But in the  mocking-bird the primitive harsh and grating cries have not been lost  nor softened to sounds hardly to be distinguished from those that are  emitted by way of song.

And after the seven days were passed, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,  Nebka, the blessed, went forth, and Uba-aner went before him.    \"And Uba-aner said unto his majesty, 'Will your majesty come and see  this wonder that has come to pass in your days unto a page?' And the  king went with Uba-aner. And Uba-aner called unto the crocodile and  said, 'Bring forth the page.' And the crocodile came forth from the lake  with the page. Uba-aner said unto the king, 'Behold, whatever I command  this crocodile he will do it.' And his majesty said, 'I pray you send back  this crocodile.\" And Uba-aner stooped and took up the crocodile, and it  became in his hand a crocodile of wax. And then Uba-aner told the king  that which had passed in his house with the page and his wife. And his  majesty said unto the crocodile, 'Take to thee thy prey.' And the  crocodile plunged into the lake with his prey, and no man knew whither  he went.    \"And his majesty the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nebka, the blessed,  commanded, and they brought forth the wife of Uba-aner to the north side  of the harem, and burnt her with fire, and cast her ashes in the  river.    \"This is a wonder that came to pass in the days of thy forefather the  king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nebka, of the acts of the chief reciter  Uba-aner.\"    His majesty the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khufu, then said, \"Let  there be presented to the king Nebka, the blessed, a thousand loaves, a  hundred draughts of beer, an ox, two jars of incense; and let there be  presented a loaf, a jar of beer, a jar of incense, and a piece of meat  to the chief reciter Uba-aner; for I have seen the token of his  learning.\" And they did all things as his majesty commanded.          BAUFRA'S TALE      The royal sou Bau-f-ra then stood forth and spake. He said, \"I will tell  thy majesty of a wonder which came to pass in the days of thy father  Seneferu, the blessed, of the deeds of the chief reciter Zazamankh. One  day King Seneferu, being weary, went throughout his palace seeking for a  pleasure to lighten his heart, but he found none. And he said,  'Haste, and bring before me the chief reciter and scribe of the rolls  Zazamankh'; and they straightway brought him. And the king said, 'I have  sought in my palace for some delight, but I have found none.' Then said  Zazamankh to him, 'Let thy majesty go upon the lake of the palace, and  let there be made ready a boat, with all the fair maidens of the harem  of thy palace; and the heart of thy majesty shall be refreshed with  the sight, in seeing their rowing up and down the water, and seeing  the goodly pools of the birds upon the lake, and beholding its sweet  fields and grassy shores; thus will thy heart be lightened. And I also  will go with thee. Bring me twenty oars of ebony, inlayed with gold,  with blades of light wood, inlayed with electrum; and bring me twenty  maidens, fair in their limbs, their bosoms and their hair, all  virgins; and bring me twenty nets, and give these nets unto the  maidens for their garments.' And they did according to all the  commands of his majesty.    \"And they rowed down the stream and up the stream, and the heart of his  majesty was glad with the sight of their rowing. But one of them at the  steering struck her hair, and her jewel of new malachite fell into the  water. And she ceased her song, and rowed not; and her companions  ceased, and rowed not. And his majesty said, 'Row you not further?' And  they replied, 'Our little steerer here stays and rows not.' His majesty  then said to her, 'Wherefore rowest thou not?' She replied, 'It is for  my jewel of new malachite which is fallen in the water.' And he said to  her, 'Row on, for behold I will replace it.' And she answered, 'But I  want my own piece back in its setting.' And his majesty said, 'Haste,  bring me the chief reciter Zazamankh,' and they brought him. And his  majesty said, 'Zazamankh, my brother, I have done as thou sayedst, and  the heart of his majesty is refreshed with the sight of their rowing.  But now a jewel of new malachite of one of the little ones is fallen in  the water, and she ceases and rows not, and she has spoilt the rowing of  her side. And I said to her, \"Wherefore rowest thou not?\" and she  answered to me, \"It is for my jewel of new malachite which is fallen in  the water.\" I replied to her, \"Row on, for behold I will replace it\";  and she answered to me, \"But I want my own piece again back in its  setting.\"' Then the chief reciter Zazamankh spake his magic speech. And  he placed one part of the waters of the lake upon the other, and  discovered the jewel lying upon a shard; and he took it up and gave it  unto its mistress. And the water, which was twelve cubits deep in the  middle, reached now to twenty-four cubits after he turned it. And he  spake, and used his magic speech; and he brought again the water of the  lake to its place. And his majesty spent a joyful day with the whole of  the royal house. Then rewarded he the chief reciter Zazamankh with all  good things. Behold, this is a wonder that came to pass in the days of  thy father, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Seneferu, of the deeds of  the chief reciter, the scribe of the rolls, Zazamankh.\" Then said the  majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khufu, the blessed, \"Let  there be presented an offering of a thousand cakes, one hundred draughts  of beer, an ox, and two jars of incense to the king of Upper and Lower  Egypt, Sene-feru, the blessed; and let there be given a loaf, a jar of  beer, and a jar of incense to the chief reciter, the scribe of the  rolls, Zazamankh; for I have seen the token of his learning.\" And they  did all things as his majesty commanded.          HORDEDEF'S TALE      The royal son Hordedef then stood forth and spake. He said, \"Hitherto  hast thou only heard tokens of those who have gone before, and of  which no man knoweth their truth But I will show thy majesty a man of  thine own days.\" And his majesty said, \"Who is he, Hordedef?\" And the  royal son Hordedef answered, \"It is a certain man named Dedi, who  dwells at Dedsneferu. He is a man of one hundred and ten years old;  and he eats five hundred loaves of bread, and a side of beef, and  drinks one hundred draughts of beer, unto this day. He knows how to  restore the head that is smitten off; he knows how to cause the lion  to follow him trailing his halter on the ground; he knows the designs  of the dwelling of Tahuti. The majesty of the king of Upper and Lower  Egypt, Khufu, the blessed, has long sought for the designs of the  dwelling of Tahuti, that he may make the like of them in his pyramid.\"    And his majesty said, \"Thou, thyself, Hordedef, my son, bring him to  me.\" Then were the ships made ready for the king's son Hordedef, and he  went up the stream to Dedsneferu. And when the ships had moored at the  haven, he landed, and sat him in a litter of ebony, the poles of which  were of cedar wood overlayed with gold. Now when he drew near to Dedi,  they set down the litter. And he arose to greet Dedi, and found him  lying on a palmstick couch at the door of his house; one servant held  his head and rubbed him, and another rubbed his feet.    And the king's son Hordedef said, \"Thy state is that of one who lives to  good old age; for old age is the end of our voyage, the time of  embalming, the time of burial. Lie, then, in the sun, free of  infirmities, without the babble of dotage: this is the salutation to  worthy age. I come from far to call thee, with a message from my father  Khufu, the blessed, for thou shalt eat of the best which the king gives,  and of the food which those have who follow after him; that he may bring  thee in good estate to thy fathers who are in the tomb.\"    And Dedi replied to him, \"Peace to thee! Peace to thee! Hordedef, son of  the king, beloved of his father. May thy father Khufu, the blessed,  praise thee, may he advance thee amongst the elders, may thy _ka_ prevail  against the enemy, may thy soul know the right road to the gate of him  who clothes the afflicted; this is the salutation to the king's son.\"  Then the king's son, Hordedef, stretched forth his hands to him, and  raised him up, and went with him to the haven, giving unto him his arm.  Then said Dedi, \"Let there he given me a boat, to bring me my youths and  my books.\" And they made ready for him two boats with their rowers. And  Dedi went down the river in the barge in which was the king's son  Hordedef. And when he had reached the palace, the king's son, Hordedef,  entered in to give account unto his majesty the king of Upper and Lower  Egypt, Khufu, the blessed. Then said the king's son Hordedef, \"O king,  life, wealth, and health! My lord, I have brought Dedi.\" His majesty  replied, \"Bring him to me speedily.\" And his majesty went into the hall  of columns of Pharaoh (life, wealth, and health), and Dedi was led  before him. And his majesty said, \"Wherefore is it, Dedi, that I have  not yet seen thee?\" And Dedi answered, \"He who is called it is that  comes; the king (life, wealth, and health) calls me, and behold I  come,\" And his majesty said, \"Is it true, that which men say, that  thou canst restore the head which is smitten off?\" And Dedi replied,  \"Truly, I know that, O king (life, wealth, and health), my lord.\" And  his majesty said, \"Let one bring me a prisoner who is in prison, that  his punishment may be fulfilled.\" And Dedi said, \"Let it not be a man,  O king, my lord; behold we do not even thus to our cattle.\" And a duck  was brought unto him, and its head was cut off. And the duck was laid  on the west side of the hall, and its head on the east side of the  hall. And Dedi spake his magic speech. And the duck fluttered along  the ground, and its head came likewise; and when it had come part to  part the duck stood and quacked. And they brought likewise a goose  before him, and he did even so unto it. His majesty caused an ox to be"]]]
