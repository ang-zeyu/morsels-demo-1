Wheat! Wheat!\" \"Here! Here! Here!\" and  \"Cheer! Cheer! Cheer!\"  This so delighted the king that he whistled  them over and over and helped the youngster all he could.    He was so proud of him that this same night he gave him his first  lesson in tucking his head properly and going to sleep alone.  In a few  more days, when he was sure of his wing strength, he gave him  instructions in flying.  He taught him how to spread his wings and  slowly sail from tree to tree; how to fly in short broken curves, to  avoid the aim of a hunter; how to turn abruptly in air and make a quick  dash after a bug or an enemy.  He taught him the proper angle at which  to breast a stiff wind, and that he always should meet a storm head  first, so that the water would run as the plumage lay.    His first bathing lesson was a pronounced success.  The Cardinal  enjoyed water like a duck.  He bathed, splashed, and romped until his  mother was almost crazy for fear he would attract a watersnake or  turtle; but the element of fear was not a part of his disposition.  He  learned to dry, dress, and plume his feathers, and showed such  remarkable pride in keeping himself immaculate, that although only a  youngster, he was already a bird of such great promise, that many of  the feathered inhabitants of the Limberlost came to pay him a call.    Next, the king took him on a long trip around the swamp, and taught him  to select the proper places to hunt for worms; how to search under  leaves for plant-lice and slugs for meat; which berries were good and  safe, and the kind of weeds that bore the most and best seeds.  He  showed him how to find tiny pebbles to grind his food, and how to  sharpen and polish his beak.    Then he took up the real music lessons, and taught him how to whistle  and how to warble and trill.  \"Good Cheer! Good Cheer!\" intoned the  king.  \"Coo Cher! Coo Cher!\" imitated the Cardinal.  These songs were  only studied repetitions, but there was a depth and volume in his voice  that gave promise of future greatness, when age should have developed  him, and experience awakened his emotions.  He was an excellent  musician for a youngster.    He soon did so well in caring for himself, in finding food and in  flight, and grew so big and independent, that he made numerous  excursions alone through the Limberlost; and so impressive were his  proportions, and so aggressive his manner, that he suffered no  molestation.  In fact, the reign of the king promised to end speedily;  but if he feared it he made no sign, and his pride in his wonderful  offspring was always manifest.  After the Cardinal had explored the  swamp thoroughly, a longing for a wider range grew upon him; and day  after day he lingered around the borders, looking across the wide  cultivated fields, almost aching to test his wings in one long, high,  wild stretch of flight.    A day came when the heat of the late summer set the marsh steaming, and  the Cardinal, flying close to the borders, caught the breeze from the  upland; and the vision of broad fields stretching toward the north so  enticed him that he spread his wings, and following the line of trees  and fences as much as possible, he made his first journey from home.  That day was so delightful it decided his fortunes.  It would seem that  the swamp, so appreciated by his kindred, should have been sufficient  for the Cardinal, but it was not.  With every mile he winged his  flight, came a greater sense of power and strength, and a keener love  for the broad sweep of field and forest.  His heart bounded with the  zest of rocking on the wind, racing through the sunshine, and sailing  over the endless panorama of waving corn fields, and woodlands.    The heat and closeness of the Limberlost seemed a prison well escaped,  as on and on he flew in straight untiring flight.  Crossing a field of  half-ripened corn that sloped to the river, the Cardinal saw many birds  feeding there, so he alighted on a tall tree to watch them.  Soon he  decided that he would like to try this new food.  He found a place  where a crow had left an ear nicely laid open, and clinging to the  husk, as he saw the others do, he stretched to his full height and  drove his strong sharp beak into the creamy grain.  After the stifling  swamp hunting, after the long exciting flight, to rock on this swaying  corn and drink the rich milk of the grain, was to the Cardinal his  first taste of nectar and ambrosia.  He lifted his head when he came to  the golden kernel, and chipping it in tiny specks, he tasted and  approved with all the delight of an epicure in a delicious new dish.    Perhaps there were other treats in the next field.  He decided to fly  even farther.  But he had gone only a short distance when he changed  his course and turned to the South, for below him was a long, shining,  creeping thing, fringed with willows, while towering above them were  giant sycamore, maple, tulip, and elm trees that caught and rocked with  the wind; and the Cardinal did not know what it was.  Filled with  wonder he dropped lower and lower.  Birds were everywhere, many flying  over and dipping into it; but its clear creeping silver was a mystery  to the Cardinal.    The beautiful river of poetry and song that the Indians first  discovered, and later with the French, named Ouabache; the winding  shining river that Logan and Me-shin-go-me-sia loved; the only river  that could tempt Wa-ca-co-nah from the Salamonie and Mississinewa; the  river beneath whose silver sycamores and giant maples Chief Godfrey  pitched his campfires, was never more beautiful than on that perfect  autumn day.    With his feathers pressed closely, the Cardinal alighted on a willow,  and leaned to look, quivering with excitement and uttering explosive  \"chips\"; for there he was, face to face with a big redbird that  appeared neither peaceful nor timid.  He uttered an impudent \"Chip\" of  challenge, which, as it left his beak, was flung back to him.  The  Cardinal flared his crest and half lifted his wings, stiffening them at  the butt; the bird he was facing did the same.  In his surprise he  arose to his full height with a dexterous little side step, and the  other bird straightened and side-stepped exactly with him.  This was  too insulting for the Cardinal.  Straining every muscle, he made a dash  at the impudent stranger.    He struck the water with such force that it splashed above the willows,  and a kingfisher, stationed on a stump opposite him, watching the  shoals for minnows, saw it.  He spread his beak and rolled forth  rattling laughter, until his voice reechoed from point to point down  the river.  The Cardinal scarcely knew how he got out, but he had  learned a new lesson.  That beautiful, shining, creeping thing was  water; not thick, tepid, black marsh water, but pure, cool, silver  water.  He shook his plumage, feeling a degree redder from shame, but  he would not be laughed into leaving.  He found it too delightful.  In  a short time he ventured down and took a sip, and it was the first real  drink of his life.  Oh, but it was good!    When thirst from the heat and his long flight was quenched, he ventured  in for a bath, and that was a new and delightful experience.  How he  splashed and splashed, and sent the silver drops flying! How he ducked  and soaked and cooled in that rippling water, in which he might remain  as long as he pleased and splash his fill; for he could see the bottom  for a long distance all around, and easily could avoid anything  attempting to harm him.  He was so wet when his bath was finished he  scarcely could reach a bush to dry and dress his plumage.    Once again in perfect feather, he remembered the bird of the water, and  returned to the willow.  There in the depths of the shining river the  Cardinal discovered himself, and his heart swelled big with just pride.  Was that broad full breast his?  Where had he seen any other cardinal  with a crest so high it waved in the wind?  How big and black his eyes  were, and his beard was almost as long and crisp as his father's.  He  spread his wings and gloated on their sweep, and twisted and flirted  his tail.  He went over his toilet again and dressed every feather on  him.  He scoured the back of his neck with the butt of his wings, and  tucking his head under them, slowly drew it out time after time to  polish his crest.  He turned and twisted.  He rocked and paraded, and  every glimpse he caught of his size and beauty filled him with pride.  He strutted like a peacock and chattered like a jay.    When he could find no further points to admire, something else caught  his attention.  When he \"chipped\" there was an answering \"Chip\" across  the river; certainly there was no cardinal there, so it must be that he  was hearing his own voice as well as seeing himself.  Selecting a  conspicuous perch he sent an incisive \"Chip!\" across the water, and in  kind it came back to him.  Then he \"chipped\" softly and tenderly, as he  did in the Limberlost to a favourite little sister who often came and  perched beside him in the maple where he slept, and softly and tenderly  came the answer.  Then the Cardinal understood.  \"Wheat! Wheat! Wheat!\"  He whistled it high, and he whistled it low.  \"Cheer! Cheer!  Cheer!\"  He whistled it tenderly and sharply and imperiously.  \"Here! Here!  Here!\"  At this ringing command, every bird, as far as the river  carried his voice, came to investigate and remained to admire. Over and  over he rang every change he could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale.

I paid it years ago, and simply got an acknowledgement  from him, but did not go through some other form, satisfying the  judgment, I think they term it.\"    \"Well, I am sure no one would ever doubt your word,\" cried Kate, \"even  if these papers cannot be found.\"    \"I am afraid, my dear child, the great mass of legal and money-lending  people do not come within the category of christians, who 'believe all  things.' I must write to Moore this very day, I'll be in time for the  Irish post, give me my desk, Kate.\"    \"But suppose this man insists on the production of these papers, and  you cannot satisfy him?\" asked Kate, as she was leaving the room after  arranging the Colonel's writing materials.    He looked up with a sudden expression of pain in his noble, benevolent  countenance.    \"We shall be beggars, my child! that's all.\"    Miss Vernon walked into the drawing-room, and opened the piano  mechanically; while her thoughts were busily engaged in conjecturing  whether the lingering debility of indisposition, rather than justly  grounded fears, prompted her grandfather's gloomy view of Lady  Desmond's intelligence.    \"Shall we then really know the poverty, nurse talks of? Shall I be  strong enough to say, in sincerity, '_Thy will be done!_'\"    But soon these gloomy speculations gave place to the pleasanter  topic of her cousin's invitation, which seemed to have escaped her  grandfather's notice.    She had been _thus_ meditating for some time, when nurse entered with a  letter in her hand.    \"The master's love, Miss Kate, and if it's not too early he'd like you  to go out wid him, he says he does not feel so well!\"    \"Yes, nurse, I will go and get my bonnet and shawl, when I have settled  this music.\"    \"Faith now, alannah, I'm not plaised at all with the looks iv him!\"    \"How?\" said Kate, suspending her occupation of replacing the books in  the music-stand, and looking up anxiously in Mrs. O'Toole's face, which  wore an unusual look of care, especially about the depressed corners of  her expressive mouth.    \"Sorra one iv me can tell why, but he looks like as when a big black  cloud is beginin' to be dhrawn over the sun in a fine summer's day;  he just sits in the chair tired like; an ses he, 'only one letther  for the post, nurse,' ses he, 'but be sure it's in time for the Irish  maal,' and then he give me the message, I gave yes. The Cross iv Christ  betune us an harum, ses I, as soon as I see 'J. Moore, Esquire,' on the  letther; how are we to have luck or grace when we have any thing to say  to the man that sould Dungar, an give it up to the spalpeen that has it  now; look Miss Kate, thim's the Esquires that's going now! Faith an I  remember Paddy Moore, his father, carrying sacks iv corn to the mill,  an meself own maid up at the big house! Ay, then, J. Moore, Esquire,  ye'r the first esquire in yer family, any ways, an there was ever an  always sorra to sup when there was letthers goin back an forward betune  you an the masther!\"    \"But, nurse, I have always heard that Mr. Moore was an upright  honourable man, and I hope grandpapa's letter will be only productive  of good.\"    \"Well, well, may be so, but I'd a mighty quare dhrame both last night  an the night afore. Oh, ye may laugh now, Miss Kate, but no matther!  I seen the masther as plain as I see yer own sweet face forenent me,  slippin, slippin down a steep slim place wid the say roarin mad ondher,  an you houlding him for the dear life, an yer round white arms all  strained an tremblin wid the weight that was too much for yez, an I  couldn't help yez, tho' I struve an struve to run to yez; an in the  struggle I woke up, all in a shake; an God forgive the word, but it's a  mighty bad dhrame intirely!\"    \"No, Nurse--you say dreams go by contraries, so it is grandpapa that  will be ascending some lofty eminence and dragging me after him.\"    \"It was in the mornin', asthore, in the mornin' I dhreamt it.\"    \"Never mind, nurse, if so, God will lend these slight arms strength for  all that may be required of them--do not tell me any more dreams now,  I must go to grandpapa.\"    \"Sweet Mary, shield ye darlint!\" ejaculated Mrs. O'Toole, as she looked  after her nursling, \"but we've rested so long widout them thieving  attorneys, I don't like to see them beginin' their letthers agin. _J.  Moore, esquire!_ the divil go wid such esquires! amen.\"    Fearful and wonderful indeed is our spiritual organisation. Reason  may smile at fears, unsubstantiated by any tangible motive, but the  instant her accents of reproof have ceased, lo! the same formless and  gnawing terror steals back, undiminished by one iota of its influence,  to depress the soul, until again routed by reason's disciplined troops;  a true guerilla warfare in which the irregular forces, ever ready to  disperse and reassemble, always repulsed, but never conquered, are sure  to wear out resistance in the end.    So Kate Vernon, in spite of her clear and cultivated intellect,  her sound judgment, and her sense of the ridiculous, could not keep  nurse's evil omen from dwelling on her mind; more, ay, a thousand times  more, than her grandfather's apparent anxiety about the intelligence  communicated by Lady Desmond, and they accomplished the circuit of the  walls, silently, or, exchanging occasional remarks very foreign from  the subject occupying both their minds.    At length the Colonel said abruptly--    \"Kate, my child, what do you think of Lady Desmond's invitation?\"    \"Oh! I think it a delightful plan; but you, grandpapa, do you think we  shall be able to accept it?\"    \"At present decidedly not. I must not be farther from Dublin than I  am--I fear I shall have much letter writing, if indeed I am not obliged  to go to Ireland myself; if matters come right again, I shall certainly  endeavour to let the Priory, and take you to Italy; this complete  retirement is not good or safe.\"    \"Safe!\" said Kate, laughing. \"Why I thought it was quite _selon les  regles_, of all romances, that a dethroned prince, and his lovely and  interesting daughter, like you and I, should be safe only while in  obscurity.\"    \"According to old romances, I grant; but according to reality, there is  more danger in the strong contrasts which the occasional breaks in a  life of retirement present, in the tone of mind it engenders, than in  the action of society, at least to you, Kate.\"    \"Danger! Oh, tempt me not to boast,\" cried Kate, endeavouring to  draw her grandfather from his moralising mood. \"You may despise old  romances, but you are nevertheless assuming the tone of some melancholy  Count Alphonso, warning a sensitive and angelic Lady Malvina, against  the world in general: dearest and best,\" she continued, in graver and  tenderer tones, \"I must swim down the troubled current of life, as you  have done before me, and meet its difficulties and trials--leave me  then to the same guide by whose aid, you have passed many a dangerous  rapid safely, to float in a smooth, though diminutive haven at last.\"    \"You are right, Kate, quite right; but how much longer the smoothness  will last, God only knows.\"    \"Well, there _is_ a God, to know all, and direct all, and that  consciousness, must rob the future of all apprehension. Shall I write  to Lady Desmond, on our return, and tell her of our indecision and its  causes?\"    \"By all means. Yet, dear child, I wish _you_ would accept her  invitation, you want change, and I could remain quite comfortably with  nurse and--\"    \"Do not utter such treason! Leave you! and to amuse myself in Italy,  when there is a chance that so far from being able to do without me,  you may peculiarly want me.\"    \"My dear, dear, unselfish child.\"    \"Not a bit unselfish--_tout au contraire_. I should be miserable away,  besides--but here are our friends, Winter and Gilpin, so, dearest  grandpapa, leave the future to take care of itself; all will be  arranged for the best.\"    There was no time to say more, as the painter and organist approached;  but though the Colonel made no reply, some unexplained current of  feeling induced him to pass his arm through Kate's, instead of offering  it, as was his habit, for her support.    \"Ha! Miss Vernon, I see you have taken advantage of a stray gleam of  sun, to seduce the Colonel into risking another cold--the wind is truly  detestable, but as I could not keep Gilpin in doors, I came out with  him, he has not a grain of prudence!\"    \"My dear Winter, it is a remarkable fine day for March, I am glad,  Gilpin, you felt equal to a walk.\"    \"I think you look better,\" observed Kate.    \"Yes: I think I am better, I feel to revive at the approach, however  boisterous, of spring.\"    \"_Cospetto!_ three months in Italy would make you a new man; but here,  the great mystery to me is, how any one who catches a cold ever loses  it.\"    \"The remedy is worse than the disease; imagine a depressed invalid in  a strange country, without a single friend, or, even acquaintance, and  ignorant of its language,\" returned Gilpin.    \"Wretched indeed! but wait for me, Mr. Gilpin, we have some thoughts of  taking a flight to Italy, this summer,\" said Miss Vernon.    \"_Corpo di Baccho!_ I'll not be left behind: to act as Miss Vernon's  _cicerone_, would be something more than commonly delightful--what a  state of enjoyment you would be in; but what put such a move into your  head, Colonel?\"    \"An invitation from Lady Desmond, who is at Florence,\" said Colonel  Vernon, \"Our acceptance of it however is very uncertain, though I see  Kate is full of the project. I had another letter, Messieurs, which I  think will give you pleasure--here; read it, Winter.\"    \"Bombay--Fred Egerton--_che gusto_.\"    A quick glance at Kate. The whole party moved"]]]
