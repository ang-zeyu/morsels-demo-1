A STRANGE RELIGIOUS EPIC--AN ISRAELITISH TYPE OF WOMAN IN THE AGE.    AN epic of woman! Not in all the ages has there been one like unto it.    Fuller of romance than works of fiction are the lives of the Mormon  women. So strange and thrilling is their story,--so rare in its  elements of experience,--that neither history nor fable affords a  perfect example; yet is it a reality of our own times.    Women with new types of character, antique rather than modern; themes  ancient, but transposed to our latter-day experience. Women with  their eyes open, and the prophecy of their work and mission in their  own utterances, who have dared to enter upon the path of religious  empire-founding with as much divine enthusiasm as had the apostles  who founded Christendom. Such are the Mormon women,--religious  empire-founders, in faith and fact. Never till now did woman essay  such an extraordinary character; never before did woman rise to the  conception of so supreme a mission in her own person and life.    We can only understand the Mormon sisterhood by introducing them in  this cast at the very outset; only comprehend the wonderful story of  their lives by viewing them as apostles, who have heard the voices of  the invisibles commanding them to build the temples of a new faith.    Let us forget, then, thus early in their story, all reference to  polygamy or monogamy. Rather let us think of them as apostolic mediums  of a new revelation, who at first saw only a dispensation of divine  innovations and manifestations for the age. Let us view them purely as  prophetic women, who undertook to found their half of a new Christian  empire, and we have exactly the conception with which to start the epic  story of the Women of Mormondom.    They had been educated by the Hebrew Bible, and their minds cast by its  influence, long before they saw the book of Mormon or heard the Mormon  prophet. The examples of the ancient apostles were familiar to them,  and they had yearned for the pentecosts of the early days. But most had  they been enchanted by the themes of the old Jewish prophets, whose  writings had inspired them with faith in the literal renewal of the  covenant with Israel, and the \"restitution of all things\" of Abrahamic  promise. This was the case with nearly all of the early disciples of  Mormonism,--men and women. They were not as _sinners_ converted to  Christianity, but as _disciples_ who had been waiting for the \"fullness  of the everlasting gospel.\" Thus had they been prepared for the new  revelation,--an Israel born unto the promises,--an Israel afterwards  claiming that in a pre-existent state they were the elect of God.  They had also inherited their earnest religious characters from their  fathers and mothers. The pre-natal influences of generations culminated  in the bringing forth of this Mormon Israel.    And here we come to the remarkable fact that the women who, with its  apostles and elders, founded Mormondom, were the Puritan daughters of  New England, even as were their compeer brothers its sons.    Sons and daughters of the sires and mothers who founded this great  nation; sons and daughters of the sires and mothers who fought and  inspired the war of the revolution, and gave to this continent a magna  charta of religious and political liberty! Their stalwart fathers also  wielded the \"sword of the Lord\" in old England, with Cromwell and his  Ironsides, and the self-sacrificing spirit of their pilgrim mothers  sustained New England in the heat and burden of the day, while its  primeval forests were being cleared, even as these pilgrim Mormons  pioneered our nation the farthest West, and converted the great  American desert into fruitful fields.    That those who established the Mormon Church are of this illustrious  origin we shall abundantly see, in the record of these lives, confirmed  by direct genealogical links. Some of their sires were even governors  of the British colonies at their very rise: instance the ancestor  of Daniel H. Wells, one of the presidents of the Mormon Church, who  was none other than the illustrious Thomas Wells, fourth governor of  Connecticut; instance the pilgrim forefather of the apostles Orson  and Parley Pratt, who came from England to America in 1633, and with  the Rev. Thomas Hooker and his congregation pioneered through dense  wildernesses, inhabited only by savages and wild beasts, and became  the founders of the colony of Hartford, Conn., in June, 1636; instance  the Youngs, the Kimballs, the Smiths, the Woodruffs, the Lymans, the  Snows, the Carringtons, the Riches, the Hunters, the Huntingtons, the  Patridges, the Whitneys, and a host of other early disciples of the  Mormon Church. Their ancestors were among the very earliest settlers of  the English colonies. There is good reason, indeed, to believe that on  board the Mayflower was some of the blood that has been infused into  the Mormon Church.    This genealogical record, upon which the Mormon people pride  themselves, has a vast meaning, not only in accounting for their  empire-founding genius and religious career, but also for their Hebraic  types of character and themes of faith. Their genius is in their very  blood. They are, as observed, a latter-day Israel,--born inheritors of  the promise,--predestined apostles, both men and women, of the greater  mission of this nation,--the elect of the new covenant of God, which  America is destined to unfold to \"every nation, kindred, tongue and  people.\" This is not merely an author's fancy; it is an affirmation and  a prophecy well established in Mormon myth and themes.    If we but truthfully trace the pre-natal expositions of this peculiar  people--and the sociologist will at once recognize in this method a  very book of revelation on the subject--we shall soon come to look upon  these strange Israelitish types and wonders as simply a hereditary  culmination in the nineteenth century.    Mormonism, indeed, is not altogether a new faith, nor a fresh  inspiration in the world. The facts disclose that its genius has come  down to the children, through generations, in the very blood which the  invisibles inspired in old England, in the seventeenth century, and  which wrought such wonders of God among the nations then. That blood  has been speaking in our day with prophet tongue; those wonderful  works, wrought in the name of the Lord of Hosts, by the saints of the  commonwealth, to establish faith in Israel's God and reverence for His  name above all earthly powers, are, in their consummation in America,  wrought by these latter-day saints in the same august name and for the  same purpose. He shall be honored among the nations; His will done  among men; His name praised to the ends of the earth! Such was the  affirmation of the saints of the commonwealth of England two hundred  and"]]]
