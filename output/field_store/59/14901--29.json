For save Connla alone, none saw the Fairy Maiden.    \"To whom art thou talking, my son?\" said Conn the king.    Then the maiden answered, \"Connla speaks to a young, fair maid, whom  neither death nor old age awaits. I love Connla, and now I call him  away to the Plain of Pleasure, Moy Mell, where Boadag is king for aye,  nor has there been complaint or sorrow in that land since he has held  the kingship. Oh, come with me, Connla of the Fiery Hair, ruddy as the  dawn with thy tawny skin. A fairy crown awaits thee to grace thy comely  face and royal form. Come, and never shall thy comeliness fade, nor thy  youth, till the last awful day of judgment.\"    The king in fear at what the maiden said, which he heard though he  could not see her, called aloud to his Druid, Coran by name.    \"Oh, Coran of the many spells,\" he said, \"and of the cunning magic, I  call upon thy aid. A task is upon me too great for all my skill and  wit, greater than any laid upon me since I seized the kingship. A  maiden unseen has met us, and by her power would take from me my dear,  my comely son. If thou help not, he will be taken from thy king by  woman's wiles and witchery.\"    Then Coran the Druid stood forth and chanted his spells towards the  spot where the maiden's voice had been heard. And none heard her voice  again, nor could Connla see her longer. Only as she vanished before the  Druid's mighty spell, she threw an apple to Connla.    For a whole month from that day Connla would take nothing, either to  eat or to drink, save only from that apple. But as he ate it grew again  and always kept whole. And all the while there grew within him a mighty  yearning and longing after the maiden he had seen.    But when the last day of the month of waiting came, Connla stood by the  side of the king his father on the Plain of Arcomin, and again he saw  the maiden come towards him, and again she spoke to him.    \"'Tis a glorious place, forsooth, that Connla holds among short-lived  mortals awaiting the day of death. But now the folk of life, the  ever-living ones, beg and bid thee come to Moy Mell, the Plain of  Pleasure, for they have learnt to know thee, seeing thee in thy home  among thy dear ones.\"    When Conn the king heard the maiden's voice he called to his men aloud  and said:    \"Summon swift my Druid Coran, for I see she has again this day the  power of speech.\"    Then the maiden said: \"Oh, mighty Conn, fighter of a hundred fights,  the Druid's power is little loved; it has little honour in the mighty  land, peopled with so many of the upright. When the Law will come, it  will do away with the Druid's magic spells that come from the lips of  the false black demon.\"    Then Conn the king observed that since the maiden came, Connla his son  spoke to none that spake to him. So Conn of the hundred fights said to  him, \"Is it to thy mind what the woman says, my son?\"    \"'Tis hard upon me,\" then said Connla; \"I love my own folk above all  things; but yet, but yet a longing seizes me for the maiden.\"    When the maiden heard this, she answered and said \"The ocean is not so  strong as the waves of thy longing. Come with me in my curragh, the  gleaming, straight-gliding crystal canoe. Soon we can reach Boadag's  realm. I see the bright sun sink, yet far as it is, we can reach it  before dark. There is, too, another land worthy of thy journey, a land  joyous to all that seek it. Only wives and maidens dwell there. If thou  wilt, we can seek it and live there alone together in joy.\"    When the maiden ceased to speak, Connla of the Fiery Hair rushed away  from them and sprang into the curragh, the gleaming, straight-gliding  crystal canoe. And then they all, king and court, saw it glide away  over the bright sea towards the setting sun. Away and away, till eye  could see it no longer, and Connla and the Fairy Maiden went their way  on the sea, and were no more seen, nor did any know where they came.          GULEESH    There was once a boy in the County Mayo; Guleesh was his name. There  was the finest rath a little way off from the gable of the house, and  he was often in the habit of seating himself on the fine grass bank  that was running round it. One night he stood, half leaning against the  gable of the house, and looking up into the sky, and watching the  beautiful white moon over his head. After he had been standing that way  for a couple of hours, he said to himself: \"My bitter grief that I am  not gone away out of this place altogether. I'd sooner be any place in  the world than here. Och, it's well for you, white moon,\" says he,  \"that's turning round, turning round, as you please yourself, and no  man can put you back. I wish I was the same as you.\"    Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard a great noise coming  like the sound of many people running together, and talking, and  laughing, and making sport, and the sound went by him like a whirl of  wind, and he was listening to it going into the rath. \"Musha, by my  soul,\" says he, \"but ye're merry enough, and I'll follow ye.\"    What was in it but the fairy host, though he did not know at first that  it was they who were in it, but he followed them into the rath. It's  there he heard the _fulparnee_, and the _folpornee_, the  _rap-lay-hoota_, and the _roolya-boolya_, that they had there, and  every man of them crying out as loud as he could: \"My horse, and  bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!\"    \"By my hand,\" said Guleesh, \"my boy, that's not bad. I'll imitate ye,\"  and he cried out as well as they: \"My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My  horse, and bridle, and saddle!\" And on the moment there was a fine  horse with a bridle of gold, and a saddle of silver, standing before  him. He leaped up on it, and the moment he was on its back he saw  clearly that the rath was full of horses, and of little people going  riding on them.    Said a man of them to him: \"Are you coming with us to-night, Guleesh?\"    \"I am surely,\" said Guleesh.    \"If you are, come along,\" said the little man, and out they went all  together, riding like the wind, faster than the fastest horse ever you  saw a-hunting, and faster than the fox and the hounds at his tail.    The cold winter's wind that was before them, they overtook her, and the  cold winter's wind that was behind them, she did not overtake them. And  stop nor stay of that full race, did they make none, until they came to  the brink of the sea.    Then every one of them said: \"Hie over cap! Hie over cap!\" and that  moment they were up in the air, and before Guleesh had time to remember  where he was, they were down on dry land again, and were going like the  wind.    At last they stood still, and a man of them said to Guleesh: \"Guleesh,  do you know where you are now?\"    \"Not a know,\" says Guleesh.    \"You're in France, Guleesh,\" said he. \"The daughter of the king of  France is to be married to-night, the handsomest woman that the sun  ever saw, and we must do our best to bring her with us; if we're only  able to carry her off; and you must come with us that we may be able to  put the young girl up behind you on the horse, when we'll be bringing  her away, for it's not lawful for us to put her sitting behind  ourselves. But you're flesh and blood, and she can take a good grip of  you, so that she won't fall off the horse. Are you satisfied, Guleesh,  and will you do what we're telling you?\"    \"Why shouldn't I be satisfied?\" said Guleesh. \"I'm satisfied, surely,  and anything that ye will tell me to do I'll do it without doubt.\"    They got off their horses there, and a man of them said a word that  Guleesh did not understand, and on the moment they were lifted up, and  Guleesh found himself and his companions in the palace. There was a  great feast going on there, and there was not a nobleman or a gentleman  in the kingdom but was gathered there, dressed in silk and satin, and  gold and silver, and the night was as bright as the day with all the  lamps and candles that were lit, and Guleesh had to shut his two eyes  at the brightness. When he opened them again and looked from him, he  thought he never saw anything as fine as all he saw there. There were a  hundred tables spread out, and their full of meat and drink on each  table of them, flesh-meat, and cakes and sweetmeats, and wine and ale,  and every drink that ever a man saw. The musicians were at the two ends  of the hall, and they were playing the sweetest music that ever a man's  ear heard, and there were young women and fine youths in the middle of  the hall, dancing and turning, and going round so quickly and so  lightly, that it put a _soorawn_ in Guleesh's head to be looking at  them. There were more there playing tricks, and more making fun and  laughing, for such a feast as there was that day had not been in France  for twenty years, because the old king had no children alive but only  the one daughter, and she was to be married to the son of another king  that night. Three days the feast was going on, and the third night she  was to be married, and that was the night that Guleesh and the  sheehogues came, hoping, if they could, to carry off with them the  king's young daughter.    Guleesh and his companions were standing together at the head of the  hall, where there was a fine altar dressed up, and two bishops behind  it waiting to marry the girl, as soon as the right time should come.  Now nobody could see the sheehogues, for they said a word as they came  in, that made them all invisible, as if they had not been in it at all.    \"Tell me which of them is the king's daughter,\" said Guleesh, when he  was becoming a little used to the noise and the light.    \"Don't you see her there away from you?\" said the little man that he  was talking to.

Who was it chose that gray monk if not you? Well then a prelate        Now is my lover--Ah, who is my prelate but you?      Never, incredible as it may sound in this clerical city,        Has any cleric brought me--swear it I will--to his bed.      I was sufficiently poor, sad to say. I was young. The seducers        Noted it well. Falconier ogled me often enough.      One of the pimps for Albani with billets doux very impressive        Called me to Ostia once. Quattro Fontani next time.      Who was it did not appear there? Why, who but the very same girl who        Hated with all of her heart stockings both violet and red.      For: 'In the end you poor girls are the ones who are sure to be cheated.'        So said my father although--Mother was not much impressed.      Father was right. Here I stand in the end being cheated and scolded.        You don't believe your own words. They're your excuse to escape.      Go, then. Unworthy of women are men. We, who carry your children        Next to our hearts, in these hearts loyalty we bear you, too.      As for you men, when you've poured out your potency in our embraces        And your desires dissipate, love with them passes away.\"      These things expressed, and taking her child from its chair, my beloved        Presses it close to her heart, kisses it, tears in her eyes.      I'm now so very ashamed of myself for having permitted        Gossip of neighbors to spoil picture so eloquent.      For a short moment a fire may burn darkly while smoke swirls about it.        Water dashed on the coals suddenly smothers their glow.      Rapidly then renewed heat overcomes those lowering vapors,        Sends up a flame that anew bright and more powerful gleams.          IX      How very happy I am here in Rome when I think of the bad days        Far back there in the north, wrapped in a grayish light.      Over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy;        Colorless, formless, that world round this exhausted man lay.      Seeking myself in myself, an unsatisfied spirit, I brooded,        Spying out pathways dark, lost in dreary reflection.      Here in an aether more clear now a luster encircles my forehead.        Phoebus the god evokes forms, clear are his colors by day.      Bright with the stars comes the evening, ringing with songs that are tender,        And the glow of the moon, brighter than northern sun.      What blessedness mortals may know! Am I now dreaming? Or welcomes        Jupiter, Father, as guest--me, to ambrosial halls?      See, I lie here extending my arms toward your knees. I am praying:        Hospitality's god, Jupiter Xenius! Hear:      How I am come to this place I no longer can say--I was        Seized up by Hebe.  'Twas she led to this sacred hill.      Did you command her a hero to seek and deliver before you?        May be she erred. Then forgive. Let her mistake profit me!      Does not Fortuna, your daughter, when strewing her glorious presents,        After the manner of girls, yield to each passing whim?      You, O hospitable god, will by no means now banish a stranger        From your Olympian heights back to the base earth again.      \"Poet, come to your senses!\"--Forgive me, Jupiter, is not        Rome's Capitoline Hill second Olympus to you?      Suffer me, Jupiter, here and let Hermes guide me at last then        Past Cestius' Tomb gently to Orkus below.          X      When you were small, you say, neither did others consider you f air, nor        Even your mother find praise--and I believe it--      Till you grew bigger, developing quietly over the years. I        Picture you to myself as an unusual child.      Also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting in shape and in color,        Although the fruit when it's ripe pleases both mankind and gods.          XI      Kindling autumnal fire in a rustic, convivial fireplace        (How the sticks crackle and spew flames and glittering sparks!)      Strikes me especially pleasant this evening.  Before all my tinder        Dies away into coals, coals then to ashes decline,      She will be back and new faggots as well as big logs will be blazing,        Making a festival where lovers will warm up the night.      Then in the morning, officious, she'll leave the bed of her lover,        Rouse adroitly the flames out from their ashes anew.      Cupid has lent to her above others the gift of cajoling        Up from the ashes desire, just when slumber's begun.          XII      All of those greats: Alexander, Caesar and Henry and Fredrick,        Gladly would share with me half of their hard fought renown,      Could I but grant them my bed for one single night, and its comfort,        But the poor wretches are held stark in cold Orkian grip.      Therefore, ye living, rejoice that love keeps you warm for a while yet,        Until cold Lethe anoints, captures your foot in its flight.          XIII      They are for you, O ye graces, just a few leaves by a poet        Onto your pure altar laid, buds of the rose beside,      Offered in confidence.  Artists enjoy ateliers which are furnished        So as to make for a space Pantheon-like in decor:      Jupiter lowers that godly brow while his Juno looks upward;        Phoebus takes forward strides, shaking his curly head;      While phlegmatic Minerva peers down on us, frivolous Hermes        Seems to be looking askance, roguish, though tender as well.      But it's to Bacchus, the sensuous dreamer, Cythera sends glances        Bathed in sweetest desire--even in marble they're damp.      Thinking about his embrace and its pleasures, she seems to be asking        Shouldn't our glorious son here at our side stand erect?          XIV      Can't you hear voices, beloved, out on the Via Flamina?        Reapers are now going home, back from harvesting grain.      They had journeyed to Rome from afar, and here plaited for Ceres        Wreaths which the Romans today scorn to make for themselves.      Festivals no longer celebrate Ceres, the nourishing goddess        Who replaced acorns of old, giving man golden wheat.      Let us commemorate her then ourselves in festival private        (Two constitute a whole tribe, when they are two in love).      Have you by any chance heard how that mystical, strange celebration        Followed victorious troops back from Eleusis to Rome?      Greeks were the ones who began it, and only to Greeks they proclaimed it        Even within Roman walls: \"Come to the sanctified night.\"      Those who were not of the cult kept their distance; neophytes trembled,        Waiting in garments of white, symbol of all that is pure.      Then the initiates must aimlessly wander about through the eerie        Circles of figures as if pilgriming through their own dreams.      Snakes on the ground were writhing about. Now virgins came bearing        Caskets securely locked, richly wreathed with grain.      Surely the gestures of murmuring priests must contain some deep meaning--        Impatient acolytes wait, anxiously hoping for light.      Not until after many a testing and trial did they discover        What, within sacred ring, secretive image concealed.      What was this mystery other than this:   that Demeter, goddess,        Once upon a time had to a hero been kind.      It was to Jason, powerful king of the Cretans, she granted        Of her immortal self hidden sweet parts to explore.      That made the fortune of Crete! The marital bed of the goddess        Soon grew pregnant with grain, heavy her bounteous fields.      As for the rest of the world, it languished away, while Ceres,        Derelict of her true task, dalliance offered in love.      --Now the initiate youths, having followed this tale, all astonished,        Turned and beckoned their loves--love, do you comprehend?      See there the sacred shade beneath that bushy-boughed myrtle?        Our satisfaction will there scarcely endanger a world.          XV      Cupid is always a scoundrel, and if you believe him he'll cheat you.        Here's what the hypocrite said: \"Trust me just once more, this time.      I have the best of intentions toward you who have now dedicated--        I recognize it with thanks--life and writings to me.      Lo, I have followed you hither to Rome, and I'd like to do something        Here in this far away land pleasing to such an old friend.      Every traveller I've ever known has complained of poor treatment:        He whom I recommend treatment delicious receives.      You've now regarded with awe all the structures which lie here in ruins,        Cultivated your eye, sensing each hallowed space.      How you've revered the formative will of those ancient artists!        In their own ateliers often I 've visited them.      As for their works, why, I formed those myself--now this time I'm boasting        Not. Oh come now, admit what I am saying is true.      Where are your own creations, your service to me having slackened?        Where is invention's glow now? Where is the color all gone?      Friend, do you hope you can create again? --The school of the Ancients        Yet remains open.  Its gates, years have not closed them to you.      I am eternally young, and as teacher I still love the young ones.        Wisdom that comes with old age pleases me not. Listen here:      Wasn't antiquity young when those fortunate Ancients were living?        Happy then be your life, too: in it antiquity lives.      Where will you find a fit theme for your song? --It is I must provide it.        As for a style truly grand, love can alone give you that.\"      All of these claims that sophist asserted. Could I contradict him?        I am wont to obey, when my commander decrees.      Treacherous now he is keeping his word: giving me themes for my poems        While he is stealing my time, potency, presence of mind.      Gazing into"]]]
