[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/871"],[0,"The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, with the Hymn of Cleanthes (#2)"],[1," of yourselves, and  talking of yourselves in an abject and ignoble way: but to prevent there  being by chance among you any such young men as, after recognising their  kindred to the Gods, and their bondage in these chains of the body and  its manifold necessities, should desire to cast them off as burdens  too grievous to be borne, and depart their true kindred. This is the  struggle in which your Master and Teacher, were he worthy of the name,  should be engaged. You would come to me and say: \"Epictetus, we can no  longer endure being chained to this wretched body, giving food and  drink and rest and purification: aye, and for its sake forced to be  subservient to this man and that. Are these not things indifferent and  nothing to us? Is it not true that death is no evil? Are we not in  a manner kinsmen of the Gods, and have we not come from them? Let us  depart thither, whence we came: let us be freed from these chains that  confine and press us down. Here are thieves and robbers and tribunals:  and they that are called tyrants, who deem that they have after a  fashion power over us, because of the miserable body and what appertains  to it. Let us show them that they have power over none.\"          XVIII    And to this I reply:--    \"Friends, wait for God. When He gives the signal, and releases you from  this service, then depart to Him. But for the present, endure to dwell  in the place wherein He hath assigned you your post. Short indeed is the  time of your habitation therein, and easy to those that are minded. What  tyrant, what robber, what tribunals have any terrors for those who thus  esteem the body and all that belong to it as of no account? Stay; depart  not rashly hence!\"          XIX    Something like that is what should pass between a teacher and ingenuous  youths. As it is, what does pass? The teacher is a lifeless body, and  you are lifeless bodies yourselves. When you have had enough to eat  today, you sit down and weep about tomorrow's food. Slave! if you  have it, well and good; if not, you will depart: the door is open--why  lament? What further room is there for tears? What further occasion for  flattery? Why should one envy another? Why should you stand in awe of  them that have much or are placed in power, especially if they be also  strong and passionate? Why, what should they do to us? What they can do,  we will not regard: what does concern us, that they cannot do. Who then  shall rule one that is thus minded?          XX    Seeing this then, and noting well the faculties which you have, you  should say,--\"Send now, O God, any trial that Thou wilt; lo, I have  means and powers given me by Thee to acquit myself with honour through  whatever comes to pass!\"--No; but there you sit, trembling for fear  certain things should come to pass, and moaning and groaning and  lamenting over what does come to pass. And then you upbraid the Gods.  Such meanness of spirit can have but one result--impiety.    Yet God has not only given us these faculties by means of which we may  bear everything that comes to pass without being crushed or depressed  thereby; but like a good King and Father, He has given us this without  let or hindrance, placed wholly at our own disposition, without  reserving to Himself any power of impediment or restraint. Though  possessing all these things free and all you own, you do not use them!  you do not perceive what it is you have received nor whence it comes,  but sit moaning and groaning; some of you blind to the Giver, making no  acknowledgment to your Benefactor; others basely giving themselves to  complaints and accusations against God.    Yet what faculties and powers you possess for attaining courage and  greatness of heart, I can easily show you; what you have for upbraiding  and accusation, it is for you to show me!          XXI    How did Socrates bear himself in this regard? How else than as became  one who was fully assured that he was the kinsman of Gods?          XXII    If God had made that part of His own nature which He severed from  Himself and gave to us, liable to be hindered or constrained either by  Himself or any other, He would not have been God, nor would He have been  taking care of us as He ought . . . . If you choose, you are free; if  you choose, you need blame no man--accuse no man. All things will be at  once according to your mind and according to the Mind of God.          XXIII    Petrifaction is of two sorts. There is petrifaction of the  understanding; and also of the sense of shame. This happens when a  man obstinately refuses to acknowledge plain truths, and persists in  maintaining what is self-contradictory. Most of us dread mortification  of the body, and would spare no pains to escape anything of that kind.  But of mortification of the soul we are utterly heedless. With regard,  indeed, to the soul, if a man is in such a state as to be incapable of  following or understanding anything, I grant you we do think him in a  bad way. But mortification of the sense of shame and modesty we go so  far as to dub strength of mind!          XXIV    If we were as intent upon our business as the old fellows at Rome are  upon what interests them, we too might perhaps accomplish something.  I know a man older than I am, now Superintendent of the Corn-market at  Rome, and I remember when he passed through this place on his way back  from exile, what an account he gave me of his former life, declaring  that for the future, once home again, his only care should be to pass  his remaining years in quiet and tranquility. \"For how few years have  I left!\" he cried. \"That,\" I said, \"you will not do; but the moment the  scent of Rome is in your nostrils, you will forget it all; and if you  can but gain admission to Court, you will be glad enough to elbow your  way in, and thank God for it.\" \"Epictetus,\" he replied, \"if ever you  find me setting as much as one foot within the Court, think what you  will of me.\"    Well, as it was, what did he do? Ere ever he entered the city, he was  met by a despatch from the Emperor. He took it, and forgot the whole  of his resolutions. From that moment, he has been piling one thing upon  another. I should like to be beside him to remind him of what he said  when passing this way, and to add, How much better a prophet I am than  you!    What then? do I say man is not made for an active life? Far from it!  . . . But there is a great difference between other men's occupations and  ours. . . . A glance at theirs will make it clear to you. All day long  they do nothing but calculate, contrive, consult how to wring their  profit out of food-stuffs, farm-plots and the like. . . . Whereas, I  entreat you to learn what the administration of the World is, and what  place a Being endowed with reason holds therein: to consider what you  are yourself, and wherein your Good and Evil consists.          XXV    A man asked me to write to Rome on his behalf who, as most people  thought, had met with misfortune; for having been before wealthy and  distinguished, he had afterwards lost all and was living here. So I  wrote about him in a humble style. He however on reading the letter  returned it to me, with the words: \"I asked for your help, not for your  pity. No evil has happened unto me.\"          XXVI    True instruction is this:--to learn to wish that each thing should come  to pass as it does. And how does it come to pass? As the Disposer has  disposed it. Now He has disposed that there should be summer and winter,  and plenty and dearth, and vice and virtue, and all such opposites, for  the harmony of the whole.          XXVII    Have this thought ever present with thee, when thou losest any outward  thing, what thou gainest in its stead; and if this be the more precious,  say not, I have suffered loss.          XXVIII    Concerning the Gods, there are who deny the very existence of the  Godhead; others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns  itself nor has forethought for anything. A third party attribute to it  existence and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not  for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as  well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each  individual. A fifth, of whom were Ulysses and Socrates are those that  cry:--    I move not without Thy knowledge!          XXIX    Considering all these things, the good and true man submits his  judgement to Him that administers the Universe, even as good citizens to  the law of the State. And he that is being instructed should come thus  minded:--How may I in all things follow the Gods; and, How may I rest  satisfied with the Divine Administration; and, How may I become free?  For he is free for whom all things come to pass according to his will,  and whom none can hinder. What then, is freedom madness? God forbid. For  madness and freedom exist not together.    \"But I wish all that I desire to come to pass and in the manner that I  desire.\"    --You are mad, you are beside yourself. Know you not that Freedom is a  glorious thing and of great worth? But that what I desired at random I  should wish at random to come to pass, so far from being noble, may well  be exceeding base.          XXX    You must know that it is no easy thing for a principle to become a man's  own, unless each day he maintain it and hear it maintained, as well as  work it out in life.          XXXI    You are impatient and hard to please. If alone, you call it solitude: if  in the company of men, you dub them conspirators and thieves, and find  fault with your very parents, children, brothers, and neighbours.  Whereas when by yourself you should have called it Tranquillity and  Freedom: and herein deemed yourself like unto the Gods. And when in the  company of many, you should not have called it a wearisome crowd and  tumult, but an assembly and a tribunal; and thus accepted all with  contentment.          XXXII    What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8713"],[0,"A Man of Means (#2)"],[1," \"Yes. Times are bad just at present, so he has had to lower me to a  hundred and ten.\"    The collected jaws of the family fell as one jaw. Muriel herself seemed  to be bearing the blow with fortitude, but the rest were stunned. Frank  and Percy might have been posing for a picture of men who had lost their  fountain pens.    Beneath the table the hand of Albert Potter found the hand of Muriel  Coppin, and held it; and Muriel, we regret to add, turned and bestowed  upon Albert a half-smile of tender understanding.    \"I suppose,\" said Roland, \"we couldn't get married on a hundred and  ten?\"    \"No,\" said Percy.    \"No,\" said Frank.    \"No,\" said Albert Potter.    They all spoke decidedly, but Albert the most decidedly of the three.    \"Then,\" said Roland regretfully, \"I'm afraid we must wait.\"    It seemed to be the general verdict that they must wait. Muriel said she  thought they must wait. Albert Potter, whose opinion no one had asked,  was quite certain that they must wait. Mrs. Coppin, between sobs, moaned  that it would be best to wait. Frank and Percy, morosely devouring  bread and jam, said they supposed they would have to wait. And, to end a  painful scene, Roland drifted silently from the room, and went up-stairs  to his own quarters.    There was a telegram on the mantel.    \"Some fellows,\" he soliloquized happily, as he opened it, \"wouldn't  have been able to manage a little thing like that. They would have given  themselves away. They would----\"    The contents of the telegram demanded his attention.    For some time they conveyed nothing to him. The thing might have been  written in Hindustani.    It would have been quite appropriate if it had been, for it was from the  promoters of the Calcutta Sweep, and it informed him that, as the holder  of ticket number 108,694, he had drawn Gelatine, and in recognition of  this fact a check for five hundred pounds would be forwarded to him in  due course.           *       *       *       *       *    Roland's first feeling was one of pure bewilderment. As far as he  could recollect, he had never had any dealings whatsoever with these  open-handed gentlemen. Then memory opened her flood-gates and swept him  back to a morning ages ago, so it seemed to him, when Mr. Fineberg's  eldest son Ralph, passing through the office on his way to borrow money  from his father, had offered him for ten shillings down a piece of  cardboard, at the same time saying something about a sweep. Partly  from a vague desire to keep in with the Fineberg clan, but principally  because it struck him as rather a doggish thing to do, Roland had passed  over the ten shillings; and there, as far as he had known, the matter  had ended.    And now, after all this time, that simple action had borne fruit in the  shape of Gelatine and a check for five hundred pounds.    Roland's next emotion was triumph. The sudden entry of checks for five  hundred pounds into a man's life is apt to produce this result.    For the space of some minutes he gloated; and then reaction set in. Five  hundred pounds meant marriage with Muriel.    His brain worked quickly. He must conceal this thing. With trembling  fingers he felt for his match-box, struck a match, and burnt the  telegram to ashes. Then, feeling a little better, he sat down to think  the whole matter over. His meditations brought a certain amount of balm.  After all, he felt, the thing could quite easily be kept a secret. He  would receive the check in due course, as stated, and he would bicycle  over to the neighboring town of Lexingham and start a bank-account with  it. Nobody would know, and life would go on as before.    He went to bed, and slept peacefully.           *       *       *       *       *    It was about a week after this that he was roused out of a deep sleep  at eight o'clock in the morning to find his room full of Coppins. Mr.  Coppin was there in a nightshirt and his official trousers. Mrs.  Coppin was there, weeping softly in a brown dressing-gown. Modesty had  apparently kept Muriel from the gathering, but brothers Frank and Percy  stood at his bedside, shaking him by the shoulders and shouting. Mr.  Coppin thrust a newspaper at him, as he sat up blinking.    These epic moments are best related swiftly. Roland took the paper, and  the first thing that met his sleepy eye and effectually drove the sleep  from it was this head-line:       ROMANCE OF THE CALCUTTA SWEEPSTAKES    And beneath it another in type almost as large as the first:       POOR CLERK WINS L40,000    His own name leaped at him from the printed page, and with it that of  the faithful Gelatine.    Flight! That was the master-word which rang in Roland's brain as day  followed day. The wild desire of the trapped animal to be anywhere  except just where he was had come upon him. He was past the stage when  conscience could have kept him to his obligations. He had ceased to  think of anything or any one but himself. All he asked of Fate was to  remove him from Bury St. Edwards on any terms.    It may be that some inkling of his state of mind was wafted  telepathically to Frank and Percy, for it can not be denied that their  behavior at this juncture was more than a little reminiscent of the  police force. Perhaps it was simply their natural anxiety to keep an eye  on what they already considered their own private gold-mine that made  them so adhesive. Certainly there was no hour of the day when one or the  other was not in Roland's immediate neighborhood. Their vigilance  even extended to the night hours, and once, when Roland, having tossed  sleeplessly on his bed, got up at two in the morning, with the wild idea  of stealing out of the house and walking to London, a door opened as he  reached the top of the stairs, and a voice asked him what he thought he  was doing. The statement that he was walking in his sleep was accepted,  but coldly.    It was shortly after this that, having by dint of extraordinary strategy  eluded the brothers and reached the railway-station, Roland, with his  ticket to London in his pocket and the express already entering the  station, was engaged in conversation by old Mr. Coppin, who appeared  from nowhere to denounce the high cost of living in a speech that lasted  until the tail-lights of the train had vanished and Brothers Frank and  Percy arrived, panting.    A man has only a certain capacity for battling with Fate. After this  last episode Roland gave in. Not even the exquisite agony of hearing  himself described in church as a bachelor of this parish, with the grim  addition that this was for the second time of asking, could stir him to  a fresh dash for liberty.    Altho the shadow of the future occupied Roland's mind almost to the  exclusion of everything else, he was still capable of suffering a  certain amount of additional torment from the present; and one of the  things which made the present a source of misery to him was the fact  that he was expected to behave more like a mad millionaire than a sober  young man with a knowledge of the value of money. His mind, trained from  infancy to a decent respect for the pence, had not yet adjusted itself  to the possession of large means; and the open-handed role forced upon  him by the family appalled him.    When the Coppins wanted anything, they asked for it; and it seemed to  Roland that they wanted pretty nearly everything. If Mr. Coppin had  reached his present age without the assistance of a gold watch, he might  surely have struggled along to the end on gun-metal. In any case, a man  of his years should have been thinking of higher things than mere gauds  and trinkets. A like criticism applied to Mrs. Coppin's demand for a  silk petticoat, which struck Roland as simply indecent. Frank and Percy  took theirs mostly in specie. It was Muriel who struck the worst blow by  insisting on a hired motor-car.    Roland hated motor-cars, especially when they were driven by Albert  Potter, as this one was. Albert, that strong, silent man, had but one  way of expressing his emotions, namely to open the throttle and shave  the paint off trolley-cars. Disappointed love was giving Albert a good  deal of discomfort at this time, and he found it made him feel better  to go round corners on two wheels. As Muriel sat next to him on these  expeditions, Roland squashing into the tonneau with Frank and Percy, his  torments were subtle. He was not given a chance to forget, and the only  way in which he could obtain a momentary diminution of the agony was to  increase the speed to sixty miles an hour.    It was in this fashion that they journeyed to the neighboring town of  Lexingham to see M. Etienne Feriaud perform his feat of looping the loop  in his aeroplane.    It was Brother Frank's idea that they should make up a party to go and  see M. Feriaud. Frank's was one of those generous, unspoiled natures  which never grow _blase_ at the sight of a fellow human taking a  sporting chance at hara-kiri. He was a well-known figure at every wild  animal exhibition within a radius of fifty miles, and M. Feriaud drew  him like a magnet.    \"The blighter goes up,\" he explained, as he conducted the party into the  arena, \"and then he stands on his head and goes round in circles. I've  seen pictures of it.\"    It appeared that M. Feriaud did even more than this. Posters round the  ground advertised the fact that, on receipt of five pounds, he would  take up a passenger with him. To date, however, there appeared to have  been no rush on the part of the canny inhabitants of Lexingham to avail  themselves of this chance of a breath of fresh air. M. Feriaud, a small  man with a chubby and amiable face, wandered about signing picture cards  and smoking a lighted cigaret, looking a little disappointed.    Albert Potter was scornful.    \"Lot of rabbits,\" he said. \"Where's their pluck? And I suppose they call  themselves Englishmen. I'd go up precious quick if I had a five-pound  note. Disgrace, I call it,"]]]
