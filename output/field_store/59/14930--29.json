[Illustration: Fig. 2]    Every ingot, when cast, contains within itself a considerably larger  store of heat than is necessary for the rolling operation. Some of this  heat is, of course, lost by passing into the mould, some is lost by  radiation before the ingot enters into the soaking pit, and some is lost  after it enters, by being conducted away by the brickwork; but in the  ordinary course of working, when there is no undue loss of time in  transferring the ingots, after allowing for this loss, there remains a  surplus, which goes into the brickwork of the soaking pits, so that this  surplus of heat from successive ingots tends continually to keep the  pits at the intense heat of the ingot itself. Thus, occasionally it  happens that inadvertently an ingot is delayed so long on its way to the  pit as to arrive there somewhat short of heat, its temperature will be  raised by heat from the walls of the pit itself; the refractory mass  wherein the pit is formed, in fact, acting as an accumulator of heat,  giving and taking heat as required to carry on the operation in a  continuous and practical manner.    [Illustration: GJERS' SOAKING PITS FOR STEEL INGOTS.]    During the soaking operation a quantity of gas exudes from the ingot and  fills the pit, thus entirely excluding atmospheric air from entering;  this is seen escaping round the lid, and when the lid is removed  combustion takes place.    It will be seen by analyses given hereinafter that this gas is entirely  composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide, so that the ingots  soak in a perfectly non-oxidizing medium. Hence loss of steel by  oxidation does not take place, and consequently the great loss of  yield which always occurs in the ordinary heating furnace is entirely  obviated.    The author does not think it necessary to dilate upon the economical  advantages of his process, as they are apparent to every practical man  connected with the manufacture of steel.    The operation of steel making on a large scale will by this process be  very much simplified. It will help to dispense with a large number of  men, some of them highly paid, directly and indirectly connected with  the heating department; it will do away with costly heating furnaces and  gas generators, and their costly maintenance; it will save all the coal  used in heating; and what is perhaps of still more importance, it will  save the loss in yield of steel; and there will be no more steel spoiled  by overheating in the furnaces.    The process has been in operation too short a time to give precise  and reliable figures, but it is hoped that by the next meeting of the  Institute these will be forthcoming from various quarters.    Referring to the illustrations annexed, Fig. 1 shows sectional  elevation, and Fig. 2 plan of a set of eight soaking pits (marked  A). These pits are built in a mass of brickwork, B, on a concrete  foundation, C; the ingots, D, standing upright in the pits. The pits are  lined with firebrick lumps, 6 in. thick, forming an independent lining,  E, which at any time can be readily renewed. F is a cast iron plate,  made to take in four pits, and dropped loosely within the large plate,  G, which surrounds the pits. H is the cover, with a firebrick lining;  and I is a false cover of firebrick, 1 in. smaller than the cross  section of the pit, put in to rest on the top of the ingot. This false  cover need not necessarily be used, but is useful to keep the extreme  top of the ingot extra hot. J is the bottom of the pit, composed of  broken brick and silver sand, forming a good hard bottom at any desired  level.    Figs. 4 and 5 show outline plan of two sets of soaking pits, K K, eight  each, placed under a 25 ft. sweep crane, L. This crane, if a good one,  could handle any ordinary make--up to 2,000 tons per week, and ought to  have hydraulic racking out and swinging round gear. This crane places  the ingots into the pits, and, when they are ready, picks them out and  swings them round to blooming mill, M. With such a crane, four men and a  boy at the handles are able to pass the whole of that make through the  pits. The author recommends two sets of pits as shown, although one set  of eight pits is quite able to deal with any ordinary output from one  Bessemer pit.    In case of an extraordinarily large output, the author recommends a  second crane, F, for the purpose of placing the ingots in the pits  only, the crane, L, being entirely used for picking the ingots out  and swinging them round to the live rollers of the mill. The relative  position of the cranes, soaking pits, and blooming mill may of course be  variously arranged according to circumstances, and the soaking pits may  be arranged in single or more rows, or concentrically with the crane at  pleasure.    Figs. 4 and 5 also show outline plan and elevation of a Bessemer plant,  conveniently arranged for working on the soaking pit system. A A are  the converters, with a transfer crane, B. C is the casting pit with  its crane, D. E E are the two ingot cranes. F is a leading crane which  transfers the ingots from the ingot cranes to the soaking pits, K K,  commanded by the crane, L, which transfers the prepared ingots to the  mill, M. as before described.           *       *       *       *       *          TEMPERING BY COMPRESSION.      L. Clemandot has devised a new method of treating metals, especially  steel, which consists in heating to a cherry red, compressing strongly  and keeping up the pressure until the metal is completely cooled. The  results are so much like those of tempering that he calls his process  tempering by compression. The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard,  acquiring a molecular contraction and a fineness of grain such that  polishing gives it the appearance of polished nickel. Compressed steel,  like tempered steel, acquires the coercitive force which enables it to  absorb magnetism. This property should be studied in connection with  its durability; experiments have already shown that there is no loss of  magnetism at the expiration of three months. This compression has no  analogue but tempering. Hammering and hardening modify the molecular  state of metals, especially when they are practiced upon metal that is  nearly cold, but the effect of hydraulic pressure is much greater.  The phenomena which are produced in both methods of tempering may be  interpreted in different ways, but it seems likely that there is a  molecular approximation, an amorphism from which results the homogeneity  that is due to the absence of crystallization. Being an operation which  can be measured, it may be graduated and kept within limits which are  prescribed in advance; directions may be given to temper at a  specified pressure, as readily as to work under a given pressure of  steam.--_Chron. Industr_.           *       *       *       *       *          ECONOMICAL STEAM POWER.    [Footnote: A paper read by title at a recent stated meeting of the  Franklin Institute]    By WILLIAM BARNET LE VAN.      The most economical application of steam power can be realized only by  a judicious arrangement of the plant: namely, the engines, boilers, and  their accessories for transmission.    This may appear a somewhat broad assertion; but it is nevertheless one  which is amply justified by facts open to the consideration of all those  who choose to seek for them.    While it is true that occasionally a factory, mill, or a water-works  may be found in which the whole arrangements have been planned by a  competent engineer, yet such is the exception and not the rule, and such  examples form but a very small percentage of the whole.    The fact is that but few users of steam power are aware of the numerous  items which compose the cost of economical steam power, while a yet  smaller number give sufficient consideration to the relations which  these items bear to each other, or the manner in which the economy of  any given boiler or engine is affected by the circumstances under which  it is run.    A large number of persons--and they are those who should know better,  too--take for granted that a boiler or engine which is good for one  situation is good for all; a greater error than such an assumption can  scarcely be imagined.    It is true that there are certain classes of engines and boilers which  may be relied upon to give moderately good results in almost any  situation--and the best results should _always_ be desired in  arrangement of a mill--there are a considerable number of details which  must be taken into consideration in making a choice of boilers and  engines.    Take the case of a mill in which it has been supposed that the motive  power could be best exerted by a single engine. The question now is  whether or not it would be best to divide the total power required among  a number of engines.    _First_.--A division of the motive power presents the following  advantages, namely, a saving of expense on lines of shafting of large  diameter.    _Second_.--Dispensing with the large driving belt or gearing, the first  named of which, in one instance under the writer's observation, absorbed  _sixty horse-power_ out of about 480, or about _seven per cent_.    _Third_.--The general convenience of subdividing the work to be done,  so that in case of a stoppage of one portion of the work by reason of  a loose coupling or the changing of a pulley, etc., that portion only  would need to be stopped.    This last is of itself a most important point, and demands careful  consideration.    For example, I was at a mill a short time ago when the governor belt  broke. The result was a stoppage of the whole mill.

He describes it as far less fertile than the cultivated  parts of Europe and Asia, and much exposed to drought, with the exception  of a few verdant spots. To the northern coast, he gives the name of the  forehead of Africa; and says that immediately south from it, the  comparative fertility of the soil rapidly decreases. There are natural  hills of salt, out of which the inhabitants scoop houses to shelter  themselves from the weather; rain they have not to fear, as scarcely a  drop ever alights upon that sultry region. Farther south still, there is  no food to support man or beast--neither shrub, nor a single drop of  water; all is silence and utter desolation. Herodotus then proceeds to  relate a number of monstrous fables, which bear an overwhelming  proportion to the parts of his narrative which are now known to be true.  He also describes a large inland river, which some have supposed to be  the Niger, flowing from west to east. He acquired this information from  the reports of various travellers, who stated that after a long journey  to the interior, they had themselves seen it. This account was confirmed  by several other ancient authors; but for a long time the question was  agitated by modern writers as to whether the Gambia or the Senegal was  not the river spoken of; some even denying the existence of the Niger  altogether.    The fables of Herodotus were repeated, with a number of additions, by  Diodorus; but the narrative of Strabo, in regard to the northern and  western coasts, is somewhat more particular and authentic: it adds  nothing, however, to our acquaintance with the interior. The Greeks,  under the government of the Ptolemies, navigated the Red Sea, and carried  on a trade with Egypt; and some settlements were made by them in that  country. Ptolemy Euergetes conquered part of Abyssinia, and established a  kingdom, of which Axum was the metropolis; and remains of Grecian  architecture have since been found in that quarter. To the two districts  we have mentioned, the knowledge which the ancients possessed of Africa  was almost exclusively confined; though Herodotus speaks of two voyages  which had been undertaken with a view to determine the shape of the  continent; but as nothing interesting can be gleaned from his indistinct  narrative, and as the reality even of these voyages has been disputed, it  seems unnecessary to give any account of them.    As in this brief sketch we are to confine ourselves entirely to  discoveries made in the interior of Africa, we shall not mention either  the various voyages made along the shores, or the different settlements  formed upon the coast, as this would lead us far beyond our narrow  limits.    The Arabians were the first who introduced the camel into Africa, an  animal whose strength and swiftness peculiarly suited it for traversing  the immense expanse of burning sands. By means of caravans, the Arabians  were enabled to hold intercourse with the interior, whence they procured  supplies of gold and slaves; and many of them migrated to the south of  the Great Desert. Their number rapidly increased, and being skilled in  the art of war, they soon became the ruling power. They founded several  kingdoms; the principal one, called Gano, soon became the greatest market  for gold, and, under the name of Kano, is still extensive and populous,  being the chief commercial place in the interior of Africa. The Arabian  writers of the twelfth century, give the most gorgeous, and we fear  overrated, accounts of the flourishing state of these kingdoms.    In the fourteenth century, Ibn Batuta, an abridged account of whose  travels has been recently translated by Professor Lee of Cambridge, made  a journey into Central Africa. After having travelled twenty-five days  with a caravan, he came to a place which Major Rennel supposes to be the  modern Tisheet, containing the mine whence Timbuctoo is supplied with  salt. The houses he describes as built of slabs of salt, roofed with  camels' hides. After other twenty days he reached Tashila, three days'  journey from which he entered a dreary desert, where was neither  sustenance nor water, but only plains and hills of sand. Ten days brought  him to Abu Latin, a large commercial town much frequented by merchants.  This place Mr."]]]
