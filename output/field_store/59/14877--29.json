Oh, he had  them--and he just settled his grip and squeezed them.  They were  laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock  to him at 15 and 16 and along there that wasn't worth 10.  Well,  when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths,  they rested-up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side.  That was when they compromised with the Invincible at 283!\"    \"Good land!\"    \"He skinned them alive, and they deserved it--anyway, the whole  kingdom rejoiced.  Well, among the flayed were Sir Agravaine and  Sir Mordred, nephews to the king.  End of the first act.  Act  second, scene first, an apartment in Carlisle castle, where the  court had gone for a few days' hunting.  Persons present, the  whole tribe of the king's nephews.  Mordred and Agravaine propose  to call the guileless Arthur's attention to Guenever and Sir  Launcelot.  Sir Gawaine, Sir Gareth, and Sir Gaheris will have  nothing to do with it.  A dispute ensues, with loud talk; in the  midst of it enter the king.  Mordred and Agravaine spring their  devastating tale upon him.  _Tableau_.  A trap is laid for Launcelot,  by the king's command, and Sir Launcelot walks into it.  He made  it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses--to wit,  Mordred, Agravaine, and twelve knights of lesser rank, for he  killed every one of them but Mordred; but of course that couldn't  straighten matters between Launcelot and the king, and didn't.\"    \"Oh, dear, only one thing could result--I see that.  War, and  the knights of the realm divided into a king's party and a  Sir Launcelot's party.\"    \"Yes--that was the way of it.  The king sent the queen to the  stake, proposing to purify her with fire.  Launcelot and his  knights rescued her, and in doing it slew certain good old friends  of yours and mine--in fact, some of the best we ever had; to wit,  Sir Belias le Orgulous, Sir Segwarides, Sir Griflet le Fils de Dieu,  Sir Brandiles, Sir Aglovale--\"    \"Oh, you tear out my heartstrings.\"    \"--wait, I'm not done yet--Sir Tor, Sir Gauter, Sir Gillimer--\"    \"The very best man in my subordinate nine.  What a handy right-fielder  he was!\"    \"--Sir Reynold's three brothers, Sir Damus, Sir Priamus, Sir Kay  the Stranger--\"    \"My peerless short-stop!  I've seen him catch a daisy-cutter in  his teeth.  Come, I can't stand this!\"    \"--Sir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Herminde, Sir Pertilope,  Sir Perimones, and--whom do you think?\"    \"Rush!  Go on.\"    \"Sir Gaheris, and Sir Gareth--both!\"    \"Oh, incredible!  Their love for Launcelot was indestructible.\"    \"Well, it was an accident.  They were simply onlookers; they were  unarmed, and were merely there to witness the queen's punishment.  Sir Launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury,  and he killed these without noticing who they were.  Here is an  instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle; it's  for sale on every news-stand.  There--the figures nearest the queen  are Sir Launcelot with his sword up, and Sir Gareth gasping his  latest breath.  You can catch the agony in the queen's face through  the curling smoke.  It's a rattling battle-picture.\"    \"Indeed, it is.  We must take good care of it; its historical value  is incalculable.  Go on.\"    \"Well, the rest of the tale is just war, pure and simple.  Launcelot  retreated to his town and castle of Joyous Gard, and gathered  there a great following of knights.  The king, with a great host,  went there, and there was desperate fighting during several days,  and, as a result, all the plain around was paved with corpses  and cast-iron.  Then the Church patched up a peace between Arthur  and Launcelot and the queen and everybody--everybody but Sir Gawaine.  He was bitter about the slaying of his brothers, Gareth and Gaheris,  and would not be appeased.  He notified Launcelot to get him  thence, and make swift preparation, and look to be soon attacked.  So Launcelot sailed to his Duchy of Guienne with his following, and  Gawaine soon followed with an army, and he beguiled Arthur to go  with him.  Arthur left the kingdom in Sir Mordred's hands until  you should return--\"    \"Ah--a king's customary wisdom!\"    \"Yes.  Sir Mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship  permanent.  He was going to marry Guenever, as a first move; but  she fled and shut herself up in the Tower of London.  Mordred  attacked; the Bishop of Canterbury dropped down on him with the  Interdict.  The king returned; Mordred fought him at Dover, at  Canterbury, and again at Barham Down.  Then there was talk of peace  and a composition.  Terms, Mordred to have Cornwall and Kent during  Arthur's life, and the whole kingdom afterward.\"    \"Well, upon my word!  My dream of a republic to _be_ a dream, and  so remain.\"    \"Yes.  The two armies lay near Salisbury.  Gawaine--Gawaine's head  is at Dover Castle, he fell in the fight there--Gawaine appeared to  Arthur in a dream, at least his ghost did, and warned him to  refrain from conflict for a month, let the delay cost what it might.  But battle was precipitated by an accident.  Arthur had given  order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over  the proposed treaty with Mordred, sound the trumpet and fall on!  for he had no confidence in Mordred.  Mordred had given a similar  order to _his_ people.  Well, by and by an adder bit a knight's heel;  the knight forgot all about the order, and made a slash at the  adder with his sword.  Inside of half a minute those two prodigious  hosts came together with a crash!  They butchered away all day.  Then the king--however, we have started something fresh since  you left--our paper has.\"    \"No?  What is that?\"    \"War correspondence!\"    \"Why, that's good.\"    \"Yes, the paper was booming right along, for the Interdict made  no impression, got no grip, while the war lasted.  I had war  correspondents with both armies.  I will finish that battle by  reading you what one of the boys says:       'Then the king looked about him, and then was he     ware of all his host and of all his good knights     were left no more on live but two knights, that     was Sir Lucan de Butlere, and his brother Sir     Bedivere: and they were full sore wounded.  Jesu     mercy, said the king, where are all my noble     knights becomen?  Alas that ever I should see this     doleful day.  For now, said Arthur, I am come to     mine end.  But would to God that I wist where were     that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all     this mischief.  Then was King Arthur ware where Sir     Mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap     of dead men.  Now give me my spear, said Arthur     unto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the     traitor that all this woe hath wrought.  Sir, let     him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and if     ye pass this unhappy day, ye shall be right well     revenged upon him.  Good lord, remember ye of your     night's dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine     told you this night, yet God of his great goodness     hath preserved you hitherto.  Therefore, for God's     sake, my lord, leave off by this. For blessed be     God ye have won the field: for here we be three     on live, and with Sir Mordred is none on live.     And if ye leave off now, this wicked day of     destiny is past.  Tide me death, betide me life,     saith the king, now I see him yonder alone, he     shall never escape mine hands, for at a better     avail shall I never have him.  God speed you well,     said Sir Bedivere.  Then the king gat his spear     in both his hands, and ran toward Sir Mordred     crying, Traitor, now is thy death day come.  And     when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until     him with his sword drawn in his hand.  And then     King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield,     with a foin of his spear throughout the body more     than a fathom.  And when Sir Mordred felt that he     had his death's wound, he thrust himself, with     the might that he had, up to the butt of King     Arthur's spear.  And right so he smote his father     Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands,     on the side of the head, that the sword pierced     the helmet and the brain-pan, and therewithal     Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth.  And     the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth,     and there he swooned oft-times--'\"    \"That is a good piece of war correspondence, Clarence; you are  a first-rate newspaper man.  Well--is the king all right?  Did  he get well?\"    \"Poor soul, no.  He is dead.\"    I was utterly stunned; it had not seemed to me that any wound  could be mortal to him.    \"And the queen, Clarence?\"    \"She is a nun, in Almesbury.\"    \"What changes! and in such a short while.  It is inconceivable.  What next, I wonder?\"    \"I can tell you what next.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Stake our lives and stand by them!\"    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"The Church is master now.  The Interdict included you with Mordred;  it is not to be removed while you remain alive.  The clans are  gathering.

The Indians, who know little of the use of fire-arms, attack  the crocodile with lances, after the animal has been caught with large  pointed iron hooks, baited with pieces of meat, and fastened by a  chain to the trunk of a tree. They do not approach the animal till it  has struggled a long time to disengage itself from the iron fixed in  the upper jaw. There is little probability that a country in which a  labyrinth of rivers without number brings every day new bands of  crocodiles from the eastern back of the Andes, by the Meta and the  Apure, toward the coast of Spanish Guiana, should ever be delivered  from these reptiles. All that will be gained by civilization will be  to render them more timid and more easily put to flight.    Affecting instances are related of African slaves, who have exposed  their lives to save those of their masters, who had fallen into the  jaws of a crocodile. A few years ago, between Uritucu and the Mission  de Abaxo, a negro, hearing the cries of his master, flew to the spot,  armed with a long knife (machete), and plunged into the river. He  forced the crocodile, by putting out his eyes, to let go his prey and  to plunge under the water. The slave bore his expiring master to the  shore; but all succour was unavailing to restore him to life. He had  died of suffocation, for his wounds were not deep. The crocodile, like  the dog, appears not to close its jaws firmly while swimming.    The inhabitants of the banks of the Orinoco and its tributary streams  discourse continually on the dangers to which they are exposed. They  have marked the manners of the crocodile, as the torero has studied  the manners of the bull. When they are assailed, they put in practice,  with that presence of mind and that resignation which characterize the  Indians, the Zamboes, and copper-coloured men in general, the counsels  they have heard from their infancy. In countries where nature is so  powerful and so terrible, man is constantly prepared for danger. We  have mentioned before the answer of the young Indian girl, who  delivered herself from the jaws of the crocodile: \"I knew he would let  me go if I thrust my fingers into his eyes.\" This girl belonged to the  indigent class of the people, in whom the habits of physical want  augment energy of character; but how can we avoid being surprised to  observe in the countries convulsed by terrible earthquakes, on the  table-land of the province of Quito, women belonging to the highest  classes of society display in the moment of peril, the same calm, the  same reflecting intrepidity? I shall mention one example only in  support of this assertion. On the 4th of February, 1797, when 35,000  Indians perished in the space of a few minutes, a young mother saved  herself and her children, crying out to them to extend their arms at  the moment when the cracked ground was ready to swallow them up. When  this courageous woman heard the astonishment that was expressed at a  presence of mind so extraordinary, she answered, with great  simplicity, \"I had been told in my infancy: if the earthquake surprise  you in a house, place yourself under a doorway that communicates from  one apartment to another; if you be in the open air and feel the  ground opening beneath you, extend both your arms, and try to support  yourself on the edge of the crevice.\" Thus, in savage regions or in  countries exposed to frequent convulsions, man is prepared to struggle  with the beasts of the forest, to deliver himself from the jaws of the  crocodile, and to escape from the conflict of the elements.    The town of Angostura, in the early years of its foundation, had no  direct communication with the mother-country. The inhabitants were  contented with carrying on a trifling contraband trade in dried meat  and tobacco with the West India Islands, and with the Dutch colony of  Essequibo, by the Rio Carony. Neither wine, oil, nor flour, three  articles of importation the most sought after, was received directly  from Spain. Some merchants, in 1771, sent the first schooner to Cadiz;  and since that period a direct exchange of commodities with the ports  of Andalusia and Catalonia has become extremely active. The population  of Angostura,* after having been a long time languishing, has much  increased since 1785. (* Angostura, or Santo Thome de la Nueva  Guayana, in 1768, had only 500 inhabitants. Caulin page 63. They were  numbered in 1780 and the result was 1513 (455 Whites, 449 Blacks, 363  Mulattoes and Zamboes, and 246 Indians). The population in the year  1789 rose to 4590; and in 1800 to 6600 souls. Official Lists  manuscript. The capital of the English colony of Demerara, the town of  Stabroek, the name of which is scarcely known in Europe, is only fifty  leagues distant, south-east of the mouths of the Orinoco. It contains,  according to Bolingbroke, nearly 10,000 inhabitants.) At the time of  my abode in Guiana, however, it was far from being equal to that of  Stabroek, the nearest English town. The mouths of the Orinoco have an  advantage over every other part in Terra Firma. They afford the most  prompt communications with the Peninsula. The voyage from Cadiz to  Punta Barima is performed sometimes in eighteen or twenty days. The  return to Europe takes from thirty to thirty-five days. These mouths  being placed to windward of all the islands, the vessels of Angostura  can maintain a more advantageous commerce with the West Indies than La  Guayra and Porto Cabello. The merchants of Caracas, therefore, have  been always jealous of the progress of industry in Spanish Guiana; and  Caracas having been hitherto the seat of the supreme government, the  port of Angostura has been treated with still less favour than the  ports of Cumana and Nueva Barcelona. With respect to the inland trade,  the most active is that of the province of Varinas, which sends mules,  cacao, indigo, cotton, and sugar to Angostura; and in return receives  generos, that is, the products of the manufacturing industry of  Europe. I have seen long boats (lanchas) set off, the cargoes of which  were valued at eight or ten thousand piastres. These boats went first  up the Orinoco to Cabruta; then along the Apure to San Vicente; and  finally, on the Rio Santo Domingo, as far as Torunos, which is the  port of Varinas Nuevas. The little town of San Fernando de Apure, of  which I have already given a description, is the magazine of this  river-trade, which might become more considerable by the introduction  of steamboats.    I have now described the country through which we passed during a  voyage of five hundred leagues; it remains for me to make known the  small space of three degrees fifty-two minutes of longitude, that  separates the present capital from the mouth of the Orinoco. Exact  knowledge of the delta and the course of the Rio Carony is at once  interesting to hydrography and to European commerce.    When a vessel coming from sea would enter the principal mouth of the  Orinoco, the Boca de Navios, it should make the land at the Punta  Barima. The right or southern bank is the highest: the granitic rock  pierces the marshy soil at a small distance in the interior, between  the Cano Barima, the Aquire, and the Cuyuni. The left, or northern  bank of the Orinoco, which stretches along the delta towards the Boca  de Mariusas and the Punta Baxa, is very low, and is distinguishable at  a distance only by the clumps of moriche palm-trees which embellish  the passage. This is the sago-tree* of the country (* The nutritious  fecula or medullary flour of the sago-trees is found principally in a  group of palms which M. Kunth has distinguished by the name of  calameae. It is collected, however, in the Indian Archipelago, as an  article of trade, from the trunks of the Cycas revoluta, the Phoenix  farinifera, the Corypha umbraculifera, and the Caryota urens.  (Ainslie, Materia Medica of Hindostan, Madras 1813.)) The quantity of  nutritious matter which the real sago-tree of Asia affords (Sagus  Rumphii, or Metroxylon sagu, Roxb.) exceeds that which is furnished by  any other plant useful to man. One trunk of a tree in its fifteenth  year sometimes yields six hundred pounds weight of sago, or meal (for  the word sago signifies meal in the dialect of Amboyna). Mr. Crawfurd,  who resided a long time in the Indian Archipelago, calculates that an  English acre could contain four hundred and thirty-five sago-trees,  which would yield one hundred and twenty thousand five hundred pounds  avoirdupois of fecula, or more than eight thousand pounds yearly.  History of the Indian Archipelago volume 1 pages 387 and 393. This  produce is triple that of corn, and double that of potatoes in France.  But the plantain produces, on the same surface of land, still more  alimentary substance than the sago-tree.); it yields the flour of  which the yuruma bread is made; and far from being a palm-tree of the  shore, like the Chamaerops humilis, the common cocoa-tree, and the  lodoicea of Commerson, is found as a palm-tree of the marshes as far  as the sources of the Orinoco.* (* I dwell much on these divisions of  the great and fine families of palms according to the distribution of  the species: first, in dry places, or inland plains, Corypha tectorum;  second, on the sea-coast, Chamaerops humilis, Cocos nucifera, Corypha  maritima, Lodoicea seychellarum, Labill.; third, in the fresh-water  marshes, Sagus Rumphii, Mauritia flexuosa; and 4th, in the alpine  regions, between seven and fifteen hundred toises high, Ceroxylon  andicola, Oreodoxa frigida, Kunthia montana. This last group of palmae  montanae, which rises in the Andes of Guanacas nearly to the limit of  perpetual snow, was, I believe, entirely unknown before our travels in  America. (Nov.
