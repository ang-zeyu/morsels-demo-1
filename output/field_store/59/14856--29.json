This was the compelling reason that made me ultimately  accept his proposal to become a Secret Agent of Germany.  No doubt, if  the Count had lived, I would have gained my ends through his guidance  and influence, but he was killed in a riding race, three years after  our meeting in the Veldt, and I lost my best friend.  By that time I  was too deep in the Secret Service to pull out, although it was my  intention more than once to do so.  And certain promises regarding my  restoration in our house were never kept.    Coming to a partial understanding with Count Reitzenstein, I began to  work in his interests.  The Boer War taught Germany many things about  the English army and a few of these I contributed.  As a physician I  was allowed to go most anywhere and no questions asked.  I began to  collect little inside scraps of information regarding the discipline,  spirit and equipment of the British troops.  I observed that many  Colonial officers were outspoken in their criticisms.  All these  points I reported in full to Count Reitzenstein when I dressed his  wound.  One day he said:    \"Don't forget now.  After the war, I want to see you in Berlin.\"    In my subsequent eagerness to pump more details from the Colonial  officers, I too criticised, and one day I was told Lord Kitchener  wanted to see me.    \"Doctor,\" he said curtly, when I was ushered into his tent, \"you have  twenty-four hours in which to leave camp--\"    Whether that mandate was a result of my joining in with the Colonial  officers' criticism, or because my secret activity for Count  Reitzenstein had been suspected, I cannot say.  But knowing the ways  of the \"man of Khartoum,\" I made haste to be out of camp within the  time prescribed.    Later I learned that the Count, being convalescent and paroled, was  sent down to Cape Town.  After the occupation of Pretoria, I got tired  of roughing it and made my way back to Europe, finally locating in  Berlin for a prolonged stay.  I knew Berlin, and had a fondness for  it, having spent part of my youth there in the course of my education.  It has always been a habit of mine not to seem anxious about anything,  so I spent several weeks idling around Berlin before looking up Count  Reitzenstein.  One day I called at his residence, Thiergartenstrasse  23.  I found the Count on the point of leaving for the races at  Hoppegarten.  He was one of the crack sportsmen of Prussia and never  missed a meeting.  He suggested that I go to the track with him, and  while we waited for the servant to bring around his turn-out, he  renewed his proposals about my entering Prussian service.    \"I expected you long ago,\" he said.  \"I have smoothed your way to a  great extent.  We are likely to meet one or two of the Service Chiefs  out at the track, this afternoon.  If you like, I'll introduce you to  them.\"    \"Is there any likelihood of my being recognized?\" I asked.  \"You know,  Count, it will be impossible for me to go under my true flag.\"    He assured me there was not the slightest chance.    \"Your identity,\" he explained, \"need be known to but one person.\"    Later I w as to know who this important personage was.    \" Very well,\" I agreed; \"we'll try it.\"    The Count always drove his own turn-out, and invited me to climb up on  the box.  When his attention was not occupied with his reins and  returning the salutes of passers-by, for he was one of the most  popular men in Berlin, we discussed my private affairs.  The Count  showed a keen interest and sympathy in them and his proposal began to  take favorable shape in my mind.  As he predicted, we met some of the  Service Chiefs at the track.  Indeed, almost the first persons who  saluted him in the saddle paddock were Captain Zur See von Tappken and  a gentleman who was introduced to me as Herr von Riechter.  The Count  introduced me as Dr. von Graver, which I subsequently altered whenever  the occasion arose to the English Graves.  After chatting a bit,  Captain von Tappken made an appointment with me at his bureau in the  Koenigergratzerstrasse 70, the headquarters of the Intelligence  Department of the Imperial Navy in Berlin, but macle no further  reference to the subject that afternoon.  I noticed though that Herr  von Riechter put some pointed and leading questions to me, regarding  my travels, linguistic attainments, and general knowledge.  He must  have been satisfied, for I saw some significant glances pass between  him and the Captain.  The repeated exclamations of \"Grossartig!\" and  \"Colossal!\" seemed to express his entire satisfaction.    Following my usual bent, I did not call at Koenigergratzerstrasse 70  as the Captain suggested.  About three days passed and then I received  a very courteously worded letter requesting me to call at my earliest  convenience at his quarters as he had something of importance to tell  me.  I called.    Koenigergratzerstrasse 70 is a typical Prussian building of  administration.  Solid but unpretentious, it is the very embodiment of  Prussian efficiency, and like all official buildings in Germany is  well guarded.  The doorkeeper and commissaire, a taciturn  non-commissioned officer, takes your name and whom you wish to see.  He enters these later in a book, then telephones to the person  required and you are either ushered up or denied admittance.  When  sent up, you are invariably accompanied by an orderly--it does not  matter how well you are known--who does not leave you until the door  has closed behind you.  When you leave, there is the same procedure  and the very duration of your visit is entered and checked in the  doorkeeper's book.    I was admitted immediately.  After passing through three anterooms  containing private secretaries not in uniform, I was shown into  Captain von Tappken's private office.  He wore the undress ranking  uniform of the Imperial Navy.  This is significant, for it is  characteristic of all the branches of the Prussian Service to find  officers in charge.  The secretaries and men of all work, however, are  civilians; this for a reason.  The heads of all departments are German  officers, recruited from the old feudal aristocracy, loyal to a degree  to the throne.  They find it incompatible, notwithstanding their  loyalty, to soil their hands with some of the work connected with all  government duties, especially those of the Secret Service.  Though  planning the work, they never execute it.  To be sure, there are  ex-officers connected with the Secret Service, men like von Zenden,  formerly an officer of the Zweiter Garde Dragoner, but with some few  exceptions they are usually men who have gone to smash.  No active or  commissioned officer does Secret Service work.    Von Tappken greeted me very tactfully.  This is another typical asset  of a Prussian Service officer, especially a naval man, and is quite  contrary to the usual characteristics of English officials, whose  brusqueness is too well and unpleasantly known.    After offering me a chair and cigars, Captain von Tappken began  chatting.    \"Well, Doctor,\" he said, \"have you made up your mind to enter our  Service?  For a man fond of traveling and adventure, I promise you  will find it tremendously interesting.  I have carefully considered  your equipment and experience and find that they will be of mutual  benefit.\"    I asked him to explain what would be required of me, but he replied:    \"Before my entering upon that, are you adverse to telling me if you  have made up your mind to enter the Service?\"    It was a fair question, and I replied:    \"Yes, provided nothing will be directly required of me that is against  all ethics.\"    I noticed a peculiar smile crossing his features.  Then, looking me  straight between the eyes and using the sharp, incisive language of a  German official, he declared:    \"We make use of the same weapons that are used against us.  We cannot  afford to be squeamish.  The interests at stake are too vast to let  personal ethical questions stand in the way.  What would be required  of you in the first instance, is to gain for us information such as we  seek.  The means by which you gain this information will be left  entirely to your own discretion.  We expect results.  We place our  previous knowledge on the subject required, at your disposal.  You  will have our organization to assist you, but you must understand that  we cannot and will not be able to extricate you from any trouble in  which you may become involved.  Be pleased to understand this clearly.  This service is dangerous, and no official assistance or help could be  given under any circumstances.\"    To my cost, I later found this to be the truth.  So far, so good.  Captain von Tappken had neglected to mention financial inducements and  I put the question to him.    He replied promptly:    \"That depends entirely on the service performed.  In the first  instance you will receive a retaining fee of 4000 marks ($1000) a  year.  You will be allowed 10 marks ($2.50) a day for living expenses,  whether in active service or not.  For each individual piece of work  undertaken you will receive a bonus, the amount of which will vary  with the importance of the mission.  Living expenses accruing while  out on work must not exceed 40 marks ($10) a day.  The amount of the  bonus you are to receive for a mission will in each case be determined  in advance.  There is one other thing.  One-third of all moneys  accruing to you w ill be kept in trust for you at the rate of 5 per  cent interest.\"    I laughed and said:    \"Well, Captain, I can take care of my own money.\"    He permitted the shadow of a smile to play around his mouth.    \"You may be able to,\" he said, \"but most of our agents cannot.  We  have this policy for two reasons: In the first place, it gives us a  definite hold upon our men.  Secondly, we have found that unless we  save some money for our agents, they never save any for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#2)"],[1,"folk. Though,  as you know, they gained one little victory, they were nigh all  killed and cut to pieces. So horrible was the slaughter perpetrated  by the soldiers of the tyrannical Spanish governor Alva, that when  the Prince of Orange again marched into the country not a man joined  him, and he had to fall back without accomplishing anything. The  people seemed stunned by despair. Has not the Inquisition condemned  the whole of the inhabitants of the Netherlands--save only a few  persons specially named--to death as heretics? and has not Philip  confirmed the decree, and ordered it to be carried into instant  execution without regard to age or sex? Were three millions of men,  women, and children ever before sentenced to death by one stroke  of the pen, only because they refused to change their religion?  Every day there are hundreds put to death by the orders of Alva's  Blood Council, as it is called, without even the mockery of a  trial.\"    There was a general murmur of rage and horror from the assembled  party.    \"Were I her queen's majesty,\" an old captain said, striking his fist  on the table, \"I would declare war with Philip of Spain tomorrow,  and would send every man who could bear arms to the Netherlands to  aid the people to free themselves from their tyrants.    \"Ay, and there is not a Protestant in this land but would go  willingly. To think of such cruelty makes the blood run through  my veins as if I were a lad again. Why, in Mary's time there were  two or three score burnt for their religion here in England, and we  thought that a terrible thing. But three millions of people! Why,  it is as many as we have got in all these islands! What think you  of this mates?\"    \"It is past understanding,\" another old sailor said. \"It is too  awful for us to take in.\"    \"It is said,\" another put in, \"that the King of France has leagued  himself with Philip of Spain, and that the two have bound themselves  to exterminate the Protestants in all their dominions, and as that  includes Spain, France, Italy, the Low Countries, and most of  Germany, it stands to reason as we who are Protestants ought to  help our friends; for you may be sure, neighbours, that if Philip  succeeds in the Low Countries he will never rest until he has tried  to bring England under his rule also, and to plant the Inquisition  with its bonfires and its racks and tortures here.\"    An angry murmur of assent ran round the circle.    \"We would fight them, you may be sure,\" Captain Martin said, \"to  the last; but Spain is a mighty power, and all know that there are  no soldiers in Europe can stand against their pikemen. If the Low  Countries, which number as many souls as we, cannot make a stand  against them with all their advantages of rivers, and swamps, and  dykes, and fortified towns, what chance should we have who have  none of these things? What I say, comrades, is this: we have got  to fight Spain--you know the grudge Philip bears us--and it is  far better that we should go over and fight the Spaniards in the  Low Countries, side by side with the people there, and with all the  advantages that their rivers and dykes give, and with the comfort  that our wives and children are safe here at home, than wait till  Spain has crushed down the Netherlands and exterminated the people,  and is then able, with France as her ally, to turn her whole strength  against us. That's what I say.\"    \"And you say right, Captain Martin. If I were the queen's majesty  I would send word to Philip tomorrow to call off his black crew  of monks and inquisitors. The people of the Netherlands have no  thought of resisting the rule of Spain, and would be, as they have  been before, Philip's obedient subjects, if he would but leave  their religion alone. It's the doings of the Inquisition that have  driven them to despair. And when one hears what you are telling us,  that the king has ordered the whole population to be exterminated--man,  woman, and child--no wonder they are preparing to fight  to the last; for it's better to die fighting a thousand times, than  it is to be roasted alive with your wife and children!\"    \"I suppose the queen and her councillors see that if she were to  meddle in this business it might cost her her kingdom, and us our  liberty,\" another captain said. \"The Spaniards could put, they say,  seventy or eighty thousand trained soldiers in the field, while,  except the queen's own bodyguard, there is not a soldier in England;  while their navy is big enough to take the fifteen or twenty ships  the queen has, and to break them up to burn their galley fires.\"    \"That is all true enough,\" Captain Martin agreed; \"but our English  men have fought well on the plains of France before now, and I don't  believe we should fight worse today. We beat the French when they  were ten to one against us over and over, and what our fathers did  we can do. What you say about the navy is true also. They have a  big fleet, and we have no vessels worth speaking about, but we are  as good sailors as the Spaniards any day, and as good fighters;  and though I am not saying we could stop their fleet if it came  sailing up the Thames, I believe when they landed we should show  them that we were as good men as they. They might bring seventy  thousand soldiers, but there would be seven hundred thousand  Englishmen to meet; and if we had but sticks and stones to fight  with, they would not find that they would have an easy victory.\"    \"Yes, that's what you think and I think, neighbour; but, you see,  we have not got the responsibility of it. The queen has to think  for us all. Though I for one would be right glad if she gave the  word for war, she may well hesitate before she takes a step that  might bring ruin, and worse than ruin, upon all her subjects.  We must own, too, that much as we feel for the people of the Low  Countries in their distress, they have not always acted wisely.  That they should take up arms against these cruel tyrants, even  if they had no chance of beating them, is what we all agree would  be right and natural; but when the mob of Antwerp broke into the  cathedral, and destroyed the altars and carvings, and tore up the  vestments, and threw down the Manes and the saints, and then did the  same in the other churches in the town and in the country round,  they behaved worse than children, and showed themselves as intolerant  and bigoted as the Spaniards themselves. They angered Philip beyond  hope of forgiveness, and gave him something like an excuse for his  cruelties towards them.\"    \"Ay, ay, that was a bad business,\" Captain Martin agreed; \"a very  bad business, comrade. And although these things were done by a mere  handful of the scum of the town the respectable citizens raised no  hand to stop it, although they can turn out the town guard readily  enough to put a stop to a quarrel between the members of two of  the guilds. There were plenty of men who have banded themselves  together under the name of 'the beggars,' and swore to fight for  their religion, to have put these fellows down if they had chosen.  They did not choose, and now Philip's vengeance will fall on them  all alike.\"    \"Well, what think you of this business, Ned?\" one of the captains  said, turning to the lad who was standing in a corner, remaining, as  in duty bound, silent in the presence of his elders until addressed.    \"Were I a Dutchman, and living under such a tyranny,\" Ned said  passionately, \"I would rise and fight to the death rather than see  my family martyred. If none other would rise with me, I would take  a sword and go out and slay the first Spaniard I met, and again  another, until I was killed.\"    \"Bravo, Ned! Well spoken, lad!\" three or four of the captains said;  but his father shook his head.    \"Those are the words of hot youth, Ned; and were you living there  you would do as the others--keep quiet till the executioners  came to drag you away, seeing that did you, as you say you would,  use a knife against a Spaniard, it would give the butchers a pretext  for the slaughtering of hundreds of innocent people.\"    The lad looked down abashed at the reproof, then he said: \"Well,  father, if I could not rise in arms or slay a Spaniard and then  be killed, I would leave my home and join the sea beggars under La  Marck.\"    \"There is more reason in that,\" his father replied; \"though La  Marck is a ferocious noble, and his followers make not very close  inquiry whether the ships they attack are Spanish or those of other  people. Still it is hard for a man to starve; and when time passes  and they can light upon no Spanish merchantmen, one cannot blame  them too sorely if they take what they require out of some other  passing ship. But there is reason at the bottom of what you say.  Did the men of the sea coast, seeing that their lives and those of  their families are now at the mercy of the Spaniards, take to their  ships with those dear to them and continually harass the Spaniards,  they could work them great harm, and it would need a large fleet to  overpower them, and that with great difficulty, seeing that they  know the coast and all the rivers and channels, and could take  refuge in shallows where the Spaniards could not follow them. At  present it seems to me the people are in such depths of despair,  that they have not heart for any such enterprise. But I believe that  some day or other the impulse will be given--some more wholesale  butchery than usual will goad them to madness, or the words of some  patriot wake them into action, and then they will rise as one man  and fight until utterly destroyed, for that they can in the end  triumph over Spain is more than any human being can hope.\"    \"Then they must be speedy about it, friend Martin,\" another said.  \"They say that eighty thousand have been put to death one way  or another since Alva came into his government. Another ten years  and there will be scarce an able bodied man"]]]
