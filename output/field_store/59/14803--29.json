Confidence and courage are  the essentials of success in carrying out our plan.  You people must  have faith; you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses.  Let us  unite in banishing fear.  We have provided the machinery to restore  our financial system; it is up to you to support and make it work.    It is your problem no less than it is mine.  Together we cannot  fail.        May 7, 1933.      On a Sunday night a week after my inauguration I used the radio to  tell you about the banking crisis and the measures we were taking  to meet it.  I think that in that way I made clear to the country  various facts that might otherwise have been misunderstood and in  general provided a means of understanding which did much to restore  confidence.    Tonight, eight weeks later, I come for the second time to give you  my report; in the same spirit and by the same means to tell you  about what we have been doing and what we are planning to do.    Two months ago we were facing serious problems.  The country was  dying by inches.  It was dying because trade and commerce had  declined to dangerously low levels; prices for basic commodities  were such as to destroy the value of the assets of national  institutions such as banks, savings banks, insurance companies, and  others.  These institutions, because of their great needs, were  foreclosing mortgages, calling loans, refusing credit.  Thus there  was actually in process of destruction the property of millions of  people who had borrowed money on that property in terms of dollars  which had had an entirely different value from the level of March,  1933.  That situation in that crisis did not call for any  complicated consideration of economic panaceas or fancy plans.  We  were faced by a condition and not a theory.    There were just two alternatives:  The first was to allow the  foreclosures to continue, credit to be withheld and money to go  into hiding, and thus forcing liquidation and bankruptcy of banks,  railroads and insurance companies and a recapitalizing of all  business and all property on a lower level.  This alternative meant  a continuation of what is loosely called \"deflation\", the net  result of which would have been extraordinary hardships on all  property owners and, incidentally, extraordinary hardships on all  persons working for wages through an increase in unemployment and a  further reduction of the wage scale.    It is easy to see that the result of this course would have not  only economic effects of a very serious nature but social results  that might bring incalculable harm.  Even before I was inaugurated I  came to the conclusion that such a policy was too much to ask the  American people to bear.  It involved not only a further loss of  homes, farms, savings and wages but also a loss of spiritual  values--the loss of that sense of security for the present and the  future so necessary to the peace and contentment of the individual  and of his family.  When you destroy these things you will find it  difficult to establish confidence of any sort in the future.  It was  clear that mere appeals from Washington for confidence and the mere  lending of more money to shaky institutions could not stop this  downward course.  A prompt program applied as quickly as possible  seemed to me not only justified but imperative to our national  security.  The Congress, and when I say Congress I mean the members  of both political parties, fully understood this and gave me  generous and intelligent support.  The members of Congress realized  that the methods of normal times had to be replaced in the  emergency by measures which were suited to the serious and pressing  requirements of the moment.  There was no actual surrender of power,  Congress still retained its constitutional authority, and no one  has the slightest desire to change the balance of these powers.  The  function of Congress is to decide what has to be done and to select  the appropriate agency to carry out its will.  To this policy it has  strictly adhered.  The only thing that has been happening has been  to designate the President as the agency to carry out certain of  the purposes of the Congress.  This was constitutional and in  keeping with the past American tradition.    The legislation which has been passed or is in the process of  enactment can properly be considered as part of a well-grounded  plan.    First, we are giving opportunity of employment to one-quarter of a  million of the unemployed, especially the young men who have  dependents, to go into the forestry and flood prevention work.  This  is a big task because it means feeding, clothing and caring for  nearly twice as many men as we have in the regular army itself.  In  creating this civilian conservation corps we are killing two birds  with one stone.  We are clearly enhancing the value of our natural  resources and we are relieving an appreciable amount of actual  distress.  This great group of men has entered upon its work on a  purely voluntary basis; no military training is involved and we are  conserving not only our natural resources, but our human resources.  One of the great values to this work is the fact that it is direct  and requires the intervention of very little machinery.    Second, I have requested the Congress and have secured action upon  a proposal to put the great properties owned by our government at  Muscle Shoals to work after long years of wasteful inaction, and  with this a broad plan for the improvement of a vast area in the  Tennessee Valley.  It will add to the comfort and happiness of  hundreds of thousands of people and the incident benefits will  reach the entire nation.    Next, the Congress is about to pass legislation that will greatly  ease the mortgage distress among the farmers and the home owners of  the nation, by providing for the easing of the burden of debt now  bearing so heavily upon millions of our people.    Our next step in seeking immediate relief is a grant of half a  billion dollars to help the states, counties and municipalities in  their duty to care for those who need direct and immediate relief.    The Congress also passed legislation authorizing the sale of beer  in such states as desired it.  This has already resulted in  considerable reemployment and incidentally has provided much needed  tax revenue.    We are planning to ask the Congress for legislation to enable the  government to undertake public works, thus stimulating directly and  indirectly the employment of many others in well-considered  projects.    Further legislation has been taken up which goes much more  fundamentally into our economic problems.  The Farm Relief Bill  seeks by the use of several methods, alone or together, to bring  about an increased return to farmers for their major farm products,  seeking at the same time to prevent in the days to come disastrous  overproduction which so often in the past has kept farm commodity  prices far below a reasonable return.  This measure provides wide  powers for emergencies.  The extent of its use will depend entirely  upon what the future has in store.    Well-considered and conservative measures will likewise be proposed  which will attempt to give to the industrial workers of the country  a more fair wage return, prevent cut-throat competition and unduly  long hours for labor, and at the same time encourage each industry  to prevent overproduction.    Our Railroad Bill falls into the same class because it seeks to  provide and make certain definite planning by the railroads  themselves, with the assistance of the government, to eliminate the  duplication and waste that is now resulting in railroad  receiverships and continuing operating deficits.    I am certain that the people of this country understand and approve  the broad purposes behind these new governmental policies relating  to agriculture and industry and transportation.  We found ourselves  faced with more agricultural products than we could possibly  consume ourselves and surpluses which other nations did not have  the cash to buy from us except at prices ruinously low.  We found  our factories able to turn out more goods than we could possibly  consume, and at the same time we were faced with a falling export  demand.  We found ourselves with more facilities to transport goods  and crops than there were goods and crops to be transported.  All of  this has been caused in large part by a complete lack of planning  and a complete failure to understand the danger signals that have  been flying ever since the close of the World War.  The people of  this country have been erroneously encouraged to believe that they  could keep on increasing the output of farm and factory  indefinitely and that some magician would find ways and means for  that increased output to be consumed with reasonable profit to the  producer.    Today we have reason to believe that things are a little better  than they were two months ago.  Industry has picked up, railroads  are carrying more freight, farm prices are better, but I am not  going to indulge in issuing proclamations of overenthusiastic  assurance.  We cannot ballyhoo ourselves back to prosperity.  I am  going to be honest at all times with the people of the country.  I  do not want the people of this country to take the foolish course  of letting this improvement come back on another speculative wave.  I do not want the people to believe that because of unjustified  optimism we can resume the ruinous practice of increasing our crop  output and our factory output in the hope that a kind Providence  will find buyers at high prices.  Such a course may bring us  immediate and false prosperity but it will be the kind of  prosperity that will lead us into another tailspin.    It is wholly wrong to call the measure that we have taken  government control of farming, control of industry, and control of  transportation.

Does your father give my particulars?\"    \"He says it is reported that the jailer was sick and unable to  stop Dan.\"    \"Humph!  Then they must have had some sort of a row,\" put in Tom.  \"Well, it does beat the nation how the Baxters do it.  Don't you  remember how Arnold Baxter escaped from the hospital authorities  last year?\"    \"Those Baxters are as slick as you can make them,\" said Frank.  \"I've been thinking if Dan would dare to show himself around  Putnam Hall.\"    \"Not he!\" cried Larry.  \"He'll travel as far can and as fast as he  can.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" mused Dick. \"I rather he will hang around and try to  help his father out of prison.\"    \"That won't help him, for the authorities will be on strict guard  now.  You know the stable door is always locked after the horse is  stolen.\"    At this there was a general laugh, and when it ended a loud roll  of a drum made the young cadets hurry to the front of the parade  ground.    \"Fall in, Companies A and B!\" came the command from the major of  the battalion, and the boys fell in.  Dick was now a first  lieutenant, while Tom and Sam were first and second sergeants  respectively.    As soon as the companies were formed they were marched around the  Hall and to the messroom.  Here they were kept standing in a long  fine while George Strong came to the front with half a dozen new  pupils.    \"Young gentlemen, I will introduce to you several who will join  your ranks for this season,\" said the head assistant.  Then he  began to name the half dozen.  Among others they included a  round-faced German youth named Hans Mueller, and a tall, lank,  red-haired boy, of Irish descent who rejoiced in the name of Jim  Caven.    \"I'll wager the Dutch boy is full of fun,\" whispered Sam to Tom.  \"You can see it in his eyes.\"    \"I don't like the looks of that Jim Caven,\" returned Tom.  \"He  looks like a worse sneak than Mumps ever was.\"    \"I agree there.  Perhaps we had better keep, our eyes open for  him.\"    Despite this talk, however, the newcomers were welcomed cordially,  and to the credit of the students be it said that each old cadet  did all in his power to make the new boys feel perfectly at home.    \"Mine fadder vos von soldier py der Cherman army,\" said Hans  Mueller.  \"Dot's vy he sent me py a military academy ven we come  py dis country.\"    \"Glad to know you intend to help us fight the Indians,\" answered  Tom innocently.    \"Me fight der Indians?  Vot you means py dot?\" demanded Hans, his  light-blue eyes wide open with interest.    \"Why, don't you know that we are here to learn how to fight  Indians?\" went on Tom, with a side wink at those around him.    \"No; I dink me dis vos von school only.\"    \"So it is--a school to learn how to shoot and scalp.\"    \"Schalp!  Vot's dot?\"    \"Cut an Indian's top-knot off with a knife, this way,\" and Tom  made an imaginary slash at Hans' golden locks.    \"Ton't do dot!\" stammered the German boy, falling back.  \"No, I  ton't vant to learn to schalp, noputty.\"    \"But you are willing to fight the Indians, are you not?\" put in  Sam.  \"We are all going to do that, you know.\"    \"I ton't like dem Indians,\" sighed Hans.  \"I see me some of dem  vonde by a show in Chermany, und I vos afraid.\"    At this a laugh went up.  How much further the joke would have  been carried it is impossible to say, but just then a bell rang  and the boys had to go into the classroom.  But Tom remembered  about the Indians, as the others found out about a week later.    As the majority of the scholars had been to the Hall before, it  did not take long for matters to become settled, and in a few days  all of the boys felt thoroughly at home, that is, all but Jim  Caven, who went around with that same sneaking look on his face  that Tom had first noticed.  He made but few friends, and those  only among the smaller boys who had plenty of pocket money to  spend.  Caven rarely showed any money of his own.    With the coming of spring the cadets formed, as of old, several  football teams, and played several notches, including one with  their old rivals, the pupils of Pornell Academy.  This game they  lost, by a score of four to five, which made the Pornellites feel  much better, they having lost every game in the past. (For the  doings of the Putnam Hall students previous to the arrival at that  institution of the Rover boys see, \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" the  first volume of which is entitled, \"The Putnam Hall Cadets.\"--Publisher)    \"Well, we can't expect to beat always,\" said Tom, who played  quarterback on the Putnam team.  \"We gave them a close brush.\"    \"Yes, and we might have won if Larry hadn't slipped and sprained  his ankle,\" put in Sam.  \"Well, never mind; better luck next time.  We'll play them again next fall.\"  Sam was right so far as a game  between the rival academies was concerned, but none of the Rover  boys were on hand to take part in the contest--for reasons which  the chapter to follow will disclose.    With the football came kite-flying, and wonderful indeed were some  of the kites which the boys manufactured.    \"I can tell you, if a fellow had time he could reduce kite-flying  to a regular science,\" said Dick.    \"Oh, Dick, don't give us any more science!\" cried Sam.  \"We get  enough of science from, Uncle Randolph, with his scientific  farming, fowl-raising, and the like.  I would just as lief fly an  old-fashioned kite as anything.\"    \"Dick is right, though,\" put in Fred Garrison.  \"Now you have a  big flat-kite there, three times larger than mine.  Yet I'll wager  my little box kite will fly higher than your kite.\"    \"Done!\" cried Sam.  \"What shall the wager be?\"    \"Ice cream for the boys of our dormitory,\" answered Fred.    \"All right, but how is a fellow to get the cream if he loses?\"    \"That's for him to find out, Sam.  If I lose I'll sneak off to  Cedarville, as Dick did once, and buy what I need.\"    \"Ice cream for our room it is,\" said. Frank.    \"And mum's the word about the wager, or Captain Putnam will spoil  the whole affair if he gets wind of it.\"    \"Make me stakeholder,\" grinned Tom.  \"I'd just like to lay hands on  about two quarts of chocolate cream.\"    \"There won't be any stakeholder,\" said Dick.    \"But when is this kite-flying contest to come off?\"    The matter was talked over, and it was decided to wait until the  next Saturday, which would be, as usual, a half-holiday.  In the  meantime some of the other boys heard there was going to be a  contest, although they knew nothing of the wager made, and half a  dozen other matches were arranged.    Saturday proved to be cool and clear with a stiff breeze blowing  directly from the west.   This being so, it was decided, in order  to get clear of the woods in front of the Hall, to hold the  contests on Baker's Plain, a level patch of ground some distance  to the westward.    The cadets were soon on the way, shouting and laughing merrily  over the sport promised.  Only a few remained behind, including  Jim Caven, who gave as his excuse that he had a headache.    \"I'm glad he is not with us,\" said Dick.  \"I declare, for some  reason, I can't bear to have him around.\"    \"Nor I,\" returned Frank.  \"It's queer, but he gives me the shivers  whenever he comes near me.\"    \"It's a wonder he came here at all.  He doesn't belong in our  style of a crowd.\"    To reach Baker's Plain the cadets had to make a detour around a  high cliff which overlooked a rocky watercourse which flowed into  Cayuga Lake.  They moved slowly, as nobody wished to damage his  kite, and it was after two o'clock before all hands were ready for  the first trial at kite-flying.    \"Gracious, but it is blowing!\" cried Tom.    \"Sam, have you a good strong cord on your kite?\"    \"The strongest I could get,\" answered the youngest Rover.  \"I  guess it is stronger than what Fred has.\"    \"My kite won't pull like yours,\" said Fred Garrison.  \"All ready?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then up they go--and may the best kite win!\"    Soon a dozen kites of various kinds were soaring in the air, some  quite steadily and others darting angrily from side to side.  One  went up with a swoop, to come down with a bang on the rocks, thus  knocking itself into a hundred pieces.    \"Mine cracious, look at dot!\" burst out Hans Mueller.  \"Mine  Gretchen kite vos busted up--und I spent me feefteen cents on  him alreety!\" and a roar went up.    \"Never mind, Hans,\" said Dick. \"You can help sail the Katydid.  She will pull strong enough for two, I am sure.\"    The Katydid was a wonderful affair of silver and gold which Dick  had constructed on ideas entirely his own.  It went up slowly but  surely and proved to be as good a kite as the majority.    A number of girls living in the neighborhood, bad heard of the  kite-flying contests, and now they came up, Dora Stanhope with the  rest, accompanied by her two cousins, Grace and Nellie Laning.  As  my old readers may guess, Dick was very attentive to Dora, and his  brothers were scarcely less so to the two Laning sisters.    \"And how is your mother?\" Dick asked of Dora, during the course of  their conversation.    \"She is much better,\" replied Dora, \"although she is still weak  from her sickness.\"    \"Does she ever mention Josiah Crabtree?\"    \"She mentioned him once.  She said that she had dreamed of him and  of you, Nick.\"    \"Me?  And what was the dream?\"    \"Oh--it was only a silly affair, Dick, not worth mentioning.\"    \"But I would like to know what it was.\"    \"Well, then, she dreamed that both of you were in a big forest and  he was about to attack you with a gun or a club, she couldn't tell  which.  She awoke screaming and I ran to her side, and that is how  she told me of the dream.\"          CHAPTER III    AN OLD ENEMY TURNS UP      \"That was certainly an odd dream,\" said Dick, after a short pause.  \"I am sure I never want to meet Josiah Crabtree under such  circumstances.\"    \"It was"]]]
