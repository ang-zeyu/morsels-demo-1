[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#2)"],[1," an amount of shrewd observation is  summed up in this one saying: \"Upon these foundations, William said he  was satisfied we might trust them; for, says William, I would as soon  trust a man whose interest binds him to be just to me, as a man whose  principle binds himself\" (p. 227). Extremely subtle is also this remark:  \"_Why, says I, did you ever know a pirate repent?_ At this he started a  little and returned, _At the gallows_ I have known _one_ repent, and  I _hope_ thou wilt be the second.\" The character of William the Quaker  pirate is a masterpiece of shrewd humour. He is the first Quaker brought  into English fiction, and we know of no other Friend in latter-day  fiction to equal him. Defoe in his inimitable manner has defined surely  and deftly the peculiar characteristics of the sect in this portrait. On  three separate occasions we find William saving unfortunate natives  or defenceless prisoners from the cruel and wicked barbarity of  the sailors. At page 183, for example, the reader will find a most  penetrating analysis of the dense stupidity which so often accompanies  man's love of bloodshed. The sketch of the second lieutenant, who was  for \"murdering the negroes to make them tell,\" when he could not make  them even understand what he wanted, is worthy of Tolstoy. We have not  space here to dwell upon the scores of passages of similar deep insight  which make \"Captain Singleton\" a most true and vivid commentary on the  life of Defoe's times, but we may call special attention to the passage  on page 189 which describe the sale of the negroes to the planters; to  the description of the awakening of the conscience of Captain Singleton  through terror at the fire-cloud (page 222); and to the extraordinarily  picturesque conversation between William and the captive Dutchman (page  264). Finally, if the reader wishes to taste Defoe's flavour in its  perfection let him examine carefully those passages in the concluding  twenty pages of the book, wherein Captain Singleton is shown as  awakening to the wickedness of his past life, and the admirable dry  reasoning of William by which the Quaker prevents him from committing  suicide and persuades him to keep his ill-gotten wealth, \"with a  resolution to do what right with it we are able; and who knows what  opportunity Providence may put into our hands.... As it is without  doubt, our present business is to go to some place of safety, where we  may wait His will.\" How admirable is the passage about William's sister,  the widow with four children who kept a little shop in the Minories,  and that in which the penitent ex-pirates are shown us as hesitating in  Venice for two years before they durst venture to England for fear of  the gallows.    \"Captain Singleton\" was published in 1720, a year after \"Robinson  Crusoe,\" when Defoe was fifty-nine. Twenty years before had seen \"The  True-Born Englishman\" and \"The Shortest Way with the Dissenters\"; and  we are told that from \"June 1687 to almost the very week of his death in  1731 a stream of controversial books and pamphlets poured from his  pen commenting upon and marking every important passing event.\" The  fecundity of Defoe as a journalist alone surpasses that of any great  journalist we can name, William Cobbett not excepted, and we may add  that the style of \"Captain Singleton,\" like that of \"Robinson Crusoe,\"  is so perfect that there is not a single ineffective passage, or indeed  a weak sentence, to be found in the book.

THE LIFE, ADVENTURES, AND PIRACIES OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON      As it is usual for great persons, whose lives have been remarkable, and  whose actions deserve recording to posterity, to insist much upon their  originals, give full accounts of their families, and the histories of  their ancestors, so, that I may be methodical, I shall do the same,  though I can look but a very little way into my pedigree, as you will  see presently.    If I may believe the woman whom I was taught to call mother, I was  a little boy, of about two years old, very well dressed, had a  nursery-maid to attend me, who took me out on a fine summer's evening  into the fields towards Islington, as she pretended, to give the child  some air; a little girl being with her, of twelve or fourteen years old,  that lived in the neighbourhood. The maid, whether by appointment or  otherwise, meets with a fellow, her sweetheart, as I suppose; he carries  her into a public-house, to give her a pot and a cake; and while they  were toying in the house the girl plays about, with me in her hand, in  the garden and at the door, sometimes in sight, sometimes out of sight,  thinking no harm.    At this juncture comes by one of those sort of people who, it seems,  made it their business to spirit away little children. This was a  hellish trade in those days, and chiefly practised where they found  little children very well dressed, or for bigger children, to sell them  to the plantations.    The woman, pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me, and play  with me, draws the girl a good way from the house, till at last she  makes a fine story to the girl, and bids her go back to the maid, and  tell her where she was with the child; that a gentlewoman had taken  a fancy to the child, and was kissing of it, but she should not be  frighted, or to that purpose; for they were but just there; and so,  while the girl went, she carries me quite away.    From this time, it seems, I was disposed of to a beggar woman that  wanted a pretty little child to set out her case; and after that, to  a gipsy, under whose government I continued till I was about six years  old. And this woman, though I was continually dragged about with her  from one part of the country to another, yet never let me want for  anything; and I called her mother; though she told me at last she was  not my mother, but that she bought me for twelve shillings of another  woman, who told her how she came by me, and told her that my name was  Bob Singleton, not Robert, but plain Bob; for it seems they never knew  by what name I was christened.    It is in vain to reflect here, what a terrible fright"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#2)"],[1," the mischief.\"    \"Is this so, Arthur?\" asked Miss Day, angrily.    The boy hung his head, but made no reply.    \"Very well, then,\" said Miss Day, \"you too must stay at home.\"    \"Surely,\" said Lora, in surprise, \"you will not keep Elsie, since I  have shown you that she was not to blame.\"    \"Miss Lora,\" replied her teacher, haughtily, \"I wish you to understand  that I am not to be dictated to by my pupils.\"    Lora bit her lip, but said nothing, and Miss Day went on hearing the  lessons without further remark.    In the meantime the little Elsie sat at her desk, striving to conquer  the feelings of anger and indignation that were swelling in her breast;  for Elsie, though she possessed much of \"the ornament of a meek and  quiet spirit,\" was not yet perfect, and often had a fierce contest with  her naturally quick temper. Yet it was seldom, very seldom that word or  tone or look betrayed the existence of such feelings; and it was a  common remark in the family that Elsie had no spirit.    The recitations were scarcely finished when the door opened and a lady  entered dressed for a ride.    \"Not through yet, Miss Day?\" she asked.    \"Yes, madam, we are just done,\" replied the teacher, closing the French  grammar and handing it to Louise.    \"Well, I hope your pupils have all done their duty this morning, and  are ready to accompany us to the fair,\" said Mrs. Dinsmore. \"But what  is the matter with Elsie?\"    \"She has failed in all her exercises, and therefore has been told that  she must remain at home,\" replied Miss Day with heightened color and in  a tone of anger; \"and as Miss Lora tells me that Master Arthur was  partly the cause, I have forbidden him also to accompany us.\"    \"Excuse me, Miss Day, for correcting you,\" said Lora, a little  indignantly; \"but I did not say _partly,_ for I am sure it was  _entirely_ his fault.\"    \"Hush, hush, Lora,\" said her mother, a little impatiently; \"how can you  be sure of any such thing; Miss Day, I must beg of you to excuse Arthur  this once, for I have quite set my heart on taking him along. He is  fond of mischief, I know, but he is only a child, and you must not be  too hard upon him.\"    \"Very well, madam,\" replied the governess stiffly, \"you have of course  the best right to control your own children.\"    Mrs. Dinsmore turned to leave the room.    \"Mamma,\" asked Lora, \"is not Elsie to be allowed to go too?\"    \"Elsie is not my child, and I have nothing to say about it. Miss Day,  who knows all the circumstances, is much better able than I to judge  whether or no she is deserving of punishment,\" replied Mrs. Dinsmore,  sailing out of the room.    \"You will let her go, Miss Day?\" said Lora, inquiringly.    \"Miss Lora,\" replied Miss Day, angrily, \"I have already told you I was  not to be dictated to. I have said Elsie must remain at home, and I  shall not break my word.\"    \"Such injustice!\" muttered Lora, turning away.    \"Lora,\" said Louise, impatiently, \"why need you concern yourself with  Elsie's affairs? for my part, I have no pity for her, so full as she is  of nonsensical scruples.\"    Miss Day crossed the room to where Elsie was sitting leaning her head  upon the desk, struggling hard to keep down the feelings of anger and  indignation aroused by the unjust treatment she had received.    \"Did I not order you to learn that lesson over?\" said the governess,  \"and why are you sitting here idling?\"    Elsie dared not speak lest her anger should show itself in words; so  merely raised her head, and hastily brushing away her tears, opened the  book. But Miss Day, who was irritated by Mrs. Dinsmore's interference,  and also by the consciousness that she was acting unjustly, seemed  determined to vent her displeasure upon her innocent victim.    \"Why do you not speak?\" she exclaimed, seizing Elsie by the arm and  shaking her violently. \"Answer me this instant. Why have you been  idling all the morning?\"    \"I have _not_,\" replied the child hastily, stung to the quick by her  unjust violence. \"I have tried hard to do my duty, and you are  punishing me when I don't deserve it at all.\"    \"How dare you? there! take that for your impertinence,\" said Miss Day,  giving her a box on the ear.    Elsie was about to make a still more angry reply; but she restrained  herself, and turning to her book, tried to study, though the hot,  blinding tears came so thick and fast that she could not see a letter.    \"De carriage am waiting, ladies, an' missus in a hurry,\" said a  servant, opening the door; and Miss Day hastily quitted the room,  followed by Louise and Lora; and Elsie was left alone.    She laid down the geography, and opening her desk, took out a small  pocket Bible, which bore the marks of frequent use. She turned over the  leaves as though seeking for some particular passage; at length she  found it, and wiping away the blinding tears, she read these words in a  low, murmuring tone:    \"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure  grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it if, when ye be  buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if when ye do  well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with  God. For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for  us, leaving us an example that ye should follow His steps.\"    \"Oh! I have not done it. I did not take it patiently. I am afraid I am  not following in His steps,\" she cried, bursting into an agony of tears  and sobs.    \"My dear little girl, what is the matter?\" asked a kind voice, and a  soft hand was gently laid on her shoulder.    The child looked up hastily. \"O Miss Allison!\" she said, \"is it you? I  thought I was quite alone.\"    \"And so you were, my dear, until this moment\" replied the lady, drawing  up a chair, and sitting down close beside her. \"I was on the veranda,  and hearing sobs, came in to see if I could be of any assistance. You  look very much distressed; will you not tell me the cause of your  sorrow?\"    Elsie answered only by a fresh burst of tears.    \"They have all gone to the fair and left you at home alone; perhaps to  learn a lesson you have failed in reciting?\" said the lady, inquiringly.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" said the child; \"but that is not the worst;\" and her  tears fell faster, as she laid the little Bible on the desk, and  pointed with her finger to the words she had been reading. \"Oh!\" she  sobbed, \"I--I did not do it; I did not bear it patiently. I was treated  unjustly, and punished when I was not to blame, and I grew angry. Oh!  I'm afraid I shall never be like Jesus! never, never.\"    The child's distress seemed very great, and Miss Allison was extremely  surprised. She was a visitor who had been in the house only a few days,  and, herself a devoted Christian, had been greatly pained by the utter  disregard of the family in which she was sojourning for the teachings  of God's word. Rose Allison was from the North, and Mr. Dinsmore, the  proprietor of Roselands, was an old friend of her father, to whom he  had been paying a visit, and finding Rose in delicate health, he had  prevailed upon her parents to allow her to spend the winter months with  his family in the more congenial clime of their Southern home.    \"My poor child,\" she said, passing her arm around the little one's  waist, \"my poor little Elsie! that is your name, is it not?\"    \"Yes, ma'am; Elsie Dinsmore,\" replied the little girl.    \"Well, Elsie, let me read you another verse from this blessed book.  Here it is: 'The blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from _all_  sin.' And here again: 'If any man sin, we have an advocate with the  Father Jesus Christ the righteous.' Dear Elsie, 'if we confess our  sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.'\"    \"Yes, ma'am,\" said the child; \"I have asked Him to forgive me, and I  know He has; but I am so sorry, oh! _so_ sorry that I have grieved and  displeased Him; for, O Miss Allison! I _do_ love Jesus, and want to be  like Him always.\"    \"Yes, dear child, we must grieve for our sins when we remember that  they helped to slay the Lord. But I am very, very glad to learn that  you love Jesus, and are striving to do His will. I love Him too, and we  will love one another; for you know He says, 'By this shall men know  that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another,'\" said Miss  Allison, stroking the little girl's hair, and kissing her tenderly.    \"Will you love me? Oh! how glad I am,\" exclaimed the child joyfully; \"I  have nobody to love me but poor old mammy.\"    \"And who is mammy?\" asked the lady.    \"My dear old nurse, who has always taken care of me. Have you not seen  her, ma'am?\"    \"Perhaps I may. I have seen a number of nice old colored women about  here since I came. But, Elsie, will you tell me who taught you about  Jesus, and how long you have loved Him?\"    \"Ever since I can remember,\" replied the little girl earnestly; \"and it  was dear old mammy who first told me how He suffered and died on the  cross for us.\" Her eyes filled with tears and her voice quivered with  emotion. \"She used to talk to me about it just as soon as I could  understand anything,\" she continued; \"and then she would tell me that  my own dear mamma loved Jesus, and had gone to be with Him in heaven;  and how, when she was dying, she put me--a little, wee baby, I was then  not quite a week old--into her arms, and said, 'Mammy, take my dear  little baby and love her, and take care of her just as you did of me;  and O mammy! be sure that you teach her to love God.' Would you like to  see my mamma, Miss Allison?\"    And as she spoke she drew from her bosom a miniature set in gold and  diamonds, which she wore suspended by a gold chain around her neck, and  put it in Rose's hand.    It was the likeness of a young and blooming girl, not more than fifteen  or sixteen years of age. She was very beautiful, with a sweet, gentle,  winning countenance, the same soft hazel eyes and golden brown curls  that"]]]
