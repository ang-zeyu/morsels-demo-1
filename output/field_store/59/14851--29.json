Do you remember the first  time we met?\"    \"How could I forget it,\" I said. \"You wore your abundant hair in  brown curls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized  you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like  pallor--you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with  squirrel-skin.\"    \"You were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\"    \"You have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me  forget two thousand years.\"    \"And my faithfulness to you was without equal!\"    \"Well, as far as faithfulness goes--\"    \"Ungrateful!\"    \"I will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but  nevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\"    \"What you call cruel,\" the goddess of love replied eagerly, \"is  simply the element of passion and of natural love, which is woman's  nature and makes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love  everything, that pleases her.\"    \"Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the  unfaithfulness of the woman he loves?\"    \"Indeed!\" she replied. \"We are faithful as long as we love, but you  demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of  herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of  the North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk  of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.\"    \"That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our  relations permanent.\"    \"And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of  paganism,\" she interrupted, \"but that love, which is the highest joy,  which is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you  children of reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you  wish to be natural, you become common._ To you nature seems something  hostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and  out of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay  yourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of  you has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot  pilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow  from his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and  myrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with  you. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us  pagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.  Pompeii was not built for you, nor our villas, our baths, our temples.  You do not require gods. We are chilled in your world.\"    The beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still  closer about her shoulders.    \"Much obliged for the classical lesson,\" I replied, \"but you cannot  deny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit  world as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a  single being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one  sensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you  know this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will  soon feel the feet of the other on his neck--\"    \"And as a rule the man that of the woman,\" cried Madame Venus with  proud mockery, \"which you know better than I.\"    \"Of course, and that is why I don't have any illusions.\"    \"You mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that  reason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\"    \"Madame!\"    \"Don't you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_--since you take so much  delight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one  who desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but  decisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into  woman's hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her  subject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the  end is not wise.\"    \"Exactly your principles,\" I interrupted angrily.    \"They are based on the experience of thousands of years,\" she  replied ironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur.  \"The more devoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers  down and becomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the  more faithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she  plays with him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will  she increase his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has  always been, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine  the Second and Lola Montez.\"    \"I cannot deny,\" I said, \"that nothing will attract a man more than  the picture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who  wantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her  whim--\"    \"And in addition wears furs,\" exclaimed the divinity.    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"I know your predilection.\"    \"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that, since we last saw each other,  you have grown very coquettish.\"    \"In what way, may I ask?\"    \"In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater  advantage than by these dark furs, and that--\"    The divinity laughed.    \"You are dreaming,\" she cried, \"wake up!\" and she clasped my arm  with her marble-white hand. \"Do wake up,\" she repeated raucously with  the low register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.    I saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze;  the voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who  stood before me at his full height of nearly six feet.    \"Do get up,\" continued the good fellow, \"it is really disgraceful.\"    \"What is disgraceful?\"    \"To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\" He snuffed  the candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had  fallen from my hand, \"with a book by\"--he looked at the title page--  \"by Hegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr.  Severin's who is expecting us for tea.\"    \"A curious dream,\" said Severin when I had finished. He supported  his arms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely  veined hands, and fell to pondering.    I knew that he wouldn't move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This  actually happened, but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way  remarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly  three years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be  denied that he was peculiar, although he wasn't quite the dangerous  madman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,  considered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting--and  that is why many also regarded me a bit mad--but to a degree  sympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his  age--he was hardly over thirty--he displayed surprising sobriety, a  certain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely  elaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;  not this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,  hydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord  Chesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion, and  gave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a  wall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his way.    While he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large  venerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking  to and fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang  too. I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of  animals, stuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room  was heaped full, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a  picture which I had seen often enough before. But to-day, under the  reflected red glow of the fire, it made an indescribable impression  on me.    It was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner  of the Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.    A beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant  hair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a  soft hoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm.  She was nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash,  while her bare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like  a slave, like a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed  linaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate  devotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a  martyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but  beardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.    \"_Venus in Furs_,\" I cried, pointing to the picture. \"That is the way  I saw her in my dream.\"    \"I, too,\" said Severin, \"only I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\"    \"Indeed?\"    \"It is a tiresome story.\"    \"Your picture apparently suggested my dream,\" I continued. \"But do  tell me what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your  life, and perhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get  from you.\"    \"Look at its counterpart,\" replied my strange friend, without  heeding my question.    The counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known \"Venus  with the Mirror\" in the Dresden Gallery.    \"And what is the significance?\"    Severin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which  Titian garbed his goddess of love.    \"It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'\" he said with a slight smile. \"I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#2)"],[1,"fast. To work it off, you know.\"    In the course of a beautiful innings of fifty-three that afternoon,  the captain of Blackburn's had received two of Fenn's speediest on the  same spot just above the pad in rapid succession, and he now hobbled  painfully when he moved about.    The conversation that evening had dealt so largely with Fenn--the  whole school, indeed, was talking of nothing but his great attempt to  win the cricket cup single-handed--that Kennedy, going out into the  road for a breather before the rest of the boarders returned from  preparation, made his way to Kay's to see if Fenn was imitating his  example, and taking the air too.    He found him at Kay's gate, and they strolled towards the school  buildings together. Fenn was unusually silent.    \"Well?\" said Kennedy, after a minute had passed without a remark.    \"Well, what?\"    \"What's up?\"    Fenn laughed what novelists are fond of calling a mirthless laugh.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said; \"I'm sick of this place.\"    Kennedy inspected his friend's face anxiously by the light of the lamp  over the school gate. There was no mistake about it. Fenn certainly  did look bad. His face always looked lean and craggy, but tonight  there was a difference. He looked used up.    \"Fagged?\" asked Kennedy.    \"No. Sick.\"    \"What about?\"    \"Everything. I wish you could come into Kay's for a bit just to see  what it's like. Then you'd understand. At present I don't suppose  you've an idea of it. I'd like to write a book on 'Kay Day by Day'.  I'd have plenty to put in it.\"    \"What's he been doing?\"    \"Oh, nothing out of the ordinary run. It's the fact that he's always  at it that does me. You get a houseful of--well, you know the sort of  chap the average Kayite is. They'd keep me busy even if I were allowed  a free hand. But I'm not. Whenever I try and keep order and stop  things a bit, out springs the man Kay from nowhere, and takes the job  out of my hands, makes a ghastly mess of everything, and retires  purring. Once in every three times, or thereabouts, he slangs me in  front of the kids for not keeping order. I'm glad this is the end of  the term. I couldn't stand it much longer. Hullo, here come the chaps  from prep. We'd better be getting back.\"          II    AN EVENING AT KAY'S      They turned, and began to walk towards the houses. Kennedy felt  miserable. He never allowed himself to be put out, to any great  extent, by his own worries, which, indeed, had not been very numerous  up to the present, but the misfortunes of his friends always troubled  him exceedingly. When anything happened to him personally, he found  the discomfort of being in a tight place largely counterbalanced by  the excitement of trying to find a way out. But the impossibility of  helping Fenn in any way depressed him.    \"It must be awful,\" he said, breaking the silence.    \"It is,\" said Fenn, briefly.    \"But haven't the house-matches made any difference? Blackburn's always  frightfully bucked when the house does anything. You can do anything  you like with him if you lift a cup. I should have thought Kay would  have been all right when he saw you knocking up centuries, and getting  into the final, and all that sort of thing.\"    Fenn laughed.    \"Kay!\" he said. \"My dear man, he doesn't _know_. I don't suppose  he's got the remotest idea that we are in the final at all, or, if he  has, he doesn't understand what being in the final means.\"    \"But surely he'll be glad if you lick us tomorrow?\" asked Kennedy.  Such indifference on the part of a house-master respecting the  fortunes of his house seemed to him, having before him the bright  example of Mr Blackburn, almost incredible.    \"I don't suppose so,\" said Fenn. \"Or, if he is, I'll bet he doesn't  show it. He's not like Blackburn. I wish he was. Here he comes, so  perhaps we'd better talk about something else.\"    The vanguard of the boys returning from preparation had passed them,  and they were now standing at the gate of the house. As Fenn spoke, a  little, restless-looking man in cap and gown came up. His clean-shaven  face wore an expression of extreme alertness--the sort of look a ferret  wears as he slips in at the mouth of a rabbit-hole. A doctor, called  upon to sum up Mr Kay at a glance, would probably have said that he  suffered from nerves, which would have been a perfectly correct  diagnosis, though none of the members of his house put his manners and  customs down to that cause. They considered that the methods he  pursued in the management of the house were the outcome of a naturally  malignant disposition. This was, however, not the case. There is no  reason to suppose that Mr Kay did not mean well. But there is no doubt  that he was extremely fussy. And fussiness--with the possible  exceptions of homicidal mania and a taste for arson--is quite the  worst characteristic it is possible for a house-master to possess.    He caught sight of Fenn and Kennedy at the gate, and stopped in his  stride.    \"What are you doing here, Fenn?\" he asked, with an abruptness which  brought a flush to the latter's face. \"Why are you outside the house?\"    Kennedy began to understand why it was that his friend felt so  strongly on the subject of his house-master. If this was the sort of  thing that happened every day, no wonder that there was dissension in  the house of Kay. He tried to imagine Blackburn speaking in that way  to Jimmy Silver or himself, but his imagination was unequal to the  task. Between Mr Blackburn and his prefects there existed a perfect  understanding. He relied on them to see that order was kept, and they  acted accordingly. Fenn, by the exercise of considerable self-control,  had always been scrupulously polite to Mr Kay.    \"I came out to get some fresh air before lock-up, sir,\" he replied.    \"Well, go in. Go in at once. I cannot allow you to be outside the  house at this hour. Go indoors directly.\"    Kennedy expected a scene, but Fenn took it quite quietly.    \"Good night, Kennedy,\" he said.    \"So long,\" said Kennedy.    Fenn caught his eye, and smiled painfully. Then he turned and went  into the house.    Mr Kay's zeal for reform was apparently still unsatisfied. He directed  his batteries towards Kennedy.    \"Go to your house at once, Kennedy. You have no business out here at  this time.\"    This, thought Kennedy, was getting a bit too warm. Mr Kay might do as  he pleased with his own house, but he was hanged if he was going to  trample on _him_.    \"Mr Blackburn is my house-master, sir,\" he said with great respect.    Mr Kay stared.    \"My house-master,\" continued Kennedy with gusto, slightly emphasising  the first word, \"knows that I always go out just before lock-up, and  he has no objection.\"    And, to emphasise this point, he walked towards the school buildings  again. For a moment it seemed as if Mr Kay intended to call him back,  but he thought better of it. Mr Blackburn, in normal circumstances a  pacific man, had one touchy point--his house. He resented any  interference with its management, and was in the habit of saying so.  Mr Kay remembered one painful scene in the Masters' Common Room, when  he had ventured to let fall a few well-meant hints as to how a house  should be ruled. Really, he had thought Blackburn would have choked.  Better, perhaps, to leave him to look after his own affairs.    So Mr Kay followed Fenn indoors, and Kennedy, having watched him  vanish, made his way to Blackburn's.    Quietly as Fenn had taken the incident at the gate, it nevertheless  rankled. He read prayers that night in a distinctly unprayerful mood.  It seemed to him that it would be lucky if he could get through to the  end of the term before Mr Kay applied that last straw which does not  break the backs of camels only. Eight weeks' holiday, with plenty of  cricket, would brace him up for another term. And he had been invited  to play for the county against Middlesex four days after the holidays  began. That should have been a soothing thought. But it really seemed  to make matters worse. It was hard that a man who on Monday would be  bowling against Warner and Beldam, or standing up to Trott and Hearne,  should on the preceding Tuesday be sent indoors like a naughty child  by a man who stood five-feet-one in his boots, and was devoid of any  sort of merit whatever.    It seemed to him that it would help him to sleep peacefully that night  if he worked off a little of his just indignation upon somebody. There  was a noise going on in the fags' room. There always was at Kay's. It  was not a particularly noisy noise--considering; but it had better be  stopped. Badly as Kay had treated him, he remembered that he was head  of the house, and as such it behoved him to keep order in the house.    He went downstairs, and, on arriving on the scene of action, found  that the fags were engaged upon spirited festivities, partly in honour  of the near approach of the summer holidays, partly because--miracles  barred--the house was going on the morrow to lift the cricket-cup.  There were a good many books flying about, and not a few slippers.  There was a confused mass rolling in combat on the floor, and the  table was occupied by a scarlet-faced individual, who passed the time  by kicking violently at certain hands, which were endeavouring to drag  him from his post, and shrieking frenzied abuse at the owners of the  said hands. It was an animated scene, and to a deaf man might have  been most enjoyable.    Fenn's appearance was the signal for a temporary suspension of  hostilities.    \"What the dickens is all this row about?\" he inquired.    No one seemed ready at the moment with a concise explanation. There  was an awkward silence. One or two of the weaker spirits even went so  far as to sit down and begin to read. All would have been well but for  a bright idea which struck some undiscovered youth at the back of the  room.    \"Three cheers for Fenn!\" observed this genial spirit, in no"]]]
