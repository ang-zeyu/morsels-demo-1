At Constantinople, in the fourth century, the transmutation  of metals was very generally believed in, and many of the Greek  ecclesiastics wrote treatises upon the subject. Their names are  preserved, and some notice of their works given, in the third volume of  Lenglet du Fresnoy's \"History of the Hermetic Philosophy.\" Their notion  appears to have been, that all metals were composed of two substances;  the one, metallic earth; and the other, a red inflammable matter, which  they called sulphur. The pure union of these substances formed gold;  but other metals were mixed with and contaminated by various foreign  ingredients. The object of the philosopher's stone was to dissolve or  neutralize all these ingredients, by which iron, lead, copper, and all  metals would be transmuted into the original gold. Many learned and  clever men wasted their time, their health, and their energies, in this  vain pursuit; but for several centuries it took no great hold upon the  imagination of the people. The history of the delusion appears, in a  manner, lost from this time till the eighth century, when it appeared  amongst the Arabians. From this period it becomes easier to trace its  progress. A master then appeared, who was long looked upon as the father  of the science, and whose name is indissolubly connected with it.      GEBER.    Of this philosopher, who devoted his life to the study of alchymy, but  few particulars are known. He is thought to have lived in the year 730.  His true name was Abou Moussah Djafar, to which was added Al Soft, or  \"The Wise,\" and he was born at Hauran, in Mesopotamia. [\"Biographie  Universelle.\"] Some have thought he was a Greek, others a Spaniard, and  others, a prince of Hindostan: but, of all the mistakes which have been  made respecting him, the most ludicrous was that made by the French  translator of Sprenger's \"History of Medicine,\" who thought, from  the sound of his name, that he was a German, and rendered it as the  \"Donnateur,\" or Giver. No details of his life are known; but it  is asserted, that he wrote more than five hundred works upon the  philosopher's stone and the water of life. He was a great enthusiast in  his art, and compared the incredulous to little children shut up in a  narrow room, without windows or aperture, who, because they saw nothing  beyond, denied the existence of the great globe itself. He thought that  a preparation of gold would cure all maladies, not only in man, but in  the inferior animals and plants. He also imagined that all the metals  laboured under disease, with the exception of gold, which was the only  one in perfect health. He affirmed, that the secret of the philosopher's  stone had been more than once discovered; but that the ancient and wise  men who had hit upon it, would never, by word or writing, communicate  it to men, because of their unworthiness and incredulity. [His \"sum of  perfection,\" or instructions to students to aid them in the laborious  search for the stone and elixir, has been translated into most of the  languages of Europe. An English translation, by a great enthusiast  in alchymy, one Richard Russell, was published in London in 1686.  The preface is dated eight years previously, from the house of the  alchymist, \"at the Star, in Newmarket, in Wapping, near the Dock.\" His  design in undertaking the translation was, as he informs us, to expose  the false pretences of the many ignorant pretenders to the science who  abounded in his day.] But the life of Geber, though spent in the pursuit  of this vain chimera, was not altogether useless. He stumbled upon  discoveries which he did not seek, and science is indebted to him for  the first mention of corrosive sublimate, the red oxide of mercury,  nitric acid, and the nitrate of silver. [Article, Geber, \"Biographie  Universelle.\"]    For more than two hundred years after the death of Geber, the Arabian  philosophers devoted themselves to the study of alchymy, joining with it  that of astrology. Of these the most celebrated was      ALFARABI.    Alfarabi flourished at the commencement of the tenth century, and  enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most learned men of his age.  He spent his life in travelling from country to country, that he might  gather the opinions of philosophers upon the great secrets of nature. No  danger dismayed him; no toil wearied him of the pursuit. Many sovereigns  endeavoured to retain him at their courts; but he refused to rest until  he had discovered the great object of his life--the art of preserving it  for centuries, and of making gold as much as he needed. This wandering  mode of life at last proved fatal to him. He had been on a visit to  Mecca, not so much for religious as for philosophical purposes,  when, returning through Syria, he stopped at the court of the Sultan  Seifeddoulet, who was renowned as the patron of learning. He presented  himself in his travelling attire, in the presence of that monarch and  his courtiers; and, without invitation, coolly sat himself down upon the  sofa, beside the Prince. The courtiers and wise men were indignant;  and the Sultan, who did not know the intruder, was at first inclined to  follow their example. He turned to one of his officers, and ordered him  to eject the presumptuous stranger from the room; but Alfarabi, without  moving, dared them to lay hands upon him; and, turning himself calmly  to the prince, remarked, that he did not know who was his guest, or he  would treat him with honour, not with violence. The Sultan, instead  of being still further incensed, as many potentates would have been,  admired his coolness; and, requesting him to sit still closer to him  on the sofa, entered into a long conversation with him upon science  and divine philosophy. All the court were charmed with the stranger.  Questions for discussion were propounded, on all of which he showed  superior knowledge. He convinced every one that ventured to dispute with  him; and spoke so eloquently upon the science of alchymy, that he was  at once recognised as only second to the great Geber himself. One of  the doctors present inquired whether a man who knew so many sciences was  acquainted with music? Alfarabi made no reply, but merely requested that  a lute should be brought him. The lute was brought; and he played such  ravishing and tender melodies, that all the court were melted into  tears. He then changed his theme, and played airs so sprightly, that  he set the grave philosophers, Sultan and all, dancing as fast as their  legs could carry them. He then sobered them again by a mournful strain,  and made them sob and sigh as if broken-hearted. The Sultan, highly  delighted with his powers, entreated him to stay, offering him every  inducement that wealth, power, and dignity could supply; but the  alchymist resolutely refused, it being decreed, he said, that he should  never repose till he had discovered the philosopher's stone. He set out  accordingly the same evening, and was murdered by some thieves in the  deserts of Syria. His biographers give no further particulars of his  life beyond mentioning, that he wrote several valuable treatises on his  art, all of which, however, have been lost. His death happened in the  year 954.      AVICENNA.    Avicenna, whose real name was Ebn Cinna, another great alchymist, was  born at Bokhara, in 980. His reputation as a physician and a man skilled  in all sciences was so great, that the Sultan Magdal Douleth resolved  to try his powers in the great science of government. He was accordingly  made Grand Vizier of that Prince, and ruled the state with some  advantage: but, in a science still more difficult, he failed completely.  He could not rule his own passions, but gave himself up to wine and  women, and led a life of shameless debauchery. Amid the multifarious  pursuits of business and pleasure, he nevertheless found time to write  seven treatises upon the philosopher's stone, which were for many ages  looked upon as of great value by pretenders to the art. It is rare that  an eminent physician, as Avicenna appears to have been, abandons himself  to sensual gratification; but so completely did he become enthralled in  the course of a few years, that he was dismissed from his high office,  and died shortly afterwards, of premature old age and a complication  of maladies, brought on by debauchery. His death took place in the year  1036. After his time, few philosophers of any note in Arabia are heard  of as devoting themselves to the study of alchymy; but it began shortly  afterwards to attract greater attention in Europe. Learned men in  France, England, Spain, and Italy expressed their belief in the  science, and many devoted their whole energies to it. In the twelfth and  thirteenth centuries especially, it was extensively pursued, and some  of the brightest names of that age are connected with it. Among the most  eminent of them are      ALBERTUS MAGNUS and THOMAS AQUINA.    The first of these philosophers was born in the year 1193, of a noble  family at Lawingen, in the duchy of Neuburg, on the Danube. For the  first thirty years of his life, he appeared remarkably dull and stupid,  and it was feared by every one that no good could come of him. He  entered a Dominican monastery at an early age; but made so little  progress in his studies, that he was more than once upon the point  of abandoning them in despair; but he was endowed with extraordinary  perseverance. As he advanced to middle age, his mind expanded, and  he learned whatever he applied himself to with extreme facility. So  remarkable a change was not, in that age, to be accounted for but by a  miracle. It was asserted and believed that the Holy Virgin, touched  with his great desire to become learned and famous, took pity upon his  incapacity, and appeared to him in the cloister where he sat, almost  despairing, and asked him whether he wished to excel in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#2)"],[1,", in which was imparted the knowledge of the Esoteric  philosophy. In both the lesser and higher degrees the initiates  received instruction in an oral manner only; and all were bound by the  most fearful oaths not to reveal the secrets imparted to them.    Thus were the votaries of the ancient Astral worship divided into two  distinct classes, the Esoterics, or Gnostics; and the Exoterics, or  Agnostics; the former comprising those who knew that the Gods were  mythical and the scriptures allegorical; and the latter, those who were  taught that the Gods were real, and the scriptures historical; or, in  other words, it was philosophy for the cultured few, and religion for  the ignorant multitude. The initiates into the secrets of these two  systems recognized them as the two Gospels; and Paul must have had  reference to them in his Epistle to the Galatians ii., 2, where he  distinguishes the Gospel which he preached on ordinary occasions from  that Gospel which he preached \"privately to them which were of  reputation.\"    Such was the system of Astrolatry, which, originating in the Orient,  and becoming, after being remodelled in Egypt, the prototype of all  Occidental forms of worship, was recognized, successively, as the state  religion of the Grecian and Roman Empires; and we propose to describe  the erroneous system of nature upon which it was based, and to develop  the origins of its cycles, dogmas, ordinances, anniversaries,  personifications and symbols, with the view to proving that it was the  very same system which was ultimately perpetuated under the name of  Christianity. We also propose to present the origins and abridged  histories of its two forms, the Jewish, or ancient, and the Roman, or  modern; and to give an account of the conflict between the votaries of  the latter, and the adherents to the established form of worship, which  culminated in the fourth century in the substitution of Christianity as  the state religion of the Roman Empire. We furthermore propose to show  the changes to which the creed and scriptures were subjected during the  Middle Ages, and at the Reformation in the sixteenth century, through  which they assumed the phases as now taught in the theologies,  respectively of Catholicism and Orthodox Protestantism. We also present  an article relative to Freemasonry and Druidism, for the purpose of  showing that, primarily, they were but different forms of the ancient  Astrolatry. We also devote a few pages to the subjects of the Sabbath,  and to that of \"Pious Frauds.\"      Note.--For the matter published in this work, we are principally  indebted to the writings of Robert Taylor, an erudite but recusant  minister of the church of England, who flourished about seventy years  ago, and who, being too honest to continue to preach what, after  thorough investigation, he did not believe, began to give expression to  his doubts by writing and lecturing. Not being able to cope with his  arguments, the clergy, under the charge of the impossible crime of  blasphemy, had him imprisoned for more than two years, during which  time he wrote his great work entitled \"The Diegesis,\" which should be  read by all persons who are investigating the claim of the Christian  religion to Divine authenticity.        THE GEOCENTRIC SYSTEM OF NATURE.    In constructing their system of nature, the ancient Astronomers  constituted it of the Earth, the Firmament, the Planets, the  Constellations and the Zodiac, and we will refer to them in the order  named.      The Earth.    Believing that the earth was the only world, that it was a vast  circular plane, and that it was the fixed and immovable center around  which revolved the celestial luminaries, the ancient Astronomers, in  conformity to the requirement of the doctrine of future rewards and  punishments, as inculcated in the Egyptian Version of the Exoteric  Creed, divided it into an upper and an under, or nether world, which  they connected by a sinuous and tenebrious passage.      The Firmament.    The azure dome, called the firmament in the book of Genesis, was  believed to be a solid transparency, which we find described, in the  fourth chapter and sixth verse, of that collection of Astronomical  Allegories, called the Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation, \"as a sea of  glass like unto crystal.\" It was represented as being supported by four  pillars, resting upon the earth, one at each of the cardinal points,  which were designated as \"the pillars of heaven.\" Conceiving the idea  that there were windows in the firmament, the ancient Astronomers  called them \"the windows of heaven\" and taught that they were opened  when it rained, and closed when it ceased to rain. Hence it is evident  that the ancient Astronomers did not refer to these pillars and windows  in a figurative sense, but as real appurtenances to a solid firmament,  as will be seen by reference to Gen. vii. 11, and viii. 2, Job xxvi.  11, and Malachi iii. 10.      The Planets.    Believing that the stars were but mere flambeaux, suspended beneath the  firmament, and revolving round the earth, for the sole purpose of  giving it light and heat; and observing that seven of these, answering  to the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, had  perceptible movements, in relation to the other luminaries, the ancient  astronomers designated them as planets or wandering stars.      The Constellations.    Perceiving that the other celestial luminaries maintained the same  relation to each other, and designating them as fixed stars, the  ancient astronomers grouped those visible to them into forty-eight  Constellations; and giving names to these, they also attached names to  the stars of larger magnitude, which was done for the purpose of  locating and distinguishing them with greater ease.      The Zodiac.    Through twelve of these Constellations, mostly contained within a belt  of 16 degrees in width, and within which the planets appeared to  revolve, the ancient astronomers inscribed a central line representing  the Ecliptic, or apparent orbit of the sun, which they divided into 360  degrees; and quartering these to denote the seasons, they named the  cardinal points the Summer and Winter Solstices, and the Vernal and  Autumnal Equinoxes; the former referring to the longest and shortest  days of the year; and the latter to the two periods when the days and  nights are equal. An abbreviatory sign having been attached to each of  these constellations, the great celestial belt containing them was  called \"the wheel of the signs,\" or \"a wheel in the middle of a wheel,\"  as designated by that old Astrologer, Ezekiel the Prophet, in chap. i.  and 16th verse. But for the reason that, with only one exception, the  forms of living things, either real or mythical, were given to them,  this belt, ultimately, wad designated as the Zodiac; or Circle of  living Creatures, see Ezekiel, chap. i. Constituting the essential  feature of the ancient Astronomy, we present, in our frontispiece, a  diagram of the Zodiac, as anciently represented, to which, as well as  to Burritts' Celestial Atlas, our readers will be necessitated to make  frequent reference.    [See plate1.gif]    Recent researches among the ruins of ancient cities have developed the  fact that several centuries before the beginning of our era the  astronomers had invented the telescope, and discovered the true or  heliocentric system of nature; but for the reason that religion had  been based upon the false, or geocentric system, it was deemed prudent  not to teach it to the masses. Hence, hiding it away among the other  secrets of the Esoteric philosophy, the knowledge of it was lost during  the Middle Ages; and when rediscovered, the hierarchy of the Church of  Rome, upon the plea that it was contrary to the teachings of Scripture,  resorted to inquisitorial tortures to suppress its promulgation; but,  in spite of all their efforts, it has been universally accepted; and,  in this otherwise enlightened age, we have presented to us the anomaly  of a religion based upon a false system of Astronomy, while its  votaries believe in the true system.        THE SACRED NUMBERS 7 AND 12.    In reference to the planets, and the signs of the Zodiac, the numbers  seven and twelve were recognized as sacred by the ancient Astrologers,  and dedications were made to them in all kinds and sorts of forms. In  the allegories, the genii of the planets were designated as spirits or  messengers to the Supreme Deity, imaginarily enthroned above the  firmament, which we find described in Revelations iv. 5, as \"Seven  lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of  God;\" and which were represented by lights burning in seven branched  candlesticks set before the altars in the temples; the central light  for the Sun; the Moon, Mercury and Venus on one side; and Mars, Jupiter  and Saturn on the other. The seven branched candlesticks seen in all  Catholic churches, and in some Protestant ones, are intended to  represent the same planetary system.    Among the numerous dedications to the genii of the planets we mention  the seven days of the week, the seven stories of the tower of Babylon,  the seven gates of Thebes, the seven piped flute of Pan, the seven  stringed lyre of Apollo, the seven books of fate, the book of seven  seals, the seven castes into which the Egyptians and East Indians were  divided, and the jubilee of seven times seven years. Among the  dedications to the twelve signs we mention the twelve months of the  year, the grand cycle of 12,000 years, the twelve altars of James, the  twelve labors of Hercules, the twelve divisions of the Egyptian  Labyrinth, the twelve shields of Mars, the twelve precious stones,  ranged in threes to denote the seasons, in the breastplate of High  Priest, the twelve foundations of the Sacred City, referred to in the  Book of Revelation, the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve tribes of  Israel, and "]]]
