What they must have in common in order to  form a community or society are aims, beliefs, aspirations, knowledge--a  common understanding--like-mindedness as the sociologists say. Such  things cannot be passed physically from one to another, like bricks;  they cannot be shared as persons would share a pie by dividing it into  physical pieces. The communication which insures participation in a  common understanding is one which secures similar emotional and  intellectual dispositions--like ways of responding to expectations and  requirements.    Persons do not become a society by living in physical proximity, any  more than a man ceases to be socially influenced by being so many feet  or miles removed from others. A book or a letter may institute a more  intimate association between human beings separated thousands of miles  from each other than exists between dwellers under the same roof.  Individuals do not even compose a social group because they all work  for a common end. The parts of a machine work with a maximum of  cooperativeness for a common result, but they do not form a community.  If, however, they were all cognizant of the common end and all  interested in it so that they regulated their specific activity in  view of it, then they would form a community. But this would involve  communication. Each would have to know what the other was about and  would have to have some way of keeping the other informed as to his own  purpose and progress. Consensus demands communication.    We are thus compelled to recognize that within even the most social  group there are many relations which are not as yet social. A large  number of human relationships in any social group are still upon the  machine-like plane. Individuals use one another so as to get desired  results, without reference to the emotional and intellectual disposition  and consent of those used. Such uses express physical superiority, or  superiority of position, skill, technical ability, and command of tools,  mechanical or fiscal. So far as the relations of parent and child,  teacher and pupil, employer and employee, governor and governed, remain  upon this level, they form no true social group, no matter how closely  their respective activities touch one another. Giving and taking of  orders modifies action and results, but does not of itself effect a  sharing of purposes, a communication of interests.    Not only is social life identical with communication, but all  communication (and hence all genuine social life) is educative. To be  a recipient of a communication is to have an enlarged and changed  experience. One shares in what another has thought and felt and in so  far, meagerly or amply, has his own attitude modified. Nor is the one  who communicates left unaffected. Try the experiment of communicating,  with fullness and accuracy, some experience to another, especially if it  be somewhat complicated, and you will find your own attitude toward  your experience changing; otherwise you resort to expletives and  ejaculations. The experience has to be formulated in order to be  communicated. To formulate requires getting outside of it, seeing it as  another would see it, considering what points of contact it has with  the life of another so that it may be got into such form that he can  appreciate its meaning. Except in dealing with commonplaces and catch  phrases one has to assimilate, imaginatively, something of another's  experience in order to tell him intelligently of one's own experience.  All communication is like art. It may fairly be said, therefore, that  any social arrangement that remains vitally social, or vitally shared,  is educative to those who participate in it. Only when it becomes cast  in a mold and runs in a routine way does it lose its educative power.    In final account, then, not only does social life demand teaching and  learning for its own permanence, but the very process of living together  educates. It enlarges and enlightens experience; it stimulates and  enriches imagination; it creates responsibility for accuracy and  vividness of statement and thought. A man really living alone (alone  mentally as well as physically) would have little or no occasion  to reflect upon his past experience to extract its net meaning. The  inequality of achievement between the mature and the immature not only  necessitates teaching the young, but the necessity of this teaching  gives an immense stimulus to reducing experience to that order and form  which will render it most easily communicable and hence most usable.    3. The Place of Formal Education. There is, accordingly, a marked  difference between the education which every one gets from living  with others, as long as he really lives instead of just continuing to  subsist, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case  the education is incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not  the express reason of the association. While it may be said, without  exaggeration, that the measure of the worth of any social institution,  economic, domestic, political, legal, religious, is its effect in  enlarging and improving experience; yet this effect is not a part of  its original motive, which is limited and more immediately practical.  Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the  favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family  life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity;  systematic labor, for the most part, because of enslavement to others,  etc. Only gradually was the by-product of the institution, its effect  upon the quality and extent of conscious life, noted, and only more  gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the  conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart  from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and  emotional reaction of the forms of human association under which the  world's work is carried on receives little attention as compared with  physical output.    But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an  immediate human fact, gains in importance. While it is easy to ignore in  our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition,  or to subordinate that educative effect to some external and tangible  result, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need of  training is too evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their  attitude and habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly  out of account. Since our chief business with them is to enable them to  share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or no we are  forming the powers which will secure this ability. If humanity has made  some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution  is its distinctively human effect--its effect upon conscious  experience--we may well believe that this lesson has been learned  largely through dealings with the young.    We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational  process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of  education--that of direct tuition or schooling. In undeveloped social  groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. Savage groups  mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the  same sort of association which keeps adults loyal to their group. They  have no special devices, material, or institutions for teaching save in  connection with initiation ceremonies by which the youth are inducted  into full social membership. For the most part, they depend upon  children learning the customs of the adults, acquiring their emotional  set and stock of ideas, by sharing in what the elders are doing. In  part, this sharing is direct, taking part in the occupations of adults  and thus serving an apprenticeship; in part, it is indirect, through the  dramatic plays in which children reproduce the actions of grown-ups  and thus learn to know what they are like. To savages it would seem  preposterous to seek out a place where nothing but learning was going on  in order that one might learn.    But as civilization advances, the gap between the capacities of the  young and the concerns of adults widens. Learning by direct sharing in  the pursuits of grown-ups becomes increasingly difficult except in the  case of the less advanced occupations. Much of what adults do is so  remote in space and in meaning that playful imitation is less and less  adequate to reproduce its spirit. Ability to share effectively in adult  activities thus depends upon a prior training given with this end in  view. Intentional agencies--schools--and explicit material--studies--are  devised. The task of teaching certain things is delegated to a special  group of persons.    Without such formal education, it is not possible to transmit all the  resources and achievements of a complex society. It also opens a way to  a kind of experience which would not be accessible to the young, if they  were left to pick up their training in informal association with others,  since books and the symbols of knowledge are mastered.    But there are conspicuous dangers attendant upon the transition from  indirect to formal education. Sharing in actual pursuit, whether  directly or vicariously in play, is at least personal and vital. These  qualities compensate, in some measure, for the narrowness of available  opportunities. Formal instruction, on the contrary, easily becomes  remote and dead--abstract and bookish, to use the ordinary words of  depreciation. What accumulated knowledge exists in low grade societies  is at least put into practice; it is transmuted into character; it  exists with the depth of meaning that attaches to its coming within  urgent daily interests.

He looked up  from under his eyebrows and grunted.    \"How you going to pour coffee down a man that lays flat on his belly and  won't open his mouth?\" he inquired, in an injured tone. \"Sleep's all he  needs, anyway. He'll be all right by morning.\"    The other snorted dissent. \"He'll be all right by dark--or he'll feel a  whole lot worse,\" he promised grimly. \"Dig up some ice. And a good jolt of  bromo, if you've got it--and a towel or two.\"    The bartender wearily pushed the paper to one side, reached languidly under  the bar, and laid hold of a round blue bottle. Yawning uninterestedly, he  poured a double portion of the white crystals into a glass, half filled  another under the faucet of the water cooler, and held them out.    \"Dump that into him, then,\" he advised. \"It'll help some, if you get it  down. What's the sweat to get him married off to-day? Won't the girl wait?\"    \"I never asked her. You pound up some ice and bring it in, will you?\" The  volunteer nurse kicked open the door into the little room and went in,  hastily pouring the bromo seltzer from one glass to the other to keep it  from foaming out of all bounds. His patient was still sitting upon the edge  of the bed where he had left him, slumped forward with his head in his  hands. He looked up stupidly, his eyes bloodshot and swollen of lid.    \"'S the train come in yet?\" he asked thickly. \"'S you, is it, Kent?\"    \"The train's come, and your girl is waiting for you at the hotel. Here,  throw this into you--and for God's sake, brace up! You make me tired. Drink  her down quick--the foam's good for you. Here, you take the stuff in the  bottom, too. Got it? Take off your coat, so I can get at you. You don't  look much like getting married, and that's no josh.\"    Fleetwood shook his head with drunken gravity, and groaned. \"I ought to be  killed. Drunk to-day!\" He sagged forward again, and seemed disposed to shed  tears. \"She'll never forgive me; she--\"    Kent jerked him to his feet peremptorily. \"Aw, look here! I'm trying  to sober you up. You've got to do your part--see? Here's some ice in a  towel--you get it on your head. Open up your shirt, so I can bathe your  chest. Don't do any good to blubber around about it. Your girl can't hear  you, and Jim and I ain't sympathetic. Set down in this chair, where we can  get at you.\" He enforced his command with some vigor, and Fleetwood groaned  again. But he shed no more tears, and he grew momentarily more lucid, as  the treatment took effect.    The tears were being shed in the stuffy little hotel parlor. The young  woman looked often at her watch, went into the hallway, and opened the  outer door several times, meditating a search of the town, and drew back  always with a timid fluttering of heart because it was all so crude and  strange, and the saloons so numerous and terrifying in their very bald  simplicity.    She was worried about Manley, and she wished that cowboy would come out  of the saloon and bring her lover to her. She had never dreamed of being  treated in this way. No one came near her--and she had secretly expected to  cause something of a flutter in this little town they called Hope.    Surely, young girls from the East, come out to get married to their  sweethearts, weren't so numerous that they should be ignored. If there were  other people in the hotel, they did not manifest their presence, save by  disquieting noises muffled by intervening partitions.    She grew thirsty, but she hesitated to explore the depths of this dreary  abode, in fear of worse horrors than the parlor furniture, and all the  places of refreshment which she could see from the window or the door  looked terribly masculine and unmoral, and as if they did not know there  existed such things as ice cream, or soda, or sherbet.    It was after an hour of this that the tears came, which is saying a good  deal for her courage. It seemed to her then that Manley must be dead. What  else could keep him so long away from her, after three years of impassioned  longing written twice a week with punctilious regularity?    He knew that she was coming. She had telegraphed from St. Paul, and had  received a joyful reply, lavishly expressed in seventeen words instead of  the ten-word limit. And they were to have been married immediately upon her  arrival.    That cowboy had known she was coming; he must also have known why Manley  did not meet her, and she wished futilely that she had questioned him,  instead of walking beside him without a word. He should have explained. He  would have explained if he had not been so very anxious to get inside that  saloon and get drunk.    She had always heard that cowboys were chivalrous, and brave, and  fascinating in their picturesque dare-deviltry, but from the lone specimen  which she had met she could not see that they possessed any of those  qualities. If all cowboys were like that, she hoped that she would not be  compelled to meet any of them. And _why_ didn't Manley come?    It was then that an inner door--a door which she had wanted to open, but  had lacked courage--squeaked upon its hinges, and an ill-kept bundle of  hair was thrust in, topping a weather-beaten face and a scrawny little  body. Two faded, inquisitive eyes looked her over, and the woman sidled in,  somewhat abashed, but too curious to remain outside.    \"Oh yes!\" She seemed to be answering some inner question. \"I didn't know  you was here.\" She went over and removed the newspaper from the portrait.  \"That breed girl of mine ain't got the least idea of how to straighten up  a room,\" she observed complainingly. \"I guess she thinks this picture was  made to hang things on. I'll have to round her up again and tell her a few  things. This is my first husband. He was in politics and got beat, and so  he killed himself. He couldn't stand to have folks give him the laugh.\" She  spoke with pride. \"He was a real handsome man, don't you think? You mighta  took off the paper; it didn't belong there, and he does brighten up the  room. A good picture is real company, seems to me. When my old man gets on  the rampage till I can't stand it no longer, I come in here and set, and  look at Walt. 'T ain't every man that's got nerve to kill himself--with a  shotgun. It was turrible! He took and tied a string to the trigger--\"    \"Oh, please!\"    The landlady stopped short and stared at her. \"What? Oh, I won't go into  details--it was awful messy, and that's a fact. I didn't git over it for a  couple of months. He coulda killed himself with a six-shooter; it's always  been a mystery why he dug up that old shotgun, but he did. I always thought  he wanted to show his nerve.\" She sighed, and drew her fingers across her  eyes. \"I don't s'pose I ever will git over it,\" she added complacently. \"It  was a turrible shock.\"    \"Do you know,\" the girl began desperately, \"if Mr. Manley Fleetwood is in  town? I expected him to meet me at the train.\"    \"Oh! I kinda _thought_ you was Man Fleetwood's girl. My name's Hawley. You  going to be married to-night, ain't you?\"    \"I--I haven't seen Mr. Fleetwood yet,\" hesitated the girl, and her eyes  filled again with tears. \"I'm afraid something may have happened to him.  He--\"    Mrs. Hawley glimpsed the tears, and instantly became motherly in her  manner. She even went up and patted the girl on the shoulder.    \"There, now, don't you worry none. Man's all right; I seen him at dinner  time. He was--\" She stopped short, looked keenly at the delicate face,  and at the yellow-brown eyes which gazed back at her, innocent of evil,  trusting, wistful. \"He spoke about your coming, and said he'd want the use  of the parlor this evening, for the wedding. I had an idea you was coming  on the six-twenty train. Maybe he thought so, too. I never heard you come  in--I was busy frying doughnuts in the kitchen--and I just happened to come  in here after something. You'd oughta rapped on that door. Then I'd 'a'  known you was here. I'll go and have my old man hunt him up. He must be  around town somewheres. Like as not he'll meet the six-twenty, expecting  you to be on it.\"    She smiled reassuringly as she turned to the inner door.    \"You take off your hat and jacket, and pretty soon I'll show you up to a  room. I'll have to round up my old man first--and that's liable to take  time.\" She turned her eyes quizzically to the porky-cheeked portrait. \"You  jest let Walt keep you company till I get back. He was real good company  when he was livin'.\"    She smiled again and went out briskly, came back, and stood with her hand  upon the cracked doorknob.    \"I clean forgot your name,\" she hinted. \"Man told me, at dinner time, but  I'm no good on earth at remembering names till after I've seen the person  it belongs to.\"    \"Valeria Peyson--Val, they call me usually, at home.\" The homesickness of  the girl shone in her misty eyes, haunted her voice. Mrs. Hawley read it,  and spoke more briskly than she would otherwise have done.    \"Well, we're plumb strangers, but we ain't going to stay that way, because  every time you come to town you'll have to stop here; there ain't any other  place to stop. And I'm going to start right in calling you Val. We don't  use no ceremony with folk's names, out here. Val's a real nice name, short  and easy to say. Mine's Arline. You can call me by it if you want to. I  don't let everybody--so many wants to cut it down to Leen, and I won't  stand for that; I'm _lean_ enough, without havin' it throwed up to me. We  might jest as well start in the way we're likely to keep it up, and you  won't feel so much like a stranger.    \"I'm awful glad you're going to settle here--there ain't so awful many  women in the country; we have to rake and scrape to git enough for three  sets when we have a dance--and more likely we can't make out more 'n two.
