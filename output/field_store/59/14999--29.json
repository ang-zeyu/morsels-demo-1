But this is not the only effect, which this severity produces: for  while it hardens their hearts, and makes them insensible of the misery  of their fellow-creatures, it begets a turn for wanton cruelty. As a  proof of this, we shall mention one, among the many instances that  occur, where ingenuity has been exerted in contriving modes of torture.  \"An iron coffin, with holes in it, was kept by a certain colonist, as an  auxiliary to the lash. In this the poor victim of the master's  resentment was inclosed, and placed sufficiently near a fire, to  occasion extreme pain, and consequently shrieks and groans, until the  revenge of the master was satiated, without any other inconvenience on  his part, than a temporary suspension of the slave's labour. Had he been  flogged to death, or his limbs mutilated, the interest of the brutal  tyrant would have suffered a more irreparable loss.    \"In mentioning, this instance, we do not mean to insinuate, that it is  common. We know that it was reprobated by many. All that we would infer  from it is, that where men are habituated to a system of severity, they  become _wantonly cruel_, and that the mere toleration of such an  instrument of torture, in any country, is a clear indication, _that  this wretched class of men do not there enjoy the protection of any  laws, that may be pretended to have been enacted in their favour_.\"    Such then is the general situation of the unfortunate Africans. They are  beaten and tortured at discretion. They are badly clothed. They are  miserably fed. Their drudgery is intense and incessant and their rest  short. For scarcely are their heads reclined, scarcely have their bodies  a respite from the labour of the day, or the cruel hand of the overseer,  but they are summoned to renew their sorrows. In this manner they go on  from year to year, in a state of the lowest degradation, without a  single law to protect them, without the possibility of redress, without  a hope that their situation will be changed, unless death should  terminate the scene.    Having described the general situation of these unfortunate people, we  shall now take notice of the common consequences that are found to  attend it, and relate them separately, as they result either from long  and painful _labour_, a _want_ of the common necessaries of  life, or continual _severity_.    Oppressed by a daily task of such immoderate labour as human nature is  utterly unable to perform, many of them run away from their masters.  They fly to the recesses of the mountains, where they choose rather to  live upon any thing that the soil affords them, nay, the very soil  itself, than return to that _happy situation_, which is represented  by the _receivers_, as the condition of a slave.    It sometimes happens, that the manager of a mountain plantation, falls  in with one of these; he immediately seizes him, and threatens to carry  him to his former master, unless he will consent to live on the mountain  and cultivate his ground. When his plantation is put in order, he  carries the delinquent home, abandons him to all the suggestions of  despotick rage, and accepts a reward for his _honesty_. The unhappy  wretch is chained, scourged, tortured; and all this, because he obeyed  the dictates of nature, and wanted to be free. And who is there, that  would not have done the same thing, in the same situation? Who is there,  that has once known the charms of liberty; that would not fly from  despotism? And yet, by the impious laws of the _receivers_, the  absence[066] of six months from the lash of tyranny is--_death_.    But this law is even mild, when compared with another against the same  offence, which was in force sometime ago, and which we fear is even now  in force, in some of those colonies which this account of the treatment  comprehends. \"Advertisements have frequently appeared there, offering a  reward for the apprehending of fugitive slaves either alive or  _dead_. The following instance was given us by a person of  unquestionable veracity, under whose own observation it fell. As he was  travelling in one of the colonies alluded to, he observed some people in  pursuit of a poor wretch, who was seeking in the wilderness an asylum  from his labours. He heard the discharge of a gun, and soon afterwards  stopping at an house for refreshment, the head of the fugitive, still  reeking with blood, was brought in and laid upon a table with  exultation. The production of such a trophy was the proof _required by  law_ to entitle the heroes to their reward.\" Now reader determine if  you can, who were the most execrable; the rulers of the state in  authorizing murder, or the people in being bribed to commit it.    This is one of the common consequences of that immoderate share of  labour, which is imposed upon them; nor is that, which is the result of  a scanty allowance of food, less to be lamented. The wretched African is  often so deeply pierced by the excruciating fangs of hunger, as almost  to be driven to despair. What is he to do in such a trying situation?  Let him apply to the _receivers_. Alas! the majesty of _receivership_  is too sacred for the appeal, and the intrusion would be  fatal. Thus attacked on the one hand, and shut out from every  possibility of relief on the other, he has only the choice of being  starved, or of relieving his necessities by taking a small portion of  the fruits of his own labour. Horrid crime! to be found eating the  cane, which probably his own hands have planted, and to be eating it,  because his necessities were pressing! This crime however is of such a  magnitude, as always to be accompanied with the whip; and so  unmercifully has it been applied on such an occasion, as to have been  the cause, in wet weather, of the delinquent's death. But the smart of  the whip has not been the only pain that the wretched Africans have  experienced. Any thing that passion could seize, and convert into an  instrument of punishment, has been used; and, horrid to relate! the very  knife has not been overlooked in the fit of phrenzy. Ears have been  slit, eyes have been beaten out, and bones have been broken; and so  frequently has this been the case, that it has been a matter of constant  lamentation with disinterested people, who out of curiosity have  attended the markets[067] to which these unhappy people weekly resort,  that they have not been able to turn their eyes on any group of them  whatever, but they have beheld these inhuman marks of passion,  despotism, and caprice.    But these instances of barbarity have not been able to deter them from  similar proceedings. And indeed, how can it be expected that they  should? They have still the same appetite to be satisfied as before, and  to drive them to desperation. They creep out clandestinely by night, and  go in search of food into their master's, or some neighbouring  plantation. But here they are almost equally sure of suffering. The  watchman, who will be punished himself, if he neglects his duty,  frequently seizes them in the fact. No excuse or intreaty will avail; he  must punish them for an example, and he must punish them, not with a  stick, nor with a whip, but with a cutlass. Thus it happens, that these  unhappy slaves, if they are taken, are either sent away mangled in a  barbarous manner, or are killed upon the spot.    We may now mention the consequences of the severity. The wretched  Africans, daily subjected to the lash, and unmercifully whipt and beaten  on every trifling occasion, have been found to resist their opposers.  Unpardonable crime! that they should have the feelings of nature! that  their breasts should glow with resentment on an injury! that they should  be so far overcome, as to resist those, whom _they are under no  obligations to obey_, and whose only title to their services consists  in _a violation of the rights of men_! What has been the  consequence?--But here let us spare the feelings of the reader, (we  wish we could spare our own) and let us only say, without a recital of  the cruelty, _that they have been murdered at the discretion of their  masters_. For let the reader observe, that the life of an African is  only valued at a price, that would scarcely purchase an horse; that the  master has a power of murdering his slave, if he pays but a trifling  fine; and that the murder must be attended with uncommon circumstances  of horrour, if it even produces an inquiry.    Immortal Alfred! father of our invaluable constitution! parent of the  civil blessings we enjoy! how ought thy laws to excite our love and  veneration, who hast forbidden us, thy posterity, to tremble at the  frown of tyrants! how ought they to perpetuate thy name, as venerable,  to the remotest ages, who has secured, even to the meanest servant, a  fair and impartial trial! How much does nature approve thy laws, as  consistent with her own feelings, while she absolutely turns pale,  trembles, and recoils, at the institutions of these _receivers_!  Execrable men! you do not murder the horse, on which you only ride; you  do not mutilate the cow, which only affords you her milk; you do not  torture the dog, which is but a partial servant of your pleasures: but  these unfortunate men, from whom, you derive your very pleasures and  your fortunes, you torture, mutilate, murder at discretion! Sleep then  you _receivers_, if you can, while you scarcely allow these  unfortunate people to rest at all! feast if you can, and indulge your  genius, while you daily apply to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#20)"],[1,"George Fox, had the boldness in the same island to  deliver his sentiments to the governor on the same subject. Having been  brought before him and accused of making the Africans Christians, or, in  other words, of making them rebel and destroy their owners, he replied,  \"That it was a good thing to bring them to the knowledge of God and  Christ Jesus, and to believe in him who died for them and all men, and  that this would keep them from rebelling, or cutting any person's  throat; but if they did rebel and cut their throats, as the governor  insinuated they would, it would be their own doing, in keeping them in  ignorance and under oppression, in giving them liberty to be common with  women like brutes, and, on the other hand, in starving them for want of  meat and clothes convenient; thus, giving them liberty in that which God  restrained, and restraining them in that which was meat and clothing.\"    I do not find any individual of this society moving in this cause, for  some time after the death of George Fox and William Edmundson. The first  circumstance of moment which I discover, is a resolution of the whole  Society on the subject, at their yearly meeting, held in London in the  year 1727. The resolution was contained in the following words:--\"It is  the sense of this meeting, that the importing of negroes from their  native country and relations by Friends is not a commendable nor allowed  practice, and is, therefore, censured by this meeting.\"    In the year 1758, the Quakers thought it their duty, as a body, to pass  another resolution upon this subject. At this, time the nature of the  trade beginning to be better known, we find them more animated upon it,  as the following extract will show:--    \"We fervently warn all in profession with us, that they carefully avoid  being any way concerned in reaping the unrighteous profits, arising from  the iniquitous practice of dealing in negro or other slaves; whereby, in  the original purchase, one man selleth another, as he doth the beasts  that perish, without any better pretension to a property in him than  that of superior force; in direct violation of the Gospel rule, which  teacheth all to do as they would be done by, and to do good to all;  being the reverse of that covetous disposition, which furnisheth  encouragement to those poor ignorant people to perpetuate their savage  wars, in order to supply the demands of this most unnatural traffic, by  which great numbers of mankind, free by nature, are subject to  inextricable bondage, and which hath often been observed to fill their  possessors with haughtiness, tyranny, luxury, and barbarity, corrupting  the minds and debasing the morals of their children, to the unspeakable  prejudice of religion and virtue, and the exclusion of that holy spirit  of universal love, meekness, and charity, which is the unchangeable  nature and the glory of true Christianity. We, therefore, can do no  less, than, with the greatest earnestness, impress it upon Friends  everywhere, that they endeavour to keep their hands clear of this  unrighteous gain of oppression.\"    The Quakers hitherto, as appears by the two resolutions which have been  quoted, did nothing more than seriously warn all those in religious  profession with them against being concerned in this trade. But in three  years afterwards, or at the yearly meeting in 1761, they came to a  resolution, as we find by the following extract from their minutes, that  any of their members haying a concern in it should be disowned:--\"This  meeting having reason to apprehend that divers under our name, are  concerned in the unchristian traffic in negroes, doth recommend it  earnestly to the care of Friends everywhere, to discourage, as much as  in them lies, a practice so repugnant to our Christian profession; and  to deal with all such as shall persevere in a conduct so reproachful to  Christianity; and to disown them, if they desist not therefrom.\"    The yearly meeting of 1761, having thus agreed to exclude from  membership such as should be found concerned in this trade, that of 1763  endeavoured to draw the cords, still tighter, by attaching criminality  to those who should aid and abet the trade in any manner. By the minute,  which was made on this occasion, I apprehend that no one belonging to  the Society could furnish even materials for such voyages. \"We renew our  exhortation, that Friends everywhere be especially careful to keep their  hands clear of giving encouragement in any shape to the Slave Trade, it  being evidently destructive of the natural rights of mankind, who are  all ransomed by one Saviour, and visited by one divine light, in order  to salvation; a traffic calculated to enrich and aggrandize some upon  the misery of others; in its nature abhorrent to every just and tender  sentiment, and contrary to the whole tenour of the Gospel.\"    Some pleasing intelligence having been sent on this subject, by the  Society in America to the Society in England, the yearly meeting of 1772  thought it their duty to notice it, and to keep their former resolutions  alive by the following minute:--\"It appears that the practice of holding  negroes in oppressive and unnatural bondage hath been so successfully  discouraged by Friends in some of the colonies, as to be considerably  lessened. We cannot but approve of these salutary endeavours, and  earnestly intreat that they may be continued, that through the favour of  divine Providence a traffic, so unmerciful and unjust in its nature to a  part of our own species made, equally with ourselves, for immortality,  may come to be considered by all in its proper light, and be utterly  abolished as a reproach to the Christian name.\"    I must beg leave to stop here for a moment, just to pay the Quakers a  due tribute of respect for the proper estimation, in which they have  uniformly held the miserable outcasts of society, who have been the  subject of these minutes. What a contrast does it afford to the  sentiments of many others concerning them! How have we been compelled to  prove by a long chain of evidence, that they had the same feelings and  capacities as ourselves! How many, professing themselves enlightened,  even now view them as of a different species! But in the minutes which  have been cited we have seen them uniformly represented, as persons  \"ransomed by one and the same Saviour,\" \"as visited by one and the same  light for salvation,\" and \"as made equally for immortality as others.\"  These practical views of mankind, as they are highly honourable to the  members of this Society, so they afford a proof both of the reality and  of the consistency of their religion.    But to return:--From this time, there appears to have been a growing  desire in this benevolent society to step out of its ordinary course in  behalf of this injured people. It had hitherto confined itself to the  keeping of its own members unpolluted by any gain from their oppression.  But it was now ready to make an appeal to others, and to bear a more  public testimony in their favour. Accordingly, in the month of June,  1783, when a bill had been brought into the House of Commons for certain  regulations to be made with respect to the African Trade, the society  sent the following petition to that branch of the legislature:--    \"Your petitioners, met in this their annual assembly, having solemnly  considered the state of the enslaved negroes, conceive themselves  engaged, in religious duty, to lay the suffering situation of that  unhappy people before you, as a subject loudly calling for the humane  interposition of the legislature,    \"Your petitioners regret that a nation, professing the Christian faith,  should so far counteract the principles of humanity and justice, as by  the cruel treatment of this oppressed race to fill their minds with  prejudices against the mild and beneficent doctrines of the gospel.    \"Under the countenance of the laws of this country, many thousand of  these our fellow-creatures, entitled to the natural rights of mankind,  are held as personal property in cruel bondage; and your petitioners  being informed that a Bill for the Regulation of the African Trade is  now before the House, containing a clause which restrains the officers  of the African Company from exporting negroes, your petitioners, deeply  affected with a consideration of the rapine, oppression, and bloodshed,  attending this traffic, humbly request that this restriction may be  extended to all persons whomsoever, or that the House would grant such  other relief in the premises as in its wisdom may seem meet.\"    This petition was presented by Sir Cecil Wray, who, on introducing it,  spoke very respectfully of the society. He declared his hearty  approbation of their application, and said he hoped he should see the  day when not a slave would remain within the dominions of this realm.  Lord North seconded the motion, saying he could have no objection to the  petition, and that its object ought to recommend it to every humane  breast; that it did credit to the most benevolent society in the world;  but that, the session, being so far advanced, the subject, could not  then be taken into consideration; and he regretted that the Slave Trade,  against which the petition was so justly directed, was in a commercial  view become necessary to almost every nation of Europe. The petition was  then brought up and read, after which it was ordered to lie on the  table. This was the first petition (being two years earlier than that  from the inhabitants of Bridgewater), which was ever presented to  parliament for the abolition of the Slave Trade.    But the society did not stop here; for having at the yearly meeting of  1783 particularly recommended the cause to a standing committee,  appointed to act at intervals, called the Meeting for Sufferings, the  latter in this same year resolved upon an address to the public,  entitled, _The Case of our Fellow-"]]]
