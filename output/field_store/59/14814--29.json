THE PROPHECY OF JOHN THE REVELATOR.        THE APOSTASY AND THE RESTORATION.    In the reign of Tiberius of Rome, the Lord Jesus was crucified. At  the hour of the atonement, His Gospel was to the dominant earthly  power only \"a deadly superstition,\" [1] \"a strange and pestilent  superstition,\" [2] sought to be crushed at any cost by the ruthless  power of the pagan empire. Thus came the persecutions of the early  Christians, lasting until after Christianity, with irresistible power,  had \"sprung up, even in Rome, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#2)"],[1,"evil that assailed him. There was  no hope of remedy, save that he showed steadiness of mind in the study of  the Scriptures. 'He suffers, continued the letter of the sage,' from the  awakening of those harpies the passions, which have slept with him, as  with others, till the period of life which he has now attained. Better,  far better, that they torment him by ungrateful cravings than that he  should have to repent having satiated them by criminal indulgence.'    The dispositions of the young man were so excellent that he combated, by  reason and religion, the fits of gloom which at times overcast his mind,  and it was not till he attained the commencement of his twenty-first year  that they assumed a character which made his father tremble for the  consequences. It seemed as if the gloomiest and most hideous of mental  maladies was taking the form of religious despair. Still the youth was  gentle, courteous, affectionate, and submissive to his father's will, and  resisted with all his power the dark suggestions which were breathed into  his mind, as it seemed by some emanation of the Evil Principle, exhorting  him, like the wicked wife of Job, to curse God and die.    The time at length arrived when he was to perform what was then thought a  long and somewhat perilous journey, to the mansion of the early friend  who had calculated his nativity. His road lay through several places of  interest, and he enjoyed the amusement of travelling more than he himself  thought would have been possible. Thus he did not reach the place of his  destination till noon on the day preceding his birthday. It seemed as if  he had been carried away with an unwonted tide of pleasurable sensation,  so as to forget in some degree what his father had communicated  concerning the purpose of his journey. He halted at length before a  respectable but solitary old mansion, to which he was directed as the  abode of his father's friend.    The servants who came to take his horse told him he had been expected for  two days. He was led into a study, where the stranger, now a venerable  old man, who had been his father's guest, met him with a shade of  displeasure, as well as gravity, on his brow. 'Young man,' he said,  'wherefore so slow on a journey of such importance?' 'I thought,' replied  the guest, blushing and looking downward,' that there was no harm in  travelling slowly and satisfying my curiosity, providing I could reach  your residence by this day; for such was my father's charge.' 'You were  to blame,' replied the sage, 'in lingering, considering that the avenger  of blood was pressing on your footsteps. But you are come at last, and we  will hope for the best, though the conflict in which you are to be  engaged will be found more dreadful the longer it is postponed. But first  accept of such refreshments as nature requires to satisfy, but not to  pamper, the appetite.'    The old man led the way into a summer parlour, where a frugal meal was  placed on the table. As they sat down to the board they were joined by a  young lady about eighteen years of age, and so lovely that the sight of  her carried off the feelings of the young stranger from the peculiarity  and mystery of his own lot, and riveted his attention to everything she  did or said. She spoke little and it was on the most serious subjects.  She played on the harpsichord at her father's command, but it was hymns  with which she accompanied the instrument. At length, on a sign from the  sage, she left the room, turning on the young stranger as she departed a  look of inexpressible anxiety and interest.    The old man then conducted the youth to his study, and conversed with him  upon the most important points of religion, to satisfy himself that he  could render a reason for the faith that was in him. During the  examination the youth, in spite of himself, felt his mind occasionally  wander, and his recollections go in quest of the beautiful vision who had  shared their meal at noon. On such occasions the Astrologer looked grave,  and shook his head at this relaxation of attention; yet, on the whole, he  was pleased with the youth's replies.    At sunset the young man was made to take the bath; and, having done so,  he was directed to attire himself in a robe somewhat like that worn by  Armenians, having his long hair combed down on his shoulders, and his  neck, hands, and feet bare. In this guise he was conducted into a remote  chamber totally devoid of furniture, excepting a lamp, a chair, and a  table, on which lay a Bible. 'Here,' said the Astrologer, 'I must leave  you alone to pass the most critical period of your life. If you can, by  recollection of the great truths of which we have spoken, repel the  attacks which will be made on your courage and your principles, you have  nothing to apprehend. But the trial will be severe and arduous.' His  features then assumed a pathetic solemnity, the tears stood in his eyes,  and his voice faltered with emotion as he said, 'Dear child, at whose  coming into the world I foresaw this fatal trial, may God give thee grace  to support it with firmness!'    The young man was left alone; and hardly did he find himself so, when,  like a swarm of demons, the recollection of all his sins of omission and  commission, rendered even more terrible by the scrupulousness with which  he had been educated, rushed on his mind, and, like furies armed with  fiery scourges, seemed determined to drive him to despair. As he combated  these horrible recollections with distracted feelings, but with a  resolved mind, he became aware that his arguments were answered by the  sophistry of another, and that the dispute was no longer confined to his  own thoughts. The Author of Evil was present in the room with him in  bodily shape, and, potent with spirits of a melancholy cast, was  impressing upon him the desperation of his state, and urging suicide as  the readiest mode to put an end to his sinful career. Amid his errors,  the pleasure he had taken in prolonging his journey unnecessarily, and  the attention which he had bestowed on the beauty of the fair female when  his thoughts ought to have been dedicated to the religious discourse of  her father, were set before him in the darkest colours; and he was  treated as one who, having sinned against light, was therefore deservedly  left a prey to the Prince of Darkness.    As the fated and influential hour rolled on, the terrors of the hateful  Presence grew more confounding to the mortal senses of the victim, and  the knot of the accursed sophistry became more inextricable in  appearance, at least to the prey whom its meshes surrounded. He had not  power to explain the assurance of pardon which he continued to assert, or  to name the victorious name in which he trusted. But his faith did not  abandon him, though he lacked for a time the power of expressing it. 'Say  what you will,' was his answer to the Tempter; 'I know there is as much  betwixt the two boards of this Book as can ensure me forgiveness for my  transgressions and safety for my soul.' As he spoke, the clock, which  announced the lapse of the fatal hour, was heard to strike. The speech  and intellectual powers of the youth were instantly and fully restored;  he burst forth into prayer, and expressed in the most glowing terms his  reliance on the truth and on the Author of the Gospel. The Demon retired,  yelling and discomfited, and the old man, entering the apartment, with  tears congratulated his guest on his victory in the fated struggle.    The young man was afterwards married to the beautiful maiden, the first  sight of whom had made such an impression on him, and they were consigned  over at the close of the story to domestic happiness. So ended John  MacKinlay's legend.    The Author of Waverley had imagined a possibility of framing an  interesting, and perhaps not an unedifying, tale out of the incidents of  the life of a doomed individual, whose efforts at good and virtuous  conduct were to be for ever disappointed by the intervention, as it were,  of some malevolent being, and who was at last to come off victorious from  the fearful struggle. In short, something was meditated upon a plan  resembling the imaginative tale of Sintram and his Companions, by Mons.  le Baron de la Motte Fouque, although, if it then existed, the author had  not seen it.    The scheme projected may be traced in the three or four first chapters of  the work; but farther consideration induced the author to lay his purpose  aside. It appeared, on mature consideration, that astrology, though its  influence was once received and admitted by Bacon himself, does not now  retain influence over the general mind sufficient even to constitute the  mainspring of a romance. Besides, it occurred that to do justice to such  a subject would have required not only more talent than the Author could  be conscious of possessing, but also involved doctrines and discussions  of a nature too serious for his purpose and for the character of the  narrative. In changing his plan, however, which was done in the course of  printing, the early sheets retained the vestiges of the original tenor of  the story, although they now hang upon it as an unnecessary and unnatural  incumbrance. The cause of such vestiges occurring is now explained and  apologised for.    It is here worthy of observation that, while the astrological doctrines  have fallen into general contempt, and been supplanted by superstitions  of a more gross and far less beautiful character, they have, even in  modern days, retained some votaries.    One of the most remarkable believers in that forgotten and despised  science was a late eminent professor of the art of legerdemain. One would  have thought that a person of this description ought, from his knowledge  of the thousand ways in which human eyes could be deceived, to have been  less than others subject to the fantasies of superstition.
