This speech was welcomed with even greater  enthusiasm than the other, the warriors rushing down to the shore to  launch away. Aghast at the coming failure of the enterprise Athena  stirred up Odysseus to check the mad impulse. Taking from Agamemnon his  royal sceptre as the sign of authority, he pleaded with chieftains  and their warriors, telling them that it was not for them to know the  counsel in the hearts of Kings.        \"We are not all Kings to bear rule here. 'Tis not good to have many      Lords; let there be one Lord, one King, to whom the crooked-counselling      son of Cronos hath given the rule.\"    Thus did Odysseus stop the flight, bringing to reason all save  Thersites, \"whose heart was full of much unseemly wit, who talked rashly  and unruly, striving with Kings, saying what he deemed would make the  Achaeans smile\".    He continued his chatter, bidding the Greeks persist in their homeward  flight. Knowing that argument with such an one was vain, Odysseus laid  his sceptre across his back with such heartiness that a fiery weal  started up beneath the stroke. The host praised the act, the best of the  many good deeds that Odysseus had done before Troy.    When the Assembly was stilled, Odysseus and Nestor and Agamemnon told  the plan of action; the dream bade them arm for a mighty conflict,  for the end could not be far off, the ten years' siege that had been  prophesied being all but completed. The names of the various chieftains  and the numbers of their ships are found in the famous catalogue, a  document which the Greeks treasured as evidence of united action against  a common foe. With equal eagerness the Trojans poured from their town  commanded by Hector; their host too has received from Homer the glory of  an everlasting memory in a detailed catalogue.    Literary skill of a high order has brought upon the scene as quickly as  possible the chief figures of the poem. When the armies were about  to meet, Paris, seeing Menelaus whom he had wronged, shrank from the  combat. On being upbraided by Hector who called him \"a joy to his  foes and a disgrace to himself\", Paris was stung to an act of courage.  Hector's heart was as unwearied as an axe, his spirit knew not fear; yet  beauty too was a gift of the gods, not to be cast away. Let him be set  to fight Menelaus in single combat for Helen and her wealth; let an oath  be made between the two armies to abide by the result of the fight,  that both peoples might end the war and live in peace. Overjoyed,  Hector called to the Greeks telling them of Paris' offer, which Menelaus  accepted. The armies sat down to witness the fight, while Hector sent to  Troy to fetch Priam to ratify the treaty.    In Troy the elders were seated on the wall to watch the conflict, Priam  among them. Warned by Iris, Helen came forth to witness the single  combat. As she moved among them the elders bore their testimony to her  beauty; its nature is suggested but not described, for the poet felt he  was unable to paint her as she was.        \"Little wonder,\" they exclaimed, \"that the Trojans and Achaeans      should suffer woe for many a year for such a woman. She is marvellous      like the goddesses to behold; yet albeit she is so fair let her depart      in the ships, leaving us and our little ones no trouble to come.\"    Seeing her, Priam bade her sit by him and tell the names of the Greek  leaders as they passed before his eyes. Agamemnon she knew by his royal  bearing, Odysseus who moved along the ranks like a ram she marked out  as the master of craft and deep counsel. Hearing her words, Antenor bore  his witness to their truth, for once Odysseus had come with Menelaus to  Troy on an embassy.        \"When they stood up Menelaus was taller, when they sat down Odysseus      was more stately. But when they spake, Menelaus' words were fluent,      clear but few; Odysseus when he spoke, fixed his eyes on the ground,      turning his sceptre neither backwards nor forward, standing still      like a man devoid of wit; one would have deemed him a churl and a very      fool; yet when he sent forth his mighty voice from his breast in words      as many as the snowflakes, no other man could compare with him.\"    Helen pointed out Ajax and Idomeneus and others, yet could not see her  two brothers, Castor and Pollux; either they had not come from her home  in Sparta, or they had refused to fight, fearing the shame and reproach  of her name. \"So she spake, yet the life-giving earth covered them  there, even in Sparta, their native land.\"    When the news came to Priam of the combat arranged between Paris and  Menelaus, the old King shuddered for his son, yet he went out to confirm  the compact. Feeling he could not look upon the fight, he returned to  the city. Meanwhile Hector had cast lots to decide which of the two  should first hurl his spear. Paris failed to wound his enemy, but  Menelaus' dart pierced Paris' armour; he followed it up with a blow of  his sword which shivered to pieces in his hand. He then caught Paris'  helmet and dragged him off towards the Greek army; but Aphrodite saved  her favourite, for she loosed the chin-strap and bore Paris back to  Helen in Troy. Menelaus in vain looked for him among the Trojans who  were fain to see an end of him, \"and would not have hidden him if  they had seen him\". Agamemnon then declared his brother the victor and  demanded the fulfilment of the treaty.    Such an end to the siege did not content Hera, whose anger against the  Trojans was such that she could have \"devoured raw Priam and his sons\".  With Zeus' consent she sent down Pallas Athena to confound the treaty.  Descending like some brilliant and baleful star the goddess assumed the  shape of Laodocus and sought out the archer Pandarus. Him she tempted  to shoot privily at Menelaus to gain the favour of Paris. While his  companions held their shields in front of him the archer launched a  shaft at his victim, but Athena turned it aside so that it merely grazed  his body, drawing blood. Seeing his brother wounded Agamemnon ran to  him, to prophesy the certain doom of the treaty breakers.        \"Not in vain did we shed the blood of compact and offer the pledges      of a treaty. Though Zeus hath not fulfilled it now, yet he will at      last and they will pay dear with their lives, they, their wives and      children. Well I know in my heart that the day will come when sacred      Troy will perish and Priam and his folk; Zeus himself throned on high      dwelling in the clear sky will shake against them all his dark aegis      in anger for this deceit.\"    While the leeches drew out the arrow from the wound, Agamemnon went  round the host with words of encouragement or chiding to stir them up  to the righteous conflict. They rushed on to battle to be met by the  Trojans whose host        \"knew not one voice or one speech; their language was mixed, for they      were men called from many lands.\"    In the fight Diomedes, though at first wounded by Pandarus, speedily  returned refreshed and strengthened by Athena. His great deeds drew upon  him Pandarus and Aeneas, the son of Aphrodite and the future founder  of Rome's greatness. Diomedes quickly slew Pandarus and when Aeneas  bestrode his friend's body, hurled at him a mighty stone which laid him  low. Afraid of her son Aphrodite cast her arms about him and shrouded  him in her robe. Knowing that she was but a weak goddess Diomedes  attacked her, wounding her in the hand. Dropping her son, she fled  to Ares who was watching the battle and besought him to lend her his  chariot, wherein she fled back to Olympus. There her mother Dione  comforted her with the story of the woes which other gods had suffered  from mortals.        \"But this man hath been set upon thee by Athena. Foolish one, he      knoweth not in his heart that no man liveth long who fighteth with      the gods; no children lisp 'father' at his knees when he returneth      from war and dread conflict. Therefore, albeit he is so mighty, let      him take heed lest a better than thou meet him, for one day his      prudent wife shall wail in her sleep awaking all her house, bereft      of her lord, the best man of the Achaeans.\"    But Athena in irony deemed that Aphrodite had been scratched by some  Greek woman whom she caressed to tempt her to forsake her husband and  follow one of the Trojans she loved.    Aeneas when dropped by his mother had been picked up by Apollo; when  Diomedes attacked the god, he was warned that battle with an immortal  was not like man's warfare. Stirred by Apollo, Ares himself came to  the aid of the Trojans, inspiring Sarpedon the Lycian to hearten his  comrades, who were shortly gladdened by the return of Aeneas whom Apollo  had healed. At the sight of Ares and Apollo fighting for Troy Hera and  Athena came down to battle for the Greeks; they found Diomedes on the  skirts of the host, cooling the wound Pandarus had inflicted. Entering  his chariot by his side, Athena fired him to meet Ares and drive him  wounded back to Olympus, where he found but little compassion from Zeus.  The two goddesses then left the mortals to fight it out.    At this moment Helenus, the prophetic brother of Hector, bade him go to  Troy to try to appease the anger of Athena by an offering, in the hope  that Diomedes' progress might be stayed. In his absence Diomedes met in  the battle Glaucus, a Lycian prince.        \"Who art thou?\" he asked. \"I have never seen thee before in battle,      yet now thou hast gone far beyond all others in hardihood, for thou      hast awaited my onset, and they are hapless whose sons meet my      strength. If thou art a god, I will not fight with thee; but if thou      art one of those who eat the fruit of the earth, come near, that      thou mayest the quicker get thee to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8129"],[0,"A Dreamer's Tales (#2)"],[1,"s, and she would go  up into the wild woods unattended and come back with her robes unseemly  and all torn, and would not take reproof with a humble spirit, but made  grimaces even in my marble court all set about with fountains.\"    Then said the King of Toldees:    \"Let us watch more closely and let us see the Princess Hilnaric in the  season of the orchard-bloom when the great birds go by that know the Sea,  to rest in our inland places; and if she be more beautiful than the  sunrise over our folded kingdoms when all the orchards bloom, it may be  that she is more beautiful than the Sea.\"    And the King of Arizim said:    \"I fear this is terrible blasphemy, yet will I do as you have decided in  council.\"    And the season of the orchard-bloom appeared. One night the King of Arizim  called his daughter forth on his outer balcony of marble. And the moon was  rising huge and round and holy over dark woods, and all the fountains were  singing to the night. And the moon touched the marble palace gables, and  they glowed in the land. And the moon touched the heads of all the  fountains, and the grey columns broke into fairy lights. And the moon left  the dark ways of the forest and lit the whole white palace and its  fountains and shone on the forehead of the Princess, and the palace of  Arizim glowed afar, and the fountains became columns of gleaming jewels  and song. And the moon made a music at its rising, but it fell a little  short of mortal ears. And Hilnaric stood there wondering, clad in white,  with the moonlight shining on her forehead; and watching her from the  shadows on the terrace stood the kings of Mondath and Toldees. They said.    \"She is more beautiful than the moonrise.\" And the season of the  orchard-bloom appeared. One night the King of Arizim called his daughter  forth on his outer balcony of marble.

And  Hilnaric stood there wondering, clad in white, with the moonlight shining  on her forehead; and watching her from the shadows on the terrace stood  the kings of Mondath and Toldees. They said:    \"She is more beautiful than the moonrise.\" And on another day the King of  Arizim bade his daughter forth at dawn, and they stood again upon the  balcony. And the sun came up over a world of orchards, and the sea-mists  went back over Poltarnees to the Sea; little wild voices arose in all the  thickets, the voices of the fountains began to die, and the song arose, in  all the marble temples, of the birds that are sacred to the Sea. And  Hilnaric stood there, still glowing with dreams of heaven.    \"She is more beautiful,\" said the kings, \"than morning.\"    Yet one more trial they made of Hilnaric's beauty, for they watched her on  the terraces at sunset ere yet the petals of the orchards had fallen, and  all along the edge of neighbouring woods the rhododendron was blooming  with the azalea. And the sun went down under craggy Poltarnees, and the  sea-mist poured over his summit inland. And the marble temples stood up  clear in the evening, but films of twilight were drawn between the  mountain and the city. Then from the Temple ledges and eaves of palaces  the bats fell headlong downwards, then spread their wings and floated up  and down through darkening ways; lights came blinking out in golden  windows, men cloaked themselves against the grey sea-mist, the sound of  small songs arose, and the face of Hilnaric became a resting-place for  mysteries and dreams.    \"Than all these things,\" said the kings, \"she is more lovely: but who can  say whether she is lovelier than the Sea?\"    Prone in a rhododendron thicket at the edge of the palace lawns a hunter  had waited since the sun went down. Near to him was a deep pool where the  hyacinths grew and strange flowers floated upon it with broad leaves; and  there the great bull gariachs came down to drink by starlight; and,  waiting there for the gariachs to come, he saw the white form of the  Princess leaning on her balcony. Before the stars shone out or the bulls  came down to drink he left his lurking-place and moved closer to the  palace to see more nearly the Princess. The palace lawns were full of  untrodden dew, and everything was still when he came across them, holding  his great spear. In the farthest corner of the terraces the three old  kings were discussing the beauty of Hilnaric and the destiny of the Inner  Lands. Moving lightly, with a hunter's tread, the watcher by the pool came  very near, even in the still evening, before the Princess saw him. When he  saw her closely he exclaimed suddenly:    \"She must be more beautiful than the Sea.\"    When the Princess turned and saw his garb and his great spear she knew  that he was a hunter of gariachs.    When the three kings heard the young man exclaim they said softly to one  another:    \"This must be the man.\"    Then they revealed themselves to him, and spoke to him to try him. They  said:    \"Sir, you have spoken blasphemy against the Sea.\"    And the young man muttered:    \"She is more beautiful than the Sea.\"    And the kings said:    \"We are older than you and wiser, and know that nothing is more beautiful  than the Sea.\"    And the young man took off the gear of his head, and became downcast, and  he knew that he spake with kings, yet he answered:    \"By this spear, she is more beautiful than the Sea.\"    And all the while the Princess stared at him, knowing him to be a hunter  of gariachs.    Then the king of Arizim said to the watcher by the pool:    \"If thou wilt go up Poltarnees and come back, as none have come, and  report to us what lure or magic is in the Sea, we will pardon thy  blasphemy, and thou shalt have the Princess to wife and sit among the  Council of Kings.\"    And gladly thereunto the young man consented. And the Princess spoke to  him, and asked him his name. And he told her that his name was Athelvok,  and great joy arose in him at the sound of her voice. And to the three  kings he promised to set out on the third day to scale the slope of  Poltarnees and to return again, and this was the oath by which they bound  him to return:    \"I swear by the Sea that bears the worlds away, by the river of Oriathon,  which men call Ocean, and by the gods and their tiger, and by the doom of  the worlds, that I will return again to the Inner Lands, having beheld the  Sea.\"    And that oath he swore with solemnity that very night in one of the  temples of the Sea, but the three kings trusted more to the beauty of  Hilnaric even than to the power of the oath.    The next day Athelvok came to the palace of Arizim with the morning, over  the fields to the East and out of the country of Toldees, and Hilnaric  came out along her balcony and met him on the terraces. And she asked him  if he had ever slain a gariach, and he said that he had slain three, and  then he told her how he had killed his first down by the pool in the wood.  For he had taken his father's spear and gone down to the edge of the pool,  and had lain under the azaleas there waiting for the stars to shine, by  whose first light the gariachs go to the pools to drink; and he had gone  too early and had had long to wait, and the passing hours seemed longer  than they were. And all the birds came in that home at night, and the bat  was abroad, and the hour of the duck went by, and still no gariach came  down to the pool; and Athelvok felt sure that none would come. And just as  this grew to a certainty in his mind the thicket parted noiselessly and a  huge bull gariach stood facing him on the edge of the water, and his great  horns swept out sideways from his head, and at the ends curved upwards,  and were four strides in width from tip to tip. And he had not seen  Athelvok, for the great bull was on the far side of the little pool, and  Athelvok could not creep round to him for fear of meeting the wind (for  the gariachs, who can see little in the dark forests, rely on hearing and  smell). But he devised swiftly in his mind while the bull stood there with  head erect just twenty strides from him across the water. And the bull  sniffed the wind cautiously and listened, then lowered his great head down  to the pool and drank. At that instant Athelvok leapt into the water and  shot forward through its weedy depths among the stems of the strange  flowers that floated upon broad leaves on the surface. And Athelvok kept  his spear out straight before him, and the fingers of his left hand he  held rigid and straight, not pointing upwards, and so did not come to the  surface, but was carried onward by the strength of his spring and passed  unentangled through the stems of the flowers. When Athelvok jumped into  the water the bull must have thrown his head up, startled at the splash,  then he would have listened and have sniffed the air, and neither hearing  nor scenting any danger he must have remained rigid for some moments, for  it was in that attitude that Athelvok found him as he emerged breathless  at his feet. And, striking at once, Athelvok drove the spear into his  throat before the head and the terrible horns came down. But Athelvok had  clung to one of the great horns, and had been carried at terrible speed  through the rhododendron bushes until the gariach fell, but rose at once  again, and died standing up, still struggling, drowned in its own blood.    But to Hilnaric listening it was as though one of the"]]]
