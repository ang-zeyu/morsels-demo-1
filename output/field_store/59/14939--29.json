Those things alone  Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,  None else, for none are terrible beside.  I am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!  That any suff'rance of your misery  Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire  Assails me.  In high heaven a blessed dame  Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief  That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,  That God's stern judgment to her will inclines.\"  To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:  \"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid  And I commend him to thee.\"  At her word  Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,  And coming to the place, where I abode  Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,  She thus address'd me: \"Thou true praise of God!  Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent  To him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave  For thy sake all the multitude admires?  Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,  Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,  Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?\"  \"Ne'er among men did any with such speed  Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,  As when these words were spoken, I came here,  Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force  Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all  Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings.\"    \"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes  Tearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt  Redoubled zeal to serve thee.  As she will'd,  Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,  Who thy near way across the goodly mount  Prevented.  What is this comes o'er thee then?  Why, why dost thou hang back?  why in thy breast  Harbour vile fear?  why hast not courage there  And noble daring?  Since three maids so blest  Thy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;  And so much certain good my words forebode.\"    As florets, by the frosty air of night  Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,  Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;  So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,  And to my heart such kindly courage ran,  That I as one undaunted soon replied:  \"O full of pity she, who undertook  My succour! and thou kind who didst perform  So soon her true behest!  With such desire  Thou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,  That my first purpose fully is resum'd.  Lead on: one only will is in us both.  Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.\"    So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,  I enter'd on the deep and woody way.          CANTO III    \"THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:  Through me you pass into eternal pain:  Through me among the people lost for aye.  Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:  To rear me was the task of power divine,  Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.  Before me things create were none, save things  Eternal, and eternal I endure.    \"All hope abandon ye who enter here.\"    Such characters in colour dim I mark'd  Over a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:  Whereat I thus: \"Master, these words import  Hard meaning.\"  He as one prepar'd replied:  \"Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;  Here be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come  Where I have told thee we shall see the souls  To misery doom'd, who intellectual good  Have lost.\"  And when his hand he had stretch'd forth  To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd,  Into that secret place he led me on.    Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans  Resounded through the air pierc'd by no star,  That e'en I wept at entering.  Various tongues,  Horrible languages, outcries of woe,  Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,  With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,  Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls  Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd,  Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.    I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:  \"O master!  What is this I hear?  What race  Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?\"    He thus to me: \"This miserable fate  Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv'd  Without or praise or blame, with that ill band  Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd  Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves  Were only.  From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,  Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth  Of Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe  Should glory thence with exultation vain.\"    I then: \"Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,  That they lament so loud?\"  He straight replied:  \"That will I tell thee briefly.  These of death  No hope may entertain: and their blind life  So meanly passes, that all other lots  They envy.  Fame of them the world hath none,  Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.  Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.\"    And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,  Which whirling ran around so rapidly,  That it no pause obtain'd: and following came  Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er  Have thought, that death so many had despoil'd.    When some of these I recogniz'd, I saw  And knew the shade of him, who to base fear  Yielding, abjur'd his high estate.  Forthwith  I understood for certain this the tribe  Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing  And to his foes.  These wretches, who ne'er lived,  Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung  By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks  With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,  And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.    Then looking farther onwards I beheld  A throng upon the shore of a great stream:  Whereat I thus: \"Sir! grant me now to know  Whom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem  So eager to pass o'er, as I discern  Through the blear light?\"  He thus to me in few:  \"This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive  Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.\"    Then with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame,  Fearing my words offensive to his ear,  Till we had reach'd the river, I from speech  Abstain'd.  And lo! toward us in a bark  Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,    Crying, \"Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not  Ever to see the sky again.  I come  To take you to the other shore across,  Into eternal darkness, there to dwell  In fierce heat and in ice.  And thou, who there  Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave  These who are dead.\"  But soon as he beheld  I left them not, \"By other way,\" said he,  \"By other haven shalt thou come to shore,  Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat  Must carry.\"  Then to him thus spake my guide:  \"Charon! thyself torment not: so 't is will'd,  Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.\"    Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks  Of him the boatman o'er the livid lake,  Around whose eyes glar'd wheeling flames.  Meanwhile  Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang'd,  And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words  They heard.  God and their parents they blasphem'd,  The human kind, the place, the time, and seed  That did engender them and give them birth.    Then all together sorely wailing drew  To the curs'd strand, that every man must pass  Who fears not God.  Charon, demoniac form,  With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,  Beck'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar  Strikes.  As fall off the light autumnal leaves,  One still another following, till the bough  Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;    E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood  Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,  Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.    Thus go they over through the umber'd wave,  And ever they on the opposing bank  Be landed, on this side another throng  Still gathers.  \"Son,\" thus spake the courteous guide,  \"Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,  All here together come from every clime,  And to o'erpass the river are not loth:  For so heaven's justice goads them on, that fear  Is turn'd into desire.  Hence ne'er hath past  Good spirit.  If of thee Charon complain,  Now mayst thou know the import of his words.\"    This said, the gloomy region trembling shook  So terribly, that yet with clammy dews  Fear chills my brow.  The sad earth gave a blast,  That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,  Which all my senses conquer'd quite, and I  Down dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seiz'd.          CANTO IV    BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash  Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,  As one by main force rous'd.  Risen upright,  My rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd  With fixed ken to know what place it was,  Wherein I stood.  For certain on the brink  I found me of the lamentable vale,  The dread abyss, that joins a thund'rous sound  Of plaints innumerable.  Dark and deep,  And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain  Explor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern.    \"Now let us to the blind world there beneath  Descend;\" the bard began all pale of look:  \"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.\"    Then I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:  \"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,  Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?\"    He then: \"The anguish of that race below  With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear  Mistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way  Urges to haste.\"  Onward, this said, he mov'd;  And ent'ring led me with him on the bounds  Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.  Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard  Except of sighs, that made th' eternal air  Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief  Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,  Of men, women, and infants.  Then to me  The gentle guide: \"Inquir'st thou not what spirits  Are these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass  Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin  Were blameless; and if aught they merited,  It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,  The portal to thy faith.  If they before  The Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;  And among such am I. For these defects,  And for no other evil, we are lost;\"    \"Only so far afflicted, that we live  Desiring without hope.\"  So grief assail'd  My heart at hearing this,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#2)"],[1,": \"Thee as in my mortal frame  I lov'd, so loos'd forth it I love thee still,  And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?\"    \"Not without purpose once more to return,  Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am  Journeying this way;\" I said, \"but how of thee  Hath so much time been lost?\"  He answer'd straight:  \"No outrage hath been done to me, if he  Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft  This passage hath denied, since of just will  His will he makes.  These three months past indeed,  He, whose chose to enter, with free leave  Hath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore  Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind  Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which  His wings are pointed, for there always throng  All such as not to Archeron descend.\"    Then I: \"If new laws have not quite destroy'd  Memory and use of that sweet song of love,  That while all my cares had power to 'swage;  Please thee with it a little to console  My spirit, that incumber'd with its frame,  Travelling so far, of pain is overcome.\"    \"Love that discourses in my thoughts.\"  He then  Began in such soft accents, that within  The sweetness thrills me yet.  My gentle guide  And all who came with him, so well were pleas'd,  That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.    Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes  We stood, when lo! that old man venerable  Exclaiming, \"How is this, ye tardy spirits?  What negligence detains you loit'ring here?  Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,  That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.\"    As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food  Collected, blade or tares, without their pride  Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,  If aught alarm them, suddenly desert  Their meal, assail'd by more important care;  So I that new-come troop beheld, the song  Deserting, hasten to the mountain's side,  As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.    Nor with less hurried step did we depart.          CANTO III    Them sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,  Turn'd tow'rds the mountain, whither reason's voice  Drives us; I to my faithful company  Adhering, left it not.  For how of him  Depriv'd, might I have sped, or who beside  Would o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps  He with the bitter pang of self-remorse  Seem'd smitten.  O clear conscience and upright  How doth a little fling wound thee sore!    Soon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),  From haste, that mars all decency of act,  My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,  Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:  And full against the steep ascent I set  My face, where highest to heav'n its top o'erflows.    The sun, that flar'd behind, with ruddy beam  Before my form was broken; for in me  His rays resistance met.  I turn'd aside  With fear of being left, when I beheld  Only before myself the ground obscur'd.  When thus my solace, turning him around,  Bespake me kindly: \"Why distrustest thou?  Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?  It now is evening there, where buried lies  The body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd  To Naples from Brundusium's wall.  Nor thou  Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,  More than that in the sky element  One ray obstructs not other.  To endure  Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames  That virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works  Wills not to us should be reveal'd.  Insane  Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,  Which holds three persons in one substance knit.  Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;  Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been  For Mary to bring forth.  Moreover ye  Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;  To whose desires repose would have been giv'n,  That now but serve them for eternal grief.  I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,  And others many more.\"  And then he bent  Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood  Broke off his speech.  Meanwhile we had arriv'd  Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock  Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps  To climb it had been vain.  The most remote  Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract  'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this  A ladder easy' and open of access.    \"Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?\"  My master said and paus'd, \"so that he may  Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?\"  And while with looks directed to the ground  The meaning of the pathway he explor'd,  And I gaz'd upward round the stony height,  Of spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,  Yet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd.    I thus my guide address'd: \"Upraise thine eyes,  Lo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain  Counsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not!\"    Straightway he look'd, and with free speech replied:  \"Let us tend thither: they but softly come.  And thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd.\"    Now was that people distant far in space  A thousand paces behind ours, as much  As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,  When all drew backward on the messy crags  Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd  As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.    \"O spirits perfect!  O already chosen!\"  Virgil to them began, \"by that blest peace,  Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,  Instruct us where the mountain low declines,  So that attempt to mount it be not vain.  For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.\"    As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,  Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest  Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose  To ground, and what the foremost does, that do  The others, gath'ring round her, if she stops,  Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;  So saw I moving to advance the first,  Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,  Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.  When they before me had beheld the light  From my right side fall broken on the ground,  So that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd  And somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,  Who follow'd, though unweeting of the cause.    \"Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,  This is a human body which ye see.  That the sun's light is broken on the ground,  Marvel not: but believe, that not without  Virtue deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb  Over this wall aspire.\"  So them bespake  My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;  \"Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,\"  Making a signal to us with bent hands.    Then of them one began.  \"Whoe'er thou art,  Who journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn,  Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.\"    I tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld.  Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,  He seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd.    When humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld  Him ever: \"Now behold!\"  he said, and show'd  High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.    \"I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen  Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return'd,  To my fair daughter go, the parent glad  Of Aragonia and Sicilia's pride;  And of the truth inform her, if of me  Aught else be told.  When by two mortal blows  My frame was shatter'd, I betook myself  Weeping to him, who of free will forgives.  My sins were horrible; but so wide arms  Hath goodness infinite, that it receives  All who turn to it.  Had this text divine  Been of Cosenza's shepherd better scann'd,  Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,  Yet at the bridge's head my bones had lain,  Near Benevento, by the heavy mole  Protected; but the rain now drenches them,  And the wind drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,  Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights  Extinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed.  Yet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,  But that the eternal love may turn, while hope  Retains her verdant blossoms.  True it is,  That such one as in contumacy dies  Against the holy church, though he repent,  Must wander thirty-fold for all the time  In his presumption past; if such decree  Be not by prayers of good men shorter made  Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;  Revealing to my good Costanza, how  Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms  Laid on me of that interdict; for here  By means of those below much profit comes.\"          CANTO IV    When by sensations of delight or pain,  That any of our faculties hath seiz'd,  Entire the soul collects herself, it seems  She is intent upon that power alone,  And thus the error is disprov'd which holds  The soul not singly lighted in the breast.  And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,  That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn'd,  Time passes, and a man perceives it not.  For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,  Another that, which the whole spirit hash;  This is as it were bound, while that is free.    This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit  And wond'ring; for full fifty steps aloft  The sun had measur'd unobserv'd of me,  When we arriv'd where all with one accord  The spirits shouted, \"Here is what ye ask.\"    A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp'd  With forked stake of thorn by villager,  When the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,  By which my guide, and I behind him close,  Ascended solitary, when that troop  Departing left us.  On Sanleo's road  Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,  Or mounts Bismantua's height, must use his feet;  But here a man had need to fly, I mean  With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,  Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,  And with light furnish'd to direct my way.    We through the broken rock ascended, close  Pent on each side, while underneath the ground  Ask'd help of hands and feet.  When we arriv'd  Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,  Where the plain level open'd I exclaim'd,  \"O master! say which way can we proceed?\"    He answer'd, \"Let no step of thine recede.  Behind me gain the mountain, till to us  Some practis'd guide appear.\"  That eminence  Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,  And the side proudly rising, more than line  From the mid quadrant to"]]]
