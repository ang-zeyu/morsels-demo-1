Cape Leewin is called after this vessel. Pelsart left  two convicts on the Australian coast in 1629. Carpenter was the next  navigator, and all these adventurers have indelibly affixed their  names to portions of the coast of the land they discovered. The next,  and a greater than these, at least greater in his navigating  successes, was Abel Janz Tasman, in 1642. Tasman was instructed to  inquire from the native inhabitants for Pelsart's two convicts, and to  bring them away with him, IF THEY ENTREATED HIM; but they were never  heard of again. Tasman sailed round a great portion of the Australian  coast, discovered what he named Van Diemen's land, now Tasmania, and  New Zealand. He it was who called the whole, believing it to be one,  New Holland, after the land of his birth. Next we have Dampier, an  English buccaneer--though the name sounds very like Dutch; it was  probably by chance only that he and his roving crew visited these  shores. Then came Wilhelm Vlaming with three ships. God save the mark  to call such things ships. How the men performed the feats they did,  wandering over vast and unknown oceans, visiting unknown coasts with  iron-bound shores, beset with sunken reefs, subsisting on food not fit  for human beings, suffering from scurvy caused by salted diet and  rotten biscuit, with a short allowance of water, in torrid zones, and  liable to be attacked and killed by hostile natives, it is difficult  for us to conceive. They suffered all the hardships it is possible to  imagine upon the sea, and for what? for fame, for glory? That their  names and achievements might be handed down to us; and this seems to  have been their only reward; for there was no Geographical Society's  medal in those days with its motto to spur them on.    Vlaming was the discoverer of the Swan River, upon which the seaport  town of Fremantle and the picturesque city of Perth, in Western  Australia, now stand. This river he discovered in 1697, and he was the  first who saw Dirk Hartog's tin plate.    Dampier's report of the regions he had visited caused him to be sent  out again in 1710 by the British Government, and upon his return, all  previous doubts, if any existed, as to the reality of the existence of  this continent, were dispelled, and the position of its western shores  was well established. Dampier discovered a beautiful flower of the pea  family known as the Clianthus Dampierii. In 1845 Captain Sturt found  the same flower on his Central Australian expedition, and it is now  generally known as Sturt's Desert Pea, but it is properly named in its  botanical classification, after its original discoverer.    After Dampier's discoveries, something like sixty years elapsed before  Cook appeared upon the scene, and it was not until his return to  England that practical results seemed likely to accrue to any nation  from the far-off land. I shall not recapitulate Cook's voyages; the  first fitted out by the British Government was made in 1768, but Cook  did not touch upon Australia's coast until two years later, when,  voyaging northwards along the eastern coast, he anchored at a spot he  called Botany Bay, from the brightness and abundance of the beautiful  wild flowers he found growing there. Here two natives attempted to  prevent his landing, although the boats were manned with forty men.  The natives threw stones and spears at the invaders, but nobody was  killed. At this remote and previously unvisited spot one of the crew  named Forby Sutherland, who had died on board the Endeavour, was  buried, his being the first white man's grave ever dug upon  Australia's shore; at least the first authenticated one--for might not  the remaining one of the two unfortunate convicts left by Pelsart have  dug a grave for his companion who was the first to die, no man  remaining to bury the survivor? Cook's route on this voyage was along  the eastern coast from Cape Howe in south latitude 37 degrees 30' to  Cape York in Torres Straits in latitude 10 degrees 40'. He called the  country New South Wales, from its fancied resemblance to that older  land, and he took possession of the whole in the name of George III as  England's territory.    Cook reported so favourably of the regions he had discovered that the  British Government decided to establish a colony there; the spot  finally selected was at Port Jackson, and the settlement was called  Sydney in 1788. After Cook came the Frenchman Du Fresne and his  unfortunate countryman, La Perouse. Then Vancouver, Blyth, and the  French General and Admiral, D'Entre-Casteaux, who went in search of  the missing La Perouse. In 1826, Captain Dillon, an English navigator,  found the stranded remains of La Perouse's ships at two of the  Charlotte Islands group. We now come to another great English  navigator, Matthew Flinders, who was the first to circumnavigate  Australia; to him belongs the honour of having given to this great  island continent the name it now bears. In 1798, Flinders and Bass,  sailing in an open boat from Sydney, discovered that Australia and Van  Diemen's Land were separate; the dividing straits between were then  named after Bass. In 1802, during his second voyage in the  Investigator, a vessel about the size of a modern ship's launch,  Flinders had with him as a midshipman John Franklin, afterwards the  celebrated Arctic navigator. On his return to England, Flinders,  touching at the Isle of France, was made prisoner by the French  governor and detained for nearly seven years, during which time a  French navigator Nicolas Baudin, with whom came Perron and Lacepede  the naturalists, and whom Flinders had met at a part of the southern  coast which he called Encounter Bay in reference to that meeting,  claimed and reaped the honour and reward of a great portion of the  unfortunate prisoner's work. Alas for human hopes and aspirations,  this gallant sailor died before his merits could be acknowledged or  rewarded, and I believe one or two of his sisters were, until very  lately, living in the very poorest circumstances.    The name of Flinders is, however, held in greater veneration than any  of his predecessors or successors, for no part of the Australian coast  was unvisited by him. Rivers, mountain ranges, parks, districts,  counties, and electoral divisions, have all been named after him; and,  indeed, I may say the same of Cook; but, his work being mostly  confined to the eastern coast, the more western colonies are not so  intimately connected with his name, although an Australian poet has  called him the Columbus of our shore.    After Flinders and Baudin came another Frenchman, De Freycinet, bound  on a tour of discovery all over the world.    Australia's next navigator was Captain, subsequently Admiral, Philip  Parker King, who carried out four separate voyages of discovery,  mostly upon the northern coasts. At three places upon which King  favourably reported, namely Camden Harbour on the north-west coast,  Port Essington in Arnhem's Land, and Port Cockburn in Apsley Straits,  between Melville and Bathurst Islands on the north coast, military and  penal settlements were established, but from want of further  emigration these were abandoned. King completed a great amount of  marine surveying on these voyages, which occurred between the years  1813 and 1822.    Captain Wickham in the Beagle comes next; he discovered the Fitzroy  River, which he found emptied itself into a gulf named King's Sound.  In consequence of ill-health Captain Wickham, after but a short  sojourn on these shores, resigned his command, and Lieutenant Lort  Stokes, who had sailed with him in the Beagle round the rocky shores  of Magellan's Straits and Tierra del Fuego, received the command from  the Lords of the Admiralty. Captain Lort Stokes may be considered the  last, but by no means the least, of the Australian navigators. On one  occasion he was speared by natives of what he justly called Treachery  Bay, near the mouth of the Victoria River in Northern Australia,  discovered by him. His voyages occurred between the years 1839 and  1843. He discovered the mouths of most of the rivers that fall into  the Gulf of Carpentaria, besides many harbours, bays, estuaries, and  other geographical features upon the North Australian coasts.    The early navigators had to encounter much difficulty and many dangers  in their task of making surveys from the rough achievements of the  Dutch, down to the more finished work of Flinders, King and Stokes. It  is to be remembered that they came neither for pleasure nor for rest,  but to discover the gulfs, bays, peninsulas, mountains, rivers and  harbours, as well as to make acquaintance with the native races, the  soils, and animal and vegetable products of the great new land, so as  to diffuse the knowledge so gained for the benefit of others who might  come after them. In cockle-shells of little ships what dangers did  they not encounter from shipwreck on the sunken edges of coral ledges  of the new and shallow seas, how many were those who were never heard  of again; how many a little exploring bark with its adventurous crew  have been sunk in Australia's seas, while those poor wretches who  might, in times gone by, have landed upon the inhospitable shore would  certainly have been killed by the wild and savage hordes of hostile  aborigines, from whom there could be no escape! With Stokes the list  of those who have visited and benefited Australia by their labours  from the sea must close; my only regret being that so poor a  chronicler is giving an outline of their achievements. I now turn to  another kind of exploration--and have to narrate deeds of even greater  danger, though of a different kind, done upon Australia's face.    In giving a short account of those gallant men who have left  everlasting names "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#2)"],[1,"thence along the  telegraph line to Southern Cross; and indeed we did pass through York,  which thriving little town we left at dusk, and, carrying out our  directions, rode along the telegraph line. Unfortunately we had not been  told that the line split up, one branch going to Northam and the other to  Southern Cross; as often happens in such cases, we took the wrong branch  and travelled well into the night before finding any habitation at which  we could get food and water.    The owner of the house where we finally stopped did not look upon our  visit with pleasure, as we had literally to break into the house before we  could attract any attention. Finding we were not burglars, and having  relieved himself by most vigorous and pictorial language (in the use of  which the teamsters and small farmers are almost without rivals) the owner  showed us his well, and did what he could to make us comfortable. I shall  never forget the great hospitality here along this road, though no doubt  as time went on the settlers could not afford to house hungry travellers  free of cost, and probably made a fair amount of money by selling  provisions and horse-feed to the hundreds of gold-fever patients who were  continually passing.    Southern Cross, which came into existence about the year '90, was a pretty  busy place, being the last outpost of civilisation at the time of our  first acquaintance with it. The now familiar corrugated-iron-built town,  with its streets inches deep in dust under a blazing sun, its incessant  swarms of flies, the clashing of the \"stamps\" on the mines, and the  general \"never-never\" appearance of the place, impressed us with feelings  the reverse of pleasant. The building that struck me most was the bank--a  small iron shanty with a hession partition dividing it into office and  living room, the latter a hopeless chaos of cards, candle ends, whiskey  bottles, blankets, safe keys, gold specimens, and cooking utensils. The  bank manager had evidently been entertaining a little party of friends the  previous night, and though its hours had passed, and a new day had dawned,  the party still continued. Since that time it has been my lot to witness  more than one such evening of festivity!    On leaving Southern Cross we travelled with another company of  adventurers, one of whom, Mr. Davies, an old Queensland squatter, was our  partner in several subsequent undertakings.    The monotony of the flat timber-clad country was occasionally relieved by  the occurrence of large isolated hills of bare granite. But for these the  road, except for camels, could never have been kept open; for they  represented our sources of water supply. On the surface of the rocks  numerous holes and indentations are found, which after rain, hold water,  and besides these, around the foot of the outcrops, \"soaks,\" or shallow  wells, are to be found.    What scenes of bitter quarrels these watering-places have witnessed!  The selfish striving, each to help himself, the awful sufferings of man  and beast, horses and camels mad with thirst, and men cursing the country  and themselves, for wasting their lives and strength in it; but they have  witnessed many an act of kindness and self-denial too.    Where the now prosperous and busy town of Coolgardie stands, with its  stone and brick buildings, banks, hotels, and streets of shops, offices,  and dwelling-houses, with a population of some 15,000, at the time of  which I write there stood an open forest of eucalyptus dotted here and  there with the white tents and camps of diggers. A part of the timber had  already been cleared to admit of \"dry-blowing\" operations--a process  adopted for the separation of gold from alluvial soil in the waterless  parts of Australia.    Desperate hard work this, with the thermometer at 100 degrees in the  shade, with the \"dishes\" so hot that they had often to be put aside to  cool, with clouds of choking dust, a burning throat, and water at a  shilling to half a crown a gallon! Right enough for the lucky ones  \"on gold,\" and for them not a life of ease! The poor devil with neither  money nor luck, who looked into each dishful of dirt for the wherewithal  to live, and found it not, was indeed scarcely to be envied.    Water at this time was carted by horse-teams in waggons with large tanks  on board, or by camel caravans, from a distance of thirty-six miles, drawn  from a well near a large granite rock. The supply was daily failing, and  washing was out of the question; enough to drink was all one thought of;  two lines of eager men on either side of the track could daily be seen  waiting for these water-carts. What a wild rush ensued when they were  sighted! In a moment they were surrounded and taken by storm, men swarming  on to them like an army of ants. As a rule, eager as we were for water,  a sort of order prevailed, and every man got his gallon water-bag filled  until the supply was exhausted. And generally the owner of the water  received due payment.    About Christmas-time the water-famine was at its height. Notices were  posted by order of the Warden, proclaiming that the road to or from  Coolgardie would soon be closed, as all wells were failing, and advising  men to go down in small parties, and not to rush the waters in a great  crowd. This advice was not taken, and daily scores of men left the  \"field,\" and many were hard put to it to reach Southern Cross. It was a  cruel sight in those thirsty days to see the poor horses wandering about,  mere walking skeletons, deserted by their owners, for strangers were both  unable to give them water, and afraid to put them out of their misery lest  damages should be claimed against them. How long our own supplies would  last was eagerly discussed, as we gathered round the butcher's shop, the  great meeting-place, to which, in the evenings, most of the camp would  come to talk over the affairs of the day.    Postmaster, as well as butcher and storekeeper, was Mr. Benstead,  a kind-hearted, hard-working man, and a good friend to us in our early  struggles. What a wonderful post-office it was too! A proper match for the  so-called coach that brought the mails. A very dilapidated buckboard-buggy  drawn by equally dilapidated horses, used to do the journey from the  Southern Cross to the new fields very nearly as quickly as a loaded waggon  with eight or ten horses! The mail-coach used to carry not only letters,  papers, and gold on the return journey, but passengers, who served the  useful purposes of dragging the carriage through the sand and dust when  the horses collapsed, of hunting up the team in the mornings, and of  lightening the load by walking. For this exceedingly comfortable journey  they had the pleasure of paying at least five pounds. It was no uncommon  sight at some tank or rock on the road, to see the mail-coach standing  alone in its glory, deserted by driver and passengers alike. Of these some  would be horse-hunting, and the rest tramping ahead in hope of being  caught up by the coach. There would often be on board many hundred pounds'  worth of gold, sent down by the diggers to be banked, or forwarded to  their families; yet no instance of robbing the mail occurred. The sort of  gentry from whom bushrangers and thieves are made, had not yet found their  way to the rush.    Many banks were failing at that time, and men anxiously awaited the  arrival of news. The teamsters, with their heavy drays, would be eagerly  questioned as to where they had passed Her Majesty's mail, and as to the  probability of its arrival within the next week or so! The distribution of  letters did not follow this happy event with great rapidity. Volunteers  had to be called in to sort the delivery, the papers were thrown into a  heap in the road, and all anxious for news were politely requested to help  themselves. Several illustrated periodicals were regularly sent me from  home, as I learnt afterwards, but I never had the luck to drop across my  own paper!    On mail day, the date of which was most uncertain as the coach journeys  soon overlapped, there was always a lengthy, well-attended \"roll-up\" at  the Store. Here we first made acquaintance with Messrs. Browne and Lyon,  then negotiating for the purchase of Bayley's fabulous mine of gold.  No account of the richness of this claim at that time could be too  extravagant to be true; for surely such a solid mass of gold was never  seen before, as met the eye in the surface workings.    Messrs. Browne and Lyon had at their camp a small black-boy whom they  tried in vain to tame. He stood a good deal of misplaced kindness, and  even wore clothes without complaint; but he could not bear having his hair  cut, and so ran away to the bush. He belonged to the wandering tribe that  daily visited the camp--a tribe of wretched famine-stricken \"blacks,\"  whose natural hideousness and filthy appearance were intensified by the  dirty rags with which they made shift to cover their bodies. I should  never have conceived it possible that such living skeletons could exist.  Without begging from the diggers I fail to see how they could have lived,  for not a living thing was to be found in the bush, save an occasional  iguana and \"bardies,*\" and, as I have said, all known waters within  available distance of Coolgardie were dry, or nearly so.    [* \"Bardies\" are large white grubs--three or four inches long--which the  natives dig out from the roots of a certain shrub. When baked on  wood-ashes they are said to be excellent eating. The natives, however,  prefer them raw, and, having twisted off the heads, eat them with evident  relish.]    Benstead had managed to bring up a few sheep from the coast, which the  \"gins,\" or women, used to tend. The native camp was near the  slaughter-yard, and it used to be an interesting and charming sight to see  these wild children of the wilderness, fighting with their mongrel dogs  for the possession of the offal thrown away by"]]]
