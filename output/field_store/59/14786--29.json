[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53499"],[0,"Martin Luther (#2)"],[1,"peace  in a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God. Luther's efforts  were virtually the opposite. His every act was replete with  self-assertion directed toward winning merit. He tried the mystical way  of Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a  God whom he conceived to be an angry judge.    Luther's troubled spirit did not lower him in the vicar's estimation  and, perhaps to get his mind off it, Staupitz advised him to study for a  doctor's degree and assume the chair of Bible at the university. It was  good medicine, for thus the distressed monk came to closer grips with  the source book of his faith. So far, writings about the Bible, rather  than the book itself, had been his main diet. He studied for the degree  and preached in the monastery's rickety chapel until October 18-19,  1512, when he became Martin Luther, doctor of sacred scripture,  professor of Bible at Wittenberg University.                                   The Awakening    Since May, 1512, Luther had been subprior and regent in the school  connected with the Black Cloister at Wittenberg. In May, 1515, he became  district vicar for Thuringia and Meissen, having eleven monasteries  under his care. Meanwhile he was discharging his duties as professor in  the university.    Frequently the solution to great problems comes quite undramatically as  one goes about the daily tasks. Luther's awakening to a God who makes  man righteous in order to save him came in such a way. He knew the  teaching that the righteous shall be saved by faith. But who, he asked  himself, is righteous?    As he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries,  he gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that  grace could be earned. This, he found, was contrary to the New  Testament. Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not  make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man  righteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved. Out of this  came the doctrine of \"justification by faith.\"    At this point Luther still felt that he was in total agreement with the  teachings of the Roman Church. In a humble way he believed that he had  discovered for himself what always had been--that he had just been slow  in catching on. Deeper study, however, made it clear to him that there  was a great difference between his own and the theology of the middle  ages. He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his  salvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed  him and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ.  This indeed was not the work of an implacable judge, but of a loving  Father.    Luther now found himself rejecting most of the medieval writers and  teachers. He went back to the Bible, to Christ, and the apostles.  Convinced of the truth, he no longer was restrained by contradictory  views. His beliefs were contrary to many of the teachings of the church,  and while he didn't plan it that way they brought him into open revolt.  The matter of indulgences opened the battle.        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]          COLLISION WITH ROME                            The Question of Indulgences    The Roman Church taught that forgiveness of sins could be secured only  through the sacrament of penance. This required contrition of heart,  confession to a priest, and satisfaction by good works. Release from the  penalty of eternal punishment was guaranteed by the absolution  pronounced by the priest. If not enough works of penance were done  before death, however, the remainder had to be atoned for in the  torments of purgatory for an indefinite period.    Gradually a custom developed which permitted one to purchase indulgences  to offset purgatorial punishment. It was at this point that Luther's  theology conflicted with the church's practice. Grace was God's gift,  but indulgences implied that man can earn grace.    In 1515 the sale of indulgences was being pressed in the archbishopric  of Mainz which had been purchased recently by Albert of Brandenburg.  Because of the vast revenues the office controlled, it was a profitable  investment to become a bishop in those days. Although not old enough to  be a bishop, Albert already had procured two other sees before  negotiating for the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to  overlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats which  he needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.    Albert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg.  Then the pope granted him the privilege of selling indulgences so that  he could settle his account at the bank and at the same time raise  additional sums for St. Peter's.    John Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in  selling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's  parish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence  traffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered  for veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg. However, some of  Luther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel.  Luther saw the fundamental danger of the traffic when these folk  countered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him  indulgences remitting their sins. On October 31 Luther tacked a placard  on the door of the Castle Church. The sound of his hammer reached to  Rome.                               The Ninety-five Theses    The theses which Luther posted on the church door were not a declaration  of revolt. They were, after the custom of the day, an invitation to  theologians of Wittenberg and vicinity to debate on the indulgence  situation. So that all participants could be prepared, he posted the  ninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.    The points for argument did not call for abandonment of indulgences but  merely advocated the elimination of evils in the system. Luther  maintained, in his theses, that repentance should be a lifelong  experience and should manifest itself in a continuing effort to overcome  sinful desires. Indulgences, he said, are simply remissions of penalties  which the church has imposed. They have no effect on the souls of the  departed and they don't remit sin; only God can do that.    Luther believed he was being a loyal defender of the Roman Church by  attempting to correct these abuses, and correspondence revealed that he  thought the pope was unaware of what was going on. To his surprise the  theses released a great flood of favorable public opinion and were  applauded as a courageous and unrelenting attack. Within two weeks they  were distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany.    There had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the  pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own  national affairs. The theses now became a rallying point not only for  those who opposed Rome's continuous exploitation of German finances but  also for those who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power.  Even though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector  Frederick stood by his daring young monk.    As the Augustinians rallied around Luther, the Dominicans upheld the  cause of Brother Tetzel. He was granted a doctor's degree largely to  enable him to publish some theses of his own.    When the Tetzel writings came off press and were distributed, students  at Wittenberg collected a large quantity and held a public bonfire.  Luther, still a loyal son of the monastic system, was greatly displeased  by their sophomoric act.                                Rome Moves to Attack    Luther sent a copy of his theses to Albert of Brandenburg who forwarded  them to Rome where Pope Leo X reportedly brushed the incident off as a  row between rival monastic orders. Later the Dominicans charged Luther  with heresy and formal proceedings were begun. On August 7, 1518, Luther  received notice to appear in Rome for trial within sixty days.    By no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim  of a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy. He asked Elector  Frederick to have the trial transferred to German soil where he might at  least have the benefit of impartial judges.    On second thought the pope decided not to wait sixty days and ordered  the elector to arrest Luther at once and turn him over to Cardinal  Cajetan for delivery in Rome. Although Frederick was not sympathetic to  heresy he was determined that the man who had brought so much attention  to his university at Wittenberg should have fair play. He prevailed upon  the pope to have Cardinal Cajetan give Luther a personal hearing in  Augsburg where he would be attending a diet or parliament.    In a benign manner the cardinal offered to help Luther out of all his  difficulty if he would simply submit to the pope's authority and retract  his errors. Luther of course refused and tried to defend his positions.  A fruitless and oft-times heated controversy ensued and at the end of  three days Cajetan told Luther to leave his presence and not return  until he was ready to recant.    The cardinal was quite upset by the Augsburg incident and wrote Elector  Frederick a letter calling upon him to turn the heretical monk over to  the Roman authorities. Frederick's reply indicated his increasing  resistance to papal dictatorship. He asked for a free trial and a  statement of Luther's errors in writing.    The pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, was dispatched to Germany in  an attempt to rectify Cajetan's blundering. He correctly estimated that  much of the populace was on Luther's side and the time for forcibly  suppressing him was past. Resorting to diplomacy he persuaded Luther to  have his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further  attack in the meantime. Luther agreed, but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#2)"],[1,"u.\"   Khithânai-au-nù Mosâiâ fainaise; ângnî âfâkhô phongse    márichhe.
