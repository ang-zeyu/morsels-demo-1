Marcus "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7965"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#2)"],[1,"peak near the mountains of  Mainaka, while the Danavas were engaged in a sacrifice on the banks of  Vindu lake, I gathered a huge quantity of delightful and variegated  vanda (a kind of rough materials) composed of jewels and gems. This was  placed in the mansion of Vrishaparva ever devoted to truth. If it be  yet existing, I shall come back, O Bharata, with it. I shall then  commence the construction of the delightful palace of the Pandavas,  which is to be adorned with every kind of gems and celebrated all over  the world. There is also, I think, O thou of the Kuru race, a fierce  club placed in the lake Vindu by the King (of the Danavas) after  slaughtering therewith all his foes in battle. Besides being heavy and  strong and variegated with golden knobs, it is capable of bearing great  weight, and of slaying all foes, and is equal in strength unto an  hundred thousand clubs. It is a fit weapon for Bhima, even as the  Gandiva is for thee. There is also (in that lake) a large conch-shell  called Devadatta of loud sound, that came from Varuna. I shall no doubt  give all these to thee.' Having spoken thus unto Partha, the Asura went  away in a north-easterly direction. On the north of Kailasa in the  mountains of Mainaka, there is a huge peak of gems and jewels called  Hiranya-sringa. Near that peak is a delightful lake of the name of  Vindu. There, on its banks, previously dwelt king Bhagiratha for many  years, desiring to behold the goddess Ganga, since called Bhagirathee  after that king's name. And there, on its banks, O thou best of the  Bharatas, Indra the illustrious lord of every created thing, performed  one hundred great sacrifices. There, for the sake of beauty, though not  according to the dictates of the ordinance, were placed sacrificial  stakes made of gems and altars of gold. There, after performing those  sacrifices, the thousand-eyed lord of Sachi became crowned with  success. There the fierce Mahadeva, the eternal lord of every creature,  has taken up his abode after having created all the worlds and there he  dwelleth, worshipped with reverence by thousands of spirits. There Nara  and Narayana, Brahma and Yama and Sthanu the fifth, perform their  sacrifices at the expiration of a thousand yugas. There, for the  establishment of virtue and religion, Vasudeva, with pious devotion,  performed his sacrifices extending for many, many long years. There  were placed by Keshava thousands and tens of thousands of sacrificial  stakes adorned with golden garlands and altars of great splendour.  Going thither, O Bharata, Maya brought back the club and the  conch-shell and the various crystalline articles that had belonged to  king Vrishaparva. And the great Asura, Maya, having gone thither,  possessed himself of the whole of the great wealth which was guarded by  Yakshas and Rakshasas. Bringing them, the Asura constructed therewith a  peerless palace, which was of great beauty and of celestial make,  composed entirely of gems and precious stones, and celebrated  throughout the three worlds. He gave unto Bhimasena that best of clubs,  and unto Arjuna the most excellent conch-shell at whose sound all  creatures trembled in awe. And the palace that Maya built consisted of  columns of gold, and occupied, O monarch, an area of five thousand  cubits. The palace, possessing an exceedingly beautiful form, like unto  that of Agni or Suryya, or Soma, shone in great splendour, and by its  brilliance seemed to darken even the bright rays of the sun. And with  the effulgence it exhibited, which was a mixture of both celestial and  terrestrial light, it looked as if it was on fire. Like unto a mass of  new clouds conspicuous in the sky, the palace rose up coming into view  of all. Indeed, the palace that the dexterous Maya built was so wide,  delightful, and refreshing, and composed of such excellent materials,  and furnished with such golden walls and archways, and adorned with so  many varied pictures, and was withal so rich and well-built, that in  beauty it far surpassed Sudharma of the Dasarha race, or the mansion of  Brahma himself. And eight thousand Rakshasas called Kinkaras, fierce,  huge-bodied and endued with great strength, of red coppery eyes and  arrowy ears, well-armed and capable of ranging through the air, used to  guard and protect that palace. Within that palace Maya placed a  peerless tank, and in that tank were lotuses with leaves of  dark-coloured gems and stalks of bright jewels, and other flowers also  of golden leaves. And aquatic fowls of various species sported on its  bosom. Itself variegated with full-blown lotuses and stocked with  fishes and tortoises of golden hue, its bottom was without mud and its  water transparent. There was a flight of crystal stairs leading from  the banks to the edge of the water. The gentle breezes that swept along  its bosom softly shook the flowers that studded it. The banks of that  tank were overlaid with slabs of costly marble set with pearls. And  beholding that tank thus adorned all around with jewels and precious  stones, many kings that came there mistook it for land and fell into it  with eyes open. Many tall trees of various kinds were planted all  around the palace. Of green foliage and cool shade, and ever  blossoming, they were all very charming to behold. Artificial woods  were laid around, always emitting a delicious fragrance. And there were  many tanks also that were adorned with swans and Karandavas and  Chakravakas (Brahminy ducks) in the grounds lying about the mansion.  And the breeze bearing the fragrance of lotuses growing in water and  (of those growing on land) ministered unto the pleasure and happiness  of the Pandavas. And Maya having constructed such a palatial hall  within fourteen months, reported its completion unto Yudhishthira.\"      SECTION IV    Vaisampayana said,--\"Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered  that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with  preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey  with fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified  those superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food  seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti,  with rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of  meat--with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless  viands that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with  new and unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.  The king also gave unto each of those Brahmanas a thousand kine. And, O  Bharata, the voice of the gratified Brahmanas uttering,--'What an  auspicious day is this!' became so loud that it seemed to reach heaven  itself. And when the Kuru king entered the palatial sabha having also  worshipped the gods with various kinds of music and numerous species of  excellent and costly perfumes, the athletes and mimes and  prize-fighters and bards and encomiasts began to gratify that  illustrious son of Dharma by exhibiting their skill. And thus  celebrating his entry into the palace, Yudhishthira with his brothers  sported within that palace like Sakra himself in heaven. Upon the seats  in that palace sat, along with the Pandavas, Rishis and kings that came  from various countries, viz., Asita and Devala, Satya, Sarpamali and  Mahasira; Arvavasu, Sumitra, Maitreya, Sunaka and Vali; Vaka, Dalvya,  Sthulasira, Krishna-Dwaipayana, and Suka Sumanta, Jaimini, Paila, and  the disciples of Vyasa, viz., ourselves; Tittiri, Yajanavalkya, and  Lomaharshana with his son; Apsuhomya, Dhaumya, Animandavya; and  Kausika; Damoshnisha and Traivali, Parnada, and Varayanuka, Maunjayana,  Vayubhaksha, Parasarya, and Sarika; Valivaka, Silivaka, Satyapala, and  Krita-srama; Jatukarna, and Sikhavat.

And so also numerous  principal Kshatriyas, such as the illustrious and virtuous Mujaketu,  Vivarddhana, Sangramjit, Durmukha, the powerful Ugrasena; Kakshasena,  the lord of the Earth, Kshemaka the invincible; Kamatha, the king of  Kamvoja, and the mighty Kampana who alone made the Yavanas to ever  tremble at his name just as the god that wieldeth the thunder-bolt  maketh those Asuras, the Kalakeyas, tremble before him; Jatasura, and  the king of the Madrakas, Kunti, Pulinda the king of the Kiratas, and  the kings of Anga and Vanga, and Pandrya, and the king of Udhara, and  Andhaka; Sumitra, and Saivya that slayer of foes; Sumanas, the king of  the Kiratas, and Chanur the King of the Yavanas, Devarata, Bhoja, and  the so called Bhimaratha, Srutayudha--the king of Kalinga, Jayasena the  king of Magadha; and Sukarman, and Chekitana, and Puru that slayer of  foes; Ketumata, Vasudana, and Vaideha and Kritakshana: Sudharman,  Aniruddha, Srutayu endued with great strength; the invincible  Anuparaja, the handsome Karmajit; Sisupala with his son, the king of  Karusha; and the invincible youths of the Vrishni race, all equal in  beauty unto the celestials, viz., Ahuka, Viprithu, Sada, Sarana,  Akrura, Kritavarman, and Satyaka, the son of Sini; and Bhismaka,  Ankriti, and the powerful Dyumatsena, those chief of bowmen viz., the  Kaikeyas and Yajnasena of the Somaka race; these Kshatriyas endued with  great might, all well-armed and wealthy,"]]]
