It is in the state that that common seeking after  the good which is the profoundest truth about men and nature becomes  explicit and knows itself. The state is for Aristotle prior to the  family and the village, although it succeeds them in time, for only when  the state with its conscious organisation is reached can man understand  the secret of his past struggles after something he knew not what. If  primitive society is understood in the light of the state, the state is  understood in the light of its most perfect form, when the good after  which all societies are seeking is realised in its perfection. Hence for  Aristotle as for Plato, the natural state or the state as such is the  ideal state, and the ideal state is the starting-point of political  inquiry.    In accordance with the same line of thought, imperfect states, although  called perversions, are regarded by Aristotle as the result rather of  misconception and ignorance than of perverse will. They all represent,  he says, some kind of justice. Oligarchs and democrats go wrong in  their conception of the good. They have come short of the perfect state  through misunderstanding of the end or through ignorance of the proper  means to the end. But if they are states at all, they embody some common  conception of the good, some common aspirations of all their members.    The Greek doctrine that the essence of the state consists in community  of purpose is the counterpart of the notion often held in modern times  that the essence of the state is force. The existence of force is for  Plato and Aristotle a sign not of the state but of the state's failure.  It comes from the struggle between conflicting misconceptions of the  good. In so far as men conceive the good rightly they are united. The  state represents their common agreement, force their failure to make  that agreement complete. The cure, therefore, of political ills is  knowledge of the good life, and the statesman is he who has such  knowledge, for that alone can give men what they are always seeking.    If the state is the organisation of men seeking a common good, power and  political position must be given to those who can forward this end. This  is the principle expressed in Aristotle's account of political justice,  the principle of \"tools to those who can use them.\" As the aim of the  state is differently conceived, the qualifications for government  will vary. In the ideal state power will be given to the man with most  knowledge of the good; in other states to the men who are most truly  capable of achieving that end which the citizens have set themselves  to pursue. The justest distribution of political power is that in which  there is least waste of political ability.    Further, the belief that the constitution of a state is only the  outward expression of the common aspirations and beliefs of its members,  explains the paramount political importance which Aristotle assigns to  education. It is the great instrument by which the legislator can ensure  that the future citizens of his state will share those common beliefs  which make the state possible. The Greeks with their small states had  a far clearer apprehension than we can have of the dependence of a  constitution upon the people who have to work it.    Such is in brief the attitude in which Aristotle approaches political  problems, but in working out its application to men and institutions  as they are, Aristotle admits certain compromises which are not really  consistent with it.    1. Aristotle thinks of membership of a state as community in pursuit of  the good. He wishes to confine membership in it to those who are capable  of that pursuit in the highest and most explicit manner. His citizens,  therefore, must be men of leisure, capable of rational thought upon  the end of life. He does not recognise the significance of that less  conscious but deep-seated membership of the state which finds its  expression in loyalty and patriotism. His definition of citizen includes  only a small part of the population of any Greek city. He is forced to  admit that the state is not possible without the co-operation of men  whom he will not admit to membership in it, either because they are not  capable of sufficient rational appreciation of political ends, like the  barbarians whom he thought were natural slaves, or because the leisure  necessary for citizenship can only be gained by the work of the artisans  who by that very work make themselves incapable of the life which  they make possible for others. \"The artisan only attains excellence  in proportion as he becomes a slave,\" and the slave is only a living  instrument of the good life. He exists for the state, but the state does  not exist for him.    2. Aristotle in his account of the ideal state seems to waver between  two ideals. There is the ideal of an aristocracy and the ideal of what  he calls constitutional government, a mixed constitution. The principle  of \"tools to those who can use them\" ought to lead him, as it does  Plato, to an aristocracy. Those who have complete knowledge of the good  must be few, and therefore Plato gave entire power in his state into  the hands of the small minority of philosopher guardians. It is in  accordance with this principle that Aristotle holds that kingship is  the proper form of government when there is in the state one man of  transcendent virtue. At the same time, Aristotle always holds that  absolute government is not properly political, that government is not  like the rule of a shepherd over his sheep, but the rule of equals  over equals. He admits that the democrats are right in insisting that  equality is a necessary element in the state, though he thinks they do  not admit the importance of other equally necessary elements. Hence he  comes to say that ruling and being ruled over by turns is an essential  feature of constitutional government, which he admits as an alternative  to aristocracy. The end of the state, which is to be the standard of the  distribution of political power, is conceived sometimes as a good for  the apprehension and attainment of which \"virtue\" is necessary and  sufficient (this is the principle of aristocracy), and sometimes as a  more complex good, which needs for its attainment not only \"virtue\" but  wealth and equality. This latter conception is the principle on which  the mixed constitution is based. This in its distribution of political  power gives some weight to \"virtue,\" some to wealth, and some to mere  number. But the principle of \"ruling and being ruled by turns\" is not  really compatible with an unmodified principle of \"tools to those who  can use them.\" Aristotle is right in seeing that political government  demands equality, not in the sense that all members of the state should  be equal in ability or should have equal power, but in the sense that  none of them can properly be regarded simply as tools with which the  legislator works, that each has a right to say what will be made of his  own life. The analogy between the legislator and the craftsman on which  Plato insists, breaks down because the legislator is dealing with men  like himself, men who can to some extent conceive their own end in life  and cannot be treated merely as means to the end of the legislator. The  sense of the value of \"ruling and being ruled in turn\" is derived from  the experience that the ruler may use his power to subordinate the  lives of the citizens of the state not to the common good but to his  own private purposes. In modern terms, it is a simple, rough-and-ready  attempt to solve that constant problem of politics, how efficient  government is to be combined with popular control. This problem arises  from the imperfection of human nature, apparent in rulers as well as in  ruled, and if the principle which attempts to solve it be admitted as a  principle of importance in the formation of the best constitution, then  the starting-point of politics will be man's actual imperfection, not  his ideal nature. Instead, then, of beginning with a state which would  express man's ideal nature, and adapting it as well as may be to man's  actual shortcomings from that ideal, we must recognise that the state  and all political machinery are as much the expression of man's weakness  as of his ideal possibilities. The state is possible only because  men have common aspirations, but government, and political power, the  existence of officials who are given authority to act in the name of the  whole state, are necessary because men's community is imperfect, because  man's social nature expresses itself in conflicting ways, in the clash  of interests, the rivalry of parties, and the struggle of classes,  instead of in the united seeking after a common good. Plato and  Aristotle were familiar with the legislator who was called in by the  whole people, and they tended therefore to take the general will or  common consent of the people for granted. Most political questions are  concerned with the construction and expression of the general will, and  with attempts to ensure that the political machinery made to express the  general will shall not be exploited for private or sectional ends.    Aristotle's mixed constitution springs from a recognition of sectional  interests in the state. For the proper relation between the claims of  \"virtue,\" wealth, and numbers is to be based not upon their relative  importance in the good life, but upon the strength of the parties which  they represent. The mixed constitution is practicable in a state where  the middle class is strong, as only the middle class can mediate between  the rich and the poor. The mixed constitution will be stable if it  represents the actual balance of power between different classes in the  state. When we come to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763"],[0,"Aristotle on the art of poetry (#2)"],[1,"a deed of strife or disaster is more  tragic when it occurs 'amid affections' or 'among people who love each  other', no doubt the phrase, as Aristotle's own examples show, would  primarily suggest to a Greek feuds between near relations. Yet some of  the meaning is lost if one translates simply 'within the family'.    There is another series of obscurities or confusions in the _Poetics_  which, unless I am mistaken, arises from the fact that Aristotle was  writing at a time when the great age of Greek tragedy was long past, and  was using language formed in previous generations. The words and phrases  remained in the tradition, but the forms of art and activity which they  denoted had sometimes changed in the interval. If we date the _Poetics_  about the year 330 B.C., as seems probable, that is more than two  hundred years after the first tragedy of Thespis was produced in Athens,  and more than seventy after the death of the last great masters of  the tragic stage. When we remember that a training in music and poetry  formed a prominent part of the education of every wellborn Athenian,  we cannot be surprised at finding in Aristotle, and to a less extent in  Plato, considerable traces of a tradition of technical language and even  of aesthetic theory.    It is doubtless one of Aristotle's great services that he conceived  so clearly the truth that literature is a thing that grows and has a  history. But no writer, certainly no ancient writer, is always vigilant.  Sometimes Aristotle analyses his terms, but very often he takes them for  granted; and in the latter case, I think, he is sometimes deceived by  them. Thus there seem to be cases where he has been affected in his  conceptions of fifth-century tragedy by the practice of his own day,  when the only living form of drama was the New Comedy.    For example, as we have noticed above, true Tragedy had always taken its  material from the sacred myths, or heroic sagas, which to the classical  Greek constituted history. But the New Comedy was in the habit of  inventing its plots. Consequently Aristotle falls into using the word  _mythos_ practically in the sense of 'plot', and writing otherwise in a  way that is unsuited to the tragedy of the fifth century. He says that  tragedy adheres to 'the historical names' for an aesthetic reason,  because what has happened is obviously possible and therefore  convincing. The real reason was that the drama and the myth were simply  two different expressions of the same religious kernel (p. 44). Again,  he says of the Chorus (p. 65) that it should be an integral part of the  play, which is true; but he also says that it' should be regarded as one  of the actors', which shows to what an extent the Chorus in his day  was dead and its technique forgotten. He had lost the sense of what the  Chorus was in the hands of the great masters, say in the Bacchae or the  Eumenides. He mistakes, again, the use of that epiphany of a God which  is frequent at the end of the single plays of Euripides, and which seems  to have been equally so at the end of the trilogies of Aeschylus. Having  lost the living tradition, he sees neither the ritual origin nor the  dramatic value of these divine epiphanies. He thinks of the convenient  gods and abstractions who sometimes spoke the prologues of the New  Comedy, and imagines that the God appears in order to unravel the plot.  As a matter of fact, in one play which he often quotes, the _Iphigenia  Taurica_, the plot is actually distorted at the very end in order to  give an opportunity for the epiphany.(1)    (1) See my _Euripides and his Age_, pp. 221-45.    One can see the effect of the tradition also in his treatment of the  terms Anagnorisis and Peripeteia, which Professor Bywater translates  as 'Discovery and Peripety' and Professor Butcher as 'Recognition and  Reversal of Fortune'. Aristotle assumes that these two elements are  normally present in any tragedy, except those which he calls 'simple';  we may say, roughly, in any tragedy that really has a plot. This strikes  a modern reader as a very arbitrary assumption. Reversals of Fortune  of some sort are perhaps usual in any varied plot, but surely not  Recognitions? The clue to the puzzle lies, it can scarcely be doubted,  in the historical origin of tragedy. Tragedy, according to Greek  tradition, is originally the ritual play of Dionysus, performed at his  festival, and representing, as Herodotus tells us, the 'sufferings'  or 'passion' of that God. We are never directly told what these  'sufferings' were which were so represented; but Herodotus remarks that  he found in Egypt a ritual that was 'in almost all points the same'. (1)  This was the well-known ritual of Osiris, in which the god was torn  in pieces, lamented, searched for, discovered or recognized, and the  mourning by a sudden Reversal turned into joy. In any tragedy which  still retained the stamp of its Dionysiac origin, this Discovery and  Peripety might normally be expected to occur, and to occur together. I  have tried to show elsewhere how many of our extant tragedies do, as a  matter of fact, show the marks of this ritual.(2)    (1) Cf. Hdt. ii. 48; cf. 42,144. The name of Dionysus must not be openly  mentioned in connexion with mourning (ib. 61, 132, 86). This may help to  explain the transference of the tragic shows to other heroes.    (2) In Miss Harrison's _Themis_, pp. 341-63.    I hope it is not rash to surmise that the much-debated word  __katharsis__, 'purification' or 'purgation', may have come into  Aristotle's mouth from the same source. It has all the appearance of  being an old word which is accepted and re-interpreted by Aristotle  rather than a word freely chosen by him to denote the exact phenomenon  he wishes to describe. At any rate the Dionysus ritual itself was a  _katharmos_ or _katharsis_--a purification of the community from the  taints and poisons of the past year, the old contagion of sin and death.  And the words of Aristotle's definition of tragedy in Chapter VI  might have been used in the days of Thespis in a much cruder and  less metaphorical sense. According to primitive ideas, the mimic  representation on the stage of 'incidents arousing pity and fear' did  act as a _katharsis_ of such 'passions' or 'sufferings' in real life.  (For the word _pathemata_ means 'sufferings' as well as 'passions'.)  It is worth remembering that in the year 361 B.C., during Aristotle's  lifetime, Greek tragedies were introduced into Rome, not on artistic but  on superstitious grounds, as a _katharmos_ against a pestilence (Livy  vii. 2). One cannot but suspect that in his account of the purpose  of tragedy Aristotle may be using an old traditional formula, and  consciously or unconsciously investing it with a new meaning, much as he  has done with the word _mythos_.    Apart from these historical causes of misunderstanding, a good teacher  who uses this book with a class will hardly fail to point out numerous  points on which two equally good Greek scholars may well differ in  the mere interpretation of the words. What, for instance, are the 'two  natural causes' in Chapter IV which have given birth to Poetry? Are  they, as our translator takes them, (1) that man is imitative, and (2)  that people delight in imitations? Or are they (1) that man is imitative  and people delight in imitations, and (2) the instinct for rhythm, as  Professor Butcher prefers? Is it a 'creature' a thousand miles long, or  a 'picture' a thousand miles long which raises some trouble in Chapter  VII? The word _zoon_ means equally 'picture' and 'animal'. Did the older  poets make their characters speak like 'statesmen', _politikoi_, or  merely like ordinary citizens, _politai_, while the moderns made theirs  like 'professors of rhetoric'? (Chapter VI, p. 38; cf. Margoliouth's  note and glossary).    It may seem as if the large uncertainties which we have indicated  detract in a ruinous manner from the value of the _Poetics_ to us as  a work of criticism. Certainly if any young writer took this book as  a manual of rules by which to 'commence poet', he would find himself  embarrassed. But, if the book is properly read, not as a dogmatic  text-book but as a first attempt, made by a man of astounding genius, to  build up in the region of creative art a rational order like that  which he established in logic, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics,  psychology, and almost every department of knowledge that existed in his  day, then the uncertainties become rather a help than a discouragement.  They give us occasion to think and use our imagination. They make us, to  the best of our powers, try really to follow and criticize closely the  bold gropings of an extraordinary thinker; and it is in this process,  and not in any mere collection of dogmatic results, that we shall find  the true value and beauty of the _Poetics_.    The book is of permanent value as a mere intellectual achievement; as  a store of information about Greek literature; and as an original or  first-hand statement of what we may call the classical view of  artistic criticism. It does not regard poetry as a matter of unanalysed  inspiration; it makes no concession to personal whims or fashion or  _ennui_. It tries by rational methods to find out what is good in art  and what makes it good, accepting the belief that there is just as truly  a good way, and many bad ways, in poetry as in morals or in playing  billiards. This is no place to try to sum up its main conclusions.  But it is characteristic of the classical view that Aristotle lays his  greatest stress, first, on the need for Unity in the work of art, the  need that each part should subserve the whole, while irrelevancies,  however brilliant in themselves, should be cast away; and next, on the  demand that great art must have for its subject the great way of living.  These judgements have often been misunderstood, but the truth in them is  profound and goes"]]]
