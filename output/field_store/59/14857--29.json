Well, I suppose I shall have to go.\"    \"I suppose you will,\" said Elsa mournfully. \"But, oh, Betty, what a  shame!\"          CHAPTER II    MERVO AND ITS OWNER      \"By heck!\" cried Mr. Benjamin Scobell.    He wheeled round from the window, and transferred his gaze from the  view to his sister Marion; losing by the action, for the view was a joy  to the eye, which his sister Marion was not.    Mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun. Mr. Scobell's  villa stood near the summit of the only hill the island possessed, and  from the window of the morning-room, where he had just finished  breakfast, he had an uninterrupted view of valley, town, and harbor--a  two-mile riot of green, gold and white, and beyond the white the blue  satin of the Mediterranean. Mr. Scobell did not read poetry except that  which advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested, or  he might have been reminded of the Island of Flowers in Tennyson's  \"Voyage of Maeldive.\" Violets, pinks, crocuses, yellow and purple  mesembryanthemum, lavender, myrtle, and rosemary ... his two-mile view  contained them all. The hillside below him was all aglow with the  yellow fire of the mimosa. But his was not one of those emotional  natures to which the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that  do often lie too deep for tears. A primrose by the river's brim a  simple primrose was to him--or not so much a simple primrose, perhaps,  as a basis for a possible Primrosina, the Soap that Really Cleans You.    He was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a Paradise: a  goblin in Fairyland. Somewhat below the middle height, he was lean of  body and vulturine of face. He had a greedy mouth, a hooked nose,  liquid green eyes and a sallow complexion. He was rarely seen without a  half-smoked cigar between his lips. This at intervals he would relight,  only to allow it to go out again; and when, after numerous fresh  starts, it had dwindled beyond the limits of convenience, he would  substitute another from the reserve supply that protruded from his  vest-pocket.           *       *       *       *       *    How Benjamin Scobell had discovered the existence of Mervo is not  known. It lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier. But  Mr. Scobell took a pride in the versatility of his finance. It  distinguished him from the uninspired who were content to concentrate  themselves on steel, wheat and such-like things. It was Mr. Scobell's  way to consider nothing as lying outside his sphere. In a financial  sense he might have taken Terence's _Nihil humanum alienum_ as his  motto. He was interested in innumerable enterprises, great and small.  He was the power behind a company which was endeavoring, without much  success, to extract gold from the mountains of North Wales, and another  which was trying, without any success at all, to do the same by sea  water. He owned a model farm in Indiana, and a weekly paper in New  York. He had financed patent medicines, patent foods, patent corks,  patent corkscrews, patent devices of all kinds, some profitable, some  the reverse.    Also--outside the ordinary gains of finance--he had expectations. He  was the only male relative of his aunt, the celebrated Mrs. Jane  Oakley, who lived in a cottage on Staten Island, and was reputed to  spend five hundred dollars a year--some said less--out of her snug  income of eighteen million. She was an unusual old lady in many ways,  and, unfortunately, unusually full of deep-rooted prejudices. The fear  lest he might inadvertently fall foul of these rarely ceased to haunt  Mr. Scobell.    This man of many projects had descended upon Mervo like a stone on the  surface of some quiet pool, bubbling over with modern enterprise in  general and, in particular, with a scheme. Before his arrival, Mervo  had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off  till to-morrow. The only really energetic thing it had ever done in its  whole history had been to expel his late highness, Prince Charles, and  change itself into a republic. And even that had been done with the  minimum of fuss. The Prince was away at the time. Indeed, he had been  away for nearly three years, the pleasures of Paris, London and Vienna  appealing to him more keenly than life among his subjects. Mervo,  having thought the matter over during these years, decided that it had  no further use for Prince Charles. Quite quietly, with none of that  vulgar brawling which its neighbor, France, had found necessary in  similar circumstances, it had struck his name off the pay-roll, and  declared itself a republic. The royalist party, headed by General  Poineau, had been distracted but impotent. The army, one hundred and  fifteen strong, had gone solid for the new regime, and that had settled  it. Mervo had then gone to sleep again. It was asleep when Mr. Scobell  found it.    The financier's scheme was first revealed to M. d'Orby, the President  of the Republic, a large, stout statesman with even more than the  average Mervian instinct for slumber. He was asleep in a chair on the  porch of his villa when Mr. Scobell paid his call, and it was not until  the financier's secretary, who attended the seance in the capacity of  interpreter, had rocked him vigorously from side to side for quite a  minute that he displayed any signs of animation beyond a snore like the  growling of distant thunder. When at length he opened his eyes, he  perceived the nightmare-like form of Mr. Scobell standing before him,  talking. The financier, impatient of delay, had begun to talk some  moments before the great awakening.    \"Sir,\" Mr. Scobell was saying, \"I gotta proposition to which I'd like  you to give your complete attention. Shake him some more, Crump. Sir,  there's big money in it for all of us, if you and your crowd'll sit in.  Money. _Lar' monnay_. No, that means change. What's money, Crump?  _Arjong_? There's _arjong_ in it, Squire. Get that? Oh, shucks!  Hand it to him in French, Crump.\"    Mr. Secretary Crump translated. The President blinked, and intimated  that he would hear more. Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar-stump, and  proceeded.    \"Say, you've heard of _Moosieer_ Blonk? Ask the old skeesicks if  he's ever heard of _Mersyaw_ Blonk, Crump, the feller who started  the gaming-tables at Monte Carlo.\"    Filtered through Mr. Crump, the question became intelligible to the  President. He said he had heard of M. Blanc. Mr. Crump caught the reply  and sent it on to Mr. Scobell, as the man on first base catches the  ball and throws it to second.    Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar.    \"Well, I'm in that line. I'm going to put this island on the map just  like old Doctor Blonk put Monte Carlo. I've been studying up all about  the old man, and I know just what he did and how he did it. Monte Carlo  was just such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit  it. The government was down to its last bean and wondering where the  Heck its next meal-ticket was coming from, when in blows Mr. Man, tucks  up his shirt-sleeves, and starts the tables. And after that the place  never looked back. You and your crowd gotta get together and pass a  vote to give me a gambling concession here, same as they did him.  Scobell's my name. Hand him that, Crump.\"    Mr. Crump obliged once more. A gleam of intelligence came into the  President's dull eye. He nodded once or twice. He talked volubly in  French to Mr. Crump, who responded in the same tongue.    \"The idea seems to strike him, sir,\" said Mr. Crump.    \"It ought to, if he isn't a clam,\" replied Mr. Scobell. He started to  relight his cigar, but after scorching the tip of his nose, bowed to  the inevitable and threw the relic away.    \"See here,\" he said, having bitten the end off the next in order; \"I've  thought this thing out from soup to nuts. There's heaps of room for  another Monte Carlo. Monte's a dandy place, but it's not perfect by a  long way. To start with, it's hilly. You have to take the elevator to  get to the Casino, and when you've gotten to the end of your roll and  want to soak your pearl pin, where's the hock-shop? Half a mile away up  the side of a mountain. It ain't right. In my Casino there's going to  be a resident pawnbroker inside the building, just off the main  entrance. That's only one of a heap of improvements. Another is that my  Casino's scheduled to be a home from home, a place you can be real cosy  in. You'll look around you, and the only thing you'll miss will be  mother's face. Yes, sir, there's no need for a gambling Casino to look  and feel and smell like the reading-room at the British Museum.  Comfort, coziness and convenience. That's the ticket I'm running on.  Slip that to the old gink, Crump.\"    A further outburst of the French language from Mr. Crump, supplemented  on the part of the \"old gink\" by gesticulations, interrupted the  proceedings.    \"What's he saying now?\" asked Mr. Scobell.    \"He wants to know--\"    \"Don't tell. Let me guess. He wants to know what sort of a rake-off he  and the other somnambulists will get--the darned old pirate! Is that  it?\"    Mr. Crump said that that was just it.    \"That'll be all right,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"Old man Blong's offer to the  Prince of Monaco was five hundred thousand francs a year--that's  somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in real money--and half the  profits made by the Casino. That's my offer, too. See how that hits  him, Crump.\"    Mr. Crump investigated.    \"He says he accepts gladly, on behalf of the Republic, sir,\" he  announced.    M. d'Orby confirmed the statement by rising, dodging the cigar, and  kissing Mr. Scobell on both cheeks.    \"Cut it out,\" said the financier austerely, breaking out of the clinch.  \"We'll take the Apache Dance as read. Good-by, Squire. Glad it's  settled. Now I can get busy.\"    He did. Workmen poured into Mervo, and in a very short time, dominating  the town and reducing to insignificance the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#2)"],[1,"up all over the land soon after the fifth century B.C.; regular  services of prayer with instruction in the Scriptures had been established  long before the Christian Era; the inward atonement had been preferred  to, or at least associated with, the outward rite before the outward  rite was torn away. It may be that, as Professor Burkitt has suggested,  the awful experiences of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the  Temple produced within Pharisaism a moral reformation which drove the Jew  within and thus spiritualised Judaism. For undoubtedly the Pharisee of the  Gospels is by no means the Pharisee as we meet him in the Jewish books.  There was always a latent power and tendency in Judaism towards inward  religion; and it may be that this power was intensified, this tendency  encouraged, by the loss of Temple and its Sacrificial rites.    But though the Temple had gone the Covenant remained. Not so much in  name as in essence. We do not hear much of the Covenant in the Rabbinic  books, but its spirit pervades Judaism. Of all the legacy of the past  the Covenant was the most inspiring element. Beginning with Abraham, the  Covenant established a special relation between God and Abraham's seed. 'I  have known him, that he may command his children and his household after  him, that they may keep the way of the Lord to do righteousness and  judgment' (Gen. xviii. 19). Of this Covenant, the outward sign was the  rite of circumcision. Renewed with Moses, and followed in traditional  opinion by the Ten Commandments, the Sinaitic Covenant was a further  link in the bond between God and His people. Of this Mosaic Covenant  the outward sign was the Sabbath. It is of no moment for our present  argument whether Abraham and Moses were historical persons or figments  of tradition. A Gamaliel would have as little doubted their reality as  would a St. Paul. And whatever Criticism may be doing with Abraham, it  is coming more and more to see that behind the eighth-century prophets  there must have towered the figure of a, if not of the traditional,  Moses; behind the prophets a, if not the, Law. Be that as it may, to the  Jew of the Christian Era, Abraham and Moses were real and the Covenant  unalterable. By the syncretism which has been already described Jeremiah's  New Covenant was not regarded as new. Nor was it new; it represented  a change of stress, not of contents. When he said (Jer. xxxi. 33),  'This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel, after  those days, saith the Lord; I will put my law in their inward parts, and  in their heart will I write it,' Jeremiah, it has been held, was making  Christianity possible. But he was also making Judaism possible. Here and  nowhere else is to be found the principle which enabled Judaism to survive  the loss of Temple and nationality. And the New Covenant was in no sense  inconsistent with the Old. For not only does Jeremiah proceed to add in  the self-same verse, 'I will be their God, and they will be my people,'  but the New Covenant is specifically made with the house of Judah and of  Israel, and it is associated with the permanence of the seed of Israel  as a separate people and with the Divine rebuilding of Jerusalem. The  Jew had no thought of analysing these verses into the words of the true  Jeremiah and those of his editors. The point is that over and above,  in complementary explanation of, the Abrahamic and Mosaic Covenants with  their external signs, over and above the Call of the Patriarch and the  Theophany of Sinai, was the Jeremian Covenant written in Israel's heart.    The Covenant conferred a distinction and imposed a duty. It was a bond  between a gracious God and a grateful Israel. It dignified history,  for it interpreted history in terms of providence and purpose; it  transfigured virtue by making virtue service; it was the salt of life,  for how could present degradation demoralise, seeing that God was  in it, to fulfil His part of the bond, to hold Israel as His jewel,  though Rome might despise? The Covenant made the Jew self-confident and  arrogant, but these very faults were needed to save him. It was his only  defence against the world's scorn. He forgot that the correlative of the  Covenant was Isaiah's 'Covenant-People'--missionary to the Gentiles and  the World. He relegated his world-mission (which Christianity and Islam  in part gloriously fulfilled) to a dim Messianic future, and was content  if in his own present he remained faithful to his mission to himself.    Above all, the legacy from the past came to Judaism hallowed and  humanised by all the experience of redemption and suffering which had  marked Israel's course in ages past, and was to mark his course in  ages to come. The Exodus, the Exile, the Maccabean heroism, the Roman  catastrophe; Prophet, Wise Man, Priest and Scribe,--all had left their  trace. Judaism was a religion based on a book and on a tradition; but  it was also a religion based on a unique experience. The book might  be misread, the tradition encumbered, but the experience was eternally  clear and inspiring. It shone through the Roman Diaspora as it afterwards  illuminated the Roman Ghetto, making the present tolerable by the memory  of the past and the hope of the future.        CHAPTER II    RELIGION AS LAW      The feature of Judaism which first attracts an outsider's attention, and  which claims a front place in this survey, is its 'Nomism' or 'Legalism.'  Life was placed under the control of Law. Not only morality, but religion  also, was codified. 'Nomism,' it has been truly said, 'has always  formed a fundamental trait of Judaism, one of whose chief aims has ever  been to mould life in all its varying relations according to the Law,  and to make obedience to the commandments a necessity and a custom'  (Lauterbach, _Jewish Encyclopedia_, ix. 326). Only the latest  development of Judaism is away from this direction. Individualism is  nowadays replacing the olden solidarity. Thus, at the Central Conference  of American Rabbis, held in July 1906 at Indianapolis, a project to  formulate a system of laws for modern use was promptly rejected. The  chief modern problem in Jewish life is just this: To what extent, and  in what manner, can Judaism still place itself under the reign of Law?    But for many centuries, certainly up to the French Revolution, Religion  as Law was the dominant conception in Judaism. Before examining the  validity of this conception a word is necessary as to the mode in which  it expressed itself. Conduct, social and individual, moral and ritual,  was regulated in the minutest details. As the Dayan M. Hyamson has  said, the maxim _De minimis non curat lex_ was not applicable to  the Jewish Law. This Law was a system of opinion and of practice and of  feeling in which the great principles of morality, the deepest concerns of  spiritual religion, the genuinely essential requirements of ritual, all  found a prominent place. To assert that Pharisaism included the small  and excluded the great, that it enforced rules and forgot principles,  that it exalted the letter and neglected the spirit, is a palpable libel.  Pharisaism was founded on God. On this foundation was erected a structure  which embraced the eternal principles of religion. But the system, it  must be added, went far beyond this. It held that there was a right and  a wrong way of doing things in themselves trivial. Prescription ruled  in a stupendous array of matters which other systems deliberately left to  the fancy, the judgment, the conscience of the individual. Law seized upon  the whole life, both in its inward experiences and outward manifestations.  Harnack characterises the system harshly enough. Christianity did not add  to Judaism, it subtracted. Expanding a famous epigram of Wellhausen's,  Harnack admits that everything taught in the Gospels 'was also to be  found in the Prophets, and even in the Jewish tradition of their time. The  Pharisees themselves were in possession of it; but, unfortunately, they  were in possession of much else besides. With them it was weighted,  darkened, distorted, rendered ineffective and deprived of its force by a  thousand things which they also held to be religious, and every whit as  important as mercy and judgment. They reduced everything into one fabric;  the good and holy was only one woof in a broad earthly warp' (_What  is Christianity?_ p. 47). It is necessary to qualify this judgment,  but it does bring out the all-pervadingness of Law in Judaism. 'And thou  shalt speak of them when thou sittest in thine house, when thou walkest by  the way, when thou liest down and when thou risest up' (Deut. vi. 7). The  Word of God was to occupy the Jew's thoughts constantly; in his daily  employment and during his manifold activities; when at work and when  at rest. And as a correlative, the Law must direct this complex life,  the Code must authorise action or forbid it, must turn the thoughts and  emotions in one direction and divert them from another.    Nothing in the history of religions can be cited as a complete parallel to  this. But incomplete parallels abound. A very large portion of all men's  lives is regulated from without: by the Bible and other sacred books; by  the institutions and rites of religion; by the law of the land; by the  imposed rules of accepted guides, poets, philosophers, physicians; and  above all by social conventions, current fashions, and popular maxims.  Only in the rarest case is an exceptional man the monstrosity which,  we are told, every Israelite was in the epoch of the Judges--a law  unto himself.    But in Judaism, until the period of modern reform, this fact of human  life was not merely an unconscious truism, it was consciously admitted.  And it was realised in a Code.    Or rather in a series of Codes. First came the _Mishnah_, a Code  compiled at about the year 200 A.D., but the result of a Pharisaic  activity extending"]]]
