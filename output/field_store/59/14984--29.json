Some of the enemy too, who had collected themselves into a  body, pursued our rear, and seized any of the baggage-cattle that were  unable to proceed, fighting with one another for the possession of them.  Such of the soldiers also as had lost their sight from the effects of  the snow, or had their toes mortified by the cold, were left behind. It  was found to be a relief to the eyes against the snow, if the soldiers  kept something black before them on the march, and to the feet, if they  kept constantly in motion, and allowed themselves no rest, and if they  took off their shoes in the night. But as to such as slept with their  shoes on, the straps worked into their feet, and the soles were frozen  about them, for when their old shoes had failed them, shoes of raw hides  had been made by the men themselves from the newly skinned oxen.    From such unavoidable sufferings some of the soldiers were left behind,  who, seeing a piece of ground of a black appearance, from the snow  having disappeared there, conjectured that it must have melted, and it  had in fact melted in the spot from the effect of a fountain, which was  sending up vapor in a wooded hollow close at hand. Turning aside  thither, they sat down and refused to proceed farther. Xenophon, who was  with the rear-guard, as soon as he heard this tried to prevail on them  by every art and means not to be left behind, telling them, at the same  time, that the enemy were collected and pursuing them in great numbers.  At last he grew angry, and they told him to kill them, as they were  quite unable to go forward. He then thought it the best course to strike  a terror, if possible, into the enemy that were behind, lest they should  fall upon the exhausted soldiers. It was now dark, and the enemy were  advancing with a great noise, quarrelling about the booty that they had  taken, when such of the rear-guard as were not disabled started up and  rushed toward them, while the tired men, shouting as loud as they could,  clashed their spears against their shields. The enemy, struck with  alarm, threw themselves among the snow into the hollow, and no one of  them afterward made himself heard from any quarter.    Xenophon and those with him, telling the sick men that a party should  come to their relief next day, proceeded on their march, but before they  had gone four _stadia_ they found other soldiers resting by the way in  the snow, and covered up with it, no guard being stationed over them.  They roused them up, but they said that the head of the army was not  moving forward. Xenophon, going past them and sending on some of the  ablest of the _peltasts_, ordered them to ascertain what it was that  hindered their progress. They brought word that the whole army was in  that manner taking rest. Xenophon and his men, therefore, stationing  such a guard as they could, took up their quarters there without fire or  supper. When it was near day, he sent the youngest of his men to the  sick, telling them to rouse them and oblige them to proceed. At this  juncture Chirisophus sent some of his people from the village to see how  the rear were faring. The young men were rejoiced to see them, and gave  them the sick to conduct to the camp, while they themselves went  forward, and, before they had gone twenty stadia, found themselves at  the village in which Chirisophus was quartered. When they came together,  it was thought safe enough to lodge the troops up and down in the  village. Chirisophus accordingly remained where he was, and the other  officers, appropriating by lot the several villages that they had in  sight, went to their respective quarters with their men.    Here Polycrates, an Athenian captain, requested leave of absence, and  taking with him the most active of his men, and hastening to the village  to which Xenophon had been allotted, surprised all the villagers and  their head man in their houses, together with seventeen colts that were  bred as a tribute for the king, and the head man's daughter, who had  been but nine days married; her husband was gone out to hunt hares, and  was not found in any of the villages. Their houses were underground, the  entrance like the mouth of a well, but spacious below; there were  passages dug into them for the cattle, but the people descended by  ladders. In the houses were goats, sheep, cows, and fowls, with their  young; all the cattle were kept on fodder within the walls.[29] There  were also wheat, barley, leguminous vegetables, and barley wine[30] in  large bowls; the grains of barley floated in it even with the brim of  the vessels, and reeds also lay in it, some larger and some smaller,  without joints; and these, when any one was thirsty, he was to take in  his mouth and suck.[31] The liquor was very strong, unless one mixed  water with it, and a very pleasant drink to those accustomed to it.    [Footnote 29: This description of a village on the Armenian uplands  applies itself to many that I visited in the present day. The descent by  wells is now rare, but is still to be met with; but in exposed and  elevated situations the houses are uniformly semi-subterraneous and  entered by as small an aperture as possible, to prevent the cold getting  in. Whatever the kind of cottage used, cows, sheep, goats, and fowls  participate with the family in the warmth and protection thereof.]    [Footnote 30: Something like our ale.]    [Footnote 31: The reeds were used, says Krueger, that none of the grains  of barley might be taken into the mouth.]    Xenophon made the chief man of his village sup with him, and told him to  be of good courage, assuring him that he should not be deprived of his  children, and that they would not go away without filling his house with  provisions in return for what they took, if he would but prove himself  the author of some service to the army till they should reach another  tribe. This he promised, and, to show his good-will, pointed out where  some wine[32] was buried. This night, therefore, the soldiers rested in  their several quarters in the midst of great abundance, setting a guard  over the chief, and keeping his children at the same time under their  eye. The following day Xenophon took the head man and went with him to  Chirisophus, and wherever he passed by a village he turned aside to  visit those who were quartered in it, and found them in all parts  feasting and enjoying themselves; nor would they anywhere let them go  till they had set refreshments before them; and they placed everywhere  upon the same table lamb, kid, pork, veal, and fowl, with plenty of  bread, both of wheat and barley. Whenever any person, to pay a  compliment, wished to drink to another, he took him to the large bowl,  where he had to stoop down and drink, sucking like an ox. The chief they  allowed to take whatever he pleased, but he accepted nothing from them;  where he found any of his relatives, however, he took them with him.    [Footnote 32: Xenophon seems to mean _grape_ wine, rather than to refer  to the barley wine just before mentioned, of which the taste does not  appear to have been much liked by the Greeks. Wine from grapes was not  made, it is probable, in these parts, on account of the cold, but Strabo  speaks of the fruit wine of Armenia Minor as not inferior to any of the  Greek wines.--_Schneider_.]    When they came to Chirisophus, they found his men also feasting in their  quarters, crowned with wreaths made of hay, and Armenian boys, in their  barbarian dress, waiting upon them, to whom they made signs what they  were to do as if they had been deaf and dumb. When Chirisophus and  Xenophon had saluted one another, they both asked the chief man, through  the interpreter who spoke the Persian language, what country it was. He  replied that it was Armenia. They then asked him for whom the horses  were bred, and he said that they were a tribute for the king, and added  that the neighboring country was that of Chalybes, and told them in what  direction the road lay. Xenophon then went away, conducting the chief  back to his family, giving him the horse that he had taken, which was  rather old, to fatten and offer in sacrifice (for he had heard that it  had been consecrated to the sun), being afraid, indeed, that it might  die, as it had been injured by the journey. He then took some of the  young horses, and gave one of them to each of the other generals and  captains. The horses in this country were smaller than those of Persia,  but far more spirited. The chief instructed the men to tie little bags  round the feet of the horses and other cattle when they drove them  through the snow, for without such bags they sunk up to their bellies.    When the eighth day was come, Xenophon committed the guide to  Chirisophus. He left the chief[33] all the members of his family, except  his son, a youth just coming to mature age; him he gave in charge to  Episthenes of Amphipolis, in order that if the father should conduct  them properly he might return home with him. At the same time they  carried to his house as many provisions as they could, and then broke up  their camp and resumed their march. The chief conducted them through the  snow, walking at liberty. When he came to the end of the third day's  march, Chirisophus was angry at him for not guiding them to some  villages. He said that there was none in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#20)"],[1,"regulation of quantities. The modern English  weights were adjusted by the 27th chapter of Magna Charta, or the great  charter forced, by the barons, from King John at Runnymede, in Surrey.  Therein it is declared that the weights, all over England, shall be the  same, although for different commodities there were two different kinds,  Troy and Avoirdupois. The origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat  gathered in the middle of an ear. The standard of measures was  originally kept at Winchester, and by a law of King Edgar was ordained  to be observed throughout the kingdom.    [Illustration: _Fig_. 19.]    [Illustration: _Fig_. 20.]        Fig. 19 is an ancient pair of common scales, with two basins and      a movable weight, which is made in the form of a head, covered      with the pileus, because Mercury had the weights and measures      under his superintendence. It is engraved on a stone in the      gallery of Florence. Fig. 20 represents a modern      weighing-machine, of great convenience, and generally in use in      those establishments where a great deal of cooking is carried      on.    71. ACCOMPANYING THE SCALES, or weighing-machines, there should be  spice-boxes, and sugar and biscuit-canisters of either white or japanned  tin. The covers of these should fit tightly, in order to exclude the  air, and if necessary, be lettered in front, to distinguish them. The  white metal of which they are usually composed, loses its colour when  exposed to the air, but undergoes no further change. It enters largely  into the composition of culinary utensils, many of them being entirely  composed of tinned sheet-iron; the inside of copper and iron vessels  also, being usually what is called _tinned_. This art consists of  covering any metal with a thin coating of tin; and it requires the metal  to be covered, to be perfectly clean and free from rust, and also that  the tin, itself, be purely metallic, and entirely cleared from all ashes  or refuse. Copper boilers, saucepans, and other kitchen utensils, are  tinned after they are manufactured, by being first made hot and the tin  rubbed on with resin. In this process, nothing ought to be used but pure  grain-tin. Lead, however, is sometimes mixed with that metal, not only  to make it lie more easily, but to adulterate it--a pernicious practice,  which in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of  food, cannot be too severely reprobated.--The following list, supplied  by Messrs. Richard & John Slack, 336, Strand, will show the articles  required for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life,  although it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary  for some families, and may contain more than are required for others. As  Messrs. Slack themselves, however, publish a useful illustrated  catalogue, which may be had at their establishment _gratis_, and which  it will be found advantageous to consult by those about to furnish, it  supersedes the necessity of our enlarging that which we give:--                                     s.  d.      1 Tea-kettle                   6   6    1 Toasting-fork                1   0    1 Bread-grater                 1   0    1 Pair of Brass Candlesticks   3   6    1 Teapot and Tray              6   6    1 Bottle-jack                  9   6    6 Spoons                       1   6    2 Candlesticks                 2   6    1 Candle-box                   1   4    6 Knives and Forks             5   3    2 Sets of Skewers              1   0    1 Meat-chopper                 1   9    1 Cinder-sifter                1   3    1 Coffee-pot                   2   3    1 Colander                     1   6    3 Block-tin Saucepans          5   9    5 Iron Saucepans              12   0    1 Ditto and Steamer            6   6    1 Large Boiling-pot           10   0    4 Iron Stewpans                8   9    1 Dripping-pan and Stand       6   6    1 Dustpan                      1   0    1 Fish and Egg-slice           1   9    2 Fish-kettles                10   0    1 Flour-box                    1   0    3 Flat-irons                   3   6    2 Frying-pans                  4   0    1 Gridiron                     2   0    1 Mustard-pot                  1   0    1 Salt-cellar                  0   8    1 Pepper-box                   0   6    1 Pair of Bellows              2   0    3 Jelly-moulds                 8   0    1 Plate-basket                 5   6    1 Cheese-toaster               1  10    1 Coal-shovel                  2   6    1 Wood Meat-screen            30   0      The Set                  L8   11   1      72. AS NOT ONLY HEALTH BUT LIFE may be said to depend on the cleanliness  of culinary utensils, great attention must be paid to their condition  generally, but more especially to that of the saucepans, stewpans, and  boilers. Inside they should be kept perfectly clean, and where an open  fire is used, the outside as clean as possible. With a Leamington range,  saucepans, stewpans, &c., can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot  on the outside, which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or  scullery-maid. Care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close,  so that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation.  They should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out, and should  always be bright on the upper rim, where they do not immediately come in  contact with the fire. Soup-pots and kettles should be washed  immediately After being used, and dried before the fire, and they should  be kept in a dry place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating  influence of rust, and, thereby, be destroyed. Copper utensils should  never be used in the kitchen unless tinned, and the utmost care should  be taken, not to let the tin be rubbed off. If by chance this should  occur, have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use.  Neither soup nor gravy should, at any time, be suffered to remain in  them longer than is absolutely necessary, as any fat or acid that is in  them, may affect the metal, so as to impregnate with poison what is  intended to be eaten. Stone and earthenware vessels should be provided  for soups and gravies not intended for immediate use, and, also, plenty  of common dishes for the larder, that the table-set may not be used for  such purposes. It is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour, when  they are apt to corrode glazed red-ware, and even metals, and  frequently, thereby, to become impregnated with poisonous particles. The  vinegar also in pickles, by its acidity, does the same. Consideration,  therefore, should be given to these facts, and great care also taken  that all _sieves, jelly-bags,_ and tapes for collared articles, be well  scalded and kept dry, or they will impart an unpleasant flavour when  next used. To all these directions the cook should pay great attention,  nor should they, by any means, be neglected by the _mistress of the  household_, who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives  health and happiness to home, whilst economy will immeasurably assist in  preserving them.    73. WITHOUT FUEL, A KITCHEN might be pronounced to be of little use;  therefore, to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the  means of domestic heat and comfort, has exercised the ingenuity of man.  Those now known have been divided into five classes; the first  comprehending the fluid inflammable bodies; the second, peat or turf;  the third, charcoal of wood; the fourth, pit-coal charred; and the  fifth, wood or pit-coal in a crude state, with the capacity of yielding  a copious and bright flame. The first may be said seldom to be employed  for the purposes of cookery; but _peat_, especially amongst rural  populations, has, in all ages, been regarded as an excellent fuel. It is  one of the most important productions of an alluvial soil, and belongs  to the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom. It may be described as  composed of wet, spongy black earth, held together by decayed  vegetables. Formerly it covered extensive tracts in England, but has  greatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement.  _Charcoal_ is a kind of artificial coal, used principally where a strong  and clear fire is desired. It is a black, brittle, insoluble, inodorous,  tasteless substance, and, when newly-made, possesses the remarkable  property of absorbing certain quantities of the different gases. Its  dust, when used as a polishing powder, gives great brilliancy to metals.  It consists of wood half-burned, and is manufactured by cutting pieces  of timber into nearly the same size, then disposing them in heaps, and  covering them with earth, so as to prevent communication with the air,  except when necessary to make them burn. When they have been  sufficiently charred, the fire is extinguished by stopping the vents  through which the air is admitted. Of _coal_ there are various species;  as, pit, culm, slate, cannel, Kilkenny, sulphurous, bovey, jet, &c.  These have all their specific differences, and are employed for various  purposes; but are all, more or less, used as fuel.        The use of coal for burning purposes was not known to the      Romans. In Britain it was discovered about fifty years before      the birth of Christ, in Lancashire, not tar from where      Manchester now stands; but for ages after its discovery, so long      as forests abounded, wood continued to be the fuel used for      firing. The first public notice of coal is in the reign of Henry      III., who, in 1272, granted a charter to the town of Newcastle,      permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal. It took some      centuries more, however, to bring it into common use, as this      did not take place till about the first quarter of the      seventeenth century, in the time of Charles I. A few years after      the Restoration, we find that about 200,000 chaldrons were      consumed in London. Although"]]]
