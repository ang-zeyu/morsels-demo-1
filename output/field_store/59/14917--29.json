It is helpful to note  that the English words \"mate, reign, pane, bend; meet, beat, feel, lady;  grow, loan, soft; mute, yes, mule\" (as pronounced in London and South of  England), would be written in Esperanto thus:--\"mejt, rejn, pejn, bend;  mijt, bijt, fijl, lejdi; groux, louxn, soft; mjut, jes, mjul\".                                     LESSON 1.                                     WORDS.    In Esperanto a word generally consists of an unchanging part or root,  which expresses the idea, and an ending which shows the use of the word,  that is, whether it is a name, a describing word, etc. By changing the  ending the use of the word is changed.    Notice carefully the words given below which end in \"o\". It will be seen  that they are all names.    In Esperanto every name ends in \"o\".    (In Grammar names are called NOUNS).    Notice further the words which end in \"-as.\" They all express doing or  being (action or state), which is going on at the present time, or which  is a custom at the present time.    The words \"a,\" \"an,\" are not expressed; \"the\" is translated by \"la\".

When the name (noun) is required to denote more than one of the persons  or things for which it stands, \"j\" is added to it, as \"rozoj\", roses;  \"kolomboj\", pigeons; and then every \"describing\" word (adjective) which  belongs to it must also have \"j\", as \"rugxaj rozoj\", red roses; \"la  kolomboj estas belaj\", the pigeons are beautiful.    (When the noun stands for \"more than one,\" it is said to be PLURAL. \"j\"  is the sign of the plural).

The house was empty. In the passage that led to the dining-room he  looked at the clock, and his heart turned a somersault. _It was five  minutes past nine._ Not only was he late for breakfast, but late  for school, too. Never before had he brought off the double event.    There was a little unpleasantness in his form room when he stole in at  seven minutes past the hour. Mr. Dexter, his form-master, never a  jolly sort of man to have dealings with, was rather bitter on the  subject.    \"You are incorrigibly lazy and unpunctual,\" said Mr. Dexter, towards  the end of the address. \"You will do me a hundred lines.\"    \"Oo-o-o, sir-r,\" said Chapple. But he felt at the time that it was not  much of a repartee. After dinner there was the usual interview with  Mr. Seymour.    \"You were late again this morning,\" he said.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Chapple.    \"Two hundred lines.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The thing was becoming monotonous.    Chapple pulled himself together. This must stop. He had said that  several times previously, but now he meant it. Nor poppy, nor  mandragora, nor all the drowsy syrups of the world should make him  oversleep himself again. This time he would try a combination of  schemes.    Before he went to bed that night he put his watch on half an hour,  wound it up, and placed it on a chair at his bedside. Then he seized  his rug and all the blankets except one, and tore them off. Then he  piled them in an untidy heap in the most distant corner of the room.  He meant to put temptation out of his reach. There should be no genial  warmth on this occasion.    Nor was there. He woke at six feeling as if he were one solid chunk of  ice. He put up with it in a torpid sort of way till seven. Then he  could stand it no longer. It would not be pleasant getting up and  going downstairs to the cheerless junior day-room, but it was the only  thing to do. He knew that if he once wrapped himself in the blankets  which stared at him invitingly from the opposite corner of the room,  he was lost. So he crawled out of bed, shivering, washed  unenthusiastically, and he proceeded to put on his clothes.    Downstairs it was more unpleasant than one would have believed  possible. The day-room was in its usual state of disorder. The fire  was not lit. There was a vague smell of apples. Life was very, very  grey. There seemed no brightness in it at all.    He sat down at the table and began once more the task of constructing  a handy model steam-engine, but he speedily realised, what he had  suspected before, that the instructions were the work of a dangerous  madman. What was the good of going on living when gibbering lunatics  were allowed to write for weekly papers?    About this time his gloom was deepened by the discovery that a tin  labelled mixed biscuits, which he had noticed in Brodie's locker, was  empty.    He thought he would go for a stroll. It would be beastly, of course,  but not so beastly as sitting in the junior day-room.    It is just here that the tragedy begins to deepen.    Passing out of Seymour's gate he met Brooke, of Appleby's. Brooke wore  an earnest, thoughtful expression.    \"Hullo, Brooke,\" said Chapple, \"where are you off to?\"    It seemed that Brooke was off to the carpenter's shop. Hence the  earnest, thoughtful expression. His mind was wrestling with certain  pieces of wood which he proposed to fashion into photograph frames.  There was always a steady demand in the school for photograph frames,  and the gifted were in the habit of turning here and there an honest  penny by means of them.    The artist soul is not always unfavourable to a gallery. Brooke said  he didn't mind if Chapple came along, only he wasn't to go rotting  about or anything. So Chapple went along.    Arrived at the carpenter's shop, Brooke was soon absorbed in his  labours. Chapple watched him for a time with the interest of a  brother-worker, for had he not tried to construct handy model  steam-engines in his day? Indeed, yes. After a while, however, the  _role_ of spectator began to pall. He wanted to _do_ something.  Wandering round the room he found a chisel, and upon the instant,  in direct contravention of the treaty respecting rotting, he sat down  and started carving his name on a smooth deal board which looked  as if nobody wanted it. The pair worked on in silence, broken only  by an occasional hard breath as the toil grew exciting. Chapple's  tongue was out and performing mystic evolutions as he carved the  letters. He felt inspired.    He was beginning the A when he was brought to earth again by the voice  of Brooke.    \"You _are_ an idiot,\" said Brooke, complainingly. \"That's  _my_ board, and now you've spoilt it.\"    Spoilt it! Chapple liked that! Spoilt it, if you please, when he had  done a beautiful piece of carving on it!    \"Well, it can't be helped now,\" said Brooke, philosophically. \"I  suppose it's not your fault you're such an ass. Anyhow, come on now.  It's struck eight.\"    \"It's what?\" gasped Chapple.    \"Struck eight. But it doesn't matter. Appleby never minds one being a  bit late for breakfast.\"    \"Oh,\" said Chapple. \"Oh, doesn't he!\"            *       *       *       *       *    Go into Seymour's at eight sharp any morning and look down the table,  and you will see the face of G. M. Chapple--obscured every now and  then, perhaps, by a coffee cup or a slice of bread and marmalade. He  has not been late for three weeks. The spare room is now occupied by  Postlethwaite, of the Upper Fourth, whose place in Milton's dormitory  has been taken by Chapple. Milton is the head of the house, and stands  alone among the house prefects for the strenuousness of his methods in  dealing with his dormitory. Nothing in this world is certain, but it  is highly improbable that Chapple will be late again. There are  swagger-sticks.          SHIELDS' AND THE CRICKET CUP      The house cricket cup at Wrykyn has found itself on some strange  mantelpieces in its time. New talent has a way of cropping up in the  house matches. Tail-end men hit up fifties, and bowlers who have never  taken a wicket before except at the nets go on fifth change, and  dismiss first eleven experts with deliveries that bounce twice and  shoot. So that nobody is greatly surprised in the ordinary run of  things if the cup does not go to the favourites, or even to the second  or third favourites. But one likes to draw the line. And Wrykyn drew  it at Shields'. And yet, as we shall proceed to show, Shields' once  won the cup, and that, too, in a year when Donaldson's had four first  eleven men and Dexter's three.    Shields' occupied a unique position at the School. It was an  absolutely inconspicuous house. There were other houses that were  slack or wild or both, but the worst of these did something. Shields'  never did anything. It never seemed to want to do anything. This may  have been due in some degree to Mr. Shields. As the housemaster is, so  the house is. He was the most inconspicuous master on the staff. He  taught a minute form in the junior school, where earnest infants  wrestled with somebody's handy book of easy Latin sentences, and  depraved infants threw cunningly compounded ink-balls at one another  and the ceiling. After school he would range the countryside with a  pickle-bottle in search of polly woggles and other big game, which he  subsequently transferred to slides and examined through a microscope  till an advanced hour of the night. The curious part of the matter  was that his house was never riotous. Perhaps he was looked on as a  non-combatant, one whom it would be unfair and unsporting to rag. At  any rate, a weird calm reigned over the place; and this spirit seemed  to permeate the public lives of the Shieldsites. They said nothing much  and they did nothing much and they were very inoffensive. As a rule,  one hardly knew they were there.    Into this abode of lotus-eaters came Clephane, a day boy, owing to the  departure of his parents for India. Clephane wanted to go to  Donaldson's. In fact, he said so. His expressions, indeed, when he  found that the whole thing had been settled, and that he was to spend  his last term at school at a house which had never turned out so much  as a member of the Gym. Six, bordered on the unfilial. It appeared  that his father had met Mr. Shields at dinner in the town--a fact to  which he seemed to attach a mystic importance. Clephane's criticism of  this attitude of mind was of such a nature as to lead his father to  address him as Archibald instead of Archie.    However, the thing was done, and Clephane showed his good sense by  realising this and turning his energetic mind to the discovery of the  best way of making life at Shields' endurable. Fortune favoured him by  sending to the house another day boy, one Mansfield. Clephane had not  known him intimately before, though they were both members of the  second eleven; but at Shields' they instantly formed an alliance. And  in due season--or a little later--the house matches began. Henfrey, of  Day's, the Wrykyn cricket captain, met Clephane at the nets when the  drawing for opponents had been done.    \"Just the man I wanted to see,\" said Henfrey. \"I suppose you're  captain of Shields' lot, Clephane? Well, you're going to scratch as  usual, I suppose?\"    For the last five seasons that lamentable house had failed to put a  team into the field. \"You'd better,\" said Henfrey, \"we haven't  overmuch time as it is. That match with Paget's team has thrown us out  a lot. We ought to have started the house matches a week ago.\"    \"Scratch!\" said Clephane. \"Don't you wish we would! My good chap,  we're going to get the cup.\"    \"You needn't be a funny ass,\" said Henfrey in his complaining voice,  \"we really are awfully pushed. As it is we shall have to settle the  opening rounds on the first innings. That's to say, we can only give  'em a day each; if they don't finish, the winner of the first innings  wins. You"]]]
