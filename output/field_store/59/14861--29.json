When, through the development of the sentence, all the offices of  the different parts of speech are mastered, the most natural thing is to  continue the work of classification and subdivide the parts of speech. The  inflection of words, being distinct from their classification, makes a  separate division of the work. If the chief end of grammar were to enable  one to parse, we should not here depart from long-established precedent.    +Sentences in Groups--Paragraphs+.--In tracing the growth of the sentence  from the simplest to the most complex form, each element, as it is  introduced, is illustrated by a large number of detached sentences, chosen  with the utmost care as to thought and expression. These compel the pupil  to confine his attention to one thing till he gets it well in hand.  Paragraphs from literature are then selected to be used at intervals, with  questions and suggestions to enforce principles already presented, and to  prepare the way informally for the regular lessons that follow. The lessons  on these selections are, however, made to take a much wider scope. They  lead the pupil to discover how and why sentences are grouped into  paragraphs, and how paragraphs are related to each other; they also lead  him on to discover whatever is most worthy of imitation in the style of the  several models presented.    +The Use of the Diagram+.--In written analysis, the simple map, or diagram,  found in the following lessons, will enable the pupil to present directly  and vividly to the eye the exact function of every clause in the sentence,  of every phrase in the clause, and of every word in the phrase--to picture  the complete analysis of the sentence, with principal and subordinate parts  in their proper relations. It is only by the aid of such a map, or picture,  that the pupil can, at a single view, see the sentence as an organic whole  made up of many parts performing various functions and standing in various  relations. Without such map he must labor under the disadvantage of seeing  all these things by piecemeal or in succession.    But, if for any reason the teacher prefers not to use these diagrams, they  may be omitted without causing the slightest break in the work. The plan of  this book is in no way dependent on the use of the diagrams.    +The Objections to the Diagram+.--The fact that the pictorial diagram  groups the parts of a sentence according to their offices and relations,  and not in the order of speech, has been spoken of as a fault. It is on the  contrary, a merit, for it teaches the pupil to look through the literary  order and discover the logical order. He thus learns what the literary  order really is, and sees that this may be varied indefinitely, so long as  the logical relations are kept clear.    The assertion that correct diagrams can be made mechanically is not borne  out by the facts. It is easier to avoid precision in oral analysis than in  written. The diagram drives the pupil to a most searching examination of  the sentence, brings him face to face with every difficulty, and compels a  decision on every point.    +The Abuse of the Diagram+.--Analysis by diagram often becomes so  interesting and so helpful that, like other good things, it is liable to be  overdone. There is danger of requiring too much written analysis. When the  ordinary constructions have been made clear, diagrams should be used only  for the more difficult sentences, or, if the sentences are long, only for  the more difficult parts of them. In both oral and written analysis there  is danger of repeating what needs no repetition. When the diagram has  served its purpose, it should be dropped.    SUGGESTIONS FOR COMPOSITION EXERCISES    The exercises in composition found in the numbered Lessons of this book are  generally confined to the illustration and the practical application of the  principles of the science as these principles are developed step by step.  To break up the continuity of the text by thrusting unrelated composition  work between lessons closely related and mutually dependent is exceedingly  unwise.    The Composition Exercises suggested in this revision of \"Graded Lessons\"  are designed to review the regular Lessons and to prepare in a broad,  informal way for text work that follows. But since these Exercises go much  farther, and teach the pupil how to construct paragraphs and how to observe  and imitate what is good in different authors, they are placed in a  supplement, and not between consecutive Lessons of the text.    To let such general composition work take the place of the regular grammar  lesson, say once a week, will be profitable. We suggest that the sentence  work on the selections in the Supplement be made to follow Lessons 30, 40,  50, 60, 70, 77; but each teacher must determine for himself when these and  the other outlined lessons can best be used. We advise that other  selections from literature be made and these exercises continued with the  treatment of the parts of speech.    For composition work to precede Lesson 30 we suggest that the teacher break  up a short story of one or two paragraphs into simple sentences, making  some of these transposed, some interrogative, and some exclamatory. The  pupils may be required to copy these, to underline the subject and the  predicate, and to tell, in answer to suggestive questions, what some of the  other words and groups of words do (the questions on the selections in the  Supplement may aid the teacher). The pupils may then write out the story in  full form. To vary the exercise, the teacher might read the story and let  the pupils write out the short sentences.          A TALK ON LANGUAGE.      The teacher is recommended, before assigning any lesson, to occupy the time  of at least two or three recitations, in talking with his pupils about  language, always remembering that, in order to secure the interest of his  class, he must allow his pupils to take an active part in the exercise. The  teacher should guide the thought of his class; but, if he attempt to do  _all the talking_, he will find, when he concludes, that he has been  left to do _all the thinking_.    We give below a few hints in conducting this talk on language, but the  teacher is not expected to confine himself to them. He will, of course, be  compelled, in some instances, to resort to various devices in order to  obtain from the pupils answers equivalent to those here suggested.          LESSON 1.    +Teacher+.--I will pronounce these three sounds very slowly and distinctly,  thus: _b-u-d_. Notice, it is the _power_, or _sound_, of the letter, and  not its name, that I give. What did you hear?    +Pupil+.--I heard three sounds.    +T.--+Give them. I will write on the board, so that you can see them, three  letters--_b-u-d_. Are these letters, taken separately, signs to you of  anything?    +P.--+Yes, they are signs to me of the three sounds that I have just heard.    +T.--+What then do these letters, taken separately, picture to your eye?    +P.--+They picture the sounds that came to my ear.    +T+.--Letters then are the signs of what?    +P.--Letters are the signs of sounds+.    +T+.--I will pronounce the same three sounds more rapidly, uniting them  more closely--_bud_. These sounds, so united, form a spoken word. Of what  do you think when you hear the word _bud_?    +P+.--I think of a little round thing that grows to be a leafy branch or a  flower.    +T+.--Did you see the thing when you were thinking of it?    +P+.--No.    +T+.--Then you must have had a picture of it in your mind. We call this  +mental picture+ an +idea+. What called up this idea?    +P+.--It was called up by the word _bud_, which I heard.    +T+.--A _spoken word_ then is the sign of what?    +P.--A spoken word is the sign of an idea+.    +T+.--I will call up the same idea in another way. I will _write_ three  _letters_ and unite them thus: _bud_. What do you see?    +P+.--I see the word _bud_.    +T+.--If we call the other word _bud_ a _spoken_ word, what shall we call  this?    +P+.--This is a _written_ word.    +T+.--If they stand for the same idea, how do they differ?    +P+.--I _see_ this, and I _heard_ that.    +T+.--You will observe that we have called attention to _four_ different  things; viz., the +real bud+; your _mental picture_ of the bud, which we  have called an +idea+; and the +two words+, which we have called signs of  this idea, the one addressed to the ear, and the other to the eye.    If the pupil be brought to see these distinctions, it may aid him to  observe more closely and express himself more clearly.          LESSON 2.    +Teacher+.--What did you learn in the previous Lesson?    +Pupil+.--I learned that a spoken word is composed of certain sounds, and  that letters are signs of sounds, and that spoken and written words are the  signs of ideas.    This question should be passed from one pupil to another till all of these  answers are elicited.    All the written words in all the English books ever made, are formed of  twenty-six letters, representing about forty sounds. These letters and  these sounds make up what is called artificial language.    Of these twenty-six letters, +a, e, i, o, u+, and sometimes +w+ and +y+,  are called +vowels+, and the remainder are called +consonants+.    In order that you may understand what kind of sounds the vowels stand for,  and what kinds the consonants represent, I will tell you something about  the _human voice_.    The air breathed out from your lungs beats against two flat muscles,  stretched like strings across the top of the windpipe, and causes them to  vibrate. This vibrating makes sound. Take a thread, put one end between  your teeth, hold the other in your fingers, draw it tight and strike it,  and you will understand how voice is made.    If the voice thus produced comes out through the mouth held well open, a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7014"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#2)"],[1,"inhabitants. What are the causes of the diminution of the waters of  the lake? Is this diminution more rapid now than in former ages? Can  we presume that an equilibrium between the waters flowing in and the  waters lost will be shortly re-established, or may we apprehend that  the lake will entirely disappear?    According to astronomical observations made at La Victoria, Hacienda  de Cura, Nueva Valencia, and Guigue, the length of the lake in its  present state from Cagua to Guayos, is ten leagues, or twenty-eight  thousand eight hundred toises. Its breadth is very unequal. If we  judge from the latitudes of the mouth of the Rio Cura and the village  of Guigue, it nowhere surpasses 2.3 leagues, or six thousand five  hundred toises; most commonly it is but four or five miles. The  dimensions, as deduced from my observations are much less than those  hitherto adopted by the natives. It might be thought that, to form a  precise idea of the progressive diminution of the waters, it would be  sufficient to compare the present dimensions of the lake with those  attributed to it by ancient chroniclers; by Oviedo for instance, in  his History of the Province of Venezuela, published about the year  1723. This writer in his emphatic style, assigns to \"this inland sea,  this monstruoso cuerpo de la laguna de Valencia\"* (* \"Enormous body of  the lake of Valencia.\"), fourteen leagues in length and six in  breadth. He affirms that at a small distance from the shore the lead  finds no bottom; and that large floating islands cover the surface of  the waters, which are constantly agitated by the winds. No importance  can be attached to estimates which, without being founded on any  measurement, are expressed in leagues (leguas) reckoned in the  colonies at three thousand, five thousand, and six thousand six  hundred and fifty varas.* (* Seamen being the first, and for a long  time the only, persons who introduced into the Spanish colonies any  precise ideas on the astronomical position and distances of places,  the legua nautica of 6650 varas, or of 2854 toises (20 in a degree),  was originally used in Mexico and throughout South America; but this  legua nautica has been gradually reduced to one-half or one-third, on  account of the slowness of travelling across steep mountains, or dry  and burning plains. The common people measure only time directly; and  then, by arbitrary hypotheses, infer from the time the space of ground  travelled over. In the course of my geographical researches, I have  had frequent opportunities of examining the real value of these  leagues, by comparing the itinerary distances between points lying  under the same meridian with the difference of latitudes.) Oviedo, who  must so often have passed over the valleys of Aragua, asserts that the  town of Nueva Valencia del Rey was built in 1555, at the distance of  half a league from the lake; and that the proportion between the  length of the lake and its breadth, is as seven to three. At present,  the town of Valencia is separated from the lake by level ground of  more than two thousand seven hundred toises (which Oviedo would no  doubt have estimated as a space of a league and a half); and the  length of the basin of the lake is to its breadth as 10 to 2.3, or as  7 to 1.6. The appearance of the soil between Valencia and Guigue, the  little hills rising abruptly in the plain east of the Cano de Cambury,  some of which (el Islote and la Isla de la Negra or Caratapona) have  even preserved the name of islands, sufficiently prove that the waters  have retired considerably since the time of Oviedo. With respect to  the change in the general form of the lake, it appears to me  improbable that in the seventeenth century its breadth was nearly the  half of its length. The situation of the granite mountains of Mariara  and of Guigue, the slope of the ground which rises more rapidly  towards the north and south than towards the east and west, are alike  repugnant to this supposition.    In treating the long-discussed question of the diminution of the  waters, I conceive we must distinguish between the different periods  at which the sinking of their level has taken place. Wherever we  examine the valleys of rivers, or the basins of lakes, we see the  ancient shore at great distances. No doubt seems now to be  entertained, that our rivers and lakes have undergone immense  diminutions; but many geological facts remind us also, that these  great changes in the distribution of the waters have preceded all  historical times; and that for many thousand years most lakes have  attained a permanent equilibrium between the produce of the water  flowing in, and that of evaporation and filtration. Whenever we find  this equilibrium broken, it will be well rather to examine whether the  rupture be not owing to causes merely local, and of very recent date,  than to admit an uninterrupted diminution of the water. This reasoning  is conformable to the more circumspect method of modern science. At a  time when the physical history of the world, traced by the genius of  some eloquent writers, borrowed all its charms from the fictions of  imagination, the phenomenon of which we are treating would have been  adduced as a new proof of the contrast these writers sought to  establish between the two continents. To demonstrate that America rose  later than Asia and Europe from the bosom of the waters, the lake of  Tacarigua would have been described as one of those interior basins  which have not yet become dry by the effects of slow and gradual  evaporation. I have no doubt that, in very remote times, the whole  valley, from the foot of the mountains of Cocuyza to those of Torito  and Nirgua, and from La Sierra de Mariara to the chain of Guigue, of  Guacimo, and La Palma, was filled with water. Everywhere the form of  the promontories, and their steep declivities, seem to indicate the  shore of an alpine lake, similar to those of Styria and Tyrol. The  same little helicites, the same valvatae, which now live in the lake  of Valencia, are found in layers of three or four feet thick as far  inland as Turmero and La Concesion near La Victoria. These facts  undoubtedly prove a retreat of the waters; but nothing indicates that  this retreat has continued from a very remote period to our days. The  valleys of Aragua are among the portions of Venezuela most anciently  peopled; and yet there is no mention in Oviedo, or any other old  chronicler, of a sensible diminution of the lake. Must we suppose,  that this phenomenon escaped their observation, at a time when the  Indians far exceeded the white population, and when the banks of the  lake were less inhabited? Within half a century, and particularly  within these thirty years, the natural desiccation of this great basin  has excited general attention. We find vast tracts of land which were  formerly inundated, now dry, and already cultivated with plantains,  sugar-canes, or cotton. Wherever a hut is erected on the bank of the  lake, we see the shore receding from year to year. We discover  islands, which, in consequence of the retreat of the waters, are just  beginning to be joined to the continent, as for instance the rocky  island of Culebra, in the direction of Guigue; other islands already  form promontories, as the Morro, between Guigue and Nueva Valencia,  and La Cabrera, south-east of Mariara; others again are now rising in  the islands themselves like scattered hills. Among these last, so  easily recognised at a distance, some are only a quarter of a mile,  others a league from the present shore. I may cite as the most  remarkable three granite islands, thirty or forty toises high, on the  road from the Hacienda de Cura to Aguas Calientes; and at the western  extremity of the lake, the Serrito de Don Pedro, Islote, and  Caratapona. On visiting two islands entirely surrounded by water, we  found in the midst of brushwood, on small flats (four, six, and even  eight toises height above the surface of the lake,) fine sand mixed  with helicites, anciently deposited by the waters. (Isla de Cura and  Cabo Blanco. The promontory of Cabrera has been connected with the  shore ever since the year 1750 or 1760 by a little valley, which bears  the name of Portachuelo.) In each of these islands may be perceived  the most certain traces of the gradual sinking of the waters. But  still farther (and this accident is regarded by the inhabitants as a  marvellous phenomenon) in 1796 three new islands appeared to the east  of the island Caiguira, in the same direction as the islands Burro,  Otama, and Zorro. These new islands, called by the people Los nuevos  Penones, or Los Aparecidos,* (* Los Nuevos Penones, the New Rocks. Los  Aparecidos, the Unexpectedly-appeared.) form a kind of banks with  surfaces quite flat. They rose, in 1800, more than a foot above the  mean level of the water.    It has already been observed that the lake of Valencia, like the lakes  of the valley of Mexico, forms the centre of a little system of  rivers, none of which have any communication with the ocean. These  rivers, most of which deserve only the name of torrents, or brooks,*  are twelve or fourteen in number. (* The following are their names:  Rios de Aragua, Turmero, Maracay, Tapatapa, Agnes Calientes, Mariara,  Cura, Guacara, Guataparo, Valencia, Cano Grande de Cambury, etc.) The  inhabitants, little acquainted with the effects of evaporation, have  long imagined that the lake has a subterranean outlet, by which a  quantity of water runs out equal to that which flows in by the rivers.  Some suppose that this outlet communicates with grottos, supposed to  be at great depth; others believe that the water flows through an  oblique channel into the basin of the ocean. These bold hypotheses on  the communication between two neighbouring basins have presented  themselves in every zone to the imagination of the ignorant, as well  as to that of the learned; for the latter,"]]]
