Three feet he  dug--four--five, and the sand grew dark, then moist.  At six feet water  began to seep through.    \"Get the little basket in my pack,\" he said.    Cameron complied, and saw his comrade drop the basket into the deep  hole, where it kept the sides from caving in and allowed the water to  seep through.  While Cameron watched, the basket filled.  Of all the  strange incidents of his desert career this was the strangest.  Curiously he picked up the peach branch and held it as he had seen it  held.  The thing, however, was dead in his hands.    \"I see you haven't got it,\" remarked his comrade.  \"Few men have.\"    \"Got what?\" demanded Cameron.    \"A power to find water that way.  Back in Illinois an old German used  to do that to locate wells.  He showed me I had the same power. I can't  explain.  But you needn't look so dumfounded.  There's nothing  supernatural about it.\"    \"You mean it's a simple fact--that some men have a magnetism, a force  or power to find water as you did?\"    \"Yes.  It's not unusual on the farms back in Illinois, Ohio,  Pennsylvania.  The old German I spoke of made money traveling round  with his peach fork.\"    \"What a gift for a man in the desert!\"    Cameron's comrade smiled--the second time in all those days.    They entered a region where mineral abounded, and their march became  slower.  Generally they took the course of a wash, one on each side,  and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the bleached  blades of scant grass, or at sage or cactus, while they searched in the  canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold.  When they found any  rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a chemical  test.  The search was fascinating.  They interspersed the work with  long, restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and  smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains. Some impelling desire, not  all the lure of gold, took them to the top of mesas and escarpments;  and here, when they had dug and picked, they rested and gazed out at  the wide prospect.  Then, as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to  dent its red disk behind far-distant spurs, they halted in a shady  canyon or likely spot in a dry wash and tried for water.  When they  found it they unpacked, gave drink to the tired burros, and turned them  loose.  Dead mesquite served for the campfire.  While the strange  twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones,  with eyes on the dying embers of the fire, and soon they lay on the  sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces.    Each succeeding day and night Cameron felt himself more and more drawn  to this strange man.  He found that after hours of burning toil he had  insensibly grown nearer to his comrade.  He reflected that after a few  weeks in the desert he had always become a different man. In  civilization, in the rough mining camps, he had been a prey to unrest  and gloom.  But once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely  world, he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness. Did not  the desert magnify men?  Cameron believed that wild men in wild places,  fighting cold, heat, starvation, thirst, barrenness, facing the  elements in all their ferocity, usually retrograded, descended to the  savage, lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes.  Likewise he  believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed  that brutal order of life and became noble, wonderful, super-human.  So  now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins,  and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man, alone on the  desert, driven there by life's mysterious and remorseless motive, were  to see each other through God's eyes.    His companion was one who thought of himself last.  It humiliated  Cameron that in spite of growing keenness he could not hinder him from  doing more than an equal share of the day's work.  The man was mild,  gentle, quiet, mostly silent, yet under all his softness he seemed to  be made of the fiber of steel.  Cameron could not thwart him.  Moreover, he appeared to want to find gold for Cameron, not for  himself.  Cameron's hands always trembled at the turning of rock that  promised gold; he had enough of the prospector's passion for fortune to  thrill at the chance of a strike.  But the other never showed the least  trace of excitement.    One night they were encamped at the head of a canyon.  The day had been  exceedingly hot, and long after sundown the radiation of heat from the  rocks persisted.  A desert bird whistled a wild, melancholy note from a  dark cliff, and a distant coyote wailed mournfully. The stars shone  white until the huge moon rose to burn out all their whiteness.  And on  this night Cameron watched his comrade, and yielded to interest he had  not heretofore voiced.    \"Pardner, what drives you into the desert?\"    \"Do I seem to be a driven man?\"    \"No. But I feel it.  Do you come to forget?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Ah!\" softly exclaimed Cameron.  Always he seemed to have known that.  He said no more.  He watched the old man rise and begin his nightly  pace to and fro, up and down.  With slow, soft tread, forward and back,  tirelessly and ceaselessly, he paced that beat. He did not look up at  the stars or follow the radiant track of the moon along the canyon  ramparts.  He hung his head.  He was lost in another world.  It was a  world which the lonely desert made real. He looked a dark, sad,  plodding figure, and somehow impressed Cameron with the helplessness of  men.    Cameron grew acutely conscious of the pang in his own breast, of the  fire in his heart, the strife and torment of his passion-driven soul.  He had come into the desert to remember a woman.  She appeared to him  then as she had looked when first she entered his life--a golden-haired  girl, blue-eyed, white-skinned, red-lipped, tall and slender and  beautiful. He had never forgotten, and an old, sickening remorse  knocked at his heart.  He rose and climbed out of the canyon and to the  top of a mesa, where he paced to and fro and looked down into the weird  and mystic shadows, like the darkness of his passion, and farther on  down the moon track and the glittering stretches that vanished in the  cold, blue horizon.  The moon soared radiant and calm, the white stars  shone serene.  The vault of heaven seemed illimitable and divine.  The  desert surrounded him, silver-streaked and black-mantled, a chaos of  rock and sand, silent, austere, ancient, always waiting.  It spoke to  Cameron.  It was a naked corpse, but it had a soul.  In that wild  solitude the white stars looked down upon him pitilessly and pityingly.  They had shone upon a desert that might once have been alive and was  now dead, and might again throb with life, only to die.  It was a  terrible ordeal for him to stand alone and realize that he was only a  man facing eternity.  But that was what gave him strength to endure.  Somehow he was a part of it all, some atom in that vastness, somehow  necessary to an inscrutable purpose, something indestructible in that  desolate world of ruin and death and decay, something perishable and  changeable and growing under all the fixity of heaven.  In that  endless, silent hall of desert there was a spirit; and Cameron felt  hovering near him what he imagined to be phantoms of peace.    He returned to camp and sought his comrade.    \"I reckon we're two of a kind,\" he said.  \"It was a woman who drove me  into the desert.  But I come to remember.  The desert's the only place  I can do that.\"    \"Was she your wife?\" asked the elder man.    \"No.\"    A long silence ensued.  A cool wind blew up the canyon, sifting the  sand through the dry sage, driving away the last of the lingering heat.  The campfire wore down to a ruddy ashen heap.    \"I had a daughter,\" said Cameron's comrade.  \"She lost her mother at  birth.  And I--I didn't know how to bring up a girl.  She was pretty  and gay.  It was the--the old story.\"    His words were peculiarly significant to Cameron.  They distressed him.  He had been wrapped up in his remorse.  If ever in the past he had  thought of any one connected with the girl he had wronged he had long  forgotten.  But the consequences of such wrong were far-reaching.  They  struck at the roots of a home.  Here in the desert he was confronted by  the spectacle of a splendid man, a father, wasting his life because he  could not forget--because there was nothing left to live for.  Cameron  understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert.    \"Well, tell me more?\" asked Cameron, earnestly.    \"It was the old, old story.  My girl was pretty and free.  The young  bucks ran after her.  I guess she did not run away from them. And I was  away a good deal--working in another town.  She was in love with a wild  fellow.  I knew nothing of it till too late.  He was engaged to marry  her. But he didn't come back.  And when the disgrace became plain to  all, my girl left home.  She went West.  After a while I heard from  her.  She was well--working--living for her baby.  A long time passed.  I had no ties.  I drifted West.  Her lover had also gone West.  In  those days everybody went West.  I trailed him, intending to kill him.  But I lost his trail.  Neither could I find any trace of her.  She had  moved on, driven, no doubt, by the hound of her past.  Since then I  have taken to the wilds, hunting gold on the desert.\"    \"Yes, it's the old, old story, only sadder, I think,\" said Cameron; and  his voice was strained and unnatural.  \"Pardner, what Illinois town was  it you hailed from?\"    \"Peoria.\"    \"And your--your name?\" went on Cameron huskily.    \"Warren--Jonas Warren.\"    That name might as well have been a bullet.  Cameron stood erect,  motionless, as men sometimes stand momentarily when shot straight  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/503"],[0,"The Blue Fairy Book (#2)"],[1,"you, I am willing  to help you. I will give you a ship to take you back to your own country  upon one condition.\"    \"Whatever it may be, I accept it willingly.\"    \"Follow me to my palace.\"    The minister's son followed the rich stranger, whom he had not  recognized. When they reached the palace the gardener's son made a sign  to his slaves, who completely undressed the new-comer.    \"Make this ring red-hot,\" commanded the master, \"and mark the man with  it upon his back.\"    The slaves obeyed him.    \"Now, young man,\" said the rich stranger, \"I am going to give you a  vessel which will take you back to your own country.\"    And, going out, he took the bronze ring and said:    \"Bronze ring, obey thy master. Prepare me a ship of which the  half-rotten timbers shall be painted black, let the sails be in rags,  and the sailors infirm and sickly. One shall have lost a leg, another  an arm, the third shall be a hunchback, another lame or club-footed or  blind, and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars. Go, and  let my orders be executed.\"    The minister's son embarked in this old vessel, and thanks to favorable  winds, at length reached his own country. In spite of the pitiable  condition in which he returned they received him joyfully.    \"I am the first to come back,\" said he to the King; now fulfil your  promise, and give me the princess in marriage.    So they at once began to prepare for the wedding festivities. As to the  poor princess, she was sorrowful and angry enough about it.    The next morning, at daybreak, a wonderful ship with every sail set came  to anchor before the town. The King happened at that moment to be at the  palace window.    \"What strange ship is this,\" he cried, \"that has a golden hull, silver  masts, and silken sails, and who are the young men like princes who man  it? And do I not see St. Nicholas at the helm? Go at once and invite the  captain of the ship to come to the palace.\"    His servants obeyed him, and very soon in came an enchantingly handsome  young prince, dressed in rich silk, ornamented with pearls and diamonds.    \"Young man,\" said the King, \"you are welcome, whoever you may be. Do me  the favor to be my guest as long as you remain in my capital.\"    \"Many thanks, sire,\" replied the captain, \"I accept your offer.\"    \"My daughter is about to be married,\" said the King; \"will you give her  away?\"    \"I shall be charmed, sire.\"    Soon after came the Princess and her betrothed.    \"Why, how is this?\" cried the young captain; \"would you marry this  charming princess to such a man as that?\"    \"But he is my prime minister's son!\"    \"What does that matter? I cannot give your daughter away. The man she is  betrothed to is one of my servants.\"    \"Your servant?\"    \"Without doubt. I met him in a distant town reduced to carrying away  dust and rubbish from the houses. I had pity on him and engaged him as  one of my servants.\"    \"It is impossible!\" cried the King.    \"Do you wish me to prove what I say? This young man returned in a vessel  which I fitted out for him, an unseaworthy ship with a black battered  hull, and the sailors were infirm and crippled.\"    \"It is quite true,\" said the King.    \"It is false,\" cried the minister's son. \"I do not know this man!\"    \"Sire,\" said the young captain, \"order your daughter's betrothed to be  stripped, and see if the mark of my ring is not branded upon his back.\"    The King was about to give this order, when the minister's son, to save  himself from such an indignity, admitted that the story was true.    \"And now, sire,\" said the young captain, \"do you not recognize me?\"    \"I recognize you,\" said the Princess; \"you are the gardener's son whom I  have always loved, and it is you I wish to marry.\"    \"Young man, you shall be my son-in-law,\" cried the King. \"The marriage  festivities are already begun, so you shall marry my daughter this very  day.\"    And so that very day the gardener's son married the beautiful Princess.    Several months passed. The young couple were as happy as the day was  long, and the King was more and more pleased with himself for having  secured such a son-in-law.    But, presently, the captain of the golden ship found it necessary to  take a long voyage, and after embracing his wife tenderly he embarked.    Now in the outskirts of the capital there lived an old man, who had  spent his life in studying black arts--alchemy, astrology, magic,  and enchantment. This man found out that the gardener's son had only  succeeded in marrying the Princess by the help of the genii who obeyed  the bronze ring.    \"I will have that ring,\" said he to himself. So he went down to the  sea-shore and caught some little red fishes. Really, they were  quite wonderfully pretty. Then he came back, and, passing before the  Princess's window, he began to cry out:    \"Who wants some pretty little red fishes?\"    The Princess heard him, and sent out one of her slaves, who said to the  old peddler:    \"What will you take for your fish?\"    \"A bronze ring.\"    \"A bronze ring, old simpleton! And where shall I find one?\"    \"Under the cushion in the Princess's room.\"    The slave went back to her mistress.    \"The old madman will take neither gold nor silver,\" said she.    \"What does he want then?\"    \"A bronze ring that is hidden under a cushion.\"    \"Find the ring and give it to him,\" said the Princess.    And at last the slave found the bronze ring, which the captain of the  golden ship had accidentally left behind and carried it to the man, who  made off with it instantly.    Hardly had he reached his own house when, taking the ring, he said,  \"Bronze ring, obey thy master. I desire that the golden ship shall turn  to black wood, and the crew to hideous negroes; that St. Nicholas shall  leave the helm and that the only cargo shall be black cats.\"    And the genii of the bronze ring obeyed him.    Finding himself upon the sea in this miserable condition, the young  captain understood that some one must have stolen the bronze ring from  him, and he lamented his misfortune loudly; but that did him no good.    \"Alas!\" he said to himself, \"whoever has taken my ring has probably  taken my dear wife also. What good will it do me to go back to my own  country?\" And he sailed about from island to island, and from shore to  shore, believing that wherever he went everybody was laughing at him,  and very soon his poverty was so great that he and his crew and the poor  black cats had nothing to eat but herbs and roots. After wandering about  a long time he reached an island inhabited by mice. The captain landed  upon the shore and began to explore the country. There were mice  everywhere, and nothing but mice. Some of the black cats had followed  him, and, not having been fed for several days, they were fearfully  hungry, and made terrible havoc among the mice.    Then the queen of the mice held a council.    \"These cats will eat every one of us,\" she said, \"if the captain of the  ship does not shut the ferocious animals up. Let us send a deputation to  him of the bravest among us.\"    Several mice offered themselves for this mission and set out to find the  young captain.    \"Captain,\" said they, \"go away quickly from our island, or we shall  perish, every mouse of us.\"    \"Willingly,\" replied the young captain, \"upon one condition. That is  that you shall first bring me back a bronze ring which some clever  magician has stolen from me. If you do not do this I will land all my  cats upon your island, and you shall be exterminated.\"    The mice withdrew in great dismay. \"What is to be done?\" said the Queen.  \"How can we find this bronze ring?\" She held a new council, calling in  mice from every quarter of the globe, but nobody knew where the bronze  ring was. Suddenly three mice arrived from a very distant country. One  was blind, the second lame, and the third had her ears cropped.    \"Ho, ho, ho!\" said the new-comers. \"We come from a far distant country.\"    \"Do you know where the bronze ring is which the genii obey?\"    \"Ho, ho, ho! we know; an old sorcerer has taken possession of it, and  now he keeps it in his pocket by day and in his mouth by night.\"    \"Go and take it from him, and come back as soon as possible.\"    So the three mice made themselves a boat and set sail for the magician's  country. When they reached the capital they landed and ran to the  palace, leaving only the blind mouse on the shore to take care of the  boat. Then they waited till it was night. The wicked old man lay down in  bed and put the bronze ring into his mouth, and very soon he was asleep.    \"Now, what shall we do?\" said the two little animals to each other.    The mouse with the cropped ears found a lamp full of oil and a bottle  full of pepper. So she dipped her tail first in the oil and then in the  pepper, and held it to the sorcerer's nose.    \"Atisha! atisha!\" sneezed the old man, but he did not wake, and the  shock made the bronze ring jump out of his mouth. Quick as thought the  lame mouse snatched up the precious talisman and carried it off to the  boat.    Imagine the despair of the magician when he awoke and the bronze ring  was nowhere to be found!    But by that time our three mice had set sail with their prize. A  favoring breeze was carrying them toward the island where the queen  of the mice was awaiting them. Naturally they began to talk about the  bronze ring.    \"Which of us deserves the most credit?\" they cried all at once.    \"I do,\" said the blind mouse, \"for without my watchfulness our boat  would have drifted away to the open sea.\"    \"No, indeed,\" cried the mouse with the cropped ears; \"the credit is  mine. Did I not cause the ring to jump out of the man's mouth?\"    \"No, it is mine,\" cried the lame one, \"for I ran off with the ring.\"    And from high words they soon came to blows, and, alas! when the quarrel  was fiercest the bronze ring fell into the sea.    \"How are we to face our queen,\" said the three mice \"whe"]]]
