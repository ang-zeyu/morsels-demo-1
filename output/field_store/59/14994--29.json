He is reported  to have made a visit to Egypt, to have fixed the year at three hundred  and sixty-five days, to have determined the course of the sun from  solstice to solstice, and to have calculated eclipses. He attributed an  eclipse of the moon to the interposition of the earth between the sun  and moon, and an eclipse of the sun to the interposition of the moon  between the sun and earth,--and thus taught the rotundity of the earth,  sun, and moon. He also determined the ratio of the sun's diameter to its  apparent orbit. As he first solved the problem of inscribing a  right-angled triangle in a circle, he is the founder of geometrical  science in Greece. He left, however, nothing to writing; hence all  accounts of him are confused,--some doubting even if he made the  discoveries attributed to him. His philosophical speculations, which  science rejects,--such as that water is the principle of all  things,--are irrelevant to a description of the progress of astronomy.  That he was a great light no one questions, considering the ignorance  with which he was surrounded.    Anaximander, who followed Thales in philosophy, held to puerile  doctrines concerning the motions and nature of the stars, which it is  useless to repeat. His addition to science, if he made any, was in  treating the magnitudes and distances of the planets. He constructed  geographical charts, and attempted to delineate the celestial sphere,  and to measure time with a gnomon, or time-pillar, by the motion of its  shadow upon a dial.[2]    [Footnote 2: Dr. E.H. Knight, in his \"American Mechanical Dictionary\"  (i. 692), cites the Scriptural account of the beautiful altar seen by  King Ahaz of Jerusalem, in Damascus, when he went thither to greet  Tiglath-Pileser, the Assyrian who had helped him against his Samarian  enemy. Ahaz erected a similar altar at Jerusalem, and also a _sun-dial,_  the same one mentioned in the account of the miraculous cure of his son  Hezekiah. \"This,\" says Dr. Knight, \"was probably the first dial on  record, and is one hundred and forty years before Thales, and nearly  four hundred before Plato and Aristotle, and just a little previous to  the lunar eclipses observed at Babylon, as recorded by Ptolemy.... The  Hebrew word [for this dial] is said by Colonel White of the Bengal army  to signify a _staircase_, which much strengthens the inference that it  was like the equinoctial dial of the Indian nations and of Mesopotamia,  from whence its pattern is assumed to have been derived.\"]    Anaximenes of Miletus taught, like his predecessors, crude notions of  the sun and stars, and speculated on the nature of the moon, but did  nothing to advance his science on true grounds, except by the  construction of sun-dials. The same may be said of Heraclitus,  Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Anaxagoras: they were great men, but they  gave to the world mere speculations, some of which are very puerile.  They all held to the idea that the heavenly bodies revolved around the  earth, and that the earth was a plain; but they explained eclipses, and  supposed that the moon derived its light from the sun. Some of them  knew the difference between the planets and the fixed stars. Anaxagoras  scouted the notion that the sun was a god, and supposed it to be a mass  of ignited stone,--for which he was called an atheist.    Socrates, who belonged to another school, avoided all barren  speculations concerning the universe, and confined himself to human  actions and interests. He looked even upon geometry in a very practical  way, valuing it only so far as it could be made serviceable to  land-measuring. As for the stars and planets, he supposed it was  impossible to arrive at a true knowledge of them, and regarded  speculations upon them as useless.    It must be admitted that the Greek astronomers, however barren were  their general theories, laid the foundation of science. Pythagoras  taught the obliquity of the ecliptic, probably learned in Egypt, and the  identity of the morning and evening stars. It is supposed that he  maintained that the sun was the centre of the universe, and that the  earth revolved around it; but this he did not demonstrate, and his whole  system was unscientific, assuming certain arbitrary principles, from  which he reasoned deductively. \"He assumed that fire is more worthy than  earth; that the more worthy place must be given to the more worthy; that  the extremity is more worthy than the intermediate parts,--and hence,  as the centre is an extremity, the place of fire is at the centre of the  universe, and that therefore the earth and other heavenly bodies move  round the fiery centre.\" But this was no heliocentric system, since the  sun moved, like the earth, in a circle around the central fire. This was  merely the work of the imagination, utterly unscientific, though bold  and original. Nor did this hypothesis gain credit, since it was the  fixed opinion of philosophers that the earth was the centre of the  universe, around which the sun, moon, and planets revolved. But the  Pythagoreans were the first to teach that the motions of the sun, moon,  and planets are circular and equable. Their idea that the celestial  bodies emitted a sound, and were combined into a harmonious symphony,  was exceedingly crude, however beautiful \"The music of the spheres\"  belongs to poetry, as well as to the speculations of Plato.    Eudoxus, in the fifth century before Christ, contributed to science by  making a descriptive map of the heavens, which was used as a manual of  sidereal astronomy to the sixth century of our era.    The error of only one hundred and ninety days in the periodic time of  Saturn shows that there had been for a long time close observations.  Aristotle--whose comprehensive intellect, like that of Bacon, took in  all forms of knowledge--condensed all that was known in his day into a  treatise concerning the heavens. He regarded astronomy as more  intimately connected with mathematics than any other branch of science.  But even he did not soar far beyond the philosophers of his day, since  he held to the immobility of the earth,--the grand error of the  ancients. Some few speculators in science (like Heraclitus of Pontus,  and Hicetas) conceived a motion of the earth itself upon its axis, so as  to account for the apparent motion of the sun; but they also thought it  was in the centre of the universe.    The introduction of the gnomon (time-pillar) and dial into Greece  advanced astronomical knowledge, since they were used to determine the  equinoxes and solstices, as well as parts of the day. Meton set up a  sun-dial at Athens in the year 433 B.C., but the length of the hour  varied with the time of the year, since the Greeks divided the day into  twelve equal parts. Dials were common at Rome in the time of Plautus,  224 B.C.; but there was a difficulty in using them, since they failed at  night and in cloudy weather, and could not be relied on. Hence the  introduction of water-clocks instead.    Aristarchus is said to have combated (280 B.C.) the geocentric theory so  generally received by philosophers, and to have promulgated the  hypothesis \"that the fixed stars and the sun are immovable; that the  earth is carried round the sun in the circumference of a circle of  which the sun is the centre; and that the sphere of the fixed stars,  having the same centre as the sun, is of such magnitude that the orbit  of the earth is to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the  sphere of the fixed stars is to its surface.\" Aristarchus also,  according to Plutarch, explained the apparent annual motion of the sun  in the ecliptic by supposing the orbit of the earth to be inclined to  its axis. There is no evidence that this great astronomer supported his  heliocentric theory with any geometrical proof, although Plutarch  maintains that he demonstrated it. This theory gave great offence,  especially to the Stoics; and Cleanthes, the head of the school at that  time, maintained that the author of such an impious doctrine should be  punished. Aristarchus left a treatise \"On the Magnitudes and Distances  of the Sun and Moon;\" and his methods to measure the apparent diameters  of the sun and moon are considered theoretically sound by modern  astronomers, but practically inexact owing to defective instruments. He  estimated the diameter of the sun at the seven hundred and twentieth  part of the circumference of the circle which it describes in its  diurnal revolution, which is not far from the truth; but in this  treatise he does not allude to his heliocentric theory.    Archimedes of Syracuse, born 287 B.C., is stated to have measured the  distance of the sun, moon, and planets, and he constructed an orrery in  which he exhibited their motions. But it was not in the Grecian colony  of Syracuse, but of Alexandria, that the greatest light was shed on  astronomical science. Here Aristarchus resided, and also Eratosthenes,  who lived between the years 276 and 196 B.C. The latter was a native of  Athens, but was invited by Ptolemy Euergetes to Alexandria, and placed  at the head of the library. His great achievement was the determination  of the circumference of the earth. This was done by measuring on the  ground the distance between Syene, a city exactly under the tropic, and  Alexandria, situated on the same meridian. The distance was found to be  five thousand stadia. The meridional distance of the sun from the zenith  of Alexandria he estimated to be 7 deg. 12', or a fiftieth part of the  circumference of the meridian. Hence the circumference of the earth was  fixed at two hundred and fifty thousand stadia,--which is not very  different from our modern computation. The circumference being known,  the diameter of the earth was easily determined. The moderns have added  nothing to this method.

Yet I must record one thing which I saw during my watch; though  this was from the edge of the hilltop which overlooked the  weed-continent, and was not in the valley, but in the stretch of clear  water which lay between the island and the weed. As I saw it, it seemed  to me that a number of great fish were swimming across from the island,  diagonally towards the great continent of weed: they were swimming in one  wake, and keeping a very regular line; but not breaking the water after  the manner of porpoises or black fish. Yet, though I have mentioned this,  it must not be supposed that I saw any very strange thing in such a  sight, and indeed, I thought nothing more of it than to wonder what sort  of fish they might be; for, as I saw them indistinctly in the moonlight,  they made a queer appearance, seeming each of them to be possessed of two  tails, and further, I could have thought I perceived a flicker as of  tentacles just beneath the surface; but of this I was by no means sure.    Upon the following morning, having hurried our breakfast, each of us  set-to again upon our tasks; for we were in hopes to have the great bow  at work before dinner. Soon, the bo'sun had finished his arrow, and mine  was completed very shortly after, so that there lacked nothing now to  the completion of our work, save the finishing of the line, and the  getting of the bow into position. This latter, assisted by the men, we  proceeded now to effect, making a level bed of rocks near the edge of  the hill which overlooked the weed. Upon this we placed the great bow,  and then, having sent the men back to their work at the line, we  proceeded to the aiming of the huge weapon. Now, when we had gotten the  instrument pointed, as we conceived, straight over the hulk, the which  we accomplished by squinting along the groove which the bo'sun had burnt  down the center of the stock, we turned-to upon the arranging of the  notch and trigger, the notch being to hold the strings when the weapon  was set, and the trigger--a board bolted on loosely at the side just  below the notch--to push them upwards out of this place when we desired  to discharge the bow. This part of the work took up no great portion of  our time, and soon we had all ready for our first flight. Then we  commenced to set the bows, bending the bottom one first, and then those  above in turn, until all were set; and, after that, we laid the arrow  very carefully in the groove. Then I took two pieces of spun yarn and  frapped the strings together at each end of the notch, and by this means  I was assured that all the strings would act in unison when striking the  butt of the arrow. And so we had all things ready for the discharge;  whereupon, I placed my foot upon the trigger, and, bidding the bo'sun  watch carefully the flight of the arrow, pushed downwards. The next  instant, with a mighty twang, and a quiver that made the great stock  stir on its bed of rocks, the bow sprang to its lesser tension, hurling  the arrow outwards and upwards in a vast arc. Now, it may be conceived  with what mortal interest we watched its flight, and so in a minute  discovered that we had aimed too much to the right, for the arrow struck  the weed ahead of the hulk--but _beyond_ it. At that, I was filled near  to bursting with pride and joy, and the men who had come forward to  witness the trial, shouted to acclaim my success, whilst the bo'sun  clapped me twice upon the shoulder to signify his regard, and shouted as  loud as any.    And now it seemed to me that we had but to get the true aim, and the  rescue of those in the hulk would be but a matter of another day or two;  for, having once gotten a line to the hulk, we should haul across a thin  rope by its means, and with this a thicker one; after which we should set  this up so taut as possible, and then bring the people in the hulk to the  island by means of a seat and block which we should haul to and fro along  the supporting line.    Now, having realized that the bow would indeed carry so far as the wreck,  we made haste to try our second arrow, and at the same time we bade the  men go back to their work upon the line; for we should have need of it in  a very little while. Presently, having pointed the bow more to the left,  I took the frappings off the strings, so that we could bend the bows  singly, and after that we set the great weapon again. Then, seeing that  the arrow was straight in the groove, I replaced the frappings, and  immediately discharged it. This time, to my very great pleasure and  pride, the arrow went with a wonderful straightness towards the ship,  and, clearing the superstructure, passed out of our sight as it fell  behind it. At this, I was all impatience to try to get the line to the  hulk before we made our dinner; but the men had not yet laid-up  sufficient; there being then only four hundred and fifty fathoms (which  the bo'sun measured off by stretching it along his arms and across his  chest). This being so, we went to dinner, and made very great haste  through it; and, after that, every one of us worked at the line, and so  in about an hour we had sufficient; for I had estimated that it would not  be wise to make the attempt with a less length than five hundred fathoms.    Having now completed a sufficiency of the line, the bo'sun set one of the  men to flake it down very carefully upon the rock beside the bow, whilst  he himself tested it at all such parts as he thought in any way doubtful,  and so, presently, all was ready. Then I bent it on to the arrow, and,  having set the bow whilst the men were flaking down the line, I was  prepared immediately to discharge the weapon.    Now, all the morning, a man upon the hulk had observed us through a  spy-glass, from a position that brought his head just above the edge of  the superstructure, and, being aware of our intentions--having watched  the previous flights--he understood the bo'sun, when he beckoned to him,  that we had made ready for a third shot, and so, with an answering wave  of his spy-glass, he disappeared from our sight. At that, having first  turned to see that all were clear of the line, I pressed down the  trigger, my heart beating very fast and thick, and so in a moment the  arrow was sped. But now, doubtless because of the weight of the line, it  made nowhere near so good a flight as on the previous occasion, the arrow  striking the weed some two hundred yards short of the hulk, and at this,  I could near have wept with vexation and disappointment.    Immediately upon the failure of my shot, the bo'sun called to the men to  haul in the line very carefully, so that it should not be parted through  the arrow catching in the weed; then he came over to me, and proposed  that we should set-to at once to make a heavier arrow, suggesting that it  had been lack of weight in the missile which had caused it to fall short.  At that, I felt once more hopeful, and turned-to at once to prepare a new  arrow; the bo'sun doing likewise; though in his case he intended to make  a lighter one than that which had failed; for, as he put it, though the  heavier one fell short, yet might the lighter succeed, and if neither,  then we could only suppose that the bow lacked power to carry the line,  and in that case, we should have to try some other method.    Now, in about two hours, I had made my arrow, the bo'sun having finished  his a little earlier, and so (the men having hauled in all the line and  flaked it down ready) we prepared to make another attempt to cast it  over the hulk. Yet, a second time we failed, and by so much that it  seemed hopeless to think of success; but, for all that it appeared  useless, the bo'sun insisted on making a last try with the light arrow,  and, presently, when we had gotten the line ready again, we loosed upon  the wreck; but in this case so lamentable was our failure, that I cried  out to the bo'sun to set the useless thing upon the fire and burn it;  for I was sorely irked by its failure, and could scarce abide to speak  civilly of it.    Now the bo'sun, perceiving how I felt, sung out that we would cease  troubling about the hulk for the present, and go down all of us to gather  reeds and weed for the fire; for it was drawing nigh to evening. And this  we did, though all in a disconsolate condition of mind; for we had seemed  so near to success, and now it appeared to be further than ever from us.  And so, in a while, having brought up a sufficiency of fuel, the bo'sun  sent two of the men down to one of the ledges which overhung the sea, and  bade them see whether they could not secure a fish for our supper. Then,  taking our places about the fire, we fell-to upon a discussion as to how  we should come at the people in the hulk.    Now, for a while there came no suggestion worthy of notice, until at last  there occurred to me a notable idea, and I called out suddenly that we  should make a small fire balloon, and float off the line to them by such  means. At that, the men about the fire were silent a moment; for the idea  was new to them, and moreover they needed to comprehend just what I  meant. Then, when they had come fully at it, the one who had proposed  that they should make spears of their knives, cried out to know why a  kite would not do, and at that I was confounded, in that so simple an  expedient had not occurred to any before; for, surely, it would be but a  little matter to float a line to them by means of a kite, and, further,  such a thing would take no great making.    And so, after a space of talk, it was decided that upon the morrow we  should build some sort of kite, and with it fly a line over the hulk, the  which should be a task of no great difficulty with so good a breeze as we  had continually with us.    And, presently, having made our supper "]]]
