Hast thou             eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou             shouldest not eat?    01:003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,             she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.    01:003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou             hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I             did eat.    01:003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done             this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast             of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt             thou eat all the days of thy life:    01:003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between             thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou             shalt bruise his heel.    01:003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and             thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and             thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over             thee.    01:003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the             voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I             commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is             the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all             the days of thy life;    01:003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and             thou shalt eat the herb of the field;    01:003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou             return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for             dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.    01:003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the             mother of all living.    01:003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of             skins, and clothed them.    01:003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,             to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,             and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:    01:003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,             to till the ground from whence he was taken.    01:003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the             garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned             every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.    01:004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,             and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.    01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of             sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.    01:004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of             the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.    01:004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and             of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to             his offering:    01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain             was very wroth, and his countenance fell.    01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is             thy countenance fallen?    01:004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou             doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be             his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.    01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,             when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel             his brother, and slew him.    01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he             said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?    01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's             blood crieth unto me from the ground.    01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her             mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;    01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield             unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou             be in the earth.    01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I             can bear.    01:004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the             earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a             fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to             pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.    01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,             vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a             mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.    01:004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in             the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.    01:004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and             he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the             name of his son, Enoch.    01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and             Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.    01:004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was             Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.    01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in             tents, and of such as have cattle.    01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all             such as handle the harp and organ.    01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every             artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was             Naamah.    01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my             voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have             slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.    01:004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and             sevenfold.    01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called             his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another             seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.    01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called             his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the             LORD.    01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that             God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;    01:005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called             their name Adam, in the day when they were created.    01:005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in             his own likeness, and after his image;
