Mr. Lighthall would remind us, did we in England  need reminding, that Canada owes her very existence at this moment  to a splendid act of patriotism--the withdrawal out of the rebel  colonies of the British loyalists after the war of the revolution.  It is 'the noblest epic migration the world has ever seen,' says  Mr. Lighthall, 'more loftily epic than the retirement of Pius  AEneas from Ilion.' Perhaps so, but at present the dreamy spirit  of Antiquity knows not one word of the story. In a thousand years'  time he will have heard of it, possibly, and then he will carefully  consider those two 'retirements' as subjects for epic poetry.\"    The article went on to remark that until the Spirit of Antiquity  hears of this latter retirement and takes it into his consideration,  it must, as poetic material, give way to another struggle which he  persists in considering to be greater still--the investment by a  handful of Achaians of a little town held by a handful of Trojans.  It is the power of this Spirit of Antiquity that tells against  English poetry as a reflex of the life of man. In Europe, in which,  as Pericles said, \"The whole earth is the tomb of illustrious men,\"  the Spirit of Antiquity is omnipotent.    The article then discussed the main subject of the argument, saying  how very different it is when we come to consider poetic art as the  reflex of the life of Nature. Here the muse of Canada ought to be,  and is, so great and strong. It is not in the old countries, it is  in the new, that the poet can adequately reflect the life of Nature.  It is in them alone that he can confront Nature's face as it is,  uncoloured by associations of history and tradition. What Wordsworth  tried all his life to do, the poets of Canada, of the Australias,  of the Cape, have the opportunity of doing. How many a home-bounded  Englishman must yearn for the opportunity now offered by the  Canadian Pacific Railway of seeing the great virgin forests and  prairies before settlement has made much progress--of seeing them as  they existed before even the foot of the Red Man trod them--of seeing  them without that physical toil which only a few hardy explorers can  undergo. It is hard to realise that he who has not seen the vast  unsettled tracts of the British Empire knows Nature only under the  same aspect as she has been known by all the poets from Homer to our  own day. And when I made the allusion to Pauline Johnson's poems  which brought me such reward, I quoted \"In the Shadows.\" The poem  fascinated me--it fairly haunted me. I could not get it out of my  head; and I remember that I was rather severe on Mr. Lighthall for  only giving us two examples of a poet so rare--so full of the spirit  of the open air.    Naturally I turned to his introductory remarks to see who Pauline  Johnson was. I was not at all surprised to find that she had Indian  blood in her veins, but I was surprised and delighted to find that  she belonged to a famous Indian family--the Mohawks of Brantford.  The Mohawks of Brantford! that splendid race to whose unswerving  loyalty during two centuries not only Canada, but the entire  British Empire owes a debt that can never be repaid.    After the appearance of my article I got a beautiful letter from  Pauline Johnson, and I found that I had been fortunate enough to  enrich my life with a new friendship.    And now as to the genius of Pauline Johnson: it was being recognised  not only in Canada, but all over the great Continent of the  West. Since 1889 I have been following her career with a glow of  admiration and sympathy. I have been delighted to find that this  success of hers had no damaging effect upon the grand simplicity of  her nature. Up to the day of her death her passionate sympathy with  the aborigines of Canada never flagged, as shown by such poems as  \"The Cattle Thief\", \"The Pilot of the Plains\", \"As Red Men Die\",  and many another. During all this time, however, she was cultivating  herself in a thousand ways--taking interest in the fine arts, as  witness her poem \"The Art of Alma-Tadema\". Her native power of  satire is shown in the lines written after Dreyfus was exiled,  called \"'Give us Barabbas'\". She had also a pretty gift of vers de  societe, as seen in her lines \"Your Mirror Frame\".    Her death is not only a great loss to those who knew and loved her:  it is a great loss to Canadian literature and to the Canadian  nation. I must think that she will hold a memorable place among  poets in virtue of her descent and also in virtue of the work she  has left behind, small as the quantity of that work is. I believe  that Canada will, in future times, cherish her memory more and more,  for of all Canadian poets she was the most distinctly a daughter of  the soil, inasmuch as she inherited the blood of the great primeval  race now so rapidly vanishing, and of the greater race that has  supplanted it.    In reading the description of the funeral in the \"News-Advertiser,\"  I was specially touched by the picture of the large crowd of silent  Red Men who lined Georgia Street, and who stood as motionless as  statues all through the service, and until the funeral cortege had  passed on the way to the cemetery. This must have rendered the  funeral the most impressive and picturesque one of any poet that  has ever lived.                                                Theodore Watts-Dunton.      The Pines,      Putney Hill.    20th August, 1913.          AUTHOR'S FOREWORD    This collection of verse I have named \"Flint and Feather\" because of  the association of ideas. Flint suggests the Red Man's weapons of  war; it is the arrow tip, the heart-quality of mine own people; let  it therefore apply to those poems that touch upon Indian life and  love. The lyrical verse herein is as a      \"Skyward floating feather,     Sailing on summer air.\"    And yet that feather may be the eagle plume that crests the head of  a warrior chief; so both flint and feather bear the hall-mark of my  Mohawk blood.                                                            E.P.J.        BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH    E. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake) is the youngest child of a family  of four born to the late G. H. M. Johnson (Onwanonsyshon), Head  Chief of the Six Nations Indians, and his wife, Emily S. Howells,  a lady of pure English parentage, her birth-place being Bristol,  England, but the land of her adoption was Canada.    Chief Johnson was of the renowned Mohawk tribe, and of the \"Blood  Royal,\" being a scion of one of the fifty noble families which  composed the historical confederation founded by Hiawatha upwards of  four hundred years ago, and known at that period as the Brotherhood  of the Five Nations, but which was afterwards named the Iroquois by  the early French missionaries and explorers. These Iroquois Indians  have from the earliest times been famed for their loyalty to the  British Crown, in defence of which they fought against both French  and Colonial Revolutionists; and for which fealty they were granted  the magnificent lands bordering the Grand River in the County of  Brant, Ontario, and on which the tribes still live.    It was upon this Reserve, on her father's estate, \"Chiefswood,\"  that Pauline Johnson was born. And it is inevitable that the loyalty  to Britain and Britain's flag which she inherited from her Red  ancestors, as well as from her English mother, breathes through both  her prose and poetic writings.    At an extremely early age this little Indian girl evinced an intense  love of poetry; and even before she could write, composed many  little childish jingles about her pet dogs and cats. She was also  very fond of learning by heart anything that took her fancy, and  would memorize, apparently without effort, verses that were read to  her. A telling instance of this early love of poetry may be cited,  when on one occasion, while she was yet a tiny child of four, a  friend of her father's, who was going to a distant city, asked her  what he could bring her as a present, and she replied, \"Verses,  please.\"    At twelve years of age she was writing fairly creditable poems, but  was afraid to offer them for publication, lest in after years she  might regret their almost inevitable crudity. So she did not publish  anything until after her school days were ended.    Her education was neither extensive nor elaborate, and embraced  neither High School nor College. A nursery governess for two years  at home, three years at an Indian day school half a mile from her  home, and two years in the central school of the City of Brantford  was the extent of her educational training. But besides this she  acquired a wide general knowledge, having been, through childhood  and early girlhood, a great reader, especially of poetry. Before  she was twelve years old she had read every line of Scott's poems,  every line of Longfellow, much of Byron, Shakespeare, and such books  as Addison's \"Spectator,\" Foster's Essays and Owen Meredith.    The first periodicals to accept her poems and place them before  the public were \"Gems of Poetry,\" a small magazine published in  New York, and \"The Week,\" established by the late Professor Goldwin  Smith, of Toronto, the \"New York Independent,\" and \"Toronto Saturday  Night.\" Since then she has contributed to \"The Athenaeum,\" \"The  Academy,\" \"Black and White,\" \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" \"The Daily  Express,\" and \"Canada,\" all of London, England; \"The Review of  Reviews,\" Paris, France; \"Harper's Weekly,\" \"New York Independent,\"  \"Outing,\" \"The Smart Set,\" \"Boston Transcript,\" \"The Buffalo  Express,\" \"Detroit Free Press,\" \"The Boys' World\" (David C. Cook  Publishing Co., Elgin, Illinois), \"The Mothers' Magazine\" (David  C. Cook Publishing Co.), \"The Canadian Magazine,\" \"Toronto Saturday  Night,\" and \"The Province,\" Vancouver, B.C.    In 1892 the opportunity of a lifetime came to this young versifier,  when Frank Yeigh, the president of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#2)"],[1,"l-beloved Son, Jesus Christ, were in  form and stature like unto perfect men; and that the human family  was in very truth of divine origin.  But this wonderful vision  was not the only manifestation of heavenly power and personality  made to the young man, nor the only incident of the kind destined  to bring upon him the fury of persecution.  Sometime after this  visitation, which constituted him a living witness of God unto  men, and which demonstrated the great fact that humanity is the  child of Deity, he was visited by an immortal personage who  announced himself as Moroni, a messenger sent from the presence  of God.  The celestial visitor stated that through Joseph as the  earthly agent the Lord would accomplish a great work, and that  the boy would come to be known by good and evil repute amongst  all nations.  The angel then announced that an ancient record,  engraven on plates of gold, lay hidden in a hill near by, which  record gave a history of the nations that had of old inhabited  the American continent, and an account of the Savior's  ministrations among them.  He further explained that with the  plates were two sacred stones, known as Urim and Thummim, by the  use of which the Lord would bring forth a translation of the  ancient record.  Joseph further testifies that he was told that  if he remained faithful to his trust and the confidence reposed  in him, he would some day receive the record into his keeping,  and be commissioned and empowered to translate it.  In due time  these promises were literally fulfilled, and the modern version  of these ancient writings was given to the world.    The record proved to be an account of certain colonies of  immigrants to this hemisphere from the east, who came several  centuries before the Christian era.  The principal company was  led by one Lehi, described as a personage of some importance and  wealth, who had formerly lived at Jerusalem in the reign of  Zedekiah, and who left his eastern home about 600 B.C.  The book  tells of the journeyings across the water in vessels constructed  according to revealed plan, of the peoples' landing on the  western shores of South America probably somewhere in Chile, of  their prosperity and rapid growth amid the bounteous elements of  the new world, of the increase of pride and consequent dissension  accompanying the accumulation of material wealth, and of the  division of the people into factions which became later two great  nations at enmity with one another.  One part following Nephi,  the youngest and most gifted son of Lehi, designated themselves  _Nephites_; the other faction, led by Laman, the elder and wicked  brother of Nephi, were known as _Lamanites_.    The Nephites lived in cities, some of which attained great size  and were distinguished by great architectural beauty.  Continually advancing northward, these people in time occupied  the greater part of the valleys of the Orinoco, the Amazon, and  the Magdalena.  During the thousand years covered by the Nephite  record, the people crossed the Isthmus of Panama, which is  graphically described as a neck of land but a day's journey from  sea to sea, and successively occupied extensive tracts in what is  now Mexico, the valley of the Mississippi, and the Eastern  States.  It is not to be supposed that these vast regions were  all populated at any one time by the Nephites; the people were  continually moving to escape the depredations of their hereditary  foes, the Lamanites; and they abandoned in turn all their cities  established along the course of migration.  The unprejudiced  student sees in the discoveries of the ancient and now  forest-covered cities of Mexico, Central America, Yucatan, and  the northern regions of South America, collateral testimony  having a bearing upon this history.    Before their more powerful foes, the Nephites dwindled and fled;  until about the year 400 A.D. they were entirely annihilated  after a series of decisive battles, the last of which was fought  near the very hill, called Cumorah, in the State of New York,  where the hidden record was subsequently revealed to Joseph  Smith.    The Lamanites led a roving, aggressive life; kept few or no  records, and soon lost the art of history writing.  They lived on  the results of the chase and by plunder, degenerating in habit  until they became typical progenitors of the dark-skinned race,  afterward discovered by Columbus and named American Indians.    The last writer in the ancient record, and the one who hid away  the plates in the hill Cumorah, was Moroni--the same personage  who appeared as a resurrected being in the nineteenth century, a  divinely appointed messenger sent to reveal the depository of the  sacred documents; but the greater part of the plates since  translated had been engraved by the father of Moroni, the Nephite  prophet Mormon.  This man, at once warrior, prophet and  historian, had made a transcript and compilation of the  heterogeneous records that had accumulated during the troubled  history of the Nephite nation; this compilation was named on the  plates \"The Book of Mormon,\" which name has been given to the  modern translation--a work that has already made its way over  most of the civilized world.  The translation and publication of  the Book of Mormon were marked by many scenes of trouble and  contention, but success attended the undertaking, and the first  edition of the work appeared in print in 1830.    The question, \"What is the Book of Mormon?\"--a very pertinent one  on the part of every earnest student and investigator of this  phase of American history--has been partly answered already.  The  work has been derisively called the \"Mormon Bible,\" a name that  carries with it the misrepresentation that in the faith of this  people the book takes the place of the scriptural volume which is  universally accepted by Christian sects.  No designation could be  more misleading, and in every way more untruthful.  The  Latter-day Saints have but one \"Bible\" and that the Holy Bible of  Christendom.  They place it foremost amongst the standard works  of the Church; they accept its admonitions and its doctrines, and  accord thereto a literal significance; it is to them, and ever  has been, the word of God, a compilation made by human agency of  works by various inspired writers; they accept its teachings in  fulness, modifying the meaning in no wise, except in the rare  cases of undoubted mistranslation, concerning which Biblical  scholars of all faiths differ and criticize; and even in such  cases their reverence for the sacred letter renders them even  more conservative than the majority of Bible commentators and  critics in placing free construction upon the text.  The  historical part of the Jewish scriptures tells of the divine  dealings with the people of the eastern hemisphere; the Book of  Mormon recounts the mercies and judgments of God, the inspired  teachings of His prophets, the rise and fall of His people as  organized communities on the western continent.    The Latter-day Saints believe the coming forth of the Book of  Mormon to have been foretold in the Bible, as its destiny is  prophesied of within its own lids; it is to the people the true  \"stick of Ephraim\" which Ezekiel declared should become one with  the \"stick of Judah\"--or the Bible.  The people challenge the most  critical comparison between this record of the west and the Holy  Scriptures of the east, feeling confident that no discrepancy  exists in letter or spirit.  As to the original characters in  which the record was engraved, copies were shown to learned  linguists of the day and pronounced by them as closely resembling  the Reformed Egyptian writing.    Let us revert, however, to the facts of history concerning this  new scripture, and the reception accorded the printed volume.    The Book of Mormon was before the world; the Church circulated  the work as freely as possible.  The true account of its origin  was rejected by the general public, who thus, assumed the  responsibility of explaining in some plausible way the source of  the record.  Among the many false theories propounded, perhaps  the most famous is the so-called Spaulding story.  Solomon  Spaulding, a clergyman of Amity, Pennsylvania, died in 1816.  He  wrote a romance to which no name other than \"Manuscript Story\"  was given, and which, but for the unauthorized use of the  writer's name and the misrepresentation of his motives, would  never have been published.  Twenty years after the author's  death, one Hurlburt, an apostate \"Mormon,\" announced that he had  recognized a resemblance between the \"Manuscript Story\" and the  Book of Mormon, and expressed a belief that the work brought  forward by Joseph Smith was nothing but the Spaulding romance  revised and amplified.  The apparent credibility of the statement  was increased by various signed declarations to the effect that  the two were alike, though no extracts for comparison were  presented.  But the \"Manuscript Story\" was lost for a time, and  in the absence of proof to the contrary, reports of the  parallelism between the two works multiplied.  By a fortunate  circumstance, in 1884, President James H. Fairchild, of Oberlin  College, and a literary friend of his--a Mr. Rice--while  examining a heterogeneous collection of old papers which had been  purchased by the gentleman last named, found the original  manuscript of the \"Story.\"    After a careful perusal and comparison with the Book of Mormon,  President Fairchild declared in an article published in the New  York _Observer_, February 5, 1885:        The theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon in the      traditional manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will      probably have to be relinquished.  * * *  Mr. Rice,      myself, and others compared it [the Spaulding      manuscript] with the Book of Mormon and could detect      no resemblance between the two, in general or in      detail.  There seems to "]]]
