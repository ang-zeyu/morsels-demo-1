HARRIET BEECHER (STOWE) was born June 14, 1811, in the characteristic  New England town of Litchfield, Conn. Her father was the Rev. Dr. Lyman  Beecher, a distinguished Calvinistic divine, her mother Roxanna Foote,  his first wife. The little new-comer was ushered into a household of  happy, healthy children, and found five brothers and sisters awaiting  her. The eldest was Catherine, born September 6, 1800. Following her  were two sturdy boys, William and Edward; then came Mary, then George,  and at last Harriet. Another little Harriet born three years before had  died when only one month old, and the fourth daughter was named, in  memory of this sister, Harriet Elizabeth Beecher. Just two years after  Harriet was born, in the same month, another brother, Henry Ward, was  welcomed to the family circle, and after him came Charles, the last of  Roxanna Beecher's children.    The first memorable incident of Harriet's life was the death of her  mother, which occurred when she was four years old, and which ever  afterwards remained with her as the tenderest, saddest, and most sacred  memory of her childhood. Mrs. Stowe's recollections of her mother are  found in a letter to her brother Charles, afterwards published in the  \"Autobiography and Correspondence of Lyman Beecher.\" She says:--    \"I was between three and four years of age when our mother died, and  my personal recollections of her are therefore but few. But the deep  interest and veneration that she inspired in all who knew her were such  that during all my childhood I was constantly hearing her spoken of,  and from one friend or another some incident or anecdote of her life  was constantly being impressed upon me.    \"Mother was one of those strong, restful, yet widely sympathetic  natures in whom all around seemed to find comfort and repose. The  communion between her and my father was a peculiar one. It was an  intimacy throughout the whole range of their being. There was no human  mind in whose decisions he had greater confidence. Both intellectually  and morally he regarded her as the better and stronger portion of  himself, and I remember hearing him say that after her death his first  sensation was a sort of terror, like that of a child suddenly shut out  alone in the dark.    \"In my own childhood only two incidents of my mother twinkle like rays  through the darkness. One was of our all running and dancing out before  her from the nursery to the sitting-room one Sabbath morning, and her  pleasant voice saying after us, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it  holy, children.'    \"Another remembrance is this: mother was an enthusiastic horticulturist  in all the small ways that limited means allowed. Her brother John  in New York had just sent her a small parcel of fine tulip-bulbs. I  remember rummaging these out of an obscure corner of the nursery one  day when she was gone out, and being strongly seized with the idea that  they were good to eat, using all the little English I then possessed  to persuade my brothers that these were onions such as grown people  ate and would be very nice for us. So we fell to and devoured the  whole, and I recollect being somewhat disappointed in the odd sweetish  taste, and thinking that onions were not so nice as I had supposed.  Then mother's serene face appeared at the nursery door and we all ran  towards her, telling with one voice of our discovery and achievement.  We had found a bag of onions and had eaten them all up.    \"Also I remember that there was not even a momentary expression of  impatience, but that she sat down and said, 'My dear children, what you  have done makes mamma very sorry. Those were not onions but roots of  beautiful flowers, and if you had let them alone we should have next  summer in the garden great beautiful red and yellow flowers such as you  never saw.' I remember how drooping and dispirited we all grew at this  picture, and how sadly we regarded the empty paper bag.    \"Then I have a recollection of her reading aloud to the children Miss  Edgeworth's 'Frank,' which had just come out, I believe, and was  exciting a good deal of attention among the educational circles of  Litchfield. After that came a time when every one said she was sick,  and I used to be permitted to go once a day into her room, where she  sat bolstered up in bed. I have a vision of a very fair face with a  bright red spot on each cheek and her quiet smile. I remember dreaming  one night that mamma had got well, and of waking with loud transports  of joy that were hushed down by some one who came into the room. My  dream was indeed a true one. She was forever well.    \"Then came the funeral. Henry was too little to go. I can see his  golden curls and little black frock as he frolicked in the sun like a  kitten, full of ignorant joy.    \"I recollect the mourning dresses, the tears of the older children, the  walking to the burial-ground, and somebody's speaking at the grave.  Then all was closed, and we little ones, to whom it was so confused,  asked where she was gone and would she never come back.    \"They told us at one time that she had been laid in the ground, and at  another that she had gone to heaven. Thereupon Henry, putting the two  things together, resolved to dig through the ground and go to heaven  to find her; for being discovered under sister Catherine's window one  morning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6720"],[0,"The Wentworth Letter (#2)"],[1,"ck, who were thus inhumanly driven from their  houses, and had to endure all this abuse and to seek homes where  they could be found. The result was, that a great many of them  being deprived of the comforts of life, and the necessary  attendances, died; many children were left orphans, wives widows,  and husbands widowers.--Our farms were taken possession of by the  mob, many thousands of cattle, sheep, horses, and hogs were taken  and our household goods, store goods, and printing press, and type  were broken, taken, or otherwise destroyed.    Many of our brethren removed to Clay where they continued until  1836, three years; there was no violence offered but there were  threatnings of violence. But in the summer of 1836, these threatnings  began to assume a more serious form; from threats, public meetings  were called, resolutions were passed, vengeance and destruction were  threatened, and affairs again assumed a fearful attitude, Jackson  county was a sufficient precedent, and as the authorities in that  county did not interfere, they boasted that they would not in this,  which on application to the authorities we found to be too true, and  after much violence, privation and loss of property we were again  driven from our homes.    We next settled in Caldwell, and Davies counties, where we made  large and extensive settlements, thinking to free ourselves from the  power of oppression, by settling in new counties with very few  inhabitants in them; but here we were not allowed to live in peace,  but in 1838 we were again attacked by mobs, an exterminating order  was issued by Gov. Boggs, and under the sanction of law an organized  banditti ranged through the country, robbed us of our cattle, sheep,  horses, hogs, &c., many of our people were murdered in cold blood,  the chastity of our women was violated, and we were forced to sign  away our property at the point of the sword, and after enduring every  indignity that could be heaped upon us by an inhuman, ungodly band of  marauders, from twelve to fifteen thousand souls men, women, and  children were driven from their own fire sides, and from lands that  they had warrantee deeds of, houseless, friendless, and homeless (in  the depth of winter,) to wander as exiles on the earth or to seek an  asylum in a more genial clime, and among a less barbarous people.    Many sickened and died, in consequence of the cold, and hardships  they had to endure; many wives were left widows, and children  orphans, and destitute. It would take more time than is allotted me  here to describe the injustice, the wrongs, the murders, the  bloodshed, the theft, misery, and woe that have been caused by the  barbarous, inhuman, and lawless, proceedings of the state of Missouri.    In the situation before alluded to we arrived in the state of  Illinois in 1839, where we found a hospitable people and a friendly  home; a people who were willing to be governed by the principles of  law and humanity. We have commenced to build a city called \"Nauvoo\"  in Hancock co., we number from six to eight thousand here besides  vast numbers in the county around and in almost every county of the  state. We have a city charter granted us and a charter for a legion  the troops of which now number 1500. We have also a charter for a  university, for an agricultural and manufacturing society, have our  own laws and administrators, and possess all the privileges that  other free and enlightened citizens enjoy.    Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only  added fuel to the flame, it has spread with increasing rapidity,  proud of the cause which they have espoused and conscious of our'  innocence and of the truth of their system amidst calumny and  reproach have the elders of this Church gone forth, and planted  the gospel in almost every state in the Union; it has penetrated  our cities, it has spread over our villages and has caused  thousands of our intelligent, noble, and patriotic citizens to obey  its divine mandates, and be governed by its sacred truths. It has  also spread into England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales: in the year  1839 where a few of our missionaries were sent over five thousand  joined the standard of truth, there are numbers now joining in  every land.    Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in  Germany, Palestine, New Holland, the East Indies, and other places,  the standard of truth has been erected: no unhallowed hand can stop  the work from progressing, persecutions may rage, mobs may combine,  armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will  go forth boldly, nobly, and independent till it has penetrated  every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and  sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be  accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.    We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his son Jesus  Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.    We believe that men will be punished for their own sins and not  for Adam's transgression.    We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may  be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    We believe that these ordinances are 1st, Faith in the Lord  Jesus Christ; 2d, Repentance; 3d, Baptism by immersion for the  remission of sins; 4th, Laying on of hands for the gift of the  Holy Ghost.    We believe that a man must be called of God by \"prophesy, and  by laying on of hands\" by those who are in authority to preach the  gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.    We believe in the same organization that existed in the  primitive church, viz, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,  evangelists &c.    We believe in the gift of tongues, prophesy, revelation,  visions, healing, interpretation of tongues &c.    We believe the bible to be the word of God as far as it is  translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the  word of God.    We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now  reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and  important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the  restoration of the Ten Tribes. That Zion will be built upon this  [the American] continent. That Christ will reign personally upon  the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its  paradisiac glory.    We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to  the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same  privilege let them worship how, where, or what they may.    We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and  magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.    We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous,  and in doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the  admonition of Paul \"we believe all things we hope all things,\" we  have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things.  If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praise  worthy we seek after these things.       Respectfully &c.,"]]]
