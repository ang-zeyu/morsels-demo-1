There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking.    Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion    Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children    Left on the land, extending their arms with wildest entreaties.      * * * * * * * * * * *      Suddenly rose from the South a light, as in Autumn the blood red    Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon    Titan-like, stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,    Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together;    Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,    Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lie in the road stead.    Columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were    Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.    Then as the winds seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,    Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred housetops    Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.    These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.    Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,    \"_We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand Pre_.\"    The property which had before escaped the hands of the spoilers was now  laid waste on the plea of discouraging the return of the exiles, who,  through their blinding tears, saw the land of their homes and their  hopes fade from view.    No preparations had been made for their settlement elsewhere; nor  did they receive any compensation for their property from which they  were forced, or that had been wickedly destroyed. In a starving and  penniless state, they were put ashore in small groups at different  points along the coast of New England, where many of them perished  through the hardships they endured. A pathetic representation of their  wrongs was addressed to the English government, and by reference to  solemn treaties made between them and the provincial government, they  proved their banishment to be \"as faithless as it was cruel.\" \"No  attention, however,\" says Marcus Wilson, \"was paid to this document,  and so guarded a silence was preserved by the government of Nova Scotia  upon the subject of the removal of the Acadians, that the records of  the province make no allusion whatever to the event.\"    After the close of the French and Indian war, France ceded all her  possessions in Canada to victorious England. The case of the Acadians  was again brought before the English government, but no compensation  was ever allowed them for the outrages committed against them. The  property of which they were ruthlessly plundered was never restored.  They were allowed to return to the province, and, on taking the  customary oaths, could receive lands; but of the eighteen thousand that  were banished, less than two thousand returned:      Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches    Dwells another race, with other customs and language.    Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic    Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile    Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.    For such atrocious acts as these, we find no apologist among our  historians. On every hand they meet with execration. Such wanton  cruelty--such palpable violations of human rights are stains upon the  escutcheon of the nation that permits them to be perpetrated within her  borders.    It is quite generally supposed that such atrocious crimes as this  against the French peasants of Acadia are only to be met with in former  ages or among non-Christian countries. But in writing the history of  the Rise and Fall of Nauvoo--strange as it may appear, and almost  past believing--it is my task to relate events which have taken place  in the nineteenth century, in this age of boasted enlightenment and  toleration, that shall make the expulsion of the French peasants from  Acadia pale in comparison with them; events which have occurred in the  United States, the boasted asylum for the oppressed of all nations;  events which would be more in keeping with the intolerance of the dark  ages and the cruelty of Spain, during the reign of the inquisition,  than in this age and in this nation. What events are these that so  thunder in the index? Such deeds as outrage humanity, and well-nigh  destroy one's confidence in human governments; mock justice; deride the  claims of mercy; and pull down the wrath of an offended God upon the  people who perform them, and upon the government which allows them to  go unwhipped of justice. Listen to the history of the Rise and Fall of  Nauvoo.        THE RISE AND FALL OF NAUVOO.        CHAPTER I.    NAUVOO.    THE history of the Rise and Fall of Nauvoo is worthy the attention of  the readers of this book because its story is connected with one of  the most important religious movements of this or any other age; and  with the life and death of one of the world's greatest and most unique  characters, the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is worthy of the reader's  attention because the religious institution founded under God by this  man--the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--survives him, and  presents to the world the greatest religious wonder of the age, a right  conception of which cannot be formed without a knowledge of this Nauvoo  period of the history of The Church; a period which is essentially  a formative one, especially in regard to what may be considered the  higher and more complex doctrines of Mormonism. It was in Nauvoo that  Joseph Smith reached the summit of his remarkable career. It was in  Nauvoo he grew bolder in the proclamation of those doctrines which  stamp Mormonism as the great religion of the age. It was in Nauvoo that  Joseph Smith's life expanded into that eloquent fullness which gives so  much promise of what that man will be in eternity. It was in Nauvoo he  contended against a world of opposition; against the power of falsehood  and misrepresentation; against priestcraft; against corruption in  high places; from here he corresponded with statesman, and rebuked  demagogues; from here he went to martyrdom--to seal his testimony with  his blood. And after his death, it was from here his people fled to the  wilderness in the most remarkable exodus of modern times. The Church  fled into the wilderness--not, however to be hidden from the world, but  to be lifted up on high as an ensign to the nations, to be as a city  sitting upon a hill that cannot be hid, but on the contrary, from its  lofty eminence challenges the attention of the world. In Illinois, as  in Missouri, the religious toleration guaranteed in the Constitutions  of both the State of Illinois and of the United States--religious  toleration, at once the boast and pride of Americans, and also the  test of true enlightenment and the highest civilization--this vaunted  toleration was in Nauvoo put to the test and found wanting. That is,  before the exodus of The Church from Nauvoo, it became evident that  a people accepting what to their neighbors was a singular faith, and  one that was unpopular withal, could not live in peace among their  fellow-citizens of other faiths, and hence the exodus, not only from  Nauvoo but from the entire State of Illinois and also from the United  States. The Latter-day Saints, in a word, were expatriated from the  United States, [1] and sought an asylum in the wilderness, and among  tribes of savages. From whence, after half a century, that same Church  emerges, enlarged, prosperous, more firmly rooted in safety and in  strength of faith than ever before--a greater enigma to the religious  world than when it made its exodus from Illinois.    All these things have a relation to Nauvoo, for The Church had a  sort of second birth there, which makes the Rise and Fall of Nauvoo  a theme of peculiar interest to those interested in what the world  calls Mormonism, and who is not or should not be interested in a  religious movement of such proportions, of such pretensions and of such  achievements in the face of such opposition as it has met? * * * * * *    Nauvoo, then, its rise and its fall, is to be the subject of my  discourse. The word Nauvoo comes from the Hebrew, and signifies  beautiful situation; \"carrying with it also,\" says the prophet Joseph  Smith, \"the idea of rest.\" And, indeed, the location of the city is  beautiful. No sooner does one come in view of it than he exclaims,  \"It is rightly named!\" The city, or at least the marred remains  of it, stands on a bold point around which sweeps the placid yet  majestic \"Father of Waters\"--the Mississippi. The city is at least  half encircled by that noble stream. From its banks the ground rises  gradually for at least a mile where it reaches the common level of the  prairie that stretches out to the eastward, farther than the eye can  reach, in a beautifully undulating surface, once covered by a luxuriant  growth of natural grasses and wild flowers, with here and there patches  of timber; but now chequered with meadows, and, at the time of my  visit, in 1885, with fields of waving corn.    Opposite Nauvoo, on the west bank of the river, the bluffs rise rather  abruptly, almost from the water's edge, and are covered, for the most  part, with a fine growth of timber. Nestling at the foot of one of the  highest of these bluffs, and immediately on the bank of the river, is  the little village of Montrose, to which I shall have occasion to refer  in these pages. Back of these bluffs before mentioned, roll off the  alternate prairie and woodlands of Iowa. Between Montrose and Nauvoo,  and perhaps two thirds of the distance across the river from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#2)"],[1,"the Church in and about Nauvoo, the  headquarters, numbered not to exceed 20,000 souls. This information is  based on the best possible authority. And while this was not all the  Church membership in the United States, it was the great bulk of the  Saints, as the following will show:    In the Times and Seasons, volume 2, page 274, in a \"Proclamation to the  Saints scattered abroad,\" and signed by the Presidency Joseph Smith,  Sidney Rigdon, and Hyrum Smith, dated January 15, 1841, we read the  following:        \"The population of our city is increasing with unparalleled      rapidity, numbering more than 3,000 inhabitants. Every facility      is offered in the city and adjacent country, in Hancock county,      for the successful prosecution of the mechanical arts, and the      pleasing pursuits of agriculture. The waters of the Mississippi      can be successfully used for manufacturing purposes, to an almost      unlimited extent.        \"Having been instrumental in the hands of our Heavenly Father      in laying a foundation for the gathering of Zion, we would say,      let all those who appreciate the blessings of the Gospel, and      realize the importance of obeying the commandments of heaven, who      have been blessed of heaven with the possession of this world's      goods, first prepare for the general gathering, let them dispose      of their effects as fast as circumstances will possibly admit,      without making too great sacrifice, and remove to our city and      county--establish and build up manufactories in the city, purchase      and cultivate farms in the county--this will secure our permanent      inheritance, and prepare the way for the gathering of the poor.      This is agreeable to the order of heaven, and the only principle on      which the gathering can be effected--let the rich, then, and all      who can assist in establishing this place, make every preparation      to come on without delay, and strengthen our hands, and assist in      promoting the happiness of the Saints. This cannot be too forcibly      impressed on the minds of all, and the elders are hereby instructed      to proclaim this word in all places where the Saints reside,      in their public administrations, for this is according to the      instructions we have received from the Lord.\"    Now, this shows that the Saints \"scattered abroad\" were commanded of  the Lord to gather at Nauvoo and in Hancock county, Illinois. It will  go without saying that all the faithful Latter-day Saints would take  advantage of this commandment and therefore the faithful Saints, or  the great majority of them would soon be located at Nauvoo. Again in  this same volume, page 434, we find another proclamation to the Saints  abroad, signed by President Joseph Smith, in which he says:        \"The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day      Saints, anxious to promote the prosperity of said Church, feel it      their duty to call upon the Saints who reside out of this county      to make preparations to come in, without delay. This is important      and should be attended to by all who feel an interest in the      prosperity of this the corner stone of Zion. Here the Temple must      be raised, the university be built, and other edifices erected      which are necessary for the great work of the last days; and which      can only be done by a concentration of energy and enterprise. Let      it therefore be understood, that all the stakes, excepting those      in this county and in Lee county, Iowa, are discontinued, and the      Saints instructed to settle in this county as soon as circumstances      will permit.\"    This was on May 24, 1841, and we find in the same volume, page 520, an  epistle from the Twelve to the \"Saints scattered abroad,\" in which the  following is found:        \"We say to all Saints who desire to do the will of heaven, arise,      and tarry not, but come up hither to the places of gathering as      speedily as possible, for the time is rapidly approaching when      the Saints will have occasion to regret that they have so long      neglected to assemble themselves together and stand in holy places      awaiting those tremendous events which are so rapidly approaching      the nations of the earth.        \"It will be recollected that in a recent communication from the      First Presidency, all places of gathering are discontinued,      excepting Hancock county, Ill., and Zarahemla in Lee county, I. T.,      opposite Nauvoo.\"    At the conference of the Church held in October, 1841, Almon W. Babbitt  was disfellowshipped for persuading Saints who were emigrating to  Nauvoo to remain and build up Kirtland, Ohio, as the minutes say,  \"until such time as he shall make satisfaction.\" This shows how  important this doctrine of gathering was. Therefore the great bulk of  the Latter-day Saints, at the time of the martyrdom, were located at  Nauvoo and its vicinity.    It is in order now to show that these Latter-day Saints sustained  President Brigham Young and the Twelve.    On the 8th day of August, following the martyrdom, a special conference  was held in Nauvoo at which time the claims of Sidney Rigdon and the  rightful claim of the Twelve Apostles were presented for the vote  of the Latter-day Saints. At this conference President Young, in  addressing the Saints said:        \"I will ask you as quorums, Do you want Brother Rigdon to stand      forward as your leader, your guide, your spokesman? President      Rigdon wants me to bring up the other question first, and that is,      Does the Church want, and is it their only desire to sustain the      Twelve as the First Presidency of this people? * * * * All that are      in favor of this, in all the congregation of the Saints manifest      it by holding up the right hand. (There was a universal vote.) If      there are any of the contrary mind, every man and every woman who      does not want the Twelve to preside, lift up your hands in like      manner, (no hands up.) This supersedes the other question, and      trying it by quorums.\" (History of the Church, Aug. 8, 1844.)    Also at the general conference held the following October the Apostles  were again unanimously sustained by the vote of the Church as the  presiding quorum and Presidency of the Church. (Times and Seasons,  5:692). Mark you this was by the unanimous vote of the Saints.[2]    Now, in the exodus from Nauvoo these Saints--the great bulk of the  Church, continued to be true and faithful and followed the Twelve  Apostles.    Governor Thomas Ford, in his \"History of Illinois,\" states that in 1846  there were 16,000 Church members with the Twelve on the plains of Iowa,  while the 1,000 that remained, a small remnant, were those who were  unable to sell their property, or who having no property to sell, were  unable to get away. (History of \"Reorganized\" Church iii:164). And this  remnant followed as soon as they were able.    In the census report for 1850--three years after the settlement of  Salt Lake valley, we learn that the population of Utah was 11,380, all  Mormons. That same year the population of Pottawattomie county, Iowa,  was 7,828, all Mormons, the Latter-day Saints at Kanesville. Thus  we see that 19,208 members of the Church who had followed President  Brigham Young in the exodus from Nauvoo, were located at these two  places. And that is not all, there were other settlements of the  Saints at Garden Grove, Mount Pisgah, St. Louis, and other places  where temporary settlements for the Saints were formed during that  exodus. These also later gathered to Utah. Thus we see that almost  the entire membership of the Church as it stood in 1844, is accounted  for in the following of President Brigham Young and the Twelve.  That the Church was not threatened with dissolution the following  statistics will show--I have not at hand the increase of membership of  the Church during that period in the United States, but the increase  in Great Britain is as follows: In the year 1844, the population  of the Church in the British Isles was 7,797. Six years after the  martyrdom--December, 1850--that membership had increased to 30,747.  This does not show much of a dissolution or falling away.      WHO FORSOOK THE CHURCH?    I do not intend to convey the idea that there was not a falling away,  an apostasy, at the time of the martyrdom and the exodus from Nauvoo,  for there were many who forsook the cause, but compared with the Church  membership, they were but few. Who were they? Did the faithful Saints  forsake the Church at that time? Did those who risked their lives--who  were shot with the Prophet and Patriarch forsake the Church? No! We do  not find the faithful Latter-day Saints, who had the Gospel rooted in  their hearts turning away. Then who were those who forsook the cause? I  will tell you.    In the parable of the sower the Savior said:        \"Behold a sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed some seed fell      by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell      upon stony places where they had not much earth; and forthwith they      sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun      was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they      withered away.\"    In explaining this parable He said:        \"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he      that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he      not root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation      or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is      offended.\"    These were they who forsook the Church in the exodus from Nauvoo. Not  the faithful who had been tried and proved and not found wanting, who  had an abiding testimony of the truth. Now, let us see what Gen. Thomas  L. Kane has to say on this subject. He visited Nauvoo about this time  and also the camps of Israel. In the"]]]
