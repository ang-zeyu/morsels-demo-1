Independent of those wants which in man renew themselves every instant;  which he frequently finds it impossible to satisfy; every individual  experiences a multiplicity of evils--he suffers from the inclemency  of the seasons--he pines in penury--he is infected with plague--he  is scourged by war--he is the victim of famine--he is afflicted with  disease--he is the sport of a thousand accidents, &c. This is the reason  why all men are fearful; why the whole human race are diffident. The  knowledge he has of pain alarms him upon all unknown causes, that is to  say, upon all those of which he has not yet experienced the effect; this  experience made with precipitation, or if it be preferred, by instinct,  places him on his guard against all those objects from the operation of  which he is ignorant what consequences may result to himself.    His inquietude is in proportion; his fears keep pace with the extent of  the disorder which these objects produce in him; they are measured by  their rarity, that is to say, by the inexperience he has of them; by the  natural sensibility of the soul; and by the ardour of his imagination.  The wore ignorant man is, the less experience he has, the more he is  susceptible of fear; solitude, the obscurity of a forest, silence, and  the darkness of night, desolate ruins, the roaring of the wind, sudden,  confused noises, are objects of terror to all who are unaccustomed to  these things. The uninformed man is a child whom every thing astonishes;  who trembles at every thing he encounters: his alarms disappear, his  fears diminish, his mind becomes calm, in proportion as experience  familiarizes him, more or less, with natural effects; his fears cease  entirely, as soon as he understands, or believes he understands, the  causes that act; or when he knows how to avoid their effects. But if he  cannot penetrate the causes which disturb him, if he cannot discover the  agents by whom he suffers, if he cannot find to what account to place  the confusion he experiences, his inquietude augments; his fears  redouble; his imagination leads him astray; it exaggerates his evil;  paints in a disorderly manner these unknown objects of his terror;  magnifies their powers; then making an analogy between them and those  terrific objects, with whom he is already acquainted, he suggests  to himself the means he usually takes to mitigate their anger; to  conciliate their kindness; he employs similar measures to soften the  anger, to disarm the power, to avert the effects of the concealed cause  which gives birth to his inquietudes, which fills him with anxiety,  which alarms his fears. It is thus his weakness, aided by ignorance,  renders him superstitious.    There are very few men, even in our own day, who have sufficiently  studied nature, who are fully apprised of physical causes, or with the  effects they must necessarily produce. This ignorance, without doubt,  was much greater in the more remote ages of the world, when the human  mind, yet in its infancy, had not collected that experience, taken that  expansion, made those strides towards improvement, which distinguishes  the present from the past. Savages dispersed, erratic, thinly scattered  up and down, knew the course of nature either very imperfectly or not  at all; society alone perfects human knowledge: it requires not only  multiplied but combined efforts to unravel the secrets of nature. This  granted, all natural causes were mysteries to our wandering ancestors;  the entire of nature was an enigma to them; all its phenomena was  marvellous, every event inspired terror to beings who were destitute  of experience; almost every thing, they saw must have appeared to them  strange, unusual, contrary to their idea of the order of things.    It cannot then furnish matter for surprise, if we behold men in the  present day trembling at the sight of those objects which have formerly  filled their fathers with dismay. _Eclipse, comets, meteors_, were, in  ancient days, subjects of alarm to all the people of the earth: these  effects, so natural in the eyes of the sound philosopher, who has by  degrees fathomed their true causes, have yet the right, possess the  power, to alarm the most numerous, to excite the fears of the least  instructed part of modern nations. The people of the present day, as  well as their ignorant ancestors, find something marvellous, believe  there is a supernatural agency in all those objects to which their eyes  are unaccustomed; they consider all those unknown causes as wonderful,  that act with a force of which their mind has no idea it is possible  the known agents are capable. The ignorant see wonders _prodigies,  miracles_, in all those striking effects of which they are unable to  render themselves a satisfactory account; all the causes which produce  them they think _supernatural_; this, however, really implies nothing  more than that they are not familiar to them, or that they have not  hitherto witnessed natural agents, whose energy was equal to the  production of effects so rare, so astonishing, as those with which their  sight has been appalled.    Besides the ordinary phenomena to which nations were witnesses without  being competent to unravel the causes, they have in times very remote  from ours, experienced calamities, whether general or local, which  filled them with the most cruel inquietude; which plunged them into an  abyss of consternation. The traditions of all people, the annals of all  nations, recal, even at this day, melancholy events, physical disasters,  dreadful catastrophes, which had the effect of spreading universal  terror among our forefathers, But when history should be silent on these  stupendous revolutions, would not our own reflection on what passes  under our eyes be sufficient to convince us, that all parts of our globe  have been, and following the course of things, will necessarily be  again violently agitated, overturned, changed, overflowed, in a state of  conflagration? Vast continents have been inundated, seas breaking their  limits have usurped the dominion of the earth; at length retiring,  these waters have left striking, proofs of their presence, by the marine  vestiges of shells, skeletons of sea fish, &c. which the attentive  observer meets with at every step, in the bowels of those fertile  countries we now inhabit--subterraneous fires have opened to themselves  the most frightful volcanoes, whose craters frequently issue destruction  on every side. In short, the elements unloosed, have at various times,  disputed among themselves the empire of our globe; this exhibits  evidence of the fact, by those vast heaps of wreck, those stupendous  ruins spread over its surface. What, then, must have been the fears of  mankind, who in those countries believed he beheld the entire of nature  armed against his peace, menacing with destruction his very abode? What  must have been the inquietude of a people taken thus unprovided, who  fancied they saw nature cruelly labouring to their annihilation? Who  beheld a world ready to be dashed into atoms; who witnessed the earth  suddenly rent asunder; whose yawning chasm was the grave of large  cities, whole provinces, entire nations? What ideas must mortals, thus  overwhelmed with terror, form to themselves of the irresistible cause  that could produce such extended effects? Without doubt they did not  attribute these wide spreading calamities to nature; neither did they  conceive they were mere physical causes; they could not suspect she was  the author, the accomplice of the confusion she herself experienced;  they did not see that these tremendous revolutions, these overpowering  disorders, were the necessary result of her immutable laws; that they  contributed to the general order by which she subsists; that, in point  of fact, there was nothing more surprising in the inundation of large  portions of the earth, in the swallowing up an entire nation, in a  volcanic conflagration spreading destruction over whole provinces, than  there is in a stone falling to the earth, or the death of a fly; that  each equally has its spring in the necessity of things.    It was under these astounding circumstances, that nations, bathed in  the most bitter tears, perplexed with the most frightful visions,  electrified with terror, not believing there existed on this mundane  ball, causes sufficiently powerful to operate the gigantic phenomena  that filled their minds with dismay, carried their streaming eyes  towards heaven, where their tremulous fears led them to suppose these  unknown agents, whose unprovoked enmity destroyed, their earthly  felicity, could alone reside.    It was in the lap of ignorance, in the season of alarm, in the bosom of  calamity, that mankind ever formed his first notions of the _Divinity_.  From hence it is obvious that his ideas on this subject are to be  suspected, that his notions are in a great measure false, that they are  always afflicting. Indeed, upon whatever part of our sphere we cast  our eyes, whether it be upon the frozen climates of the north, upon the  parching regions of the south, or under the more temperate zones, we  every where behold the people when assailed by misfortunes, have either  made to themselves national gods, or else have adopted those which have  been given them by their conquerors; before these beings, either  of their own creation or adoption, they have tremblingly prostrated  themselves in the hour of calamity, soliciting relief; have ignorantly  attributed to blocks of stone, or to men like themselves, those natural  effects which were above their comprehension; the inhabitants of many  nations, not contented with the national gods, made each to himself  one or more gods, which he supposed presided exclusively over his own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#2)"],[1,"about half-way between Gregory's lowest southward point and the head of  the Gulf of Carpentaria. Without actually reaching the country explored  by Gregory, he had overlapped his brother explorer's position by one  degree and a half, or more than one hundred miles, and was about two  hundred and fifty miles in actual distance from the nearest part of the  shores of the Gulf. It is important to remark that the attack of the  savages which forced Mr. Stuart to return occurred on June 26th, 1860, so  that he had virtually crossed the continent two months before Messrs.  Burke and Wills had left Melbourne.* (* They did not leave Cooper Creek  until December 14th, rather more than a fortnight before Mr. Stuart  started on his fifth expedition.)    On New Year's day 1861, Mr. Stuart again left Adelaide, aided this time  by a grant from the Colonial Government of 2500 pounds, in addition to  the assistance of his well-tried friends Messrs. Chambers and Finke. He  made his former position with ease, and advanced about one hundred miles  beyond it, to latitude 17 degrees, longitude 133 degrees; but an  impenetrable scrub barred all further progress, and failing provisions,  etc., compelled him, after such prolonged and strenuous efforts that his  horses on one occasion were one hundred and six hours without water, most  reluctantly to return. The expedition arrived safely in the settled  districts in September, and the determined explorer, after a delay of  less than a month, was again despatched by the South Australian  Government along what had now become to him a familiar road. This time  success crowned his efforts; a passage was found northwards through the  opposing scrub, and leaving the Gulf of Carpentaria far to the right, the  Indian Ocean itself was reached. Other explorers had merely seen the rise  and fall of the tide in rivers, boggy ground and swamps intervening and  cutting off all chance of ever seeing the sea. But Stuart actually stood  on its shore and washed his hands in its waters! What a pleasure it must  have been to the leader when, knowing well from his reckoning that the  sea must be close at hand, but keeping it a secret from all except Thring  and Auld, he witnessed the joyful surprise of the rest of the party!    The expedition reached Adelaide safely, although for a long time the  leader's life was despaired of, the constant hardships of so many  journeys with scarcely any intermission having brought on a terrible  attack of scurvy. The South Australian Government in 1859 liberally  rewarded Mr. Stuart and his party for their successful enterprise.* (*  Mr. Stuart's qualities as a practised Bushman are unrivalled, and he has  always succeeded in bringing his party back without loss of life.) On the  10th of March a resolution was passed to the effect that a sum of 3500  pounds should be paid as a reward to John McDouall Stuart, Esquire, and  the members of his party, in the following proportions: Mr. Stuart 2000  pounds; Mr. Keckwick 500 pounds; Messrs. Thring and Auld 200 pounds each;  and Messrs. King, Billiatt, Frew, Nash, McGorrerey, and Waterhouse, 100  pounds each. Perhaps this is the most fitting place to express Mr.  Stuart's appreciation of the honour done him by the Royal Geographical  Society of London, in awarding him their gold medal and presenting him  with a gold watch. He wishes particularly to express his hearty thanks to  Sir Roderick Murchison, and the other distinguished members of the  society, for the lively interest they have evinced in his welfare.    Mr. Stuart's experiences have led him to form a very decided opinion as  to the cause of the well-known hot winds of Australia, so long the  subject of scientific speculation. North and north-west of Flinders Range  are large plains covered with stones, extending as far as latitude 25  degrees. To the north of that, although the sun was intensely hot, there  were no hot winds; in fact from that parallel of latitude to the Indian  Ocean, either going or returning, they were not met with. \"On reaching  latitude 27 degrees on my return,\" writes Mr. Stuart, \"I found the hot  winds prevailing again as on my outward journey. I saw no sandy desert to  which these hot winds have been attributed, but, on lifting some of the  stones that were lying on the surface,* I found them so hot that I was  obliged to drop them immediately. (* On the surface, as I suppose, of the  large plains North of Flinders Range. ED.) It is my opinion that when a  north wind blows across those stone-covered plains, it collects the heat  from them, and the air, becoming rarified, is driven on southwards with  increased vehemence. To the north of latitude 25 degrees, although  exposure to the sun in the middle of the day was very oppressive, yet the  moment we got under the shade of a tree we felt quite alive again; there  was none of that languid feeling which is experienced in the south during  a hot wind, as for example that which blew on the morning after reaching  the Hamilton,* in latitude 26 degrees 40 minutes. (* Journal 1861 to  1862.) That was one of the hottest winds I ever experienced. I had the  horses brought up at 7 o'clock, intending to proceed, but seeing there  was a very hot wind coming on, I had them turned out again. It was well I  did so, for before 10 o'clock all the horses were in small groups under  the trees, and the men lying under the shade of blankets unable to do  anything, so overpowering was the heat.\" Unfortunately, Mr. Stuart had no  thermometer.    Mr. Stuart is anxious to direct attention to the establishment of a  Telegraph line along his route. On this subject he writes as follows:--    \"On my arrival in Adelaide from my last journey I found a great deal of  anxiety felt as to whether a line could be carried across to the mouth of  the Adelaide river. There would be a few difficulties in the way, but  none which could not be overcome and made to repay the cost of such an  undertaking. The first would be in crossing from Mr. Glen's station to  Chambers Creek, in finding timber sufficiently long for poles, supposing  that no more favourable line than I travelled over could be adopted, but  I have good reason for supposing that there is plenty of suitable timber  in the range and creek, not more than ten miles off my track: the  distance between the two places is one hundred miles. From Chambers Creek  through the spring country to the Gap in Hanson Range the cartage would  be a little farther, in consequence of the timber being scarce in some  places. There are many creeks in which it would be found, but I had not  time to examine them in detail. Another difficulty would be in crossing  the McDonnell Range, which is rough and ragged, but there is a great  quantity of timber in the Hugh; the distance to this in a straight line  is not more than seven miles; from thence to the Roper River there are a  few places where the cartage might be from ten to twenty miles, that is  in crossing the plains where only stunted gum-trees grow, but tall timber  can be obtained from the rising ground around them. From latitude 16  degrees 30 minutes south to the north coast, there would be no difficulty  whatever, as there is an abundance of timber everywhere. I am promised  information, through the kindness of Mr. Todd, of the Telegraph  department, as to the average cost of establishing the lines through the  outer districts of this colony, and it is my intention to make a  calculation of the cost of a line on my route, by which the comparative  merits and expense will be tested, and I am of opinion I shall be able to  show most favourable results. I should have been glad for this  information to have accompanied my works, but I find I cannot postpone  them longer for that purpose, as parties have already taken advantage of  the delay occasioned by my illness at the time of, and since, my arrival  home to collect what scraps of information they could obtain, with the  intention of publishing them as my travels. I leave the reward of such  conduct to a discriminating public; I shall not fail to carry out my  intention with regard to a Telegraph line; and should I have no  opportunity of submitting it to the public, I shall take care to advance  the matter in such channels as may be most likely to lead to a successful  issue. I beg reference to my map accompanying this work, which will at  once show the favourable geographical situation of the Adelaide River for  a settlement, and the short and safe route it opens up for communication  and trading with India: indeed when I look upon the present system of  shipping to that important empire, I cannot over-estimate the advantages  that such an extended intercourse would create.\"    Mr. Stuart is also very anxious for the formation of a new colony on the  scene of his discoveries on the River Adelaide, and would fain have been  one of the first pioneers of such an enterprise, but his health has been  so much shattered by his last journey that he can only now hope to see  younger men follow in the path which he had made his own. He writes as  follows:--    \"Judging from the experience I have had in travelling through the  Continent of Australia for the last twenty-two years, and also from the  description that other explorers have given of the different portions  they have examined in their journeys, I have no hesitation in saying,  that the country that I have discovered on and around the banks of the  Adelaide River is more favourable than any other part of the continent  for the formation of a new colony. The soil is generally of the richest  nature ever formed for the benefit of mankind: black and alluvial, and  capable of producing anything that could be desired, and watered by one  of the finest rivers in Australia. This river was found by Lieutenant  Helpman to be about four to seven fathoms deep at the mouth, and at one  hundred and twenty miles up (the furthest point he "]]]
