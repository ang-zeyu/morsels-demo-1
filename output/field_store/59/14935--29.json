A feeble, white-haired old man entered, leaning on the arm of an  indescribably beautiful woman. Not thirty yet, tall and nobly molded,  with straight black brows over magnificent eyes; rippling dark hair  gathered up in a great knot, and ornamented with a single band of gold.  A sweeping dress of wine-colored velvet, set off with a dazzling neck  and arms decorated like her stately head with ornaments of Roman gold.  At the first glance she seemed a cold, haughty creature, born to dazzle  but not to win. A deeper scrutiny detected lines of suffering in that  lovely face, and behind the veil of reserve, which pride forced her to  wear, appeared the anguish of a strong-willed woman burdened by a heavy  cross. No one would dare express pity or offer sympathy, for her whole  air repelled it, and in her gloomy eyes sat scorn of herself mingled  with defiance of the scorn of others. A strange, almost tragical-looking  woman, in spite of beauty, grace, and the cold sweetness of her manner.  A faint smile parted her lips as she greeted those about her, and as her  husband seated himself beside Lady Treherne, she lifted her head with a  long breath, and a singular expression of relief, as if a burden was  removed, and for the time being she was free. Sir Jasper was at her  side, and as she listened, her eye glanced from face to face.    \"Who is with you now?\" she asked, in a low, mellow voice that was  full of music.    \"My sister and my cousin are yonder. You may remember Tavia as a child,  she is little more now. Maurice is an invalid, but the finest fellow  breathing.\"    \"I understand,\" and Mrs. Snowdon's eyes softened with a sudden  glance of pity for one cousin and admiration for the other, for she  knew the facts.    \"Major Royston, my father's friend, and Frank Annon, my own. Do you know  him?\" asked Sir Jasper.    \"No.\"    \"Then allow me to make him happy by presenting him, may I?\"    \"Not now. I'd rather see your cousin.\"    \"Thanks, you are very kind. I'll bring him over.\"    \"Stay, let me go to him,\" began the lady, with more feeling in face and  voice than one would believe her capable of showing.    \"Pardon, it will offend him, he will not be pitied, or relinquish any  of the duties or privileges of a gentleman which he can possibly  perform. He is proud, we can understand the feeling, so let us humor  the poor fellow.\"    Mrs. Snowdon bowed silently, and Sir Jasper called out in his hearty,  blunt way, as if nothing was amiss with his cousin, \"Maurice, I've an  honor for you. Come and receive it.\"    Divining what it was, Treherne noiselessly crossed the room, and with no  sign of self-consciousness or embarrassment, was presented to the  handsome woman. Thinking his presence might be a restraint, Sir Jasper  went away. The instant his back was turned, a change came over both: an  almost grim expression replaced the suavity of Treherne's face, and Mrs.  Snowdon's smile faded suddenly, while a deep flush rose to her brow, as  her eyes questioned his beseechingly.    \"How dared you come?\" he asked below his breath.    \"The general insisted.\"    \"And you could not change his purpose; poor woman!\"    \"You will not be pitied, neither will I,\" and her eyes flashed; then the  fire was quenched in tears, and her voice lost all its pride in a  pleading tone.    \"Forgive me, I longed to see you since your illness, and so I  'dared' to come.\"    \"You shall be gratified; look, quite helpless, crippled for life,  perhaps.\"    The chair was turned from the groups about the fire, and as he spoke,  with a bitter laugh Treherne threw back the skin which covered his  knees, and showed her the useless limbs once so strong and fleet. She  shrank and paled, put out her hand to arrest him, and cried in an  indignant whisper, \"No, no, not that! You know I never meant such cruel  curiosity, such useless pain to both--\"    \"Be still, someone is coming,\" he returned inaudibly; adding aloud,  as he adjusted the skin and smoothed the rich fur as if speaking of  it, \"Yes, it is a very fine one, Jasper gave it to me. He spoils me,  like a dear, generous-hearted fellow as he is. Ah, Octavia, what can  I do for you?\"    \"Nothing, thank you. I want to recall myself to Mrs. Snowdon's memory,  if she will let me.\"    \"No need of that; I never forget happy faces and pretty pictures. Two  years ago I saw you at your first ball, and longed to be a girl again.\"    As she spoke, Mrs. Snowdon pressed the hand shyly offered, and smiled at  the spirited face before her, though the shadow in her own eyes deepened  as she met the bright glance of the girl.    \"How kind you were that night! I remember you let me chatter away about  my family, my cousin, and my foolish little affairs with the sweetest  patience, and made me very happy by your interest. I was homesick, and  Aunt could never bear to hear of those things. It was before your  marriage, and all the kinder, for you were the queen of the night, yet  had a word for poor little me.\"    Mrs. Snowdon was pale to the lips, and Maurice impatiently tapped the  arm of his chair, while the girl innocently chatted on.    \"I am sorry the general is such an invalid; yet I dare say you find  great happiness in taking care of him. It is so pleasant to be of use to  those we love.\" And as she spoke, Octavia leaned over her cousin to hand  him the glove he had dropped.    The affectionate smile that accompanied the act made the color deepen  again in Mrs. Snowdon's cheek, and lit a spark in her softened eyes. Her  lips curled and her voice was sweetly sarcastic as she answered, \"Yes,  it is charming to devote one's life to these dear invalids, and find  one's reward in their gratitude. Youth, beauty, health, and happiness  are small sacrifices if one wins a little comfort for the poor  sufferers.\"    The girl felt the sarcasm under the soft words and drew back with a  troubled face.    Maurice smiled, and glanced from one to the other, saying significantly,  \"Well for me that my little nurse loves her labor, and finds no  sacrifice in it. I am fortunate in my choice.\"    \"I trust it may prove so--\" Mrs. Snowdon got no further, for at that  moment dinner was announced, and Sir Jasper took her away. Annon  approached with him and offered his arm to Miss Treherne, but with an  air of surprise, and a little gesture of refusal, she said coldly:    \"My cousin always takes me in to dinner. Be good enough to escort the  major.\" And with her hand on the arm of the chair, she walked away with  a mischievous glitter in her eyes.    Annon frowned and fell back, saying sharply, \"Come, Major, what are you  doing there?\"    \"Making discoveries.\"          Chapter II      BYPLAY    A right splendid old dowager was Lady Treherne, in her black velvet and  point lace, as she sat erect and stately on a couch by the drawing-room  fire, a couch which no one dare occupy in her absence, or share  uninvited. The gentlemen were still over their wine, and the three  ladies were alone. My lady never dozed in public, Mrs. Snowdon never  gossiped, and Octavia never troubled herself to entertain any guests but  those of her own age, so long pauses fell, and conversation languished,  till Mrs. Snowdon roamed away into the library. As she disappeared, Lady  Treherne beckoned to her daughter, who was idly making chords at the  grand piano. Seating herself on the ottoman at her mother's feet, the  girl took the still handsome hand in her own and amused herself with  examining the old-fashioned jewels that covered it, a pretext for  occupying her telltale eyes, as she suspected what was coming.    \"My dear, I'm not pleased with you, and I tell you so at once, that you  may amend your fault,\" began Madame Mere in a tender tone, for though a  haughty, imperious woman, she idolized her children.    \"What have I done, Mamma?\" asked the girl.    \"Say rather, what have you left undone. You have been very rude to Mr.  Annon. It must not occur again; not only because he is a guest, but  because he is your--brother's friend.\"    My lady hesitated over the word \"lover,\" and changed it, for to her  Octavia still seemed a child, and though anxious for the alliance, she  forbore to speak openly, lest the girl should turn willful, as she  inherited her mother's high spirit.    \"I'm sorry, Mamma. But how can I help it, when he teases me so that I  detest him?\" said Octavia, petulantly.    \"How tease, my love?\"    \"Why, he follows me about like a dog, puts on a sentimental look when I  appear; blushes, and beams, and bows at everything I say, if I am  polite; frowns and sighs if I'm not; and glowers tragically at every man  I speak to, even poor Maurice. Oh, Mamma, what foolish creatures men  are!\" And the girl laughed blithely, as she looked up for the first time  into her mother's face.    My lady smiled, as she stroked the bright head at her knee, but asked  quickly, \"Why say 'even poor Maurice,' as if it were impossible for  anyone to be jealous of him?\"    \"But isn't it, Mamma? I thought strong, well men regarded him as one set  apart and done with, since his sad misfortune.\"    \"Not entirely; while women pity and pet the poor fellow, his comrades  will be jealous, absurd as it is.\"    \"No one pets him but me, and I have a right to do it, for he is my  cousin,\" said the girl, feeling a touch of jealousy herself.    \"Rose and Blanche Talbot outdo you, my dear, and there is no cousinship  to excuse them.\"    \"Then let Frank Annon be jealous of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1," exceptions are Angola, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia,  North Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 7  nations that are not in the UN-Andorra, Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland,  Tonga, and Tuvalu.    Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development  assistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are administered  with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs as their main  objective and are concessional in character and contain a grant element of at  least 25%, and other official flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector  whose main objective is other than development motivated or whose grant element  is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions include official export  credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment,  and debt reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional  terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are initialed by  the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration of intent.    Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,  and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are  not officially recognized by the US Government. \"Nation'' refers to a people  politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.  \"Dependent area\" refers to a broad category of political entities that are  associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually  the short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are  266 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:    NATIONS    182  UN members (excluding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose status  in the UN is unclear)    8  nations that are not members of the UN--Andorra, Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,  Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu    OTHER    1  Taiwan    DEPENDENT AREAS    6  Australia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling)  Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island    2  Denmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland    16  France--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island, French Guiana, French  Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe,  Juan de Nova Island, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre  and Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna    2  Netherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles    3  New Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau    3  Norway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard    1  Portugal--Macau    16  United Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory, British  Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong  Kong, Jersey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, South  Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands    15  United States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island, Jarvis  Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, Northern  Mariana Islands, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), Palmyra Atoll,  Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Wake Island    MISCELLANEOUS    6  Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West Bank, Western  Sahara    OTHER ENTITIES    4  oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean    1  World    266  total    note: The US Government does not recognize the four so-called independent  homelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.  Exchange rate: The value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over a  given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and  as determined by international market forces or official fiat.    Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and services produced  domestically in a given year.    Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and services produced  domestically in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by  foreigners from domestic production.    Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services  produced worldwide in a given year.    GNP/GDP methodology: In the \"Economy'' section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the  OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European countries are  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from  conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method normally  involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are applied to the  quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In addition to the  lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces a  major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the quality of  goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate in dollars by the  corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate. One  thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one  thousand dollars--converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate--  will buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other  hand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to  dollars at the official currency exchange rates. Because currency exchange rates  depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often  have little relation to domestic output, use of these rates is less satisfactory  for calculating GNP/GDP than the PPP method. Furthermore, exchange rates may  suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat  whereas real output has remained unchanged. One additional caution: the  proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local  currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP  accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates  the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures; similar problems  exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate  procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the PPP method, we  hope to convert all GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future editions of The  World Factbook.    Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting  from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.    Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,  stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These  categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well  as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,  Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish  (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant  cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and  is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.    Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include  chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),  benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide  (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or  behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in  physical,  mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and  emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,  buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,  angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others  (psilocybin, psilocyn).    Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).    Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.    Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,  opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium  (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol  w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic  narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic  narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone  (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).    Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium  poppy.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that is  chewed or drunk as tea.    Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity,  and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine),  phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,  Sanorex, Tenuate).    Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a  given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.
