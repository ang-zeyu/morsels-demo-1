[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#2)"],[1," with all its antiquity and greatness, spreads the Malabar Hill,  the residence of the modern Europeans and rich natives. Their brightly  painted bungalows are bathed in the greenery of banyan, Indian fig, and  various other trees, and the tall and straight trunks of cocoanut palms  cover with the fringe of their leaves the whole ridge of the hilly  headland. There, on the south-western end of the rock, you see the  almost transparent, lace-like Government House surrounded on three  sides by the ocean. This is the coolest and the most comfortable part of  Bombay, fanned by three different sea breezes.    The island of Bombay, designated by the natives \"Mambai,\" received its  name from the goddess Mamba, in Mahrati Mahima, or Amba, Mama, and Amma,  according to the dialect, a word meaning, literally, the Great Mother.  Hardly one hundred years ago, on the site of the modern esplanade, there  stood a temple consecrated to Mamba-Devi. With great difficulty and  expense they carried it nearer to the shore, close to the fort, and  erected it in front of Baleshwara the \"Lord of the Innocent\"--one of  the names of the god Shiva. Bombay is part of a considerable group of  islands, the most remarkable of which are Salsetta, joined to Bombay by  a mole, Elephanta, so named by the Portuguese because of a huge rock cut  in the shape of an elephant thirty-five feet long, and Trombay, whose  lovely rock rises nine hundred feet above the surface of the sea. Bombay  looks, on the maps, like an enormous crayfish, and is at the head of  the rest of the islands. Spreading far out into the sea its two claws,  Bombay island stands like a sleepless guardian watching over his younger  brothers. Between it and the Continent there is a narrow arm of a river,  which gets gradually broader and then again narrower, deeply indenting  the sides of both shores, and so forming a haven that has no equal in  the world. It was not without reason that the Portuguese, expelled in  the course of time by the English, used to call it \"Buona Bahia.\"    In a fit of tourist exaltation some travellers have compared it to the  Bay of Naples; but, as a matter of fact, the one is as much like the  other as a lazzaroni is like a Kuli. The whole resemblance between the  former consists in the fact that there is water in both. In Bombay, as  well as in its harbour, everything is original and does not in the least  remind one of Southern Europe. Look at those coasting vessels and native  boats; both are built in the likeness of the sea bird \"sat,\" a kind  of kingfisher. When in motion these boats are the personi-fication of  grace, with their long prows and rounded poops. They look as if they  were gliding backwards, and one might mistake for wings the strangely  shaped, long lateen sails, their narrow angles fastened upwards to a  yard. Filling these two wings with the wind, and careening, so as almost  to touch the surface of the water, these boats will fly along with  astonishing swiftness. Unlike our European boats, they do not cut the  waves, but glide over them like a sea-gull.    The surroundings of the bay transported us to some fairy land of the  Arabian Nights. The ridge of the Western Ghats, cut through here and  there by some separate hills almost as high as themselves, stretched all  along the Eastern shore. From the base to their fantastic, rocky tops,  they are all overgrown with impenetrable forests and jungles inhabited  by wild animals. Every rock has been enriched by the popular imagination  with an independent legend. All over the slope of the mountain are  scattered the pagodas, mosques, and temples of numberless sects. Here  and there the hot rays of the sun strike upon an old fortress, once  dreadful and inaccessible, now half ruined and covered with prickly  cactus. At every step some memorial of sanctity. Here a deep vihara,  a cave cell of a Buddhist bhikshu saint, there a rock protected by the  symbol of Shiva, further on a Jaina temple, or a holy tank, all covered  with sedge and filled with water, once blessed by a Brahman and able to  purify every sin, all indispensable attribute of all pagodas. All the  surroundings are covered with symbols of gods and goddesses. Each of the  three hundred and thirty millions of deities of the Hindu Pantheon has  its representative in something consecrated to it, a stone, a flower, a  tree, or a bird. On the West side of the Malabar Hill peeps through the  trees Valakeshvara, the temple of the \"Lord of Sand.\" A long stream of  Hindus moves towards this celebrated temple; men and women, shining with  rings on their fingers and toes, with bracelets from their wrists up  to their elbows, clad in bright turbans and snow white muslins, with  foreheads freshly painted with red, yellow, and white, holy sectarian  signs.    The legend says that Rama spent here a night on his way from Ayodhya  (Oudh) to Lanka (Ceylon) to fetch his wife Sita who had been stolen by  the wicked King Ravana. Rama's brother Lakshman, whose duty it was  to send him daily a new lingam from Benares, was late in doing so one  evening. Losing patience, Rama erected for himself a lingam of sand.  When, at last, the symbol arrived from Benares, it was put in a temple,  and the lingam erected by Rama was left on the shore. There it stayed  during long centuries, but, at the arrival of the Portuguese, the \"Lord  of Sand\" felt so disgusted with the feringhi (foreigners) that he jumped  into the sea never to return. A little farther on there is a charming  tank, called Vanattirtha, or the \"point of the arrow.\" Here Rama, the  much worshipped hero of the Hindus, felt thirsty and, not finding any  water, shot an arrow and immediately there was created a pond. Its  crystal waters were surrounded by a high wall, steps were built leading  down to it, and a circle of white marble dwellings was filled with dwija  (twice born) Brahmans.    India is the land of legends and of mysterious nooks and corners. There  is not a ruin, not a monument, not a thicket, that has no story attached  to it. Yet, however they may be entangled in the cobweb of popular  imagination, which becomes thicker with every generation, it is  difficult to point out a single one that is not founded on fact. With  patience and, still more, with the help of the learned Brahmans you  can always get at the truth, when once you have secured their trust and  friendship.    The same road leads to the temple of the Parsee fire-worshippers. At its  altar burns an unquenchable fire, which daily consumes hundredweights of  sandal wood and aromatic herbs. Lit three hundred years ago, the sacred  fire has never been extinguished, notwithstanding many disorders,  sectarian discords, and even wars. The Parsees are very proud of this  temple of Zaratushta, as they call Zoroaster. Compared with it the  Hindu pagodas look like brightly painted Easter eggs. Generally they are  consecrated to Hanuman, the monkey-god and the faithful ally of Rama, or  to the elephant headed Ganesha, the god of the occult wisdom, or to one  of the Devis. You meet with these temples in every street. Before each  there is a row of pipals (Ficus religiosa) centuries old, which no  temple can dispense with, because these trees are the abode of the  elementals and the sinful souls.    All this is entangled, mixed, and scattered, appearing to one's eyes  like a picture in a dream. Thirty centuries have left their traces  here. The innate laziness and the strong conservative tendencies of  the Hindus, even before the European invasion, preserved all kinds of  monuments from the ruinous vengeance of the fanatics, whether those  memorials were Buddhist, or belonged to some other unpopular sect.  The Hindus are not naturally given to senseless vandalism, and a  phrenologist would vainly look for a bump of destructiveness on their  skulls. If you meet with antiquities that, having been spared by time,  are, nowadays, either destroyed or disfigured, it is not they who are  to blame, but either Mussulmans, or the Portuguese under the guidance of  the Jesuits.    At last we were anchored and, in a moment, were besieged, ourselves as  well as our luggage, by numbers of naked skeleton-like Hindus, Parsees,  Moguls, and various other tribes. All this crowd emerged, as if from the  bottom of the sea, and began to shout, to chatter, and to yell, as only  the tribes of Asia can. To get rid of this Babel confusion of tongues as  soon as possible, we took refuge in the first bunder boat and made for  the shore.    Once settled in the bungalow awaiting us, the first thing we were struck  with in Bombay was the millions of crows and vultures. The first are, so  to speak, the County Council of the town, whose duty it is to clean the  streets, and to kill one of them is not only forbidden by the police,  but would be very dangerous. By killing one you would rouse the  vengeance of every Hindu, who is always ready to offer his own life in  exchange for a crow's. The souls of the sinful forefathers transmigrate  into crows and to kill one is to interfere with the law of Karma and  to expose the poor ancestor to something still worse. Such is the firm  belief, not only of Hindus, but of Parsees, even the most enlightened  amongst them. The strange behaviour of the Indian crows explains, to  a certain extent, this superstition. The vultures are, in a way, the  grave-diggers of the Parsees and are under the personal protection  of the Farvardania, the angel of death, who soars over the Tower of  Silence, watching the occupations of the feathered workmen.    The deafening caw of the crows strikes every new comer as uncanny, but,  after a while, is explained very simply. Every tree of the numerous  cocoa-nut forests round Bombay is provided with a hollow pumpkin. The  sap of the tree drops into it and, after fermenting, becomes a most  intoxicating beverage, known in Bombay under the name of toddy.

There are many such works  published for the use of English and American children.  But the  native African has a totally different experience of life, and much  that is taken for granted by a child of a Northern civilized land  needs explanation to one used to tropical uncivilized surroundings.  Again, the African knows the essential operations of everyday life in  their simplest form, whereas the European knows them disguised by an  elaborate industrial system. All this makes books written for English  children almost unintelligible to a member of a primitive race.  These two volumes are far from perfect, but it has been difficult to  know always how to select wisely from the mass of material at hand.  They will have served, however, a useful purpose if they form a basis  for adaptations into the various African vernaculars, and afford an  inspiration for other works of a similar nature.  Thanks are due to  Miss K. Nixon Smith, of the Universities Mission to Central Africa,  for her kindness in criticizing the MSS. from her long experience of  the African outlook.                                                              EDITH A. HOW  _June_, 1920.                                      I                               -----------                               INTRODUCTION    In this book we are going to read about some of the other people who  live in our own great country--Africa.  Africa is very, very large, so  big that no one would be able to go to all the places in it.  But  different people have been to different parts, and have told what they  saw where they went.  Wherever our home in Africa may be, if we walked  towards the sunrise--that is, towards the east--day after day, at last  we should reach the great salt sea.  Again, if we walked towards the  sunset in the west, we should at last get to the sea.  To the north,  again, is the sea, and to the south, the sea.  Whichever way we  walked, at last, after many months, we should be stopped by the sea.  But on our journey we should have met many different kinds of people,  and have seen many different customs.  In some places there would be  rivers, in some mountains, in some deserts, with no trees or grass to  be seen.  In these, people must make their homes in many ways, and  have many kinds of food and clothes.  Because we live in Africa, we  want to know about Africa and the people in it.  They are men and  women and children like ourselves, though the colour of their skins  may be lighter or darker than ours, and their languages quite  different.  But they, too, build houses and eat food and wear some  kind of dress, and it is interesting to know about their customs.  So  in this book we shall read about some of them and of how they live;  and, to help us to understand, we shall find with each part a picture  of the people we are reading about.  All the time we must remember  that we could get to see them for ourselves if we were strong enough  to walk so far, because they are all our own brothers and sisters in  Africa.    Long ago most African peoples were shut off from the other people of  the world by the sea and the great sandy desert.  Only the people of  Egypt could meet and learn from the people of Europe and Asia.  So  while the Egyptians grew wise and clever, all the other Africans,  south of the desert, knew nothing except what they had learnt by  themselves.  Then Arabs began to cross the desert to get gold and  slaves from the dark-skinned Africans.  These Arabs taught them a  little.  But, later still, Europeans began to come in great ships over  the sea.  These came at first like the Arabs to trade, and afterwards  began to plant great fields of cotton and tobacco, which will not grow  in their own lands.  But they found the dark-skinned Africans were  still ignorant, and afraid of people of other races.  They were always  fighting among themselves, and no one could settle among them until  there was peace and safety.  At last the European nations made  agreements with the chiefs, so that now in nearly every part of Africa  there is a European governor to prevent wars and fighting.  Thus in  North Africa the governors are sent by France, in the Congo lands by  Belgium, in East Africa by England, in some other parts by Portugal.  These are different European nations who send men to keep peace, and  to make it possible to carry on trade.  Of course, the coming of the  Europeans has made great changes in the lives of the Africans.  In the  old times all the men were busy fighting, and often whole villages of  people were killed or made slaves.  Now there is no fighting, but  there is more need to work than before.  There are more people, and  less land for each family.  Europeans want workmen to help on their  great fields.  The Africans want many things now, which they did not  know about before, and they must have money to buy them.  So work for  money has taken the place of fighting.  Again, in some ways the  Europeans, enforcing peace and making many quick ways of travel, such  as good roads and bridges, have helped to weaken the power of the  chiefs.  Nobody likes changes to come, and the old people are always  sorry when their children begin new customs; but on the whole it is  good for Africans that other nations came to their country, because  they have brought peace in the place of war, and safety and freedom  instead of the old fear of death or slavery.                                      II                               -----------                                  EGYPT                         1. The Country and its River    Egypt is a country in the north of Africa.  It has sea to the north  and sea to the east.  On the north it is called the Mediterranean Sea,  and on the east the Red Sea.  On the west is the great sandy desert  called the Sahara, and to the south are great forests and mountains.  Egypt itself is the land of the great River Nile.  There is very  seldom any rain there, and everyone has to get water from the great  river.  So all the people live near the Nile or the canals which lead  out of it.  A \"canal\" is a waterway, the channel of which has been dug  by men.  The big towns are where the river flows out into the sea, or  where a canal meets the main stream, because the people bring their  merchandise to market in boats.  All over the land are little  villages, where many people live and work in the fields to grow food.  Year by year when there is heavy rain in the mountains far away south,  the River Nile rises and floods the fields.  Then the people plant  their seed quickly and get a good harvest.  It is not difficult to  understand why the Egyptians love their great river, which gives them  water for their fields and carries them in their boats from place to  place.                             2. Its Past History    Egypt is the only part of Africa that could be reached easily by  people in Europe and Asia, because in Egypt is the only place where  men could walk from Asia and Europe into Africa.  Even if they did not  want to walk, the sea was not too wide to cross in small boats.  In  the Bible we read how Abraham, who lived in Asia, walked to Egypt, and  later how Moses led the Children of Israel back to Asia.  Since that  time Europeans have cut a waterway for ships through this narrow neck  of land, which is called the Suez Canal.  So now people can no longer  walk from Asia to Africa, but in the old days the Egyptians grew wiser  than others in Africa, because they were more able to meet men from  other lands in Asia and Europe, and to learn something from them all.  So hundreds and hundreds of years ago there were people living in this  country of the Nile who were wise and great.  They built large cities  and temples and houses."]]]
