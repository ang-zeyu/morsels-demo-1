And from that cloud showered these hot, pelting pebbles of pumice stone.    \"It is a volcano,\" cried Ariston.    He had seen one spouting fire as he had voyaged on the pirate ship.    \"I want my father,\" wailed the little boy.    Then Ariston remembered that his master was away from home. He had gone  in a ship to Rome to get a great physician for his sick boy. He had left  Caius in the charge of his nurse, for the boy's mother was dead. But  now every slave had turned coward and had run away and left the little  master to die.    Ariston pulled the couch into one of the rooms. Here the roof kept off  the hail of stones.    \"Your father is expected home to-day, master Caius,\" said the Greek. \"He  will come. He never breaks his word. We will wait for him here. This  strange shower will soon be over.\"    So he sat on the edge of the couch, and the little Roman laid his head  in his slave's lap and sobbed. Ariston watched the falling pebbles. They  were light and full of little holes. Every now and then black rocks of  the size of his head whizzed through the air. Sometimes one fell into  the open cistern and the water hissed at its heat. The pebbles lay piled  a foot deep all over the courtyard floor. And still they fell thick and  fast.    \"Will it never stop?\" thought Ariston.    Several times the ground swayed under him. It felt like the moving of a  ship in a storm. Once there was thunder and a trembling of the house.  Ariston was looking at a little bronze statue that stood on a tall,  slender column. It tottered to and fro in the earthquake. Then it fell,  crashing into the piled-up stones. In a few minutes the falling shower  had covered it.    Ariston began to be more afraid. He thought of Death as he had painted  him in his picture. He imagined that he saw him hiding behind a column.  He thought he heard his cruel laugh. He tried to look up toward the  mountain, but the stones pelted him down. He felt terribly alone. Was  all the rest of the world dead? Or was every one else in some safe  place?    \"Come, Caius, we must get away,\" he cried. \"We shall be buried here.\"    He snatched up one of the blankets from the couch. He threw the ends  over his shoulders and let a loop hang at his back. He stood the sick  boy in this and wound the ends around them both. Caius was tied to his  slave's back. His heavy little head hung on Ariston's shoulder. Then the  Greek tied a pillow over his own head. He snatched up a staff and ran  from the house. He looked at his picture as he passed. He thought he  saw Death half rise from the ground. But Apollo seemed to smile at his  artist.    At the front door Ariston stumbled. He found the street piled deep with  the gray, soft pebbles. He had to scramble up on his hands and knees.  From the house opposite ran a man. He looked wild with fear. He was  clutching a little statue of gold. Ariston called to him, \"Which way to  the gate?\"    But the man did not hear. He rushed madly on. Ariston followed him. It  cheered the boy a little to see that somebody else was still alive in  the world. But he had a hard task. He could not run. The soft pebbles  crunched under his feet and made him stumble. He leaned far forward  under his heavy burden. The falling shower scorched his bare arms and  legs. Once a heavy stone struck him on his cushioned head, and he fell.  But he was up in an instant. He looked around bewildered. His head was  ringing. The air was hot and choking. The sun was gone. The shower was  blinding. Whose house was this? The door stood open. The court was  empty. Where was the city gate? Would he never get out? He did not know  this street. Here on the corner was a wine shop with its open sides. But  no men stood there drinking. Wine cups were tipped over and broken on  the marble counter. Ariston stood in a daze and watched the wine  spilling into the street.    Then a crowd came rushing past him. It was evidently a family fleeing  for their lives. Their mouths were open as though they were crying. But  Ariston could not hear their voices. His ears shook with the roar of the  mountain. An old man was hugging a chest. Gold coins were spilling out  as he ran. Another man was dragging a fainting woman. A young girl ran  ahead of them with white face and streaming hair. Ariston stumbled on  after this company. A great black slave came swiftly around a corner and  ran into him and knocked him over, but fled on without looking back. As  the Greek boy fell forward, the rough little pebbles scoured his face.  He lay there moaning. Then he began to forget his troubles. His aching  body began to rest. He thought he would sleep. He saw Apollo smiling.  Then Caius struggled and cried out. He pulled at the blanket and tried  to free himself. This roused Ariston, and he sat up. He felt the hot  pebbles again. He heard the mountain roar. He dragged himself to his  feet and started on. Suddenly the street led him out into a broad space.  Ariston looked around him. All about stretched wide porches with their  columns. Temple roofs rose above them. Statues stood high on their  pedestals. He was in the forum. The great open square was crowded with  hurrying people. Under one of the porches Ariston saw the money changers  locking their boxes. From a wide doorway ran several men. They were  carrying great bundles of woolen cloth, richly embroidered and dyed  with precious purple. Down the great steps of Jupiter's temple ran a  priest. Under his arms he clutched two large platters of gold. Men were  running across the forum dragging bags behind them.    Every one seemed trying to save his most precious things. And every one  was hurrying to the gate at the far end. Then that was the way out!  Ariston picked up his heavy feet and ran. Suddenly the earth swayed  under him. He heard horrible thunder. He thought the mountain was  falling upon him. He looked behind. He saw the columns of the porch  tottering. A man was running out from one of the buildings. But as he  ran, the walls crashed down. The gallery above fell cracking. He was  buried. Ariston saw it all and cried out in horror. Then he prayed:    \"O Lord Poseidon, shaker of the earth, save me! I am a Greek!\"    Then he came out of the forum. A steep street sloped down to a gate. A  river of people was pouring out there. The air was full of cries. The  great noise of the crowd made itself heard even in the noise of the  volcano. The streets were full of lost treasures. Men pushed and fell  and were trodden upon. But at last Ariston passed through the gateway  and was out of the city. He looked about.    \"It is no better,\" he sobbed to himself.    The air was thicker now. The shower had changed to hot dust as fine  as ashes. It blurred his eyes. It stopped his nostrils. It choked his  lungs. He tore his chiton from top to bottom and wrapped it about his  mouth and nose. He looked back at Caius and pulled the blanket over his  head. Behind him a huge cloud was reaching out long black arms from the  mountain to catch him. Ahead, the sun was only a red wafer in the shower  of ashes. Around him people were running off to hide under rocks or  trees or in the country houses. Some were running, running anywhere to  get away. Out of one courtyard dashed a chariot. The driver was lashing  his horses. He pushed them ahead through the crowd. He knocked people  over, but he did not stop to see what harm he had done. Curses flew  after him. He drove on down the road.    Ariston remembered when he himself had been dragged up here two years  ago from the pirate ship.    \"This leads to the sea,\" he thought. \"I will go there. Perhaps I shall  meet my master, Tetreius. He will come by ship. Surely I shall find him.  The gods will send him to me. O blessed gods!\"    But what a sea! It roared and tossed and boiled. While Ariston looked,  a ship was picked up and crushed and swallowed. The sea poured up the  steep shore for hundreds of feet. Then it rushed back and left its  strange fish gasping on the dry land. Great rocks fell from the sky,  and steam rose up as they splashed into the water. The sun was growing  fainter. The black cloud was coming on. Soon it would be dark. And then  what? Ariston lay down where the last huge wave had cooled the ground.  \"It is all over, Caius,\" he murmured. \"I shall never see Athens again.\"    For a while there were no more earthquakes. The sea grew a little less  wild. Then the half-fainting Ariston heard shouts. He lifted his head.  A small boat had come ashore. The rowers had leaped out. They were  dragging it up out of reach of the waves.    \"How strange!\" thought Ariston. \"They are not running away. They must be  brave. We are all cowards.\"    \"Wait for me here!\" cried a lordly voice to the rowers.    When he heard that voice Ariston struggled to his feet and called.    \"Marcus Tetreius! Master!\"    He saw the man turn and run toward him. Then the boy toppled over and  lay face down in the ashes.    When he came to himself he felt a great shower of water in his face. The  burden was gone from his back. He was lying in a row boat, and the boat  was falling to the bottom of the sea. Then it was flung up to the skies.  Tetreius was shouting orders. The rowers were streaming with sweat and  sea water.    In some way or other they all got up on the waiting ship. It always  seemed to Ariston as though a wave had thrown him there. Or had Poseidon  carried him? At any rate, the great oars of the galley were flying. He  could hear every rower groan as he pulled at his oar. The sails, too,  were spread. The master himself stood at the helm. His face was one  great frown. The boat was flung up and down like a ball. Then fell  darkness blacker than night.    \"Who can steer without sun or stars?\" thought the boy.    Then he remembered the look on his master's face as he stood at the  tiller. Such a look Ariston had painted on Herakles' face as he  strangled "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#2)"],[1,"row  except when we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were  going through those dismal things which people call Conditional  Sentences, and we were told to make a conditional sentence, expressing a  future consequence. We did it, right or wrong, and showed up our bits of  paper, and Sampson began looking through them. All at once he got up,  made some odd sort of noise in his throat, and rushed out by a door that  was just by his desk. We sat there for a minute or two, and then--I  suppose it was incorrect--but we went up, I and one or two others, to  look at the papers on his desk. Of course I thought someone must have put  down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had gone off to report him. All  the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of the papers with him when  he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was written in red ink--which  no one used--and it wasn't in anyone's hand who was in the class. They  all looked at it--McLeod and all--and took their dying oaths that it  wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of paper. And of this  I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of paper on the  desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra paper, and  kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to know what  was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I should  have said.    '\"_Si tu non veneris ad me, ego veniam ad te_,\" which means, I suppose,  \"If you don't come to me, I'll come to you.\"'    'Could you show me the paper?' interrupted the listener.    'Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same  afternoon I took it out of my locker--I know for certain it was the same  bit, for I made a finger-mark on it--and no single trace of writing of  any kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I  have tried various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been  used, but absolutely without result.    'So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said  he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly  to his desk and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose  he thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.    'That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,  much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story  happened.    'We--McLeod and I--slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main  building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There  was a very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but  some time between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It  was McLeod; and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. \"Come,\" he  said,--\"come! there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window.\" As  soon as I could speak, I said, \"Well, why not call out and wake everybody  up?\" \"No, no,\" he said, \"I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come  and look.\" Naturally I came and looked, and naturally there was no one  there. I was cross enough, and should have called McLeod plenty of names:  only--I couldn't tell why--it seemed to me that there _was_ something  wrong--something that made me very glad I wasn't alone to face it. We  were still at the window looking out, and as soon as I could, I asked him  what he had heard or seen. \"I didn't _hear_ anything at all,\" he said,  \"but about five minutes before I woke you, I found myself looking out of  this window here, and there was a man sitting or kneeling on Sampson's  window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was beckoning.\" \"What sort  of man?\" McLeod wriggled. \"I don't know,\" he said, \"but I can tell you  one thing--he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he was wet all over:  and,\" he said, looking round and whispering as if he hardly liked to hear  himself, \"I'm not at all sure that he was alive.\"    'We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept  back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I  believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.    'And next day Mr Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no  trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of  the oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that  neither McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person  whatever. Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they  had been, I am inclined to believe that we could not have made any  answer: we seemed unable to speak about it.    'That is my story,' said the narrator. 'The only approach to a ghost  story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an  approach to such a thing.'           *       *       *       *       *    The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a  sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one  listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of  the next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.    One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in  the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. 'Now,' he  said, 'you know about old things; tell me what that is.' My friend opened  the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached  to it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to  examine it more narrowly. 'What's the history of this?' he asked. 'Odd  enough,' was the answer. 'You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery:  well, a year or two back we were cleaning out the old well that used to  be in the clearing here, and what do you suppose we found?'    'Is it possible that you found a body?' said the visitor, with an odd  feeling of nervousness.    'We did that: but what's more, in every sense of the word, we found two.'    'Good Heavens! Two? Was there anything to show how they got there? Was  this thing found with them?'    'It was. Amongst the rags of the clothes that were on one of the bodies.  A bad business, whatever the story of it may have been. One body had the  arms tight round the other. They must have been there thirty years or  more--long enough before we came to this place. You may judge we filled  the well up fast enough. Do you make anything of what's cut on that gold  coin you have there?'    'I think I can,' said my friend, holding it to the light (but he read it  without much difficulty); 'it seems to be G.W.S., 24 July, 1865.'          THE ROSE GARDEN    Mr and Mrs Anstruther were at breakfast in the parlour of Westfield Hall,  in the county of Essex. They were arranging plans for the day.    'George,' said Mrs Anstruther, 'I think you had better take the car to  Maldon and see if you can get any of those knitted things I was speaking  about which would do for my stall at the bazaar.'    'Oh well, if you wish it, Mary, of course I can do that, but I had half  arranged to play a round with Geoffrey Williamson this morning. The  bazaar isn't till Thursday of next week, is it?'    'What has that to do with it, George? I should have thought you would  have guessed that if I can't get the things I want in Maldon I shall have  to write to all manner of shops in town: and they are certain to send  something quite unsuitable in price or quality the first time. If you  have actually made an appointment with Mr Williamson, you had better keep  it, but I must say I think you might have let me know.'    'Oh no, no, it wasn't really an appointment. I quite see what you mean.  I'll go. And what shall you do yourself?'    'Why, when the work of the house is arranged for, I must see about laying  out my new rose garden. By the way, before you start for Maldon I wish  you would just take Collins to look at the place I fixed upon. You know  it, of course.'    'Well, I'm not quite sure that I do, Mary. Is it at the upper end,  towards the village?'    'Good gracious no, my dear George; I thought I had made that quite clear.  No, it's that small clearing just off the shrubbery path that goes  towards the church.'    'Oh yes, where we were saying there must have been a summer-house once:  the place with the old seat and the posts. But do you think there's  enough sun there?'    'My dear George, do allow me _some_ common sense, and don't credit me  with all your ideas about summer-houses. Yes, there will be plenty of sun  when we have got rid of some of those box-bushes. I know what you are  going to say, and I have as little wish as you to strip the place bare.  All I want Collins to do is to clear away the old seats and the posts and  things before I come out in an hour's time. And I hope you will manage to  get off fairly soon. After luncheon I think I shall go on with my sketch  of the church; and if you please you can go over to the links, or--'    'Ah, a good idea--very good! Yes, you finish that sketch, Mary, and I  should be glad of a round.'    'I was going to say, you might call on the Bishop; but I suppose it is no  use my making _any_ suggestion. And now do be getting ready, or half the  morning will be gone.'    Mr Anstruther's face, which had shown symptoms of lengthening, shortened  itself again, and he hurried from the room, and was soon heard giving  orders in the passage. Mrs Anstruther, a stately dame of some fifty  summers, proceeded, after a second consideration of the morning's  letters, to her housekeeping.    Within a few minutes Mr Anstruther had discovered Collins in the  greenhouse, and they were on their way to the site of the projected rose  garden. I do not know much about the conditions most suitable to these  nurseries, but I am inclined to believe that Mrs Anstruther, though in  the habit of describing herself as 'a great gardener', had not been well  advised in the selection of a spot for the purpose. It was a small, dank  clearing, bounded on one side by a path, and"]]]
