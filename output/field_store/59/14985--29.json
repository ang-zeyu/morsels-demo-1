Nevertheless, come on, and I will strive my best to serve you all.\"    \"Stop!\" cried Robin Hood, \"we will fight no more.  I take my vow, this  is an ill day for thee and me, Little John.  I do verily believe that my  wrist, and eke my arm, are palsied by the jar of the blow that this  stranger struck me.\"    Then Little John turned to Robin Hood.  \"Why, how now, good master,\"  said he.  \"Alas!  Thou art in an ill plight. Marry, thy jerkin is all  befouled with the dust of the road. Let me help thee to arise.\"    \"A plague on thy aid!\" cried Robin angrily.  \"I can get to my feet  without thy help, good fellow.\"    \"Nay, but let me at least dust thy coat for thee.  I fear thy poor bones  are mightily sore,\" quoth Little John soberly, but with a sly twinkle in  his eyes.    \"Give over, I say!\" quoth Robin in a fume.  \"My coat hath been dusted  enough already, without aid of thine.\"  Then, turning to the stranger,  he said, \"What may be thy name, good fellow?\"    \"My name is Gamwell,\" answered the other.    \"Ha!\" cried Robin, \"is it even so?  I have near kin of that name. Whence  camest thou, fair friend?\"    \"From Maxfield Town I come,\" answered the stranger. \"There was I born  and bred, and thence I come to seek my mother's young brother, whom men  call Robin Hood.  So, if perchance thou mayst direct me--\"    \"Ha!  Will Gamwell!\" cried Robin, placing both hands upon the other's  shoulders and holding him off at arm's length. \"Surely, it can be none  other!  I might have known thee by that pretty maiden air of thine--that  dainty, finicking manner of gait. Dost thou not know me, lad?  Look upon  me well.\"    \"Now, by the breath of my body!\" cried the other, \"I do believe from my  heart that thou art mine own Uncle Robin.  Nay, certain it is so!\" And  each flung his arms around the other, kissing him upon the cheek.    Then once more Robin held his kinsman off at arm's length and scanned  him keenly from top to toe.  \"Why, how now,\" quoth he, \"what change is  here?  Verily, some eight or ten years ago I left thee a stripling lad,  with great joints and ill-hung limbs, and lo! here thou art, as tight a  fellow as e'er I set mine eyes upon. Dost thou not remember, lad, how I  showed thee the proper way to nip the goose feather betwixt thy fingers  and throw out thy bow arm steadily?  Thou gayest great promise of being  a keen archer. And dost thou not mind how I taught thee to fend and  parry with the cudgel?\"    \"Yea,\" said young Gamwell, \"and I did so look up to thee, and thought  thee so above all other men that, I make my vow, had I known who thou  wert, I would never have dared to lift hand against thee this day. I  trust I did thee no great harm.\"    \"No, no,\" quoth Robin hastily, and looking sideways at Little John,  \"thou didst not harm me.  But say no more of that, I prythee. Yet I will  say, lad, that I hope I may never feel again such a blow as thou didst  give me.  By'r Lady, my arm doth tingle yet from fingernail to elbow.  Truly, I thought that I was palsied for life. I tell thee, coz, that  thou art the strongest man that ever I laid mine eyes upon.  I take my  vow, I felt my stomach quake when I beheld thee pluck up yon green tree  as thou didst. But tell me, how camest thou to leave Sir Edward and thy  mother?\"    \"Alas!\" answered young Gamwell, \"it is an ill story, uncle, that I have  to tell thee.  My father's steward, who came to us after old Giles  Crookleg died, was ever a saucy varlet, and I know not why my father  kept him, saving that he did oversee with great judgment. It used to  gall me to hear him speak up so boldly to my father, who, thou knowest,  was ever a patient man to those about him, and slow to anger and harsh  words.  Well, one day--and an ill day it was for that saucy fellow--he  sought to berate my father, I standing by. I could stand it no longer,  good uncle, so, stepping forth, I gave him a box o' the ear, and--  wouldst thou believe it?--the fellow straightway died o't. I think they  said I broke his neck, or something o' the like.  So off they packed me  to seek thee and escape the law. I was on my way when thou sawest me,  and here I am.\"    \"Well, by the faith of my heart,\" quoth Robin Hood, \"for anyone escaping  the law, thou wast taking it the most easily that ever I beheld in all  my life.  Whenever did anyone in all the world see one who had slain a  man, and was escaping because of it, tripping along the highway like a  dainty court damsel, sniffing at a rose the while?\"    \"Nay, uncle,\" answered Will Gamwell, \"overhaste never churned good  butter, as the old saying hath it.  Moreover, I do verily believe that  this overstrength of my body hath taken the nimbleness out of my heels.  Why, thou didst but just now rap me thrice, and I thee never a once,  save by overbearing thee by my strength.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin, \"let us say no more on that score. I am right glad  to see thee, Will, and thou wilt add great honor and credit to my band  of merry fellows.  But thou must change thy name, for warrants will be  out presently against thee; so, because of thy gay clothes, thou shalt  henceforth and for aye be called Will Scarlet.\"    \"Will Scarlet,\" quoth Little John, stepping forward and reaching out his  great palm, which the other took, \"Will Scarlet, the name fitteth thee  well. Right glad am I to welcome thee among us.  I am called Little  John; and this is a new member who has just joined us, a stout tanner  named Arthur a Bland.  Thou art like to achieve fame, Will, let me tell  thee, for there will be many a merry ballad sung about the country, and  many a merry story told in Sherwood of how Robin Hood taught Little John  and Arthur a Bland the proper way to use the quarterstaff; likewise, as  it were, how our good master bit off so large a piece of cake that he  choked on it.\"    \"Nay, good Little John,\" quoth Robin gently, for he liked ill to have  such a jest told of him.  \"Why should we speak of this little matter?  Prythee, let us keep this day's doings among ourselves.\"    \"With all my heart,\" quoth Little John.  \"But, good master, I thought  that thou didst love a merry story, because thou hast so often made a  jest about a certain increase of fatness on my joints, of flesh gathered  by my abiding with the Sheriff of--\"    \"Nay, good Little John,\" said Robin hastily, \"I do bethink me I have  said full enough on that score.\"    \"It is well,\" quoth Little John, \"for in truth I myself have tired of it  somewhat.  But now I bethink me, thou didst also seem minded to make a  jest of the rain that threatened last night; so--\"    \"Nay, then,\" said Robin Hood testily, \"I was mistaken. I remember me now  it did seem to threaten rain.\"    \"Truly, I did think so myself,\" quoth Little John, \"therefore, no doubt,  thou dost think it was wise of me to abide all night at the Blue Boar  Inn, instead of venturing forth in such stormy weather; dost thou not?\"    \"A plague of thee and thy doings!\" cried Robin Hood.  \"If thou wilt have  it so, thou wert right to abide wherever thou didst choose.\"    \"Once more, it is well,\" quoth Little John.  \"As for myself, I have been  blind this day.  I did not see thee drubbed; I did not see thee tumbled  heels over head in the dust; and if any man says that thou wert, I can  with a clear conscience rattle his lying tongue betwixt his teeth.\"    \"Come,\" cried Robin, biting his nether lip, while the others could not  forbear laughing.  \"We will go no farther today, but will return to  Sherwood, and thou shalt go to Ancaster another time, Little John.\"    So said Robin, for now that his bones were sore, he felt as though a  long journey would be an ill thing for him.  So, turning their backs,  they retraced their steps whence they came.          The Adventure with Midge the Miller's Son    WHEN THE four yeomen had traveled for a long time toward Sherwood again,  high noontide being past, they began to wax hungry. Quoth Robin Hood, \"I  would that I had somewhat to eat. Methinks a good loaf of white bread,  with a piece of snow-white cheese, washed down with a draught of humming  ale, were a feast for a king.\"    \"Since thou speakest of it,\" said Will Scarlet, \"methinks it would not  be amiss myself.  There is that within me crieth out, 'Victuals, good  friend, victuals!'\"    \"I know a house near by,\" said Arthur a Bland, \"and, had I but the  money, I would bring ye that ye speak of; to wit, a sweet loaf of bread,  a fair cheese, and a skin of brown ale.\"    \"For the matter of that, thou knowest I have money by me, good master,\"  quoth Little John.    \"Why, so thou hast, Little John,\" said Robin.  \"How much money will it  take, good Arthur, to buy us meat and drink?\"    \"I think that six broad pennies will buy food enow for a dozen men,\"  said the Tanner.    \"Then give him six pennies, Little John,\" quoth Robin, \"for methinks  food for three men will about fit my need. Now get thee gone, Arthur,  with the money, and bring the food here, for there is a sweet shade in  that thicket yonder, beside the road, and there will we eat our meal.\"    So Little John gave Arthur the money, and the others stepped to the  thicket, there to await the return of the Tanner.    After a time he came back, bearing with him a great brown loaf of bread,  and a fair, round cheese, and a goatskin full of stout March beer, slung  over his shoulders.  Then Will Scarlet took his sword and divided the  loaf and the cheese into four fair portions, and each man helped  himself.  Then Robin Hood took a deep pull at the beer. \"Aha!\" said he,  drawing in his breath, \"never have I tasted sweeter drink than this.\"    After this no man spake more, but each munched away at his bread and  cheese lustily, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#20)"],[1,"found a ford. Henry led the way, the pony approaching the bank  with a countenance of cool indifference, bracing his feet and sliding  into the stream with the most unmoved composure.         At the first plunge the horse sunk low,       And the water broke o'er the saddle-bow    We followed; the water boiled against our saddles, but our horses bore  us easily through. The unfortunate little mules came near going down  with the current, cart and all; and we watched them with some solicitude  scrambling over the loose round stones at the bottom, and bracing  stoutly against the stream. All landed safely at last; we crossed a  little plain, descended a hollow, and riding up a steep bank found  ourselves before the gateway of Fort Laramie, under the impending  blockhouse erected above it to defend the entrance.        CHAPTER IX    SCENES AT FORT LARAMIE      Looking back, after the expiration of a year, upon Fort Laramie and its  inmates, they seem less like a reality than like some fanciful picture  of the olden time; so different was the scene from any which this tamer  side of the world can present. Tall Indians, enveloped in their white  buffalo robes, were striding across the area or reclining at full length  on the low roofs of the buildings which inclosed it. Numerous squaws,  gayly bedizened, sat grouped in front of the apartments they occupied;  their mongrel offspring, restless and vociferous, rambled in every  direction through the fort; and the trappers, traders, and ENGAGES of  the establishment were busy at their labor or their amusements.    We were met at the gate, but by no means cordially welcomed. Indeed,  we seemed objects of some distrust and suspicion until Henry Chatillon  explained that we were not traders, and we, in confirmation, handed to  the bourgeois a letter of introduction from his principals. He took  it, turned it upside down, and tried hard to read it; but his literary  attainments not being adequate to the task, he applied for relief to  the clerk, a sleek, smiling Frenchman, named Montalon. The letter read,  Bordeaux (the bourgeois) seemed gradually to awaken to a sense of what  was expected of him. Though not deficient in hospitable intentions, he  was wholly unaccustomed to act as master of ceremonies. Discarding all  formalities of reception, he did not honor us with a single word, but  walked swiftly across the area, while we followed in some admiration to  a railing and a flight of steps opposite the entrance. He signed to us  that we had better fasten our horses to the railing; then he walked  up the steps, tramped along a rude balcony, and kicking open a door  displayed a large room, rather more elaborately finished than a barn.  For furniture it had a rough bedstead, but no bed; two chairs, a chest  of drawers, a tin pail to hold water, and a board to cut tobacco upon. A  brass crucifix hung on the wall, and close at hand a recent scalp, with  hair full a yard long, was suspended from a nail. I shall again have  occasion to mention this dismal trophy, its history being connected with  that of our subsequent proceedings.    This apartment, the best in Fort Laramie, was that usually occupied by  the legitimate bourgeois, Papin; in whose absence the command devolved  upon Bordeaux. The latter, a stout, bluff little fellow, much inflated  by a sense of his new authority, began to roar for buffalo robes. These  being brought and spread upon the floor formed our beds; much better  ones than we had of late been accustomed to. Our arrangements made, we  stepped out to the balcony to take a more leisurely survey of the long  looked-for haven at which we had arrived at last. Beneath us was the  square area surrounded by little rooms, or rather cells, which opened  upon it. These were devoted to various purposes, but served chiefly for  the accommodation of the men employed at the fort, or of the equally  numerous squaws, whom they were allowed to maintain in it. Opposite to  us rose the blockhouse above the gateway; it was adorned with a figure  which even now haunts my memory; a horse at full speed, daubed upon  the boards with red paint, and exhibiting a degree of skill which might  rival that displayed by the Indians in executing similar designs upon  their robes and lodges. A busy scene was enacting in the area. The  wagons of Vaskiss, an old trader, were about to set out for a remote  post in the mountains, and the Canadians were going through their  preparations with all possible bustle, while here and there an Indian  stood looking on with imperturbable gravity.    Fort Laramie is one of the posts established by the American Fur  Company, who well-nigh monopolize the Indian trade of this whole region.  Here their officials rule with an absolute sway; the arm of the United  States has little force; for when we were there, the extreme outposts  of her troops were about seven hundred miles to the eastward. The little  fort is built of bricks dried in the sun, and externally is of an oblong  form, with bastions of clay, in the form of ordinary blockhouses, at two  of the corners. The walls are about fifteen feet high, and surmounted by  a slender palisade. The roofs of the apartments within, which are built  close against the walls, serve the purpose of a banquette. Within,  the fort is divided by a partition; on one side is the square area  surrounded by the storerooms, offices, and apartments of the inmates;  on the other is the corral, a narrow place, encompassed by the high clay  walls, where at night, or in presence of dangerous Indians, the horses  and mules of the fort are crowded for safe-keeping. The main entrance  has two gates, with an arched passage intervening. A little square  window, quite high above the ground, opens laterally from an adjoining  chamber into this passage; so that when the inner gate is closed and  barred, a person without may still hold communication with those within  through this narrow aperture. This obviates the necessity of admitting  suspicious Indians, for purposes of trading, into the body of the fort;  for when danger is apprehended, the inner gate is shut fast, and all  traffic is carried on by means of the little window. This precaution,  though highly necessary at some of the company's posts, is now seldom  resorted to at Fort Laramie; where, though men are frequently killed in  its neighborhood, no apprehensions are now entertained of any general  designs of hostility from the Indians.    We did not long enjoy our new quarters undisturbed. The door was  silently pushed open, and two eyeballs and a visage as black as night  looked in upon us; then a red arm and shoulder intruded themselves, and  a tall Indian, gliding in, shook us by the hand, grunted his salutation,  and sat down on the floor. Others followed, with faces of the natural  hue; and letting fall their heavy robes from their shoulders, they took  their seats, quite at ease, in a semicircle before us. The pipe was now  to be lighted and passed round from one to another; and this was the  only entertainment that at present they expected from us. These visitors  were fathers, brothers, or other relatives of the squaws in the  fort, where they were permitted to remain, loitering about in perfect  idleness. All those who smoked with us were men of standing and repute.  Two or three others dropped in also; young fellows who neither by their  years nor their exploits were entitled to rank with the old men and  warriors, and who, abashed in the presence of their superiors, stood  aloof, never withdrawing their eyes from us. Their cheeks were adorned  with vermilion, their ears with pendants of shell, and their necks with  beads. Never yet having signalized themselves as hunters, or performed  the honorable exploit of killing a man, they were held in slight  esteem, and were diffident and bashful in proportion. Certain formidable  inconveniences attended this influx of visitors. They were bent on  inspecting everything in the room; our equipments and our dress alike  underwent their scrutiny; for though the contrary has been carelessly  asserted, few beings have more curiosity than Indians in regard to  subjects within their ordinary range of thought. As to other matters,  indeed, they seemed utterly indifferent. They will not trouble  themselves to inquire into what they cannot comprehend, but are quite  contented to place their hands over their mouths in token of wonder, and  exclaim that it is \"great medicine.\" With this comprehensive solution,  an Indian never is at a loss. He never launches forth into speculation  and conjecture; his reason moves in its beaten track. His soul is  dormant; and no exertions of the missionaries, Jesuit or Puritan, of the  Old World or of the New, have as yet availed to rouse it.    As we were looking, at sunset, from the wall, upon the wild and desolate  plains that surround the fort, we observed a cluster of strange objects  like scaffolds rising in the distance against the red western sky. They  bore aloft some singular looking burdens; and at their foot glimmered  something white like bones. This was the place of sepulture of some  Dakota chiefs, whose remains their people are fond of placing in the  vicinity of the fort, in the hope that they may thus be protected from  violation at the hands of their enemies. Yet it has happened more than  once, and quite recently, that war parties of the Crow Indians, ranging  through the country, have thrown the bodies from the scaffolds, and  broken them to pieces amid the yells of the Dakotas, who remained pent  up in the fort, too few to defend the honored relics from insult. The  white objects upon the ground were buffalo skulls, arranged in the  mystic circle commonly seen at Indian places of sepulture upon the  prairie.    We soon discovered, in the twilight, a band of fifty or sixty  horses approaching the fort. These were the animals belonging to the  establishment; who having been"]]]
