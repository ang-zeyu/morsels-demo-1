'Waterford is another beast,' said Gethryn thoughtfully. 'I suppose  he's not leaving by any chance?'    'Not that I know of. But he'll be nothing without Monk and Danvers.  He's simply a sort of bottle-washer to the firm. When they go he'll  collapse. Let's be strolling towards the House now, shall we? Hullo!  Our only Reece! Hullo, Reece!'    'Hullo!' said the new arrival. Reece was a weird, silent individual,  whom everybody in the School knew up to a certain point, but very few  beyond that point. His manner was exactly the same when talking to the  smallest fag as when addressing the Headmaster. He rather gave one the  impression that he was thinking of something a fortnight ahead, or  trying to solve a chess problem without the aid of the board. In  appearance he was on the short side, and thin. He was in the Sixth, and  a conscientious worker. Indeed, he was only saved from being considered  a swot, to use the vernacular, by the fact that from childhood's  earliest hour he had been in the habit of keeping wicket like an angel.  To a good wicket-keeper much may be forgiven.    He handed Gethryn an envelope.    'Letter, Bishop,' he said. Gethryn was commonly known as the Bishop,  owing to a certain sermon preached in the College chapel some five  years before, in aid of the Church Missionary Society, in which the  preacher had alluded at frequent intervals to another Gethryn, a  bishop, who, it appeared, had a see, and did much excellent work among  the heathen at the back of beyond. Gethryn's friends and acquaintances,  who had been alternating between 'Ginger'--Gethryn's hair being  inclined to redness--and 'Sneg', a name which utterly baffles the  philologist, had welcomed the new name warmly, and it had stuck ever  since. And, after all, there are considerably worse names by which one  might be called.    'What the dickens!' he said, as he finished reading the letter.    'Tell us the worst,' said Marriott. 'You must read it out now out of  common decency, after rousing our expectations like that.'    'All right! It isn't private. It's from an aunt of mine.'    'Seems to be a perfect glut of aunts,' said Marriott. 'What views has  your representative got to air? Is _she_ springing any jolly  little fellow full of spirits on this happy community?'    'No, it's not that. It's only an uncle of mine who's coming down here.  He's coming tomorrow, and I'm to meet him. The uncanny part of it is  that I've never heard of him before in my life.'    'That reminds me of a story I heard--' began Reece slowly. Reece's  observations were not frequent, but when they came, did so for the most  part in anecdotal shape. Somebody was constantly doing something which  reminded him of something he had heard somewhere from somebody. The  unfortunate part of it was that he exuded these reminiscences at such a  leisurely rate of speed that he was rarely known to succeed in  finishing any of them. He resembled those serial stories which appear  in papers destined at a moderate price to fill an obvious void, and  which break off abruptly at the third chapter, owing to the premature  decease of the said periodicals. On this occasion Marriott cut in with  a few sage remarks on the subject of uncles as a class. 'Uncles,' he  said, 'are tricky. You never know where you've got 'em. You think  they're going to come out strong with a sovereign, and they make it a  shilling without a blush. An uncle of mine once gave me a threepenny  bit. If it hadn't been that I didn't wish to hurt his feelings, I  should have flung it at his feet. Also I particularly wanted threepence  at the moment. Is your uncle likely to do his duty, Bishop?'    'I tell you I don't know the man. Never heard of him. I thought I knew  every uncle on the list, but I can't place this one. However, I suppose  I shall have to meet him.'    'Rather,' said Marriott, as they went into the House; 'we should always  strive to be kind, even to the very humblest. On the off chance, you  know. The unknown may have struck it rich in sheep or something out in  Australia. Most uncles come from Australia. Or he may be the boss of  some trust, and wallowing in dollars. He may be anything. Let's go and  brew, Bishop. Come on, Reece.'    'I don't mind watching you two chaps eat,' said Gethryn, 'but I can't  join in myself. I have assimilated three pounds odd of the  Headmagisterial muffins already this afternoon. Don't mind me, though.'    They went upstairs to Marriott's study, which was also Gethryn's. Two  in a study was the rule at Beckford, though there were recluses who  lived alone, and seemed to enjoy it.    When the festive board had ceased to groan, and the cake, which  Marriott's mother had expected to last a fortnight, had been reduced to  a mere wreck of its former self, the thought of his aunt's friend's  friend's son returned to Marriott, and he went down to investigate,  returning shortly afterwards unaccompanied, but evidently full of news.    'Well?' said Gethryn. 'Hasn't he come?'    'A little,' said Marriott, 'just a little. I went down to the fags'  room, and when I opened the door I noticed a certain weird stillness in  the atmosphere. There is usually a row going on that you could cut with  a knife. I looked about. The room was apparently empty. Then I observed  a quaint object on the horizon. Do you know one Skinner by any chance?'    'My dear chap!' said Gethryn. Skinner was a sort of juvenile Professor  Moriarty, a Napoleon of crime. He reeked of crime. He revelled in his  wicked deeds. If a Dormitory-prefect was kept awake at night by some  diabolically ingenious contrivance for combining the minimum of risk  with the maximum of noise, then it was Skinner who had engineered the  thing. Again, did a master, playing nervously forward on a bad pitch at  the nets to Gosling, the School fast bowler, receive the ball gaspingly  in the small ribs, and look round to see whose was that raucous laugh  which had greeted the performance, he would observe a couple of yards  away Skinner, deep in conversation with some friend of equally  villainous aspect. In short, in a word, the only adequate word, he was  Skinner.    'Well?' said Reece.    'Skinner,' proceeded Marriott, 'was seated in a chair, bleeding freely  into a rather dirty pocket-handkerchief. His usual genial smile was  hampered by a cut lip, and his right eye was blacked in the most  graceful and pleasing manner. I made tender inquiries, but could get  nothing from him except grunts. So I departed, and just outside the  door I met young Lee, and got the facts out of him. It appears that P.  V. Wilson, my aunt's friend's friend's son, entered the fags' room at  four-fifteen. At four-fifteen-and-a-half, punctually, Skinner was  observed to be trying to rag him. Apparently the great Percy has no  sense of humour, for at four-seventeen he got tired of it, and hit  Skinner crisply in the right eyeball, blacking the same as per  illustration. The subsequent fight raged gorily for five minutes odd,  and then Wilson, who seems to be a professional pugilist in disguise,  landed what my informant describes as three corkers on his opponent's  proboscis. Skinner's reply was to sit down heavily on the floor, and  give him to understand that the fight was over, and that for the next  day or two his face would be closed for alterations and repairs. Wilson  thereupon harangued the company in well-chosen terms, tried to get  Skinner to shake hands, but failed, and finally took the entire crew  out to the shop, where they made pigs of themselves at his expense. I  have spoken.'    'And that's the kid you've got to look after,' said Reece, after a  pause.    'Yes,' said Marriott. 'What I maintain is that I require a kid built on  those lines to look after me. But you ought to go down and see  Skinner's eye sometime. It's a beautiful bit of work.'          [2]    INTRODUCES AN UNUSUAL UNCLE      On the following day, at nine o'clock, the term formally began. There  is nothing of Black Monday about the first day of term at a public  school. Black Monday is essentially a private school institution.    At Beckford the first day of every term was a half holiday. During the  morning a feeble pretence of work was kept up, but after lunch the  school was free, to do as it pleased and to go where it liked. The nets  were put up for the first time, and the School professional emerged at  last from his winter retirement with his, 'Coom _right_ out to  'em, sir, right forward', which had helped so many Beckford cricketers  to do their duty by the School in the field. There was one net for the  elect, the remnants of last year's Eleven and the 'probables' for this  season, and half a dozen more for lesser lights.    At the first net Norris was batting to the bowling of Gosling, a long,  thin day boy, Gethryn, and the professional--as useful a trio as any  school batsman could wish for. Norris was captain of the team this  year, a sound, stylish bat, with a stroke after the manner of Tyldesley  between cover and mid-off, which used to make Miles the professional  almost weep with joy. But today he had evidently not quite got into  form. Twice in successive balls Gosling knocked his leg stump out of  the ground with yorkers, and the ball after that, Gethryn upset his  middle with a beauty.    'Hat-trick, Norris,' shouted Gosling.    'Can't see 'em a bit today. Bowled, Bishop.'    A second teaser from Gethryn had almost got through his defence. The  Bishop was undoubtedly a fine bowler. Without being quite so fast as  Gosling, he nevertheless contrived to work up a very considerable speed  when he wished to, and there was always something in every ball he  bowled which made it necessary for the batsman to watch it all the way.  In matches against other schools it was generally Gosling who took the  wickets. The batsmen were bothered by his pace."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#2)"],[1,"they may be employed  or not, according to the judgment of the teacher.

Physiological study in youth is of inestimable value. Precious lives are  frequently lost through ignorance. Thousands squander in early years the  strength which should have been kept for the work of real life. Habits are  often formed in youth which entail weakness and poverty upon manhood, and  are a cause of lifelong regret. The use of a strained limb may permanently  damage it. Some silly feat of strength may produce an irreparable injury.  A thoughtless hour of reading by twilight may impair the sight for life. A  terrible accident may happen, and a dear friend perish before our eyes,  while we stand by powerless to render the assistance we could so easily  give did we \"only know what to do.\" The thousand little hints which may  save or lengthen life, may repel or abate disease, and the simple laws  which regulate our bodily vigor, should be so familiar that we may be  quick to apply them in an emergency. The preservation of health is easier  than the cure of disease. Childhood can not afford to wait for the lesson  of experience which is learned only when the penalty of violated law has  been already incurred, and health irrevocably lost.    NATURE'S LAWS INVIOLABLE.--In infancy, we learn how terribly Nature  punishes a violation of certain laws, and how promptly she applies the  penalty. We soon find out the peril of fire, falls, edged tools, and the  like. We fail, however, to notice the equally sharp and certain  punishments which bad habits entail. We are quick to feel the need of  food, but not so ready to perceive the danger of an excess. A lack of air  drives us at once to secure a supply; foul air is as fatal, but it gives  us no warning.    Nature provides a little training for us at the outset of life, but leaves  the most for us to learn by bitter experience. So in youth we throw away  our strength as if it were a burden of which we desire to be rid. We eat  anything, and at any time; do anything we please, and sit up any number of  nights with little or no sleep. Because we feel only a momentary  discomfort from these physical sins, we fondly imagine when that is gone  we are all right again. Our drafts upon our constitution are promptly  paid, and we expect this will always be the case; but some day they will  come back to us, protested; Nature will refuse to meet our demands, and we  shall find ourselves physical bankrupts.    We are furnished in the beginning with a certain vital force upon which we  may draw. We can be spendthrifts and waste it in youth, or be wise and so  husband it till manhood. Our shortcomings are all charged against this  stock. Nature's memory never fails; she keeps her account with perfect  exactness. Every physical sin subtracts from the sum and strength of our  years. We may cure a disease, but it never leaves us as it found us. We  may heal a wound, but the scar still shows. We reap as we sow, and we may  either gather in the thorns, one by one, to torment and destroy, or we may  rejoice in the happy harvest of a hale old age.          I.

THE SKELETON.    I. FORM, STRUCTURE, ETC., OF THE BONES.    (_See page 269_.)    THE SKELETON, or framework of the \"House we live in,\" is composed of about  200 bones. [Footnote: The precise number varies in different periods of  life. Several which are separated in youth become united in old age. Thus  five of the \"false vertebræ\" at the base of the spine early join in one  great bone--the sacrum; while four tiny ones below it often run into a  bony mass--the coccyx (Fig. 6); in the child, the sternum is composed of  eight pieces, while in the adult it consists of only three. While,  however, the number of the bones is uncertain, their relative length is so  exact that the length of the entire skeleton, and thence the height of the  man, can be obtained by measuring a single one of the principal bones.  Fossil bones and those found at Pompeii have the same proportion as our  own.]    USES AND FORMS OF THE BONES.--They have three principal uses: 1. To  protect the delicate organs; [Footnote: An organ is a portion of the body  designed for a particular use, called its _function_. Thus the heart  circulates the blood; the liver produces the bile.] 2. To serve as levers  on which the muscles may act to produce motion; and 3. To preserve the  shape of the body.    Bones differ in form according to the uses they subserve. For convenience  in walking, some are long; for strength and compactness, some are short  and thick; for covering a cavity, some are flat; and for special purposes,  some are irregular. The general form is such as to combine strength and  lightness. For example, all the long bones of the limbs are round and  hollow, thus giving with the same weight a greater strength, [Footnote:  Cut a sheet of foolscap in two pieces. Roll one half into a compact  cylinder, and fold the other into a close, flat strip; support the ends of  each and hang weights in the middle until they bend. The superior strength  of the roll will astonish one unfamiliar with this mechanical principle.  In a rod, the particles break in succession, first those on the outside,  and later those in the center. In a tube, the particles are all arranged  where they resist the first strain. Iron pillars are therefore cast  hollow. Stalks of grass and grain are so light as to bend before a breath  of wind, yet are stiff enough to sustain their load of seed. Bone has been  found by experiment to possess twice the resisting property of solid oak.]  and also a larger surface for the attachment of the muscles.    The Composition of the Bones at maturity is about one part animal to two  parts mineral matter. The proportion varies with the age. In youth it is  nearly"]]]
