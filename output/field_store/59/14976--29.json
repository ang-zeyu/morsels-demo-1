The exploration of Northern Australia, which formed the object of my  first journey in 1831, has, consistently with the views I have always  entertained on the subject [* See London Geographical Journal, vol. vii.  part 2, p. 282.], been found equally essential in 1846 to the full  development of the geographical resources of New South Wales. The same  direction indicated on Mr. Arrowsmith's map, published by the Royal  Geographical Society in 1837, was, in 1846, considered, by a committee of  the Legislative Council of New South Wales, the most desirable to pursue  at a time when every plan likely to relieve the colony from distress  found favour with the public.    At no great distance lay India and China, and still nearer, the rich  islands of the Indian Archipelago; all well-peopled countries, while the  industrious and enterprising colonists of the South were unable to avail  themselves of the exuberance of the soil and its productions,    \"Which mock'd their scant manurings, and requir'd MORE HANDS THAN THEIRS  to prune their wanton growth.\"    The same attraction which drew the greatest of discoverers westward, \"al  nacimiento de la especeria [* To the region where spices grew.],\" seemed  to invite the Australian explorer northward; impelled by the wayward  fortunes of the Anglo-Saxon race already rooted at the southern extremity  of the land whose name had previously been \"Terra Australis incognita.\"  The character of the interior of that country still remained unknown, the  largest portion of earth as yet unexplored. For the mere exploration, the  colonists of New South Wales might not have been very anxious just at  that time, but when the object of acquiring geographical knowledge could  be combined with that of exploring a route towards the nearest part of  the Indian Ocean, westward of a dangerous strait, it was easy to awaken  the attention of the Australian public to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#2)"],[1," as  she? That does not sound respectful in a child of your age, and I wish  my little girl always to be respectful to those older than herself.  I thought I heard you the other day mention some gentleman's name  without the prefix of Mr., and I intended to reprove you for it at the  time. Don't do it again.\"    \"No, sir, I won't,\" Elsie answered with a blush. \"But, papa,\" she  added the next moment, \"Miss Stevens does that constantly.\"    \"That makes no difference, my daughter,\" he said gravely. \"Miss  Stevens is the very last person I would have you take for your model;  the less you resemble her in dress, manners, or anything else, the  better. If you wish to copy any one let it be Miss Allison, for she is  a perfect lady in every respect.\"    Elsie looked very much pleased. \"Yes, indeed, papa,\" she said, \"I  should be glad if I could be just like Miss Rose, she is always kind  and gentle to everybody; even the servants, whom Miss Stevens orders  about so crossly.\"    \"Elsie!\"    \"What, papa?\" she asked, blushing again, for his tone was reproving.    \"Come here and sit on my knee; I want to talk to you. I am afraid my  little daughter is growing censorious,\" he said, with a very grave  look as he drew her to his side. \"You forget that we ought not to  speak of other people's faults.\"    \"I will try not to do it any more, papa,\" she replied, the tears  springing to her eyes; \"but you don't know how very annoying Miss  Stevens is. I have been near telling her several times that I did wish  she would let me alone.\"    \"No, daughter, don't do that. You must behave in a lady-like manner  whether she does or not. We must expect annoyances in this world, my  child; and must try to bear them with patience, remembering that  God sends the little trials as well as the great, and that He has  commanded us to 'let patience have her perfect work.' I fear it is a  lack of the spirit of forgiveness that makes it so difficult for us to  bear these trifling vexations with equanimity. And you must remember  too, dear, that the Bible bids us be courteous, and teaches us to  treat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated.\"    \"I think you always remember the command to be courteous, papa,\" she  said, looking affectionately into his face. \"I was wondering all the  time how you could be so very polite to Miss Stevens; for I was quite  sure you would rather not have had her along. And then, what right had  she to take your arm without being asked?\" and Elsie's face flushed  with indignation.    Her father laughed a little. \"And thus deprive my little girl of her  rights,\" he said, softly kissing the glowing cheek. \"Ah! I doubt if  you would have been angry had it been Miss Rose,\" he added, a little  mischievously.    \"Oh, papa, you know Miss Rose would never have done such a thing!\"  exclaimed the little girl warmly.    \"Ah! well, dear,\" he said in a soothing tone; \"we won't talk any more  about it. I acknowledge that I do not find Miss Stevens the most  agreeable company in the world, but I must treat her politely, and  show her a little attention sometimes; both because she is a lady and  because her father once saved my father's life; for which I owe a debt  of gratitude to him and his children.\"    \"Did he, papa? I am sure it was very good of him, and I will try to  like Miss Stevens for that. But won't you tell me about it?\"    \"It was when they were both quite young men,\" said Mr. Dinsmore,  \"before either of them was married: they were skating together and  your grandfather broke through the ice, and would have been drowned,  but for the courage and presence of mind of Mr. Stevens, who saved him  only by very great exertion, and at the risk of his own life.\"    A few days after this, Elsie was playing on the veranda, with several  other little girls. \"Do you think you shall like your new mamma,  Elsie?\" asked one of them in a careless tone, as she tied on an apron  she had just been making for her doll, and turned it around to see how  it fitted.    \"My new mamma!\" exclaimed Elsie, with unfeigned astonishment, dropping  the scissors with which she had been cutting paper dolls for some of  the little ones. \"What can you mean, Annie? I am not going to have any  new mamma.\"    \"Yes, indeed, but you are though,\" asserted Annie positively; \"for I  heard my mother say so only yesterday; and it must be so, for she Miss  Stevens told it herself.\"    \"Miss Stevens! and what does she know about it? what has she to do  with my papa's affairs?\" asked Elsie indignantly, the color rushing  over face, neck, and arms.    \"Well, I should think she might know, when she is going to marry him,\"  returned the other, with a laugh.    \"She isn't! it's false! my\"--but Elsie checked herself and shut her  teeth hard to keep down the emotion that was swelling in her breast.    \"It's true, you may depend upon it,\" replied Annie; \"everybody in the  house knows it, and they are all talking about what a splendid match  Miss Stevens is going to make; and mamma was wondering if you knew  it, and how you would like her; and papa said he thought Mr. Dinsmore  wouldn't think much of her if he knew how she flirted and danced until  he came, and now pretends not to approve of balls, just because he  doesn't.\"    Elsie made no reply, but dropping scissors, paper, and everything,  sprang up and ran swiftly along the veranda, through the hall,  upstairs, and without pausing to take breath, rushed into her father's  room, where he sat quietly reading.    \"Why, Elsie, daughter, what is the matter?\" he asked in a tone of  surprise and concern, as he caught sight of her flushed and agitated  face.    \"Oh, papa, it's that hateful Miss Stevens; I can't bear her!\" she  cried, throwing herself upon his breast, and bursting into a fit of  passionate weeping.    Mr. Dinsmore said nothing for a moment; but thinking tears would prove  the best relief to her overwrought feelings, contented himself with  simply stroking her hair in a soothing way, and once or twice pressing  his lips gently to her forehead.    \"You feel better now, dearest, do you not?\" he asked presently, as she  raised her head to wipe away her tears.    \"Yes, papa.\"    \"Now tell me what it was all about.\"    \"Miss Stevens does say such hateful things, papa!\"    He laid his finger upon her lips. \"Don't use that word again. It does  not sound at all like my usually gentle sweet-tempered little girl.\"    \"I won't, papa,\" she murmured, blushing and hanging her head. Then  hiding her face on his breast, she lay there for several minutes  perfectly silent and still.    \"What is my little girl thinking of?\" he asked at length.    \"How everybody talks about you, papa; last evening I was out on the  veranda, and I heard John and Miss Stevens' maid, Phillis, talking  together. It was moonlight, you know, papa,\" she went on, turning her  face toward him again: \"and they were out under the trees and John had  his arm round her, and he was kissing her, and telling her how pretty  she was; and then they began talking about Miss Stevens and you, and  John told Phillis that he reckoned you were going to marry her--\"    \"Who? Phillis?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore, looking excessively amused.    \"Oh, papa; no; you know I mean Miss Stevens,\" Elsie answered in a tone  of annoyance.    \"Well, dear, and what of it all?\" he asked, soothingly. \"I don't think  the silly nonsense of the servants need trouble you. John is a sad  fellow, I know; he courts all the pretty colored girls wherever he  goes. I shall have to read him a serious lecture on the subject. But  it is very kind of you to be so concerned for Phillis.\"    \"Oh, papa, don't!\" she said, turning away her face. \"Please don't  tease me so. You know I don't care for Phillis or John; but that isn't  all.\" And then she repeated what had passed between Annie and herself.    He looked a good deal provoked as she went on with her story; then  very grave indeed. He was quite silent for a moment after she had  done. Then drawing her closer to him, he said tenderly, \"My poor  little girl, I am sorry you should be so annoyed; but you know it is  not true, daughter, and why need you care what other people think and  say?\"    \"I don't like them to talk so, papa! I can't bear to have them say  such things about you!\" she exclaimed indignantly.    He was silent again for a little; then said kindly, \"I think I had  better take you away from these troublesome talkers. What do you say  to going home?\"    \"Oh, yes, papa, do take me home,\" she answered eagerly. \"I wish we  were there now. I think it is the pleasantest place in the world and  it seems such a long, long while since we came away. Let us start  to-morrow, papa; can't we?\"    \"But you know you will have to leave Miss Rose.\"    \"Ah! I forgot that,\" she said a little sadly; but brightening again,  she asked: \"Couldn't you invite her to go home with us and spend the  winter? Ah! papa, do! it would be so pleasant to have her.\"    \"No, my dear, it wouldn't do,\" he replied with a grave shake of the  head.    \"Why, papa?\" she asked with a look of keen disappointment.    \"You are too young to understand why,\" he said in the same grave tone,  and then relapsed into silence; sitting there for some time stroking  her hair in an absent way, with his eyes on the carpet.    At last he said, \"Elsie!\" in a soft, low tone that quite made the  little girl start and look up into his face; for she, too, had been in  a deep reverie.    \"What, papa?\" she asked, and she wondered to see how the color had  spread over his face, and how bright his eyes looked.    \"I have been thinking,\" he said, in a half hesitating way, \"that  though it would not do to invite Miss Rose to spend the winter with  us, it might do very nicely to ask her to come and live at the Oaks.\"    Elsie looked at him for a moment with a bewildered expression; then  suddenly comprehending, her face lighted up.    \"Would you like it, dearest?\" he asked; \"or would you prefer to go on"]]]
