[Illustration: FIG. 2.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.]    The total weight of the bridge is, as we have said, 44,000 pounds, which  is much less than would have been that of a revolving bridge of the same  span. The maneuvering of the bridge is performed with the greatest ease  and requires about two minutes.    This system has been in operation at the market station of La Vilette  since the year 1868, and has required but insignificant repairs. We  think the adoption of it might be recommended for all cases in which a  slight difference between the level of a railroad and that of a water  course would not permit of the establishment of a revolving bridge.--_Le  Genie Civil_.           *       *       *       *       *          ST. PETERSBURG A SEAPORT.      The Emperor and Empress of Russia, on Wednesday, May 27. 1885, the  second anniversary of their coronation at Moscow, opened the Maritime  Canal, in the Bay of Cronstadt, the shallow upper extremity of the Gulf  of Finland, by which great work the city of St. Petersburg is made a  seaport as much as London. St. Petersburg, indeed, stands almost on the  sea shore, at the very mouth of the Neva, though behind several low  islands which crowd the head of the Gulf; and though this is an inland  sea without saltness or tides, it is closed by ice in winter. Seventeen  miles to the west is the island of Cronstadt, a great fortress, with  naval dockyards and arsenals for the imperial fleet, and with a spacious  harbor for ships of commerce. The navigable entrance channel up the  Bay of Cronstadt to the mouth of the Neva lies under the south side of  Cronstadt, and is commanded by its batteries. As the bay eastward has a  depth not exceeding 12 ft., and the depth of the Neva at its bar is but  9 ft., all large vessels have been obliged hitherto to discharge their  cargoes at Cronstadt, to be there transferred to lighters and barges  which brought the goods up to the capital. \"The delay and expense of  this process,\" says Mr. William Simpson, our special artist, \"will be  understood by stating that a cargo might be brought from England by a  steamer in a week, but it would take three weeks at least to transport  the same cargo from Cronstadt to St. Petersburg. Of course, much of this  time was lost by custom house formalities. Sometimes it has taken even  longer than is here stated, which made the delivery of goods at St.  Petersburg a matter of great uncertainty, thus rendering time contracts  almost an impossibility. This state of things had continued from the  time of Peter the Great, and his great scheme had never been fully  realized. The increase of commerce and shipping had long made this a  crying evil; but even with all these difficulties, the trade here has  been rapidly growing. A scheme to bring the shipping direct to the  capital had thus become almost a necessity. As Manchester wishes to  bring the ocean traffic to her doors without the intervention of  Liverpool, so St. Petersburg desired to have its steamers sailing up to  the city, delivering and loading their cargoes direct at the stores and  warehouses in her streets. If Glasgow had not improved the Clyde, and  had up to the present day to bring up all goods carried by her ocean  going steamers from Port Glasgow--a place constructed for that purpose  last century, and which is twenty miles from Glasgow--she would have  been handicapped exactly as St. Petersburg has been till now in the  commercial race.    \"For some years the subject was discussed at St. Petersburg, and  more than one scheme was proposed; at last the project of General N.  Pooteeloff was adopted. According to this plan, a canal has been cut  through the shallow bottom of the Gulf of Finland, all the way from  Cronstadt to St. Petersburg. The line of this canal is from northwest to  southeast; it may be said to run very nearly parallel to the coast line  on the south side of the Gulf, and about three miles distant from it.  This line brings the canal to the southwest end of St. Petersburg, where  there are a number of islands, which have formed themselves, in the  course of ages, where the Bolshaya, or Great Neva, flows into the Gulf.  It is on these islands that the new port is to be formed. It is a very  large harbor, and capable of almost any amount of extension. It will be  in connection with the whole railway system of Russia. One part of the  scheme is that of a new canal, on the south side of the city, to connect  the maritime canal, as well as the new harbor, with the Neva, so that  the large barges may pass, by a short route, to the river on the east,  and thus avoid the bridges and traffic of the city.    \"The whole length of the canal is about eighteen miles. The longer  portion of it is an open channel, which is made 350 feet wide at bottom.  Its course will be marked by large iron floating buoys; these it is  proposed to light with gas by a new self-acting process which has been  very successful in other parts of the world; by this means the canal  will be navigable by night as well as by day. The original plan was to  have made the canal 20 feet deep, but this has been increased to 22  feet. The Gulf of Finland gradually deepens toward Cronstadt, so that  the dredging was less at the western end. This part was all done by  dredgers, and the earth brought up was removed to a safe distance by  means of steam hopper barges. The contract for this part of the work  was sublet to an American firm--Morris and Cummings, of New York. The  eastern portion of the work on the canal is by far the most important,  and about six miles of it is protected by large and strong embankments  on each side. These embankments were formed by the output of the  dredgers, and are all faced with granite bowlders brought from Finland;  at their outer termination the work is of a more durable kind, the  facing is made of squared blocks of granite, so that it may stand the  heavy surf which at times is raised by a west wind in the Gulf. These  embankments, as already stated, extend over a space of nearly six miles,  and represent a mass of work to which there is no counterpart in the  Suez Canal; nor does the plan of the new Manchester Canal present  anything equivalent to it. The width of this canal also far exceeds any  of those notable undertakings. The open channel is, as stated above, 350  ft. wide; within the embankments the full depth of 22 ft. extends to 280  ft., and the surface between the embankments is 700 ft. This is nearly  twice the size of the Suez Canal at the surface, which is 100 meters,  or about 320 ft., while it is only about 75 ft. at the bottom; the  Amsterdam Canal is 78 ft. wide. The new Manchester Canal is to be 100  ft. of full depth, and it boasts of this superiority over the great work  of Lesseps. The figures given above will show how far short it comes of  the dimensions of the St. Petersburg Canal. The Manchester Canal is to  be 24 ft. in depth; in that it has the advantage of 2 ft. more than the  St. Petersburg Canal; but with the ample width this one possesses, this,  or even a greater depth, can be given if it should be found necessary.  Most probably this will have ultimately to be done, for ocean going  steamers are rapidly increasing in size since the St. Petersburg Canal  was planned, and in a very few years the larger class of steamers might  have to deliver their cargoes at Cronstadt, as before, if the waterway  to St. Petersburg be not adapted to their growing dimensions.    [Illustration: THE ST. PETERSBURG AND CRONSTADT MARITIME CANAL, OPENED  BY THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA, ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 1885.]    \"The dredging between the embankments of the canal was done by an  improved process, which may interest those connected with such works. It  may be remembered that the Suez Canal was mostly made by dredging, and  that the dredgers had attached to them what the French called 'long  couloirs' or spouts, into which water was pumped, and by this means the  stuff brought up by the dredgers was carried to the sides of the canal,  and there deposited. The great width of the St. Petersburg Canal was too  much for the long couloirs, hence some other plan had to be found. The  plan adopted was that invented by Mr. James Burt, and which had been  used with the greatest success on the New Amsterdam Canal. Instead of  the couloir, floating pipes, made of wood, are in this system employed;  the earth or mud brought up has a copious stream of water poured on it,  which mixes in the process of descending, and the whole becomes a thick  liquid. This, by means of a centrifugal pump, is propelled through the  floating pipes to any point required, where it can be deposited. The  couloir can only run the output a comparatively short distance, while  this system can send it a quarter of a mile, or even further, if  necessary. Its power is not limited to the level surface of the water.  I saw on my visit to the canal one of the dredgers at work, and the  floating pipes lay on the water like a veritable sea-serpent, extending  to a long distance where the stuff had to be carried. At that point the  pipe emerged from the water, and what looked very much like a vertebra  or two of the serpent crossed the embankment, went down the other side,  and there the muddy deposit was pouring out in a steady flow. Mr. Burt  pointed out to me one part of the works where his pump had sent the  stuff nearly half a mile away, and over undulating ground. This system  will not suit all soils. Hard clay, for instance, will not mix with the  water; but where the matter brought up is soft and easily diluted, this  plan possesses many advantages, and its success here affords ample  evidence of its merits.    \"About five miles below St. Petersburg, a basin had been already"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#2)"],[1," at their vertices a  very sharp and formidable angle.  Indeed when their bases are of the  most degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size),  they can hardly be distinguished from Straight lines or Women; so  extremely pointed are their vertices.  With us, as with you, these  Triangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and  by this name I shall refer to them in the following pages.    Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.    Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself  belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.    Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,  beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in  the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of  Polygonal, or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes  so numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot  be distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or  Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.    It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more  side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule)  one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a  Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.    But this rule applies not always to the Tradesman, and still less often  to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to  deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides  equal.  With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the  son of an Isosceles (i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal) remains  Isosceles still.  Nevertheless, all hope is not such out, even from the  Isosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded  condition.  For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent  and skillful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent  among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of  their third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.  Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters  of these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally  result in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the  Equal-Sided Triangle.    Rarely--in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births--is a  genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced from Isosceles  parents (footnote 1).  Such a birth requires, as its antecedents, not  only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages, but also a  long-continued exercise of frugality and self-control on the part of  the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral, and a patient,  systematic, and continuous development of the Isosceles intellect  through many generations.    The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the  subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round.  After a  strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the  infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted  into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately taken from his  proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral,  who is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his  former home or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear  lest the freshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious  imitation, fall back again into his hereditary level.    The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his  serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor serfs themselves,  as a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their  existence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher  classes are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little  or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges, serve as almost useful  barrier against revolution from below.    Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely  destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in  some of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their  superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the  Circles.  But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that in proportion  as the working-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all  virtue, in that same proportion their acute angle (which makes them  physically terrible) shall increase also and approximate to their  comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the  most brutal and formidable off the soldier class--creatures almost on a  level with women in their lack of intelligence--it is found that, as  they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous  penetrating power to advantage, so do they wane in the power of  penetration itself.    How admirable is the Law of Compensation!  And how perfect a proof of  the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the  aristocratic constitution of the States of Flatland!  By a judicious  use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always  able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the  irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.  Art also  comes to the aid of Law and Order.  It is generally found possible--by  a little artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State  physicians--to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion  perfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into the privileged  classes; a much larger number, who are still below the standard,  allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled, are induced to  enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept in honourable  confinement for life; one or two alone of the most obstinate, foolish,  and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.    Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless, are  either transfixed without resistance by the small body of their  brethren whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this  kind; or else more often, by means of jealousies and suspicious  skillfully fomented among them by the Circular party, they are stirred  to mutual warfare, and perish by one another's angles.  No less than  one hundred and twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides  minor outbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty-five; and they have  all ended thus.        Footnote 1.  \"What need of a certificate?\" a Spaceland critic may ask:  \"Is not the procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature  herself, proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?\" I reply that no  Lady of any position will mary an uncertified Triangle.  Square  offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle;  but in almost every such case the Irregularity of the first generation  is visited on the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal  rank, or relapses to the Triangular.          SECTION 4  Concerning the Women      If our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable, it  may be readily inferred that far more formidable are our Women.  For,  if a Soldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak, ALL  point, at least at the two extremities.  Add to this the power of  making herself practically invisible at will, and you will perceive  that a Female, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled  with.    But here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask HOW a woman in  Flatland can make herself invisible.  This ought, I think, to be  apparent without any explanation.  However, a few words will make it  clear to the most unreflecting.    Place a needle on the table.  Then, with your eye on the level of the  table, look at it side-ways, and you see the whole length of it; but  look at it end-ways, and you see nothing but a point, it has become  practically invisible.  Just so is it with one of our Women.  When her  side is turned towards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end  containing her eye or mouth--for with us these two organs are  identical--is the part that meets our eye, then we see nothing but a  highly lustrous point; but when the back is presented to our view,  then--being only sub-lustrous, and, indeed, almost as dim as an  inanimate object--her hinder extremity serves her as a kind of  Invisible Cap.    The dangers to which we are exposed from our Women must now be manifest  to the meanest capacity of Spaceland.  If even the angle of a  respectable Triangle in the middle class is not without its dangers; if  to run against a Working Man involves a gash; if collision with an  Officer of the military class necessitates a serious wound; if a mere  touch from the vertex of a Private Soldier brings with it danger of  death;--what can it be to run against a woman, except absolute and  immediate destruction?  And when a Woman is invisible, or visible only  as a dim sub-lustrous point, how difficult must it be, even for the  most cautious, always to avoid collision!    Many are the enactments made at different times in the different States  of Flatland, in order to minimize this peril; and in the Southern and  less temperate climates, where the force of gravitation is greater, and  human beings more liable to casual and involuntary motions, the Laws  concerning Women are naturally much more stringent.  But a general view  of the Code may be obtained from the following summary:--    1.  Every house shall have one entrance on the Eastern side, for the  use of Females only; by which all females shall enter \"in a becoming  and respectful manner\" (footnote 1) and not by the Men's or Western  door.    2.  No Female shall walk in any public place without continually  keeping up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.    3.  Any Female, duly certified to be suffering"]]]
