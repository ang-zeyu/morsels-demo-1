In answer came this note, like so many, if not most of his, indeed,  without date:--       THE COTTAGE, CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR.     (_No date_.)       \"MY DEAR SIR,--I am here as yet a fixture, and beg you to come our     way.  Would Tuesday or Wednesday suit you by any chance?  We shall     then, I believe, be empty: a thing favourable to talks.  You get here     in time for dinner.  I stay till near the end of September, unless, as     may very well be, the weather drive me forth.--Yours very sincerely,     ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"    I accordingly went to Braemar, where he and his wife and her son were  staying with his father and mother.    These were red-letter days in my calendar alike on account of pleasant  intercourse with his honoured father and himself.  Here is my pen-and-ink  portrait of R. L. Stevenson, thrown down at the time:    Mr Stevenson's is, indeed, a very picturesque and striking figure.  Not  so tall probably as he seems at first sight from his extreme thinness,  but the pose and air could not be otherwise described than as  distinguished.  Head of fine type, carried well on the shoulders and in  walking with the impression of being a little thrown back; long brown  hair, falling from under a broadish-brimmed Spanish form of soft felt  hat, Rembrandtesque; loose kind of Inverness cape when walking, and  invariable velvet jacket inside the house.  You would say at first sight,  wherever you saw him, that he was a man of intellect, artistic and  individual, wholly out of the common.  His face is sensitive, full of  expression, though it could not be called strictly beautiful.  It is  longish, especially seen in profile, and features a little irregular; the  brow at once high and broad.  A hint of vagary, and just a hint in the  expression, is qualified by the eyes, which are set rather far apart from  each other as seems, and with a most wistful, and at the same time  possibly a merry impish expression arising over that, yet frank and  clear, piercing, but at the same time steady, and fall on you with a  gentle radiance and animation as he speaks.  Romance, if with an  indescribable _soupcon_ of whimsicality, is marked upon him; sometimes he  has the look as of the Ancient Mariner, and could fix you with his  glittering e'e, and he would, as he points his sentences with a movement  of his thin white forefinger, when this is not monopolised with the  almost incessant cigarette.  There is a faint suggestion of a  hair-brained sentimental trace on his countenance, but controlled, after  all, by good Scotch sense and shrewdness.  In conversation he is very  animated, and likes to ask questions.  A favourite and characteristic  attitude with him was to put his foot on a chair or stool and rest his  elbow on his knee, with his chin on his hand; or to sit, or rather to  half sit, half lean, on the corner of a table or desk, one of his legs  swinging freely, and when anything that tickled him was said he would  laugh in the heartiest manner, even at the risk of bringing on his cough,  which at that time was troublesome.  Often when he got animated he rose  and walked about as he spoke, as if movement aided thought and  expression.  Though he loved Edinburgh, which was full of associations  for him, he had no good word for its east winds, which to him were as  death.  Yet he passed one winter as a \"Silverado squatter,\" the story of  which he has inimitably told in the volume titled _The Silverado  Squatters_; and he afterwards spent several winters at Davos Platz,  where, as he said to me, he not only breathed good air, but learned to  know with closest intimacy John Addington Symonds, who \"though his books  were good, was far finer and more interesting than any of his books.\"  He  needed a good deal of nursery attentions, but his invalidism was never  obtrusively brought before one in any sympathy-seeking way by himself; on  the contrary, a very manly, self-sustaining spirit was evident; and the  amount of work which he managed to turn out even when at his worst was  truly surprising.    His wife, an American lady, is highly cultured, and is herself an author.  In her speech there is just the slightest suggestion of the American  accent, which only made it the more pleasing to my ear.  She is heart and  soul devoted to her husband, proud of his achievements, and her delight  is the consciousness of substantially aiding him in his enterprises.    They then had with them a boy of eleven or twelve, Samuel Lloyd Osbourne,  to be much referred to later (a son of Mrs Stevenson by a former  marriage), whose delight was to draw the oddest, but perhaps half  intentional or unintentional caricatures, funny, in some cases, beyond  expression.  His room was designated the picture-gallery, and on entering  I could scarce refrain from bursting into laughter, even at the general  effect, and, noticing this, and that I was putting some restraint on  myself out of respect for the host's feelings, Stevenson said to me with  a sly wink and a gentle dig in the ribs, \"It's laugh and be thankful  here.\"  On Lloyd's account simple engraving materials, types, and a small  printing-press had been procured; and it was Stevenson's delight to make  funny poems, stories, and morals for the engravings executed, and all  would be duly printed together.  Stevenson's thorough enjoyment of the  picture-gallery, and his goodness to Lloyd, becoming himself a very boy  for the nonce, were delightful to witness and in degree to share.  Wherever they were--at Braemar, in Edinburgh, at Davos Platz, or even at  Silverado--the engraving and printing went on.  The mention of the  picture-gallery suggests that it was out of his interest in the colour-  drawing and the picture-gallery that his first published story, _Treasure  Island_, grew, as we shall see.    I have some copies of the rude printing-press productions, inexpressibly  quaint, grotesque, a kind of literary horse-play, yet with a certain  squint-eyed, sprawling genius in it, and innocent childish Rabelaisian  mirth of a sort.  At all events I cannot look at the slight memorials of  that time, which I still possess, without laughing afresh till my eyes  are dewy.  Stevenson, as I understood, began _Treasure Island_ more to  entertain Lloyd Osbourne than anything else; the chapters being regularly  read to the family circle as they were written, and with scarcely a  purpose beyond.  The lad became Stevenson's trusted companion and  collaborator--clearly with a touch of genius.    I have before me as I write some of these funny momentoes of that time,  carefully kept, often looked at.  One of them is, \"_The Black Canyon_;  _or_, _Wild Adventures in the Far West_: a Tale of Instruction and  Amusement for the Young, by Samuel L. Osbourne, printed by the author;  Davos Platz,\" with the most remarkable cuts.  It would not do some of the  sensationalists anything but good to read it even at this day, since many  points in their art are absurdly caricatured.  Another is \"_Moral  Emblems_; _a Collection of Cuts and Verses_, by R. L. Stevenson, author  of the _Blue Scalper_, etc., etc.  Printers, S. L. Osbourne and Company,  Davos Platz.\"  Here are the lines to a rare piece of grotesque, titled _A  Peak in Darien_--       \"Broad-gazing on untrodden lands,     See where adventurous Cortez stands,     While in the heavens above his head,     The eagle seeks its daily bread.     How aptly fact to fact replies,     Heroes and eagles, hills and skies.     Ye, who contemn the fatted slave,     Look on this emblem and be brave.\"    Another, _The Elephant_, has these lines--       \"See in the print how, moved by whim,     Trumpeting Jumbo, great and grim,     Adjusts his trunk, like a cravat,     To noose that individual's hat;     The Sacred Ibis in the distance,     Joys to observe his bold resistance.\"    R. L. Stevenson wrote from Davos Platz, in sending me _The Black Canyon_:       \"Sam sends as a present a work of his own.  I hope you feel flattered,     for _this is simply the first time he has ever given one away_.  I     have to buy my own works, I can tell you.\"    Later he said, in sending a second:       \"I own I have delayed this letter till I could forward the enclosed.     Remembering the night at Braemar, when we visited the picture-gallery,     I hope it may amuse you: you see we do some publishing hereaway.\"    Delightfully suggestive and highly enjoyable, too, were the meetings in  the little drawing-room after dinner, when the contrasted traits of  father and son came into full play--when R. L. Stevenson would sometimes  draw out a new view by bold, half-paradoxical assertion, or compel  advance on the point from a new quarter by a searching question couched  in the simplest language, or reveal his own latest conviction finally, by  a few sentences as nicely rounded off as though they had been written,  while he rose and gently moved about, as his habit was, in the course of  those more extended remarks.  Then a chapter or two of _The Sea-Cook_  would be read, with due pronouncement on the main points by one or other  of the family audience.    The reading of the book is one thing.  It was quite another thing to hear  Stevenson as he stood reading it aloud, with his hand stretched out  holding the manuscript, and his body gently swaying as a kind of  rhythmical commentary on the story.  His fine voice, clear and keen it  some of its tones, had a wonderful power of inflection and variation, and  when he came to stand in the place of Silver you could almost have  imagined you saw the great one-legged John Silver, joyous-eyed, on the  rolling sea.  Yes, to read it in print was good, but better yet to hear  Stevenson read it.          CHAPTER II--_TREASURE ISLAND_ AND SOME REMINISCENCES      When I left Braemar, I carried with me a considerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#2)"],[1,"that the Second, published in 1620, is not the work of  Shelton, but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that  it has less spirit, less of what we generally understand by \"go,\" about  it than the first, which would be only natural if the first were the work  of a young man writing currente calamo, and the second that of a  middle-aged man writing for a bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer  and more literal, the style is the same, the very same translations, or  mistranslations, occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new  translator would, by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry  off the credit.    In 1687 John Phillips, Milton's nephew, produced a \"Don Quixote\" \"made  English,\" he says, \"according to the humour of our modern language.\" His  \"Quixote\" is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a travesty that  for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in  the literature of that day.    Ned Ward's \"Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily  translated into Hudibrastic Verse\" (1700), can scarcely be reckoned a  translation, but it serves to show the light in which \"Don Quixote\" was  regarded at the time.    A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by  Peter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with  literature. It is described as \"translated from the original by several  hands,\" but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the  manipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on the other  hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it carefully with  the original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from Shelton  and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked out by borrowings from  Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It is, to be sure, more  decent and decorous, but it treats \"Don Quixote\" in the same fashion as a  comic book that cannot be made too comic.    To attempt to improve the humour of \"Don Quixote\" by an infusion of  cockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux's operators did, is not  merely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an  absolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of  the uncritical way in which \"Don Quixote\" is generally read that this  worse than worthless translation--worthless as failing to represent,  worse than worthless as misrepresenting--should have been favoured as it  has been.    It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken and  executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the portrait  painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas has been  allowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said none, for it is  known to the world in general as Jarvis's. It was not published until  after his death, and the printers gave the name according to the current  pronunciation of the day. It has been the most freely used and the most  freely abused of all the translations. It has seen far more editions than  any other, it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful,  and yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author.  Jervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface, where  among many true words about Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and  unjustly charges Shelton with having translated not from the Spanish, but  from the Italian version of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten  years after Shelton's first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too,  seems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and  a mediocre one (though he has given us the best portrait we have of  Swift), and this may have been strengthened by Pope's remark that he  \"translated 'Don Quixote' without understanding Spanish.\" He has been  also charged with borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true  that in a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and  gone astray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty  where he is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope's dictum, anyone who  examines Jervas's version carefully, side by side with the original, will  see that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one than  Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in fact, an  honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has left a version  which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free from errors  and mistranslations.    The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry--\"wooden\" in a word,-and  no one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be pleaded  for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence of  the light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He was one of the  few, very few, translators that have shown any apprehension of the  unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic humour; it seemed to  him a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his own  good things, and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic  abstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the  characteristic of his translation. In most modern editions, it should be  observed, his style has been smoothed and smartened, but without any  reference to the original Spanish, so that if he has been made to read  more agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity.    Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of  these. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas's  translation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no  heed given to the original Spanish.    The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,  which appeared in 1769, \"printed for the Translator,\" was an impudent  imposture, being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the  words, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was  only an abridgment like Florian's, but not so skilfully executed; and the  version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her brother's  plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former  translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be in every  sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not  even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since  then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the  temptation which Mr. Duffield's reputation and comely volumes hold out to  every lover of Cervantes.    From the foregoing history of our translations of \"Don Quixote,\" it will  be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere  narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures  served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether  that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On  the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not  merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least  as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a  preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have  acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.    But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there  is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why  a translator who makes it his aim to treat \"Don Quixote\" with the respect  due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless  reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a  question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with  him who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the  Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the  great majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers  to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much  a part of the translator's duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can  please all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those  who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is  in his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is  practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it.    My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to  indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my  ability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,  cannot be too rigidly followed in translating \"Don Quixote,\" is to avoid  everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in  one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than  Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or  obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and  one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably  undergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in  Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of \"Don  Quixote\" differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of  the present day. Except in the tales and Don Quixote's speeches, the  translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will  almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original.    Seeing that the story of \"Don Quixote\" and all its characters and  incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar  as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old  familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of  course a translator who holds that \"Don Quixote\" should receive the  treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the  injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything.    II: ABOUT CERVANTES "]]]
