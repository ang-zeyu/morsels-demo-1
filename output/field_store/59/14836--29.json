They  drank water from springs. In the spring, food was plentiful. There  were eggs of different colors in nests and many hare to eat. The  goddess Easter was celebrated at this time.    After this hunting and gathering era, there was farming and  domestication of animals such as horses, pigs, sheep, goats,  chicken, and cattle. Of these, the pig was the most important meat  supply, being killed and salted for winter use. Next in importance  were the cattle. Sheep were kept primarily for their wool. Flocks  and herds were taken to pastures. The male cattle, with wood  yokes, pulled ploughs in the fields of barley and wheat. The  female goat and cow provided milk, butter, and cheese. The  chickens provided eggs. The hoe, spade, and grinding stone were  used. Thread was spun with a hand-held spindle which one hand held  while the other hand alternately formed the thread from a mass and  then wound it around the spindle. A coarse cloth was woven and  worn as a tunic which had been cut from the cloth. Kings wore  tunics decorated with sheet gold.  Decorated pottery was made from  clay and used to hold liquids and for food preparation and  consumption. During the period of \"lent\" [from the word \"lencten\",  which means spring], it was forbidden to eat any meat or fish.  This was the season in which many animals were born and grew to  maturity. Wood carts with four wheels were used to transport  produce and manure. Horses were used for transportation of people  or goods. Wood dug-out boats and paddles were used to fish on  rivers or on the seacoast.    Clans had settlements near rivers. Each settlement had a meadow,  for the mowing of hay, and a simple mill, with round timber huts,  covered with branches or thatch or turf supported by a ring of  posts. Inside was a hearth with smoke going up through a hole in  the roof, and a cauldron for cooking food. There was an upright  loom in the darkness. The floor was swept clean. At the door were  spears or bags of slingstones ready for immediate use. The King  lived in the largest hut. Gullies outside carried off excess  water. Each hut had a garden for fruit and vegetables. A goat or  cow might be tied out of reach of the garden. There was a fence or  hedge surrounding and protecting the garden area and dwelling.  Buckets and cauldrons which had originated from the Mediterranean  were used. Querns with the top circular stone turned by hand over  the bottom stone were used for grinding grain. There were ovens to  dry and roast grain. Grain was first eaten as a porridge or  cereal. There were square wood graneries on stilts and wood racks  on which to dry hay. Grain was stored in concealed pits in the  earth which were lined with drystone or basketwork or clay and  made airtight by sealing with clay or dung. Old pits were  converted into waste dumps, burials, or latrines. Outside the  fence were an acre or two of fields of wheat and barley, and  sometimes oats and rye. Wheat and rye were sown in the fall, and  oats and barley in the spring. Sowing was by men or two oxen  drawing a simple scratch plow. The crops were all harvested in the  summer. In this two-field system, land was held by peasants in  units designed to support a single extended family. These fields  were usually enclosed with a hedge to keep animals from eating the  crop and to define the territory of the settlement from that of  its neighbors. Flax was grown and made into linen cloth. Beyond  the fields were pastures for cattle and sheep grazing. There was  often an area for beehives. This was subsistence level farming.    Pottery was given symmetry when formed with use of a wheel and  heated in increasingly hot kilns. From kilns used for pottery, it  was noticed that lumps of gold or copper ore within would melt and  assume the shape of what they had been resting on. These were the  first metals, and could be beaten into various shapes, such as  ornaments. Then the liquid ore was poured into moulds carved out  of stones to make axes and daggers, which were reheated and  hammered to become strong. Copper-tipped drills, chisels, punches  and awls were also made.    The bodies of deceased were buried far away from any village in  wood coffins, except for kings, who were placed in large stone  coffins after being wrapped in linen. Buried with them were a few  personal items, such as copper daggers, flat copper axes, and awls  [small pointed tool for piercing holes in leather, wood, or other  soft materials.]. The deceased was buried in a coffin with a stone  on top deep in the earth to keep the spirit of the dead from  coming out to haunt the living.    It was learned that tin added to the copper made a stronger metal:  bronze. Stone hammers, and bronze and iron tools, were used to  make cooking pots, weapons, breast plates, and horse bits, which  were formed from moulds and/or forged by bronze smiths and  blacksmiths from iron extracted from iron ore heated in bowl-  shaped hearths. Typically one man operated the bellows to keep the  fire hot while another did the hammering. Bronze was made into  sickles for harvesting, razors for shaving, tweezers, straight  hair pins, safety pins for clothes, armlets, neck-rings, and  mirrors. Weapons included bows and arrows, flint and copper  daggers, bronze swords and spears, stone axes, and shields of wood  with bronze mountings. The bows and arrows probably evolved from  spear throwing rods. Kings in body armor fought with chariots  drawn by two horses. The horse harnesses had bronze fittings. The  chariots had wood wheels, later with iron rims. When bronze came  into use, there was a demand for its constituent parts: copper and  tin, which were traded by rafts on waterways and the sea. When  iron came into use, there were wrought iron axes, saws, adzes [ax  with curved blade used to dress wood], files, ploughshares,  harrows [set of spikes to break clods of earth on plowed land and  also to cover seed when sewn], scythes, billhooks [thick knife  with hooked point used to prune shrubs], and spits for hearths.  Lead was mined. There was some glassmaking of beads. Wrought iron  bars were used as currency.    Hillforts now had wooden palisades on top of their banks to  protect the enclosed farmsteads and villages from stock wandering  off or being taken by rustlers, and from attacks by wild animals  or other people. Later a rampart was added from which sentries  could patrol. These were supported by timber and/or stone  structures. Timbers were probably transported by carts or dragged  by oxen. At the entrances were several openings only one of which  really allowed entry. The others went between banks into dead ends  and served as traps in which to kill the enemy from above. Gates  were of wood, some hung from hinges on posts which could be  locked. Later guard chambers were added, some with space for  hearths and beds. Sometimes further concentric circles of banks  and ditches, and perhaps a second rampart, were added around these  forts. They could reach to 14 acres. The ramparts are sufficiently  widely spaced to make sling-shotting out from them highly  effective, but to minimize the dangers from sling-shotting from  without. The additional banks and ditches could be used to create  cattle corridors or to protect against spear-thrown firebrands.  However, few forts had springs of water within them, indicating  that attacks on them were probably expected to be short. Attacks  usually began with warriors bristling with weapons and blowing war  trumpets shouting insults to the foe, while their kings dashed  about in chariots. Sometimes champions from each side fought in  single combat. The Celts took the heads of those they killed to  hang from their belts or place on wood spikes at the gates.  Prisoners, including women and children, might become slaves.  Kings sometimes lived in separate palisades where they kept their  horses and chariots.    Circles of big stones like Stonehenge were rebuilt so that the  sun's position with respect to the stones would indicate the day  of longest sunlight and the day of shortest sunlight. Between  these days there was an optimum time to harvest the crops before  fall, when plants dried up and leaves fell from the trees. The  winter solstice, when the days began to get longer was cause for  celebration. In the next season, there was an optimum time to  plant seeds so they could spring up from the ground as new growth.  So farming gave rise to the concept of a year. Certain changes of  the year were celebrated, such as Easter, named for the Goddess of  the Dawn, which occurred in the east (after lent); May Day  celebrating the revival of life; Lammas around July, when the  wheat crop was ready for harvesting; and on October 31 the Celtic  eve of Samhain, when the spirits of the dead came back to visit  homes and demand food or else cast an evil spell on the refusing  homes; and at which masked and costumed inhabitants representing  the souls of the dead paraded to the outskirts of the settlements  to lead the ghosts away from their homes; and at which animals and  humans, who might be deemed to be possessed by spirits, were  sacrificed or killed perhaps as examples, in huge bonfires  [bonefires] as those assembled looked out for spirits and evil  beings.    There was an agricultural revolution from the two-field to the  three-field system, in which there were three large fields for the  heavy and fertile land. Each field was divided into long and  narrow strips. Each strip represented a day's work with the  plough. One field had wheat, or perhaps rye, another had barley,  oats, beans, or peas, and the third was fallow. These were rotated  yearly. There was a newly invented plough that was heavy and made  of wood and later had an attached iron blade. The plough had a  mould-board which caught the soil stirred by the plough"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6615"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Our Own Land — Complete (#2)"],[1,"an, of goodly girth, his round head topped with a  steeple hat, the skirts of his belted coat and flaps of his petticoat  trousers meeting at the tops of heavy boots, and the face--ugh!--green  and ghastly, with unmoving eyes that glimmered in the twilight like  phosphorus. The dwarf carried a keg, and on receiving an intimation, in a  sign, that he would like Rip to relieve him of it, that cheerful vagabond  shouldered it and marched on up the mountain.    At nightfall they emerged on a little plateau where a score of men in the  garb of long ago, with faces like that of Rip's guide, and equally still  and speechless, were playing bowls with great solemnity, the balls  sometimes rolling over the plateau's edge and rumbling down the rocks  with a boom like thunder. A cloaked and snowy-bearded figure, watching  aloof, turned like the others, and gazed uncomfortably at the visitor who  now came blundering in among them. Rip was at first for making off, but  the sinister glare in the circle of eyes took the run out of his legs,  and he was not displeased when they signed to him to tap the keg and join  in a draught of the ripest schnapps that ever he had tasted,--and he knew  the flavor of every brand in Catskill. While these strange men grew no  more genial with passing of the flagons, Rip was pervaded by a satisfying  glow; then, overcome by sleepiness and resting his head on a stone, he  stretched his tired legs out and fell to dreaming.    Morning. Sunlight and leaf shadow were dappled over the earth when he  awoke, and rising stiffly from his bed, with compunctions in his bones,  he reached for his gun. The already venerable implement was so far gone  with rot and rust that it fell to pieces in his hand, and looking down at  the fragments of it, he saw that his clothes were dropping from his body  in rags and mould, while a white beard flowed over his breast. Puzzled  and alarmed, shaking his head ruefully as he recalled the carouse of the  silent, he hobbled down the mountain as fast as he might for the grip of  the rheumatism on his knees and elbows, and entered his native village.  What! Was this Catskill? Was this the place that he left yesterday? Had  all these houses sprung up overnight, and these streets been pushed  across the meadows in a day? The people, too: where were his friends? The  children who had romped with him, the rotund topers whom he had left  cooling their hot noses in pewter pots at the tavern door, the dogs that  used to bark a welcome, recognizing in him a kindred spirit of vagrancy:  where were they?    And his wife, whose athletic arm and agile tongue had half disposed him  to linger in the mountains how happened it that she was not awaiting him  at the gate? But gate there was none in the familiar place: an unfenced  yard of weeds and ruined foundation wall were there. Rip's home was gone.  The idlers jeered at his bent, lean form, his snarl of beard and hair,  his disreputable dress, his look of grieved astonishment. He stopped,  instinctively, at the tavern, for he knew that place in spite of its new  sign: an officer in blue regimentals and a cocked hat replacing the  crimson George III. of his recollection, and labelled \"General  Washington.\" There was a quick gathering of ne'er-do-weels, of  tavern-haunters and gaping 'prentices, about him, and though their faces  were strange and their manners rude, he made bold to ask if they knew  such and such of his friends.    \"Nick Vedder? He's dead and gone these eighteen years.\" \"Brom Dutcher? He  joined the army and was killed at Stony Point.\" \"Van Brummel? He, too,  went to the war, and is in Congress now.\"    \"And Rip Van Winkle?\"    \"Yes, he's here. That's him yonder.\"    And to Rip's utter confusion he saw before him a counterpart of himself,  as young, lazy, ragged, and easy-natured as he remembered himself to be,  yesterday--or, was it yesterday?    \"That's young Rip,\" continued his informer. \"His father was Rip Van  Winkle, too, but he went to the mountains twenty years ago and never came  back. He probably fell over a cliff, or was carried off by Indians, or  eaten by bears.\"    Twenty years ago! Truly, it was so. Rip had slept for twenty years  without awaking. He had left a peaceful colonial village; he returned to  a bustling republican town. How he eventually found, among the oldest  inhabitants, some who admitted that they knew him; how he found a  comfortable home with his married daughter and the son who took after him  so kindly; how he recovered from the effect of the tidings that his wife  had died of apoplexy, in a quarrel; how he resumed his seat at the tavern  tap and smoked long pipes and told long yarns for the rest of his days,  were matters of record up to the beginning of this century.    And a strange story Rip had to tell, for he had served as cup-bearer to  the dead crew of the Half Moon. He had quaffed a cup of Hollands with no  other than Henry Hudson himself. Some say that Hudson's spirit has made  its home amid these hills, that it may look into the lovely valley that  he discovered; but others hold that every twenty years he and his men  assemble for a revel in the mountains that so charmed them when first  seen swelling against the western heavens, and the liquor they drink on  this night has the bane of throwing any mortal who lips it into a slumber  whence nothing can arouse him until the day dawns when the crew shall  meet again. As you climb the east front of the mountains by the old  carriage road, you pass, half-way up the height, the stone that Rip Van  Winkle slept on, and may see that it is slightly hollowed by his form.  The ghostly revellers are due in the Catskills in 1909, and let all  tourists who are among the mountains in September of that year beware of  accepting liquor from strangers.          CATSKILL GNOMES    Behind the New Grand Hotel, in the Catskills, is an amphitheatre of  mountain that is held to be the place of which the Mohicans spoke when  they told of people there who worked in metals, and had bushy beards and  eyes like pigs. From the smoke of their forges, in autumn, came the haze  of Indian summer; and when the moon was full, it was their custom to  assemble on the edge of a precipice above the hollow and dance and caper  until the night was nigh worn away. They brewed a liquor that had the  effect of shortening the bodies and swelling the heads of all who drank  it, and when Hudson and his crew visited the mountains, the pygmies held  a carouse in his honor and invited him to drink their liquor. The crew  went away, shrunken and distorted by the magic distillation, and thus it  was that Rip Van Winkle found them on the eve of his famous sleep.          THE CATSKILL WITCH    When the Dutch gave the name of Katzbergs to the mountains west of the  Hudson, by reason of the wild-cats and panthers that ranged there, they  obliterated the beautiful Indian Ontiora, \"mountains of the sky.\" In one  tradition of the red men these hills were bones of a monster that fed on  human beings until the Great Spirit turned it into stone as it was  floundering toward the ocean to bathe. The two lakes near the summit were  its eyes. These peaks were the home of an Indian witch, who adjusted the  weather for the Hudson Valley with the certainty of a signal service  bureau. It was she who let out the day and night in blessed alternation,  holding back the one when the other was at large, for fear of conflict.  Old moons she cut into stars as soon as she had hung new ones in the sky,  and she was often seen perched on Round Top and North Mountain, spinning  clouds and flinging them to the winds. Woe betide the valley residents if  they showed irreverence, for then the clouds were black and heavy, and  through them she poured floods of rain and launched the lightnings,  causing disastrous freshets in the streams and blasting the wigwams of  the mockers. In a frolic humor she would take the form of a bear or deer  and lead the Indian hunters anything but a merry dance, exposing them to  tire and peril, and vanishing or assuming some terrible shape when they  had overtaken her. Sometimes she would lead them to the cloves and would  leap into the air with a mocking \"Ho, ho!\" just as they stopped with a  shudder at the brink of an abyss. Garden Rock was a spot where she was  often found, and at its foot a lake once spread. This was held in such  awe that an Indian would never wittingly pursue his quarry there; but  once a hunter lost his way and emerged from the forest at the edge of the  pond. Seeing a number of gourds in crotches of the trees he took one, but  fearing the spirit he turned to leave so quickly that he stumbled and it  fell. As it broke, a spring welled from it in such volume that the  unhappy man was gulfed in its waters, swept to the edge of Kaaterskill  clove and dashed on the rocks two hundred and sixty feet below. Nor did  the water ever cease to run, and in these times the stream born of the  witch's revenge is known as Catskill Creek.          THE REVENGE OF SHANDAKEN    On the rock platform where the Catskill Mountain House now stands,  commanding one of the fairest views in the world, old chief Shandaken set  his wigwam,--for it is a mistake to suppose that barbarians are  indifferent to beauty,--and there his daughter, Lotowana, was sought in  marriage by his braves. She, however, kept faith to an early vow  exchanged with a young chief of the Mohawks. A suitor who was  particularly troublesome was Norsereddin, proud, morose, dark-featured, a  stranger to the red man, a descendant, so he claimed, from Egyptian  kings, and who lived by himself on Kaaterskill Creek, appearing among  white settlements but rarely.    On one of his visits to Catskill, a tavern-lounging Dutchman wagered him  a thousand golden crowns that he could not win Lotowana, and, stung by  avarice as well as inflamed by passion, Norsereddin laid new siege to her  heart. Still the girl refused to"]]]
