[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#2)"],[1," house  were--almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes--bolted and locked  against it.    An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom  I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our  family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called  her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable  personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married  to a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the  sense of the homely adage, 'handsome is, that handsome does'--for he  was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having  once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined  arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These  evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him  off, and effect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with  his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was  once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think  it must have been a Baboo--or a Begum. Anyhow, from India tidings of his  death reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt, nobody  knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name  again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off,  established herself there as a single woman with one servant, and  was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible  retirement.    My father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was  mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was 'a  wax doll'. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not  yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double  my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He  died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came  into the world.    This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be  excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no  claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to  have any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what  follows.    My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in  spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about  herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by  some grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer upstairs, to a world not at  all excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting  by the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and  very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her,  when, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she  saw a strange lady coming up the garden.    My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was  Miss Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the  garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity  of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to  nobody else.    When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.  My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any  ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and  looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against  the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became  perfectly flat and white in a moment.    She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am  indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.    My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in  the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly,  began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head  in a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown  and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to  come and open the door. My mother went.    'Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,' said Miss Betsey; the emphasis  referring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.    'Yes,' said my mother, faintly.    'Miss Trotwood,' said the visitor. 'You have heard of her, I dare say?'    My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable  consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering  pleasure.    'Now you see her,' said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged  her to walk in.    They went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best  room on the other side of the passage not being lighted--not having  been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both  seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to  restrain herself, began to cry. 'Oh tut, tut, tut!' said Miss Betsey, in  a hurry. 'Don't do that! Come, come!'    My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had  had her cry out.    'Take off your cap, child,' said Miss Betsey, 'and let me see you.'    My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd  request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as she  was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was  luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.    'Why, bless my heart!' exclaimed Miss Betsey. 'You are a very Baby!'    My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her  years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said,  sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and  would be but a childish mother if she lived. In a short pause which  ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and  that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she  found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands  folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire.    'In the name of Heaven,' said Miss Betsey, suddenly, 'why Rookery?'    'Do you mean the house, ma'am?' asked my mother.    'Why Rookery?' said Miss Betsey. 'Cookery would have been more to the  purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.'    'The name was Mr. Copperfield's choice,' returned my mother. 'When he  bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.'    The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old  elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss  Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one another,  like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such  repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if  their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,  some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks'-nests, burdening their higher  branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.    'Where are the birds?' asked Miss Betsey.    'The--?' My mother had been thinking of something else.    'The rooks--what has become of them?' asked Miss Betsey.    'There have not been any since we have lived here,' said my mother. 'We  thought--Mr. Copperfield thought--it was quite a large rookery; but  the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long  while.'    'David Copperfield all over!' cried Miss Betsey. 'David Copperfield from  head to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there's not a rook near it,  and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!'    'Mr. Copperfield,' returned my mother, 'is dead, and if you dare to  speak unkindly of him to me--'    My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of  committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have  settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better  training for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed  with the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very  meekly, and fainted.    When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,  whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The  twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they  saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the  fire.    'Well?' said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only  been taking a casual look at the prospect; 'and when do you expect--'    'I am all in a tremble,' faltered my mother. 'I don't know what's the  matter. I shall die, I am sure!'    'No, no, no,' said Miss Betsey. 'Have some tea.'    'Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?' cried my  mother in a helpless manner.    'Of course it will,' said Miss Betsey. 'It's nothing but fancy. What do  you call your girl?'    'I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am,' said my mother  innocently.    'Bless the Baby!' exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the  second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but  applying it to my mother instead of me, 'I don't mean that. I mean your  servant-girl.'    'Peggotty,' said my mother.    'Peggotty!' repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. 'Do you mean to  say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,  and got herself named Peggotty?' 'It's her surname,' said my mother,  faintly. 'Mr. Copperfield called her by it, because her Christian name  was the same as mine.'    'Here! Peggotty!' cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlour door. 'Tea.  Your mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle.'    Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been  a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house,  and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the  passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#2)"],[1,"ble.\"'    But the others did not seem to think so, and it was Alice's turn to say.    She said, 'I think we might try the divining-rod. I'm sure I could do  it. I've often read about it. You hold a stick in your hands, and when  you come to where there is gold underneath the stick kicks about. So you  know. And you dig.'    'Oh,' said Dora suddenly, 'I have an idea. But I'll say last. I hope the  divining-rod isn't wrong. I believe it's wrong in the Bible.'    'So is eating pork and ducks,' said Dicky. 'You can't go by that.'    'Anyhow, we'll try the other ways first,' said Dora. 'Now, H. O.'    'Let's be Bandits,' said H. O. 'I dare say it's wrong but it would be  fun pretending.'    'I'm sure it's wrong,' said Dora.    And Dicky said she thought everything wrong. She said she didn't, and  Dicky was very disagreeable. So Oswald had to make peace, and he said--    'Dora needn't play if she doesn't want to. Nobody asked her. And, Dicky,  don't be an idiot: do dry up and let's hear what Noel's idea is.'    Dora and Dicky did not look pleased, but I kicked Noel under the table  to make him hurry up, and then he said he didn't think he wanted to  play any more. That's the worst of it. The others are so jolly ready to  quarrel. I told Noel to be a man and not a snivelling pig, and at last  he said he had not made up his mind whether he would print his poetry in  a book and sell it, or find a princess and marry her.    'Whichever it is,' he added, 'none of you shall want for anything,  though Oswald did kick me, and say I was a snivelling pig.'    'I didn't,' said Oswald, 'I told you not to be.' And Alice explained to  him that that was quite the opposite of what he thought. So he agreed to  drop it.    Then Dicky spoke.    'You must all of you have noticed the advertisements in the papers,  telling you that ladies and gentlemen can easily earn two pounds a  week in their spare time, and to send two shillings for sample and  instructions, carefully packed free from observation. Now that we don't  go to school all our time is spare time. So I should think we could  easily earn twenty pounds a week each. That would do us very well. We'll  try some of the other things first, and directly we have any money we'll  send for the sample and instructions. And I have another idea, but I  must think about it before I say.'    We all said, 'Out with it--what's the other idea?'    But Dicky said, 'No.' That is Dicky all over. He never will show you  anything he's making till it's quite finished, and the same with his  inmost thoughts. But he is pleased if you seem to want to know, so  Oswald said--    'Keep your silly old secret, then. Now, Dora, drive ahead. We've all  said except you.'    Then Dora jumped up and dropped the stocking and the thimble (it rolled  away, and we did not find it for days), and said--    'Let's try my way _now_. Besides, I'm the eldest, so it's only fair.  Let's dig for treasure. Not any tiresome divining-rod--but just plain  digging. People who dig for treasure always find it. And then we shall  be rich and we needn't try your ways at all. Some of them are rather  difficult: and I'm certain some of them are wrong--and we must always  remember that wrong things--'    But we told her to shut up and come on, and she did.    I couldn't help wondering as we went down to the garden, why Father  had never thought of digging there for treasure instead of going to his  beastly office every day.        CHAPTER 2. DIGGING FOR TREASURE    I am afraid the last chapter was rather dull. It is always dull in books  when people talk and talk, and don't do anything, but I was obliged to  put it in, or else you wouldn't have understood all the rest. The best  part of books is when things are happening. That is the best part of  real things too. This is why I shall not tell you in this story about  all the days when nothing happened. You will not catch me saying, 'thus  the sad days passed slowly by'--or 'the years rolled on their weary  course'--or 'time went on'--because it is silly; of course time goes  on--whether you say so or not. So I shall just tell you the nice,  interesting parts--and in between you will understand that we had our  meals and got up and went to bed, and dull things like that. It would be  sickening to write all that down, though of course it happens. I said  so to Albert-next-door's uncle, who writes books, and he said, 'Quite  right, that's what we call selection, a necessity of true art.' And he  is very clever indeed. So you see.    I have often thought that if the people who write books for children  knew a little more it would be better. I shall not tell you anything  about us except what I should like to know about if I was reading the  story and you were writing it. Albert's uncle says I ought to have put  this in the preface, but I never read prefaces, and it is not much good  writing things just for people to skip. I wonder other authors have  never thought of this.    Well, when we had agreed to dig for treasure we all went down into the  cellar and lighted the gas. Oswald would have liked to dig there, but  it is stone flags. We looked among the old boxes and broken chairs and  fenders and empty bottles and things, and at last we found the spades we  had to dig in the sand with when we went to the seaside three years ago.  They are not silly, babyish, wooden spades, that split if you look at  them, but good iron, with a blue mark across the top of the iron part,  and yellow wooden handles. We wasted a little time getting them dusted,  because the girls wouldn't dig with spades that had cobwebs on them.  Girls would never do for African explorers or anything like that, they  are too beastly particular.    It was no use doing the thing by halves. We marked out a sort of square  in the mouldy part of the garden, about three yards across, and began  to dig. But we found nothing except worms and stones--and the ground was  very hard.    So we thought we'd try another part of the garden, and we found a  place in the big round flower bed, where the ground was much softer. We  thought we'd make a smaller hole to begin with, and it was much better.  We dug and dug and dug, and it was jolly hard work! We got very hot  digging, but we found nothing.    Presently Albert-next-door looked over the wall. We do not like him very  much, but we let him play with us sometimes, because his father is dead,  and you must not be unkind to orphans, even if their mothers are  alive. Albert is always very tidy. He wears frilly collars and velvet  knickerbockers. I can't think how he can bear to.    So we said, 'Hallo!'    And he said, 'What are you up to?'    'We're digging for treasure,' said Alice; 'an ancient parchment revealed  to us the place of concealment. Come over and help us. When we have  dug deep enough we shall find a great pot of red clay, full of gold and  precious jewels.'    Albert-next-door only sniggered and said, 'What silly nonsense!' He  cannot play properly at all. It is very strange, because he has a very  nice uncle. You see, Albert-next-door doesn't care for reading, and he  has not read nearly so many books as we have, so he is very foolish and  ignorant, but it cannot be helped, and you just have to put up with it  when you want him to do anything. Besides, it is wrong to be angry with  people for not being so clever as you are yourself. It is not always  their faults.    So Oswald said, 'Come and dig! Then you shall share the treasure when  we've found it.'    But he said, 'I shan't--I don't like digging--and I'm just going in to  my tea.'    'Come along and dig, there's a good boy,' Alice said. 'You can use my  spade. It's much the best--'    So he came along and dug, and when once he was over the wall we kept him  at it, and we worked as well, of course, and the hole got deep. Pincher  worked too--he is our dog and he is very good at digging. He digs for  rats in the dustbin sometimes, and gets very dirty. But we love our dog,  even when his face wants washing.    'I expect we shall have to make a tunnel,' Oswald said, 'to reach the  rich treasure.' So he jumped into the hole and began to dig at one side.  After that we took it in turns to dig at the tunnel, and Pincher was  most useful in scraping the earth out of the tunnel--he does it with  his back feet when you say 'Rats!' and he digs with his front ones, and  burrows with his nose as well.    At last the tunnel was nearly a yard long, and big enough to creep  along to find the treasure, if only it had been a bit longer. Now it was  Albert's turn to go in and dig, but he funked it.    'Take your turn like a man,' said Oswald--nobody can say that Oswald  doesn't take his turn like a man. But Albert wouldn't. So we had to make  him, because it was only fair.    'It's quite easy,' Alice said. 'You just crawl in and dig with your  hands. Then when you come out we can scrape out what you've done, with  the spades. Come--be a man. You won't notice it being dark in the tunnel  if you shut your eyes tight. We've all been in except Dora--and she  doesn't like worms.'    'I don't like worms neither.' Albert-next-door said this; but we  remembered how he had picked a fat red and black worm up in his fingers  and thrown it at Dora only the day before. So we put him in.    But he would not go in head first, the proper way, and dig with his  hands as we had done, and though Oswald was angry at the time, for he  hates snivellers, yet afterwards he owned that perhaps it was just  as well. You should never be afraid to own that perhaps you were  mistaken--but it is cowardly to do it unless you are quite sure you are  in the wrong.    'Let me go in feet first,' said Albert-next-door. 'I'll dig with my  boots--I will truly, honour bright.'    So we let him get in feet first--and he did it very slowly and at last  he was in, and only his head sticking out into the hole; and all the  rest of him in the tunnel.    'Now dig with your boots,'"]]]
