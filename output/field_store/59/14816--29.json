Ever  since the first caveman began to hunt wild beasts and slay them  with clubs and stones, the two warring forces have been interested  in each other, but for about 25,000 years I think that the wild  beasts knew about as much of man's intelligence as men knew of  theirs.    I leave to those who are interested in history the task of  revealing the date, or the period, when scholarly men first began  to pay serious attention to the animal mind.    In 1895 when Mr. George J. Romanes, of London, published his  excellent work on \"Animal Intelligence,\" on one of its first pages  he blithely brushed aside as of little account all the  observations, articles and papers on his subject that had been  published previous to that time. Now mark how swiftly history can  repeat itself, and also bring retribution.    In 1910 there arose in the United States of America a group of  professional college-and-university animal psychologists who set  up the study of \"animal behavior.\" They did this so seriously, and  so determinedly, that one of the first acts of two of them  consisted in joyously brushing aside as of no account whatever,  and quite beneath serious consideration, everything that had been  seen, done and said previous to the rise of their group, and the  laboratory Problem Box. In view of what this group has  accomplished since 1910, with their \"problem boxes,\" their \"mazes\"  and their millions of \"trials by error,\" expressed in solid pages  of figures, the world of animal lovers is entitled to smile  tolerantly upon the cheerful assumptions of ten years ago.    But let it not at any time be assumed that we are destitute of  problem boxes; for the author has two of his own! One is called  the Great Outdoors, and the other is named the New York Zoological  Park. The first has been in use sixty years, the latter twenty-two  years. Both are today in good working order, but the former is not  quite as good as new.    A Preachment to the Student. In studying the wild-animal mind,  the boundary line between Reality and Dreamland is mighty easy to  cross. He who easily yields to seductive reasoning, and the call  of the wild imagination, soon will become a dreamer of dreams and  a seer of visions of things that never occurred. The temptation to  place upon the simple acts of animals the most complex and far-  fetched interpretations is a trap ever ready for the feet of the  unwary. It is better to see nothing than to see a lot of things  that are not true.    In the study of animals, we have long insisted that _to the open  eye and the thinking brain, truth is stranger than fiction._  But Truth does not always wear her heart upon her sleeve for  zanies to peck at. Unfortunately there are millions of men who go  through the world looking at animals, but not seeing them.    Beware of setting up for wild animals impossible mental and moral  standards. The student must not deceive himself by overestimating  mental values. If an estimate must be made, make it under the mark  of truth rather than above it. While avoiding the folly of  idealism, we also must shun the ways of the narrow mind, and the  eyes that refuse to see the truth. Wild animals are not superhuman  demigods of wisdom; but neither are they idiots, unable to reason  from cause to effect along the simple lines that vitally affect  their existence.    Brain-owning wild animals are not mere machines of flesh and  blood, set agoing by the accident of birth, and running for life  on the narrow-gauge railway of Heredity. They are not \"Machines in  Fur and Feathers,\" as one naturalist once tried to make the world  believe them to be. Some animals have more intelligence than some  men; and some have far better morals.    What Constitutes Evidence. The best evidence regarding the ways of  wild animals is one's own eye-witness testimony. Not all second-  hand observations are entirely accurate. Many persons do not know  how to observe; and at times some are deceived by their own eyes  or ears. It is a sad fact that both those organs are easily  deceived. The student who is in doubt regarding the composition of  evidence will do well to spend a few days in court listening to  the trial of an important and hotly contested case. In collecting  real evidence, all is not gold that glitters.    Many a mind misinterprets the thing seen, sometimes innocently,  and again wantonly. The nature fakir is always on the alert to see  wonderful phenomena in wild life, about which to write; and by  preference he places the most strained and marvellous  interpretation upon the animal act. Beware of the man who always  sees marvellous things in animals, for he is a dangerous guide.  There is one man who claims to have seen in his few days in the  woods more wonders than all the older American naturalists and  sportsmen have seen added together.    Now, Nature does not assemble all her wonderful phenomena and hold  them in leash to be turned loose precisely when the great Observer  of Wonders spends his day in the woods. Wise men always suspect  the man who sees too many marvelous things.    The Relative Value of Witnesses. It is due that a word should be  said regarding \"expert testimony\" in the case of the wild animal.  Some dust has been raised in this field by men posing as  authorities on wild animal psychology, whose observations of the  world's wild animals have been confined to the chipmunks,  squirrels, weasels, foxes, rabbits, and birds dwelling within a  small circle surrounding some particular woodland house. In  another class other men have devoted heavy scientific labors to  laboratory observations on white rats, domestic rabbits, cats,  dogs, sparrows, turtles and newts as the handpicked exponents of  the intelligence of the animals of the world!    Alas! for the human sense of Proportion!    Fancy an ethnologist studying the Eskimo, the Dog-Rib Indian, the  Bushman, the Aino and the Papuan, and then proceeding to write  conclusively \"On the Intelligence of the Human Race.\"    The proper place in which to study the minds, manners and morals  of wild animals is in the most thickly populated haunts of the  most intelligent species. The free and untrammeled animal, busily  working out its own destiny unhindered by man, is the beau-ideal  animal to observe and to study. Go to the plain, the wilderness,  the desert and the mountain, not merely to shoot everything on  foot, but to SEE _animals at home,_ and there use your eyes  and your field-glass. See what _normal wild animals_ do as  \"behavior,\" and then try to find out why they do it.    The next best place for study purposes is a spacious, sanitary and  well-stocked zoological park, wherein are assembled great  collections of the most interesting land vertebrates that can be  procured, from all over the earth. There the student can observe  many new traits of wild animal character, as they are brought to  the surface by captivity. There will some individuals reveal the  worst traits of their species. Others will reveal marvels in  mentality, and teach lessons such as no man can learn from them in  the open. To study temperament, there is no place like a zoo.    Even there, however, the wisest course,--as it seems to me,--is  not to introduce too many appliances as aids to mental activity,  but rather to see what the animal subject thinks and does _by  its own initiative._ In the testing of memory and the  perceptive faculties, training for performances is the best method  to pursue.    The reader has a right to know that the author of this volume has  enjoyed unparalleled opportunities for the observation and study  of highly intelligent wild animals, both in their wild haunts and  in a great vivarium; and these combined opportunities have covered  a long series of years.    Before proceeding farther, it is desirable to define certain terms  that frequently will be used in these pages.    THE ANIMAL BRAIN is the generator of the mind, and the clearing-  house of the senses. As a mechanism, the brain of man is the most  perfect, and in the descent through the mammals, birds, reptiles,  amphibians and fishes, the brain progressively is simplified in  form and function.    THOUGHT is the result of the various processes of the brain and  nervous system, stimulated by the contributions of the senses.    SANITY is the state of normal, orderly and balanced thought, as  formulated by a healthy brain.    INSANITY is a state of mental disease, resulting in disordered,  unbalanced and chaotic thought, destitute of reason.    REASON is the manifestation of correct observation and healthful  thought which recognizes both cause and effect, and leads from  premise to conclusion. INTELLIGENCE is created by the possession  of knowledge either inherited or acquired. It may be either latent  or active; and it is the forerunner of reason.    INSTINCT is the knowledge or impulse which animals or men derive  from their ancestors by inheritance, and which they obey, either  consciously or subconsciously in working out their own  preservation, increase and betterment. Instinct often functions as  a sixth sense.    EDUCATION is the acquirement of knowledge by precept or by  observation; but animals as well as men may be self-taught, and  become self-educated, by the diligent exercise of the observing  and reasoning faculties. The adjustment of a wild animal mind to  conditions unknown to its ancestors is through the process of  self-education, and by logical reasoning from premise to  conclusion.    The wild animal must think, or die.    Animal intelligence varies in quantity and quality as much as  animals vary in size. Idiots, maniacs and sleeping persons are the  only classes of human beings who are devoid of intelligence and  reasoning power. Idiots and maniacs also are often devoid of the  common animal _instinct_ that ordinarily promotes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60708"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 4 (#2)"],[1,"to be with the Saints.
