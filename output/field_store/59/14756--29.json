[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#2)"],[1,"this noble looking fellow had no  terrors for her. He seemed so woebegone, his great brown eyes pleaded  so earnestly, that she could only pity and fondle him.    \"Look out, Miss; maybe he bites,\" warned the anxious conductor. \"I  wager this is some boy's trick to stop the train. And yet--\"    Ruth bent down, still patting the dog's head, and turned the great  silver plate on his collar so that she could read, in the light of the  lanterns, that which was engraved upon it. She read the words aloud:    \"'This is Reno, Tom Cameron's Dog.'\"    \"Cameron?\" repeated some man behind her. \"That Tom Cameron lives just  outside of Cheslow. His father is the rich dry-goods merchant, Macy  Cameron. What's his dog doing here?\"    \"And with a red light tied to his collar?\" propounded somebody else.    \"It's some boy's trick, I tell you,\" stormed the conductor. \"I'll have  to report this at headquarters.\"    Just then Ruth made a discovery. Wound about the collar was a bit of  twisted cloth--a strip of linen--part of a white handkerchief. Her  nimble fingers unwound it quickly and she spread out the soiled rag.    \"Oh, see here!\" she cried, in amazement as well as fear. \"See! What  can it mean? See what's drawn on this cloth--\"    It was a single word--a word smeared across the rag in shaking,  uneven letters:    \"HELP!\"    \"By George!\" exclaimed one of the brakemen. \"The little girl's right.  That spells 'Help!' plain enough.\"    \"It--it is written in something red, sir,\" cried Ruth, her voice  trembling. \"See! It is blood!\"    \"I tell you we've wasted a lot of time here,\" declared the conductor.  \"I am sorry if anybody is hurt, but we cannot stop for him. Get back  to the cars, please, gentlemen. Do you belong aboard?\" he added, to  Ruth. \"Get aboard, if you do.\"    \"Oh, sir! You will not leave the poor dog here?\" Ruth asked.    \"Not with that red lamp on his collar--no!\" exclaimed the conductor.  \"He will be fooling some other engineer--\"    He reached to disentangle the wire from the dog's collar; but Reno  uttered a low growl.    \"Plague take the dog!\" ejaculated the conductor, stepping back  hastily. \"Whoever it is that's hurt, or wherever he is, we cannot send  him help from here. We'll report the circumstance at the Cheslow  Station. Put the dog in the baggage car. He can find the place where  his master is hurt, from Cheslow as well as from here, it's likely.\"    \"You try to make him follow you, Miss,\" added the conductor to Ruth.  \"He doesn't like me, it's plain.\"    \"Come here, Reno!\" Ruth commanded. \"Come here, old fellow.\"    The big dog hesitated, stepped a yard or two after her, stopped,  looked around and across the track toward the swamp meadow, and  whined.    Ruth went back to him and put both arms about the noble fellow's neck.  \"Come, Reno,\" she said \"Come with me. We will go to find your master  by and by.\"    She started for the cars again, with one hand on the dog's neck. He  trotted meekly beside her with head hanging. At the open baggage-car  door one of the brakemen lifted her in.    \"Come, Reno! Come up, sir!\" she said, and the great mastiff, crouching  for an instant, sprang into the car.    Even before they were fairly aboard, the train started. They were late  enough, indeed! But the engineer dared not speed up much for that last  mile of the lap to Cheslow. There might be something ahead on the  track.    \"You get out at Cheslow; don't you Miss?\" asked the conductor.    \"Yes, sir,\" returned Ruth, sitting down with an air of possession upon  her old-fashioned cowhide trunk that had already been put out by the  door ready for discharging at the next station.    \"And you were sitting in the last car. Have you a bag there?\"    \"Yes, sir, a small bag. That is all.\"    \"I'll send it forward to you,\" he said, not unkindly, and bustled  away.    And so Ruth Fielding was sitting on her own trunk, with her bag in her  lap, and the great mastiff lying on the floor of the baggage car  beside her, when the train slowed down and stopped beside the Cheslow  platform. She had not expected to arrive just in this way at her  journey's end.      CHAPTER III     WHAT HAS HAPPENED?    The baggage-car door was wheeled wide open again and the lamps on the  platform shone in. There was the forward brakeman to \"jump\" her down  from the high doorway, and Reno, with the little red light still hung  to his collar, bounded after her.    The conductor bustled away to tell the station master about the dog  with the red light, and of the word scrawled on the cloth which Ruth  had found wound around his collar. Indeed, Ruth herself was very  anxious and very much excited regarding this mystery; but she was  anxious, too, about herself. Was Uncle Jabez here to meet her? Or had  he sent somebody to take her to the Red Mill? He had been informed by  Miss True Pettis the week before on which train to expect his niece.    Carrying her bag and followed dejectedly by the huge mastiff, Ruth  started down the long platform. The conductor ran out of the station,  signalled the train crew with his hand, and lanterns waved the length  of the train. Panting, with its huge springs squeaking, the locomotive  started the string of cars. Faster and faster the train moved, and  before Ruth reached the pent-house roof of the little brick station,  the tail-lights of the last car had passed her.    A short, bullet-headed old man, with close-cropped, whitish-yellow  hair, atop of which was a boy's baseball cap, his face smoothly shaven  and deeply lined, and the stain of tobacco at either corner of his  mouth, was standing on the platform. He was not a nice looking old man  at all, he was dressed in shabby and patched garments, and his little  eyes seemed so sly that they were even trying to hide from each other  on either side of a hawksbill nose.    He began to eye Ruth curiously as the girl approached, and she, seeing  that he was the only person who gave her any attention, jumped to the  conclusion that this was Uncle Jabez. The thought shocked her. She  instinctively feared and disliked this queer looking old man. The lump  in her throat that would not be swallowed almost choked her again, and  she winked her eyes fast to keep from crying.    She would, in her fear and disappointment, have passed the old man by  without speaking had he not stepped in front of her.    \"Where d'ye wanter go, Miss?\" he whined, looking at her still more  sharply out of his narrow eyes. \"Yeou be a stranger here, eh?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" admitted Ruth.    \"Where are you goin'?\" asked the man again, and Ruth had enough Yankee  blood in her to answer the query by asking:    \"Are you Mr. Jabez Potter?\"    \"Me Jabez Potter? Why, ef I was Jabe Potter I'd be owing myself money,  that's what I'd be doin'. You warn't never lookin' for Jabe Potter?\"    Much relieved, Ruth admitted the fact frankly. \"He is my uncle, sir,\"  she said. \"I am going to live at the Red Mill.\"    The strange old man puckered up his lips into a whistle, and shook his  head, eyeing her all the time so slily that Ruth was more and more  thankful that he had not proven to be Uncle Jabez.    \"Do you know Mr. Potter?\" she asked, undecided what to do.    \"Do I know Jabe Potter?\" repeated the man. \"Well, I don't know much  good of him, I assure ye! I worked for him onct, I did. And I tell ye  he owes me money yet. You ax him if he don't owe Jasper Parloe money--  you jest ax him!\"    He began to get excited and did not seem at all inclined to step out  of Ruth's path. But just then somebody spoke to her and she turned to  see the station master and two or three other men with him.    \"This is the girl Mr. Mason spoke to me about, isn't it?\" the railroad  man asked. \"The conductor of the express, I mean. He said the dog  would mind you.\"    \"He seems to like me,\" she replied, turning to the mastiff that had  stood all this time close to her.    \"That is Tom Cameron's dog all right,\" said one of the other men. \"And  that lantern is off his motorcycle, I bet anything! He went through  town about dark on that contraption, and I shouldn't wonder if he's  got a tumble.\"    Ruth showed the station master, whose name was Curtis, the bit of  handkerchief with the appeal for help traced upon it.    \"That is blood,\" she said. \"You see it's blood, don't you? Can't  somebody take Reno and hunt for him? He must be very badly hurt.\"    \"Mason said he expected it was nothing but some fool joke of the boys.  But it doesn't look like a joke to me,\" Mr. Curtis said, gravely.  \"Come, Parloe, you know that patch of woods well enough, over beyond  the swamp and Hiram Jennings' big field. Isn't there a steep and rocky  road down there, that shoots off the Osago Lake pike?\"    \"The Wilkins Corners road--yep,\" said the old man, snappishly.    \"Then, can't you take the dog and see if you can find young Tom?\"    \"Who's going to pay me for it?\" snarled Jasper Parloe. \"I ain't got no  love for them Camerons. This here Tom is as sassy a boy as there is in  this county.\"    \"But he may be seriously hurt,\" said Ruth, looking angrily at Jasper  Parloe.    \"'Tain't nothin' to me--no more than your goin' out ter live with  Jabe Potter ain't nothin' to me,\" responded the old man, with an ugly  grin.    \"You're a pretty fellow, you are, Jasper!\" exclaimed Mr. Curtis, and  turned his back upon the fellow. \"I can't leave the station now--Ah!  here's Doctor Davison. He'll know what to do.\"    Doctor Davison came forward and put his hand upon Ruth's shoulder most  kindly. \"What is all this?\" he asked. \"And there is the mastiff. They  tell me you are a dog tamer, Miss Fielding.\"    He listened very closely to what Mr. Curtis had to say, and looked,  too, at the smeared handkerchief.    \"The dog can find him--no doubt of that. Come, boys, get some  lanterns and we'll go right along to the Wilkins Corners road and  search it.\" Then to Ruth he said: \"You are a brave girl, sure enough.\"    But when the party was ready to start, half a dozen strong,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#2)"],[1,"d.  That is if you're through telling me about my affairs,\" for Ned,  who had formerly worked in the Shopton bank, had recently been made  general financial manager of the interests of Tom and his father.  The  two were inventors and proverbially poor business men, though they had  amassed a fortune.    \"Your financial affairs are all right, Tom,\" said Ned.  \"I have just  been going over the books, and I'll submit a detailed report later.\"    The telephone bell rang and Tom picked up the instrument from the desk.  As he answered in the usual way and then listened a moment, a strange  look came over his face.    \"Well, this certainly is wonderful!\" he exclaimed, in much the same  manner as when he had finished reading the article about the idol.  \"It  certainly is a strange coincidence,\" he added, speaking in an aside to  Ned while he himself still listened to what was being told to him over  the telephone wire.          CHAPTER II    PROFESSOR BUMPER ARRIVES      \"What's the matter, Tom?  What is it?\" asked Ned Newton, attracted by  the strange manner of his chum at the telephone.  \"Has anything  happened?\"    But the young inventor was too busy listening to the unseen speaker to  answer his chum, even if he heard what Ned remarked, which is doubtful.    \"Well, I might as well wait until he is through,\" mused Ned, as he  started to leave the room.  Then as Tom motioned to him to remain, he  murmured: \"He may have something to say to me later.  But I wonder who  is talking to him.\"    There was no way of finding out, however, until Tom had a chance to  talk to Ned, and at present the young scientist was eagerly listening  to what came over the wire.  Occasionally Ned could hear him say:    \"You don't tell me! That is surprising!  Yes--yes! Of course if it's  true it means a big thing, I can understand that.  What's that?  No, I  couldn't make a promise like that.  I'm sorry, but----\"    Then the person at the other end of the wire must have plunged into  something very interesting and absorbing, for Tom did not again  interrupt by interjected remarks.    Tom  Swift, as has been said, was an inventor, as was his father.  Mr.  Swift was now rather old and feeble, taking only a nominal part in the  activities of the firm made up of himself and his son.  But his  inventions were still used, many of them being vital to the business  and trade of this country.    Tom and his father lived in the village of Shopton, New York, and their  factories covered many acres of ground.  Those who wish to read of the  earliest activities of Tom in the inventive line are referred to the  initial volume, \"Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle.\"  From then on he and  his father had many and exciting adventures.  In a motor boat, an  airship, and a submarine respectively the young inventor had gone  through many perils.  On some of the trips his chum, Ned Newton,  accompanied him, and very often in the party was a Mr. Wakefield Damon,  who had a curious habit of \"blessing\" everything that happened to  strike his fancy.    Besides Tom and his father, the Swift household was made up of  Eradicate Sampson, a colored man-of-all-work, who, with his mule  Boomerang, did what he could to keep the grounds around the house in  order.  There was also Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, Tom's mother  being dead.  Mr. Damon, living in a neighboring town, was a frequent  visitor in the Swift home.    Mary Nestor, a girl of Shopton, might also be mentioned.  She and Tom  were more than just good friends.  Tom had an idea that some day----.  But there, I promised not to tell that part, at least until the young  people themselves were ready to have a certain fact announced.    From one activity to another had Tom Swift gone, now constructing some  important invention for himself, as among others, when he made the  photo-telephone, or developed a great searchlight which he presented to  the Government for use in detecting smugglers on the border.    The book immediately preceding this is called \"Tom Swift and His Big  Tunnel,\" and deals with the efforts of the young inventor to help a  firm of contractors penetrate a mountain in Peru.  How this was done  and how, incidentally, the lost city of Pelone was discovered, bringing  joy to the heart of Professor Swyington Bumper, will be found fully set  forth in the book.    Tom had been back from the Peru trip for some months, when we again  find him interested in some of the work of Professor Bumper, as set  forth in the magazine mentioned.    \"Well, he certainly is having some conversation,\" reflected Ned, as,  after more than five minutes, Tom's ear was still at the receiver of  the instrument, into the transmitter of which he had said only a few  words.    \"All right,\" Tom finally answered, as he hung the receiver up, \"I'll be  here,\" and then he turned to Ned, whose curiosity had been growing with  the telephone talk, and remarked:    \"That certainly was wonderful!\"    \"What was?\" asked Ned.  \"Do you think I'm a mind reader to be able to  guess?\"    \"No, indeed! I beg your pardon.  I'll tell you at once.  But I couldn't  break away.  It was too important.  To whom do you think I was talking  just then?\"    \"I can imagine almost any one, seeing I know something of what you have  done.  It might be almost anybody from some person you met up in the  caves of ice to a red pygmy from the wilds of Africa.\"    \"I'm afraid neither of them would be quite up to telephone talk yet,\"  laughed Tom.  \"No, this was the gentleman who wrote that interesting  article about the idol of gold,\" and he motioned to the magazine Ned  held in his hand.    \"You don't mean Professor Bumper!\"    \"That's just whom I do mean.\"    \"What did he want?  Where did he call from?\"    \"He wants me to help organize an expedition to go to Central  America--to the Copan valley, to be exact--to look for this somewhat  mythical idol of gold.  Incidentally the professor will gather in any  other antiques of more or less value, if he can find any, and he hopes,  even if he doesn't find the idol, to get enough historical material for  half a dozen books, to say nothing of magazine articles.\"    \"Where did he call from; did you say?\"    \"I didn't say.  But it was a long-distance call from New York.  The  Professor stopped off there on his way from Boston, where he has been  lecturing before some society.  And now he's coming here to see me,\"  finished Tom.    \"What! Is he going to lecture here?\" cried Ned.  \"If he is, and spouts  a whole lot of that bone-dry stuff about the ancient Mayan civilization  and their antiquities, with side lights on how the old-time Indians  used to scalp their enemies, I'm going to the moving pictures! I'm  willing to be your financial manager, Tom Swift, but please don't ask  me to be a high-brow.  I wasn't built for that.\"    \"Nor I, Ned.  The professor isn't going to lecture.  He's only going to  talk, he says.\"    \"What about?\"    \"He's going to try to induce me to join his expedition to the Copan  valley.\"    \"Do you feel inclined to go?\"    \"No, Ned, I do not.  I've got too many other irons in the fire.  I  shall have to give the professor a polite but firm refusal.\"    \"Well, maybe you're right, Tom; and yet that idol of  gold--GOLD--weighing how many pounds did you say?\"    \"Oh, you're thinking of its money value, Ned, old man!\"    \"Yes, I'd like to see what a big chunk of gold like that would bring.  It must be quite a nugget.  But I'm not likely to get a glimpse of it  if you don't go with the professor.\"    \"I don't see how I can go, Ned.  But come over and meet the delightful  gentleman when he arrives.  I expect him day after to-morrow.\"    \"I'll be here,\" promised Ned; and then he went downtown to attend to  some matters connected with his new duties, which were much less  irksome than those he had had when he had been in the bank.    \"Well, Tom, have you heard any more about your friend?\" asked Ned, two  days later, as he came to the Swift home with some papers needing the  signature of the young inventor and his father.    \"You mean----?\"    \"Professor Bumper.\"    \"No, I haven't heard from him since he telephoned.  But I guess he'll  be here all right.  He's very punctual.  Did you see anything of my  giant Koku as you came in?\"    \"Yes, he and Eradicate were having an argument about who should move a  heavy casting from one of the shops.  Rad wanted to do it all alone,  but Koku said he was like a baby now.\"    \"Poor Rad is getting old,\" said Tom with a sigh.  \"But he has been very  faithful.  He and Koku never seem to get along well together.\"    Koku was an immense man, a veritable giant, one of two whom Tom had  brought back with him after an exciting trip to a strange land.  The  giant's strength was very useful to the young inventor.    \"Now Tom, about this business of leasing to the English Government the  right to manufacture that new explosive of yours,\" began Ned, plunging  into the business at hand.  \"I think if you stick out a little you can  get a better royalty price.\"    \"But I don't want to gouge 'em, Ned.  I'm satisfied with a fair profit.  The trouble with you is you think too much of money.  Now----\"    At that moment a voice was heard in the hall of the house saying:    \"Now, my dear lady, don't trouble yourself.  I can find my way in to  Tom Swift perfectly well by myself, and while I appreciate your  courtesy I do not want to trouble you.\"    \"No, don't come, Mrs. Baggert,\" added another voice.  \"Bless my hat  band, I think I know my way about the house by this time!\"    \"Mr. Damon!\" ejaculated Ned.    \"And Professor Bumper is with him,\" added Tom.  \"Come in!\" he cried,  opening the hall door, to confront a bald-headed man who stood peering  at our hero with bright snapping eyes, like those of some big bird  spying out the land from afar.  \"Come in, Professor Bumper; and you  too, Mr. Damon!\"          CHAPTER III    BLESSINGS AND ENTHUSIASM      Greetings and inquiries as to health having"]]]
