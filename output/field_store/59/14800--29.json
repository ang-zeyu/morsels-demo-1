Scarcely hinted it even.    \"And still the Boche did nothing to the Daleswood men. The bullets  had ceased altogether. That made it much quieter. The shells still  snarled over, bursting far, far away.    \"And Bob said tell of Daleswood itself, the old village, with queer  chimneys, of red brick, in the wood. There weren't houses like that  nowadays. They'd be building new ones and spoiling it, likely, after  the war. And that was all he had to say.    \"And nobody was for not putting down anything any one said. It was  all to go in on the chalk, as much as would go in the time. For they  all sort of understood that the Daleswood of what they called the good  old time was just the memories that those few men had of the days they  had spent there together. And that was the Daleswood they loved, and  wanted folks to remember. They were all agreed as to that. And then  they said how was they to write it down. And when it came to writing  there was so much to be said, not spread over a lot of paper I don't  mean, but going down so deep like, that it seemed to them how their  own talk wouldn't be good enough to say it. And they knew no other,  and didn't know what to do. I reckon they'd been reading magazines and  thought that writing had to be like that muck. Anyway, they didn't  know what to do. I reckon their talk would be good enough for  Daleswood when they loved Daleswood like that. But they didn't, and  they were puzzled.    \"The Boche was miles away behind them now, and his barrage with him.  Still in front he did nothing.    \"They talked it all over and over, did the Daleswood men. They tried  everything. But somehow or other they couldn't get near what they  wanted to say about old summer evenings. Time wore on. The bowlder was  smooth and ready, and that whole generation of Daleswood men could  find no words to say what was in their hearts about Daleswood. There  wasn't time to waste. And the only thing they thought of in the end  was 'Please, God, remember Daleswood just like it used to be.' And  Bill and Harry carved that on the chalk between them.    \"What happened to the Daleswood men? Why, nothing. There come one of  them counter-attacks, a regular bastard for Jerry. The French made it  and did the Boche in proper. I got the story from a man with a hell of  a great big hammer, long afterwards when that trench was well behind  our line. He was smashing up a huge great chunk of chalk because he  said they all felt it was so damn silly.\"          The Road      The battery Sergeant-Major was practically asleep. He was all worn out  by the continuous roar of bombardments that had been shaking the  dugouts and dazing his brains for weeks. He was pretty well fed up.    The officer commanding the battery, a young man in a very neat uniform  and of particularly high birth, came up and spat in his face. The  Sergeant-Major sprang to attention, received an order, and took a  stick at once and beat up the tired men. For a message had come to the  battery that some English (God punish them!) were making a road at X.    The gun was fired. It was one of those unlucky shots that come on days  when our luck is out. The shell, a 5.9, lit in the midst of the British  working party. It did the Germans little good. It did not stop the  deluge of shells that was breaking up their guns and was driving  misery down like a wedge into their spirits. It did not improve the  temper of the officer commanding the battery, so that the men suffered  as acutely as ever under the Sergeant-Major. But it stopped the road  for that day.    I seemed to see that road going on in a dream.    Another working party came along next day, with clay pipes and got to  work; and next day and the day after. Shells came, but went short or  over; the shell holes were neatly patched up; the road went on. Here  and there a tree had to be cut, but not often, not many of them were  left; it was mostly digging and grubbing up roots, and pushing  wheelbarrows along planks and duck-boards, and filling up with stones.  Sometimes the engineers would come: that was when streams were  crossed. The engineers made their bridges, and the infantry working  party went on with the digging and laying down stones. It was  monotonous work. Contours altered, soil altered, even the rock beneath  it, but the desolation never; they always worked in desolation and  thunder. And so the road went on.    They came to a wide river. They went through a great forest. They  passed the ruins of what must have been quite fine towns, big  prosperous towns with universities in them. I saw the infantry working  party with their stumpy clay pipes, in my dream, a long way on from  where that shell had lit, which stopped the road for a day. And behind  them curious changes came over the road at X. You saw the infantry  going up to the trenches, and going back along it into reserve. They  marched at first, but in a few days they were going up in motors, grey  busses with shuttered windows. And then the guns came along it, miles  and miles of guns, following after the thunder which was further off  over the hills. And then one day the cavalry came by. Then stores in  wagons, the thunder muttering further and further away. I saw  farm-carts going down the road at X. And then one day all manner of  horses and traps and laughing people, farmers and women and boys all  going by to X. There was going to be a fair.    And far away the road was growing longer and longer amidst, as always,  desolation and thunder. And one day far away from X the road grew very  fine indeed. It was going proudly through a mighty city, sweeping in  like a river; you would not think that it ever remembered duck-boards.  There were great palaces there, with huge armorial eagles blazoned in  stone, and all along each side of the road was a row of statues of  kings. And going down the road towards the palace, past the statues of  the kings, a tired procession was riding, full of the flags of the  Allies. And I looked at the flags in my dream, out of national pride  to see whether we led, or whether France or America. America went  before us, but I could not see the Union Jack in the van nor the  Tricolour either, nor the Stars and Stripes: Belgium led and then  Serbia, they that had suffered most.    And before the flags, and before the generals, I saw marching along on  foot the ghosts of the working party that were killed at X, gazing  about them in admiration as they went, at the great city and at the  palaces. And one man, wondering at the Sieges Allee, turned round to  the Lance Corporal in charge of the party: \"That is a fine road that  we made, Frank,\" he said.          An Imperial Monument      It is an early summer's morning: the dew is all over France: the train  is going eastwards. They are quite slow, those troop trains, and there  are few embankments or cuttings in those flat plains, so that you seem  to be meandering along through the very life of the people. The roads  come right down to the railways, and the sun is shining brightly over  the farms and the people going to work along the roads, so that you  can see their faces clearly as the slow train passes them by.    They are all women and boys that work on the farms; sometimes perhaps  you see a very old man, but nearly always women and boys; they are out  working early. They straighten up from their work as we go by and lift  their hands to bless us.    We pass by long rows of the tall French poplars, their branches cut  away all up the trunk, leaving only an odd round tuft at the top of  the tree; but little branches are growing all up the trunk now, and  the poplars are looking unkempt. It would be the young men who would  cut the branches of the poplars. They would cut them for some useful  thrifty purpose that I do not know; and then they would cut them  because they were always cut that way, as long ago as the times of the  old men's tales about France; but chiefly, I expect, because youth  likes to climb difficult trees; that is why they are clipped so very  high. And the trunks are all unkempt now.    We go on by many farms with their shapely red-roofed houses; they  stand there, having the air of the homes of an ancient people; they  would not be out of keeping with any romance that might come, or any  romance that has come in the long story of France, and the girls of  those red-roofed houses work all alone in the fields.    We pass by many willows and come to a great marsh. In a punt on some  open water an old man is angling. We come to fields again, and then to  a deep wood. France smiles about us in the open sunlight.    But towards evening we pass over the border of this pleasant country  into a tragical land of destruction and gloom. It is not only that  murder has walked here to and fro for years, until all the fields are  ominous with it, but the very fields themselves have been mutilated  until they are unlike fields, the woods have been shattered right down  to the anemones, and the houses have been piled in heaps of rubbish,  and the heaps of rubbish have been scattered by shells. We see no more  trees, no more houses, no more women, no cattle even now. We have come  to the abomination of desolation. And over it broods, and will  probably brood for ever, accursed by men and accursed by the very  fields, the hyena-like memory of the Kaiser, who has whitened so many  bones.    It may be some satisfaction to his selfishness to know that the  monument to it cannot pass away, to know that the shell holes go too  deep to be washed away by the healing rains of years, to know that the  wasted German generations will not in centuries gather up what has  been spilt on the Somme, or France recover in the sunshine of many  summers from all the misery that his devilish folly has caused. It is  likely to be to such as him a source of satisfaction, for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],[0,"The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#2)"],[1,"coat.    \"I shall make my fortune--to be  cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is  to be married on Christmas Day in the  morning, and he hath ordered a coat  and an embroidered waistcoat--\"    Then the tailor started; for  suddenly, interrupting him, from the  dresser at the other side of the kitchen  came a number of little noises--    Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!    \"Now what can that be?\" said the  Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from  his chair. The tailor crossed the  kitchen, and stood quite still beside  the dresser, listening, and peering  through his spectacles.    \"This is very peculiar,\" said the  Tailor of Gloucester, and he lifted up  the tea-cup which was upside down.      Out stepped a little live lady mouse,  and made a courtesy to the tailor!  Then she hopped away down off the  dresser, and under the wainscot.    The tailor sat down again by the  fire, warming his poor cold hands.  But all at once, from the dresser, there  came other little noises--    Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!    \"This is passing extraordinary!\"  said the Tailor of Gloucester, and  turned over another tea-cup, which  was upside down.    Out stepped a little gentleman  mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!    And out from under tea-cups and  from under bowls and basins, stepped  other and more little mice, who  hopped away down off the dresser  and under the wainscot.      The tailor sat down, close over the  fire, lamenting: \"One-and-twenty  buttonholes of cherry-coloured silk!  To be finished by noon of Saturday:  and this is Tuesday evening. Was it  right to let loose those mice,  undoubtedly the property of Simpkin?  Alack, I am undone, for I have no  more twist!\"    The little mice came out again and  listened to the tailor; they took notice  of the pattern of that wonderful coat.  They whispered to one another about  the taffeta lining and about little  mouse tippets.    And then suddenly they all ran  away together down the passage  behind the wainscot, squeaking and  calling to one another as they ran  from house to house.    Not one mouse was left in the  tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came  back. He set down the pipkin of milk  upon the dresser, and looked  suspiciously at the tea-cups. He  wanted his supper of little fat mouse!    \"Simpkin,\" said the tailor, \"where is  my TWIST?\"      But Simpkin hid a little parcel  privately in the tea-pot, and spit and  growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin  had been able to talk, he would have  asked: \"Where is my MOUSE?\"    \"Alack, I am undone!\" said the  Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly  to bed.    All that night long Simpkin hunted  and searched through the kitchen,  peeping into cupboards and under the  wainscot, and into the tea-pot where  he had hidden that twist; but still he  found never a mouse!    The poor old tailor was very ill with  a fever, tossing and turning in his  four-post bed; and still in his dreams  he mumbled: \"No more twist! no  more twist!\"    What should become of the cherry-  coloured coat? Who should come to  sew it, when the window was barred,  and the door was fast locked?      Out-of-doors the market folks went  trudging through the snow to buy  their geese and turkeys, and to bake  their Christmas pies; but there would  be no dinner for Simpkin and the poor  old tailor of Gloucester.    The tailor lay ill for three days and  nights; and then it was Christmas Eve,  and very late at night. And still  Simpkin wanted his mice, and mewed  as he stood beside the four-post bed.    But it is in the old story that all the  beasts can talk in the night between  Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in  the morning (though there are very  few folk that can hear them, or know  what it is that they say).    When the Cathedral clock struck  twelve there was an answer--like an  echo of the chimes--and Simpkin  heard it, and came out of the tailor's  door, and wandered about in the  snow.      From all the roofs and gables and  old wooden houses in Gloucester  came a thousand merry voices singing  the old Christmas rhymes--all the old  songs that ever I heard of, and some  that I don't know, like Whittington's  bells.    Under the wooden eaves the  starlings and sparrows sang of  Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up  in the Cathedral tower; and although  it was the middle of the night the  throstles and robins sang; and air was  quite full of little twittering tunes.    But it was all rather provoking to  poor hungry Simpkin.    From the tailor's ship in Westgate  came a glow of light; and when  Simpkin crept up to peep in at the  window it was full of candles. There  was a snippeting of scissors, and  snappeting of thread; and little mouse  voices sang loudly and gaily:              \"Four-and-twenty tailors            Went to catch a snail,            The best man amongst them            Durst not touch her tail;            She put out her horns            Like a little kyloe cow.            Run, tailors, run!            Or she'll have you all e'en now!\"      Then without a pause the little  mouse voices went on again:              \"Sieve my lady's oatmeal,            Grind my lady's flour,            Put it in a chestnut,            Let it stand an hour--\"      \"Mew! Mew!\" interrupted Simpkin,  and he scratched at the door. But the  key was under the tailor's pillow; he  could not get in.    The little mice only laughed, and  tried another tune--              \"Three little mice sat down to spin,            Pussy passed by and she peeped in.            What are you at, my fine little men?            Making coats for gentlemen.            Shall I come in and cut off yours threads?            Oh, no, Miss Pussy,            You'd bite off our heads!\"        \"Mew! scratch! scratch!\" scuffled  Simpkin on the window-sill; while the  little mice inside sprang to their feet,  and all began to shout all at once in  little twittering voices: \"No more  twist! No more twist!\" And they  barred up the window-shutters and  shut out Simpkin.    Simpkin came away from the shop  and went home considering in his  mind. He found the poor old tailor  without fever, sleeping peacefully.    Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and  took a little parcel of silk out of the  tea-pot; and looked at it in the  moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed  of his badness compared with those  good little mice!    When the tailor awoke in the  morning, the first thing which he saw,  upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein  of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and  beside his bed stood the repentant  Simpkin!      The sun was shining on the snow  when the tailor got up and dressed,  and came out into the street with  Simpkin running before him.    \"Alack,\" said the tailor, \"I have my  twist; but no more strength--nor  time--than will serve to make me one  single buttonhole; for this is  Christmas Day in the Morning! The  Mayor of Gloucester shall be married  by noon--and where is his cherry-  coloured coat?\"    He unlocked the door of the little  shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin  ran in, like a cat that expects  something.    But there was no one there! Not  even one little brown mouse!    But upon the table--oh joy! the  tailor gave a shout--there, where he  had left plain cuttings of silk--there  lay the most beautiful coat and  embroidered satin waistcoat that ever  were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester!      Everything was finished except just  one single cherry-coloured buttonhole,  and where that buttonhole was  wanting there was pinned a scrap of  paper with these words--in little  teeny weeny writing--              NO MORE TWIST.      And from then began the luck of  the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite  stout, and he grew quite rich.    He made the most wonderful  waistcoats for all the rich merchants  of Gloucester, and for all the fine  gentlemen of the country round.    Never were seen such ruffles, or  such embroidered cuffs and lappets!  But his buttonholes were the greatest  triumph of it all.    The stitches of those buttonholes  were so neat--SO neat--I wonder  how they could be stitched by an old  man in spectacles, with crooked old  fingers, and a tailor's thimble.    The stitches of those buttonholes  were so small--SO small--they looked  as if they had been made by little  mice!          THE TALE OF  SQUIRREL NUTKIN    [A Story for Norah]          This is a Tale about a tail--a tail  that belonged to a little red squirrel,  and his name was Nutkin.    He had a brother called  Twinkleberry, and a great many  cousins: they lived in a wood at the  edge of a lake.    In the middle of the lake there is an  island covered with trees and nut  bushes; and amongst those trees  stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the  house of an owl who is called Old  Brown.    One autumn when the nuts were  ripe, and the leaves on the hazel  bushes were golden and green--  Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the  other little squirrels came out of the  wood, and down to the edge of the  lake.    They made little rafts out of twigs,  and they paddled away over the  water to Owl Island to gather nuts.      Each squirrel had a little sack and a  large oar, and spread out his tail for a  sail.    They also took with them an  offering of three fat mice as a present  for Old Brown, and put them down  upon his door-step.    Then Twinkleberry and the other  little squirrels each made a low bow,  and said politely--    \"Old Mr. Brown, will you  favour us with permission to  gather nuts upon your island?\"    But Nutkin was excessively  impertinent in his manners. He  bobbed up and down like a little  red CHERRY, singing--         \"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!       A little wee man, in a red red coat!       A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;       If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.\"      Now this riddle is as old as the hills;  Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever  to Nutkin.    He shut his eyes obstinately and  went to sleep.      The squirrels filled their little sacks  with nuts, and"]]]
