As I came cautiously to the edge of the low cliff overlooking the  Lost Sea of Korus I saw Thurid pushing out upon the bosom of the  shimmering water in a small skiff--one of those strangely wrought craft  of unthinkable age which the Holy Therns, with their organization  of priests and lesser therns, were wont to distribute along the  banks of the Iss, that the long journey of their victims might be  facilitated.    Drawn up on the beach below me were a score of similar boats, each  with its long pole, at one end of which was a pike, at the other  a paddle.  Thurid was hugging the shore, and as he passed out of  sight round a near-by promontory I shoved one of the boats into  the water and, calling Woola into it, pushed out from shore.    The pursuit of Thurid carried me along the edge of the sea toward  the mouth of the Iss.  The farther moon lay close to the horizon,  casting a dense shadow beneath the cliffs that fringed the water.  Thuria, the nearer moon, had set, nor would it rise again for near  four hours, so that I was ensured concealing darkness for that  length of time at least.    On and on went the black warrior.  Now he was opposite the mouth  of the Iss.  Without an instant's hesitation he turned up the grim  river, paddling hard against the strong current.    After him came Woola and I, closer now, for the man was too intent  upon forcing his craft up the river to have any eyes for what might  be transpiring behind him.  He hugged the shore where the current  was less strong.    Presently he came to the dark cavernous portal in the face of the  Golden Cliffs, through which the river poured.  On into the Stygian  darkness beyond he urged his craft.    It seemed hopeless to attempt to follow him here where I could not  see my hand before my face, and I was almost on the point of giving  up the pursuit and drifting back to the mouth of the river, there  to await his return, when a sudden bend showed a faint luminosity  ahead.    My quarry was plainly visible again, and in the increasing light  from the phosphorescent rock that lay embedded in great patches  in the roughly arched roof of the cavern I had no difficulty in  following him.    It was my first trip upon the bosom of Iss, and the things I saw  there will live forever in my memory.    Terrible as they were, they could not have commenced to approximate  the horrible conditions which must have obtained before Tars Tarkas,  the great green warrior, Xodar, the black dator, and I brought  the light of truth to the outer world and stopped the mad rush of  millions upon the voluntary pilgrimage to what they believed would  end in a beautiful valley of peace and happiness and love.    Even now the low islands which dotted the broad stream were choked  with the skeletons and half devoured carcasses of those who, through  fear or a sudden awakening to the truth, had halted almost at the  completion of their journey.    In the awful stench of these frightful charnel isles haggard maniacs  screamed and gibbered and fought among the torn remnants of their  grisly feasts; while on those which contained but clean-picked  bones they battled with one another, the weaker furnishing sustenance  for the stronger; or with clawlike hands clutched at the bloated  bodies that drifted down with the current.    Thurid paid not the slightest attention to the screaming things  that either menaced or pleaded with him as the mood directed  them--evidently he was familiar with the horrid sights that  surrounded him.  He continued up the river for perhaps a mile; and  then, crossing over to the left bank, drew his craft up on a low  ledge that lay almost on a level with the water.    I dared not follow across the stream, for he most surely would have  seen me.  Instead I stopped close to the opposite wall beneath an  overhanging mass of rock that cast a dense shadow beneath it.  Here  I could watch Thurid without danger of discovery.    The black was standing upon the ledge beside his boat, looking up  the river, as though he were awaiting one whom he expected from  that direction.    As I lay there beneath the dark rocks I noticed that a strong  current seemed to flow directly toward the center of the river, so  that it was difficult to hold my craft in its position.  I edged  farther into the shadow that I might find a hold upon the bank;  but, though I proceeded several yards, I touched nothing; and  then, finding that I would soon reach a point from where I could  no longer see the black man, I was compelled to remain where I was,  holding my position as best I could by paddling strongly against  the current which flowed from beneath the rocky mass behind me.    I could not imagine what might cause this strong lateral flow, for  the main channel of the river was plainly visible to me from where  I sat, and I could see the rippling junction of it and the mysterious  current which had aroused my curiosity.    While I was still speculating upon the phenomenon, my attention  was suddenly riveted upon Thurid, who had raised both palms forward  above his head in the universal salute of Martians, and a moment  later his \"Kaor!\" the Barsoomian word of greeting, came in low but  distinct tones.    I turned my eyes up the river in the direction that his were bent,  and presently there came within my limited range of vision a long  boat, in which were six men.  Five were at the paddles, while the  sixth sat in the seat of honor.    The white skins, the flowing yellow wigs which covered their bald  pates, and the gorgeous diadems set in circlets of gold about their  heads marked them as Holy Therns.    As they drew up beside the ledge upon which Thurid awaited them,  he in the bow of the boat arose to step ashore, and then I saw that  it was none other than Matai Shang, Father of Therns.    The evident cordiality with which the two men exchanged greetings  filled me with wonder, for the black and white men of Barsoom were  hereditary enemies--nor ever before had I known of two meeting  other than in battle.    Evidently the reverses that had recently overtaken both peoples had  resulted in an alliance between these two individuals--at least  against the common enemy--and now I saw why Thurid had come so  often out into the Valley Dor by night, and that the nature of his  conspiring might be such as to strike very close to me or to my  friends.    I wished that I might have found a point closer to the two men  from which to have heard their conversation; but it was out of the  question now to attempt to cross the river, and so I lay quietly  watching them, who would have given so much to have known how close  I lay to them, and how easily they might have overcome and killed  me with their superior force.    Several times Thurid pointed across the river in my direction, but  that his gestures had any reference to me I did not for a moment  believe.  Presently he and Matai Shang entered the latter's boat,  which turned out into the river and, swinging round, forged steadily  across in my direction.    As they advanced I moved my boat farther and farther in beneath the  overhanging wall, but at last it became evident that their craft  was holding the same course.  The five paddlers sent the larger  boat ahead at a speed that taxed my energies to equal.    Every instant I expected to feel my prow crash against solid rock.  The light from the river was no longer visible, but ahead I saw  the faint tinge of a distant radiance, and still the water before  me was open.    At last the truth dawned upon me--I was following a subterranean  river which emptied into the Iss at the very point where I had  hidden.    The rowers were now quite close to me.  The noise of their  own paddles drowned the sound of mine, but in another instant the  growing light ahead would reveal me to them.    There was no time to be lost.  Whatever action I was to take must  be taken at once.  Swinging the prow of my boat toward the right,  I sought the river's rocky side, and there I lay while Matai Shang  and Thurid approached up the center of the stream, which was much  narrower than the Iss.    As they came nearer I heard the voices of Thurid and the Father of  Therns raised in argument.    \"I tell you, Thern,\" the black dator was saying, \"that I wish only  vengeance upon John Carter, Prince of Helium.  I am leading you  into no trap.  What could I gain by betraying you to those who have  ruined my nation and my house?\"    \"Let us stop here a moment that I may hear your plans,\" replied the  hekkador, \"and then we may proceed with a better understanding of  our duties and obligations.\"    To the rowers he issued the command that brought their boat in  toward the bank not a dozen paces beyond the spot where I lay.    Had they pulled in below me they must surely have seen me against  the faint glow of light ahead, but from where they finally came to  rest I was as secure from detection as though miles separated us.    The few words I had already overheard whetted my curiosity, and I  was anxious to learn what manner of vengeance Thurid was planning  against me.  Nor had I long to wait.  I listened intently.    \"There are no obligations, Father of Therns,\" continued the First  Born.  \"Thurid, Dator of Issus, has no price.  When the thing has  been accomplished I shall be glad if you will see to it that I am  well received, as is befitting my ancient lineage and noble rank,  at some court that is yet loyal to thy ancient faith, for I cannot  return to the Valley Dor or elsewhere within the power of the Prince  of Helium; but even that I do not demand--it shall be as your own  desire in the matter directs.\"    \"It shall be as you wish, Dator,\" replied Matai Shang; \"nor is that  all--power and riches shall be yours if you restore my daughter,  Phaidor, to me, and place within my power Dejah Thoris, Princess  of Helium.    \"Ah,\" he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/680"],[0,"The Golden Threshold (#2)"],[1,"sapphire sky; these scarlet lilies  that adorn the sunshine; the voluptuous scents of neem and  champak and serisha that beat upon the languid air with their  implacable sweetness; the thousand little gold and blue and  silver breasted birds bursting with the shrill ecstasy of life in  nesting time. All is hot and fierce and passionate, ardent and  unashamed in its exulting and importunate desire for life and  love. And, do you know that the scarlet lilies are woven petal by  petal from my heart's blood, these little quivering birds are my  soul made incarnate music, these heavy perfumes are my emotions  dissolved into aerial essence, this flaming blue and gold sky is  the 'very me,' that part of me that incessantly and insolently,  yes, and a little deliberately, triumphs over that other part--a  thing of nerves and tissues that suffers and cries out, and that  must die to-morrow perhaps, or twenty years hence.\"    Then there was her humour, which was part of her strange wisdom,  and was always awake and on the watch.  In all her letters,  written in exquisite English prose, but with an ardent imagery  and a vehement sincerity of emotion which make them, like the  poems, indeed almost more directly, un-English, Oriental, there  was always this intellectual, critical sense of humour, which  could laugh at one's own enthusiasm as frankly as that enthusiasm  had been set down.  And partly the humour, like the delicate  reserve of her manner, was a mask or a shelter.  \"I have taught  myself,\" she writes to me from India, \"to be commonplace and like  everybody else superficially.  Every one thinks I am so nice and  cheerful, so 'brave,' all the banal things that are so comfortable  to be.  My mother knows me only as 'such a tranquil child, but so  strong-willed.'  A tranquil child!\" And she writes again, with deeper  significance: \"I too have learnt the subtle philosophy of living from  moment to moment.  Yes, it is a subtle philosophy, though it appears  merely an epicurean doctrine: 'Eat, drink, and be merry, for  to-morrow we die.'  I have gone through so many yesterdays when I  strove with Death that I have realised to its full the wisdom of that  sentence; and it is to me not merely a figure of speech, but a  literal fact.  Any to-morrow I might die.  It is scarcely two months  since I came back from the grave:  is it worth while to be anything  but radiantly glad? Of all things that life or perhaps my temperament  has given me I prize the gift of laughter as beyond price.\"    Her desire, always, was to be \"a wild free thing of the air like  the birds, with a song in my heart.\"  A spirit of too much fire  in too frail a body, it was rarely that her desire was fully  granted.  But in Italy she found what she could not find in  England, and from Italy her letters are radiant.  \"This Italy is  made of gold,\" she writes from Florence, \"the gold of dawn and  daylight, the gold of the stars, and, now dancing in weird  enchanting rhythms through this magic month of May, the gold of  fireflies in the perfumed darkness--'aerial gold.'  I long to  catch the subtle music of their fairy dances and make a poem with  a rhythm like the quick irregular wild flash of their sudden  movements.  Would it not be wonderful?  One black night I stood  in a garden with fireflies in my hair like darting restless stars  caught in a mesh of darkness.  It gave me a strange sensation, as  if I were not human at all, but an elfin spirit.  I wonder why  these little things move me so deeply?  It is because I have a  most 'unbalanced intellect,' I suppose.\"  Then, looking out on  Florence, she cries, \"God! how beautiful it is, and how glad I am  that I am alive to-day!\"  And she tells me that she is drinking  in the beauty like wine, \"wine, golden and scented, and shining,  fit for the gods; and the gods have drunk it, the dead gods of  Etruria, two thousand years ago.  Did I say dead?  No, for the  gods are immortal, and one might still find them loitering in  some solitary dell on the grey hillsides of Fiesole.  Have I seen  them?  Yes, looking with dreaming eyes, I have found them sitting  under the olives, in their grave, strong, antique beauty--Etruscan  gods!\"    In Italy she watches the faces of the monks, and at one moment  longs to attain to their peace by renunciation, longs for Nirvana;  \"then, when one comes out again into the hot sunshine that warms  one's blood, and sees the eager hurrying faces of men and women  in the street, dramatic faces over which the disturbing experiences  of life have passed and left their symbols, one's heart thrills up  into one's throat.  No, no, no, a thousand times no! how can one  deliberately renounce this coloured, unquiet, fiery human life of  the earth?\"  And, all the time, her subtle criticism is alert, and  this woman of the East marvels at the women of the West, \"the  beautiful worldly women of the West,\" whom she sees walking in the  Cascine, \"taking the air so consciously attractive in their brilliant  toilettes, in the brilliant coquetry of their manner!\"  She finds  them \"a little incomprehensible,\" \"profound artists in all the subtle  intricacies of fascination,\" and asks if these \"incalculable  frivolities and vanities and coquetries and caprices\" are, to us,  an essential part of their charm?  And she watches them with  amusement as they flutter about her, petting her as if she were a  nice child, a child or a toy, not dreaming that she is saying to  herself sorrowfully:  \"How utterly empty their lives must be of  all spiritual beauty IF they are nothing more than they appear to be.\"    She sat in our midst, and judged us, and few knew what was  passing behind that face \"like an awakening soul,\" to use one of  her own epithets.  Her eyes were like deep pools, and you seemed  to fall through them into depths below depths.    ARTHUR SYMONS.        FOLK SONGS        PALANQUIN BEARERS      Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,    She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;    She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,    She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.    Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,    We bear her along like a pearl on a string.      Softly, O softly we bear her along,    She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;    She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,    She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.    Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,    We bear her along like a pearl on a string.        WANDERING SINGERS      (Written to one of their Tunes)      Where the voice of the wind calls our wandering feet,    Through echoing forest and echoing street,    With lutes in our hands ever-singing we roam,    All men are our kindred, the world is our home.      Our lays are of cities whose lustre is shed,    The laughter and beauty of women long dead;    The sword of old battles, the crown of old kings,    And happy and simple and sorrowful things.      What hope shall we gather, what dreams shall we sow?    Where the wind calls our wandering footsteps we go.    No love bids us tarry, no joy bids us wait:    The voice of the wind is the voice of our fate.        INDIAN WEAVERS      Weavers, weaving at break of day,    Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . .    Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild,    We weave the robes of a new-born child.      Weavers, weaving at fall of night,    Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . .    Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green,    We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.      Weavers, weaving solemn and still,    What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . .    White as a feather and white as a cloud,    We weave a dead man's funeral shroud.        COROMANDEL FISHERS      Rise, brothers, rise, the wakening skies pray         to the morning light,    The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn         like a child that has cried all night.    Come, let us gather our nets from the shore,         and set our catamarans free,    To capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for         we are the sons of the sea.      No longer delay, let us hasten away in the         track of the sea-gull's call,    The sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother,         the waves are our comrades all.    What though we toss at the fall of the sun         where the hand of the sea-god drives?    He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide         in his breast our lives.      Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and         the scent of the mango grove,    And sweet are the sands at the full o' the         moon with the sound of the voices we love.    But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray         and the dance of the wild foam's glee:    Row, brothers, row to the blue of the verge,         where the low sky mates with the sea.        THE SNAKE-CHARMER      Whither dost thou hide from the magic of my flute-call?    In what moonlight-tangled meshes of perfume,    Where the clustering keovas guard the squirrel's slumber,    Where the deep woods glimmer with the jasmine's bloom?      I'll feed thee, O beloved, on milk and wild red honey,    I'll bear thee in a basket of rushes, green and white,    To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens    Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight.      Whither dost thou loiter, by what murmuring hollows,    Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire?    Come, thou subtle bride of my mellifluous wooing,    Come, thou silver-breasted moonbeam of desire!        CORN-GRINDERS      O LITTLE MOUSE, WHY DOST THOU CRY    WHILE MERRY STARS LAUGH IN THE SKY?      Alas! alas! my lord is dead!    Ah, who will ease my bitter pain?    He went to seek a millet-grain    In the rich farmer's granary shed;    They caught him in a baited snare,    And slew my lover unaware:    Alas! alas! my lord is dead.      O LITTLE DEER, WHY DOST THOU MOAN,    HID IN THY FOREST-BOWER ALONE?      Alas! alas! my lord is dead!    Ah! who will quiet my lament?      At fall of"]]]
