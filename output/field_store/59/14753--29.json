They knew exactly what they were going to do, and exactly how to  do it. They waited.    \"My visualization is not entirely clear concerning the succession of  events stemming from the fact that the fusion of which Drounli is  a part did not destroy Gharlane of Eddore while he was energizing  Gray Roger,\" a young Watchman, Eukonidor by symbol, thought into the  assembled mind. \"May I take a moment of this idle time in which to  spread my visualization, for enlargement and instruction?\"    \"You may, youth.\" The Elders of Arisia--the mightiest intellects of  that tremendously powerful race--fused their several minds into one  mind and gave approval. \"That will be time well spent. Think on.\"    \"Separated from the other Eddorians by inter-galactic distance as  he then was, Gharlane could have been isolated and could have been  destroyed,\" the youth pointed out, as he somewhat diffidently spread  his visualization in the public mind. \"Since it is axiomatic that his  destruction would have weakened Eddore somewhat and to that extent  would have helped us, it is evident that some greater advantage will  accrue from allowing him to live. Some points are clear enough: that  Gharlane and his fellows will believe that the Arisian fusion could  not kill him, since it did not; that the Eddorians, contemptuous of our  powers and thinking us vastly their inferiors, will not be driven to  develop such things as atomic-energy-powered mechanical screens against  third-level thought until such a time as it will be too late for even  those devices to save their race from extinction; that they will, in  all probability, never even suspect that the Galactic Patrol which is  so soon to come into being will in fact be the prime operator in that  extinction. It is not clear, however, in view of the above facts, why  it has now become necessary for us to slay one Eddorian upon Eddore.  Nor can I formulate or visualize with any clarity the techniques  to be employed in the final wiping out of the race; I lack certain  fundamental data concerning events which occurred and conditions which  obtained many, many cycles before my birth. I am unable to believe that  my perception and memory could have been so imperfect--can it be that  none of that basic data is, or ever has been available?\"    \"That, youth, is the fact. While your visualization of the future is of  course not as detailed nor as accurate as it will be after more cycles  of labor, your background of knowledge is as complete as that of any  other of our number.\"    \"I see.\" Eukonidor gave the mental equivalent of a nod of complete  understanding. \"It is necessary, and the death of a lesser Eddorian--a  Watchman--will be sufficient. Nor will it be either surprising or  alarming to Eddore's Innermost Circle that the integrated total mind of  Arisia should be able to kill such a relatively feeble entity. I see.\"    Then silence; and waiting. Minutes? Or days? Or weeks? Who can tell?  What does time mean to any Arisian?    Then Drounli arrived; arrived in the instant of his leaving The  Hill--what matters even inter-galactic distance to the speed of  thought? He fused his mind with those of the three other Molders  of Civilization. The massed and united mind of Arisia, poised and  ready, awaiting only his coming, launched itself through space. That  tremendous, that theretofore unknown concentration of mental force  arrived at Eddore's outer screen in practically the same instant as  did the entity that was Gharlane. The Eddorian, however, went through  without opposition; the Arisians did not.           *       *       *       *       *    Some two thousand million years ago, when the Coalescence occurred--the  event which was to make each of the two interpassing galaxies teem with  planets--the Arisians were already an ancient race; so ancient that  they were even then independent of the chance formation of planets. The  Eddorians, it is believed, were older still. The Arisians were native  to this, our normal space-time continuum; the Eddorians were not.    Eddore was--and is--huge, dense, and hot. Its atmosphere is not air,  as we of small, green Terra, know air, but is a noxious mixture of  gaseous substances known to mankind only in chemical laboratories.  Its hydrosphere, while it does contain some water, is a poisonous,  stinking, foully corrosive, slimy and sludgy liquid.    And the Eddorians were as different from any people we know as Eddore  is different from the planets indigenous to our space and time. They  were, to our senses, utterly monstrous; almost incomprehensible. They  were amorphous, amoeboid, sexless. Not androgynous or parthenogenetic,  but absolutely sexless; with a sexlessness unknown in any Earthly form  of life higher than the yeasts. Thus they were, to all intents and  purposes and except for death by violence, immortal; for each one,  after having lived for hundreds of thousands of Tellurian years and  having reached its capacity to live and to learn, simply divided into  two new individuals, each of which, in addition to possessing in full  its parent's mind and memories and knowledges, had also a brand-new  zest and a greatly increased capacity.    And, since life was, there had been competition. Competition for power.  Knowledge was worth while only insofar as it contributed to power.  Warfare began, and aged, and continued; the appallingly efficient  warfare possible only to such entities as those. Their minds, already  immensely powerful, grew stronger and stronger under the stresses of  internecine struggle.    But peace was not even thought of. Strife continued, at higher and even  higher levels of violence, until two facts became apparent. First, that  every Eddorian who could be killed by physical violence had already  died; that the survivors had developed such tremendous powers of mind,  such complete mastery of things physical as well as mental, that they  could not be slain by physical force. Second, that during the ages  through which they had been devoting their every effort to mutual  extermination, their sun had begun markedly to cool; that their planet  would very soon become so cold that it would be impossible for them  ever again to live their normal physical lives.    Thus there came about an armistice. The Eddorians worked together--not  without friction--in the development of mechanisms by the use of which  they moved their planet across light-years of space to a younger,  hotter sun. Then, Eddore once more at its hot and reeking norm, battle  was resumed. Mental battle, this time, that went on for more than a  hundred thousand Eddorian years; during the last ten thousand of which  not a single Eddorian died.    Realizing the futility of such unproductive endeavor, the relatively  few survivors made a peace of sorts. Since each had an utterly  insatiable lust for power, and since it had become clear that they  could neither conquer nor kill each other, they would combine forces  and conquer enough planets--enough galaxies--so that each Eddorian  could have as much power and authority as he could possibly handle.    What matter that there were not that many planets in their native  space? There were other spaces, an infinite number of them; some of  which, it was mathematically certain, would contain millions upon  millions of planets instead of only two or three. By mind and by  machine they surveyed the neighboring continua; they developed the  hyper-spatial tube and the inertialess drive; they drove their planet,  space-ship-wise, through space after space after space.    And thus, shortly after the Coalescence began, Eddore came into our  space-time; and here, because of the multitudes of planets already  existing and the untold millions more about to come into existence,  it stayed. Here was what they had wanted since their beginnings; here  were planets enough, here were fields enough for the exercise of power,  to sate even the insatiable. There was no longer any need for them to  fight each other; they could now cooperate whole-heartedly--as long as  each was getting more--and _more_ and MORE!    Enphilisor, a young Arisian, his mind roaming eagerly abroad as was its  wont, made first contact with the Eddorians in this space. Inoffensive,  naive, innocent, he was surprised beyond measure at their reception of  his friendly greeting; but in the instant before closing his mind to  their vicious attacks, he learned the foregoing facts concerning them.    The fused mind of the Elders of Arisia, however, was not surprised. The  Arisians, while not as mechanistic as their opponents, and innately  peaceful as well, were far ahead of them in the pure science of the  mind. The Elders had long known of the Eddorians and of their lustful  wanderings through plenum after plenum. Their Visualizations of the  Cosmic All had long since forecast, with dreadful certainty, the  invasion which had now occurred. They had long known what they would  have to do. They did it. So insidiously as to set up no opposition they  entered the Eddorians' minds and sealed off all knowledge of Arisia.  They withdrew, tracelessly.    They did not have much data, it is true; but no more could be obtained  at that time. If any one of those touchy suspicious minds had been  given any cause for alarm, any focal point of doubt, they would have  had time in which to develop mechanisms able to force the Arisians out  of this space before a weapon to destroy the Eddorians--the as yet  incompletely designed Galactic Patrol--could be forged. The Arisians  could, even then, have slain by mental force alone all the Eddorians  except the All-Highest and his Innermost Circle, safe within their then  impenetrable shield; but as long as they could not make a clean sweep  they could not attack--then.    Be it observed that the Arisians were not fighting for themselves. As  individuals or as a race they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#2)"],[1,"impression. On the one hand, bacteria were not recognised as a  class of organisms by themselves--were not, indeed, distinguished  from yeasts or other minute animalcuise. Their variety was not  mistrusted and their significance not conceived. As microscopic  organisms, there were no reasons for considering them of any more  importance than any other small animals or plants, and their  extreme minuteness and simplicity made them of little interest to  the microscopist. On the other hand, their causal connection with  fermentative and putrefactive processes was entirely obscured by  the overshadowing weight of the chemist Liebig, who believed that  fermentations and putrefactions were simply chemical processes.  Liebig insisted that all albuminoid bodies were in a state of  chemically unstable equilibrium, and if left to themselves would  fall to pieces without any need of the action of microscopic  organisms. The force of Liebig's authority and the brilliancy of  his expositions led to the wide acceptance of his views and the  temporary obscurity of the relation of microscopic organisms to  fermentative and putrefactive processes. The objections to  Liebig's views were hardly noticed, and the force of the  experiments of Schwann was silently ignored. Until the sixth  decade of the century, therefore, these organisms, which have  since become the basis of a new branch of science, had hardly  emerged from obscurity. A few microscopists recognised their  existence, just as they did any other group of small animals or  plants, but even yet they failed to look upon them as forming a  distinct group. A growing number of observations was accumulating,  pointing toward a probable causal connection between fermentative  and putrefactive processes and the growth of microscopic  organisms; but these observations were known only to a few, and  were ignored by the majority of scientists.    It was Louis Pasteur who brought bacteria to the front, and it was  by his labours that these organisms were rescued from the  obscurity of scientific publications and made objects of general  and crowning interest. It was Pasteur who first successfully  combated the chemical theory of fermentation by showing that  albuminous matter had no inherent tendency to decomposition. It  was Pasteur who first clearly demonstrated that these little  bodies, like all larger animals and plants, come into existence  only by ordinary methods of reproduction, and not by any  spontaneous generation, as had been earlier claimed. It was  Pasteur who first proved that such a common phenomenon as. the  souring of milk was produced by microscopic organisms growing in  the milk. It was Pasteur who first succeeded in demonstrating that  certain species of microscopic organisms are the cause of certain  diseases, and in suggesting successful methods of avoiding them.  All these discoveries were made in rapid succession. Within ten  years of the time that his name began to be heard in this  connection by scientists, the subject had advanced so rapidly that  it had become evident that here was a new subject of importance to  the scientific world, if not to the public at large. The other  important discoveries which Pasteur made it is not our purpose to  mention here. His claim to be considered the founder of  bacteriology will be recognised from what has already been  mentioned. It was not that he first discovered the organisms, or  first studied them; it was not that he first suggested their  causal connection with fermentation and disease, but it was  because he for the first time placed the subject upon a firm  foundation by proving with rigid experiment some of the  suggestions made by others, and in this way turned the attention  of science to the study of micro-organisms.    After the importance of the subject had been demonstrated by  Pasteur, others turned their attention in the same direction,  either for the purpose of verification or refutation of Pasteur's  views. The advance was not very rapid, however, since  bacteriological experimentation proved to be a subject of  extraordinary difficulty. Bacteria were not even yet recognised as  a group of organisms distinct enough to be grouped by themselves,  but were even by Pasteur at first confounded with yeasts. As a  distinct group of organisms they were first distinguished by  Hoffman in 1869, since which date the term bacteria, as applying  to this special group of organisms, has been coming more and more  into use. So difficult were the investigations, that for years  there were hardly any investigators besides Pasteur who could  successfully handle the subject and reach conclusions which could  stand the test of time. For the next thirty years, although  investigators and investigations continued to increase, we can  find little besides dispute and confusion along this line. The  difficulty of obtaining for experiment any one kind of bacteria by  itself, unmixed with others (pure cultures), rendered advance  almost impossible. So conflicting were the results that the whole  subject soon came into almost hopeless confusion, and very few  steps were taken upon any sure basis. So difficult were the  methods, so contradictory and confusing the results, because of  impure cultures, that a student of to-day who wishes to look up  the previous discoveries in almost any line of bacteriology need  hardly go back of 1880, since he can almost rest assured that  anything done earlier than that was more likely to be erroneous  than correct.    The last fifteen years have, however, seen a wonderful change. The  difficulties had been mostly those of methods of work, and with  the ninth decade of the century these methods were simplified by  Robert Koch. This simplification of method for the first time  placed this line of investigation within the reach of scientists  who did not have the genius of Pasteur. It was now possible to get  pure cultures easily, and to obtain with such pure cultures  results which were uniform and simple. It was now possible to take  steps which had the stamp of accuracy upon them, and which further  experiment did not disprove. From the time when these methods were  thus made manageable the study of bacteria increased with a  rapidity which has been fairly startling, and the information  which has accumulated is almost formidable. The very rapidity with  which the investigations have progressed has brought considerable  confusion, from the fact that the new discoveries have not had  time to be properly assimilated into knowledge. Today many facts  are known whose significance is still uncertain, and a clear  logical discussion of the facts of modern bacteriology is not  possible. But sufficient knowledge has been accumulated and  digested to show us at least the direction along which  bacteriological advance is tending, and it is to the pointing out  of these directions that the following pages will be devoted.    WHAT ARE BACTERIA?    The most interesting facts connected with the subject of  bacteriology concern the powers and influence in Nature possessed  by the bacteria. The morphological side of the subject is  interesting enough to the scientist, but to him alone. Still, it  is impossible to attempt to study the powers of bacteria without  knowing something of the organisms themselves. To understand how  they come to play an important part in Nature's processes, we must  know first how they look and where they are found. A short  consideration of certain morphological facts will therefore be  necessary at the start.    FORM OF BACTERIA.    In shape bacteria are the simplest conceivable structures.  Although there are hundreds of different species, they have only  three general forms, which have been aptly compared to billiard  balls, lead pencils, and corkscrews. Spheres, rods, and spirals  represent all shapes. The spheres may be large or small, and may  group themselves in various ways; the rods may be long or short,  thick or slender; the spirals may be loosely or tightly coiled,  and may have only one or two or may have many coils, and they may  be flexible or stiff; but still rods, spheres, and spirals  comprise all types.    In size there is some variation, though not very great. All are  extremely minute, and never visible to the naked eye. The spheres  vary from 0.25 u to 1.5 u (0.000012 to 0.00006 inches). The rods  may be no more than 0.3 u in diameter, or may be as wide as 1.5 u  to 2.5 u, and in length vary all the way from a length scarcely  longer than their diameter to long threads. About the same may be  said of the spiral forms. They are decidedly the smallest living  organisms which our microscopes have revealed.    In their method of growth we find one of the most characteristic  features. They universally have the power of multiplication by  simple division or fission. Each individual elongates and then  divides in the middle into two similar halves, each of which then  repeats the process. This method of multiplication by simple  division is the distinguishing mark which separates the bacteria  from the yeasts, the latter plants multiplying by a process known  as budding. Fig. 2 shows these two methods of multiplication.    While all bacteria thus multiply by division, certain differences  in the details produce rather striking differences in the results.  Considering first the spherical forms, we find that some species  divide, as described, into two, which separate at once, and each  of which in turn divides in the opposite direction, called  Micrococcus, (Fig. 3). Other species divide only in one direction.  Frequently they do not separate after dividing, but remain  attached. Each, however, again elongates and divides again, but  all still remain attached. There are thus formed long chains of  spheres like strings of beads, called Streptococci (Fig. 4). Other  species divide first in one direction, then at right angles to the  first division, and a "]]]
