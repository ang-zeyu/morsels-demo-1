But whene'er the sinner's cheek  Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears  Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel  Of justice doth run counter to the edge.  Howe'er that thou may'st profit by thy shame  For errors past, and that henceforth more strength  May arm thee, when thou hear'st the Siren-voice,  Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,  And lend attentive ear, while I unfold  How opposite a way my buried flesh  Should have impell'd thee.  Never didst thou spy  In art or nature aught so passing sweet,  As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame  Enclos'd me, and are scatter'd now in dust.  If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,  What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish  Have tempted?  When thou first hadst felt the dart  Of perishable things, in my departing  For better realms, thy wing thou should'st have prun'd  To follow me, and never stoop'd again  To 'bide a second blow for a slight girl,  Or other gaud as transient and as vain.  The new and inexperienc'd bird awaits,  Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler's aim;  But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,  In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing'd.\"    I stood, as children silent and asham'd  Stand, list'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,  Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn'd.  And she resum'd: \"If, but to hear thus pains thee,  Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!\"    With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,  Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows  From off the pole, or from Iarbas' land,  Than I at her behest my visage rais'd:  And thus the face denoting by the beard,  I mark'd the secret sting her words convey'd.    No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,  Than downward sunk that vision I beheld  Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes  Yet unassur'd and wavering, bent their light  On Beatrice.  Towards the animal,  Who joins two natures in one form, she turn'd,  And, even under shadow of her veil,  And parted by the verdant rill, that flow'd  Between, in loveliness appear'd as much  Her former self surpassing, as on earth  All others she surpass'd.  Remorseful goads  Shot sudden through me.  Each thing else, the more  Its love had late beguil'd me, now the more  I Was loathsome.  On my heart so keenly smote  The bitter consciousness, that on the ground  O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,  She knows who was the cause.  When now my strength  Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart,  The lady, whom alone I first had seen,  I found above me.  \"Loose me not,\" she cried:  \"Loose not thy hold;\" and lo! had dragg'd me high  As to my neck into the stream, while she,  Still as she drew me after, swept along,  Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave.    The blessed shore approaching then was heard  So sweetly, \"Tu asperges me,\" that I  May not remember, much less tell the sound.  The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd  My temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit  The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,  Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs  Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm  They each did cover me.  \"Here are we nymphs,  And in the heav'n are stars.  Or ever earth  Was visited of Beatrice, we  Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.  We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light  Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,  Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,  Thy sight shall quicken.\"  Thus began their song;  And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,  While, turn'd toward us, Beatrice stood.  \"Spare not thy vision.  We have stationed thee  Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile  Hath drawn his weapons on thee.\"  As they spake,  A thousand fervent wishes riveted  Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood  Still fix'd toward the Gryphon motionless.  As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus  Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,  For ever varying, in one figure now  Reflected, now in other.  Reader! muse  How wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark  A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,  Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.    Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul  Fed on the viand, whereof still desire  Grows with satiety, the other three  With gesture, that declar'd a loftier line,  Advanc'd: to their own carol on they came  Dancing in festive ring angelical.    \"Turn, Beatrice!\" was their song: \"O turn  Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,  Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace  Hath measur'd.  Gracious at our pray'r vouchsafe  Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark  Thy second beauty, now conceal'd.\"  O splendour!  O sacred light eternal! who is he  So pale with musing in Pierian shades,  Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,  Whose spirit should not fail him in th' essay  To represent thee such as thou didst seem,  When under cope of the still-chiming heaven  Thou gav'st to open air thy charms reveal'd.          CANTO XXXII    Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,  Were bent to rid them of their ten years' thirst,  No other sense was waking: and e'en they  Were fenc'd on either side from heed of aught;  So tangled in its custom'd toils that smile  Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,  When forcibly toward the left my sight  The sacred virgins turn'd; for from their lips  I heard the warning sounds: \"Too fix'd a gaze!\"    Awhile my vision labor'd; as when late  Upon the' o'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:  But soon to lesser object, as the view  Was now recover'd (lesser in respect  To that excess of sensible, whence late  I had perforce been sunder'd) on their right  I mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn,  Against the sun and sev'nfold lights, their front.  As when, their bucklers for protection rais'd,  A well-rang'd troop, with portly banners curl'd,  Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:  E'en thus the goodly regiment of heav'n  Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car  Had slop'd his beam.  Attendant at the wheels  The damsels turn'd; and on the Gryphon mov'd  The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,  No feather on him trembled.  The fair dame  Who through the wave had drawn me, companied  By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,  Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch.    Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,  Who by the serpent was beguil'd) I past  With step in cadence to the harmony  Angelic.  Onward had we mov'd, as far  Perchance as arrow at three several flights  Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down  Descended Beatrice.  With one voice  All murmur'd  \"Adam,\" circling next a plant  Despoil'd of flowers and leaf on every bough.  Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,  Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds for height  The Indians might have gaz'd at.  \"Blessed thou!  Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree  Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite  Was warp'd to evil.\"  Round the stately trunk  Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return'd  The animal twice-gender'd: \"Yea: for so  The generation of the just are sav'd.\"  And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot  He drew it of the widow'd branch, and bound  There left unto the stock whereon it grew.    As when large floods of radiance from above  Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends  Next after setting of the scaly sign,  Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew  His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok'd  Beneath another star his flamy steeds;  Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,  And deeper than the violet, was renew'd  The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.    Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.  I understood it not, nor to the end  Endur'd the harmony.  Had I the skill  To pencil forth, how clos'd th' unpitying eyes  Slumb'ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid  So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,  That with a model paints, I might design  The manner of my falling into sleep.  But feign who will the slumber cunningly;  I pass it by to when I wak'd, and tell  How suddenly a flash of splendour rent  The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:  \"Arise, what dost thou?\"  As the chosen three,  On Tabor's mount, admitted to behold  The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit  Is coveted of angels, and doth make  Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves  Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps  Were broken, that they their tribe diminish'd saw,  Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang'd  The stole their master wore: thus to myself  Returning, over me beheld I stand  The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought  My steps.  \"And where,\" all doubting, I exclaim'd,  \"Is Beatrice?\"--\"See her,\" she replied,  \"Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.  Behold th' associate choir that circles her.  The others, with a melody more sweet  And more profound, journeying to higher realms,  Upon the Gryphon tend.\"  If there her words  Were clos'd, I know not; but mine eyes had now  Ta'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts  Were barr'd admittance.  On the very ground  Alone she sat, as she had there been left  A guard upon the wain, which I beheld  Bound to the twyform beast.  The seven nymphs  Did make themselves a cloister round about her,  And in their hands upheld those lights secure  From blast septentrion and the gusty south.    \"A little while thou shalt be forester here:  And citizen shalt be forever with me,  Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman  To profit the misguided world, keep now  Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,  Take heed thou write, returning to that place.\"    Thus Beatrice:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#20)"],[1,"increase in such transmission by the rotary press has also tended to  muddy the current thought of the time? True it is that the  printing-press has piled up great treasures of human knowledge which  make this age the richest in accessible information. I am not speaking  of knowledge, but rather of the current thought of the living  generation.    I gravely question whether it has the same clarity as the brain of the  generation which fashioned the Constitution of the United States. Our  fathers could not talk over the telephone for three thousand miles, but  have we surpassed them in thoughts of enduring value? Washington and  Franklin could not travel sixty miles an hour in a railroad train, or  twice that speed in an aeroplane, but does it follow that they did not  travel to as good purpose as we, who scurry to and fro like the ants in  a disordered ant-heap?    Unquestionably, man of to-day has a thousand ideas suggested to him by  the newspaper and the library where our ancestors had one; but have we  the same spirit of calm inquiry and do we co-ordinate the facts we know  as wisely as our ancestors did?    Athens in the days of Pericles had but thirty thousand people and few  mechanical inventions; but she produced philosophers, poets and artists,  whose work after more than twenty centuries still remain the despair of  the would-be imitators.    Shakespeare had a theatre with the ground as its floor and the sky as  its ceiling; but New York, which has fifty theatres and annually spends  $100,000,000 in the box offices of its varied amusement resorts, has  rarely in two centuries produced a play that has lived.    To-day, man has a cinematographic brain. A thousand images are impressed  daily upon the screen of his consciousness, but they are as fleeting as  moving pictures in a cinema theatre. The American Press prints every  year over 29,000,000,000 issues. No one can question its educational  possibilities, for the best of all colleges is potentially the  University of Gutenberg. If it printed only the truth, its value would  be infinite; but who can say in what proportions of this vast volume of  printed matter is the true and the false? The framers of the  Constitution had few books and fewer newspapers. Their thoughts were few  and simple, but what they lacked in quantity they made up in unsurpassed  quality.    Before the beginning of the present mechanical age, the current of  living thought could be likened to a mountain stream, which though  confined within narrow banks yet had waters of transparent clearness.  May not the current thought of our time be compared with the mighty  Mississippi in the period of a spring freshet? Its banks are wide and  its current is swift, but the turbid stream that flows onward is one of  muddy swirls and eddies and overflows its banks to their destruction.    The great indictment, however, of the present age of mechanical power is  that it has largely destroyed the spirit of work. The great enigma which  it propounds to us, and which, like the riddle of the Sphinx, we will  solve or be destroyed, is this:    _Has the increase in the potential of human power, through  thermodynamics, been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the  potential of human character?_    To this life and death question, a great French philosopher, Le Bon,  writing in 1910, replied that the one unmistakable symptom of human life  was \"the increasing deterioration in human character,\" and a great  physicist has described the symptom as \"the progressive enfeeblement of  the human will.\"    In a famous book, _Degeneration_, written at the close of the nineteenth  century, Max Nordau, as a pathologist, explains this tendency by arguing  that our complex civilization has placed too great a strain upon the  limited nervous organization of man.    A great financier, the elder J.P. Morgan, once said of an existing  financial condition that it was suffering from \"undigested securities,\"  and, paraphrasing him, is it not possible that man is suffering from  undigested achievements and that his salvation must lie in adaptation to  a new environment, which, measured by any standard known to science, is  a thousandfold greater in this year of grace than it was at the  beginning of the nineteenth century?    No one would be mad enough to urge such a retrogression as the  abandonment of labour-saving machinery would involve. Indeed, it would  be impossible; for, in speaking of its evils, I freely recognize that  not only would civilization perish without its beneficent aid, but that  every step forward in the history of man has been coincident with, and  in large part attributable to, a new mechanical invention.    But suppose the development of labour-saving machinery should reach a  stage where all human labour was eliminated, what would be the effect on  man? The answer is contained in an experiment which Sir John Lubbock  made with a tribe of ants. Originally the most voracious and militant of  their species, yet when denied the opportunity for exercise and freed  from the necessity of foraging for their food, in three generations they  became anaemic and perished.    Take from man the opportunity of work and the sense of pride in  achievement and you have taken from him the very life of his existence.  Robert Burns could sing as he drove his ploughshare through the fields  of Ayr. To-day millions who simply watch an automatic infallible  machine, which requires neither strength nor skill, do not sing at their  work but too many curse the fate, which has chained them, like Ixion, to  a soulless machine.    The evil is even greater.    The specialization of our modern mechanical civilization has caused a  submergence of the individual into the group or class. Man is fast  ceasing to be the unit of human society. Self-governing groups are  becoming the new units. This is true of all classes of men, the employer  as well as the employee. The true justification for the American  anti-monopoly statutes, including the Sherman anti-trust law, lies not  so much in the realm of economics as in that of morals. With the  submergence of the individual, whether he be capitalist or wage-earner,  into a group, there has followed the dissipation of moral  responsibility. A mass morality has been substituted for individual  morality, and unfortunately, group morality generally intensifies the  vices more than the virtues of man.    Possibly, the greatest result of the mechanical age is this spirit of  organization.    Its merits are manifold and do not require statement; but they have  blinded us to the demerits of excessive organization.    We are now beginning to see--slowly, but surely--that a faculty of  organization which, as such, submerged the spirit of individualism, is  not an unmixed good.    Indeed, the moral lesson of the tragedy of Germany is the demoralizing  influence of organization carried to the _n_th power. No nation was ever  more highly organized than this modern State. Physically, intellectually  and spiritually it had become a highly developed machine. Its dominating  mechanical spirit so submerged the individual that, in 1914, the paradox  was observed of an enlightened nation that was seemingly destitute of a  conscience.    What was true of Germany, however, was true--although in lesser  degree--of all civilized nations. In all of them, the individual had  been submerged in group formations, and the effect upon the character of  man has been destructive of his nobler self.    This may explain the paradox of so-called \"progress.\" It may be likened  to a great wheel, which, from the increasing domination of mechanical  forces, developed an ever-accelerating speed, until, by centrifugal  action, it went off its bearings in 1914 and caused an unprecedented  catastrophe. As man slowly pulls himself out of that gigantic wreck and  recovers consciousness, he begins to realize that speed is not  necessarily progress.    Of all this, the nineteenth century, in its exultant pride in its  conquest of the invisible forces, was almost blind. It not only accepted  progress as an unmistakable fact--mistaking, however, acceleration and  facilitation for progress--but in its mad folly believed in an immutable  law of progress which, working with the blind forces of machinery, would  propel man forward.    A few men, however, standing on the mountain ranges of human  observation, saw the future more clearly than did the mass. Emerson,  Carlyle, Ruskin, Samuel Butler, and Max Nordau, in the nineteenth  century, and, in our time, Ferrero, all pointed out the inevitable  dangers of the excessive mechanization of human society. The prophecies  were unhappily as little heeded as those of Cassandra.    One can see the tragedy of the time, as a few saw it, in comparing the  first _Locksley Hall_ of Alfred Tennyson, written in 1827, with its  abiding faith in the \"increasing purpose of the ages\" and its roseate  prophecies of the golden age, when the \"war-drum would throb no longer  and the battle flags be furled in the Parliament of Man and the  Federation of the World,\" and the later _Locksley Hall_, written sixty  years later, when the great spiritual poet of our time gave utterance to  the dark pessimism which flooded his soul:      \"Gone the cry of 'Forward, Forward,' lost within a growing gloom;    Lost, or only heard in silence from the silence of a tomb.      Half the marvels of my morning, triumphs over time and space,    Staled by frequence, shrunk by usage, into commonest commonplace!      Evolution ever climbing after some ideal good,    And Reversion ever dragging Evolution in the mud.      Is it well that while we range with Science, glorying in the Time,    City children soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime?\"    Am I unduly pessimistic? I fear that this is the case with most men who,  like Dante, have crossed their fiftieth year and find themselves in a  \"dark and"]]]
