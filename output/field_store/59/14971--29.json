[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#2)"],[1,"at  that moment a big blue car trundled into view around the bend of the  road. The rear wheels struck a slide of sand and dust, and skidded; a  girl cried out; then the big machine gathered out of the cloud of dust,  and came toward Andy with a crackling like musketry, and it was plain  that it would leap through Martindale and away into the country beyond  at a bound. Andy could see now that it was a roadster, low-hung,  ponderous, to keep the road.    Pat Gregg was leaving the saloon; he was on his horse, but he sat the  saddle slanting, and his head was turned to give the farewell word to  several figures who bulged through the door of the saloon. For that  reason, as well as because of the fumes in his brain, he did not hear  the coming of the automobile. His friends from the saloon yelled a  warning, but he evidently thought it some jest, as he waved his hand  with a grin of appreciation. The big car was coming, rocking with its  speed; it was too late now to stop that flying mass of metal.    But the driver made the effort. His brakes shrieked, and still the car  shot on with scarcely abated speed, for the wheels could secure no  purchase in the thin sand of the roadway. Andy's heart stood still in  sympathy as he saw the face of the driver whiten and grow tense. Charles  Merchant, the son of rich John Merchant, was behind the wheel. Drunken  Pat Gregg had taken the warning at last. He turned in the saddle and  drove home his spurs, but even that had been too late had not Charles  Merchant taken the big chance. At the risk of overturning the machine he  veered it sharply to the left. It hung for a moment on two wheels. Andy  could count a dozen heartbeats while the plunging car edged around the  horse and shoved between Pat and the wall of the house--inches on either  side. Yet it must have taken not more than the split part of a second.    There was a shout of applause from the saloon; Pat Gregg sat his horse,  mouth open, his face pale, and then the heavy car rolled past the  blacksmith shop. Andy, breathing freely and cold to his finger tips, saw  young Charlie Merchant relax to a flickering smile as the girl beside  him caught his arm and spoke to him.    And then Andy saw her for the first time.    In the brief instant as the machine moved by, he printed the picture to  be seen again when she was gone. What was the hair? Red bronze, and  fiery where the sun caught at it, and the eyes were gray, or blue, or a  gray-green. But colors did not matter. It was all in her smile and the  turning of her eyes, which were very wide open. She spoke, and it was in  the sound of her voice. \"Wait!\" shouted Andy Lanning as he made a step  toward them. But the car went on, rocking over the bumps and the exhaust  roaring. Andy became aware that his shout had been only a dry whisper.  Besides, what would he say if they did stop?    And then the girl turned sharply about and looked back, not at the horse  they had so nearly struck, but at Andy standing in the door of his shop.  He felt sure that she would remember his face; her smile had gone out  while she stared, and now she turned her head suddenly to the front.  Once more the sun flashed on her hair; then the machine disappeared. In  a moment even the roar of the engine was lost, but it came back again,  flung in echoes from some hillside.    Not until all was silent, and the boys from the saloon were shaking  hands with Pat and laughing at him, did Andy turn back into the  blacksmith shop. He sat down on the anvil with his heart beating, and  began to recall the picture. Yes, it was all in the smile and the glint  of the eyes. And something else--how should he say it?--of the light  shining through her.    He stood up presently, closed the shop, and went home. Afterward his  uncle came in a fierce humor, slamming the door. He found Andy sitting  in front of the table staring down at his hands.    \"Buck Heath has been talkin' about you,\" said Jasper.    Andy raised his head. \"Look at 'em!\" he said as he spread out his hands.  \"I been scrubbin' 'em with sand soap for half an hour, and the oil and  the iron dust won't come out.\"    Uncle Jasper, who had a quiet voice and gentle manners, now stood rigid.  \"I wisht to God that some iron dust would work its way into your  soul,\" he said.    \"What are you talking about?\"    \"Nothin' you could understand; you need a mother to explain things to  you.\"    The other got up, white about the mouth. \"I think I do,\" said Andy.  \"I'm sick inside.\"    \"Where's supper?\" demanded Jasper.    Andy sat down again, and began to consider his hands once more. \"There's  something wrong--something dirty about this life.\"    \"Is there?\" Uncle Jasper leaned across the table, and once again the old  ghost of a hope was flickering behind his eyes. \"Who's been talkin'  to you?\"    He thought of the grinning men of the saloon; the hidden words. Somebody  might have gone out and insulted Andy to his face for the first time.  There had been plenty of insults in the past two years, since Andy could  pretend to manhood, but none that might not be overlooked. \"Who's been  talkin' to you?\" repeated Uncle Jasper. \"Confound that Buck Heath! He's  the cause of all the trouble!\"    \"Buck Heath! Who's he? Oh, I remember. What's he got to do with the  rotten life we lead here, Uncle Jas?\"    \"So?\" said the old man slowly. \"He ain't nothin'?\"    \"Bah!\" remarked Andy. \"You want me to go out and fight him? I won't. I  got no love for fighting. Makes me sort of sickish.\"    \"Heaven above!\" the older man invoked. \"Ain't you got shame? My blood in  you, too!\"    \"Don't talk like that,\" said Andy with a certain amount of reserve which  was not natural to him. \"You bother me. I want a little silence and a  chance to think things out. There's something wrong in the way I've  been living.\"    \"You're the last to find it out.\"    \"If you keep this up I'm going to take a walk so I can have quiet.\"    \"You'll sit there, son, till I'm through with you. Now, Andrew, these  years I've been savin' up for this moment when I was sure that--\"    To his unutterable astonishment Andy rose and stepped between him and  the door. \"Uncle Jas,\" he said, \"mostly I got a lot of respect for you  and what you think. Tonight I don't care what you or anybody else has to  say. Just one thing matters. I feel I've been living in the dirt. I'm  going out and see what's wrong. Good night.\"          CHAPTER 3      Uncle Jas was completely bowled over. Over against the wall as the door  closed he was saying to himself: \"What's happened? What's happened?\" As  far as he could make out his nephew retained very little fear of the  authority of Jasper Lanning.    One thing became clear to the old man. There had to be a decision  between his nephew and some full-grown man, otherwise Andy was very apt  to grow up into a sneaking coward. And in the matter of a contest Jasper  could not imagine a better trial horse than Buck Heath. For Buck was  known to be violent with his hands, but he was not likely to draw his  gun, and, more than this, he might even be bluffed down without making a  show of a fight. Uncle Jasper left his house supperless, and struck down  the street until he came to the saloon.    He found Buck Heath warming to his work, resting both elbows on the bar.  Bill Dozier was with him, Bill who was the black sheep in the fine old  Dozier family. His brother, Hal Dozier, was by many odds the most  respected and the most feared man in the region, but of all the good  Dozier qualities Bill inherited only their fighting capacity. He fought;  he loved trouble; and for that reason, and not because he needed the  money, he was now acting as a deputy sheriff. He was jesting with Buck  Heath in a rather superior manner, half contemptuous, half amused by  Buck's alcoholic swaggerings. And Buck was just sober enough to  perceive that he was being held lightly. He hated Dozier for that  treatment, but he feared him too much to take open offense. It was at  this opportune moment that old man Lanning, apparently half out of  breath, touched Buck on the elbow.    As Buck turned with a surly \"What the darnation?\" the other whispered:  \"Be on your way, Buck. Get out of town, and get out of trouble. My boy  hears you been talkin' about him, and he allows as how he'll get you.  He's out for you now.\"    The fumes cleared sufficiently from Buck Heath's mind to allow him to  remember that Jasper Lanning's boy was no other than the milk-blooded  Andy. He told Jasper to lead his boy on. There was a reception committee  waiting for him there in the person of one Buck Heath.    \"Don't be a fool, Buck,\" said Jasper, glancing over his shoulder. \"Don't  you know that Andy's a crazy, man-killin' fool when he gets started? And  he's out for blood now. You just slide out of town and come back when  his blood's cooled down.\"    Buck Heath took another drink from the bottle in his pocket, and then  regarded Jasper moodily. \"Partner,\" he declared gloomily, putting his  hand on the shoulder of Jasper, \"maybe Andy's a man-eater, but I'm a  regular Andy-eater, and here's the place where I go and get my feed.  Lemme loose!\"    He kicked open the door of the saloon. \"Where is he?\" demanded the  roaring Andy-eater. Less savagely, he went on: \"I'm lookin' for  my meat!\"    Jasper Lanning and Bill Dozier exchanged glances of understanding.  \"Partly drunk, but mostly yaller,\" observed Bill Dozier. \"Soon as the  air cools him off outside he'll mount his hoss and get on his way. But,  say, is your boy really out for his scalp?\" \"Looks that way,\" declared  Jasper with tolerable gravity.    \"I didn't know he was that kind,\" said Bill Dozier. And Jasper flushed,  for the imputation was clear. They went together to the window and  looked out.    It appeared that Bill Dozier was right. After standing in the middle of  the street in the twilight for a moment, Buck Heath turned and went  straight for his horse. A low murmur passed around "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909"],[0,"Nightmare Abbey (#2)"],[1," the domestics, whom Mr  Glowry always chose by one of two criterions,--a long face, or a  dismal name. His butler was Raven; his steward was Crow; his valet was  Skellet. Mr Glowry maintained that the valet was of French extraction,  and that his name was Squelette. His grooms were Mattocks and Graves.  On one occasion, being in want of a footman, he received a letter  from a person signing himself Diggory Deathshead, and lost no time in  securing this acquisition; but on Diggory's arrival, Mr Glowry was  horror-struck by the sight of a round ruddy face, and a pair of  laughing eyes. Deathshead was always grinning,--not a ghastly smile,  but the grin of a comic mask; and disturbed the echoes of the hall  with so much unhallowed laughter, that Mr Glowry gave him his  discharge. Diggory, however, had staid long enough to make conquests  of all the old gentleman's maids, and left him a flourishing colony of  young Deathsheads to join chorus with the owls, that had before been  the exclusive choristers of Nightmare Abbey.    The main body of the building was divided into rooms of state,  spacious apartments for feasting, and numerous bed-rooms for visitors,  who, however, were few and far between.    Family interests compelled Mr Glowry to receive occasional visits from  Mr and Mrs Hilary, who paid them from the same motive; and, as the  lively gentleman on these occasions found few conductors for his  exuberant gaiety, he became like a double-charged electric jar, which  often exploded in some burst of outrageous merriment to the signal  discomposure of Mr Glowry's nerves.    Another occasional visitor, much more to Mr Glowry's taste, was Mr  Flosky,[1] a very lachrymose and morbid gentleman, of some note in  the literary world, but in his own estimation of much more merit than  name. The part of his character which recommended him to Mr Glowry  was his very fine sense of the grim and the tearful. No one could  relate a dismal story with so many minutiae of supererogatory  wretchedness. No one could call up a _raw-head and bloody-bones_ with  so many adjuncts and circumstances of ghastliness. Mystery was his  mental element. He lived in the midst of that visionary world in which  nothing is but what is not. He dreamed with his eyes open, and saw  ghosts dancing round him at noontide. He had been in his youth  an enthusiast for liberty, and had hailed the dawn of the French  Revolution as the promise of a day that was to banish war and slavery,  and every form of vice and misery, from the face of the earth. Because  all this was not done, he deduced that nothing was done; and from this  deduction, according to his system of logic, he drew a conclusion  that worse than nothing was done; that the overthrow of the feudal  fortresses of tyranny and superstition was the greatest calamity that  had ever befallen mankind; and that their only hope now was to rake  the rubbish together, and rebuild it without any of those loopholes  by which the light had originally crept in. To qualify himself for a  coadjutor in this laudable task, he plunged into the central  opacity of Kantian metaphysics, and lay _perdu_ several years in  transcendental darkness, till the common daylight of common sense  became intolerable to his eyes. He called the sun an _ignis fatuus_;  and exhorted all who would listen to his friendly voice, which were  about as many as called 'God save King Richard,' to shelter themselves  from its delusive radiance in the obscure haunt of Old Philosophy.  This word Old had great charms for him. The good old times were always  on his lips; meaning the days when polemic theology was in its prime,  and rival prelates beat the drum ecclesiastic with Herculean vigour,  till the one wound up his series of syllogisms with the very orthodox  conclusion of roasting the other.    But the dearest friend of Mr Glowry, and his most welcome guest,  was Mr Toobad, the Manichaean Millenarian. The twelfth verse of the  twelfth chapter of Revelations was always in his mouth: 'Woe to the  inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come among  you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short  time.' He maintained that the supreme dominion of the world was, for  wise purposes, given over for a while to the Evil Principle; and that  this precise period of time, commonly called the enlightened age, was  the point of his plenitude of power. He used to add that by and by he  would be cast down, and a high and happy order of things succeed; but  he never omitted the saving clause, 'Not in our time'; which last  words were always echoed in doleful response by the sympathetic Mr  Glowry.    Another and very frequent visitor, was the Reverend Mr Larynx, the  vicar of Claydyke, a village about ten miles distant;--a good-natured  accommodating divine, who was always most obligingly ready to take a  dinner and a bed at the house of any country gentleman in distress  for a companion. Nothing came amiss to him,--a game at billiards, at  chess, at draughts, at backgammon, at piquet, or at all-fours in  a _tete-a-tete_,--or any game on the cards, round, square, or  triangular, in a party of any number exceeding two. He would even  dance among friends, rather than that a lady, even if she were on the  wrong side of thirty, should sit still for want of a partner. For a  ride, a walk, or a sail, in the morning,--a song after dinner, a ghost  story after supper,--a bottle of port with the squire, or a cup of  green tea with his lady,--for all or any of these, or for any thing  else that was agreeable to any one else, consistently with the dye of  his coat, the Reverend Mr Larynx was at all times equally ready. When  at Nightmare Abbey, he would condole with Mr Glowry,--drink Madeira  with Scythrop,--crack jokes with Mr Hilary,--hand Mrs Hilary to the  piano, take charge of her fan and gloves, and turn over her music with  surprising dexterity,--quote Revelations with Mr Toobad,--and lament  the good old times of feudal darkness with the transcendental Mr  Flosky.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER II      Shortly after the disastrous termination of Scythrop's passion for  Miss Emily Girouette, Mr Glowry found himself, much against his will,  involved in a lawsuit, which compelled him to dance attendance on the  High Court of Chancery. Scythrop was left alone at Nightmare Abbey. He  was a burnt child, and dreaded the fire of female eyes. He wandered  about the ample pile, or along the garden-terrace, with 'his  cogitative faculties immersed in cogibundity of cogitation.' The  terrace terminated at the south-western tower, which, as we have said,  was ruinous and full of owls. Here would Scythrop take his evening  seat, on a fallen fragment of mossy stone, with his back resting  against the ruined wall,--a thick canopy of ivy, with an owl in it,  over his head,--and the Sorrows of Werter in his hand. He had some  taste for romance reading before he went to the university, where, we  must confess, in justice to his college, he was cured of the love of  reading in all its shapes; and the cure would have been radical, if  disappointment in love, and total solitude, had not conspired to bring  on a relapse. He began to devour romances and German tragedies, and,  by the recommendation of Mr Flosky, to pore over ponderous tomes of  transcendental philosophy, which reconciled him to the labour of  studying them by their mystical jargon and necromantic imagery. In  the congenial solitude of Nightmare Abbey, the distempered ideas of  metaphysical romance and romantic metaphysics had ample time and space  to germinate into a fertile crop of chimeras, which rapidly shot up  into vigorous and abundant vegetation.    He now became troubled with the _passion for reforming the world_.[2]  He built many castles in the air, and peopled them with secret  tribunals, and bands of illuminati, who were always the imaginary  instruments of his projected regeneration of the human species. As he  intended to institute a perfect republic, he invested himself with  absolute sovereignty over these mystical dispensers of liberty. He  slept with Horrid Mysteries under his pillow, and dreamed of venerable  eleutherarchs and ghastly confederates holding midnight conventions in  subterranean caves. He passed whole mornings in his study, immersed  in gloomy reverie, stalking about the room in his nightcap, which  he pulled over his eyes like a cowl, and folding his striped calico  dressing-gown about him like the mantle of a conspirator.    'Action,' thus he soliloquised, 'is the result of opinion, and to  new-model opinion would be to new-model society. Knowledge is power;  it is in the hands of a few, who employ it to mislead the many, for  their own selfish purposes of aggrandisement and appropriation. What  if it were in the hands of a few who should employ it to lead the  many? What if it were universal, and the multitude were enlightened?  No. The many must be always in leading-strings; but let them have wise  and honest conductors. A few to think, and many to act; that is the  only basis of perfect society. So thought the ancient philosophers:  they had their esoterical and exoterical doctrines. So thinks the  sublime Kant, who delivers his oracles in language which none but  the initiated can comprehend. Such were the views of those secret  associations of illuminati, which were the terror of superstition and  tyranny, and which, carefully selecting wisdom and genius from the  great wilderness of society, as the bee selects honey from the flowers  of the thorn and the nettle, bound all human excellence in a chain,  which, if it had not been prematurely broken, would have commanded  opinion, and regenerated the world.'    Scythrop proceeded to meditate on the practicability of reviving a  confederation of regenerators. To get a clear view of his own ideas,  and to feel the pulse of the wisdom and genius of the age, he "]]]
