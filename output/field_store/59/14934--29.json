Uniformity of spelling is a strictly modern  accomplishment, a hampering innovation. \"A square roofe without Dormans,  with two Lucoms on each side,\" means, I think, without dormer windows, and  with luthern windows. Another church paid a bill for the meeting-house roof  and the \"Suppolidge.\" They had \"turritts\" and \"turetts\" and \"turits\" and  \"turyts\" and \"feriats\" and \"tyrryts\" and \"toryttes\" and \"turiotts\" and  \"chyrits,\" which were one and the same thing; and one church had orders  for \"juyces and rayles and nayles and bymes and tymber and gaybels and a  pulpyt, and three payr of stayrs,\" in its meeting-house,--a liberal supply  of the now fashionable _y_'s. We read of \"pinakles\" and \"pyks\" and  \"shuthers\" and \"scaffills\" and \"bimes\" and \"lynters\" and \"bathyns\" and  \"chymbers\" and \"bellfers;\" and often in one entry the same word will be  spelt in three or four different ways. Here is a portion of a contract in  the records of the Roxbury church: \"Sayd John is to fence in the Buring  Plas with a Fesy ston wall, sefighiattly don for Strenk and workmanship  as also to mark a Doball gatt 6 or 8 fote wid and to hing it.\"  _Sefighiattly_ is \"sufficiently;\" but who can translate \"Fesy\"? can it  mean \"facy\" or faced smoothly?    The church-raising was always a great event in the town. Each citizen was  forced by law to take part in or contribute to \"raring the Meeting hows.\"  In early days nails were scarce,--so scarce that unprincipled persons set  fire to any buildings which chanced to be temporarily empty, for the sake  of obtaining the nails from the ruins; so each male inhabitant supplied  to the new church a certain \"amount of nayles.\" Not only were logs, and  lumber, and the use of horses' and men's labor given, but a contribution  was also levied for the inevitable barrel of rum and its unintoxicating  accompaniments. \"Rhum and Cacks\" are frequent entries in the account books  of early churches. No wonder that accidents were frequent, and that men  fell from the scaffolding and were killed, as at the raising of the  Dunstable meeting-house. When the Medford people built their second  meeting-house, they provided for the workmen and bystanders, five barrels  of rum, one barrel of good brown sugar, a box of fine lemons, and two  loaves of sugar. As a natural consequence, two thirds of the frame fell,  and many were injured. In Northampton, in 1738, ten gallons of rum were  bought for L8 \"to raise the meeting-house\"--and the village doctor got \"L3  for setting his bone Jonathan Strong, and L3 10s. for setting Ebenezer  Burt's thy\" which had somehow through the rum or the raising, both gotten  broken. Sometimes, as in Pittsfield in 1671, the sum of four shillings was  raised on every acre of land in the town, and three shillings a day were  paid to every man who came early to work, while one shilling a day was  apportioned to each worker for his rum and sugar. At last no liquor was  allowed to the workmen until after the day's work was over, and thus fatal  accidents were prevented.    The earliest meeting-houses had oiled paper in the windows to admit the  light. A Pilgrim colonist wrote to an English friend about to emigrate,  \"Bring oiled paper for your windows.\" Higginson, however, writing in 1629,  asks for \"glasse for windowes.\" When glass was used it was not set in the  windows as now. We find frequent entries of \"glasse and nayles for it,\" and  in Newbury, in 1665, the church ordered that the \"Glasse in the windows  be ... look't to if any should happen to be loosed with winde to be nailed  close again.\" The glass was in lozenge-shaped panes, set in lead in the  form of two long narrow sashes opening in the middle from top to bottom,  and it was many years before oblong or square panes came into common use.    These early churches were destitute of shade, for the trees in the  immediate vicinity were always cut down on account of dread of the fierce  fires which swept often through the forests and overwhelmed and destroyed  the towns. The heat and blazing light in summer were as hard to bear in  these unscreened meeting-houses as was the cold in winter.      \"Old house of Puritanic wood,    Through whose unpainted windows streamed,    On seats as primitive and rude    As Jacob's pillow when he dreamed,    The white and undiluted day.\"    We have all heard the theory advanced that it is impossible there should be  any true religious feeling, any sense of sanctity, in a garish and bright  light,--\"the white and undiluted day,\"--but I think no one can doubt that  to the Puritans these seething, glaring, pine-smelling hothouses were truly  God's dwelling-place, though there was no \"dim, religious light\" within.    Curtains and window-blinds were unknown, and the sunlight streamed in with  unobstructed and unbroken rays. Heavy shutters for protection were often  used, but to close them at time of service would have been to plunge  the church into utter darkness. Permission was sometimes given, as in  Haverhill, to \"sett up a shed outside of the window to keep out the heat of  the sun there,\"--a very roundabout way to accomplish a very simple end. As  years passed on, trees sprang up and grew apace, and too often the churches  became overhung and heavily shadowed by dense, sombre spruce, cedar, and  fir trees. A New England parson was preaching in a neighboring church which  was thus gloomily surrounded. He gave out as his text, \"Why do the wicked  live?\" and as he peered in the dim light at his manuscript, he exclaimed  abruptly, \"I hope they will live long enough to cut down this great  hemlock-tree back of the pulpit window.\" Another minister, Dr. Storrs,  having struggled to read his sermon in an ill-lighted, gloomy church, said  he would never speak in that building again while it was so overshadowed  with trees. A few years later he was invited to preach to the same  congregation; but when he approached the church, and saw the great  umbrageous tree still standing, he rode away, and left the people  sermonless in their darkness. The chill of these sunless, unheated  buildings in winter can well be imagined.    Strange and grotesque decorations did the outside of the earliest  meeting-houses bear,--grinning wolves' heads nailed under the windows and  by the side of the door, while splashes of blood, which had dripped  from the severed neck, reddened the logs beneath. The wolf, for his  destructiveness, was much more dreaded by the settlers than the bear,  which did not so frequently attack the flocks. Bears were plentiful enough.  The history of Roxbury states that in 1725, in one week in September,  twenty bears were killed within two miles of Boston. This bear story  requires unlimited faith in Puritan probity, and confidence in Puritan  records to credit it, but believe it, ye who can, as I do! In Salem and in  Ipswich, in 1640, any man who brought a living wolf to the meeting-house  was paid fifteen shillings by the town; if the wolf were dead, ten  shillings. In 1664, if the wolf-killer wished to obtain the reward, he was  ordered to bring the wolf's head and \"nayle it to the meeting-house and  give notis thereof.\" In Hampton, the inhabitants were ordered to \"nayle the  same to a little red oake tree at northeast end of the meeting-house.\" One  man in Newbury, in 1665, killed seven wolves, and was paid the reward  for so doing. This was a great number, for the wary wolf was not easily  destroyed either by musket or wolf-hook. In 1723 wolves were so abundant  in Ipswich that parents would not suffer their children to go to and from  church and school without the attendance of some grown person. As late as  1746 wolves made sad havoc in Woodbury, Connecticut; and a reward of five  dollars for each wolf's head was offered by law in that township in 1853.    In 1718 the last public reward was paid in Salem for a wolf's head, but  so late as the year 1779 the howls of wolves were heard every night in  Newbury, though trophies of shrivelled wolves' heads no longer graced the  walls of the meeting-house.    All kinds of notices and orders and regulations and \"bills\" were posted on  the meeting-house, often on the door, where they would greet the eye of  all who entered: prohibitions from selling guns and powder to the Indians,  notices of town meetings, intentions of marriage, copies of the laws  against Sabbath-breaking, messages from the Quakers, warnings of \"vandoos\"  and sales, lists of the town officers, and sometimes scandalous and  insulting libels, and libels in verse, which is worse, for our forefathers  dearly loved to rhyme on all occasions. On the meeting-house green stood  those Puritanical instruments of punishment, the stocks, whipping-post,  pillory, and cage; and on lecture days the stocks and pillory were  often occupied by wicked or careless colonists, or those everlasting  pillory-replenishers, the Quakers. It is one of the unintentionally comic  features of absurd colonial laws and punishments in which the early legal  records so delightfully abound, that the first man who was sentenced to and  occupied the stocks in Boston was the carpenter who made them. He was thus  fitly punished for his extortionate charge to the town for the lumber  he used in their manufacture. This was rather better than \"making the  punishment fit the crime,\" since the Boston magistrates managed to force  the criminal to furnish his own punishment. In Shrewsbury, also, the  unhappy man who first tested the wearisome capacity and endured the public  mortication of the town's stocks was the man who made them. He \"builded  better than he knew.\" Pillories were used as a means of punishment until  a comparatively recent date,--in Salem until the year 1801, and in Boston  till 1803.    Great horse-blocks, rows of stepping-stones, or hewn logs further graced  the meeting-house green; and occasionally one fine horse-block, such as the  Concord women proudly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8675"],[0,"Welsh Fairy-Tales and Other Stories (#2)"],[1," of the valley,  where they buried her in a ditch. That night, when the miser heard of  her death, he dropped down dead on the spot.    As the lad was going home the queen appeared to him, and told him to be  at the ring the following day at noon.        VI.    Next day all the fairies came with the pole and mirror, each carrying  a harebell in her left-hand, and a blue cup of burning perfume in her  right, and they formed up as before, the lad walking beside the queen.  They marched round and repeated the old words, when the queen stopped  before the mirror, and said:    \"What do you see?\"      \"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,    It is an old plate-cupboard that I see.\"    A second time they went round, and the question, was repeated.      \"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,    The back is turned to me.\"    A third time was the ceremony fulfilled, and the lad answered      \"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,    A spring-door is open to me.\"    \"Buy that plate-cupboard at the miser's sale,\" said the queen, and she  and her companions disappeared as before.        VII.    Upon the day of the sale all the things were brought out in the road,  and the plate-cupboard was put up, the lad recognising it and bidding up  for it till it was sold to him. When he had paid for it he took it  home in a cart, and when he got in and examined it, he found the secret  drawer behind was full of gold. The following week the house and land,  thirty acres, was put up for sale, and the lad bought both, and married  the miser's niece, and they lived happily till they died.          THE CRAIG-Y-DON BLACKSMITH.    Once upon a time an old blacksmith lived in an old forge at Craig-y-don,  and he used to drink a great deal too much beer.    One night he was coming home from an alehouse very tipsy, and as he  got near a small stream a lot of little men suddenly sprang up from the  rocks, and one of them, who seemed to be older than the rest, came up to  him, and said,    \"If you don't alter your ways of living you'll die soon; but if you  behave better and become a better man you'll find it will be to your  benefit,\" and they all disappeared as quickly as they had come.    The old blacksmith thought a good deal about what the fairies had told  him, and he left off drinking, and became a sober, steady man.    One day, a few months after meeting the little people, a strange man  brought a horse to be shod. Nobody knew either the horse or the man.    The old blacksmith tied the horse to a hole in the lip of a cauldron  (used for the purpose of cooling his hot iron) that he had built in some  masonry.    When he had tied the horse up he went to shoe the off hind-leg, but  directly he touched the horse the spirited animal started back with a  bound, and dragged the cauldron from the masonry, and then it broke the  halter and ran away out of the forge, and was never seen again: neither  the horse nor its master.    When the old blacksmith came to pull down the masonry to rebuild it, he  found three brass kettles full of money.          OLD GWILYM.    Old Gwilym Evans started off one fine morning to walk across the Eagle  Hills to a distant town, bent upon buying some cheese. On his way, in a  lonely part of the hills, he found a golden guinea, which he quickly put  into his pocket.    When he got to the town, instead of buying his provisions, he went  into an alehouse, and sat drinking and singing with some sweet-voiced  quarrymen until dark, when he thought it was time to go home. Whilst he  was drinking, an old woman with a basket came in, and sat beside him,  but she left before him. After the parting glass he got up and reeled  through the town, quite forgetting to buy his cheese; and as he got  amongst the hills they seemed to dance up and down before him, and he  seemed to be walking on air. When he got near the lonely spot where he  had found the money he heard some sweet music, and a number of fairies  crossed his path and began dancing all round him, and then as he looked  up he saw some brightly-lighted houses before him on the hill; and  he scratched his head, for he never remembered having seen houses  thereabouts before. And as he was thinking, and watching the fairies,  one came and begged him to come into the house and sit down.    So he followed her in, and found the house was all gold inside it, and  brightly lighted, and the fairies were dancing and singing, and they  brought him anything he wanted for supper, and then they put him to bed.    Gwilym slept heavily, and when he awoke turned round, for he felt very  cold, and his body seemed covered with prickles; so he sat up and rubbed  his eyes, and found that he was quite naked and lying in a bunch of  gorse.    When he found himself in this plight he hurried home, and told his wife,  and she was very angry with him for spending all the money and bringing  no cheese home, and then he told her his adventures.    \"Oh, you bad man!\" she said, \"the fairies gave you money and you spent  it wrongly, so they were sure to take their revenge.\"          THE BABY-FARMER.    Old Kaddy was a baby-farmer, and one day she went to the woods to gather  sticks for her fire, and whilst she was gathering the sticks she found a  piece of gold, and took it home; but she never told anyone she had found  the money, for she always pretended to be very poor.    But though she was so poor, she used to dress two of her children in  fine clothes; but the others, whom she did not like, she kept in the  filthiest rags.    One day a man knocked at her door, and asked to see the children.    He sat down in her little room, and she went and brought the ragged  little boy and girl, saying she was very poor, and couldn't afford to  dress them better; for she had been careful to hide the well-dressed  little boy and girl in a cockloft.    After the stranger had gone she went to the cockloft to look for her  well-dressed favourites, but they had disappeared, and they were never  seen afterwards, for they were turned into fairies.          THE OLD MAN AND THE FAIRIES.    Many years ago the Welsh mountains were full of fairies. People used  to go by moonlight to see them dancing, for they knew where they would  dance by seeing green rings in the grass.    There was an old man living in those days who used to frequent the  fairs that were held across the mountains. One day he was crossing the  mountains to a fair, and when he got to a lonely valley he sat down, for  he was tired, and he dropped off to sleep, and his bag fell down by his  side. When he was sound asleep the fairies came and carried him off,  bag and all, and took him under the earth, and when he awoke he found  himself in a great palace of gold, full of fairies dancing and singing.  And they took him and showed him everything, the splendid gold room and  gardens, and they kept dancing round him until he fell asleep.    When he was asleep they carried him back to the same spot where they  had found him, and when he awoke he thought he had been dreaming, so  he looked for his bag, and got hold of it, but he could hardly lift it.  When he opened it he found it was nearly filled with gold.    He managed to pick it up, and turning round, he went home.    When he got home, his wife Kaddy said: \"What's to do, why haven't you  been to the fair?\"    \"I've got something here,\" he said, and showed his wife the gold.    \"Why, where did you get that?\"    But he wouldn't tell her. Since she was curious, like all women, she  kept worrying him all night--for he'd put the money in a box under the  bed--so he told her about the fairies.    Next morning, when he awoke, he thought he'd go to the fair and buy a  lot of things, and he went to the box to get some of the gold, but found  it full of cockle-shells.          TOMMY PRITCHARD.    Tommy Pritchard was going to school one day, and on his way he thought  he heard somebody singing on the other side of a stone wall by the road,  so he climbed up and looked over, and there underneath a stone he saw a  sixpence, so he took it.    Every morning after that, when he went to school, he used to look in the  same place, and he always found a sixpence.    His father noticed he was always spending money in the sweet-shop, so  he began to think Tommy was stealing from somebody, and one day he asked  him where he got the money. Tommy wouldn't tell at first, but his father  threatened to beat him, so he told him where he got his sixpences.    Next morning he went to look in the same place for his sixpence, and  he found nothing but a cockle-shell. And he never saw anything but a  cockle-shell there afterwards.          KADDY'S LUCK.    There was a tall young woman whom the fairies used to visit, coming  through the keyhole at night. She could hear them dancing and singing in  her room, but in the morning they used to go the way they had come, only  they always left her some money.    When she got married she chose a tall husband like herself, and they had  a fine big child.    One night they went to a fair, and they got to one side to hear the  fairies; for some people could tell when the fairies were coming, for  they made a noise like the wind. Whilst they were waiting she told her  husband how the fairies used to leave her money at night.    When they got home they found their baby all right, and went to bed. But  next morning the young mother found her child had been changed in the  night, and there was a very little baby in the cradle. And the child  never grew big, for the fairies had changed her child for spite.          THE STORY OF GELERT.
