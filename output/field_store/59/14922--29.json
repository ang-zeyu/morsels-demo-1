And the man replied--    'There ain't a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It's a bargain, if ever  there was one, and I'm more'n 'arf sorry I let it go at the price; but  we can't resist the lydies, can we, sir?' and he winked at father and  went away.    Then the carpet was put down in the nursery, and sure enough there  wasn't a hole in it anywhere.    As the last fold was unrolled something hard and loud-sounding bumped  out of it and trundled along the nursery floor. All the children  scrambled for it, and Cyril got it. He took it to the gas. It was shaped  like an egg, very yellow and shiny, half-transparent, and it had an odd  sort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways. It  was as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showed  through the stone.    'I MAY keep it, mayn't I, mother?' Cyril asked.    And of course mother said no; they must take it back to the man who had  brought the carpet, because she had only paid for a carpet, and not for  a stone egg with a fiery yolk to it.    So she told them where the shop was, and it was in the Kentish Town  Road, not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate. It was  a poky little shop, and the man was arranging furniture outside on the  pavement very cunningly, so that the more broken parts should show as  little as possible. And directly he saw the children he knew them again,  and he began at once, without giving them a chance to speak.    'No you don't' he cried loudly; 'I ain't a-goin' to take back no  carpets, so don't you make no bloomin' errer. A bargain's a bargain, and  the carpet's puffik throughout.'    'We don't want you to take it back,' said Cyril; 'but we found something  in it.'    'It must have got into it up at your place, then,' said the man, with  indignant promptness, 'for there ain't nothing in nothing as I sell.  It's all as clean as a whistle.'    'I never said it wasn't CLEAN,' said Cyril, 'but--'    'Oh, if it's MOTHS,' said the man, 'that's easy cured with borax. But I  expect it was only an odd one. I tell you the carpet's good through and  through. It hadn't got no moths when it left my 'ands--not so much as an  hegg.'    'But that's just it,' interrupted Jane; 'there WAS so much as an egg.'    The man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot.    'Clear out, I say!' he shouted, 'or I'll call for the police. A nice  thing for customers to 'ear you a-coming 'ere a-charging me with finding  things in goods what I sells. 'Ere, be off, afore I sends you off with a  flea in your ears. Hi! constable--'    The children fled, and they think, and their father thinks, that they  couldn't have done anything else. Mother has her own opinion.    But father said they might keep the egg.    'The man certainly didn't know the egg was there when he brought the  carpet,' said he, 'any more than your mother did, and we've as much  right to it as he had.'    So the egg was put on the mantelpiece, where it quite brightened up the  dingy nursery. The nursery was dingy, because it was a basement room,  and its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made of  clinkers facing the windows. Nothing grew in the rockery except London  pride and snails.    The room had been described in the house agent's list as a 'convenient  breakfast-room in basement,' and in the daytime it was rather dark. This  did not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight, but then  it was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable, and used to  come out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where their  homes were, and try to make friends with the children. At least, I  suppose that was what they wanted, but the children never would.    On the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre, and  the children were not happy, because the Prossers next door had lots of  fireworks and they had none.    They were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden.    'No more playing with fire, thank you,' was father's answer, when they  asked him.    When the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the fire  in the nursery.    'I'm beastly bored,' said Robert.    'Let's talk about the Psammead,' said Anthea, who generally tried to  give the conversation a cheerful turn.    'What's the good of TALKING?' said Cyril. 'What I want is for something  to happen. It's awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in the  evenings. There's simply nothing to do when you've got through your  homers.'    Jane finished the last of her home-lessons and shut the book with a  bang.    'We've got the pleasure of memory,' said she. 'Just think of last  holidays.'    Last holidays, indeed, offered something to think of--for they had  been spent in the country at a white house between a sand-pit and a  gravel-pit, and things had happened. The children had found a Psammead,  or sand-fairy, and it had let them have anything they wished for--just  exactly anything, with no bother about its not being really for their  good, or anything like that. And if you want to know what kind of things  they wished for, and how their wishes turned out you can read it all in  a book called Five Children and It (It was the Psammead). If you've not  read it, perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the baby  brother, who was called the Lamb, because the first thing he ever said  was 'Baa!' and that the other children were not particularly handsome,  nor were they extra clever, nor extraordinarily good. But they were not  bad sorts on the whole; in fact, they were rather like you.    'I don't want to think about the pleasures of memory,' said Cyril; 'I  want some more things to happen.'    'We're very much luckier than any one else, as it is,' said Jane. 'Why,  no one else ever found a Psammead. We ought to be grateful.'    'Why shouldn't we GO ON being, though?' Cyril asked--'lucky, I mean, not  grateful. Why's it all got to stop?'    'Perhaps something will happen,' said Anthea, comfortably. 'Do you know,  sometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to.'    'It's like that in history,' said Jane: 'some kings are full of  interesting things, and others--nothing ever happens to them, except  their being born and crowned and buried, and sometimes not that.'    'I think Panther's right,' said Cyril: 'I think we are the sort of  people things do happen to. I have a sort of feeling things would happen  right enough if we could only give them a shove. It just wants something  to start it. That's all.'    'I wish they taught magic at school,' Jane sighed. 'I believe if we  could do a little magic it might make something happen.'    'I wonder how you begin?' Robert looked round the room, but he got no  ideas from the faded green curtains, or the drab Venetian blinds, or  the worn brown oil-cloth on the floor. Even the new carpet suggested  nothing, though its pattern was a very wonderful one, and always seemed  as though it were just going to make you think of something.    'I could begin right enough,' said Anthea; 'I've read lots about it. But  I believe it's wrong in the Bible.'    'It's only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt other  people. I don't see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody,  and we don't want to hurt anybody; and what's more, we jolly well  couldn't if we tried. Let's get the Ingoldsby Legends. There's a thing  about Abra-cadabra there,' said Cyril, yawning. 'We may as well play at  magic. Let's be Knights Templars. They were awfully gone on magic. They  used to work spells or something with a goat and a goose. Father says  so.'    'Well, that's all right,' said Robert, unkindly; 'you can play the goat  right enough, and Jane knows how to be a goose.'    'I'll get Ingoldsby,' said Anthea, hastily. 'You turn up the hearthrug.'    So they traced strange figures on the linoleum, where the hearthrug had  kept it clean. They traced them with chalk that Robert had nicked  from the top of the mathematical master's desk at school. You know, of  course, that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk, but it is not  wrong to take a broken piece, so long as you only take one. (I do not  know the reason of this rule, nor who made it.) And they chanted all the  gloomiest songs they could think of. And, of course, nothing happened.  So then Anthea said, 'I'm sure a magic fire ought to be made of  sweet-smelling wood, and have magic gums and essences and things in it.'    'I don't know any sweet-smelling wood, except cedar,' said Robert; 'but  I've got some ends of cedar-wood lead pencil.'    So they burned the ends of lead pencil. And still nothing happened.    'Let's burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds,' said  Anthea.    And they did. It certainly smelt very strong. And they burned lumps  of camphor out of the big chest. It was very bright, and made a horrid  black smoke, which looked very magical. But still nothing happened. Then  they got some clean tea-cloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen,  and waved them over the magic chalk-tracings, and sang 'The Hymn of the  Moravian Nuns at Bethlehem', which is very impressive. And still nothing  happened. So they waved more and more wildly, and Robert's tea-cloth  caught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece, and it fell  into the fender and rolled under the grate.    'Oh, crikey!' said more than one voice.    And every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under the  grate, and there lay the egg, glowing in a nest of hot ashes.    'It's not smashed, anyhow,' said Robert, and he put his hand under the  grate and picked up the egg. But the egg was much hotter than any one  would have believed it could possibly get in such a short time, and  Robert had to drop it with a cry of 'Bother!' It fell on the top "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#2)"],[1,"in another city' of  China when his attention was suddenly drawn to the Svastika and other  Buddhist symbols which the architect had skilfully used in decorating  the building. His face brightened as he said to his companion: \"I did  not know that Christians had any appreciation of beauty in their  religion.\"    These incidents reveal aspects of the alchemy of the soul by which the  real devotee of one religion perceives values which are dear to him in  another religion. The good which he has attained in his old religion  enables him to appropriate the better in the new religion. A converted  monk, explaining his acceptance of Christianity, said: \"I found in Jesus  Christ the great Bodhisattva, my Saviour, who brings to fruition the  aspirations awakened in me by Buddhism.\"    Just as it has been said that they do not know England who know England  only, so it may be said with equal truth that they do not know  Christianity who know it and no other faith. There are many in China  like the old lady at the temple, who have found in Buddhism something of  that spiritual satisfaction and stimulus which true Christianity  affords, in fuller measure. The recognition of such religious values by  the student or the missionary furnishes a sound foundation for the  building of a truer spirituality among such devotees.    As will be seen in what follows, religion in China is at first sight a  mixed affair. From the standpoint of cruder household superstitions an  average Chinese family may be regarded as Taoists; the principles by  which its members seek to guide their lives individually and socially  may be called Confucian; their attitude of worship and their hopes for  the future make them Buddhists. The student would not be far afield when  he credits the religious aspirations of the Chinese today to Buddhism,  regarding Confucianism as furnishing the ethical system to which they  submit and Taoism as responsible for many superstitious practices. But  the Buddhism found in China differs radically from that of Southern  Asia, as will be made clear by the following sketch of its introduction  into the Flowery Kingdom and its subsequent history.          II      THE ENTRANCE OF BUDDHISM INTO CHINA    Buddhism was not an indigenous religion of China. Its founder was  Gautama of India in the sixth century B.C. Some centuries later it found  its way into China by way of central Asia. There is a tradition that as  early as 142 B.C. Chang Ch'ien, an ambassador of the Chinese emperor, Wu  Ti, visited the countries of central Asia, where he first learned about  the new religion which was making such headway and reported concerning  it to his master. A few years later the generals of Wu Ti captured a  gold image of the Buddha which the emperor set up in his palace and  worshiped, but he took no further steps.    According to Chinese historians Buddhism was officially recognized in  China about 67 A.D. A few years before that date, the emperor, Ming-Ti,  saw in a dream a large golden image with a halo hovering above his  palace. His advisers, some of whom were no doubt already favorable to  the new religion, interpreted the image of the dream to be that of  Buddha, the great sage of India, who was inviting his adhesion.  Following their advice the emperor sent an embassy to study into  Buddhism. It brought back two Indian monks and a quantity of Buddhist  classics. These were carried on a white horse and so the monastery which  the emperor built for the monks and those who came after them was called  the White Horse Monastery. Its tablet is said to have survived to this  day.    This dream story is worth repeating because it goes to show that  Buddhism was not only known at an early date, but was favored at the  court of China. In fact, the same history which relates the dream  contains the biography of an official who became an adherent of Buddhism  a few years before the dream took place. This is not at all surprising,  because an acquaintance with Buddhism was the inevitable concomitant of  the military campaigning, the many embassies and the wide-ranging trade  of those centuries. But the introduction of Buddhism into China was  especially promoted by reason of the current policy of the Chinese  government of moving conquered populations in countries west of China  into China proper, The vanquished peoples brought their own religion  along with them. At one time what is now the province of Shansi was  populated in this way by the Hsiung-nu, many of whom were Buddhists.    The introduction and spread of Buddhism were hastened by the decline of  Confucianism and Taoism. The Han dynasty (206 B. C.-221 A. D.)  established a government founded on Confucianism. It reproduced the  classics destroyed in the previous dynasty and encouraged their study;  it established the state worship of Confucius; it based its laws and  regulations upon the ideals and principles advocated by Confucius. The  great increase of wealth and power under this dynasty led to a gradual  deterioration in the character of the rulers and officials. The rigid  Confucian regulations became burdensome to the people who ceased to  respect their leaders. Confucianism lost its hold as the complete  solution of the problems of life. At the same time Taoism had become a  veritable jumble of meaningless and superstitious rites which served to  support a horde of ignorant, selfish priests. The high religious ideals  of the earlier Taoist mystics were abandoned for a search after the  elixir of life during fruitless journeys to the isles of the Immortals  which were supposed to be in the Eastern Sea.    At this juncture there arose in North China a sect of men called the  Purists who advocated a return from the vagaries of Taoism and the  irritating rules of Confucianism to the simple life practised by the  Taoist mystics. When these thoughtful and earnest minded men came into  contact with Buddhism they were captivated by it. It had all they were  claiming for Taoist mysticism and more. They devoted their literary  ability and religious fervor to the spreading of the new religion and  its success was in no small measure due to their efforts. As a result of  this early association the tenets of the two religions seemed so much  alike that various emperors called assemblies of Buddhists and Taoists  with the intention of effecting a union of the two religions into one.  If the emperor was under the influence of Buddhism he tried to force all  Taoists to become Buddhists. If he was favorable to Taoism he tried to  make all Buddhists become Taoists.    But such mandates were as unsuccessful as other similar schemes have  been. In the third century A. D. after the Han dynasty had ended, China  was broken up into several small kingdoms which contended for supremacy,  so that for about four hundred years the whole country was in a state of  disunion. One of the strong dynasties of this period, the Northern Wei  (386-535 A. D.), was distinctly loyal to Buddhism. During its  continuance Buddhism prospered greatly. Although Chinese were not  permitted to become monks until 335 A. D., still Buddhism made rapid  advances and in the fourth century, when that restriction was removed,  about nine-tenths of the people of northwestern China had become  Buddhists. Since then Buddhism has been an established factor in Chinese  life.          III      THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BUDDHISM AS THE PREDOMINATING RELIGION OF CHINA    Even the historical influences noted above do not account entirely for  the spread of Buddhism in China. In order to understand this and the  place which Buddhism occupies, we need to review briefly the different  forms which religion takes in China and to note how Buddhism has related  itself to them.    _1. The World of Invisible Spirits_    The Chinese believe _in_ a surrounding-world of spirits, whose  origin is exceedingly various. They touch life at every point. There are  spirits which are guardians of the soil, tree spirits, mountain demons,  fire gods, the spirits of animals, of mountains, of rivers, seas and  stars, of the heavenly bodies and of many forms of active life. These  spirits to the Chinese mind, of today are a projection, a sort of  spiritual counterpart, of the many sided interests, practical or  otherwise, of the groups and communities by whom they are worshipped.  There are other spirits which mirror the ideals of the groups by which  they are worshipped. Some of them may have been incarnated in the lives  of great leaders. There are spirits which are mere animations,  occasional spirits, associated with objects crossing the interests of  men, but not constant enough to attain a definite, independent life as  spiritual beings. Thus surrounding the average Chinese peasant there is  a densely populated spirit world affecting in all kinds of ways his,  daily existence. This other world is the background which must be kept  in mind by one who would understand or attempt to guide Chinese  religious experience. It is the basis on which all organized forms of  religious activity are built. The nearest of these to his heart is the  proper regard for his ancestors.    _2. The Universal Sense_ of _Ancestor Control_    The ancestral control of family life occupies so large and important a  place in Chinese thought and practice that ancestor worship has been  called the original religion of the Chinese. It is certain that the  earliest Confucian records recognize ancestor worship; but doubtless it  antedated them, growing up out of the general religious consciousness of  the people. The discussion of that origin in detail cannot be taken up  here. It may be followed in the literature noted in the appendix or in  the volume of this series entitled \"Present-Day Confucianism.\" Ancestor  worship is active today, however, because the Chinese as a people  believe that these ancestors control in a very real way the good or evil  fortunes of their descendants,"]]]
