In geography there is still much to be desired; and a careful  and undeviating use of the backboard, for four hours daily during the  next three years, is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of  that dignified DEPORTMENT AND CARRIAGE, so requisite for every young  lady of FASHION.    In the principles of religion and morality, Miss Sedley will be found  worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of  THE GREAT LEXICOGRAPHER, and the patronage of the admirable Mrs.  Chapone.  In leaving the Mall, Miss Amelia carries with her the hearts  of her companions, and the affectionate regards of her mistress, who  has the honour to subscribe herself,    Madam, Your most obliged humble servant, BARBARA PINKERTON    P.S.--Miss Sharp accompanies Miss Sedley.  It is particularly requested  that Miss Sharp's stay in Russell Square may not exceed ten days.  The  family of distinction with whom she is engaged, desire to avail  themselves of her services as soon as possible.      This letter completed, Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name,  and Miss Sedley's, in the fly-leaf of a Johnson's Dictionary--the  interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on  their departure from the Mall.  On the cover was inserted a copy of  \"Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton's school,  at the Mall; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson.\" In fact, the  Lexicographer's name was always on the lips of this majestic woman, and  a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her  fortune.    Being commanded by her elder sister to get \"the Dictionary\" from the  cupboard, Miss Jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the  receptacle in question.  When Miss Pinkerton had finished the  inscription in the first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air,  handed her the second.    \"For whom is this, Miss Jemima?\" said Miss Pinkerton, with awful  coldness.    \"For Becky Sharp,\" answered Jemima, trembling very much, and blushing  over her withered face and neck, as she turned her back on her sister.  \"For Becky Sharp: she's going too.\"    \"MISS JEMIMA!\" exclaimed Miss Pinkerton, in the largest capitals. \"Are  you in your senses? Replace the Dixonary in the closet, and never  venture to take such a liberty in future.\"    \"Well, sister, it's only two-and-ninepence, and poor Becky will be  miserable if she don't get one.\"    \"Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,\" said Miss Pinkerton. And so  venturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly  flurried and nervous.    Miss Sedley's papa was a merchant in London, and a man of some wealth;  whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil, for whom Miss Pinkerton had  done, as she thought, quite enough, without conferring upon her at  parting the high honour of the Dixonary.    Although schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more nor less  than churchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person  departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone  cutter carves over his bones; who IS a good Christian, a good parent,  child, wife, or husband; who actually DOES leave a disconsolate family  to mourn his loss; so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs  every now and then that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises  bestowed by the disinterested instructor. Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a  young lady of this singular species; and deserved not only all that  Miss Pinkerton said in her praise, but had many charming qualities  which that pompous old Minerva of a woman could not see, from the  differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself.    For she could not only sing like a lark, or a Mrs. Billington, and  dance like Hillisberg or Parisot; and embroider beautifully; and spell  as well as a Dixonary itself; but she had such a kindly, smiling,  tender, gentle, generous heart of her own, as won the love of everybody  who came near her, from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the  scullery, and the one-eyed tart-woman's daughter, who was permitted to  vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the Mall.  She had  twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies.  Even envious Miss Briggs never spoke ill of her; high and mighty Miss  Saltire (Lord Dexter's granddaughter) allowed that her figure was  genteel; and as for Miss Swartz, the rich woolly-haired mulatto from  St. Kitt's, on the day Amelia went away, she was in such a passion of  tears that they were obliged to send for Dr. Floss, and half tipsify  her with salvolatile.  Miss Pinkerton's attachment was, as may be  supposed from the high position and eminent virtues of that lady, calm  and dignified; but Miss Jemima had already whimpered several times at  the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear of her sister, would  have gone off in downright hysterics, like the heiress (who paid  double) of St. Kitt's.  Such luxury of grief, however, is only allowed  to parlour-boarders. Honest Jemima had all the bills, and the washing,  and the mending, and the puddings, and the plate and crockery, and the  servants to superintend.  But why speak about her?  It is probable that  we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end of time, and  that when the great filigree iron gates are once closed on her, she and  her awful sister will never issue therefrom into this little world of  history.    But as we are to see a great deal of Amelia, there is no harm in  saying, at the outset of our acquaintance, that she was a dear little  creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which  (and the latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort,  that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and  good-natured a person.  As she is not a heroine, there is no need to  describe her person; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short  than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a  heroine; but her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the  freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the  brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled  with tears, and that was a great deal too often; for the silly thing  would cry over a dead canary-bird; or over a mouse, that the cat haply  had seized upon; or over the end of a novel, were it ever so stupid;  and as for saying an unkind word to her, were any persons hard-hearted  enough to do so--why, so much the worse for them.  Even Miss Pinkerton,  that austere and godlike woman, ceased scolding her after the first  time, and though she no more comprehended sensibility than she did  Algebra, gave all masters and teachers particular orders to treat Miss  Sedley with the utmost gentleness, as harsh treatment was injurious to  her.    So that when the day of departure came, between her two customs of  laughing and crying, Miss Sedley was greatly puzzled how to act. She  was glad to go home, and yet most woefully sad at leaving school.  For  three days before, little Laura Martin, the orphan, followed her about  like a little dog.  She had to make and receive at least fourteen  presents--to make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week:  \"Send my letters under cover to my grandpapa, the Earl of Dexter,\" said  Miss Saltire (who, by the way, was rather shabby).  \"Never mind the  postage, but write every day, you dear darling,\" said the impetuous and  woolly-headed, but generous and affectionate Miss Swartz; and the  orphan little Laura Martin (who was just in round-hand), took her  friend's hand and said, looking up in her face wistfully, \"Amelia, when  I write to you I shall call you Mamma.\" All which details, I have no  doubt, JONES, who reads this book at his Club, will pronounce to be  excessively foolish, trivial, twaddling, and ultra-sentimental.  Yes; I  can see Jones at this minute (rather flushed with his joint of mutton  and half pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scoring under the  words \"foolish, twaddling,\" &c., and adding to them his own remark of  \"QUITE TRUE.\" Well, he is a lofty man of genius, and admires the great  and heroic in life and novels; and so had better take warning and go  elsewhere.    Well, then.  The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, and  bonnet-boxes of Miss Sedley having been arranged by Mr. Sambo in the  carriage, together with a very small and weather-beaten old cow's-skin  trunk with Miss Sharp's card neatly nailed upon it, which was delivered  by Sambo with a grin, and packed by the coachman with a corresponding  sneer--the hour for parting came; and the grief of that moment was  considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton  addressed to her pupil.  Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to  philosophise, or that it armed her in any way with a calmness, the  result of argument; but it was intolerably dull, pompous, and tedious;  and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss  Sedley did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions  of private grief.  A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in  the drawing-room, as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents,  and these refreshments being partaken of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to  depart.    \"You'll go in and say good-by to Miss Pinkerton, Becky!\" said Miss  Jemima to a young lady of whom nobody took any notice, and who was  coming downstairs with her own bandbox.    \"I suppose I must,\" said Miss Sharp calmly, and much to the wonder of  Miss Jemima; and the latter having knocked at the door, and receiving  permission to come in, Miss Sharp advanced in a very unconcerned  manner, and said in French, and with a perfect accent, \"Mademoiselle,  je viens vous faire mes adieux.\"    Miss Pinkerton did not understand French; she only directed those who  did: but biting her lips and throwing up her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#2)"],[1," he was looking another way, and then began the real  difficulty of my picnic: how was the little tin tea-pot and an odd  delf cup to be carried? F---- objected to put them also in his pocket,  assuring me that I could make very good tea by putting my packet of the  fragrant leaves into the bushmen's kettle, and drinking it afterwards  out of one of their pannikins. He tried to bribe me to this latter piece  of simplicity by promising to wash the tin pannikin out for me first.  Now I was not dainty or over particular; I could not have enjoyed my New  Zealand life so thoroughly if I had been either; but I did not like the  idea of using the bushmen's tea equipage. In the first place, the tea  never tastes the same when made in their way, and allowed to boil for a  moment or two after the leaves have been thrown in, before the kettle is  taken off the fire; and in the next place, it is very difficult to  drink tea out of a pannikin; for it becomes so hot directly we put  the scalding liquid into it, that long after the tea is cool enough  to drink, the pannikin still continues too hot to touch. But I said so  pathetically, \"You know how wretched I am without my tea,\" that F----'s  heart relented, and he managed to stow away the little teapot and  the cup. That cup bore a charmed life. It accompanied me on all my  excursions, escaping unbroken; and is, I believe, in existence now,  spending its honoured old age in the recesses of a cupboard.    After the luncheon, the next question to be decided is, which of the  dogs are to join the expedition. Hector, of course; he is the master's  colley, and would no more look at a sheep, except in the way of  business, than he would fly. Rose, a little short-haired terrier, was  the most fascinating of dog companions, and I pleaded hard for her, as  she was an especial pet; though there were too many lambs belonging to  a summer lambing (in New Zealand the winter is the usual lambing season)  in the sheltered paddocks beneath the bush, to make it quite safe for  her to be one of the party. She would not kill or hurt a lamb on  any account, but she always appeared anxious to play with the little  creatures; and as her own spotless coat was as white as theirs, she  often managed to get quite close to a flock of sheep before they  perceived that she belonged to the dreaded race of dogs. When the timid  animals found out their mistake, a regular stampede used to ensue; and  it was not supposed to be good for the health of the old or young sheep  to hurry up the hill-sides in such wild fashion as that in which they  rushed away from Rose's attempts to intrude on their society. Nettle may  come, for he is but a tiny terrier, and so fond of his mistress that he  never strays a yard away from her horse's heels. Brisk, my beautiful,  stupid water-spaniel, is also allowed an outing. He is perfect to look  at, but not having had any educational advantages in his youth, is an  utter fool; amiable, indeed, but not the less a fool. Garibaldi, another  colley, is suffering a long penal sentence of being tied up to his  barrel, on account of divers unlawful chases after sheep which were  not wanted; and dear old Jip, though she pretends to be very anxious  to accompany us; is far too fat and too rheumatic to keep pace with our  long stretching gallop up the valley.    At last we were fairly off about eleven o'clock, and an hour's easy  canter, intersected by many \"flat-jumps,\" or rather \"water-jumps,\"  across the numerous creeks, brought unto the foot of the bush-clad  mountain. After that our pace became a very sober one, as the track  resembled a broken rocky staircase more than a bridle-path. But such as  it was, our sure-footed horses carried us safely up and down its  rugged steeps, without making a single false step. No mule can be more  sure-footed than a New Zealand horse. He will carry his rider anywhere,  if only that rider trusts entirely to him, nor attempts to guide him in  any way. During the last half-hour of our slow and cat-like climb,  we could hear the ring of the bushmen's axes, and the warning shouts  preceding the crashing fall of a Black Birch. Fallen logs and deep ruts  made by the sledges in their descent, added to the difficulties of the  track; and I was so faint-hearted as to entreat piteously, on more  than one occasion, when Helen paused and shook her head preparatory to  climbing over a barricade, to be \"taken off.\" But F---- had been used to  these dreadful roads for too many years to regard them in the same light  as I did, and would answer carelessly, \"Nonsense: you're as safe as if  you were sitting in an arm-chair.\" All I can say is, it might have been  so, but I did not feel at all like it.    However, the event proved him to have been right, and we reached the  clearing in safety. Here we dismounted, and led the horses to a place  where they could nibble some grass, and rest in the cool shade. The  saddles and bridles were soon removed, and halters improvised out of the  New Zealand flax, which can be turned to so many uses. Having provided  for the comfort of our faithful animals, our next step was to look for  the bushmen. The spot which we had reached was their temporary home in  the heart of the forest, but their work was being carried on elsewhere.  I could not have told from which side the regular ringing axe-strokes  proceeded, so confusing were the echoes from the cliffs around us;  but after a moment's silent pause F---- said, \"If we follow that track  (pointing to a slightly cleared passage among the trees) we shall  come upon them.\" So I kilted up my linsey skirt, and hung up my little  jacket, necessary for protection against the evening air, on a bough out  of the wekas' reach, whilst I followed F---- through tangled creepers,  \"over brake, over brier,\" towards the place from whence the noise of  falling trees proceeded. By the time we reached it, our scratched hands  and faces bore traces of the thorny undergrowth which had barred our  way; but all minor discomforts were forgotten in the picturesque beauty  of the spot. Around us lay the forest-kings, majestic still in their  overthrow, whilst substantial stacks of cut-up and split timber  witnessed to the skill and industry of the stalwart figures before us,  who reddened through their sunburn with surprise and shyness at seeing  a lady. They need not have been afraid of me, for I had long ago made  friends with them, and during the preceeding winter had established a  sort of night-school in my dining-room, for all the hands employed on  the station, and these two men had been amongst my most constant pupils.  One of them, a big Yorkshire-man, was very backward in his \"larning,\"  and though he plodded on diligently, never got beyond the simplest words  in the largest type. Small print puzzled him at once, and he had a habit  of standing or sitting with his back to me whilst repeating his lessons.  Nothing would induce him to face me. The moment it became his turn to  go on with the chapter out of the Bible, with which we commenced our  studies, that instant he turned his broad shoulders towards me, and I  could only, hear the faintest murmurs issuing from the depths of a great  beard. Remonstrance would have scared my shy pupil away, so I was fain  to put up with his own method of instruction.    But this is a digression, and I want to make you see with my eyes the  beautiful glimpses of distant country lying around the bold wooded  cliff on which we were standing. The ground fell away from our feet so  completely in some places, that we could see over the tops of the high  trees around us, whilst in others the landscape appeared framed in an  arch of quivering foliage. A noisy little creek chattered and babbled as  it hurried along to join its big brother down below, and kept a fringe  of exquisite ferns, which grew along its banks, brightly green by its  moisture. Each tree, if taken by itself, was more like an umbrella than  anything else to English eyes, for in these primitive forests, where  no kind pruning hand has ever touched them, they shoot up, straight and  branchless, into the free air above, where they spread a leafy crown out  to the sunbeams. Beneath the dense shade of these matted branches grew  a luxuriant shrubbery, whose every leaf was a marvel of delicate beauty,  and ferns found here a home such as they might seek elsewhere in vain.  Flowers were very rare, and I did not observe many berries, but these  conditions vary in different parts of the beautiful middle island.    That was a fair and fertile land stretching out before us, intersected  by the deep banks of the Rakaia, with here and there a tiny patch of  emerald green and a white dot, representing the house and English grass  paddock of a new settler. In the background the bush-covered mountains  rose ever higher and higher in bolder outline, till they shook off  their leafy clothing, and stood out in steep cliffs and scaurs from the  snow-clad glacier region of the mountain range running from north to  south, and forming the back bone of the island. I may perhaps make you  see the yellow, river-furrowed plains, and the great confusion of  rising ground behind them, but cannot make you see, still less feel, the  atmosphere around, quivering in a summer haze in the valley beneath, and  stirred to the faintest summer wind-sighs as it moved among the pines  and birches overhead. Its lightness was its most striking peculiarity.  You felt as if your lungs could never weary of inhaling deep breaths of  such an air. Warm without oppression, cool without a chill. I can find  nothing but paradoxes to describe it. As for fatigue, one's muscles  might get tired, and need rest, but the usual depression and weariness  attending over-exertion could not exist in such an atmosphere. One felt  like a happy child; pleased at nothing, content to exist where existence  was a pleasure.    You could not find more favourable"]]]
