[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#2)"],[1,"registered the question her lips  did not speak, while her eyes took in the house, the barn, the  out-buildings, the orchard--every spot dear to her childhood.    And then the silence of the countryside was torn by a sudden burst of  sound that made the very hills tremble.    For one full moment while the trio on the hillside kept their places,  breathless, expectant, a cloud of dust and smoke obscured the view.    During this moment Cherry became conscious of the dog that lay whining  at her feet. Bending low, she patted his sleek head. \"Yes, I know it's  terrible,\" she soothed. \"You don't like it. We don't either. But we all  must endure it for England's sake.\"    As if he understood, the dog nestled silently at her feet.    The smoke cleared. The girl sighed with relief. The bomb had fallen in  the orchard. A single apple tree, one of the early pippins, had been  uprooted. A slight loss. The tree was quite old.    And then with a shock it came to her that everything--the house, the  barn, the dovecotes,--all about the place was old, old and very dear.    Then again her lips parted in sudden fright, for a second silver spot,  larger than the first, had appeared against the sky. Watching its swift  descent, she grabbed at her painfully beating heart. At first it seemed  that it must fall upon the house. \"Alice is there,\" her reeling brain  registered the thought. Then came a sense of relief. The house would be  spared. Then it was to be the barn where two fine colts were housed that  would receive the full force of the blow.    \"No,\" she sighed. \"Farther up the hill.\"    The bomb fell not ten feet from a small square building. Like a tree,  uprooted by the blast, this tiny house leapt high in air, then  collapsing, crashed to earth. At the same instant dust and smoke  concealed all.    As if struck a blow from behind, the girl leapt forward, stood there  tense, motionless for a period of seconds, then disregarding the loyal  collie whining at her heels, went dashing down the hill.    The apparently insignificant building had once been a smoke-house.  Perhaps that had been fifty years before. When Cherry was a child it had  been converted into a playhouse. There, hours on end, she and her sister  Alice had played with their dolls and at keeping house. They, to be sure  had abandoned both dolls and playhouse long ago. But from time to time  other children had come to live on the Ramsey Farm. Both playhouse and  dolls had been theirs. At this moment two cute children, Tillie and  Peggy, from the London slums, were staying at the Ramsey Farm. This old  smoke-house was their favorite haunt. As Cherry sped down the hill  allowing herself not one glance at the brightening sky, she dared not  ask the question that haunted her terror-stricken mind. \"Oh, God!\" she  whispered, \"It can't be true!\"                                        _Chapter_ II                             Catbirds and Hawk      From the spot where Dave and Brand stood the ancient playhouse could not  be seen. That tragedy might have befallen some member of their household  they did not so much as dream. Enough that by some miracle the house and  barns had been spared and that the hated enemy plane, having delivered  its load, was now speeding away.    But not so fast. The speedy British Spitfire had made a broad circle and  was prepared to meet the enemy head on.    As Brand Ramsey stood stiffly at attention, watching every move of those  fighting planes, his fingers clenched and unclenched nervously. Not so  his American companion. Standing at ease, smiling a little, his lips  parted, he might have been at a tennis match.    How often, during his early days on an American farm this boy, Dave  Barnes, had watched a fight between two catbirds and a hawk. How  insignificant the catbirds had appeared, how terrifying, with curved  beak and needle-like claws, the hawk. And yet how often, quite  disheartened, the gray intruder had soared away. In the fight being  fought above them now he saw the battle of catbirds and hawk. Which  would win? His sympathies had ever been with the catbirds. It was so  now. And yet he whispered to himself, \"It's not my war.\"    His war or no, he followed every move of those birdlike things that  whirling, zooming, dipping, soaring, appeared at any moment ready to  crash head on and burst into flames.    Now the Spitfire was beneath the enemy, coming up. Now! Oh! Now! The boy  drew a deep breath. Now the Spitfire was on the Messerschmitt's tail.  \"Now!\" he breathed.    Once more a sharp exclamation escaped his lips, for banking sharply, the  enemy slid out of the trap. At that instant, with tail to the enemy, the  Tomahawk was doing a broad circle to re-enter the scrap.    \"Oh! Oh! Watch out!\" Brand, the English boy shouted, as if he could call  a warning to the pilot in the American plane. The Messerschmitt had  turned the tables and was at the Tomahawk's back. Brand wanted to stop  his ears from the rat--tat--tat that he knew must come. Instead, he  stood there mute, staring with all his might.    And then it came, a ripping, tearing burst of sound, as if the very sky  was being torn to shreds.    \"He--he got him!\" Brand's lips went white as the Tomahawk, after banking  so sharply it seemed to stand on its right wing, went into a spin.    Only then did the American boy realize to the full that this was a  battle, not a show affair that these were men and planes, not birds, and  that the brave fellow in that spinning airplane was apparently about to  be beaten to a pulp on the cruel earth of the hillside. Instinctively he  closed his eyes and began to count,--\"One--two--three.\" Thirty seconds,  he thought, then all will be over.    He had counted only to fifteen when a sharp cry--\"Hooray!\" sent his eyes  wide open again.    \"He--he came out of it!\" Brand exulted with a wild wave of his arms.    It was true. The apparently doomed pilot had somehow pulled his plane  out of that fateful spin. What was more, he was not leaving the field.  Instead, he was once again climbing rapidly.    \"Look!\" Brand exclaimed. \"That Messerschmitt has had enough! She's  climbing! She's afraid of that Tomahawk. Thinks she can outclimb him.  The Tomahawk's motor is not so good at dizzy heights. But, boy! How they  can climb! Half a mile a minute!\"    They were climbing now, all three planes. The enemy plane had the lead  by many hundreds of feet. First after her came the Spitfire. Then the  Tomahawk.    It was an all but perpendicular race, a glorious thing to see. Slowly,  surely, the game little Spitfire, seeming only a nighthawk at that  distance, closed in upon the enemy. Behind her, closing in faster,  faster, ever faster, was the Tomahawk.    \"See! What did I tell you!\" Brand's voice rose with enthusiasm. \"That  Tomahawk is a climber! You Americans should be proud of that ship!\"    \"I suppose we are.\" Dave scarcely heard. A born mathematician, he was  trying by some occult system to determine the outcome of this strange  race.    \"In twenty seconds,\" he pulled out a thin gold watch, \"the Tomahawk will  pass the Spitfire. Forty seconds more and--well--you'll see.\" His lips  trembled as his words trailed off.    Hardly had he finished speaking when the small planes were abreast.  Brand even imagined he saw the Tomahawk's pilot wave to the other as he  passed.    Forty tense seconds and then there came a ripping of the sky, longer,  more terrifying than any they had yet heard. Half below, and half on the  Messerschmitt's tail, the Tomahawk was finding sweet revenge.    \"That's enough. No ship can take that and keep on flying!\" the English  boy breathed. At the same instant the attacking Tomahawk slipped away in  a graceful spiral glide.    \"What a ship!\" the American boy breathed. \"It can take it, and dish it  out!\"    The Messerschmitt had had more than enough. Black bits of wreckage began  dropping from the mortally wounded plane. Among these were three larger  spots, darker than the rest. Presently above these three white mushrooms  blossomed against the sky. \"Parachutes!\" Brand exclaimed. \"They're  coming down! Land somewhere up the slope. Come on! We've got to get  them!\"    Gone from Dave's mind was the thought that this was not his war, as he  sped after his companion. Two facts were registered on his mind as he  raced ahead--a one-legged man using a crutch had stopped his plow-team  in the field and was racing toward the slope--a large collie dog was  scooting across a low meadow. The dog appeared intent upon joining the  one-legged man.                                       _Chapter_ III                              Dolls and Nazis      In the meantime, quite ignoring the battle in the sky, two streaks of  red and gold--Cherry the girl, and Flash the dog--had gone racing down  the slope. In her golden sweater and red plaid skirt the girl seemed  little more than a sprite. The collie might well have been her golden  shadow. That she was quite a real person she herself knew full well. Her  painfully beating heart told her that.    Even as she raced on, her eyes were searching the ruins that had once  been the playhouse of her childhood. They were looking for some trace of  red or blue calico,--shocking proof that her fears had been well founded  and that two small girls had been in the playhouse at the time the bomb  fell.    It was only after she had reached the top of the stile leading from the  field to the house that she caught a loud: \"Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo, Cherry!\"    One look, and she crumpled down on the stile steps to burst into a flood  of tears, tears of pure joy.    All gay in red and blue calico Tillie and Peggy stood in the farmhouse  doorway. A moment more and they had left the house to come racing toward  Cherry.    In the meantime the fighting planes had gone beyond the hill, quite out  of her sight. Soon she was hugging two tumble-haired young sprites to  her bosom, and exclaiming: \"Tillie! Peggy! You are safe! I was, Oh! "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#2)"],[1," it should be as you  say; I would crush them all at a blow. Then only should I feel really a  queen. But that is but a dream that can never be carried out.\"    \"Not in our time, madam. But perhaps it may come sooner than we expect;  and this long war, which has destroyed many great families and weakened  others, may greatly hasten its arrival. I presume until Warwick is ready  to move naught will be done, your Majesty?\"    \"That is not settled yet. Warwick spoke somewhat of causing a rising  in the north before he set sail, so that a portion at least of Edward's  power may be up there when we make our landing.\"    \"It would be a prudent step, madam. If we can but gain possession of  London, the matter would be half finished. The citizens are ever ready  to take sides with those whom they regard as likely to win, and just as  they shout at present 'Long live King Edward!' so would they shout 'Long  live King Henry!' did you enter the town.\"    \"This may perhaps change the thought that you have entertained, Sir  Thomas, of making your son a Knight of St. John.\"    \"I have not thought the matter over, madam. If there were quiet in the  land I should, were it not for my vow, be well content that he should  settle down in peace at my old hall; but if I see that there is still  trouble and bloodshed ahead, I would in any case far rather that he  should enter the Order, and spend his life in fighting the infidel than  in strife with Englishmen. My good friend, the Grand Prior of the Order  in England, has promised that he will take him as his page, and at  any rate in the House of St. John's he will pass his youth in security  whatsoever fate may befall me. The child himself already bids fair to  do honour to our name, and to become a worthy member of the Order. He is  fond of study, and under my daily tuition is making good progress in the  use of his weapons.\"    \"That is he,\" the prince said, speaking for the first time, \"It was but  yesterday in the great hall downstairs he stood up with blunted swords  against young Victor de Paulliac, who is nigh three years his senior. It  was amusing to see how the little knaves fought against each other;  and by my faith Gervaise held his own staunchly, in spite of Victor's  superior height and weight. If he join the Order, Sir Thomas, I warrant  me he will cleave many an infidel's skull, and will do honour to the  langue of England.\"    \"I hope so, prince,\" the knight said gravely. \"The Moslems ever gain in  power, and it may well be that the Knights of St. John will be hardly  pressed to hold their own. If the boy joins them it will be my wish that  he shall as early as possible repair to Rhodes. I do not wish him to  become one of the drones who live in sloth at their commanderies in  England, and take no part in the noble struggle of the Order with the  Moslem host, who have captured Constantinople and now threaten all  Europe. We were childless some years after our marriage, and Eleanor and  I vowed that were a son born to us he should join the Order of the White  Cross, and dedicate his life to the defence of Christian Europe against  the infidel. Our prayers for a son were granted, and Gervaise will enter  the Order as soon as his age will permit him. That is why I rejoice at  the grand prior's offer to take him as his page, for he will dwell in  the hospital safely until old enough to take the first steps towards  becoming a knight of the Order.\"    \"I would that I had been born the son of a baron like yourself,\" the  prince said earnestly, \"and that I were free to choose my own career.  Assuredly in that case I too would have joined the noble Order and  have spent my life in fighting in so grand a cause, free from all the  quarrels and disputes and enmities that rend England. Even should I some  day gain a throne, surely my lot is not to be envied. Yet, as I have  been born to the rank, I must try for it, and I trust to do so worthily  and bravely. But who can say what the end will be? Warwick has ever  been our foe, and though my royal mother may use him in order to free my  father, and place him on the throne, she must know well enough that he  but uses us for his own ends alone, and that he will ever stand beside  the throne and be the real ruler of England.\"    \"For a time, Edward,\" the queen broke in. \"We have shown that we can  wait, and now it seems that our great hope is likely to be fulfilled.  After that, the rest will be easy. There are other nobles, well nigh as  powerful as he, who look with jealousy upon the way in which he lords  it, and be assured that they will look with a still less friendly eye  upon him when he stands, as you say, beside the throne, once your father  is again seated there. We can afford to bide our time, and assuredly it  will not be long before a party is formed against Warwick. Until then  we must bear everything. Our interests are the same. If he is content  to remain a prop to the throne, and not to eclipse it, the memory of  the past will not stand between us, and I shall regard him as the weapon  that has beaten down the House of York and restored us to our own, and  shall give him my confidence and friendship. If, on the other hand,  he assumes too much, and tries to lord it over us, I shall seek other  support and gather a party which even he will be unable successfully to  withstand. I should have thought, Edward, that you would be even more  glad than I that this long time of weary waiting for action is over, and  that once again the banner of Lancaster will be spread to the winds.\"    \"I shall be that, mother. Rather would I meet death in the field than  live cooped up here, a pensioner of France. But I own that I should feel  more joy at the prospect if the people of England had declared in our  favour, instead of its being Warwick--whom you have always taught me to  fear and hate--who thus comes to offer to place my father again on the  throne, and whose goodwill towards us is simply the result of pique and  displeasure because he is no longer first in the favour of Edward. It  does not seem to me that a throne won by the aid of a traitor can be a  stable one.\"    \"You are a foolish boy,\" the queen said angrily. \"Do you not see that by  marrying Warwick's daughter you will attach him firmly to us?\"    \"Marriages do not count for much, mother. Another of Warwick's daughters  married Clarence, Edward's brother, and yet he purposes to dethrone  Edward.\"    The queen gave an angry gesture and said, \"You have my permission to  retire, Edward. I am in no mood to listen to auguries of evil at the  present moment.\"    The prince hesitated for a moment as if about to speak, but with an  effort controlled himself, and bowing deeply to his mother, left the  room.    \"Edward is in a perverse humour,\" the queen said in a tone of much  vexation to Sir Thomas Tresham, when Gervaise had left the room.  \"However, I know he will bear himself well when the hour of trial  comes.\"    \"That I can warrant he will, madam; he has a noble character, frank and  fearless, and yet thoughtful beyond his years. He will make, I believe,  a noble king, and may well gather round him all parties in the state.  But your Majesty must make excuses for his humour. Young people are  strong in their likes and dislikes. He has never heard you speak aught  but ill of Warwick, and he knows how much harm the Earl has done to your  House. The question of expediency does not weigh with the young as with  their elders. While you see how great are the benefits that will accrue  from an alliance with Warwick, and are ready to lay aside the hatred of  years and to forget the wrongs you have suffered, the young prince is  unable so quickly to forget that enmity against the Earl that he has  learnt from you.\"    \"You are right, Sir Thomas, and I cannot blame Edward that he is unable,  as I am, to forget the past. What steps would you advise that I myself  should take? Shall I remain passive here, or shall I do what I can to  rouse our partisans in England?\"    \"I should say the latter, madam. Of course it will not do to trust to  letters, for were one of these to fall into the wrong hands it might  cause the ruin of Warwick's expedition; but I should say that a cautious  message sent by word of mouth to some of our old adherents would be of  great use. I myself will, if your Majesty chooses to entrust me with the  mission, undertake to carry it out. I should take ship and land in the  west, and would travel in the guise of a simple country gentleman,  and call upon your adherents in all the western counties. It would be  needful first to make out a list of the nobles who have shown themselves  devoted to your cause, and I should bid these hold themselves and their  retainers in readiness to take the field suddenly. I should say no word  of Warwick, but merely hint that you will not land alone, but with a  powerful array, and that all the chances are in your favour.\"    \"But it would be a dangerous mission, Sir Thomas.\"    \"Not greatly so, madam. My own estates lie in Sussex, and there would be  but little chance of my recognition, save by your own adherents, who may  have seen me among the leaders of your troops in battle; and even that  is improbable. At present Edward deems himself so securely seated on  the throne that men can travel hither and thither through the country  without being questioned, and the Lancastrians live quietly with the  Yorkists. Unless I were so unfortunate as to meet a Yorkist noble who  knew that I was a banished man and one who had the honour of being in  your Majesty's confidence, I do not think that any danger could possibly  arise. What say you, wife?\"    \"I cannot think that there is no danger,\" Lady Tresham said; \"but even  so I would not say a word to hinder you from doing service to the cause.  I know of no one else who could perform the mission. You have left my  side to go into battle before now, and I cannot think that the"]]]
