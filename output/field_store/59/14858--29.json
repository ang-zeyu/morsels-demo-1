But he was deceived  by the specious nature of Scott's remark. Visions rose before his eyes  of sitting back in one of Scott's armchairs, watching a fag toasting  muffins, which he would eventually dispatch with languid enjoyment. So  he followed Scott to his study. The classical parallel to his situation  is the well-known case of the oysters. They, too, were eager for the  treat.    They had reached the study, and Pillingshot was about to fling himself,  with a sigh of relief, into the most comfortable chair, when Scott  unmasked his batteries.    'Oh, by the way,' he said, with a coolness which to Pillingshot  appeared simply brazen, 'I'm afraid my fag won't be here today. The  young crock's gone and got mumps, or the plague, or something. So would  you mind just lighting that stove? It'll be rather warm, but that won't  matter. There are some muffins in the cupboard. You might weigh in with  them. You'll find the toasting-fork on the wall somewhere. It's hanging  up. Got it? Good man. Fire away.'    And Scott collected five cushions, two chairs, and a tin of mixed  biscuits, and made himself comfortable. Pillingshot, with feelings too  deep for words (in the then limited state of his vocabulary), did as he  was requested. There was something remarkable about the way Scott could  always get people to do things for him. He seemed to take everything  for granted. If he had had occasion to hire an assassin to make away  with the German Emperor, he would have said, 'Oh, I say, you might run  over to Germany and kill the Kaiser, will you, there's a good chap?  Don't be long.' And he would have taken a seat and waited, without the  least doubt in his mind that the thing would be carried through as  desired.    Pillingshot had just finished toasting the muffins, when the door  opened, and Venables, of Merevale's, came in.    'I thought I heard you say something about tea this afternoon, Scott,'  said Venables. 'I just looked in on the chance. Good Heavens, man!  Fancy muffins at this time of year! Do you happen to know what the  thermometer is in the shade?'    'Take a seat,' said Scott. 'I attribute my entire success in life  to the fact that I never find it too hot to eat muffins. Do you  know Pillingshot? One of the hottest fieldsmen in the School.  At least, he was just now. He's probably cooled off since then.  Venables--Pillingshot, and _vice versa_. Buck up with the tea,  Pillingshot. What, ready? Good man. Now we might almost begin.'    'Beastly thing that accident of young Brown's, wasn't it?' said Scott.  'Chaps oughtn't to go slamming about like that with the field full of  fellows. I suppose he won't be right by next Saturday?'    'Not a chance. Why? Oh, yes, I forgot. He was to have scored for the  team at Windybury, wasn't he?'    'Who are you going to get now?'    Venables was captain of the St Austin's team. The match next Saturday  was at Windybury, on the latter's ground.    'I haven't settled,' said Venables. 'But it's easy to get somebody.  Scoring isn't one of those things which only one chap in a hundred  understands.'    Then Pillingshot had an idea--a great, luminous idea.    'May I score?' he asked, and waited trembling with apprehension lest  the request be refused.    'All right,' said Venables, 'I don't see any reason why you shouldn't.  We have to catch the 8.14 at the station. Don't you go missing it or  anything.'    'Rather _not_,' said Pillingshot. 'Not much.'              *          *          *          *         *    On Saturday morning, at exactly 9.15, Mr Mellish distributed the Livy  papers. When he arrived at Pillingshot's seat and found it empty, an  expression passed over his face like unto that of the baffled villain  in transpontine melodrama.    'Where is Pillingshot?' he demanded tragically. 'Where is he?'    'He's gone with the team to Windybury, sir,' said Parker, struggling to  conceal a large size in grins. 'He's going to score.'    'No,' said Mr Mellish sadly to himself, 'he _has_ scored.'          [2]    THE ODD TRICK      The attitude of Philip St H. Harrison, of Merevale's House, towards his  fellow-man was outwardly one of genial and even sympathetic toleration.  Did his form-master intimate that his conduct was not _his_ idea  of what Young England's conduct should be, P. St H. Harrison agreed  cheerfully with every word he said, warmly approved his intention of  laying the matter before the Headmaster, and accepted his punishment  with the air of a waiter booking an order for a chump chop and fried  potatoes. But the next day there would be a squeaking desk in the  form-room, just to show the master that he had not been forgotten. Or,  again, did the captain of his side at football speak rudely to him on  the subject of kicking the ball through in the scrum, Harrison would  smile gently, and at the earliest opportunity tread heavily on the  captain's toe. In short, he was a youth who made a practice of taking  very good care of himself. Yet he had his failures. The affair of  Graham's mackintosh was one of them, and it affords an excellent  example of the truth of the proverb that a cobbler should stick to his  last. Harrison's _forte_ was diplomacy. When he forsook the arts  of the diplomatist for those of the brigand, he naturally went wrong.  And the manner of these things was thus.    Tony Graham was a prefect in Merevale's, and part of his duties was to  look after the dormitory of which Harrison was one of the ornaments. It  was a dormitory that required a good deal of keeping in order. Such  choice spirits as Braithwaite of the Upper Fourth, and Mace, who was  rapidly driving the master of the Lower Fifth into a premature grave,  needed a firm hand. Indeed, they generally needed not only a firm hand,  but a firm hand grasping a serviceable walking-stick. Add to these  Harrison himself, and others of a similar calibre, and it will be seen  that Graham's post was no sinecure. It was Harrison's custom to throw  off his mask at night with his other garments, and appear in his true  character of an abandoned villain, willing to stick at nothing as long  as he could do it strictly incog. In this capacity he had come into  constant contact with Graham. Even in the dark it is occasionally  possible for a prefect to tell where a noise comes from. And if the  said prefect has been harassed six days in the week by a noise, and  locates it suddenly on the seventh, it is wont to be bad for the  producer and patentee of same.    And so it came about that Harrison, enjoying himself one night, after  the manner of his kind, was suddenly dropped upon with violence. He had  constructed an ingenious machine, consisting of a biscuit tin, some  pebbles, and some string. He put the pebbles in the tin, tied the  string to it, and placed it under a chest of drawers. Then he took the  other end of the string to bed with him, and settled down to make a  night of it. At first all went well. Repeated inquiries from Tony  failed to produce the author of the disturbance, and when finally the  questions ceased, and the prefect appeared to have given the matter up  as a bad job, P. St H. Harrison began to feel that under certain  circumstances life was worth living. It was while he was in this happy  frame of mind that the string, with which he had just produced a  triumphant rattle from beneath the chest of drawers, was seized, and  the next instant its owner was enjoying the warmest minute of a  chequered career. Tony, like Brer Rabbit, had laid low until he was  certain of the direction from which the sound proceeded. He had then  slipped out of bed, crawled across the floor in a snake-like manner  which would have done credit to a Red Indian, found the tin, and traced  the string to its owner. Harrison emerged from the encounter feeling  sore and unfit for any further recreation. This deed of the night left  its impression on Harrison. The account had to be squared somehow, and  in a few days his chance came. Merevale's were playing a 'friendly'  with the School House, and in default of anybody better, Harrison had  been pressed into service as umpire. This in itself had annoyed him.  Cricket was not in his line--he was not one of your flannelled  fools--and of all things in connection with the game he loathed  umpiring most.    When, however, Tony came on to bowl at his end, _vice_ Charteris,  who had been hit for three fours in an over by Scott, the School  slogger, he recognized that even umpiring had its advantages, and  resolved to make the most of the situation.    Scott had the bowling, and he lashed out at Tony's first ball in his  usual reckless style. There was an audible click, and what the sporting  papers call confident appeals came simultaneously from Welch,  Merevale's captain, who was keeping wicket, and Tony himself. Even  Scott seemed to know that his time had come. He moved a step or two  away from the wicket, but stopped before going farther to look at the  umpire, on the off-chance of a miracle happening to turn his decision  in the batsman's favour.    The miracle happened.    'Not out,' said Harrison.    'Awfully curious,' he added genially to Tony, 'how like a bat those  bits of grass sound! You have to be jolly smart to know where a noise  comes from, don't you!'    Tony grunted disgustedly, and walked back again to the beginning of his  run.    If ever, in the whole history of cricket, a man was out  leg-before-wicket, Scott was so out to Tony's second ball. It was  hardly worth appealing for such a certainty. Still, the formality had  to be gone through.    'How was _that_?' inquired Tony.    'Not out. It's an awful pity, don't you think, that they don't bring in  that new leg-before rule?'    'Seems to me,' said Tony bitterly, 'the old rule holds pretty good when  a man's leg's bang in front.'    'Rather. But you see the ball didn't pitch straight, and the rule  says--'    'Oh,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#2)"],[1," Allen took things very easily. He knew  his training was by no means all it should have been, and it was not  his game to take it out of himself with any firework business in the  trial heats. He would reserve that for the final. So he sparred three  gentle rounds with the Harrow sportsman, just doing sufficient to keep  the lead and obtain the verdict after the last round. He finished  without having turned a hair. He had only received one really hard  blow, and that had done no damage. After this came a long series of  fights. The heavy-weights shed their blood in gallons for name and  fame. The feather-weights gave excellent exhibitions of science, and  the light-weight pairs were fought off until there remained only the  final to be decided, Robinson, of St Paul's, against a Charterhouse  boxer.    In the middle-weights there were three competitors still in the  running, Allen, Tony, and a Felsted man. They drew lots, and the bye  fell to Tony, who put up an uninteresting three rounds with one of the  soldiers, neither fatiguing himself very much. Henderson, of Felsted,  proved a much tougher nut to crack than Allen's first opponent. He was  a rushing boxer, and in the first round had, if anything, the best of  it. In the last two, however, Allen gradually forged ahead, gaining  many points by his perfect style alone. He was declared the winner, but  he felt much more tired than he had done after his first fight.    By the time he was required again, however, he had had plenty of  breathing space. The final of the light-weights had been decided, and  Robinson, of St Paul's, after the custom of Paulines, had set the crown  upon his afternoon's work by fighting the Carthusian to a standstill in  the first round. There only remained now the finals of the heavies and  middles.    It was decided to take the latter first.    Tony had his former seconds, and Dawkins had come to his corner to see  him through the ordeal.    'The 'ole thing 'ere,' he kept repeating, 'is to keep goin' 'ard all  the time and wear 'im out. He's too quick for you to try any sparrin'  with.'    'Yes,' said Tony.    'The 'ole thing,' continued the expert, 'is to feint with your left and  'it with your right.' This was excellent in theory, no doubt, but Tony  felt that when he came to put it into practice Allen might have other  schemes on hand and bring them off first.    'Are you ready? Seconds out of the ring.... Time!'    'Go in, sir, 'ard,' whispered the red-haired man as Tony rose from his  place.    Allen came up looking pleased with matters in general. He gave Tony a  cousinly grin as they shook hands. Tony did not respond. He was feeling  serious, and wondering if he could bring off his knock-out before the  three rounds were over. He had his doubts.    The fight opened slowly. Both were cautious, for each knew the other's  powers. Suddenly, just as Tony was thinking of leading, Allen came in  like a flash. A straight left between the eyes, a right on the side of  the head, and a second left on the exact tip of the nose, and he was  out again, leaving Tony with a helpless feeling of impotence and  disgust.    Then followed more sparring. Tony could never get in exactly the right  position for a rush. Allen circled round him with an occasional feint.  Then he hit out with the left. Tony ducked. Again he hit, and again  Tony ducked, but this time the left stopped halfway, and his right  caught Tony on the cheek just as he swayed to one side. It staggered  him, and before he could recover himself, in darted Allen again with  another trio of blows, ducked a belated left counter, got in two  stinging hits on the ribs, and finished with a left drive which took  Tony clean off his feet and deposited him on the floor beside the  ropes.    'Silence, _please_,' said the referee, as a burst of applause  greeted this feat.    Tony was up again in a moment. He began to feel savage. He had expected  something like this, but that gave him no consolation. He made up his  mind that he really would rush this time, but just as he was coming in,  Allen came in instead. It seemed to Tony for the next half-minute that  his cousin's fists were never out of his face. He looked on the world  through a brown haze of boxing-glove. Occasionally his hand met  something solid which he took to be Allen, but this was seldom, and,  whenever it happened, it only seemed to bring him back again like a  boomerang. Just at the most exciting point, 'Time' was called.    The pessimist shook his head gloomily as he sponged Tony's face.    'You must lead if you want to 'it 'im,' said the garrulous man. 'You're  too slow. Go in at 'im, sir, wiv both 'ands, an' you'll be all right.  Won't 'e, Fred?'    'I said 'ow it 'ud be,' was the only reply Fred would vouchsafe.    Tony was half afraid the referee would give the fight against him  without another round, but to his joy 'Time' was duly called. He came  up to the scratch as game as ever, though his head was singing. He  meant to go in for all he was worth this round.    And go in he did. Allen had managed, in performing a complicated  manoeuvre, to place himself in a corner, and Tony rushed. He was sent  out again with a flush hit on the face. He rushed again, and again met  Allen's left. Then he got past, and in the confined space had it all  his own way. Science did not tell here. Strength was the thing that  scored, hard half-arm smashes, left and right, at face and body, and  the guard could look after itself.    Allen upper-cut him twice, but after that he was nowhere. Tony went in  with both hands. There was a prolonged rally, and it was not until  'Time' had been called that Allen was able to extricate himself. Tony's  blows had been mostly body blows, and very warm ones at that.    'That's right, sir,' was the comment of the red-headed second. 'Keep  'em both goin' hard, and you'll win yet. You 'ad 'im proper then.  'Adn't 'e, Fred?'    And even the pessimist was obliged to admit that Tony could fight, even  if he was not quick with his guard.    Allen took the ring slowly. His want of training had begun to tell on  him, and some of Tony's blows had landed in very tender spots. He knew  that he could win if his wind held out, but he had misgivings. The  gloves seemed to weigh down his hands. Tony opened the ball with a  tremendous rush. Allen stopped him neatly. There was an interval while  the two sparred for an opening. Then Allen feinted and dashed in. Tony  did not hit him once. It was the first round over again. Left right,  left right, and, finally, as had happened before, a tremendously hot  shot which sent him under the ropes. He got up, and again Allen darted  in. Tony met him with a straight left. A rapid exchange of blows, and  the end came. Allen lashed out with his left. Tony ducked sharply, and  brought his right across with every ounce of his weight behind it,  fairly on to the point of the jaw. The right cross-counter is  distinctly one of those things which it is more blessed to give than to  receive. Allen collapsed.    '... nine ... ten.'    The time-keeper closed his watch.    'Graham wins,' said the referee, 'look after that man there.'          [2]    THIEVES BREAK IN AND STEAL      It was always the custom for such Austinians as went up to represent  the School at the annual competition to stop the night in the town. It  was not, therefore, till just before breakfast on the following day  that Tony arrived back at his House. The boarding Houses at St Austin's  formed a fringe to the School grounds. The two largest were the School  House and Merevale's. Tony was at Merevale's. He was walking up from  the station with Welch, another member of Merevale's, who had been up  to Aldershot as a fencer, when, at the entrance to the School grounds,  he fell in with Robinson, his fag. Robinson was supposed by many  (including himself) to be a very warm man for the Junior Quarter, which  was a handicap race, especially as an injudicious Sports Committee had  given him ten yards' start on Simpson, whom he would have backed  himself to beat, even if the positions had been reversed. Being a wise  youth, however, and knowing that the best of runners may fail through  under-training, he had for the last week or so been going in for a  steady course of over-training, getting up in the small hours and going  for before-breakfast spins round the track on a glass of milk and a  piece of bread. Master R. Robinson was nothing if not thorough in  matters of this kind.    But today things of greater moment than the Sports occupied his mind.  He had news. He had great news. He was bursting with news, and he  hailed the approach of Tony and Welch with pleasure. With any other  leading light of the School he might have felt less at ease, but with  Tony it was different. When you have underdone a fellow's eggs and  overdone his toast and eaten the remainder for a term or two, you begin  to feel that mere social distinctions and differences of age no longer  form a barrier.    Besides, he had news which was absolutely fresh, news to which no one  could say pityingly: 'What! Have you only just heard _that_!'    'Hullo, Graham,' he said. 'Have you come back?' Tony admitted that he  had. 'Jolly good for getting the Middles.' (A telegram had, of course,  preceded Tony.) 'I say, Graham, do you know what's happened? There'll  be an awful row about it. Someone's been and broken into the Pav.'    'Rot! How do you know?'    'There's a pane taken clean out. I booked it in a second as I was going  past to the track.'    'Which room?'    'First Fifteen. The window facing away from the Houses.'    'That's rum,' said Welch. 'Wonder what a burglar wanted in the First  room. Isn't even a hair-brush there generally.'    Robinson's eyes dilated with honest pride. This was good. This was  better than he had looked for. Not only were they unaware of the  burglary, but they had not even an idea as to the recent event which  had made the"]]]
