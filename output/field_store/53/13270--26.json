This occurs, according  to the 2nd [diagram] of this [prop.] which says:--The intersection  of derived shadows when produced by the intersection of columnar  shadows caused by a single light does not produce a simple shadow.  And this is the corollary of the 1st [prop.] which says:--The  intersection of simple derived shadows never results in a deeper  shadow, because the deepest shadows all added together cannot be  darker than one by itself. Since, if many deepest shadows increased  in depth by their duplication, they could not be called the  _deepest_ shadows, but only part-shadows. But if such intersections  are illuminated by a second light placed between the eye and the  intersecting bodies, then those shadows would become compound  shadows and be uniformly dark just as much at the intersection as  throughout the rest. In the 1st and 2nd above, the intersections _i  k_ will not be doubled in depth as it is doubled in quantity. But in  this 3rd, at the intersections _g n_ they will be double in depth  and in quantity.    187.    HOW AND WHEN THE SURROUNDINGS IN SHADOW MINGLE THEIR DERIVED SHADOW  WITH THE LIGHT DERIVED FROM THE LUMINOUS BODY.    The derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright  light of the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade  with the light derived from the window; and these various depths of  shade modify every portion of the light, except where it is  strongest, at _c_. To prove this let _d a_ be the primary shadow  which is turned towards the point _e_, and darkens it by its derived  shadow; as may be seen by the triangle _a e d_, in which the  angle _e_ faces the darkened base _d a e_; the point _v_ faces the  dark shadow _a s_ which is part of _a d_, and as the whole is  greater than a part, _e_ which faces the whole base [of the  triangle], will be in deeper shadow than _v_ which only faces part  of it. In consequence of the conclusion [shown] in the above  diagram, _t_ will be less darkened than _v_, because the base of the  _t_ is part of the base of the _v_; and in the same way it follows  that _p_ is less in shadow than _t_, because the base of the _p_ is  part of the base of the _t_. And _c_ is the terminal point of the  derived shadow and the chief beginning of the highest light.    [Footnote: The diagram on Pl. IV, No. 5 belongs to this passage; but  it must be noted that the text explains only the figure on the  right-hand side.]    FOURTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.    On the shape of the cast shadows (188-191).    188.    The form of the shadow cast by any body of uniform density can never  be the same as that of the body producing it. [Footnote: Comp. the  drawing on PI. XXVIII, No. 5.]    189.    No cast shadow can produce the true image of the body which casts it  on a vertical plane unless the centre of the light is equally  distant from all the edges of that body.    190.    If a window _a b_ admits the sunlight into a room, the sunlight will  magnify the size of the window and diminish the shadow of a man in  such a way as that when the man makes that dim shadow of himself,  approach to that which defines the real size of the window, he will  see the shadows where they come into contact, dim and confused from  the strength of the light, shutting off and not allowing the solar  rays to pass; the effect of the shadow of the man cast by this  contact will be exactly that figured above.    [Footnote: It is scarcely possible to render the meaning of this  sentence with strict accuracy; mainly because the grammatical  construction is defective in the most important part--line 4. In the  very slight original sketch the shadow touches the upper arch of the  window and the correction, here given is perhaps not justified.]    191.    A shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which  intercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant  from the luminous body. This is proved by the 7th which says:--The  shadow will appear lighter or stronger as it is surrounded by a  darker or a lighter background. And by the 8th of this:--The  background will be in parts darker or lighter, in proportion as it  is farther from or nearer to the luminous body. And:--Of various  spots equally distant from the luminous body those will always be in  the highest light on which the rays fall at the smallest angles: The  outline of the shadow as it falls on inequalities in the surface  will be seen with all the contours similar to those of the body that  casts it, if the eye is placed just where the centre of the light  was.    The shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from the body that  casts it. The shadow _c d_, cast by the body in shadow _a b_ which  is equally distant in all parts, is not of equal depth because it is  seen on a back ground of varying brightness. [Footnote: Compare the  three diagrams on Pl. VI, no 1 which, in the original accompany this  section.]    On the outlines of cast shadows (192-195).    192.    The edges of a derived shadow will be most distinct where it is cast  nearest to the primary shadow.    193.    As the derived shadow gets more distant from the primary shadow, the  more the cast shadow differs from the primary shadow.    194.    OF SHADOWS WHICH NEVER COME TO AN END.    The greater the difference between a light and the body lighted by  it, the light being the larger, the more vague will be the outlines  of the shadow of that object.    The derived shadow will be most confused towards the edges of its  interception by a plane, where it is remotest from the body casting  it.    195.    What is the cause which makes the outlines of the shadow vague and  confused?    Whether it is possible to give clear and definite outlines to the  edges of shadows.    On the relative size of shadows (196. 197).    196.    THE BODY WHICH IS NEAREST TO THE LIGHT CASTS THE LARGEST SHADOW, AND  WHY?    If an object placed in front of a single light is very close to it  you will see that it casts a very large shadow on the opposite wall,  and the farther you remove the object from the light the smaller  will the image of the shadow become.    WHY A SHADOW LARGER THAN THE BODY THAT PRODUCES IT BECOMES OUT OF  PROPORTION.    The disproportion of a shadow which is larger than the body  producing it, results from the light being smaller than the body, so  that it cannot be at an equal distance from the edges of the body  [Footnote 11: H. LUDWIG in his edition of the old copies, in the  Vatican library--in which this chapter is included under Nos. 612,  613 and 614 alters this passage as follows: _quella parte ch'e piu  propinqua piu cresce che le distanti_, although the Vatican copy  agrees with the original MS. in having _distante_ in the former and  _propinque_ in the latter place. This supposed amendment seems to me  to invert the facts. Supposing for instance, that on Pl. XXXI No. 3.  _f_ is the spot where the light is that illuminates the figure there  represented, and that the line behind the figure represents a wall  on which the shadow of the figure is thrown. It is evident, that in  that case the nearest portion, in this case the under part of the  thigh, is very little magnified in the shadow, and the remoter  parts, for instance the head, are more magnified.]; and the portions  which are most remote are made larger than the nearer portions for  this reason [Footnote 12: See Footnote 11].    WHY A SHADOW WHICH IS LARGER THAN THE BODY CAUSING IT HAS  ILL-DEFINED OUTLINES.    The atmosphere which surrounds a light is almost like light itself  for brightness and colour; but the farther off it is the more it  loses this resemblance. An object which casts a large shadow and is  near to the light, is illuminated both by that light by the luminous  atmosphere; hence this diffused light gives the shadow ill-defined  edges.    197.    A luminous body which is long and narrow in shape gives more  confused outlines to the derived shadow than a spherical light, and  this contradicts the proposition next following: A shadow will have  its outlines more clearly defined in proportion as it is nearer to  the primary shadow or, I should say, the body casting the shadow;  [Footnote 14: The lettering refers to the lower diagram, Pl. XLI,  No. 5.] the cause of this is the elongated form of the luminous body  _a c_, &c. [Footnote 16: See Footnote 14].    Effects on cast shadows by the tone of the back ground.    198.    OF MODIFIED SHADOWS.    Modified shadows are those which are cast on light walls or other  illuminated objects.    A shadow looks darkest against a light background. The outlines of a  derived shadow will be clearer as they are nearer to the primary  shadow. A derived shadow will be most defined in shape where it is  intercepted, where the plane intercepts it at the most equal angle.    Those parts of a shadow will appear darkest which have darker  objects opposite to them. And they will appear less dark when they  face lighter objects. And the larger the light object opposite, the  more the shadow will be lightened.    And the larger the surface of the dark object the more it will  darken the derived shadow where it is intercepted.    A disputed proposition.    199.    OF THE OPINION OF SOME THAT A TRIANGLE CASTS NO SHADOW ON A PLANE  SURFACE.    Certain mathematicians have maintained that a triangle, of which the  base is turned to the light, casts no shadow on a plane; and this  they prove by saying [5] that no spherical body smaller than the  light can reach the middle with the shadow. The lines of radiant  light are straight lines [6]; therefore, suppose the light to be _g  h_ and the triangle _l m n_, and let the plane be _i k_; they say  the light _g_ falls on the side of the triangle _l n_, and the  portion of the plane _i q_. Thus again _h_ like _g_ falls on the  side _l m_, and then on _m n_ and the plane _p k_; and if the whole  plane thus faces the lights _g h_, it is evident that the triangle "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#19)"],[1,"kept close at home to protect his family and to hold  his property. But the three rangers, in fulfilling their duty had  incurred risks on their own side of the line, had been outraged,  robbed, pursued, and injured on the other.  Some of the few waterholes  that had to be reached lay far across the border in Mexican territory.  Horses had to drink, men had to drink; and Ladd and Lash were not of  the stripe that forsook a task because of danger.  Slow to wrath at  first, as became men who had long lived peaceful lives, they had at  length revolted; and desert vultures could have told a gruesome story.  Made a comrade and ally of these bordermen, Dick Gale had leaped at the  desert action and strife with an intensity of heart and a rare physical  ability which accounted for the remarkable fact that he had not yet  fallen by the way.    On this December afternoon the three rangers, as often, were separated.  Lash was far to the westward of Sonoyta, somewhere along Camino del  Diablo, that terrible Devil's Road, where many desert wayfarers had  perished.  Ladd had long been overdue in a prearranged meeting with  Gale.  The fact that Ladd had not shown up miles west of the Papago  Well was significant.    The sun had hidden behind clouds all the latter part of that day, an  unusual occurrence for that region even in winter.  And now, as the  light waned suddenly, telling of the hidden sunset, a cold dry,  penetrating wind sprang up and blew in Gale's face.  Not at first, but  by imperceptible degrees it chilled him.  He untied his coat from the  back of the saddle and put it on.  A few cold drops of rain touched his  cheek.    He halted upon the edge of a low escarpment.  Below him the narrowing  valley showed bare, black ribs of rock, long, winding gray lines  leading down to a central floor where mesquite and cactus dotted the  barren landscape.  Moving objects, diminutive in size, gray and white  in color, arrested Gale's roving sight. They bobbed away for a while,  then stopped.  They were antelope, and they had seen his horse.  When  he rode on they started once more, keeping to the lowest level.  These  wary animals were often desert watchdogs for the ranger, they would  betray the proximity of horse or man.  With them trotting forward, he  made better time for some miles across the valley.  When he lost them,  caution once more slowed his advance.    The valley sloped up and narrowed, to head into an arroyo where grass  began to show gray between the clumps of mesquite.  Shadows formed  ahead in the hollows, along the walls of the arroyo, under the trees,  and they seemed to creep, to rise, to float into a veil cast by the  background of bold mountains, at last to claim the skyline.  Night was  not close at hand, but it was there in the east, lifting upward,  drooping downward, encroaching upon the west.    Gale dismounted to lead his horse, to go forward more slowly.  He had  ridden sixty miles since morning, and he was tired, and a not entirely  healed wound in his hip made one leg drag a little.  A mile up the  arroyo, near its head, lay the Papago Well.  The need of water for his  horse entailed a risk that otherwise he could have avoided.  The well  was on Mexican soil.  Gale distinguished a faint light flickering  through the thin, sharp foliage.  Campers were at the well, and,  whoever they were, no doubt they had prevented Ladd from meeting Gale.  Ladd had gone back to the next waterhole, or maybe he was hiding in an  arroyo to the eastward, awaiting developments.    Gale turned his horse, not without urge of iron arm and persuasive  speech, for the desert steed scented water, and plodded back to the  edge of the arroyo, where in a secluded circle of mesquite he halted.  The horse snorted his relief at the removal of the heavy, burdened  saddle and accoutrements, and sagging, bent his knees, lowered himself  with slow heave, and plunged down to roll in the sand.  Gale poured the  contents of his larger canteen into his hat and held it to the horse's  nose.    \"Drink, Sol,\" he said.    It was but a drop for a thirsty horse.  However, Blanco Sol rubbed a  wet muzzle against Gale's hand in appreciation.  Gale loved the horse,  and was loved in return.  They had saved each other's lives, and had  spent long days and nights of desert solitude together. Sol had known  other masters, though none so kind as this new one; but it was certain  that Gale had never before known a horse.    The spot of secluded ground was covered with bunches of galleta grass  upon which Sol began to graze.  Gale made a long halter of his lariat  to keep the horse from wandering in search of water. Next Gale kicked  off the cumbersome chapparejos, with their flapping, tripping folds of  leather over his feet, and drawing a long rifle from its leather  sheath, he slipped away into the shadows.    The coyotes were howling, not here and there, but in concerted volume  at the head of the arroyo.  To Dick this was no more reassuring than  had been the flickering light of the campfire.  The wild desert dogs,  with their characteristic insolent curiosity, were baying men round a  campfire.  Gale proceeded slowly, halting every few steps, careful not  to brush against the stiff greasewood.  In the soft sand his steps made  no sound.  The twinkling light vanished occasionally, like a  Jack-o'lantern, and when it did show it seemed still a long way off.  Gale was not seeking trouble or inviting danger.  Water was the thing  that drove him.  He must see who these campers were, and then decide  how to give Blanco Sol a drink.    A rabbit rustled out of brush at Gale's feet and thumped away over the  sand.  The wind pattered among dry, broken stalks of dead ocatilla.  Every little sound brought Gale to a listening pause.  The gloom was  thickening fast into darkness.  It would be a night without starlight.  He moved forward up the pale, zigzag aisles between the mesquite.  He  lost the light for a while, but the coyotes' chorus told him he was  approaching the campfire.  Presently the light danced through the black  branches, and soon grew into a flame.  Stooping low, with bushy  mesquites between him and the fire, Gale advanced.  The coyotes were in  full cry.  Gale heard the tramping, stamping thumps of many hoofs.  The  sound worried him.  Foot by foot he advanced, and finally began to  crawl.  The wind favored his position, so that neither coyotes nor  horses could scent him.  The nearer he approached the head of the  arroyo, where the well was located, the thicker grew the desert  vegetation.  At length a dead palo verde, with huge black clumps of its  parasite mistletoe thick in the branches, marked a distance from the  well that Gale considered close enough.  Noiselessly he crawled here  and there until he secured a favorable position, and then rose to peep  from behind his covert.    He saw a bright fire, not a cooking-fire, for that would have been low  and red, but a crackling blaze of mesquite.  Three men were in sight,  all close to the burning sticks.  They were Mexicans and of the coarse  type of raiders, rebels, bandits that Gale expected to see.  One stood  up, his back to the fire; another sat with shoulders enveloped in a  blanket, and the third lounged in the sand, his feet almost in the  blaze.  They had cast off belts and weapons.  A glint of steel caught  Gale's eye.  Three short, shiny carbines leaned against a rock.  A  little to the left, within the circle of light, stood a square house  made of adobe bricks. Several untrimmed poles upheld a roof of brush,  which was partly fallen in.  This house was a Papago Indian habitation,  and a month before had been occupied by a family that had been murdered  or driven off by a roving band of outlaws.  A rude corral showed dimly  in the edge of firelight, and from a black mass within came the snort  and stamp and whinney of horses.    Gale took in the scene in one quick glance, then sank down at the foot  of the mesquite.  He had naturally expected to see more men. But the  situation was by no means new.  This was one, or part of one, of the  raider bands harrying the border.  They were stealing horses, or  driving a herd already stolen.  These bands were more numerous than the  waterholes of northern Sonora; they never camped long at one place;  like Arabs, they roamed over the desert all the way from Nogales to  Casita.  If Gale had gone peaceably up to this campfire there were a  hundred chances that the raiders would kill and rob him to one chance  that they might not.  If they recognized him as a ranger comrade of  Ladd and Lash, if they got a glimpse of Blanco Sol, then Gale would  have no chance.    These Mexicans had evidently been at the well some time.  Their horses  being in the corral meant that grazing had been done by day.  Gale  revolved questions in mind.  Had this trio of outlaws run across Ladd?  It was not likely, for in that event they might not have been so  comfortable and care-free in camp.  Were they waiting for more members  of their gang?  That was very probable. With Gale, however, the most  important consideration was how to get his horse to water.  Sol must  have a drink if it cost a fight. There was stern reason for Gale to  hurry eastward along the trail. He thought it best to go back to where  he had left his horse and not make any decisive move until daylight.    With the same noiseless care he had exercised in the advance, Gale  retreated until it was safe for him to rise and walk on down the  arroyo.  He found Blanco Sol contentedly grazing.  A heavy dew was  falling, and, as the grass was abundant, the horse did not show the  usual restlessness and distress after a dry and exhausting day. Gale  carried his saddle blankets and bags into the lee of a little  greasewood-covered mound, from around which the wind had cut the soil,  and here, in a wash, he risked building a small fire. By this time the  wind was piercingly cold.  Gale's"]]]
