He was fighting that something beautiful might be  raised up out of chaos and despair and be made to exist; he was  fighting for life in place of death, for happiness in place of grief,  for light in place of darkness--fighting to save where others would  destroy. Therefore the great lie was not a lie but a thing without  venom or hurt, an instrument for happiness and for all the things good  and beautiful that went to make happiness. It was his one great weapon.  Without it he would fail, and failure meant desolation. So he spoke  convincingly, for what he said came straight from the heart though it  was born in the shadow of that one master-falsehood. His wonder was  that Mary Josephine believed him so utterly that not for an instant was  there a questioning doubt in her eyes or on her lips.    He told her how much he \"remembered,\" which was no more and no less  than he had learned from the letters and the clippings. The story did  not appeal to him as particularly unusual or dramatic. He had passed  through too many tragic happenings in the last four years to regard it  in that way. It was simply an unfortunate affair beginning in  misfortune, and with its necessary whirlwind of hurt and sorrow. The  one thing of shame he would not keep out of his mind was that he,  Derwent Conniston, must have been a poor type of big brother in those  days of nine or ten years ago, even though little Mary Josephine had  worshiped him. He was well along in his twenties then. The Connistons  of Darlington were his uncle and aunt, and his uncle was a more or less  prominent figure in ship-building interests on the Clyde. With these  people the three--himself, Mary Josephine, and his brother Egbert--had  lived, \"farmed out\" to a hard-necked, flinty-hearted pair of relatives  because of a brother's stipulation and a certain English law. With them  they had existed in mutual discontent and dislike. Derwent, when he  became old enough, had stepped over the traces. All this Keith had  gathered from the letters, but there was a great deal that was missing.  Egbert, he gathered, must have been a scapegrace. He was a cripple of  some sort and seven or eight years his junior. In the letters Mary  Josephine had spoken of him as \"poor Egbert,\" pitying instead of  condemning him, though it was Egbert who had brought tragedy and  separation upon them. One night Egbert had broken open the Conniston  safe and in the darkness had had a fight and a narrow escape from his  uncle, who laid the crime upon Derwent. And Derwent, in whom Egbert  must have confided, had fled to America that the cripple might be  saved, with the promise that some day he would send for Mary Josephine.  He was followed by the uncle's threat that if he ever returned to  England, he would be jailed. Not long afterward \"poor Egbert\" was found  dead in bed, fearfully contorted. Keith guessed there had been  something mentally as well as physically wrong with him.    \"--And I was going to send for you,\" he said, as they came to the level  of the valley. \"My plans were made, and I was going to send for you,  when this came.\"    He stopped, and in a few tense, breathless moments Mary Josephine read  the ninth and last letter he had taken from the Englishman's chest. It  was from her uncle. In a dozen lines it stated that she, Mary  Josephine, was dead, and it reiterated the threat against Derwent  Conniston should he ever dare to return to England.    A choking cry came to her lips. \"And that--THAT was it?\"    \"Yes, that--and the hurt in my head,\" he said, remembering the part he  must play. \"They came at about the same time, and the two of them must  have put the grain of sand in my brain.\"    It was hard to lie now, looking straight into her face that had gone  suddenly white, and with her wonderful eyes burning deep into his soul.    She did not seem, for an instant, to hear his voice or sense his words.  \"I understand now,\" she was saying, the letter crumpling in her  fingers. \"I was sick for almost a year, Derry. They thought I was going  to die. He must have written it then, and they destroyed my letters to  you, and when I was better they told me you were dead, and then I  didn't write any more. And I wanted to die. And then, almost a year  ago, Colonel Reppington came to me, and his dear old voice was so  excited that it trembled, and he told me that he believed you were  alive. A friend of his had just returned from British Columbia, and  this friend told him that three years before, while on a grizzly  shooting trip, he had met a man named Conniston, an Englishman. We  wrote a hundred letters up there and found the man, Jack Otto, who was  in the mountains with you, and then I knew you were alive. But we  couldn't find you after that, and so I came--\"    He would have wagered that she was going to cry, but she fought the  tears back, smiling.    \"And--and I've found you!\" she finished triumphantly.    She snuggled close to him, and he slipped an arm about her waist, and  they walked on. She told him about her arrival in Halifax, how Colonel  Reppington had given her letters to nice people in Montreal and  Winnipeg, and how it happened one day that she found his name in one of  the Mounted Police blue books, and after that came on as fast as she  could to surprise him at Prince Albert. When she came to that point,  Keith pointed once more into the west and said:    \"And there is our new world. Let us forget the old. Shall we, Mary  Josephine?\"    \"Yes,\" she whispered, and her hand sought his again and crept into it,  warm and confident.          XV      They went on through the golden morning, the earth damp under their  feet, the air filled with its sweet incense, on past scattered clumps  of balsams and cedars until they came to the river and looked down on  its yellow sand-bars glistening in the sun. The town was hidden. They  heard no sound from it. And looking up the great Saskatchewan, the  river of mystery, of romance, of glamour, they saw before them, where  the spruce walls seemed to meet, the wide-open door through which they  might pass into the western land beyond. Keith pointed it out. And he  pointed out the yellow bars, the glistening shores of sand, and told  her how even as far as this, a thousand miles by river--those sands  brought gold with them from the mountains, the gold whose  treasure-house no man had ever found, and which must be hidden up there  somewhere near the river's end. His dream, like Duggan's, had been to  find it. Now they would search for it together.    Slowly he was picking his way so that at last they came to the bit of  cleared timber in which was his old home. His heart choked him as they  drew near. There was an uncomfortable tightness in his breath. The  timber was no longer \"clear.\" In four years younger generations of life  had sprung up among the trees, and the place was jungle-ridden. They  were within a few yards of the house before Mary Josephine saw it, and  then she stopped suddenly with a little gasp. For this that she faced  was not desertion, was not mere neglect. It was tragedy. She saw in an  instant that there was no life in this place, and yet it stood as if  tenanted. It was a log chateau with a great, red chimney rising at one  end curtains and shades still hung at the windows. There were three  chairs on the broad veranda that looked riverward. But two of the  windows were broken, and the chairs were falling into ruin. There was  no life. They were facing only the ghosts of life.    A swift glance into Keith's face told her this was so. His lips were  set tight. There was a strange look in his face. Hand in hand they had  come up, and her fingers pressed his tighter now.    \"What is it?\" she asked.    \"It is John Keith's home as he left it four years ago,\" he replied.    The suspicious break in his voice drew her eyes from the chateau to his  own again. She could see him fighting. There was a twitching in his  throat. His hand was gripping hers until it hurt.    \"John Keith?\" she whispered softly.    \"Yes, John Keith.\"    She inclined her head so that it rested lightly and affectionately  against his arm.    \"You must have thought a great deal of him, Derry.\"    \"Yes.\"    He freed her hand, and his fists clenched convulsively. She could feel  the cording of the muscles in his arm, his face was white, and in his  eyes was a fixed stare that startled her. He fumbled in a pocket and  drew out a key.    \"I promised, when he died, that I would go in and take a last look for  him,\" he said. \"He loved this place. Do you want to go with me?\"    She drew a deep breath. \"Yes.\"    The key opened the door that entered on the veranda. As it swung back,  grating on its rusty hinges, they found themselves facing the chill of  a cold and lifeless air. Keith stepped inside. A glance told him that  nothing was changed--everything was there in that room with the big  fireplace, even as he had left it the night he set out to force justice  from Judge Kirkstone. One thing startled him. On the dust-covered table  was a bowl and a spoon. He remembered vividly how he had eaten his  supper that night of bread and milk. It was the littleness of the  thing, the simplicity of it, that shocked him. The bowl and spoon were  still there after four years. He did not reflect that they were as  imperishable as all the other things about; the miracle was that they  were there on the table, as though he had used them only yesterday. The  most trivial things in the room struck him deepest, and he found  himself fighting hard, for a moment, to keep his nerve.    \"He told me about the bowl and the spoon, John Keith did,\" he said,  nodding toward them. \"He told me just what I'd find here, even to that.  You see, he loved the place greatly and everything that was in it. It  was impossible for him to forget even the bowl and the spoon and where  he had left them.\"    It was easier after that. The old home was whispering back"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#19)"],[1,"to keep it from her. He had  been away ten days on the trip to Lac Bain, and he brought back to  Nepeese the joyous news that M'sieu McTaggart was very sick with  pechipoo--the blood poison--news that made the Willow clap her hands  and laugh happily. But he knew that the factor would get well, and that  he would come again to their cabin on the Gray Loon. And when next time  he came--    It was while he was thinking of this that his face grew cold and hard,  and his eyes burned. And he was thinking of it on this her birthday,  even as her laughter floated to him like a song. Dieu, in spite of her  seventeen years, she was nothing but a child--a baby! She could not  guess his horrible visions. And the dread of awakening her for all time  from that beautiful childhood kept him from telling her the whole truth  so that she might have understood fully and completely. Non, it should  not be that. His soul beat with a great and gentle love. He, Pierrot Du  Quesne, would do the watching. And she should laugh and sing and  play--and have no share in the black forebodings that had come to spoil  his life.    On this day there came up from the south MacDonald, the government map  maker. He was gray and grizzled, with a great, free laugh and a clean  heart. Two days he remained with Pierrot. He told Nepeese of his  daughters at home, of their mother, whom he worshiped more than  anything else on earth--and before he went on in his quest of the last  timber line of Banksian pine, he took pictures of the Willow as he had  first seen her on her birthday: her hair piled in glossy coils, her red  dress, the high-heeled shoes. He carried the negatives on with him,  promising Pierrot that he would get a picture back in some way. Thus  fate works in its strange and apparently innocent ways as it spins its  webs of tragedy.      For many weeks after MacDonald's visit there followed tranquil days on  the Gray Loon. They were wonderful days for Baree. At first he was  suspicious of Pierrot. After a little he tolerated him, and at last  accepted him as a part of the cabin--and Nepeese. It was the Willow  whose shadow he became. Pierrot noted the attachment with the deepest  satisfaction.    \"Ah, in a few months more, if he should leap at the throat of M'sieu  the Factor,\" he said to himself one day.    In September, when he was six months old, Baree was almost as large as  Gray Wolf--big-boned, long-fanged, with a deep chest, and jaws that  could already crack a bone as if it were a stick. He was with Nepeese  whenever and wherever she moved. They swam together in the two  pools--the pool in the forest and the pool between the chasm walls. At  first it alarmed Baree to see Nepeese dive from the rock wall over  which she had pushed McTaggart, but at the end of a month she had  taught him to plunge after her through that twenty feet of space.    It was late in August when Baree saw the first of his kind outside of  Kazan and Gray Wolf. During the summer Pierrot allowed his dogs to run  at large on a small island in the center of a lake two or three miles  away, and twice a week he netted fish for them. On one of these trips  Nepeese accompanied him and took Baree with her. Pierrot carried his  long caribou-gut whip. He expected a fight. But there was none. Baree  joined the pack in their rush for fish, and ate with them. This pleased  Pierrot more than ever.    \"He will make a great sledge dog,\" he chuckled. \"It is best to leave  him for a week with the pack, ma Nepeese.\"    Reluctantly Nepeese gave her consent. While the dogs were still at  their fish, they started homeward. Their canoe had slipped away before  Baree discovered the trick they had played on him. Instantly he leaped  into the water and swam after them--and the Willow helped him into his  canoe.    Early in September a passing Indian brought Pierrot word of Bush  McTaggart. The factor had been very sick. He had almost died from the  blood poison, but he was well now. With the first exhilarating tang of  autumn in the air a new dread oppressed Pierrot. But at present he said  nothing of what was in his mind to Nepeese. The Willow had almost  forgotten the factor from Lac Bain, for the glory and thrill of  wilderness autumn was in her blood. She went on long trips with  Pierrot, helping him to blaze out the new trap lines that would be used  when the first snows came, and on these journeys she was always  accompanied by Baree.    Most of Nepeese's spare hours she spent in training him for the sledge.  She began with a babiche string and a stick. It was a whole day before  she could induce Baree to drag this stick without turning at every  other step to snap and growl at it. Then she fastened another length of  babiche to him, and made him drag two sticks. Thus little by little she  trained him to the sledge harness, until at the end of a fortnight he  was tugging heroically at anything she had a mind to fasten him to.  Pierrot brought home two of the dogs from the island, and Baree was put  into training with these, and helped to drag the empty sledge. Nepeese  was delighted. On the day the first light snow fell she clapped her  hands and cried to Pierrot:    \"By midwinter I will have him the finest dog in the pack, mon pere!\"    This was the time for Pierrot to say what was in his mind. He smiled.  Diantre--would not that beast the factor fall into the very devil of a  rage when he found how he had been cheated! And yet--    He tried to make his voice quiet and commonplace.    \"I am going to send you down to the school at Nelson House again this  winter, ma cherie,\" he said. \"Baree will help draw you down on the  first good snow.\"    The Willow was tying a knot in Baree's babiche, and she rose slowly to  her feet and looked at Pierrot. Her eyes were big and dark and steady.    \"I am not going, mon pere!\"    It was the first time Nepeese had ever said that to Pierrot--in just  that way. It thrilled him. And he could scarcely face the look in her  eyes. He was not good at bluffing. She saw what was in his face; it  seemed to him that she was reading what was in his mind, and that she  grew a little taller as she stood there. Certainly her breath came  quicker, and he could see the throb of her breast. Nepeese did not wait  for him to gather speech.    \"I am not going!\" she repeated with even greater finality, and bent  again over Baree.    With a shrug of his shoulders Pierrot watched her. After all, was he  not glad? Would his heart not have turned sick if she had been happy at  the thought of leaving him? He moved to her side and with great  gentleness laid a hand on her glossy head. Up from under it the Willow  smiled at him. Between them they heard the click of Baree's jaws as he  rested his muzzle on the Willow's arm. For the first time in weeks the  world seemed suddenly filled with sunshine for Pierrot. When he went  back to the cabin he held his head higher. Nepeese would not leave him!  He laughed softly. He rubbed his hands together. His fear of the factor  from Lac Bain was gone. From the cabin door he looked back at Nepeese  and Baree.    \"The Saints be blessed!\" he murmured. \"Now--now--it is Pierrot Du  Quesne who knows what to do!\"        CHAPTER 17    Back to Lac Bain, late in September, came MacDonald the map maker. For  ten days Gregson, the investigating agent, had been Bush McTaggart's  guest at the Post, and twice in that time it had come into Marie's mind  to creep upon him while he slept and kill him. The factor himself paid  little attention to her now, a fact which would have made her happy if  it had not been for Gregson. He was enraptured with the wild, sinuous  beauty of the Cree girl, and McTaggart, without jealousy, encouraged  him. He was tired of Marie.    McTaggart told Gregson this. He wanted to get rid of her, and if  he--Gregson--could possibly take her along with him it would be a great  favor. He explained why. A little later, when the deep snows came, he  was going to bring the daughter of Pierrot Du Quesne to the Post. In  the rottenness of their brotherhood he told of his visit, of the manner  of his reception, and of the incident at the chasm. In spite of all  this, he assured Gregson, Pierrot's girl would soon be at Lac Bain.    It was at this time that MacDonald came. He remained only one night,  and without knowing that he was adding fuel to a fire already  dangerously blazing, he gave the photograph he had taken of Nepeese to  the factor. It was a splendid picture.    \"If you can get it down to that girl some day I'll be mightily  obliged,\" he said to McTaggart. \"I promised her one. Her father's name  is Du Quesne--Pierrot Du Quesne. You probably know them. And the girl--\"    His blood warmed as he described to McTaggart how beautiful she was  that day in her red dress, which appeared black in the photograph. He  did not guess how near McTaggart's blood was to the boiling point.    The next day MacDonald started for Norway House. McTaggart did not show  Gregson the picture. He kept it to himself and at night, under the glow  of his lamp, he looked at it with thoughts that filled him with a  growing resolution. There was but one way. The scheme had been in his  mind for weeks--and the picture determined him. He dared not whisper  his secret even to Gregson. But it was the one way. It would give him  Nepeese. Only--he must wait for the deep snows, the midwinter snows.  They buried their tragedies deepest.    McTaggart was glad when Gregson followed the map maker to Norway House.  Out of courtesy he accompanied him a day's journey on his way. When he  returned to the Post, Marie was gone. He was glad. He sent off a runner  with a load of presents for her people, and the message: \"Don't beat  her. Keep her. She is free.\"    Along with the bustle and stir of the beginning of the trapping season  McTaggart began to prepare his house for the coming of Nepeese. He knew  what she liked in the way of cleanliness and a few other"]]]
