[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10523"],[0,"Alcestis (#2)"],[1," is Satyric, as here, the same process produces almost an opposite effect.  It is somewhat as though the main plot of a gross and jolly farce were  pondered over and made more true to human character till it emerged as a  refined and rather pathetic comedy. The making drunk of the Three Grey  Sisters disappears; one can only just see the trace of its having once  been present. The revelling of Heracles is touched in with the lightest of  hands; it is little more than symbolic. And all the figures in the story,  instead of being left broadly comic or having their psychology neglected,  are treated delicately, sympathetically, with just that faint touch of  satire, or at least of amusement, which is almost inseparable from a close  interest in character.    What was Admetus really like, this gallant prince who had won the  affection of such great guests as Apollo and Heracles, and yet went round  asking other people to die for him; who, in particular, accepted his  wife's monstrous sacrifice with satisfaction and gratitude? The play  portrays him well. Generous, innocent, artistic, affectionate, eloquent,  impulsive, a good deal spoilt, unconsciously insincere, and no doubt  fundamentally selfish, he hates the thought of dying and he hates losing  his wife almost as much. Why need she die? Why could it not have been some  one less important to him? He feels with emotion what a beautiful act it  would have been for his old father. \"My boy, you have a long and happy  life before you, and for me the sands are well-nigh run out. Do not seek  to dissuade me. I will die for you.\" Admetus could compose the speech for  him. A touching scene, a noble farewell, and all the dreadful trouble  solved--so conveniently solved! And the miserable self-blinded old man  could not see it!    Euripides seems to have taken positive pleasure in Admetus, much as  Meredith did in his famous Egoist; but Euripides all through is kinder to  his victim than Meredith is. True, Admetus is put to obvious shame,  publicly and helplessly. The Chorus make discreet comments upon him.  The Handmaid is outspoken about him. One feels that Alcestis herself, for  all her tender kindness, has seen through him. Finally, to make things  quite clear, his old father fights him openly, tells him home-truth upon  home-truth, tears away all his protective screens, and leaves him with his  self-respect in tatters. It is a fearful ordeal for Admetus, and, after  his first fury, he takes it well. He comes back from his wife's burial a  changed man. He says not much, but enough. \"I have done wrong. I have only  now learnt my lesson. I imagined I could save my happy life by forfeiting  my honour; and the result is that I have lost both.\" I think that a  careful reading of the play will show an almost continuous process of  self-discovery and self-judgment in the mind of Admetus. He was a man who  blinded himself with words and beautiful sentiments; but he was not  thick-skinned or thick-witted. He was not a brute or a cynic. And I think  he did learn his lesson ... not completely and for ever, but as well as  most of us learn such lessons.    The beauty of Alcestis is quite untouched by the dramatist's keener  analysis. The strong light only increases its effect. Yet she is not by  any means a mere blameless ideal heroine; and the character which  Euripides gives her makes an admirable foil to that of Admetus. Where he  is passionate and romantic, she is simple and homely. While he is still  refusing to admit the facts and beseeching her not to \"desert\" him, she in  a gentle but businesslike way makes him promise to take care of the  children and, above all things, not to marry again. She could not possibly  trust Admetus's choice. She is sure that the step-mother would be unkind  to the children. She might be a horror and beat them (l. 307). And when  Admetus has made a thrilling answer about eternal sorrow, and the  silencing of lyre and lute, and the statue who shall be his only bride,  Alcestis earnestly calls the attention of witnesses to the fact that he  has sworn not to marry again. She is not an artist like Admetus. There is  poetry in her, because poetry comes unconsciously out of deep feeling, but  there is no artistic eloquence. Her love, too, is quite different from  his. To him, his love for his wife and children is a beautiful thing, a  subject to speak and sing about as well as an emotion to feel. But her  love is hardly conscious. She does not talk about it at all. She is merely  wrapped up in the welfare of certain people, first her husband and then he  children. To a modern romantic reader her insistence that her husband  shall not marry again seems hardly delicate. But she does not think about  romance or delicacy. To her any neglect to ensure due protection for the  children would be as unnatural as to refuse to die for her husband.  Indeed, Professor J.L. Myres has suggested that care for the children's  future is the guiding motive of her whole conduct. There was first the  danger of their being left fatherless, a dire calamity in the heroic age.  She could meet that danger by dying herself. Then followed the danger of a  stepmother. She meets that by making Admetus swear never to marry. In the  long run, I fancy, the effect of gracious loveliness which Alcestis  certainly makes is not so much due to any words of her own as to what the  Handmaid and the Serving Man say about her. In the final scene she is  silent; necessarily and rightly silent, for all tradition knows that those  new-risen from the dead must not speak. It will need a long _rite de  passage_ before she can freely commune with this world again. It is a  strange and daring scene between the three of them; the humbled and  broken-hearted husband; the triumphant Heracles, kindly and wise, yet  still touched by the mocking and blustrous atmosphere from which he  sprang; and the silent woman who has seen the other side of the grave.  It was always her way to know things but not to speak of them.    The other characters fall easily into their niches. We have only to  remember the old Satyric tradition and to look at them in the light of  their historical development. Heracles indeed, half-way on his road from  the roaring reveller of the Satyr-play to the suffering and erring  deliverer of tragedy, is a little foreign to our notions, but quite  intelligible and strangely attractive. The same historical method seems to  me to solve most of the difficulties which have been felt about Admetus's  hospitality. Heracles arrives at the castle just at the moment when  Alcestis is lying dead in her room; Admetus conceals the death from him  and insists on his coming in and enjoying himself. What are we to think of  this behaviour? Is it magnificent hospitality, or is it gross want of  tact? The answer, I think, is indicated above.    In the uncritical and boisterous atmosphere of the Satyr-play it was  natural hospitality, not especially laudable or surprising. From the  analogy of similar stories I suspect that Admetus originally did not know  his guest, and received not so much the reward of exceptional virtue as  the blessing naturally due to those who entertain angels unawares. If we  insist on asking whether Euripides himself, in real life or in a play of  his own free invention, would have considered Admetus's conduct to  Heracles entirely praiseworthy, the answer will certainly be No, but it  will have little bearing on the play. In the _Alcestis_, as it stands, the  famous act of hospitality is a datum of the story. Its claims are admitted  on the strength of the tradition. It was the act for which Admetus was  specially and marvellously rewarded; therefore, obviously, it was an act  of exceptional merit and piety. Yet the admission is made with a smile,  and more than one suggestion is allowed to float across the scene that in  real life such conduct would be hardly wise.    Heracles, who rose to tragic rank from a very homely cycle of myth, was  apt to bring other homely characters with him. He was a great killer not  only of malefactors but of \"keres\" or bogeys, such as \"Old Age\" and \"Ague\"  and the sort of \"Death\" that we find in this play. Thanatos is not a god,  not at all a King of Terrors. One may compare him with the dancing  skeleton who is called Death in mediaeval writings. When such a figure  appears on the tragic stage one asks at once what relation he bears to  Hades, the great Olympian king of the unseen. The answer is obvious.  Thanatos is the servant of Hades, a \"priest\" or sacrificer, who is sent to  fetch the appointed victims.    The other characters speak for themselves. Certainly Pheres can be trusted  to do so, though we must remember that we see him at an unfortunate  moment. The aged monarch is not at his best, except perhaps in mere  fighting power. I doubt if he was really as cynical as he here professes  to be.           *       *       *       *       *    In the above criticisms I feel that I may have done what critics are so  apt to do. I have dwelt on questions of intellectual interest and perhaps  thereby diverted attention from that quality in the play which is the most  important as well as by far the hardest to convey; I mean the sheer beauty  and delightfulness of the writing. It is the earliest dated play of  Euripides which has come down to us. True, he was over forty when he  produced it, but it is noticeably different from the works of his old age.  The numbers are smoother, the thought less deeply scarred, the language  more charming and less passionate. If it be true that poetry is bred out  of joy and sorrow, one feels as if more enjoyment and less suffering had  gone to the making of the _Alcestis_ than to that of the later plays.

And so the hours passed, and naught happened more than I have told, save  that once, a little after midnight, the trees opposite to us seemed to be  stirred again, as though some creature, or creatures, lurked among them;  and there came, a little after that, a sound as of something stirring the  water up against the bank; but it ceased in a while and the silence fell  once more.    Thus, after a weariful time, away Eastwards the sky began to tell of the  coming of the day; and, as the light grew and strengthened, so did that  insatiable growling pass hence with the dark and the shadows. And so at  last came the day, and once more there was borne to us the sad wailing  that had preceded the night. For a certain while it lasted, rising and  falling most mournfully over the vastness of the surrounding wastes,  until the sun was risen some degrees above the horizon; after which it  began to fail, dying away in lingering echoes, most solemn to our ears.  And so it passed, and there came again the silence that had been with us  in all the daylight hours.    Now, it being day, the bo'sun bade us make such sparse breakfast as our  provender allowed; after which, having first scanned the banks to  discern if any fearful thing were visible, we took again to our oars,  and proceeded on our upward journey; for we hoped presently to come upon  a country where life had not become extinct, and where we could put foot  to honest earth. Yet, as I have made mention earlier, the vegetation,  where it grew, did flourish most luxuriantly; so that I am scarce  correct when I speak of life as being extinct in that land. For, indeed,  now I think of it, I can remember that the very mud from which it sprang  seemed veritably to have a fat, sluggish life of its own, so rich and  viscid was it.    Presently it was midday; yet was there but little change in the nature of  the surrounding wastes; though it may be that the vegetation was  something thicker, and more continuous along the banks. But the banks  were still of the same thick, clinging mud; so that nowhere could we  effect a landing; though, had we, the rest of the country beyond the  banks seemed no better.    And all the while, as we pulled, we glanced continuously from bank to  bank; and those who worked not at the oars were fain to rest a hand by  their sheath-knives; for the happenings of the past night were  continually in our minds, and we were in great fear; so that we had  turned back to the sea but that we had come so nigh to the end of our  provisions.          II    The Ship in the Creek      Then, it was nigh on to evening, we came upon a creek opening into the  greater one through the bank upon our left. We had been like to pass  it--as, indeed, we had passed many throughout the day--but that the  bo'sun, whose boat had the lead, cried out that there was some craft  lying-up, a little beyond the first bend. And, indeed, so it seemed; for  one of the masts of her--all jagged, where it had carried away--stuck up  plain to our view.    Now, having grown sick with so much lonesomeness, and being in fear of  the approaching night, we gave out something near to a cheer, which,  however, the bo'sun silenced, having no knowledge of those who might  occupy the stranger. And so, in silence, the bo'sun turned his craft  toward the creek, whereat we followed, taking heed to keep quietness, and  working the oars warily. So, in a little, we came to the shoulder of the  bend, and had plain sight of the vessel some little way beyond us. From  the distance she had no appearance of being inhabited; so that after some  small hesitation, we pulled towards her, though still being at pains to  keep silence.    The strange vessel lay against that bank of the creek which was upon our  right, and over above her was a thick clump of the stunted trees. For the  rest, she appeared to be firmly imbedded in the heavy mud, and there was  a certain look of age about her which carried to me a doleful suggestion  that we should find naught aboard of her fit for an honest stomach.    We had come to a distance of maybe some ten fathoms from her starboard  bow--for she lay with her head down towards the mouth of the little  creek--when the bo'sun bade his men to back water, the which Josh did  regarding our own boat. Then, being ready to fly if we had been in  danger, the bo'sun hailed the stranger; but got no reply, save that some  echo of his shout seemed to come back at us. And so he sung out again to  her, chance there might be some below decks who had not caught his first  hail; but, for the second time, no answer came to us, save the low  echo--naught, but that the silent trees took on a little quivering, as  though his voice had shaken them.    At that, being confident now within our minds, we laid alongside, and, in  a minute had shinned up the oars and so gained her decks. Here, save that  the glass of the skylight of the main cabin had been broken, and some  portion of the framework shattered, there was no extraordinary litter; so  that it appeared to us as though she had been no great while abandoned.    So soon as the bo'sun had made his way up from the boat, he turned aft  toward the scuttle, the rest of us following. We found the leaf of the  scuttle pulled forward to within an inch of closing, and so much effort  did it require of us to push it back, that we had immediate evidence of a  considerable time since any had gone down that way.    However, it was no great while before we were below, and here we found  the main cabin to be empty, save for the bare furnishings. From it there  opened off two state-rooms at the forrard end, and the captain's cabin in  the after part, and in all of these we found matters of clothing and  sundries such as proved that the vessel had been deserted apparently in  haste. In further proof of this we found, in a drawer in the captain's  room, a considerable quantity of loose gold, the which it was not to be  supposed would have been left by the free-will of the owner.    Of the staterooms, the one upon the starboard side gave evidence that it  had been occupied by a woman--no doubt a passenger. The other, in which  there were two bunks, had been shared, so far as we could have any  certainty, by a couple of young men; and this we gathered by observation  of various garments which were scattered carelessly about.    Yet it must not be supposed that we spent any great time in the cabins;  for we were pressed for food, and made haste--under the directing of  the bo'sun--to discover if the hulk held victuals whereby we might be  kept alive.    To this end, we removed the hatch which led down to the lazarette, and,  lighting two lamps which we had with us in the boats, went down to make a  search. And so, in a little while, we came upon two casks which the  bo'sun broke open with a hatchet. These casks were sound and tight, and  in them was ship's biscuit, very good and fit for food. At this, as may  be imagined, we felt eased in our minds, knowing that there was no  immediate fear of starvation. Following this, we found a barrel of  molasses; a cask of rum; some cases of dried fruit--these were mouldy and  scarce fit to be eaten; a cask of salt beef, another of pork; a small  barrel of vinegar; a case of brandy; two barrels of flour--one of which  proved to be damp-struck; and a bunch of tallow dips.    In a little while we had all these things up in the big cabin, so that  we might come at them the better to make choice of that which was fit for  our stomachs, and that which was otherwise. Meantime, whilst the bo'sun  overhauled these matters, Josh called a couple of the men, and went on  deck to bring up the gear from the boats, for it had been decided that we  should pass the night aboard the hulk.    When this was accomplished, Josh took a walk forward to the fo'cas'le;  but found nothing beyond two seamen's chests; a sea-bag, and some odd  gear. There were, indeed, no more than ten bunks in the place; for she  was but a small brig, and had no call for a great crowd. Yet Josh was  more than a little puzzled to know what had come to the odd chests; for  it was not to be supposed that there had been no more than two--and a  sea-bag--among ten men. But to this, at that time, he had no answer, and  so, being sharp for supper, made a return to the deck, and thence to the  main cabin.    Now while he had been gone, the bo'sun had set the men to clearing out  the main cabin; after which, he had served out two biscuits apiece all  round, and a tot of rum. To Josh, when he appeared, he gave the same,  and, in a little, we called a sort of council; being sufficiently stayed  by the food to talk.    Yet, before we came to speech, we made shift to light our pipes; for the  bo'sun had discovered a case of tobacco in the captain's cabin, and after  this we came to the consideration of our position.    We had provender, so the bo'sun calculated, to last us for the better  part of two months, and this without any great stint; but we had yet to  prove if the brig held water in her casks, for that in the creek was  brackish, even so far as we had penetrated from the sea; else we had not  been in need. To the charge of this, the bo'sun set Josh, along with two  of the men. Another, he told to take charge of the galley, so long as we  were in the hulk. But for that night, he said we had no need to do  aught; for we had sufficient of water in the boats' breakers to last us  till the morrow. And so, in a little, the dusk began to fill the cabin;  but we talked on, being greatly content with our present ease and the  good tobacco which we enjoyed.    In a little while, one of the men cried out suddenly to us to be silent,  and, in that minute, all heard it--a far, drawn-out wailing; the same  which had come to us in the evening of the first day. At that we looked  at one another through the smoke and the growing dark,"]]]
