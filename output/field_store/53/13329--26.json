How should they know, who wheel around my burning,      What torments bore them, or what power am I,    I, that with all those worlds around me turning,      Sail, every hour, from sky to unplumbed sky?      My planets, these live embers of my passion,      These children of my hurricanes of flame,    Flung thro' the night, for midnight to refashion,      Praise, and forget, the splendour whence they came.      THE EARTH      _Was it a dream that, in those bright dominions,      Are other worlds that sing, with lives like mine,    Lives that with beating hearts and broken pinions      Aspire and fall, half-mortal, half-divine?      A grain of dust among those glittering legions--      Am I, I only, touched with joy and tears?    0, silver sisters, from your azure regions,      Breathe, once again, your music of the spheres:--_      VENUS      A nearer sun, a rose of light arises,      To clothe my glens with richer clouds of flowers,    To paint my clouds with ever new surprises      And wreathe with mist my rosier domes and towers;      Where now, to praise their gods, a throng assembles      Whose hopes and dreams no sphere but mine has known.    On other worlds the same warm sunlight trembles;      But life, love, worship, these are mine alone.      MARS      And now, as dewdrops in the dawn-light glisten,      Remote and cold--see--Earth and Venus roll.    We signalled them--in music! Did they listen?      Could they not hear those whispers of the soul?      May not their flesh have sealed that fount of glory,      That pure ninth sense which told us of mankind?    Can some deep sleep bereave them of our story      As darkness hides all colours from the blind?      JUPITER      I that am sailing deeper skies and dimmer,      Twelve million leagues beyond the path of Mars,    Salute the sun, that cloudy pearl, whose glimmer      Renews my spring and steers me through the stars.      Think not that I by distances am darkened.      My months are years; yet light is in mine eyes.    Mine eyes are not as yours. Mine ears have hearkened      To sounds from earth. Five moons enchant my skies.      SATURN      And deeper yet, like molten opal shining      My belt of rainbow glory softly streams.    And seven white moons around me intertwining      Hide my vast beauty in a mist of dreams.      Huge is my orbit; and your flickering planet      A mote that flecks your sun, that faint white star;    Yet, in my magic pools, I still can scan it;      For I have ways to look on worlds afar.      URANUS      And deeper yet--twelve million leagues of twilight      Divide mine empire even from Saturn's ken.    Is there a world whose light is not as my light,      A midget world of light-imprisoned men?      Shut from this inner vision that hath found me,      They hunt bright shadows, painted to betray;    And know not that, because their night hath drowned me,      My giants walk with gods in boundless day.      NEPTUNE      Plunge through immensity anew and find me.      Though scarce I see your sun,--that dying spark--    Across a myriad leagues it still can bind me      To my sure path, and steer me through the dark.      I sail through vastness, and its rhythms hold me,      Though threescore earths could in my volume sleep!    Whose are the might and music that enfold me?      Whose is the law that guides me thro' the Deep?      THE SUN      _I hear their song. They wheel around my burning!      I know their orbits; but what path have I?    I that with all those worlds around me turning      Sail, every hour, ten thousand leagues of sky?_      _My planets, these live embers of my passion,      And I, too, filled with music and with flame.    Flung thro' the night, for midnight to refashion,      Praise and forget the Splendour whence we came._          EPILOGUE      Once more upon the mountain's lonely height  I woke, and round me heard the sea-like sound  Of pine-woods, as the solemn night-wind washed  Through the long canyons and precipitous gorges  Where coyotes moaned and eagles made their nest.  Once more, far, far below, I saw the lights  Of distant cities, at the mountain's feet,  Clustered like constellations.. .  Over me, like the dome of some strange shrine,  Housing our great new weapon of the sky,  And moving on its axis like a moon  Glimmered the new Uraniborg.                               Shadows passed  Like monks, between it and the low grey walls  That lodged them, like a fortress in the rocks,  Their monastery of thought.                              A shadow neared me.  I heard, once more, an eager living voice:    \"Year after year, the slow sure records grow.  I wish that old Copernicus could see  How, through his truth, that once dispelled a dream,  Broke the false axle-trees of heaven, destroyed  All central certainty in the universe,  And seemed to dwarf mankind, the spirit of man  Laid hold on law, that Jacob's-ladder of light,  And mounting, slowly, surely, step by step,  Entered into its kingdom and its power.  For just as Tycho's tables of the stars  Within the bound of our own galaxy  Led Kepler to the music of his laws,  So, father and son, the Herschels, with their charts  Of all those fire-mists, those faint nebulae,  Those hosts of drifting universes, led  Our new discoverers to yet mightier laws  Enthroned above all worlds.                              We have not found them,  And yet--only the intellectual fool  Dreams in his heart that even his brain can tick  In isolated measure, a centre of law,  Amidst the whirl of universal chaos.  For law descends from law. Though all the spheres  Through all the abysmal depths of Space were blown  Like dust before a colder darker wind  Than even Lucretius dreamed, yet if one thought,  One gleam of law within the mind of man,  Lighten our darkness, there's a law beyond;  And even that tempest of destruction moves  To a lighter music, shatters its myriad worlds  Only to gather them up, as a shattered wave  Is gathered again into a rhythmic sea,  Whose ebb and flow are but the pulse of Life,  In its creative passion.                           The records grow  Unceasingly, and each new grain of truth  Is packed, like radium, with whole worlds of light.  The eclipses timed in Babylon help us now  To clock that gradual quickening of the moon,  Ten seconds in a century.                            Who that wrote  On those clay tablets could foresee his gift  To future ages; dreamed that the groping mind,  Dowered with so brief a life, could ever range  With that divine precision through the abyss?  Who, when that good Dutch spectacle-maker set  Two lenses in a tube, to read the time  Upon the distant clock-tower of his church,  Could dream of this, our hundred-inch, that shows  The snow upon the polar caps of Mars  Whitening and darkening as the seasons change?  Or who could dream when Galileo watched  His moons of Jupiter, that from their eclipses  And from that change in their appointed times,  Now late, now early, as the watching earth  Farther or nearer on its orbit rolled,  The immeasurable speed of light at last  Should be reduced to measure?                                Could Newton dream  When, through his prism, he broke the pure white shaft  Into that rainbow band, how men should gather  And disentangle ray by delicate ray  The colours of the stars,--not only those  That burn in heaven, but those that long since perished,  Those vanished suns that eyes can still behold,  The strange lost stars whose light still reaches earth  Although they died ten thousand years ago.  Here, night by night, the innumerable heavens  Speak to an eye more sensitive than man's,  Write on the camera's delicate retina  A thousand messages, lines of dark and bright  That speak of elements unknown on earth.  How shall men doubt, who thus can read the Book  Of Judgment, and transcend both Space and Time,  Analyse worlds that long since passed away,  And scan the future, how shall they doubt His power  From whom their power and all creation came?\"    I think that, when the second Herschel tried  Those great hexameters in our English tongue,  A nobler shield than ever Achilles knew  Shone through the song and made his  echoes live:    _\"There he depicted the earth, and the canopied sky, and the        sea-waves,  There the unwearied sun, and the full-orbed moon in their courses,  All the configured stars that gem the circuit of heaven,  Pleiads and Hyads were there and the giant force of Orion,  There the revolving Bear, which the Wain they call, was ensculptured,  Circling on high, and in all his courses regarding Orion,  Sole of the starry train that descends not to bathe in the ocean!\"_    A nobler shield for us, a deeper sky;  But even to us who know how far away  Those constellations burn, the wonder bides  That each vast sun can speed through the abyss  Age after age more swiftly than an eagle,  Each on its different road, alone like ours  With its own satellites; yet, since Homer sang,  Their aspect has not altered! All their flight  Has not yet changed the old pattern of the Wain.  The sword-belt of Orion is not sundered.  Nor has one fugitive splendour broken yet  From Cassiopeia's throne.                            A thousand years  Are but as yesterday, even unto these.  How shall men doubt His empery over time  Whose dwelling is a deep so absolute  That we can only find Him in our souls.  For there, despite Copernicus, each may find  The centre of all things. There He lives and reigns.  There infinite distance into nearness grows,  And infinite majesty stoops to dust again;  All things in little, infinite love in man . . .  Oh, beating wings, descend to earth once more,  And hear, reborn, the desert singer's cry:  _When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers,  The sun and the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained,  Though man be as dust I know Thou art"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#19)"],[1,"  and only real Greek, and such nonsense. But behold, my gold is turned to  ashes; my fame, after all, is little different from that enjoyed by a  conjuror._    Now I should like to give you an illustration from painting. The great  Zeuxis, after he had established his artistic supremacy, seldom or never  painted such common popular subjects as Heroes, Gods, and battle-pieces;  he was always intent on novelty; he would hit upon some extravagant and  strange design, and then use it to show his mastery of the art. One of  these daring pieces of his represented a female Centaur, nursing a pair  of infant Centaur twins. There is a copy of the picture now at Athens,  taken exactly from the original. The latter is said to have been put on  ship--board for Italy with the rest of Sulla's art treasures, and to have  been lost with them by the sinking of the ship, off Malea, I think it  was. The picture of the picture I have seen, and the best word-picture I  can manage of that I am now to give you; I am no connoisseur, you must  understand, but I have a vivid recollection of it as I saw it in an  Athenian studio not long ago; and my warm admiration of it as a work of  art may perhaps inspire me with a clear description.    On fresh green-sward appears the mother Centaur, the whole equine part of  her stretched on the ground, her hoofs extended backwards; the human part  is slightly raised on the elbows; the fore feet are not extended like the  others, for she is only partially on her side; one of them is bent as in  the act of kneeling, with the hoof tucked in, while the other is  beginning to straighten and take a hold on the ground--the action of a  horse rising. Of the cubs she is holding one in her arms suckling it in  the human fashion, while the other is drawing at the mare's dug like a  foal. In the upper part of the picture, as on higher ground, is a Centaur  who is clearly the husband of the nursing mother; he leans over laughing,  visible only down to the middle of his horse body; he holds a lion whelp  aloft in his right hand, terrifying the youngsters with it in sport.    There are no doubt qualities in the painting which evade analysis by a  mere amateur, and yet involve supreme craftsmanship--such things as  precision of line, perfect mastery of the palette, clever brush-work,  management of shadow, perspective, proportion, and relation of the parts  to the whole; but I leave all that to the professionals whose business it  is to appreciate it; what strikes _me_ especially about Zeuxis is  the manifold scope which he has found for his extraordinary skill, in a  single subject. You have in the husband a truly terrible savage creature;  his locks toss about, he is almost covered with hair, human part as well  as equine; the shoulders high to monstrosity; the look, even in his merry  mood, brutal, uncivilized, wild.    In contrast with him, the animal half of the female is lovely; a  Thessalian filly, yet unbroken and unbacked, might come nearest; and the  human upper half is also most beautiful, with the one exception of the  ears, which are pointed as in a satyr. At the point of junction which  blends the two natures, there is no sharp line of division, but the most  gradual of transitions; a touch here, a trait there, and you are  surprised to find the change complete. It was perfectly wonderful, again,  to see the combination of wildness and infancy, of terrible and tender,  in the young ones, looking up in baby curiosity at the lion-cub, while  they held on to breast and dug, and cuddled close to their dam.    Zeuxis imagined that when the picture was shown the technique of it would  take visitors by storm. Well, they did acclaim him; they could hardly  help that, with such a masterpiece before them; but their commendations  were all in the style of those given to me the other night; it was the  strangeness of the idea, the fresh unhackneyed sentiment of the picture,  and so on. Zeuxis saw that they were preoccupied with the novelty of his  subject, art was at a discount, and truth of rendering quite a minor  matter. 'Oh, pack it up, Miccio,' he said to his pupil, 'and you and the  others take it home; these people are delighted with the earthy part of  the work; the questions of its aim, its beauty, its artistic merit, are  of no importance whatever; novelty of subject goes for much more than  truth of rendering.'    So said Zeuxis, not in the best of tempers. Antiochus Soter had a  somewhat similar experience about his battle with the Galatians. If you  will allow me, I propose to give you an account of that event also. These  people were good fighters, and on this occasion in great force; they were  drawn up in a serried phalanx, the first rank, which consisted of steel-  clad warriors, being supported by men of the ordinary heavy-armed type to  the depth of four-and-twenty; twenty thousand cavalry held the flanks;  and there were eighty scythed, and twice that number of ordinary war  chariots ready to burst forth from the centre. These dispositions filled  Antiochus with apprehension, and he thought the task was too hard for  him. His own preparations had been hurried, on no great scale, and  inadequate to the occasion; he had brought quite a small force, mostly of  skirmishers and light-armed troops; more than half his men were without  defensive armour. He was disposed to negotiate and find some honourable  composition.    Theodotas of Rhodes, however, a brave and skilful officer, put him in  heart again. Antiochus had sixteen elephants; Theodotas advised him to  conceal these as well as he could for the present, not letting their  superior height betray them; when the signal for battle was given, the  shock just at hand, the enemy's cavalry charging, and their phalanx  opening to give free passage to the chariots, then would be the time for  the elephants. A section of four was to meet the cavalry on each flank,  and the remaining eight to engage the chariot squadron. 'By this means,'  he concluded, 'the horses will be frightened, and there will be a  stampede into the Galatian infantry.' His anticipations were realized,  thus:    Neither the Galatians nor their horses had ever seen an elephant, and  they were so taken aback by the strange sight that, long before the  beasts came to close quarters, the mere sound of their trumpeting, the  sight of their gleaming tusks relieved against dark bodies, and minatory  waving trunks, was enough; before they were within bow-shot, the enemy  broke and ran in utter disorder; the infantry were spitted on each  other's spears, and trampled by the cavalry who came scurrying on to  them. The chariots, turning in like manner upon their own friends,  whirled about among them by no means harmlessly; it was a Homeric scene  of 'rumbling tumbling cars'; when once the horses shied at those  formidable elephants, off went the drivers, and 'the lordless chariots  rattled on,' their scythes maiming and carving any of their late masters  whom they came within reach of; and, in that chaos, many were the  victims. Next came the elephants, trampling, tossing, tearing, goring;  and a very complete victory they had made of it for Antiochus.    The carnage was great, and all the Galatians were either killed or  captured, with the exception of a quite small band which got off to the  mountains; Antiochus's Macedonians sang the Paean, gathered round,  and garlanded him with acclamations on the glorious victory. But the  King--so the story goes--was in tears; 'My men,' he said, 'we have more  reason for shame; saved by those sixteen brutes! if their strangeness  had not produced the panic, where should we have been?' And on the  trophy he would have nothing carved except just an elephant.    Gentlemen, _de me fabula_; are my resources like those of Antiochus--  quite unfit for battle on the whole, but including some elephants, some  queer impositions, some jugglery, in fact? That is what all the praise I  hear points at. The things I really relied upon seem to be of little  account; the mere fact that my picture is of a female Centaur exercises  fascination; it passes for a novelty and a marvel, as indeed it is. The  rest of Zeuxis's pains is thrown away, I suppose. But ah, no, not thrown  away--; _you_ are connoisseurs, and judge by the rules of art. I  only hope the show may be worthy of the spectators.          HARMONIDES      'Tell me, Timotheus,' said Harmonides the flute-player one day to his  teacher, 'tell me how I may win distinction in my art. What can I do to  make myself known all over Greece? Everything but this you have taught  me. I have a correct ear, thanks to you, and a smooth, even delivery, and  have acquired the light touch so essential to the rendering of rapid  measures; rhythmical effect, the adaptation of music to dance, the true  character of the different moods--exalted Phrygian, joyous Lydian,  majestic Dorian, voluptuous Ionic--all these I have mastered with your  assistance. But the prime object of my musical aspirations seems out of  my reach: I mean popular esteem, distinction, and notoriety; I would have  all eyes turn in my direction, all tongues repeat my name: \"There goes  Harmonides, the great flute-player.\" Now when _you_ first came from  your home in Boeotia, and performed in the _Procne_, and won the  prize for your rendering of the _Ajax Furens_, composed by your  namesake, there was not a man who did not know the name of Timotheus of  Thebes; and in these days you have only to show yourself, and people  flock together as birds do at the sight of an owl in daylight. It is for  this that I sought to become a flute-player; this was to be the reward of  all my toil. The skill without the glory I would not take at a gift, not  though I should prove to be a Marsyas or an Olympus in disguise. What is  the use of a light that is to be hidden under a bushel? Show me then,  Timotheus, how I may avail myself of my powers and of my art. I shall be  "]]]
