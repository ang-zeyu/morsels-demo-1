It is said that the Jerusalem of  Christ's day is buried 20 feet under the surface, by the quiet  accretions of the dust of 1900 years. Rome also has been covered up in  recent centuries. It would be easy for 40 feet of sand to accumulate  over the bones of a modern man or chimpanzee in a valley, in a few  centuries, if 20 feet of dust accumulated on the mountain city of  Jerusalem in 1900 years.    Elsewhere we have shown that an ape-man with a cranium of two-thirds  normal capacity must have lived at least 20,000,000 years ago,--one  third the period of animal existence; or even 166,666,666 years ago,  if we accept a later claim that life has existed 500,000,000 years. It  is absolutely impossible that a normal creature of the alleged mental  capacity could have lived 750,000 years ago, much less 375,000,  according to a later estimate cutting in two the first one. But the  quickest way to disprove these wild guesses is to check them up by a  mathematical test. If these bones are normal, such an ape-man could  not have lived at the time assigned. If they are not normal, they  prove nothing whatever for evolution. They can be duplicated now.    We are asked to believe that these scattered bones,--some the bones of  a modern brute, some the bones of a modern man--were preserved in the  sand 750,000 years and belonged to an ancestor of the human race,  while of the millions of his generation and of the generations  following for many thousands of years, we have not a trace!  We are  asked upon such a flimsy pretext to accept a theory, unsupported by a  single compelling argument, and irreconcilable with numerous facts,--a  theory which takes away man's hope of immortality, destroys faith in  God and his inspired word, and in the Christian religion itself.  There is a limit. How much more truthful and majestic is Gen. 1:27:  \"And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he  him.\"    One distinguished evolutionist has said, \"We might as well be made out  of monkey as out of mud. It is mud or monkey.\" Most of us would  retort, \"I would rather be created a human being out of the filthiest  mud by Almighty God than owe my existence to the brainiest monkey that  ever lived.\" Please note, \"The Lord God formed man of the _dust_  of the ground,\" not _mud_. The evolutionists are as wild in their  exegesis as in their guesses.    2. THE HEIDELBERG JAW. The second relic, in the order of time,  relied upon by the evolutionists to prove the brute origin of man, is  a \"human jaw of great antiquity, discovered in the _sands_ of the  Mauer River, near Heidelberg.\"  Hence, it is called the Mauer jaw, or  the Heidelberg Jaw, or Heidelberg man, or the high sounding Latin name  of Homo Heidelbergensis. It needs all the names that can be given to  it, to elevate it to the dignity of an ancestor. \"This jaw was found  in undisturbed stratified _sand_, (sand again) at the depth of  about 69 feet from the summit of the deposit.\" Dr. Schoetensack, the  discoverer, says, \"Had the teeth been absent, it would have been  impossible to diagnose it as human.\"    They say it is 700,000 years old, preserved in sand.  A later estimate  says 375,000 years. (Any wild guess will do.) It resembles the jaw of  an ape, and the tooth of a man. Was it not likely the abnormal jaw of  a modern man, in historic time swept into the sands by the freshets  and floods of a few centuries? It is only fair to say that many  scientists of the evolutionary school, do not believe the Heidelberg  man an ancestor of our race. \"These remains,\" says one, \"show no trace  of being intermediate between man and the anthropoid ape.\" Some claim  it a connecting link. Others deny it. Some say the find is of the  utmost value; others say it is worthless. All are guesses, wild  guesses at that. They hopefully reach out their hands in the night,  and gather nothing but handfuls of darkness.    Since a modern Eskimo skull has been shown by a distinguished  scientist to have the same appearance and peculiarities as the  Heidelberg jaw, it is easy to believe that this jaw can be duplicated  in many graveyards. Greater abnormalities, in great numbers, can be  found in the skeletons of modern man. Without doubt, this jaw belongs  to modern man, and has no evidential value at all in favor of  evolution.    We count these relics normal, in our arguments, because evolutionists  do. If they are not normal, they are the remains of modern man and  brutes and their whole argument falls to the ground.    3. THE PILTDOWN MAN (OR FAKE). The next fragments of bones, in  chronological order, upon which evolutionists rely to prove their  impossible theory, has been called the Piltdown man. It has been more  truthfully called the Piltdown fake. Dr. Chapin gravely tells us  (Social Evolution, p. 67): \"During the years 1912, a series of  fragments of a human skull and a jaw bone were found associated with  eolithic implements and the bones of extinct mammals in Pleistocene  deposits on a plateau, 80 feet above the river bed, at Piltdown,  Fletching, Sussex, Eng.....The remains were of great importance. The  discoverers regard this relic as a specimen of a distinct genus of the  human species and it has been called Eoanthropus Dawsoni. This extinct  man lived in Europe hundreds of thousands of years ago.\" We have  passed over 200,000 to 300,000 years since the Heidelberg man, that  have not yielded a scrap of bone, though according to the theory,  countless millions of ape-men must have lived in various stages of  development, in that great stretch of time. Why were not some of them  preserved? Simply because there were no ape-men. There are countless  relics of apes, but none of ape-men. Even Wells says: \"At a great  open-air camp at Solutre, where they seem to have had annual  gatherings for many centuries, it is estimated there are the bones of  100,000 horses.\" Would we not expect as many bones of ape-men? While  Wells says the bones of 100,000 horses were found in a single  locality, Dr. Ales Hrdlicka says that the bones of 200,000 prehistoric  horses were found in another place. Why should we not find, for the  same reason, the bones of millions of ape-men and ape-women in 750,000  years? Instead of millions we have the alleged fragments of 4, all of  which are of a very doubtful character.    The bones of this precious Piltdown find consisted, at first, of a  _piece of the jaw bone, another small piece of bone from the  skull_, and a canine tooth, which the zealous evolutionists located  in the lower right jaw, when it belonged in the upper left; later, two  molar teeth and two nasal bones,--scarcely a double hand full in  all. An ape-man was \"reconstructed\" made to look like an ape-man,  according to the fancy of the artist. The artist can create an  ape-man, even if God could not create a real man! But scientists said  the teeth did not belong to the same skull, and the jaw could not be  associated with the same skull.  Ales Hrdlicka says, \"The jaw and the  tooth belong to a fossil chimpanzee.\" Conscientious scientists said  that the pieces of the jaw and skull could not belong to the same  individual. They constructed a scarecrow from the bones of an ape and  of a man, and offer this, without the batting of an eye, as a  scientific proof of the antiquity of man.  The great anthropologist of  world-wide reputation, Prof.  Virchow, said: \"In vain have Darwin's  adherents sought for connecting links which should connect man with  the monkey. _Not a single one has been found_. This so-called  pro-anthropus, which is supposed to represent this connecting link,  has not appeared. No true scientist claims to have seen him.\" Sir Ray  Lancaster, writing to H. G.  Wells, concerning the Piltdown find,  says, \"We are stumped and baffled.\" Yet in spite of all this, nearly  1,000,000 persons annually pass through the American Museum of Natural  History in New York, and view the \"reconstruction\" according to the  artist's fancy, of the pithecanthropus, the Heidelberg man, the  Piltdown man, and the Neanderthal man, the \"ancestors of the human  race;\" and the multitude of high school students and teachers, as well  as the general public, are not told how dubious and unscientific the  representation is.    The brain capacity of the Piltdown individual (man or ape) is set down  by his discoverers at 1070 c.c., which is 28 2/3% short of the normal  skull capacity, 1500 c.c.  Therefore, he must have lived 17,200,000  years ago, if we accept the estimate of 60,000,000 years since life  began; or 143,333,333 years ago, if we accept the later guess of  500,000,000 years. It could not have lived near the time assigned.  In  short, no guess of the origin of man that differs materially from the  time assigned in the word of God, can be harmonized with the facts.    4. THE NEANDERTHAL MAN. The next slender prop is the  Neanderthal man, claimed to be 40,000 to 50,000 years old, although we  are told that that is very uncertain.    Dr. Chapin says, \"The first important discovery of the existence of an  early example of mankind differing markedly from any living (?) and of  a decidedly lower type, was made in 1857, when a part of a skull was  found in a cave near Dusseldorf, Germany. The bones consisted of the  upper portion of a cranium, remarkable for its flat retreating curve,  the upper arm and thigh bones, a collar bone, and rib fragments.\" From  these fragments, an ape-man has been created (by the artist), about 5  ft. 3 in.  high, strong, fierce in look, and having other  characteristics created by the artist.    Dr. Osborn assigns to the Neanderthal skull a capacity of 1408 c.c.,  which would indicate that he lived 3,680,000 years ago, if life began  60,000,000 years ago; or 30,666,666 years ago, if life began  500,000,000 years ago.    From the first, many naturalists claimed that these bones belonged to  an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#19)"],[1,"nfancy, youth, adult life,--all stand on the same educative level  in the sense that what is really learned at any and every stage of  experience constitutes the value of that experience, and in the sense  that it is the chief business of life at every point to make living thus  contribute to an enrichment of its own perceptible meaning.    We thus reach a technical definition of education: It is that  reconstruction or reorganization of experience which adds to the meaning  of experience, and which increases ability to direct the course of  subsequent experience. (1) The increment of meaning corresponds to  the increased perception of the connections and continuities of the  activities in which we are engaged. The activity begins in an impulsive  form; that is, it is blind. It does not know what it is about; that is  to say, what are its interactions with other activities. An activity  which brings education or instruction with it makes one aware of some  of the connections which had been imperceptible. To recur to our simple  example, a child who reaches for a bright light gets burned. Henceforth  he knows that a certain act of touching in connection with a certain  act of vision (and vice-versa) means heat and pain; or, a certain  light means a source of heat. The acts by which a scientific man in his  laboratory learns more about flame differ no whit in principle. By doing  certain things, he makes perceptible certain connections of heat with  other things, which had been previously ignored. Thus his acts in  relation to these things get more meaning; he knows better what he  is doing or \"is about\" when he has to do with them; he can intend  consequences instead of just letting them happen--all synonymous ways  of saying the same thing. At the same stroke, the flame has gained in  meaning; all that is known about combustion, oxidation, about light and  temperature, may become an intrinsic part of its intellectual content.    (2) The other side of an educative experience is an added power of  subsequent direction or control. To say that one knows what he is about,  or can intend certain consequences, is to say, of course, that he can  better anticipate what is going to happen; that he can, therefore, get  ready or prepare in advance so as to secure beneficial consequences and  avert undesirable ones. A genuinely educative experience, then, one  in which instruction is conveyed and ability increased, is  contradistinguished from a routine activity on one hand, and a  capricious activity on the other. (a) In the latter one \"does not  care what happens\"; one just lets himself go and avoids connecting the  consequences of one's act (the evidences of its connections with other  things) with the act. It is customary to frown upon such aimless  random activity, treating it as willful mischief or carelessness or  lawlessness. But there is a tendency to seek the cause of such aimless  activities in the youth's own disposition, isolated from everything  else. But in fact such activity is explosive, and due to maladjustment  with surroundings. Individuals act capriciously whenever they act under  external dictation, or from being told, without having a purpose of  their own or perceiving the bearing of the deed upon other acts. One may  learn by doing something which he does not understand; even in the most  intelligent action, we do much which we do not mean, because the largest  portion of the connections of the act we consciously intend are not  perceived or anticipated. But we learn only because after the act is  performed we note results which we had not noted before. But much work  in school consists in setting up rules by which pupils are to act of  such a sort that even after pupils have acted, they are not led to  see the connection between the result--say the answer--and the method  pursued. So far as they are concerned, the whole thing is a trick and  a kind of miracle. Such action is essentially capricious, and leads to  capricious habits. (b) Routine action, action which is automatic, may  increase skill to do a particular thing. In so far, it might be said  to have an educative effect. But it does not lead to new perceptions  of bearings and connections; it limits rather than widens the  meaning-horizon. And since the environment changes and our way of acting  has to be modified in order successfully to keep a balanced connection  with things, an isolated uniform way of acting becomes disastrous at  some critical moment. The vaunted \"skill\" turns out gross ineptitude.    The essential contrast of the idea of education as continuous  reconstruction with the other one-sided conceptions which have been  criticized in this and the previous chapter is that it identifies the  end (the result) and the process. This is verbally self-contradictory,  but only verbally. It means that experience as an active process  occupies time and that its later period completes its earlier portion;  it brings to light connections involved, but hitherto unperceived.  The later outcome thus reveals the meaning of the earlier, while the  experience as a whole establishes a bent or disposition toward the  things possessing this meaning. Every such continuous experience  or activity is educative, and all education resides in having such  experiences.    It remains only to point out (what will receive more ample attention  later) that the reconstruction of experience may be social as well as  personal. For purposes of simplification we have spoken in the earlier  chapters somewhat as if the education of the immature which fills them  with the spirit of the social group to which they belong, were a sort of  catching up of the child with the aptitudes and resources of the adult  group. In static societies, societies which make the maintenance of  established custom their measure of value, this conception applies in  the main. But not in progressive communities. They endeavor to shape the  experiences of the young so that instead of reproducing current habits,  better habits shall be formed, and thus the future adult society be  an improvement on their own. Men have long had some intimation of the  extent to which education may be consciously used to eliminate obvious  social evils through starting the young on paths which shall not produce  these ills, and some idea of the extent in which education may be made  an instrument of realizing the better hopes of men. But we are doubtless  far from realizing the potential efficacy of education as a constructive  agency of improving society, from realizing that it represents not only  a development of children and youth but also of the future society of  which they will be the constituents.    Summary. Education may be conceived either retrospectively or  prospectively. That is to say, it may be treated as process of  accommodating the future to the past, or as an utilization of the past  for a resource in a developing future. The former finds its standards  and patterns in what has gone before. The mind may be regarded as a  group of contents resulting from having certain things presented. In  this case, the earlier presentations constitute the material to which  the later are to be assimilated. Emphasis upon the value of the early  experiences of immature beings is most important, especially because of  the tendency to regard them as of little account. But these experiences  do not consist of externally presented material, but of interaction of  native activities with the environment which progressively modifies both  the activities and the environment. The defect of the Herbartian theory  of formation through presentations consists in slighting this constant  interaction and change. The same principle of criticism applies to  theories which find the primary subject matter of study in the cultural  products--especially the literary products--of man's history. Isolated  from their connection with the present environment in which individuals  have to act, they become a kind of rival and distracting environment.  Their value lies in their use to increase the meaning of the things with  which we have actively to do at the present time. The idea of education  advanced in these chapters is formally summed up in the idea of  continuous reconstruction of experience, an idea which is marked off  from education as preparation for a remote future, as unfolding, as  external formation, and as recapitulation of the past.          Chapter Seven: The Democratic Conception in Education    For the most part, save incidentally, we have hitherto been concerned  with education as it may exist in any social group. We have now to  make explicit the differences in the spirit, material, and method of  education as it operates in different types of community life. To say  that education is a social function, securing direction and development  in the immature through their participation in the life of the group to  which they belong, is to say in effect that education will vary with the  quality of life which prevails in a group. Particularly is it true that  a society which not only changes but-which has the ideal of such  change as will improve it, will have different standards and methods  of education from one which aims simply at the perpetuation of its  own customs. To make the general ideas set forth applicable to our own  educational practice, it is, therefore, necessary to come to closer  quarters with the nature of present social life.    1. The Implications of Human Association. Society is one word, but many  things. Men associate together in all kinds of ways and for all kinds  of purposes. One man is concerned in a multitude of diverse groups, in  which his associates may be quite different. It often seems as if they  had nothing in common except that they are modes of associated life.  Within every larger social organization there are numerous minor groups:  not only political subdivisions, but"]]]
