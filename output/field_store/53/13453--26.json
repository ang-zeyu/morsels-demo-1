And Kurt's my first name,\" was the reply.    \"Will this farm fall to you?\"    \"Yes, if my father does not lose it.\"    \"Hum!... Old Dorn won't lose it, never fear. He raises the best wheat in  this section.\"    \"But father never owned the land. We have had three bad years. If the  wheat fails this summer--we lose the land, that's all.\"    \"Are you an--American?\" queried Anderson, slowly, as if treading on  dangerous ground.    \"I am,\" snapped Kurt. \"My mother was American. She's dead. Father is  German. He's old. He's rabid since the President declared war. He'll  never change.\"    \"That's hell. What 're you goin' to do if your country calls you?\"    \"Go!\" replied Kurt, with flashing eyes. \"I wanted to enlist. Father and  I quarreled over that until I had to give in. He's hard--he's  impossible.... I'll wait for the draft and hope I'm called.\"    \"Boy, it's that spirit Germany's roused, an' the best I can say is, God  help her!... Have you a brother?\"    \"No. I'm all father has.\"    \"Well, it makes a tough place for him, an' you, too. Humor him. He's  old. An' when you're called--go an' fight. You'll come back.\"    \"If I only knew that--it wouldn't be so hard.\"    \"Hard? It sure is hard. But it'll be the makin' of a great country.  It'll weed out the riffraff.... See here, Kurt, I'm goin' to give you a  hunch. Have you had any dealin's with the I.W.W.?\"    \"Yes, last harvest we had trouble, but nothing serious. When I was in  Spokane last month I heard a good deal. Strangers have approached us  here, too--mostly aliens. I have no use for them, but they always get  father's ear. And now!... To tell the truth, I'm worried.\"    \"Boy, you need to be,\" replied Anderson, earnestly. \"We're all worried.  I'm goin' to let you read over the laws of that I.W.W. organization.  You're to keep mum now, mind you. I belong to the Chamber of Commerce in  Spokane. Somebody got hold of these by-laws of this so-called labor  union. We've had copies made, an' every honest farmer in the Northwest  is goin' to read them. But carryin' one around is dangerous, I reckon,  these days. Here.\"    Anderson hesitated a moment, peered cautiously around, and then,  slipping folded sheets of paper from his inside coat pocket, he  evidently made ready to hand them to Kurt.    \"Lenore, where's the driver?\" he asked.    \"He's under the car,\" replied the girl    Kurt thrilled at the soft sound of her voice. It was something to have  been haunted by a girl's face for a year and then suddenly hear her  voice.    \"He's new to me--that driver--an' I ain't trustin' any new men these  days,\" went on Anderson. \"Here now, Dorn. Read that. An' if you don't  get red-headed--\"    Without finishing his last muttered remark, he opened the sheets of  manuscript and spread them out to the young man.    Curiously, and with a little rush of excitement, Kurt began to read. The  very first rule of the I.W.W. aimed to abolish capital. Kurt read on  with slowly growing amaze, consternation, and anger. When he had  finished, his look, without speech, was a question Anderson hastened to  answer.    \"It's straight goods,\" he declared. \"Them's the sure-enough rules of  that gang. We made certain before we acted. Now how do they strike you?\"    \"Why, that's no labor union!\" replied Kurt, hotly. \"They're outlaws,  thieves, blackmailers, pirates. I--I don't know what!\"    \"Dorn, we're up against a bad outfit an' the Northwest will see hell  this summer. There's trouble in Montana and Idaho. Strangers are  driftin' into Washington from all over. We must organize to meet  them--to prevent them gettin' a hold out here. It's a labor union,  mostly aliens, with dishonest an' unscrupulous leaders, some of them  Americans. They aim to take advantage of the war situation. In the  newspapers they rave about shorter hours, more pay, acknowledgment of  the union. But any fool would see, if he read them laws I showed you,  that this I.W.W. is not straight.\"    \"Mr. Anderson, what steps have you taken down in your country?\" queried  Kurt.    \"So far all I've done was to hire my hands for a year, give them high  wages, an' caution them when strangers come round to feed them an' be  civil an' send them on.\"    \"But we can't do that up here in the Bend,\" said Dorn, seriously. \"We  need, say, a hundred thousand men in harvest-time, and not ten thousand  all the rest of the year.\"    \"Sure you can't. But you'll have to organize somethin'. Up here in this  desert you could have a heap of trouble if that outfit got here strong  enough. You'd better tell every farmer you can trust about this I.W.W.\"    \"I've only one American neighbor, and he lives six miles from here,\"  replied Dorn. \"Olsen over there is a Swede, and not a naturalized  citizen, but I believe he's for the U.S. And there's--\"    \"Dad,\" interrupted the girl, \"I believe our driver is listening to your  very uninteresting conversation.\"    She spoke demurely, with laughter in her low voice. It made Dorn dare to  look at her, and he met a blue blaze that was instantly averted.    Anderson growled, evidently some very hard names, under his breath; his  look just then was full of characteristic Western spirit. Then he got  up.    \"Lenore, I reckon your talk 'll be more interesting than mine,\" he said,  dryly. \"I'll go see Dorn an' get this business over.\"    \"I'd rather go with you,\" hurriedly replied Kurt; and then, as though  realizing a seeming discourtesy in his words, his face flamed, and he  stammered: \"I--I don't mean that. But father is in bad mood. We just  quarreled.--I told you--about the war. And--Mr. Anderson,--I'm--I'm a  little afraid he'll--\"    \"Well, son, I'm not afraid,\" interrupted the rancher. \"I'll beard the  old lion in his den. You talk to Lenore.\"    \"Please don't speak of the war,\" said Kurt, appealingly.    \"Not a word unless he starts roarin' at Uncle Sam,\" declared Anderson,  with a twinkle in his eyes, and turned toward the house.    \"He'll roar, all right,\" said Kurt, almost with a groan. He knew what an  ordeal awaited the rancher, and he hated the fact that it could not be  avoided. Then Kurt was confused, astounded, infuriated with himself over  a situation he had not brought about and could scarcely realize. He  became conscious of pride and shame, and something as black and hopeless  as despair.    \"Haven't I seen you--before?\" asked the girl.    The query surprised and thrilled Kurt out of his self-centered thought.    \"I don't know. Have you? Where?\" he answered, facing her. It was a  relief to find that she still averted her face.    \"At Berkeley, in California, the first time, and the second at Spokane,  in front of the Davenport,\" she replied.    \"First--and--second?... You--you remembered both times!\" he burst out,  incredulously.    \"Yes. I don't see how I could have helped remembering.\" Her laugh was  low, musical, a little hurried, yet cool.    Dorn was not familiar with girls. He had worked hard all his life, there  among those desert hills, and during the few years his father had  allowed him for education. He knew wheat, but nothing of the eternal  feminine. So it was impossible for him to grasp that this girl was not  wholly at her ease. Her words and the cool little laugh suddenly brought  home to Kurt the immeasurable distance between him and a daughter of one  of the richest ranchers in Washington.    \"You mean I--I was impertinent,\" he began, struggling between shame and  pride. \"I--I stared at you.... Oh, I must have been rude.... But, Miss  Anderson, I--I didn't mean to be. I didn't think you saw me--at all. I  don't know what made me do that. It never happened before. I beg your  pardon.\"    A subtle indefinable change, perceptible to Dorn, even in his confused  state, came over the girl.    \"I did not say you were impertinent,\" she returned. \"I remembered seeing  you--notice me, that is all.\"    Self-possessed, aloof, and kind, Miss Anderson now became an  impenetrable mystery to Dorn. But that only accentuated the distance she  had intimated lay between them. Her kindness stung him to recover his  composure. He wished she had not been kind. What a singular chance that  had brought her here to his home--the daughter of a man who came to  demand a long-unpaid debt! What a dispelling of the vague thing that had  been only a dream! Dorn gazed away across the yellowing hills to the dim  blue of the mountains where rolled the Oregon. Despite the color, it was  gray--like his future.    \"I heard you tell father you had studied wheat,\" said the girl,  presently, evidently trying to make conversation.    \"Yes, all my life,\" replied Kurt. \"My study has mostly been under my  father. Look at my hands.\" He held out big, strong hands, scarred and  knotted, with horny palms uppermost, and he laughed. \"I can be proud of  them, Miss Anderson.... But I had a splendid year in California at the  university and I graduated from the Washington State Agricultural  College.\"    \"You love wheat--the raising of it, I mean?\" she inquired.    \"It must be that I do, though I never had such a thought. Wheat is so  wonderful. No one can guess who does not know it!... The clean, plump  grain, the sowing on fallow ground, the long wait, the first tender  green, and the change day by day to the deep waving fields of gold--then  the harvest, hot, noisy, smoky, full of dust and chaff, and the great  combine-harvesters with thirty-four horses. Oh! I guess I do love it  all.... I worked in a Spokane flour-mill, too, just to learn how flour  is made. There is nothing in the world so white, so clean, so pure as  flour made from the wheat of these hills!\"    \"Next you'll be telling me that you can bake bread,\" she rejoined, and  her laugh was low and sweet. Her eyes shone with soft blue gleams.    \"Indeed I can! I bake all the bread we use,\" he said, stoutly. \"And I  flatter myself I can beat any girl you know.\"    \"You can beat "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#2)"],[1,"ies, some of the finest in the world, seem   ruined for ever:  and all because men will not learn nor obey those   physical laws of the universe, which (whether we be conscious of them   or not) are all around us, like walls of iron and of adamant--say   rather, like some vast machine, ruthless though beneficent, among the   wheels of which if we entangle ourselves in our rash ignorance, they   will not stop to set us free, but crush us, as they have crushed   whole nations and whole races ere now, to powder.  Very terrible,   though very calm, is outraged Nature.      Though the mills of God grind slowly,     Yet they grind exceeding small;  Though He sit, and wait with patience,     With exactness grinds He all.      It is, I believe, one of the most hopeful among the many hopeful   signs of the times, that the civilised nations of Europe and America   are awakening slowly but surely to this truth.  The civilised world   is learning, thank God, more and more of the importance of physical   science; year by year, thank God, it is learning to live more and   more according to those laws of physical science, which are, as the   great Lord Bacon said of old, none other than \"Vox Dei in rebus   revelata\"--the Word of God revealed in facts; and it is gaining by so   doing, year by year, more and more of health and wealth; of peaceful   and comfortable, even of graceful and elevating, means of life for   fresh millions.    If you want to know what the study of physical science has done for   man, look, as a single instance, at the science of Sanatory Reform;   the science which does not merely try to cure disease, and shut the   stable-door after the horse is stolen, but tries to prevent disease;   and, thank God! is succeeding beyond our highest expectations.  Or   look at the actual fresh amount of employment, of subsistence, which   science has, during the last century, given to men; and judge for   yourselves whether the study of it be not one worthy of those who   wish to help themselves, and, in so doing, to help their fellow-men.    Let me quote to you a passage from an essay urging the institution of   schools of physical science for artisans, which says all I wish to   say and more:    \"The discoveries of Voltaic electricity, electromagnetism, and   magnetic electricity, by Volta, OErsted, and Faraday, led to the   invention of electric telegraphy by Wheatstone and others, and to the   great manufactures of telegraph cables and telegraph wire, and of the   materials required for them.  The value of the cargo of the Great   Eastern alone in the recent Bombay telegraph expedition was   calculated at three millions of pounds sterling.  It also led to the   employment of thousands of operators to transmit the telegraphic   messages, and to a great increase of our commerce in nearly all its   branches by the more rapid means of communication.  The discovery of   Voltaic electricity further led to the invention of electro-plating,   and to the employment of a large number of persons in that business.    The numerous experimental researches on specific heat, latent heat,   the tension of vapours, the properties of water, the mechanical   effect of heat, etc., resulted in the development of steam-engines,   and railways, and the almost endless employments depending upon their   construction and use.  About a quarter of a million of persons are   employed on railways alone in Great Britain.  The various original   investigations on the chemical effects of light led to the invention   of photography, and have given employment to thousands of persons who   practise that process, or manufacture and prepare the various   material and articles required in it.  The discovery of chlorine by   Scheele led to the invention of the modern processes of bleaching,   and to various improvements in the dyeing of the textile fabrics, and   has given employment to a very large number of our Lancashire   operatives.  The discovery of chlorine has also contributed to the   employment of thousands of printers, by enabling Esparto grass to be   bleached and formed into paper for the use of our daily press.  The   numerous experimental investigations in relation to coal-gas have   been the means of extending the use of that substance, and of   increasing the employment of workmen and others connected with its   manufacture.  The discovery of the alkaline metals by Davy, of   cyanide of potassium, of nickel, phosphorus, the common acids, and a   multitude of other substances, has led to the employment of a whole   army of workmen in the conversion of those substances into articles   of utility.  The foregoing examples might be greatly enlarged upon,   and a great many others might be selected from the sciences of   physics and chemistry:  but those mentioned will suffice.  There is   not a force of Nature, nor scarcely a material substance that we   employ, which has not been the subject of several, and in some cases   of numerous, original experimental researches, many of which have   resulted, in a greater or less degree, in increasing the employment   for workmen and others.\" {1}    \"All this may be very true.  But of what practical use will physical   science be to me?\"    Let me ask in return:  Are none of you going to emigrate?  If you   have courage and wisdom, emigrate you will, some of you, instead of   stopping here to scramble over each other's backs for the scraps,   like black-beetles in a kitchen.  And if you emigrate, you will soon   find out, if you have eyes and common sense, that the vegetable   wealth of the world is no more exhausted than its mineral wealth.    Exhausted?  Not half of it--I believe not a tenth of it--is yet   known.  Could I show you the wealth which I have seen in a single   Tropic island, not sixty miles square--precious timbers, gums,   fruits, what not, enough to give employment and wealth to thousands   and tens of thousands, wasting for want of being known and worked--  then you would see what a man who emigrates may do, by a little sound   knowledge of botany alone.    And if not.  Suppose that any one of you, learning a little sound   Natural History, should abide here in Britain to your life's end, and   observe nothing but the hedgerow plants, he would find that there is   much more to be seen in those mere hedgerow plants than he fancies   now.  The microscope will reveal to him in the tissues of any wood,   of any seed, wonders which will first amuse him, then puzzle him, and   at last (I hope) awe him, as he perceives that smallness of size   interferes in no way with perfection of development, and that   \"Nature,\" as has been well said, \"is greatest in that which is   least.\"  And more.  Suppose that he went further still.  Suppose that   he extended his researches somewhat to those minuter vegetable forms,   the mosses, fungi, lichens; suppose that he went a little further   still, and tried what the microscope would show him in any stagnant   pool, whether fresh water or salt, of Desmidiae, Diatoms, and all   those wondrous atomies which seem as yet to defy our classification   into plants or animals.  Suppose he learnt something of this, but   nothing of aught else.  Would he have gained no solid wisdom?  He   would be a stupider man than I have a right to believe any of my   readers to be, if he had not gained thereby somewhat of the most   valuable of treasures--namely, that inductive habit of mind, that   power of judging fairly of facts, without which no good or lasting   work will be done, whether in physical science, in social science, in   politics, in philosophy, in philology, or in history.    But more:  let me urge you to study Natural Science, on grounds which   may be to you new and unexpected--on social, I had almost said on   political, grounds.    We all know, and I trust we all love, the names of Liberty, Equality,   and Brotherhood.  We feel, I trust, that these words are too   beautiful not to represent true and just ideas; and that therefore   they will come true, and be fulfilled, somewhen, somewhere, somehow.    It may be in a shape very different from that which you, or I, or any   man expects; but still they will be fulfilled.    But if they are to come true, it is we, the individual men, who must   help them to come true for the whole world, by practising them   ourselves, when and where we can.  And I tell you--that in becoming   scientific men, in studying science and acquiring the scientific   habit of mind, you will find yourselves enjoying a freedom, an   equality, a brotherhood, such as you will not find elsewhere just   now.    Freedom:  what do we want freedom for?  For this, at least; that we   may be each and all able to think what we choose; and to say what we   choose also, provided we do not say it rudely or violently, so as to   provoke a breach of the peace.  That last was Mr. Buckle's definition   of freedom of speech.  That was the only limit to it which he would   allow; and I think that that is Mr. John Stuart Mill's limit also.    It is mine.  And I think we have that kind of freedom in these   islands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth.    But what I complain of is, that when men have got the freedom, three   out of four of them will not use it.  What?--someone will answer--Do   you suppose that I will not say what I choose, and that I dare not   speak my own mind to any man?  Doubtless.  But are you sure first,   that you think what you choose, or only what someone else chooses for   you?  Are you sure that you make up your own mind before you speak,   or let someone else make it up for you?  Your speech may be free   enough, my good friend; and Heaven forbid that it should be anything   else:  but are your thoughts free likewise?  Are you sure that,   though you may hate bigotry in others, you are not somewhat of a   bigot yourself?  That you do not look at only one side of a question,   and that the one which"]]]
