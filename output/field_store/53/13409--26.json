Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,", we  say to those, who to solve difficulties far above their reach, pretend  that the human species descended from a first man and a first woman,  created diversely according to different creeds;--that we have some  ideas of Nature, but that we have none of creation;--that the human mind  is incapable of comprehending the period when all was nothing;--that to  use words we cannot understand, is only in other terms to acknowledge  our ignorance of the powers of Nature;--that we are unable to fathom  the means by which she has been capacitated to produce the phenomena we  behold.    Let us then conclude, that man has no just, no solid reason to believe  himself a privileged being in Nature; because he is subject to the same  vicissitudes, as all her other productions. His pretended prerogatives  have their foundation in error, arising from mistaken opinions  concerning his existence. Let him but elevate himself by his thoughts  above the globe he inhabits, he will look upon his own species with  the same eyes he does all other beings in Nature: He will then clearly  perceive that in the same manner that each tree produces its fruit, by  reason of its energies, in consequence of its species: so each man acts  by reason of his particular energy; that he produces fruit, actions,  works, equally necessary: he will feel that the illusion which he  anticipates in favour of himself, arises from his being, at one and the  same time, a spectator and a part of the universe. He will acknowledge,  that the idea of excellence which he attaches to his being, has no other  foundation than his own peculiar interest; than the predilection he  has in favour of himself--that the doctrine he has broached with such  seeming confidence, bottoms itself on a very suspicious foundation,  namely IGNORANCE and SELF-LOVE.            CHAP. VII.    _The Soul and the Spiritual System_.      Man, after having gratuitously supposed himself composed of two distinct  independent substances, that have no common properties, relatively with  each other; has pretended, as we have seen, that that which actuated him  interiorly, that motion which is invisible, that impulse which is  placed within himself, is essentially different from those which act  exteriorly. The first he designated, as we have already said, by the  name of a SPIRIT or a SOUL. If however it be asked, what is a spirit?  The moderns will reply, that the whole fruit of their metaphysical  researches is limited to learning that this motive-power, which they  state to be the spring of man's action, is a substance of an unknown  nature; so simple, so indivisible, so deprived of extent, so invisible,  so impossible to be discovered by the senses, that its parts cannot be  separated, even by abstraction or thought. The question then arises, how  can we conceive such a substance, which is only the negation of every  thing of which we have a knowledge? How form to ourselves an idea of a  substance, void of extent, yet acting on our senses; that is to say,  on those organs which are material, which have extent? How can a  being without extent be moveable; how put matter in action? How can a  substance devoid of parts, correspond successively with different parts  of space? But a very cogent question presents itself on this occasion:  if this distinct substance that is said to form one of the component  parts of man, be really what it is reported, and if it be not, it is  not what it is described; if it be unknown, if it be not pervious to  the senses; if it be invisible, by what means did the metaphysicians  themselves become acquainted with it? How did they form ideas of a  substance, that taking their own account of it, is not, under any of its  circumstances, either directly or by analogy, cognizable to the mind of  man? If they could positively achieve this, there would no longer be any  mystery in Nature: it would be as easy to conceive the time when all was  nothing, when all shall have passed away, to account for the  production of every thing we behold, as to dig in a garden or read a  lecture.--Doubt would vanish from the human species; there could no  longer be any difference of opinion, since all must necessarily be of  one mind on a subject so accessible to every enquirer.    But it will be replied, the materialist himself admits, the natural  philosophers of all ages have admitted, elements and atoms, beings  simple and indivisible, of which bodies are composed:--granted; they  have no more: they have also admitted that many of these atoms, many  of these elements, if not all, are unknown to them: nevertheless, these  simple beings, these atoms of the materialist, are not the same thing  with the spirit, or the soul of the metaphysician. When the natural  philosopher talks of atoms--when he describes them as simple beings,  he indicates nothing more than that they are homogeneous, pure, without  mixture: but then he allows that they have extent, consequently parts,  are separable by thought, although no other natural agent with which  he is acquainted is capable of dividing them: that the simple beings  of this genus are susceptible of motion--can impart action--receive  impulse--are material--are placed in Nature--are indestructible;--that  consequently, if he cannot know them from themselves, he can form some  idea of them by analogy: thus he has done that intelligibly, which the  metaphysician would do unintelligibly: the latter, with a view to render  man immortal, finding difficulties to his wish, from seeing that  the body decayed--that it has submitted to the great, the universal  law--has, to solve the difficulty, to remove the impediment, given him a  soul, distinct from the body, which he says is exempted from the action  of the general law: to account for this, he has called it a spiritual  being, whose properties are the negation of all known properties,  consequently inconceivable: had he, however, had recourse to the atoms  of the former--had he made this substance the last possible term of the  division of matter--it would at least have been intelligible; it would  also have been immortal, since, according to the reasonings of all men,  whether metaphysicians, theologians, or natural philosophers, an atom is  an indestructible element, that must exist to all eternity.    All men are agreed in this position, that motion is the successive  change of the relations of one body with other bodies, or with  the different parts of space. If that which is called _spirit_ be  susceptible of communicating or receiving motion--if it acts--if  it gives play to the organs of body--to produce these effects, it  necessarily follows that this being changes successively its relation,  its tendency, its correspondence, the position of its parts, either  relatively to the different points of space, or to the different organs  of the body which it puts in action: but to change its relation  with space, with the organs to which it gives impulse, it follows of  necessity that this spirit most have extent, solidity, consequently  distinct parts: whenever a substance possesses these qualities, it  is what we call MATTER, it can no longer be regarded as a simple pure  being, in the sense attached to it by the moderns, or by theologians.    Thus it will be seen, that those who, to conquer insurmountable  difficulties, have supposed in man an immaterial substance,  distinguished from his body, have not thoroughly understood themselves;  indeed they have done nothing more than imagined a negative quality,  of which they cannot have any correct idea: matter alone is capable of  acting on our senses; without this action nothing would be capable  of making itself known to us. They have not seen that a being without  extent is neither in a capacity to move itself, nor has the capability  of communicating motion to the body; since such a being, having no  parts, has not the faculty of changing its relation, or its distance,  relatively to other bodies, nor of exciting motion in the human body,  which is itself material. That which is called our soul moves itself  with us; now motion is a property of matter--this soul gives impulse to  the arm; the arm, moved by it, makes an impression, a blow, that follows  the general law of motion: in this case, the force remaining the same,  if the mass was two-fold, the blow should be double. This soul again  evinces its materiality in the invincible obstacles it encounters on  the part of the body. If the arm be moved by its impulse when nothing  opposes it, yet this arm can no longer move, when it is charged with  a weight beyond its strength. Here then is a mass of matter that  annihilates the impulse given by a spiritual cause, which spiritual  cause having no analogy with matter, ought not to find more difficulty  in moving the whole world, than in moving a single atom, nor an atom,  than the universe. From this, it is fair to conclude, such a substance  is a chimera--a being of the imagination. That it required a being  differently endowed, differently constituted, to set matter in  motion--to create all the phenomena we behold: nevertheless, it is a  being the metaphysicians have made the contriver, the Author of Nature.  As man, in all his speculations, takes himself for the model, he no  sooner imagined a spirit within himself, than giving it extent, he  made it universal; then ascribed to it all those causes with which his  ignorance prevents him from becoming acquainted, thus he identified  himself with the Author of Nature--then availed himself of the  supposition to explain the connection of the soul with the body: his  self-complacency prevented his perceiving that he was only enlarging the  circle of his errors, by pretending to understand that which it is  more than possible he will never be permitted to know; his self-love  prevented him from feeling, that whenever he punished another for not  thinking as he did, that he committed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"not rest upon better  foundations than the unanimity of man on this subject, I am fearful  it would not be placed upon so solid a rock as those who make this  asseveration may imagine: the fact is, man is not generally agreed upon  this point; if he was, superstition could have no existence; the idea  of God cannot be _innate_, because, independent of the proofs offered on  every side of the almost impossibility of innate ideas, one simple fact  will set such an opinion for ever at rest, except with those who are  obstinately determined not to be convinced by even their own arguments:  if this idea was innate, it must be every where the same; seeing that  that which is antecedent to man's being, cannot have experienced the  modifications of his existence, which are posterior. Even if it were  waived, that the same idea should be expected from all mankind, but  that only every nation should have their ideas alike on this subject,  experience will not warrant the assertion, since nothing can be better  established than that the idea is not uniform even in the same town;  now this would be an insuperable quality in an innate idea. It not  unfrequently happens, that in the endeavour to prove too much, that  which stood firm before the attempt, is weakened; thus a bad advocate  frequently injures a good cause, although he may not be able to overturn  the rights on which it is rested. It would, therefore, perhaps, come  nearer to the point if it was said, \"that the natural curiosity of  mankind have in all ages, and in all nations, led him to seek after the  primary cause of the phenomena he beholds; that owing to the variations  of his climate, to the difference of his organization, the greater  or less calamity he has experienced, the variety of his intellectual  faculties, and the circumstances under which he has been placed, man  has had the most opposite, contradictory, extravagant notions of the  Divinity, but that he has uniformly been in accord in acknowledging both  the existence, and the wisdom of his work--NATURE.\"    If disengaged from prejudice, we analyze this proof, we shall see that  the universal consent of man, so diffused over the earth, actually  proves little more than that he has been in all countries exposed to  frightful revolutions, experienced disasters, been sensible to sorrows  of which he has mistaken the physical causes; that those events to which  he has been either the victim or the witness, have called forth his  admiration or excited his fear; that for want of being acquainted with  the powers of nature, for want of understanding her laws, for want of  comprehending her infinite resources, for want of knowing the effects  she must necessarily produce under given circumstances, he has believed  these phenomena were due to some secret agent of which he has had vague  ideas--to beings whom he has supposed conducted themselves after his own  manner; who were operated upon by similar motives with himself.    The consent then of man in acknowledging a variety of gods, proves  nothing, except that in the bosom of ignorance he has either admired  the phenomena of nature, or trembled under their influence; that his  imagination was disturbed by what he beheld or suffered; that he has  sought in vain to relieve his perplexity, upon the unknown cause of  the phenomena he witnessed, which frequently obliged him to quake with  terror: the imagination of the human race has laboured variously upon  these causes, which have almost always been incomprehensible to him;  although every thing confessed his ignorance, his inability to define  these causes, yet he maintained that he was assured of their existence;  when pressed, he spoke of a spirit, (a word to which it was impossible  to attach any determinate idea) which taught nothing but the sloth,  which evidenced nothing but the stupidity of those who pronounced it.    It ought, however, not to excite any surprise that man is incapable of  forming any substantive ideas, save of those things which act, or which  have heretofore acted upon his senses; it is very evident that the  only objects competent to move his organs are material,--that none but  physical beings can furnish him with ideas,--a truth which has been  rendered sufficiently clear in the commencement of this work, not to  need any further proof. It will suffice therefore to say that the idea  of God is not an innate, but an acquired notion; that it is the very  nature of this notion to vary from age to age; to differ in one country  from another; to be viewed variously by individuals. What do I say?  It is, in fact, an idea hardly ever constant in the same mortal. This  diversity, this fluctuation, this change, stamps it with the true  character of an acquired opinion. On the other hand, the strongest proof  that can be adduced that these ideas are founded in error, is, that man  by degrees has arrived at perfectioning all the sciences which have any  known objects for their basis, whilst the science of theology has not  advanced; it is almost every where at the same point; men seem equally  undecided on this subject; those who have most occupied themselves with  it, have effected but little; they seem, indeed, rather to have rendered  the primitive ideas man formed to himself on this head more obscure,--to  have involved in greater mystery all his original opinions.    As soon as it is asked of man, what are the gods before whom he  prostrates himself, forthwith his sentiments are divided. In order that  his opinions should be in accord, it would be requisite that uniform  ideas, analogous sensations, unvaried perceptions, should every where  have given birth to his notions upon this subject: but this would  suppose organs perfectly similar, modified by sensations which have  a perfect affinity: this is what could not happen: because man,  essentially different by his temperament, who is found under  circumstances completely dissimilar, must necessarily have a great  diversity of ideas upon objects which each individual contemplates so  variously. Agreed in some general points, each made himself a god after  his own manner; he feared him, he served him, after his own mode. Thus  the god of one man, or of one nation, was hardly ever that of another  man, or of another nation. The god of a savage, unpolished people, is  commonly some material object, upon which the mind has exercised itself  but little; this god appears very ridiculous in the eyes of a more  polished community, whose minds have laboured more intensely upon the  subject. A spiritual god, whose adorers despise the worship paid by the  savage to a coarse, material object, is the subtle production of the  brain of thinkers, who, lolling in the lap of polished society quite at  their leisure, have deeply meditated, have long occupied themselves  with the subject. The theological god, although for the most part  incomprehensible, is the last effort of the human imagination; it is to  the god of the savage, what an inhabitant of the city of Sybaris, where  effiminacy and luxury reigned, where pomp and pageantry had reached  their climax, clothed with a curiously embroidered purple habit of silk,  was to a man either quite naked, or simply covered with the skin of  a beast perhaps newly slain. It is only in civilized societies, that  leisure affords the opportunity of dreaming--that ease procures the  facility of reasoning; in these associations, idle speculators meditate,  dispute, form metaphysics: the faculty of thought is almost void in the  savage, who is occupied either with hunting, with fishing, or with  the means of procuring a very precarious subsistence by dint of almost  incessant labour. The generality of men, however, have not more elevated  notions of the divinity, have not analyzed him more than the savage. A  spiritual, immaterial God, is formed only to occupy the leisure of some  subtle men, who have no occasion to labour for a subsistence. Theology,  although a science so much vaunted, considered so important to the  interests of man, is only useful to those who live at the expense of  others; or of those who arrogate to themselves the privilege of thinking  for all those who labour. This science becomes, in some polished  societies, who are not on that account more enlightened, a branch of  commerce extremely advantageous to its professors; equally unprofitable  to the citizens; above all when these have the folly to take a very  decided interest in their unintelligible system--in their discordant  opinions.    What an infinite distance between an unformed stone, an animal, a star,  a statue, and the abstracted Deity, which theology hath clothed with  attributes under which it loses sight of him itself! The savage without  doubt deceives himself in the object to which he addresses his vows;  like a child he is smitten with the first object that strikes his  sight--that operates upon him in a lively manner; like the infant, his  fears are alarmed by that from which he conceives he has either  received an injury or suffered disgrace; still his ideas are fixed by a  substantive being, by an object which he can examine by his senses. The  Laplander who adores a rock,--the negro who prostrates himself before  a monstrous serpent, at least see the objects they adore. The idolater  falls upon his knees before a statue, in which he believes there resides  some concealed virtue, some powerful quality, which he judges may be  either useful or prejudicial to himself; but that subtle reasoner,  called a metaphysician, who in consequence of his unintelligible  science, believes he has a right to laugh at the savage, to deride the  Laplander, to scoff at the negro, to ridicule the idolater, doth  not perceive that he is himself prostrate before a being of his own  imagination, of which it is impossible he should form to himself any  correct idea, unless, like the savage, he re-enters into visible nature,  to clothe"]]]
