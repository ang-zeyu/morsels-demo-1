The  horrific array of prickles presented as it digs an undignified retreat,  and the tenacity with which it holds the ground, have given rise to the  fiction that no dog is capable of killing an echidna. No ordinary dog is.  He must be cunning, daring, brave, insensible to pain, and resourceful.  Then the feat is quite ordinary. Indeed, once the trick is learned, the  trouble is to keep the dog from attacking its innocent, useful and most  retiring enemy. The echidna has the ill-luck to possess certain subtle  qualities, which excite terrific enthusiasm for its destruction on the  part of the dog. Either there is an hereditary feud between the dog and  the echidna, which the former is bound in honour to push to the last  extremity, or else the dog regards the prickly creature as a perpetual  affront, or specially created to provide opportunities for displaying  fanatic hatred and hostility. No dog of healthy instinct is able to pass  an echidna without some sort of an attempt upon its life. The long  tubular nose of the echidna is the vital spot. This is guarded with such  shrewdness and determination as to be impregnable. But the dog which  pursues the proper tactics, and is wily and patient, sooner or  later-regardless of the alleged poisonous spur--seizes one of the hind  legs, and the conflict quickly comes to an end.    By the blacks the echidna, which is known as \"Coombee-yan,\" is placed on  the very top of the list of those dainties which the crafty old men  reserve for themselves under awe-inspiring penalties.    Next in size to the echidna is the white-tipped rat (UROMYS HIRSUTIS?),  water-loving, nocturnal in its habits, fierce and destructive. A  collateral circumstance revealed absolute proof of its existence, which  had previously depended upon vague statements of the blacks. Cutting  firewood in the forest one morning, I came across a carpet snake, 12 feet  long, laid out and asleep in a series of easy curves, with the sun  revealing unexpected beauty in the tints and in the patterns of the skin.  Midway of its length was a tell-tale bulge, and before the axe shortened  it by a head, I was convinced that here was a serpent that had waylaid  and surprised or beguiled a fowl. Post-mortem examination, however,  proved once more the unreliability of uncorroborated circumstantial  evidence. The snake had done good and friendly service instead of ill,  for it had swallowed a white-tailed rat--the only specimen that I have  seen on the island.    Next comes the little frugivorous rat of russet brown, with a glint of  gold on its fur tips. A delicate, graceful creature, nice in its habits,  with a plaintive call like the cheep of a chicken; preferring ripe  bananas and pine-apple, but consenting to nibble at other fruits, as well  as grain. The mother carries her young crouched on her haunches, clinging  to her fur apparently with teeth as well as claws, and she manages to  scuttle along fairly fast, in spite of her encumbrances. The first that I  saw bearing away her family to a place of refuge was deemed to be  troubled with some hideous deformity aft, but inspection at close  quarters showed how she had converted herself into a novel perambulator.  I am told that no other rodent has been observed to carry its young in  this fashion. Perhaps the habit has been acquired as a result of insular  peculiarities, the animal, unconscious of the way of its kind on the  mainland, having invented a style of its own, \"ages ahead of the  fashion.\"    Mr C. W. de Vis, M.A., of the Queensland Museum, who has considerately  examined specimens of this rat, pronounces it to be extraordinary, in  that it combines types of three genera--the teeth of the mus, the mammae  of the mastacomys and the scales on the tail of the genus UROMYS. In the  bestowal of a name he has favoured the latter genus. The animal has been  introduced to the scientific world under the title UROMYS BANFIELDI, by  Mr de Vis, who, referring to it as \"eccentric,\" says, \"The female first  sent to us as an example of the species had no young with her, nor were  her mammae much in evidence; consequently, the advent of a specimen  caught in the act of carrying young was awaited with interest. Fortune at  length favoured our correspondent with an opportunity of placing the  correctness of his observation beyond question. (A mother with a pair of  infants attached to the teats was chloroformed and sent to Brisbane). On  arrival, the young were found detached. The conical corrugated nipples  are, compared with the size of the animal, very long; one, especially,  20 mm. in length, calls to mind a marsupial teat.\"    By the examination of adult specimens the age at which the young  disassociate themselves from the mother has been ascertained. Long after  the time of life at which other species of rats are nibbling an  independent way through the world, U. BANFIELDI clings resolutely to its  parent, obtaining from her its sole sustenance. Not until the \"infant\" is  nearly half the size of the mother does it begin to earn its living and  trust to its own means of locomotion.    The presence of the echidna in three colours--black, grey, and straw--and  two species of rats emphasises the absence of marsupials, unaccountable  unless on the theory of extermination by the original inhabitants in the  remote past.          CHAPTER III        BIRDS AND THEIR RIGHTS      \"As the sweet voice of a bird,  Heard by the lander in a lonely isle  Moves him to think what kind of bird it is,  That sings so delicately clear, and make  Conjecture of the plumage and the form.\"      Frankly it must be admitted that the idea of retiring to an island was  not spontaneous. It was evolved from a sentimental regard for the welfare  of bird and plant life. Having pondered upon the destructive instinct  which prevails in mankind, having seen that, though the offences which  man commits against the laws of Nature are promptly detected and  assuredly punished, they are yet repeated over and over again, and having  more pity for the victims of man's heartlessness and folly than regard  for the consequences which man suffers in the blows that Nature inflicts  as she recoils, the inevitable conclusion was that moral suasion was of  little purpose--that there must be more of example than precept. In this  particular case how speedy and effective has been the result will be seen  later on. Man destroys birds for sport, or in mere wantonness, and the  increasing myriads of insect hosts lay such toll upon his crops and the  fruit of the earth which by the exercise of high intelligence and noble  perseverance he has improved and made plentiful, that the national loss  is to be counted by hundreds of thousands. In this, as in all other  interferences with natural laws, we blunder unless we reckon      \"With that  Fixed arithmic of the universe,  Which meteth good for good, ill for ill,  Measure for measure.\"      There may be a sort of satisfaction in the reflection, that for, perhaps,  every insectivorous bird wantonly killed, some proportion of its weight  in silver has to be paid indirectly by the country. But the satisfaction  is of no avail to the dead bird nor to the species, unless the taxpayer  feels the smart and becomes indignant. We want to save the lives of the  birds, and the silver, then to moralise; not kill the bird and be  compelled to spend the silver in destroying insects that the bird would  have delighted to consume, and moralise upon the destructiveness of some  hitherto insignificant bug or beetle, which has suddenly developed into a  national calamity.    So it was resolved, as other phases of island life matured, that one of  the first ordinances to be proclaimed would be that forbidding  interference with birds. That ordinance prevails. Our sea-girt hermitage  is a sanctuary for all manner of birds, save those of murderous and  cannibalistic instincts. We give all a hearty welcome and make friends of  them if possible. During the eight years of our occupancy many shy  creatures have become quite bold and familiar; though I am fain to admit,  with disappointment, that but slight increases in the species represented  have been noticed. Four strange species of terns, which are wont to lay  on the bare reef patches of the Barrier, now visit Purtaboi regularly  every season, depositing their eggs among those of two other species,  which in spite of disturbance by the blacks, year after year refused to  abandon the spot. Possibly the fact that a haven of refuge has been  established has not been widely promulgated among our friends. Those who  are with us or visit us have peace and security, and are for the most  part friendly and trustful.    Man--the late-comer, the last work, the perfect form--is not always  kindly disposed towards the lower orders, though the dominion he  exercises over them is absolute. Were not the beasts of the field, the  birds of the air, the very fish of the sea, given over to his arbitrary  authority? Here the interest in birds is mainly protective. The printed  law of the land says in ponderous paragraphs all duly numbered and  subdivided, that it is unlawful to kill many Queensland birds; and the  pains and penalties for disregard thereof, are they not set out in  terrifying array? But who cares? Take, for an example, the lovely  Gouldian finch. The law makes it an offence to kill the birds, or to take  their eggs, or to have them in possession dead or alive. Yet trappers go  out into the habitation of the bird and snare them by the thousand. Fifty  thousand pairs have been sent away in a single season. Not one tenth of  those which twitter so faintly and yet so sweetly to their tiny loves of  their own land and their erstwhile freedom, ever live to be gloated over,  because of their fatal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#19)"],[1,"methods constitute a sort of machinery, by which thought and  study are done to every person's hand without his putting himself to  the slightest inconvenience in the matter. There is another species of  machine for the wholesale manufacture of individual morality. This  excellent result is effected by societies for all manner of virtuous  purposes, with which a man has merely to connect himself, throwing, as  it were, his quota of virtue into the common stock, and the president  and directors will take care that the aggregate amount be well applied.  All these, and other wonderful improvements in ethics, religion, and  literature, being made plain to my comprehension by the ingenious Mr.  Smooth-it-away, inspired me with a vast admiration of Vanity Fair.    It would fill a volume, in an age of pamphlets, were I to record all my  observations in this great capital of human business and pleasure.  There was an unlimited range of society--the powerful, the wise, the  witty, and the famous in every walk of life; princes, presidents,  poets, generals, artists, actors, and philanthropists,--all making  their own market at the fair, and deeming no price too exorbitant for  such commodities as hit their fancy. It was well worth one's while,  even if he had no idea of buying or selling, to loiter through the  bazaars and observe the various sorts of traffic that were going  forward.    Some of the purchasers, I thought, made very foolish bargains. For  instance, a young man having inherited a splendid fortune, laid out a  considerable portion of it in the purchase of diseases, and finally  spent all the rest for a heavy lot of repentance and a suit of rags. A  very pretty girl bartered a heart as clear as crystal, and which seemed  her most valuable possession, for another jewel of the same kind, but  so worn and defaced as to be utterly worthless. In one shop there were  a great many crowns of laurel and myrtle, which soldiers, authors,  statesmen, and various other people pressed eagerly to buy; some  purchased these paltry wreaths with their lives, others by a toilsome  servitude of years, and many sacrificed whatever was most valuable, yet  finally slunk away without the crown. There was a sort of stock or  scrip, called Conscience, which seemed to be in great demand, and would  purchase almost anything. Indeed, few rich commodities were to be  obtained without paying a heavy sum in this particular stock, and a  man's business was seldom very lucrative unless he knew precisely when  and how to throw his hoard of conscience into the market. Yet as this  stock was the only thing of permanent value, whoever parted with it was  sure to find himself a loser in the long run. Several of the  speculations were of a questionable character. Occasionally a member of  Congress recruited his pocket by the sale of his constituents; and I  was assured that public officers have often sold their country at very  moderate prices. Thousands sold their happiness for a whim. Gilded  chains were in great demand, and purchased with almost any sacrifice.  In truth, those who desired, according to the old adage, to sell  anything valuable for a song, might find customers all over the Fair;  and there were innumerable messes of pottage, piping hot, for such as  chose to buy them with their birthrights. A few articles, however,  could not be found genuine at Vanity Fair. If a customer wished to  renew his stock of youth the dealers offered him a set of false teeth  and an auburn wig; if he demanded peace of mind, they recommended opium  or a brandy bottle.    Tracts of land and golden mansions, situate in the Celestial City, were  often exchanged, at very disadvantageous rates, for a few years' lease  of small, dismal, inconvenient tenements in Vanity Fair. Prince  Beelzebub himself took great interest in this sort of traffic, and  sometimes condescended to meddle with smaller matters. I once had the  pleasure to see him bargaining with a miser for his soul, which, after  much ingenious skirmishing on both sides, his highness succeeded in  obtaining at about the value of sixpence. The prince remarked with a  smile, that he was a loser by the transaction.    Day after day, as I walked the streets of Vanity, my manners and  deportment became more and more like those of the inhabitants. The  place began to seem like home; the idea of pursuing my travels to the  Celestial City was almost obliterated from my mind. I was reminded of  it, however, by the sight of the same pair of simple pilgrims at whom  we had laughed so heartily when Apollyon puffed smoke and steam into  their faces at the commencement of our journey. There they stood amidst  the densest bustle of Vanity; the dealers offering them their purple  and fine linen and jewels, the men of wit and humor gibing at them, a  pair of buxom ladies ogling them askance, while the benevolent Mr.  Smooth-it-away whispered some of his wisdom at their elbows, and  pointed to a newly-erected temple; but there were these worthy  simpletons, making the scene look wild and monstrous, merely by their  sturdy repudiation of all part in its business or pleasures.    One of them--his name was Stick-to-the-right--perceived in my face, I  suppose, a species of sympathy and almost admiration, which, to my own  great surprise, I could not help feeling for this pragmatic couple. It  prompted him to address me.    \"Sir,\" inquired he, with a sad, yet mild and kindly voice, \"do you call  yourself a pilgrim?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"my right to that appellation is indubitable. I am  merely a sojourner here in Vanity Fair, being bound to the Celestial  City by the new railroad.\"    \"Alas, friend,\" rejoined Mr. Stick-to-the-truth, \"I do assure you, and  beseech you to receive the truth of my words, that that whole concern  is a bubble. You may travel on it all your lifetime, were you to live  thousands of years, and yet never get beyond the limits of Vanity Fair.  Yea, though you should deem yourself entering the gates of the blessed  city, it will be nothing but a miserable delusion.\"    \"The Lord of the Celestial City,\" began the other pilgrim, whose name  was Mr. Foot-it-to-heaven, \"has refused, and will ever refuse, to grant  an act of incorporation for this railroad; and unless that be obtained,  no passenger can ever hope to enter his dominions. Wherefore every man  who buys a ticket must lay his account with losing the purchase money,  which is the value of his own soul.\"    \"Poh, nonsense!\" said Mr. Smooth-it-away, taking my arm and leading me  off, \"these fellows ought to be indicted for a libel. If the law stood  as it once did in Vanity Fair we should see them grinning through the  iron bars of the prison window.\"    This incident made a considerable impression on my mind, and  contributed with other circumstances to indispose me to a permanent  residence in the city of Vanity; although, of course, I was not simple  enough to give up my original plan of gliding along easily and  commodiously by railroad. Still, I grew anxious to be gone. There was  one strange thing that troubled me. Amid the occupations or amusements  of the Fair, nothing was more common than for a person--whether at  feast, theatre, or church, or trafficking for wealth and honors, or  whatever he might be doing, to vanish like a soap bubble, and be never  more seen of his fellows; and so accustomed were the latter to such  little accidents that they went on with their business as quietly as if  nothing had happened. But it was otherwise with me.    Finally, after a pretty long residence at the Fair, I resumed my  journey towards the Celestial City, still with Mr. Smooth-it-away at my  side. At a short distance beyond the suburbs of Vanity we passed the  ancient silver mine, of which Demas was the first discoverer, and which  is now wrought to great advantage, supplying nearly all the coined  currency of the world. A little further onward was the spot where Lot's  wife had stood forever under the semblance of a pillar of salt. Curious  travellers have long since carried it away piecemeal. Had all regrets  been punished as rigorously as this poor dame's were, my yearning for  the relinquished delights of Vanity Fair might have produced a similar  change in my own corporeal substance, and left me a warning to future  pilgrims.    The next remarkable object was a large edifice, constructed of  moss-grown stone, but in a modern and airy style of architecture. The  engine came to a pause in its vicinity, with the usual tremendous  shriek.    \"This was formerly the castle of the redoubted giant Despair,\" observed  Mr. Smooth-it-away; \"but since his death Mr. Flimsy-faith has repaired  it, and keeps an excellent house of entertainment here. It is one of  our stopping-places.\"    \"It seems but slightly put together,\" remarked I, looking at the frail  yet ponderous walls. \"I do not envy Mr. Flimsy-faith his habitation.  Some day it will thunder down upon the heads of the occupants.\"    \"We shall escape at all events,\" said Mr. Smooth-it-away, \"for Apollyon  is putting on the steam again.\"    The road now plunged into a gorge of the Delectable Mountains, and  traversed the field where in former ages the blind men wandered and  stumbled among the tombs. One of these ancient tombstones had been  thrust across the track by some malicious person, and gave the train of  cars a terrible jolt. Far up the rugged side of a mountain I perceived  a rusty iron door, half overgrown with bushes and creeping plants, but  with smoke issuing from its crevices.    \"Is that,\" inquired I, \"the very door in the hill-side which the  shepherds assured Christian was a by-way to hell?\"    \"That was a joke on the part of the shepherds,\" said Mr. Smooth-itaway,  with a smile. \"It is neither more nor less than the door of a cavern  which they use as a smoke-house for the preparation of mutton hams.\"    My recollections of the journey are now, for a little space,"]]]
