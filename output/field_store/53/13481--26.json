This account does not explain  how it was that the dishonest runaway apprentice it depicts continued to  retain the friendship and esteem of his master and Mrs. Dodds.    APPRENTICED TO THE SEA.    There undoubtedly was a difficulty about a shilling, and Dr. Young's  version, gathered from those who knew Cook personally and lived in  Staithes and Whitby at the time, is more probable. He says that Cook had  noticed a South Sea shilling, and being struck by the unusual design (it  was only coined in 1723), changed it for one of his own. Saunderson had  also noticed it, and when he missed it, enquired for it perhaps in  somewhat unmeasured terms, but, on the matter being explained, was fully  satisfied. Afterwards, seeing that the boy was bent upon a sea life, he  obtained the father's permission, and took young James to Whitby himself,  where he introduced him to Mr. John Walker, a member of a shipping firm  of repute, to whom he was bound apprentice (not to the firm), and with  whom he never lost touch till the end of his life. The period of  apprenticeship was, on the authority of Messrs. John and Henry Walker,  three years, and not either seven or nine as is usually stated, and the  difficulty about being apprenticed to both Saunderson and Walker is, of  course, set at rest by Mrs. Dodd's explanation.    Whitby was at the time a very important centre of the coasting trade, and  possessed several shipbuilding yards of good reputation, and it was in a  Whitby-built ship, the Freelove, that Cook made his first voyage. She was  a vessel of about 450 tons (some 80 tons larger than the celebrated Bark  Endeavour), was employed in the coal trade up and down the east coast,  and no doubt Cook picked up many a wrinkle of seamanship and many a  lesson of the value of promptitude in the time of danger which would  prove of service when he came to the days of independent command: for the  North Sea has, from time immemorial, been reckoned a grand school from  which to obtain true sailormen for the Royal Service.    As usual in those days, Cook stayed in his employer's house in the  intervals between his trips, and his time ashore was longer during the  winter months as the ships were generally laid up. The house in Grape  Street, at present occupied by Mr. Braithwaite, is pointed out as the one  where he lived whilst with Mr. Walker; but this is incorrect, for Mr.  Waddington ascertained from the rate books that Mr. Walker's mother was  living there at that time, and Mr. Walker lived in Haggargate from 1734  to 1751, removing thence to the north side of Bakehouse Yard in that  year, and to Grape Street in 1752, after his mother's death. That is, he  did not reside in Grape Street till three years after Cook's  apprenticeship was ended, when, following the usual custom, he would have  to fend for himself. During these periods of leisure between his voyages,  Cook endeavoured to improve his store of knowledge, and it is believed he  received some instruction in elementary navigation. He made great friends  with Mr. Walker's housekeeper, Mary Prowd, from whom he obtained the  concession of a table and a light in a quiet corner away from the others,  where he might read and write in peace. That he worked hard to improve  himself is evident from the fact that Mr. Walker pushed him on at every  opportunity, and gave him as varied an experience of things nautical as  lay in his power.    After several voyages in the Freelove (which is stated by the Yorkshire  Gazette to have been \"lost, together with one hundred and fifty  passengers and the winter's supply of gingerbread for Whitby, off either  the French or Dutch coast\" one stormy Christmas, the date not given) Cook  was sent to assist in rigging and fitting for sea a vessel, called the  Three Brothers, some 600 tons burden, which was still in existence  towards the close of last century. When she was completed, Cook made two  or three trips in her with coals, and then she was employed for some  months as a transport for troops from Middleburg to Dublin and Liverpool.  She was paid off by the Government at Deptford in the spring of 1749, and  then traded to Norway, during which time Cook completed his  apprenticeship, that is, in July 1749. Cook told the naturalist of the  second South Sea voyage, Mr. Forster, that on one of his trips to Norway  the rigging of the ship was completely covered with birds that had been  driven off the land by a heavy gale, and amongst them were several hawks  who made the best of their opportunities with the small birds.    OFFERED COMMAND.    When his apprenticeship had expired he went before the mast for about  three years. In 1750 he was in the Baltic trade on the Maria, owned by  Mr. John Wilkinson of Whitby, and commanded by Mr. Gaskin, a relative of  the Walkers. The following year he was in a Stockton ship, and in 1752 he  was appointed mate of Messrs. Walker's new vessel, the Friendship, on  board of which he continued for three years, and of which, on the  authority of Mr. Samwell, the surgeon of the Discovery on the third  voyage, who paid a visit to Whitby on his return and received his  information from the Walkers, he would have been given the command had he  remained longer in the mercantile marine. This was rapid promotion for a  youth with nothing to back him up but his own exertions and strict  attention to duty, and tends to prove that he had taken full advantage of  the opportunities that fell in his way, and had even then displayed a  power of acquiring knowledge of his profession beyond the average.    About this time Cook's father seems to have given up his position at Airy  Holme Farm and turned his attention to building. A house in Ayton is  still pointed out as his work, but has apparently been partially rebuilt,  for Dr. Young speaks of it as a stone house, and it is now partly brick,  but the stone doorway still remains, with the initials J.G.C., for James  and Grace Cook, and the date 1755. The old man has been represented as  completely uneducated, but this cannot have been true. Colman in his  Random Recollections, writing of a visit he paid to Redcar about 1773,  relates how a venerable old man was pointed out who:    \"only two or three years previously had learnt to read that he might  gratify a parent's pride and love by perusing his son's first voyage  round the world. He was the father of Captain Cook.\"    If it is true that he was the son of an Elder of the Scottish Church, it  is extremely improbable that he was entirely uneducated, and the position  he held as hind to Mr. Skottowe would necessitate at any rate some  knowledge of keeping farming accounts. More convincing information still  is to be found in the Leeds Mercury of 27th October 1883, where Mr.  George Markham Tweddell, of Stokesley, writes:    \"I may mention that Captain Cook's father was not the illiterate man he  has been represented; and I have, lying on my study table as I write, a  deed bearing his signature, dated 1755; and the father's signature bears  a resemblance to that of his distinguished son.\"    Reading is invariably learnt before writing, and as in 1755 the old man  was sixty-one, it is evident he did not wait till he was eighty to learn  to read.    FATHER'S GRAVE.    He claimed to have carved the inscription on the family tombstone in  Great Ayton churchyard, and after spending the last years of his life  under the roof of his son-in-law, James Fleck of Redcar, he died on 1st  April 1778, aged eighty-four years. He was buried in Marske churchyard,  but there was nothing to mark his grave, and its place has long been  forgotten. His death is registered as that of a \"day labourer.\"      CHAPTER 2. 1755 TO 1757. H.M.S. EAGLE.    Notwithstanding the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748, troubles were  constantly arising between the French and English in which the American  Colonies of both nations took a conspicuous part, and ultimately led to  open war. The first shot was fired on 10th June 1755, although war was  not formally declared till May 1756. In June 1755 the Friendship was in  the Thames, and it is said that to avoid the hot press which had been  ordered Cook first went into hiding for some time and then decided to  volunteer. This is untrue, for, as has been shown, he had already made up  his mind and had refused Messrs. Walker's offer of the command of one of  their ships, the acceptance of which would have saved him from the press  as Masters were exempt. He now saw his opportunity had come. He knew that  experienced men were difficult to obtain, that men of a certain amount of  nautical knowledge and of good character could soon raise themselves  above the rank of ordinary seamen, and had doubtless in his mind many  cases of those who entering as seamen found their way to the quarterdeck,  and knowing he had only to ask the Walkers for letters of recommendation  for them to be at his service, he determined to take the important step  and volunteer into the Royal Navy. It must be remembered that this act of  leaving employment which, to most men of his position, would have seemed  most satisfactory, was not the act of hot-headed youth, no step taken in  mere spirit of adventure, but the calmly reasoned act of a man of  twenty-seven years and some eight or nine years experience of both the  rough and smooth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#2)"],[1," and essential information concerning the individuals is  presented below.        _List of animals in collection_    Skirrl. _Pithecus irus_.

When I arrived in Santa Barbara, Doctor Hamilton was about to remodel,  or rather reconstruct, his animal cages and laboratory. This gave us  opportunity to adapt both to the special needs of my experiments. The  laboratory was finally located and built in a grove of live oaks. From  the front it is well shown by figure 10 of plate III, and from the rear,  by figure 11. Its location was in every way satisfactory for my work,  and in addition, the spot proved a delightful one in which to spend  one's time.      [Illustration: FIGURE 12.--Ground plan of Montecito laboratory and  cages. Scale 1/120    L, laboratory; C, cages; A, experiment room in which multiple-choice  apparatus was installed; B, E, additional rooms for research; D, store  room and shop; Z, large central cage communicating with the eight  smaller cages 1-8.]      Figure 12 is a ground plan, drawn to scale, of the laboratory and the  adjoining cages, showing the relations of the several rooms of the  laboratory among themselves and to the nine cages. Although the  construction was throughout simple, everything was convenient and so  planned as to expedite my experimental work. The large room A, adjoining  the cages, was used exclusively for an experimental study of ideational  behavior by means of my recently devised multiple-choice method.  Additional, and supplementary, experiments were conducted in the large  cage Z. Room D served as a store-room and work-shop.    The laboratory was forty feet long, twenty-two feet wide, and ten feet  to the plate. Each small cage was six, by six, by twelve feet deep,  while the large compartment into which each of the smaller cages opened  was twenty-four feet long, ten feet wide, and twelve feet deep.        II    OBSERVATIONAL PROBLEMS AND METHODS      My chief observational task in Montecito was the study of ideational  behavior, or of such adaptive behavior in monkeys and apes as  corresponds to the ideational behavior of man. It was my plan to  determine, so far as possible in the time at my disposal, the existence  or absence of ideas and the role which they play in the solution of  problems by monkeys and apes. I had in mind the behavioristic form of  the perennial questions: Do these animals think, do they reason, and if  so, what is the nature of these processes as indicated by the  characteristics of their adaptive behavior?    My work, although obviously preliminary and incomplete, differs from  most of the previous studies of the complex behavior of the infrahuman  primates in that I relied chiefly upon a specially devised method and  applied it systematically over a period of several months. The work was  intensive and quantitative instead of more or less incidental, casual,  and qualitative as has usually been the case. Naturally, during the  course of my special study of ideational behavior observations were made  relative to various other aspects of the life of my subjects. Such, for  example, are my notes on the use of the hands, the instincts, the  emotions, and the natural aptitudes of individuals. It is, indeed,  impossible to observe any of the primates without noting most  interesting and illuminating activities. And although the major portion  of my time was spent in hard and monotonous work with my experimental  apparatus, I found time each day to get into intimate touch with the  free activities of my subjects and to observe their social relations and  varied expressions of individuality. As a result of my close  acquaintance with this band of primates, I feel more keenly than ever  before the necessity of taking into account, in connection with all  experimental analyses of behavior, the temperamental characteristics,  experience, and affective peculiarities of individuals.    The light which I have obtained on the general problem of ideation has  come, first, through a method which I have rather inaptly named the  multiple-choice method, and second, and more incidentally, through a  variety of supplementary methods which are described in Section IV of  this report. These supplementary methods are simple tests of ideation  rather than systematic modes of research. They differ from my chief  method, among other respects, in that they have been used by various  investigators during the past ten or fifteen years. It was not my aim to  repeat precisely the observations made by others, but instead to verify  some of them, and more especially, to throw additional light on my main  problem and to further the analysis of complex behavior.    What has been referred to as the multiple-choice method was devised by  me three years ago as a means of obtaining strictly comparable objective  data concerning the problem-solving ability of various types and  conditions of animals. The method was first tried with human subjects in  the Psychopathic Hospital, Boston, with a crude keyboard apparatus  which, however, proved wholly satisfactory as a means of demonstrating  its value. It has since been applied by means of mechanisms especially  adapted to the structure and activities of the organisms, to the study  of the behavior of the crow, pig, rat, and ringdove (Yerkes, 1914;  Coburn and Yerkes, 1915; Yerkes and Coburn, 1915). The method has also  been applied with most gratifying results to the study of the  characteristics of ideational behavior in human defectives,--children,  and adults,--and in subjects afflicted with various forms of mental  disease. It is at present being tried out as a practical test in  connection with vocational guidance and various forms of institutional  examination, such as psychopathic hospital and court examinations.    As no adequate description of the method has yet been published to which  I can here refer, it will be necessary to present its salient  characteristics along with a description of the special form of  apparatus which was found suitable for use with monkeys and apes.    The method is so planned as to enable the observer to present to any  type or condition of organism which he wishes to study any one or all of  a series of problems ranging from the extremely simple to the complex  and difficultly soluble. All of the problems, however, are completely  soluble by an organism of excellent ideational ability. For the human  subject, the solution of the easiest problem of all requires almost no  effort, whereas even moderately difficult problems may require many  repetitions of effort and hours or days of application to the task. In  each case, the solution of the problem depends upon the perception of a  certain constant relation among a series of objects to which the subject  is required to attend and respond. Such relations are, for example,  secondness from one end of the group, middleness, simple alternation of  ends, or progressive movement by constant steps from one end of a group  to the other.    It is possible to present such relational problems by means of  relatively simple reaction-mechanisms. In their essential features, all  of the several types of multiple-choice apparatus designed by the writer  and used either by him or by his students and assistants are the same.  They consist of a series of precisely similar reaction-devices, any one  or all of which may be used in connection with a given observation.  These reaction-mechanisms are so chosen as to be suited to the structure  and action-system of the animal to be studied. For the human being the  mechanism consists of a simple key and the total apparatus is a bank of  keys, with such electrical connections as are necessary to enable the  observer to obtain satisfactory records of the subject's behavior. Let  us suppose the bank of keys, as was actually the case in my first form  of apparatus, to consist of twelve separate reaction-mechanisms; and let  us suppose, further, the constant relation (problem) on the basis of  which the subject is required to react to be that of middleness. It is  evident that in successive trials or experiments the keys must be  presented to the subject in odd groups, the possibilities being groups  of 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11. If for a particular observation the experimenter  wishes to present the first three keys at the left end of the keyboard,  he pushes back the remaining nine keys so that they cannot be operated  and requires the subject to select from the group of three keys the one  which on being pressed causes a signal to appear. It is of course the  clearly understood task of the subject to learn to select the correct  key in the group on first trial. This becomes possible only as the  subject observes the relation of the key which produces the desired  effect to the other keys in the group. On the completion of a subject's  reaction to the group of three keys, a group of seven keys at the  opposite end of the keyboard may, for example, be presented. Similarly,  the subject is required to discover with the minimum number of trials  the correct reaction-mechanism. Thus, time after time, the experimenter  presents a different group of keys so that the subject in no two  successive trials is making use of the same portion of the keyboard. It  is therefore impossible for him to react to spatial relations in the  ordinary sense and manner, and unless he can perceive and appropriately  respond to the particular relation which constitutes the only constant "]]]
