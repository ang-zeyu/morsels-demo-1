Here, kneeling  and making cups of the palms of their hands, they drank their fill,  and then, the spot being cool and shady, they stretched their limbs and  rested them for a space.    In front of them, over beyond the hedge, the dusty road stretched away  across the plain; behind them the meadow lands and bright green fields  of tender young corn lay broadly in the sun, and overhead spread the  shade of the cool, rustling leaves of the beechen tree. Pleasantly to  their nostrils came the tender fragrance of the purple violets and  wild thyme that grew within the dewy moisture of the edge of the little  fountain, and pleasantly came the soft gurgle of the water. All was so  pleasant and so full of the gentle joy of the bright Maytime, that for a  long time no one of the three cared to speak, but each lay on his back,  gazing up through the trembling leaves of the trees to the bright  sky overhead. At last, Robin, whose thoughts were not quite so busy  wool-gathering as those of the others, and who had been gazing around  him now and then, broke the silence.    \"Heyday!\" quoth he, \"yon is a gaily feathered bird, I take my vow.\"    The others looked and saw a young man walking slowly down the highway.  Gay was he, indeed, as Robin had said, and a fine figure he cut, for  his doublet was of scarlet silk and his stockings also; a handsome sword  hung by his side, the embossed leathern scabbard being picked out with  fine threads of gold; his cap was of scarlet velvet, and a broad feather  hung down behind and back of one ear. His hair was long and yellow and  curled upon his shoulders, and in his hand he bore an early rose, which  he smelled at daintily now and then.    \"By my life!\" quoth Robin Hood, laughing, \"saw ye e'er such a pretty,  mincing fellow?\"    \"Truly, his clothes have overmuch prettiness for my taste,\" quoth Arthur  a Bland, \"but, ne'ertheless, his shoulders are broad and his loins are  narrow, and seest thou, good master, how that his arms hang from his  body? They dangle not down like spindles, but hang stiff and bend at  the elbow. I take my vow, there be no bread and milk limbs in those fine  clothes, but stiff joints and tough thews.\"    \"Methinks thou art right, friend Arthur,\" said Little John. \"I do verily  think that yon is no such roseleaf and whipped-cream gallant as he would  have one take him to be.\"    \"Pah!\" quoth Robin Hood, \"the sight of such a fellow doth put a nasty  taste into my mouth! Look how he doth hold that fair flower betwixt his  thumb and finger, as he would say, 'Good rose, I like thee not so ill  but I can bear thy odor for a little while.' I take it ye are both  wrong, and verily believe that were a furious mouse to run across his  path, he would cry, 'La!' or 'Alack-a-day!' and fall straightway into a  swoon. I wonder who he may be.\"    \"Some great baron's son, I doubt not,\" answered Little John, \"with good  and true men's money lining his purse.\"    \"Ay, marry, that is true, I make no doubt,\" quoth Robin. \"What a pity  that such men as he, that have no thought but to go abroad in gay  clothes, should have good fellows, whose shoes they are not fit to tie,  dancing at their bidding. By Saint Dunstan, Saint Alfred, Saint Withold,  and all the good men in the Saxon calendar, it doth make me mad to see  such gay lordlings from over the sea go stepping on the necks of good  Saxons who owned this land before ever their great-grandsires chewed  rind of brawn! By the bright bow of Heaven, I will have their ill-gotten  gains from them, even though I hang for it as high as e'er a forest tree  in Sherwood!\"    \"Why, how now, master,\" quoth Little John, \"what heat is this? Thou  dost set thy pot a-boiling, and mayhap no bacon to cook! Methinks yon  fellow's hair is overlight for Norman locks. He may be a good man and  true for aught thou knowest.\"    \"Nay,\" said Robin, \"my head against a leaden farthing, he is what I say.  So, lie ye both here, I say, till I show you how I drub this fellow.\"  So saying, Robin Hood stepped forth from the shade of the beech tree,  crossed the stile, and stood in the middle of the road, with his hands  on his hips, in the stranger's path.    Meantime the stranger, who had been walking so slowly that all this  talk was held before he came opposite the place where they were, neither  quickened his pace nor seemed to see that such a man as Robin Hood was  in the world. So Robin stood in the middle of the road, waiting while  the other walked slowly forward, smelling his rose, and looking this way  and that, and everywhere except at Robin.    \"Hold!\" cried Robin, when at last the other had come close to him.  \"Hold! Stand where thou art!\"    \"Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?\" said the stranger in soft and  gentle voice. \"And wherefore should I stand where I am? Ne'ertheless, as  thou dost desire that I should stay, I will abide for a short time, that  I may hear what thou mayst have to say to me.\"    \"Then,\" quoth Robin, \"as thou dost so fairly do as I tell thee, and dost  give me such soft speech, I will also treat thee with all due courtesy.  I would have thee know, fair friend, that I am, as it were, a votary at  the shrine of Saint Wilfred who, thou mayst know, took, willy-nilly,  all their gold from the heathen, and melted it up into candlesticks.  Wherefore, upon such as come hereabouts, I levy a certain toll, which  I use for a better purpose, I hope, than to make candlesticks withal.  Therefore, sweet chuck, I would have thee deliver to me thy purse, that  I may look into it, and judge, to the best of my poor powers, whether  thou hast more wealth about thee than our law allows. For, as our good  Gaffer Swanthold sayeth, 'He who is fat from overliving must needs lose  blood.'\"    All this time the youth had been sniffing at the rose that he held  betwixt his thumb and finger. \"Nay,\" said he with a gentle smile, when  Robin Hood had done, \"I do love to hear thee talk, thou pretty fellow,  and if, haply, thou art not yet done, finish, I beseech thee. I have yet  some little time to stay.\"    \"I have said all,\" quoth Robin, \"and now, if thou wilt give me thy  purse, I will let thee go thy way without let or hindrance so soon as I  shall see what it may hold. I will take none from thee if thou hast but  little.\"    \"Alas! It doth grieve me much,\" said the other, \"that I cannot do  as thou dost wish. I have nothing to give thee. Let me go my way, I  prythee. I have done thee no harm.\"    \"Nay, thou goest not,\" quoth Robin, \"till thou hast shown me thy purse.\"    \"Good friend,\" said the other gently, \"I have business elsewhere. I  have given thee much time and have heard thee patiently. Prythee, let me  depart in peace.\"    \"I have spoken to thee, friend,\" said Robin sternly, \"and I now tell  thee again, that thou goest not one step forward till thou hast done as  I bid thee.\" So saying, he raised his quarterstaff above his head in a  threatening way.    \"Alas!\" said the stranger sadly, \"it doth grieve me that this thing must  be. I fear much that I must slay thee, thou poor fellow!\" So saying, he  drew his sword.    \"Put by thy weapon,\" quoth Robin. \"I would take no vantage of thee. Thy  sword cannot stand against an oaken staff such as mine. I could snap  it like a barley straw. Yonder is a good oaken thicket by the roadside;  take thee a cudgel thence and defend thyself fairly, if thou hast a  taste for a sound drubbing.\"    First the stranger measured Robin with his eye, and then he measured the  oaken staff. \"Thou art right, good fellow,\" said he presently, \"truly,  my sword is no match for that cudgel of thine. Bide thee awhile till  I get me a staff.\" So saying, he threw aside the rose that he had been  holding all this time, thrust his sword back into the scabbard, and,  with a more hasty step than he had yet used, stepped to the roadside  where grew the little clump of ground oaks Robin had spoken of. Choosing  among them, he presently found a sapling to his liking. He did not cut  it, but, rolling up his sleeves a little way, he laid hold of it, placed  his heel against the ground, and, with one mighty pull, plucked the  young tree up by the roots from out the very earth. Then he came back,  trimming away the roots and tender stems with his sword as quietly as if  he had done nought to speak of.    Little John and the Tanner had been watching all that passed, but when  they saw the stranger drag the sapling up from the earth, and heard the  rending and snapping of its roots, the Tanner pursed his lips together,  drawing his breath between them in a long inward whistle.    \"By the breath of my body!\" said Little John, as soon as he could gather  his wits from their wonder, \"sawest thou that, Arthur? Marry, I think  our poor master will stand but an ill chance with yon fellow. By Our  Lady, he plucked up yon green tree as it were a barley straw.\"    Whatever Robin Hood thought, he stood his ground, and now he and the  stranger in scarlet stood face to face.    Well did Robin Hood hold his own that day as a mid-country yeoman. This  way and that they fought, and back and forth, Robin's skill against the  stranger's strength. The dust of the highway rose up around them like  a cloud, so that at times Little John and the Tanner could see nothing,  but only hear the rattle of the staves against one another. Thrice Robin  Hood struck the stranger; once upon the arm and twice upon the ribs, and  yet had he warded all the other's blows, only one of which, had it met  its mark, would have laid stout Robin lower in the dust than he had ever  gone before. At last the stranger struck Robin's cudgel so fairly in the  middle that he could hardly hold his staff in his hand; again he struck,  and Robin bent beneath the blow; a third time he struck, and now not  only fairly beat down Robin's guard, but gave him such a rap, also, that  down he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#19)"],[1," in the  postscript.    In this postscript, William of Orange, Stadtholder of Holland, condemned  Cornelius van Baerle to imprisonment for life. He was not sufficiently  guilty to suffer death, but he was too much so to be set at liberty.    Cornelius heard this clause, but, the first feeling of vexation and  disappointment over, he said to himself,--    \"Never mind, all this is not lost yet; there is some good in this  perpetual imprisonment; Rosa will be there, and also my three bulbs of  the black tulip are there.\"    But Cornelius forgot that the Seven Provinces had seven prisons, one for  each, and that the board of the prisoner is anywhere else less expensive  than at the Hague, which is a capital.    His Highness, who, as it seems, did not possess the means to feed Van  Baerle at the Hague, sent him to undergo his perpetual imprisonment at  the fortress of Loewestein, very near Dort, but, alas! also very far  from it; for Loewestein, as the geographers tell us, is situated at the  point of the islet which is formed by the confluence of the Waal and the  Meuse, opposite Gorcum.    Van Baerle was sufficiently versed in the history of his country to know  that the celebrated Grotius was confined in that castle after the  death of Barneveldt; and that the States, in their generosity to the  illustrious publicist, jurist, historian, poet, and divine, had granted  to him for his daily maintenance the sum of twenty-four stivers.    \"I,\" said Van Baerle to himself, \"I am worth much less than Grotius.  They will hardly give me twelve stivers, and I shall live miserably; but  never mind, at all events I shall live.\"    Then suddenly a terrible thought struck him.    \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"how damp and misty that part of the country is,  and the soil so bad for the tulips! And then Rosa will not be at  Loewestein!\"          Chapter 13. What was going on all this Time in the Mind of one of the  Spectators      Whilst Cornelius was engaged with his own thoughts, a coach had driven  up to the scaffold. This vehicle was for the prisoner. He was invited to  enter it, and he obeyed.    His last look was towards the Buytenhof. He hoped to see at the window  the face of Rosa, brightening up again.    But the coach was drawn by good horses, who soon carried Van Baerle  away from among the shouts which the rabble roared in honour of the most  magnanimous Stadtholder, mixing with it a spice of abuse against the  brothers De Witt and the godson of Cornelius, who had just now been  saved from death.    This reprieve suggested to the worthy spectators remarks such as the  following:--    \"It's very fortunate that we used such speed in having justice done to  that great villain John, and to that little rogue Cornelius, otherwise  his Highness might have snatched them from us, just as he has done this  fellow.\"    Among all the spectators whom Van Baerle's execution had attracted to  the Buytenhof, and whom the sudden turn of affairs had disagreeably  surprised, undoubtedly the one most disappointed was a certain  respectably dressed burgher, who from early morning had made such a  good use of his feet and elbows that he at last was separated from the  scaffold only by the file of soldiers which surrounded it.    Many had shown themselves eager to see the perfidious blood of the  guilty Cornelius flow, but not one had shown such a keen anxiety as the  individual just alluded to.    The most furious had come to the Buytenhof at daybreak, to secure a  better place; but he, outdoing even them, had passed the night at the  threshold of the prison, from whence, as we have already said, he had  advanced to the very foremost rank, unguibus et rostro,--that is to say,  coaxing some, and kicking the others.    And when the executioner had conducted the prisoner to the scaffold, the  burgher, who had mounted on the stone of the pump the better to see and  be seen, made to the executioner a sign which meant,--    \"It's a bargain, isn't it?\"    The executioner answered by another sign, which was meant to say,--    \"Be quiet, it's all right.\"    This burgher was no other than Mynheer Isaac Boxtel, who since the  arrest of Cornelius had come to the Hague to try if he could not get  hold of the three bulbs of the black tulip.    Boxtel had at first tried to gain over Gryphus to his interest, but the  jailer had not only the snarling fierceness, but likewise the fidelity,  of a dog. He had therefore bristled up at Boxtel's hatred, whom he had  suspected to be a warm friend of the prisoner, making trifling inquiries  to contrive with the more certainty some means of escape for him.    Thus to the very first proposals which Boxtel made to Gryphus to filch  the bulbs which Cornelius van Baerle must be supposed to conceal, if not  in his breast, at least in some corner of his cell, the surly jailer had  only answered by kicking Mynheer Isaac out, and setting the dog at him.    The piece which the mastiff had torn from his hose did not discourage  Boxtel. He came back to the charge, but this time Gryphus was in bed,  feverish, and with a broken arm. He therefore was not able to admit the  petitioner, who then addressed himself to Rosa, offering to buy her a  head-dress of pure gold if she would get the bulbs for him. On this, the  generous girl, although not yet knowing the value of the object of the  robbery, which was to be so well remunerated, had directed the tempter  to the executioner, as the heir of the prisoner.    In the meanwhile the sentence had been pronounced. Thus Isaac had no  more time to bribe any one. He therefore clung to the idea which Rosa  had suggested: he went to the executioner.    Isaac had not the least doubt that Cornelius would die with the bulbs on  his heart.    But there were two things which Boxtel did not calculate upon:--    Rosa, that is to say, love;    William of Orange, that is to say, clemency.    But for Rosa and William, the calculations of the envious neighbour  would have been correct.    But for William, Cornelius would have died.    But for Rosa, Cornelius would have died with his bulbs on his heart.    Mynheer Boxtel went to the headsman, to whom he gave himself out as  a great friend of the condemned man; and from whom he bought all the  clothes of the dead man that was to be, for one hundred guilders; rather  an exorbitant sum, as he engaged to leave all the trinkets of gold and  silver to the executioner.    But what was the sum of a hundred guilders to a man who was all but sure  to buy with it the prize of the Haarlem Society?    It was money lent at a thousand per cent., which, as nobody will deny,  was a very handsome investment.    The headsman, on the other hand, had scarcely anything to do to earn his  hundred guilders. He needed only, as soon as the execution was over, to  allow Mynheer Boxtel to ascend the scaffold with his servants, to remove  the inanimate remains of his friend.    The thing was, moreover, quite customary among the \"faithful brethren,\"  when one of their masters died a public death in the yard of the  Buytenhof.    A fanatic like Cornelius might very easily have found another fanatic  who would give a hundred guilders for his remains.    The executioner also readily acquiesced in the proposal, making only one  condition,--that of being paid in advance.    Boxtel, like the people who enter a show at a fair, might be  disappointed, and refuse to pay on going out.    Boxtel paid in advance, and waited.    After this, the reader may imagine how excited Boxtel was; with what  anxiety he watched the guards, the Recorder, and the executioner; and  with what intense interest he surveyed the movements of Van Baerle. How  would he place himself on the block? how would he fall? and would he  not, in falling, crush those inestimable bulbs? had not he at least  taken care to enclose them in a golden box,--as gold is the hardest of  all metals?    Every trifling delay irritated him. Why did that stupid executioner thus  lose time in brandishing his sword over the head of Cornelius, instead  of cutting that head off?    But when he saw the Recorder take the hand of the condemned, and raise  him, whilst drawing forth the parchment from his pocket,--when he heard  the pardon of the Stadtholder publicly read out,--then Boxtel was no  more like a human being; the rage and malice of the tiger, of the hyena,  and of the serpent glistened in his eyes, and vented itself in his yell  and his movements. Had he been able to get at Van Baerle, he would have  pounced upon him and strangled him.    And so, then, Cornelius was to live, and was to go with him to  Loewestein, and thither to his prison he would take with him his bulbs;  and perhaps he would even find a garden where the black tulip would  flower for him.    Boxtel, quite overcome by his frenzy, fell from the stone upon some  Orangemen, who, like him, were sorely vexed at the turn which affairs  had taken. They, mistaking the frantic cries of Mynheer Isaac for  demonstrations of joy, began to belabour him with kicks and cuffs, such  as could not have been administered in better style by any prize-fighter  on the other side of the Channel.    Blows were, however, nothing to him. He wanted to run after the coach  which was carrying away Cornelius with his bulbs. But in his hurry  he overlooked a paving-stone in his way, stumbled, lost his centre of  gravity, rolled over to a distance of some yards, and only rose again,  bruised and begrimed, after the whole rabble of the Hague, with their  muddy feet, had passed over him.    One would think that this was enough for one day, but Mynheer Boxtel did  not seem to think so, as, in addition to having his clothes torn, his  back bruised, and his hands scratched, he inflicted upon himself the  further punishment of tearing out his hair by handfuls, as an offering  to that goddess of envy who, as mythology teaches us, wears a head-dress  of serpents.
