All the same I was something  near to tears as I thought of the tragic wreck at Willdon and the  grief-laden hearts that must be mourning. I wondered whether the  Governor was now returning from Willdon after ordering an inquiry.    On his card he had written: \"Please release R. Mifflin at once  and show this lady all courtesies.\" So I didn't anticipate any  particular trouble. This made me all the more anxious to push on,  and after crossing the ferry we halted in Woodbridge only long  enough for supper. I drove past the bank where I had waited in the  anteroom, and would have been glad of a chance to horsewhip that  sneaking little cashier. I wondered how they had transported the  Professor to Port Vigor, and thought ironically that it was only  that Saturday morning when he had suggested taking the hoboes to  the same jail. Still I do not doubt that his philosophic spirit  had made the best of it all.    Woodbridge was as dead as any country town is on Sunday night.  At the little hotel where I had supper there was no topic of  conversation except the wreck. But the proprietor, when I paid  my bill, happened to notice Parnassus in the yard.    \"That's the bus that pedlar sold you, ain't it?\" he asked with  a leer.    \"Yes,\" I said, shortly.    \"Goin' back to prosecute him, I guess?\" he suggested. \"Say, that  feller's a devil, believe _me_. When the sheriff tried to put the  cuffs on him he gave him a black eye and pretty near broke his  jaw. Some scrapper fer a midget!\"    My own brave little fighter, I thought, and flushed with pride.    The road back to Port Vigor seemed endless. I was a little nervous,  remembering the tramps in Pratt's quarry, but with Bock sitting  beside me on the seat I thought it craven to be alarmed. We rumbled  gently through the darkness, between aisles of inky pines where the  strip of starlight ran like a ribbon overhead, then on the rolling  dunes that overlook the water. There was a moon, too, but I was  mortally tired and lonely and longed only to see my little Redbeard.  Peg was weary, too, and plodded slowly. It must have been midnight  before we saw the red and green lights of the railway signals and I  knew that Port Vigor was at hand.    I decided to camp where I was. I guided Peg into a field beside the  road, hitched her to a fence, and took the dog into the van with me.  I was too tired to undress. I fell into the bunk and drew the  blankets over me. As I did so, something dropped down behind the  bunk with a sharp rap. It was a forgotten corncob pipe of the  Professor's, blackened and sooty. I put it under my pillow, and  fell asleep.    Monday, October seventh. If this were a novel about some charming,  slender, pansy-eyed girl, how differently I would have to describe  the feelings with which I woke the next morning. But these being  only a few pages from the life of a fat, New England housewife, I  must be candid. I woke feeling dull and sour. The day was gray and  cool: faint shreds of mist sifting up from the Sound and a desolate  mewing of seagulls in the air. I was unhappy, upset, and--yes--shy.  Passionately I yearned to run to the Professor, to gather him into  my arms, to be alone with him in Parnassus, creaking up some sunny  by-road. But his words came back to me: I was nothing to him. What  if he didn't love me after all?    I walked across two fields, down to the beach where little waves  were slapping against the shingle. I washed my face and hands in  salt water. Then I went back to Parnassus and brewed some coffee  with condensed milk. I gave Peg and Bock their breakfasts. Then I  hitched Peg to the van again, and felt better. As I drove into the  town I had to wait at the grade crossing while a wrecking train  rumbled past, on its way back from Willdon. That meant that the  line was clear again. I watched the grimy men on the cars, and  shuddered to think what they had been doing.    The Vigor county jail lies about a mile out of the town, an ugly,  gray stone barracks with a high, spiked wall about it. I was  thankful that it was still fairly early in the morning, and I drove  through the streets without seeing any one I knew. Finally I reached  the gate in the prison wall. Here some kind of a keeper barred my  way. \"Can't get in, lady,\" he said. \"Yesterday was visitors' day.  No more visitors till next month.\"    \"I _must_ get in,\" I said. \"You've got a man in there on a  false charge.\"    \"So they all say,\" he retorted, calmly, and spat halfway across the  road. \"You wouldn't believe any of our boarders had a right to be  here if you could hear their friends talk.\"    I showed him Governor Stafford's card. He was rather impressed  by this, and retired into a sentry-box in the wall--to telephone,  I suppose.    Presently he came back.    \"The sheriff says he'll see you, ma'am. But you'll have to leave  this here dynamite caboose behind.\" He unlocked a little door in the  immense iron gate, and turned me over to another man inside. \"Take  this here lady to the sheriff,\" he said.    Some of Vigor county's prisoners must have learned to be pretty good  gardeners, for certainly the grounds were in good condition. The  grass was green and trimly mowed; there were conventional beds of  flowers in very ugly shapes; in the distance I saw a gang of men  in striped overalls mending a roadway. The guide led me to an  attractive cottage to one side of the main building. There were two  children playing outside, and I remember thinking that within the  walls of a jail was surely a queer place to bring up youngsters.    But I had other things to think about. I looked up at that grim,  gray building. Behind one of those little barred windows was the  Professor. I should have been angry at Andrew, but somehow it all  seemed a kind of dream. Then I was taken into the hallway of the  sheriff's cottage and in a minute I was talking to a big,  bull-necked man with a political moustache.    \"You have a prisoner here called Roger Mifflin?\" I said.    \"My dear Madam, I don't keep a list of all our inmates in my  head. If you will come to the office we will look up the records.\"    I showed him the Governor's card. He took it and kept looking at it  as though he expected to see the message written there change or  fade away. We walked across a strip of lawn to the prison building.  There, in a big bare office, he ran over a card index.    \"Here we are,\" he said. \"Roger Mifflin; age, 41; face, oval;  complexion, florid; hair, red but not much of it; height, 64  inches; weight, stripped, 120; birthmark....\"    \"Never mind,\" I said. \"That's the man. What's he here for?\"    \"He's held in default of bail, pending trial. The charge is attempt  to defraud one Helen McGill, spinster, age...\"    \"Rubbish!\" I said. \"I'm Helen McGill, and the man made no attempt to  defraud me.\"    \"The charge was entered and warrant applied for by your brother,  Andrew McGill, acting on your behalf.\"    \"I never authorized Andrew to act on my behalf.\"    \"Then do you withdraw the charge?\"    \"By all means,\" I said. \"I've a great mind to enter a counter-charge  against Andrew and have _him_ arrested.\"    \"This is all very irregular,\" said the sheriff, \"but if the prisoner  is known to the Governor, I suppose there is no alternative. I  cannot annul the warrant without some recognizance. According to  the laws of this State the next of kin must stand surety for the  prisoner's good behaviour after release. There is no next of kin....\"    \"Surely there is!\" I said. \"I am the prisoner's next of kin.\"    \"What do you mean?\" he said. \"In what relationship do you  stand to this Roger Mifflin?\"    \"I intend to marry him just as soon as I can get him away from here.\"    He burst into a roar of laughter. \"I guess there's no stopping you,\"  he said. He pinned the Governor's card to a blue paper on the desk,  and began filling in some blanks.    \"Well, Miss McGill,\" he went on, \"don't take away more than one of  my prisoners or I'll lose my job. The turnkey will take you up to  the cell. I'm exceedingly sorry: you can see that the mistake was  none of our fault. Tell the Governor that, will you, when you see  him?\"    I followed the attendant up two flights of bare, stone stairs, and  down a long, whitewashed corridor. It was a gruesome place; rows  and rows of heavy doors with little, barred windows. I noticed  that each door had a combination knob, like a safe. My knees felt  awfully shaky.    But it wasn't really so heart-throbby as I had expected. The jailer  stopped at the end of a long passageway. He spun the clicking dial,  while I waited in a kind of horror. I think I expected to see the  Professor with shaved head (they couldn't shave much off his head,  poor lamb!) and striped canvas suit, and a ball and chain on his  ankle.    The door swung open heavily. There was a narrow, clean little room  with a low camp bed, and under the barred window a table strewn with  sheets of paper. It was the Professor in his own clothes, writing  busily, with his back toward me. Perhaps he thought it was only  an attendant with food, or perhaps he didn't even hear the  interruption. I could hear his pen running busily. I might have  known you never would get any heroics out of that man! Trust him  to make the best of it!    \"Lemon sole and a glass of sherry, please, James,\" said the  Professor over his shoulder, and the warder, who evidently had  joked with him before, broke into a cackle of laughter.    \"A lady to see yer Lordship,\" he said.    The Professor turned round. His face went quite white. For the first  time in my experience of him he seemed to be at a loss for speech.    \"Miss--Miss McGill,\" he stammered. \"You _are_ the good Samaritan.  I'm doing the John Bunyan act, see? Writing in prison. I've really  started my book at last. And I find the fellows here know nothing  whatever about literature. There isn't even a library "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#19)"],[1,"hand.    \"With pleasure, Mrs. Storey, but really you must send for my music, for  Mr. Jones has been making me laugh so, I could not remember a note if I  was to die for it; it is in the cloak room.\"    While Miss Dent was making numerous preparations for the proposed  exhibition, Langley for the first time, left Vernon, and came over to  Kate, who, feeling pleased to speak to her only acquaintance, at least  of any standing, received him with a brilliant smile, making room for  him beside her on the sofa, with her usual unpremeditated grace.    \"I see my friend Galliard has made your acquaintance, Miss Vernon,  without my assistance.\"    \"Ah, out of evil cometh good, thanks to Mademoiselle!\" said the man he  called Galliard, gaily. \"Tore her dress, she pardoned the penitent, and  permitted him to speak, _voilà tout_.\"    A warning hus-sh-sh silenced him, and taking a large pinch of snuff,  he assumed a critical air as Miss Dent struck a powerful blow on an  unfortunate chord, and started off at a brisk gallop up the keys; her  execution was really remarkable, and the music she performed full of  physical difficulties; there were interminable shakes, and thundering  chords; crossing of the hands and rushing from one extreme of the keys  to the other; at last the performance, amid a crash of chords, came to  a sudden end, upon which the talkers, startled at hearing their own  voices, all at once, so loud, stopped too, and clapped their hands.    Miss Dent rose with a triumphant air, gathered together her gloves, fan  and bouquet, and stood at the end of the \"instrument,\" as Mrs. Storey  called it, laughing and talking noisily, with the numerous beaux who  surrounded her.    \"Now, Miss Vernon, may I call upon you?\" said the lady of the house,  approaching.    Kate rose with a smile, and addressing Langley, in a low tone, said--    \"Will you kindly stay with grandpapa, while I play, and do not let him  come near me.\"    She took Mr. Storey's arm, as she spoke, and moved to the piano.  Galliard and two or three more of Langley's friends followed,  with every appearance of interest, very different from the degree  of attention they bestowed on Miss Dent. Kate felt little or no  nervousness; her trial and success, at Herman's, had set her mind at  ease, and she at once began a very lovely Fantasia, composed by Gilpin,  at her request, and meant to convey the feeling of sweet peacefulness  she had described to him, as often stealing over her heart, when, after  the last notes of the evening service had scarce died away, she stood  in the Priory church yard, where it overlooked the river, and saw its  waters silvered by the moonbeams.    The music was of the Mendelssohn school, of which the organist was a  great admirer, and Kate played it well; she knew every note by heart,  from the first solemn sustained chords, to the noble march and tender  aria with which it concludes.    The talkers frequently begun, but were as frequently hushed by the  indignant \"chut, chut\" of the connoisseurs; and when she quietly  rose from the piano, the emphatic \"good, very good!\" \"she can play!\"  \"a remarkable composition!\" testified the satisfaction of Langley's  professional friends; while they left the task of noisy plaudits to  the indiscriminating multitude.    Kate now in her turn, the centre of a little group, had to answer many  questions as to the author of the music she had played, and, with her  usual eagerness to exalt a friend, she pronounced a glowing eulogium on  the organist as a man, and a musician.    \"He has genius, undoubtedly,\" said Galliard, \"but can genius be  satisfied with the obscurity of a little provincial town?\"    \"He is happy there,\" said Kate.    \"Happy!\" Galliard repeated, with a cynical accent.    \"A man must be very happy when he allows it,\" replied Miss Vernon.    \"_E vero_,\" cried Galliard, laughing.    \"Or so very proud that he will not admit the contrary,\" suggested  Langley.    \"If you knew Mr. Gilpin,\" began Kate, when their hostess advancing,  interrupted her, and begged for a song, to which request Kate at once  acceded.    Then the hostess proposed a quadrille, and introduced a young  gentleman, redolent of _eau de mille feurs_, with an elaborately  worked shirt front, lined with pink, and a white pastry face, to Kate,  whispering, in a jocose manner, \"is quite a catch, junior partner  in the great firm of Jones, Brown and Tuckett;\" and, with a knowing  nod, she walked away, leaving Kate half amused at the extraordinary  confidences of her communicative hostess; but feeling through all that,  had she still been heiress of Dungar, and any strange chance had thrown  Mrs. Storey in her way, the acquaintanceship would have been conducted  on very different terms.    She stood up very good-humouredly, however, and replied to all her  partner's vapid remarks, very readily; yet, somehow, Tuckett, junior,  though he was \"the glass of fashion and the mould of form,\" to  Hammond-court, Mincing-lane, did not feel at his ease with her; and  she, in the innocence of her heart, believing that all firms dwelt in  the city, and never dreaming that a man could be so silly as to blush  because he was a worker instead of an idler, put him to torture by her  unconscious questions.    \"I am anxious to explore the city,\" she said, while the side couples  were dancing _La Poule_. \"I suppose you know all its charming nooks by  heart.\"    \"Aw, no, indeed, it's a place I have too great a distaste for, to stay  in, except when obliged.\"    \"For shame,\" said Kate, \"A citizen of 'famous London Town,' ought  to know, and prize the various interesting 'locales' in the mighty  capital.\"    \"Shall I get you an ice?\" said her partner, sullenly.    \"No, no, thank you,\" replied Kate, shaking her head rather mournfully,  as she remembered the last time a similar question had been put to  her; and taking her seat near the Colonel, who was standing with  Langley and Galliard; she dismissed Tuckett, junior, with a gracious  inclination of the head.    Soon after, the Colonel complaining of fatigue, and Kate, glad to  escape her good-humoured host's frequently expressed wish that she  would 'polkar,' took her leave of the _soirée_. Langley and Galliard  attended them to the carriage, which awaited them.    \"Mr. Langley tells me he saw our friend Egerton's name, in some paper,  promoted to a majority,\" said the Colonel.    \"Did he! oh, where?\" cried Kate.    \"It was in the Gazette, I took it up while waiting for Lord H-- --,  whose portrait I am painting.\"    \"What did it say?\" asked Kate, folding her shawl round her.    \"Oh,--'The Honourable Frederic Egerton to be Major in the Lancers,  without purchase, vice,' some one, I forget the name, 'deceased.'\"    \"I dare say it cost him some hard cash, though it is there stated  'without purchase;' I understand all that. Come, Kate. Good night,  Mr. Langley. _Bon soir, monsieur, au plaisir de vous voir_,\" said the  Colonel.    The Frenchman bowed profoundly, and they drove away.    The Colonel was not animated after this piece of gaiety, as he used to  be in former days; it seemed to have depressed him, and he complained  of slight cold. Mrs. O'Toole was woefully disappointed to find that  there was \"ne'er a lord, nor even an honourable, good or bad, at the  party.\"    \"To think iv yer playin' an' singin' for the likes iv thim!\" she  exclaimed, indignantly.    \"What have I said to make you think so contemptuously of the very  respectable people, amongst whom we have spent (I confess) 'a rather  slow evening,' as my eloquent partner would term it?\"    \"Och no matther, sure it's thim that's the only quolity goin' now;  well, niver mind, Miss Kate, we'll lave thim all yet.\"    \"I hope so,\" sighed Kate.          CHAPTER VII.    LETTERS.      The next morning, just as Kate was preparing to write a long letter to  the Winters, one from the kind-hearted little artist was put into her  hand. It was sealed with black wax, and announced the death of poor  Gilpin. He had suffered a good deal; but, towards the last, fell into a  calm, sweet sleep, out of which he suddenly awoke with a look of bright  happiness, such as they had never seen on his face before, as if had  heard a summons inaudible to their ears.    \"I come,\" he said, and, feebly laying his hand on Winter's, passed to  \"where his treasure was,\" without a sigh.    There was little in the letter besides the account of the good man's  death; he had left a memorandum of the persons amongst whom his books  and music were to be distributed. He had desired, kindly messages,  to one or two friends, and the last name he uttered was that of Kate  Vernon.    She read the letter aloud, calmly, but the intonation of her voice  indicated deep emotion; at its conclusion there was a pause, which  neither the Colonel nor his granddaughter were inclined to break; both  were hushed and awed by this description of their friend's passage to  the World of Spirits.    The large, round, pearly tears weighed down Kate's long lashes, and  slowly rolled over her cheeks, without any effort on her part to  restrain them. She was unconscious that she wept.    At last the old man broke the silence, saying,    \"Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like  his!\"    \"Amen,\" replied his granddaughter. \"Oh, dearest grandpapa,\" she  continued at length, \"he has entered into his rest, and though it is  an awful thought to us, that he still exists, but where no mortal eye  can see him; what an exchange from the many woes and struggles of his  warfare here, to the boundless bliss of heaven! He had many sorrows,  and yet surely the coming shadow of a great deliverance rested on  his spirit, long before he was freed! How sensitive he was--about  his appearance I mean--how keenly alive to every glance, and yet how  resolutely he used to brace up his soul to love, and to endure!\"    \"I suppose we shall soon hear from Winter again,\" said the Colonel,  after "]]]
