You surely have nothing to thank him for. But now let  us dine in honor of the occasion.\"    She clapped her hands together and again a table loaded with food  appeared in the cottage. It was a longer table, this time, and places  were set for the three Adepts as well as for Reera and Ervic.    \"Sit down, friends, and eat your fill,\" said the Yookoohoo, but instead  of seating herself at the head of the table she went to the cupboard,  saying to the Adepts: \"Your beauty and grace, my fair friends, quite  outshine my own. So that I may appear properly at the banquet table I  intend, in honor of this occasion, to take upon myself my natural  shape.\"    Scarcely had she finished this speech when Reera transformed herself  into a young woman fully as lovely as the three Adepts. She was not  quite so tall as they, but her form was more rounded and more  handsomely clothed, with a wonderful jeweled girdle and a necklace of  shining pearls. Her hair was a bright auburn red, and her eyes large  and dark.    \"Do you claim this is your natural form?\" asked Ervic of the Yookoohoo.    \"Yes,\" she replied. \"This is the only form I am really entitled to  wear. But I seldom assume it because there is no one here to admire or  appreciate it and I get tired admiring it myself.\"    \"I see now why you are named Reera the Red,\" remarked Ervic.    \"It is on account of my red hair,\" she explained smiling. \"I do not  care for red hair myself, which is one reason I usually wear other  forms.\"    \"It is beautiful,\" asserted the young man; and then remembering the  other women present he added: \"But, of course, all women should not  have red hair, because that would make it too common. Gold and silver  and brown hair are equally handsome.\"    The smiles that he saw interchanged between the four filled the poor  Skeezer with embarrassment, so he fell silent and attended to eating  his supper, leaving the others to do the talking. The three Adepts  frankly told Reera who they were, how they became fishes and how they  had planned secretly to induce the Yookoohoo to transform them. They  admitted that they had feared, had they asked her to help, that she  would have refused them.    \"You were quite right,\" returned the Yookoohoo. \"I make it my rule  never to perform magic to assist others, for if I did there would  always be crowd at my cottage demanding help and I hate crowds and want  to be left alone.\"    \"However, now that you are restored to your proper shapes, I do not  regret my action and I hope you will be of use in saving the Skeezer  people by raising their island to the surface of the lake, where it  really belongs. But you must promise me that after you go away you will  never come here again, nor tell anyone what I have done for you.\"    The three Adepts and Ervic thanked the Yookoohoo warmly. They promised  to remember her wish that they should not come to her cottage again and  so, with a good-bye, took their departure.          Chapter Twenty    A Puzzling Problem      Glinda the Good, having decided to try her sorcery upon the abandoned  submarine, so that it would obey her commands, asked all of her party,  including the Skeezers, to withdraw from the shore of the lake to the  line of palm trees. She kept with her only the little Wizard of Oz, who  was her pupil and knew how to assist her in her magic rites. When they  two were alone beside the stranded boat, Glinda said to the Wizard:    \"I shall first try my magic recipe No. 1163, which is intended to make  inanimate objects move at my command. Have you a skeropythrope with  you?\"    \"Yes, I always carry one in my bag,\" replied the Wizard. He opened his  black bag of magic tools and took out a brightly polished  skeropythrope, which he handed to the Sorceress. Glinda had also  brought a small wicker bag, containing various requirements of sorcery,  and from this she took a parcel of powder and a vial of liquid. She  poured the liquid into the skeropythrope and added the powder. At once  the skeropythrope began to sputter and emit sparks of a violet color,  which spread in all directions. The Sorceress instantly stepped into  the middle of the boat and held the instrument so that the sparks fell  all around her and covered every bit of the blackened steel boat. At  the same time Glinda crooned a weird incantation in the language of  sorcery, her voice sounding low and musical.    After a little the violet sparks ceased, and those that had fallen upon  the boat had disappeared and left no mark upon its surface. The  ceremony was ended and Glinda returned the skeropythrope to the Wizard,  who put it away in his black bag.    \"That ought to do the business all right,\" he said confidently.    \"Let us make a trial and see,\" she replied.    So they both entered the boat and seated themselves.    Speaking in a tone of command the Sorceress said to the boat: \"Carry us  across the lake, to the farther shore.\"    At once the boat backed off the sandy beach, turned its prow and moved  swiftly over the water.    \"Very good--very good indeed!\" cried the Wizard, when the boat slowed  up at the shore opposite from that whence they had departed. \"Even  Coo-ee-oh, with all her witchcraft, could do no better.\"    The Sorceress now said to the boat:    \"Close up, submerge and carry us to the basement door of the sunken  island--the door from which you emerged at the command of Queen  Coo-ee-oh.\"    The boat obeyed. As it sank into the water the top sections rose from  the sides and joined together over the heads of Glinda and the Wizard,  who were thus enclosed in a water-proof chamber. There were four glass  windows in this covering, one on each side and one on either end, so  that the passengers could see exactly where they were going. Moving  under water more slowly than on the surface, the submarine gradually  approached the island and halted with its bow pressed against the huge  marble door in the basement under the Dome. This door was tightly  closed and it was evident to both Glinda and the Wizard that it would  not open to admit the underwater boat unless a magic word was spoken by  them or someone from within the basement of the island. But what was  this magic word?  Neither of them knew.    \"I'm afraid,\" said the Wizard regretfully, \"that we can't get in, after  all. Unless your sorcery can discover the word to open the marble door.\"    \"That is probably some word only known to Coo-ce-oh,\" replied the  Sorceress. \"I may be able to discover what it is, but that will require  time. Let us go back again to our companions.\"    \"It seems a shame, after we have made the boat obey us, to be balked by  just a marble door,\" grumbled the Wizard.    At Glinda's command the boat rose until it was on a level with the  glass dome that covered the Skeezer village, when the Sorceress made it  slowly circle all around the Great Dome.    Many faces were pressed against the glass from the inside, eagerly  watching the submarine, and in one place were Dorothy and Ozma, who  quickly recognized Glinda and the Wizard through the glass windows of  the boat. Glinda saw them, too, and held the boat close to the Dome  while the friends exchanged greetings in pantomime. Their voices,  unfortunately, could not be heard through the Dome and the water and  the side of the boat. The Wizard tried to make the girls understand,  through signs, that he and Glinda had come to their rescue, and Ozma  and Dorothy understood this from the very fact that the Sorceress and  the Wizard had appeared. The two girl prisoners were smiling and in  safety, and knowing this Glinda felt she could take all the time  necessary in order to effect their final rescue.    As nothing more could be done just then, Glinda ordered the boat to  return to shore and it obeyed readily. First it ascended to the surface  of the water, then the roof parted and fell into the slots at the side  of the boat, and then the magic craft quickly made the shore and  beached itself on the sands at the very spot from which it had departed  at Glinda's command. All the Oz people and the Skeezers at once ran to  the boat to ask if they had reached the island, and whether they had  seen Ozma and Dorothy. The Wizard told them of the obstacle they had  met in the way of a marble door, and how Glinda would now undertake to  find a magic way to conquer the door.    Realizing that it would require several days to succeed in reaching the  island raising it and liberating their friends and the Skeezer people,  Glinda now prepared a camp half way between the lake shore and the palm  trees.    The Wizard's wizardry made a number of tents appear and the sorcery of  the Sorceress furnished these tents all complete, with beds, chairs,  tables, flags, lamps and even books with which to pass idle hours. All  the tents had the Royal Banner of Oz flying from the centerpoles and  one big tent, not now occupied, had Ozma's own banner moving in the  breeze.    Betsy and Trot had a tent to themselves, and Button Bright and Ojo had  another. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman paired together in one tent  and so did Jack Pumpkinhead and the Shaggy Man, Cap'n Bill and Uncle  Henry, Tik-Tok and Professor Wogglebug. Glinda had the most splendid  tent of all, except that reserved for Ozma, while the Wizard had a  little one of his own. Whenever it was meal time, tables loaded with  food magically appeared in the tents of those who were in the habit of  eating, and these complete arrangements made the rescue party just  comfortable as they would have been in their own homes.    Far into the night Glinda sat in her tent studying a roll of mystic  scrolls in search of a word that would open the basement door of the  island and admit her to the Great Dome. She also made many magical  experiments, hoping to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#19)"],[1," Locks, bolts, and chains his potent touch obey,       And pleased he leads the dazzled Sage to day.    565    XI. \"YOU! whose fine fingers fill the organic cells,       With virgin earth, of woods and bones and shells;       Mould with retractile glue their spongy beds,       And stretch and strengthen all their fibre-threads.--       Late when the mass obeys its changeful doom,  570  And sinks to earth, its cradle and its tomb,       GNOMES! with nice eye the slow solution watch,       With fostering hand the parting atoms catch,       Join in new forms, combine with life and sense,       And guide and guard the transmigrating Ens.

The earth then effervesces with acids,  and can only be converted into glass by the greatest force of fire. The  gluten has continued united with the earth of the bones above 2000 years  in Egyptian mummies; but by long exposure to air or moisture it  diffolves and leaves only the earth. Hence bones long buried, when  exposed to the air, absorb moisture and crumble into powder. Phil.  Trans. No. 475. The retractibility or elasticity of the animal fibre  depends on the gluten; and of these fibres are composed the membranes  muscles and bones. Haller. Physiol. Tom. I, p. 2.    For the chemical decomposition of animal and vegetable bodies see the  ingenious work of Lavoisier, Traite de Chimie, Tom. I. p. 132. who  resolves all their component parts into oxygene, hydrogene, carbone, and  azote, the three former of which belong principally to vegetable and the  last to animal matter.]    [_The transmigrating Ens_. l. 574, The perpetual circulation of matter  in the growth and dissolution of vegetable and animal bodies seems to  have given Pythagoras his idea of the metempsycosis or transmigration of  spirit; which was afterwards dressed out or ridiculed in variety of  amusing fables. Other philosophers have supposed, that there are two  different materials or essences, which fill the universe. One of these,  which has the power of commencing or producing motion, is called spirit;  the other, which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion,  but not of beginning it, is called matter. The former of these is  supposed to be diffused through all space, filling up the interstices of  the suns and planets, and constituting the gravitations of the sidereal  bodies, the attractions of chemistry, with the spirit of vegetation, and  of animation. The latter occupies comparatively but small space,  constituting the solid parts of the suns and planets, and their  atmospheres. Hence these philosophers have supposed, that both matter  and spirit are equally immortal and unperishable; and that on the  dissolution of vegetable or animal organization, the matter returns to  the general mass of matter; and the spirit to the general mass of  spirit, to enter again into new combinations, according to the original  idea of Pythagoras.    The small apparent quantity of matter that exists in the universe  compared to that of spirit, and the short time in which the recrements  of animal or vegetable bodies become again vivified in the forms of  vegetable mucor or microscopic insects, seems to have given rise to  another curious fable of antiquity. That Jupiter threw down a large  handful of souls upon the earth, and left them to scramble for the few  bodies which were to be had.]      575    \"So when on Lebanon's sequester'd hight       The fair ADONIS left the realms of light,       Bow'd his bright locks, and, fated from his birth       To change eternal, mingled with the earth;--       With darker horror shook the conscious wood,  580  Groan'd the sad gales, and rivers blush'd with blood;       On cypress-boughs the Loves their quivers hung,       Their arrows scatter'd, and their bows unstrung;       And BEAUTY'S GODDESS, bending o'er his bier,       Breathed the soft sigh, and pour'd the tender tear.--  585  Admiring PROSERPINE through dusky glades       Led the fair phantom to Elysian shades,       Clad with new form, with finer sense combined,       And lit with purer flame the ethereal mind.       --Erewhile, emerging from infernal night,  590  The bright Assurgent rises into light,       Leaves the drear chambers of the insatiate tomb,       And shines and charms with renovated bloom.--       While wondering Loves the bursting grave surround,       And edge with meeting wings the yawning ground,  595  Stretch their fair necks, and leaning o'er the brink       View the pale regions of the dead, and shrink;       Long with broad eyes ecstatic BEAUTY stands,       Heaves her white bosom, spreads her waxen hands;       Then with loud shriek the panting Youth alarms,  600  \"My Life! my Love!\" and springs into his arms.\"      [_Adonis_. l. 576. The very antient story of the beautiful Adonis  passing one half of the year with Venus, and the other with Proserpine  alternately, has had variety of interpretations. Some have supposed that  it allegorized the summer and winter solstice; but this seems too  obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem. Others have  believed it to represent the corn, which was supposed to sleep in the  earth during the winter months, and to rise out of it in summer. This  does not accord with the climate of Egypt, where the harvest soon  follows the seed-time.    It seems more probably to have been a story explaining some hieroglyphic  figures representing the decomposition and resuscitation of animal  matter; a sublime and interesting subject, and which seems to have given  origin to the doctrine of the transmigration, which had probably its  birth also from the hieroglyphic treasures of Egypt. It is remarkable  that the cypress groves in the ancient greek writers, as in Theocritus,  were dedicated to Venus; and afterwards became funereal emblems. Which  was probably occasioned by the Cypress being an accompaniment of Venus  in the annual processions, in which she was supposed to lament over the  funeral of Adonis; a ceremony which obtained over all the eastern world  from great antiquity, and is supposed to be referred to by Ezekiel, who  accuses the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammus.]             The GODDESS ceased,--the delegated throng       O'er the wide plains delighted rush along;       In dusky squadrons, and in shining groups,       Hosts follow hosts, and troops succeed to troops;  605  Scarce bears the bending grass the moving freight,       And nodding florets bow beneath their weight.       So when light clouds on airy pinions sail,       Flit the soft shadows o'er the waving vale;       Shade follows shade, as laughing Zephyrs drive,  610  And all the chequer'd landscape seems alive.      [_Zephyrs drive_. l. 609. These lines were originally written thus,        Shade follows shade by laughing Zephyrs drove,      And all the chequer'd landscape seems to move.    but were altered on account of the supposed false grammar in using the  word drove for driven, according to the opinion of Dr. Lowth: at the  same time it may be observed, 1. that this is in many cases only an  ellipsis of the letter _n_ at the end of the word; as froze, for frozen;  wove, for woven; spoke, for spoken; and that then the participle  accidentally becomes similar to the past tense: 2. that the language  seems gradually tending to omit the letter _n_ in other kind of words  for the sake of euphony; as housen is become houses; eyne, eyes; thine,  thy, &c. and in common conversation, the words forgot, spoke, froze,  rode, are frequently used for forgotten, spoken, frozen, ridden. 3. It  does not appear that any confusion would follow the indiscriminate use  of the same word for the past tense and the participle passive, since  the auxiliary verb _have_, or the preceding noun or pronoun always  clearly distinguishes them: and lastly, rhime-poetry must lose the use  of many elegant words without this license.]                               _Argument of the Third Canto._      Address to the Nymphs.
