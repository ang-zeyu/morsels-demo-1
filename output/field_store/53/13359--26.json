How is he going to do it?  Has Congress any  power over the subject of Slavery in Kentucky or Virginia or any other  State of this Union?  How, then, is Mr. Lincoln going to carry out that  principle which he says is essential to the existence of this Union, to  wit: That Slavery must be abolished in all the States of the Union or  must be established in them all?  You convince the South that they must  either establish Slavery in Illinois and in every other Free State, or  submit to its abolition in every Southern State and you invite them to  make a warfare upon the Northern States in order to establish Slavery  for the sake of perpetuating it at home.  Thus, Mr. Lincoln invites, by  his proposition, a War of Sections, a War between Illinois and Kentucky,  a War between the Free States and the Slave States, a War between the  North and South, for the purpose of either exterminating Slavery in  every Southern State or planting it in every Northern State.  He tells  you that the safety of the Republic, that the existence of this Union,  depends upon that warfare being carried on until one Section or the  other shall be entirely subdued.  The States must all be Free or Slave,  for a house divided against itself cannot stand.  That is Mr. Lincoln's  argument upon that question.  My friends, is it possible to preserve  Peace between the North and the South if such a doctrine shall prevail  in either Section of the Union?    \"Will you ever submit to a warfare waged by the Southern States to  establish Slavery in Illinois?  What man in Illinois would not lose the  last drop of his heart's blood before lie would submit to the  institution of Slavery being forced upon us by the other States against  our will?  And if that be true of us, what Southern man would not shed  the last drop of his heart's blood to prevent Illinois, or any other  Northern State, from interfering to abolish Slavery in his State?  Each  of these States is sovereign under the Constitution; and if we wish to  preserve our liberties, the reserved rights and sovereignty of each and  every State must be maintained.  * * *  The difference between Mr.  Lincoln and myself upon this point is, that he goes for a combination of  the Northern States, or the organization of a sectional political party  in the Free States, to make War on the domestic institutions of the  Southern States, and to prosecute that War until they all shall be  subdued, and made to conform to such rules as the North shall dictate to  them.    \"I am aware that Mr. Lincoln, on Saturday night last, made a speech at  Chicago for the purpose, as he said, of explaining his position on this  question.  * * *  His answer to this point which I have been arguing,  is, that he never did mean, and that I ought to know that he never  intended to convey the idea, that he wished the people of  the Free States to enter into the Southern States and interfere with  Slavery.  Well, I never did suppose that he ever dreamed of entering  into Kentucky, to make War upon her institutions, nor will any  Abolitionist ever enter into Kentucky to wage such War.  Their mode of  making War is not to enter into those States where Slavery exists, and  there interfere, and render themselves responsible for the consequences.  Oh, no!  They stand on this side of the Ohio River and shoot across.  They stand in Bloomington and shake their fists at the people of  Lexington; they threaten South Carolina from Chicago.  And they call  that bravery!  But they are very particular, as Mr. Lincoln says, not to  enter into those States for the purpose of interfering with the  institution of Slavery there.  I am not only opposed to entering into  the Slave States, for the purpose of interfering with their  institutions, but I am opposed to a sectional agitation to control the  institutions of other States.  I am opposed to organizing a sectional  party, which appeals to Northern pride, and Northern passion and  prejudice, against Southern institutions, thus stirring up ill feeling  and hot blood between brethren of the same Republic.  I am opposed to  that whole system of sectional agitation, which can produce nothing but  strife, but discord, but hostility, and finally disunion.  * * *    \"I ask Mr. Lincoln how it is that he purposes ultimately to bring about  this uniformity in each and all the States of the Union?  There is but  one possible mode which I can see, and perhaps Mr. Lincoln intends to  pursue it; that is, to introduce a proposition into the Senate to change  the Constitution of the United States in order that all the State  Legislatures may be abolished, State Sovereignty blotted out, and the  power conferred upon Congress to make local laws and establish the  domestic institutions and police regulations uniformly throughout the  United States.    \"Are you prepared for such a change in the institutions of your country?  Whenever you shall have blotted out the State Sovereignties, abolished  the State Legislatures, and consolidated all the power in the Federal  Government, you will have established a Consolidated Empire as  destructive to the Liberties of the People and the Rights of the Citizen  as that of Austria, or Russia, or any other despotism that rests upon  the neck of the People.  * * *  There is but one possible way in which  Slavery can be abolished, and that is by leaving a State, according to  the principle of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, perfectly free to form and  regulate its institutions in its own way.  That was the principle upon  which this Republic was founded, and it is under the operation of that  principle that we have been able to preserve the Union thus far under  its operation.  Slavery disappeared from New Hampshire, from Rhode  Island, from Connecticut, from New York, from New Jersey, from  Pennsylvania, from six of the twelve original Slave-holding States; and  this gradual system of emancipation went on quietly, peacefully, and  steadily, so long as we in the Free States minded our own business, and  left our neighbors alone.    \"But the moment the Abolition Societies were organized throughout the  North, preaching a violent crusade against Slavery in the Southern  States, this combination necessarily caused a counter-combination in the  South, and a sectional line was drawn which was a barrier to any further  emancipation.  Bear in mind that emancipation has not taken place in any  one State since the Free Soil Party was organized as a political party  in this country.  Emancipation went on gradually, in State after State,  so long as the Free States were content with managing their own affairs  and leaving the South perfectly free to do as they pleased; but the  moment the North said we are powerful enough to control you of the  South, the moment the North proclaimed itself the determined master of  the South, that moment the South combined to resist the attack, and thus  sectional parties were formed and gradual emancipation ceased in all the  Slave-holding States.    \"And yet Mr. Lincoln, in view of these historical facts, proposes to  keep up this sectional agitation, band all the Northern States together  in one political Party, elect a President by Northern votes alone, and  then, of course, make a Cabinet composed of Northern men, and administer  the Government by Northern men only, denying all the Southern States of  this Union any participation in the administration of affairs  whatsoever.  I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, whether such a line of  policy is consistent with the peace and harmony of the Country?  Can the  Union endure under such a system of policy?  He has taken his position  in favor of sectional agitation and sectional warfare.  I have taken  mine in favor of securing peace, harmony, and good-will among all the  States, by permitting each to mind its own business, and  discountenancing any attempt at interference on the part of one State  with the domestic concerns of the others.  * * *    \"Mr. Lincoln tells you that he is opposed to the decision of the Supreme  Court in the Dred Scott case.  Well, suppose he is; what is he going to  do about it?  * * * Why, he says he is going to appeal to Congress.  Let  us see how he will appeal to Congress.  He tells us that on the 8th of  March, 1820, Congress passed a law called the Missouri Compromise,  prohibiting Slavery forever in all the territory west of the Mississippi  and north of the Missouri line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes;  that Dred Scott, a slave in Missouri, was taken by his master to Fort  Snelling, in the present State of Minnesota, situated on the west branch  of the Mississippi River, and consequently in the Territory where  Slavery was prohibited by the Act of 1820; and that when Dred Scott  appealed for his Freedom in consequence of having been taken into that  Territory, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Dred  Scott did not become Free by being taken into that Territory, but that  having been carried back to Missouri, was yet a Slave.    \"Mr. Lincoln is going to appeal from that decision and reverse it.  He  does not intend to reverse it as to Dred Scott.  Oh, no!  But he will  reverse it so that it shall not stand as a rule in the future.  How will  he do it?  He says that if he is elected to the Senate he will introduce  and pass a law just like the Missouri Compromise, prohibiting Slavery  again in all the Territories.  Suppose he does re-enact the same law  which the Court has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#19)"],[1,"  happened to be coming in when my mate Tom was sneaking out of the back  door. He saw Tom, and Tom saw him, and smoked through a hole in the  palings into the scrub. The boss looked up at the window, and dropped to  it. I went down, funky enough, I can tell you, and faced him. He said:    \"'Look here, mate, why didn't you come straight to me, and tell me how  you was fixed, instead of sneaking round the trouble in that fashion?  There's no occasion for it.'    \"I felt mean at once, but I said: 'Well, you see, we didn't know you,  boss.'    \"'So it seems. Well, I didn't think of that. Anyway, call up your mate  and come and have a drink; we'll talk over it afterwards.' So I called  Tom. 'Come on,' I shouted. 'It's all right.'    \"And the boss kept us a couple of days, and then gave us as much tucker  as we could carry, and a drop of stuff and a few bob to go on the track  again with.\"    \"Well, he was white, any road.\"    \"Yes. I knew him well after that, and only heard one man say a word  against him.\"    \"And did you stoush him?\"    \"No; I was going to, but Tom wouldn't let me. He said he was frightened  I might make a mess of it, and he did it himself.\"    \"Did what? Make a mess of it?\"    \"He made a mess of the other man that slandered that publican. I'd be  funny if I was you. Where's the matches?\"    \"And could Tom fight?\"    \"Yes. Tom could fight.\"    \"Did you travel long with him after that?\"    \"Ten years.\"    \"And where is he now?\"    \"Dead--Give us the matches.\"          HIS FATHER'S MATE        It was Golden Gully still, but golden in name only, unless indeed the  yellow mullock heaps or the bloom of the wattle-trees on the hillside  gave it a claim to the title. But the gold was gone from the gully, and  the diggers were gone, too, after the manner of Timon's friends when his  wealth deserted him. Golden Gully was a dreary place, dreary even for an  abandoned goldfield. The poor, tortured earth, with its wounds all bare,  seemed to make a mute appeal to the surrounding bush to come up and  hide it, and, as if in answer to its appeal, the shrub and saplings were  beginning to close in from the foot of the range. The wilderness was  reclaiming its own again.    The two dark, sullen hills that stood on each side were clothed from tip  to hollow with dark scrub and scraggy box-trees; but above the highest  row of shafts on one side ran a line of wattle-trees in full bloom.    The top of the western hill was shaped somewhat like a saddle, and  standing high above the eucalypti on the point corresponding with the  pommel were three tall pines. These lonely trees, seen for many miles  around, had caught the yellow rays of many a setting sun long before the  white man wandered over the ranges.    The predominant note of the scene was a painful sense of listening, that  never seemed to lose its tension--a listening as though for the  sounds of digger life, sounds that had gone and left a void that was  accentuated by the signs of a former presence. The main army of diggers  had long ago vanished to new rushes, leaving only its stragglers and  deserters behind. These were men who were too poor to drag families  about, men who were old and feeble, and men who had lost their faith in  fortune. They had dropped unnoticed out of the ranks; and remained to  scratch out a living among the abandoned claims.    Golden Gully had its little community of fossickers who lived in a  clearing called Spencer's Flat on one side and Pounding Flat on the  other, but they lent no life to the scene; they only haunted it. A  stranger might have thought the field entirely deserted until he came on  a coat and a billy at the foot of saplings amongst the holes, and heard,  in the shallow ground underneath, the thud of a pick, which told of some  fossicker below rooting out what little wash remained.    One afternoon towards Christmas, a windlass was erected over an old  shaft of considerable depth at the foot of the gully. A greenhide bucket  attached to a rope on the windlass was lying next morning near the mouth  of the shaft, and beside it, on a clear-swept patch, was a little mound  of cool wet wash-dirt.    A clump of saplings near at hand threw a shade over part of the mullock  heap, and in this shade, seated on an old coat, was a small boy of  eleven or twelve years, writing on a slate.    He had fair hair, blue eyes, and a thin old-fashioned face--a face that  would scarcely alter as he grew to manhood. His costume consisted of a  pair of moleskin trousers, a cotton shirt, and one suspender. He held  the slate rigidly with a corner of its frame pressed close against his  ribs, whilst his head hung to one side, so close to the slate that his  straggling hair almost touched it. He was regarding his work fixedly  out of the corners of his eyes, whilst he painfully copied down the head  line, spelling it in a different way each time. In this laborious task  he appeared to be greatly assisted by a tongue that lolled out of the  corner of his mouth and made an occasional revolution round it, leaving  a circle of temporarily clean face. His small clay-covered toes also  entered into the spirit of the thing, and helped him not a little by  their energetic wriggling. He paused occasionally to draw the back of  his small brown arm across his mouth.    Little Isley Mason, or, as he was called, \"His Father's Mate,\" had  always been a favourite with the diggers and fossickers from the days  when he used to slip out first thing in the morning and take a run  across the frosty flat in his shirt. Long Bob Sawkins would often tell  how Isley came home one morning from his run in the long, wet grass as  naked as he was born, with the information that he had lost his shirt.    Later on, when most of the diggers had gone, and Isley's mother was  dead, he was to be seen about the place with bare, sunbrowned arms and  legs, a pick and shovel, and a gold dish about two-thirds of his height  in diameter, with which he used to go \"a-speckin'\" and \"fossickin'\"  amongst the old mullock heaps. Long Bob was Isley's special crony, and  he would often go out of his way to lay the boy outer bits o' wash  and likely spots, lamely excusing his long yarns with the child by the  explanation that it was \"amusin' to draw Isley out.\"    Isley had been sitting writing for some time when a deep voice called  out from below:    \"Isley!\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Send down the bucket.\"    \"Right.\"    Isley put down his slate, and going to the shaft dropped the bucket down  as far as the slack rope reached; then, placing one hand on the bole of  the windlass and holding the other against it underneath, he let it  slip round between his palms until the bucket reached bottom. A sound of  shovelling was heard for a few moments, and presently the voice cried,  \"Wind away, sonny.\"    \"Thet ain't half enough,\" said the boy, peering down. \"Don't be  frightened to pile it in, father. I kin wind up a lot more'n thet.\"    A little more scraping, and the boy braced his feet well upon the little  mound of clay which he had raised under the handle of the windlass to  make up for his deficiency in stature.    \"Now then, Isley!\"    Isley wound slowly but sturdily, and soon the bucket of \"wash\" appeared  above the surface; then he took it in short lifts and deposited it with  the rest of the wash-dirt.    \"Isley!\" called his father again.    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Have you done that writing lesson yet?\"    \"Very near.\"    \"Then send down the slate next time for some sums.\"    \"All right.\"    The boy resumed his seat, fixed the corner of the slate well into his  ribs, humped his back, and commenced another wavering line.    Tom Mason was known on the place as a silent, hard worker. He was a man  of about sixty, tall, and dark bearded. There was nothing uncommon about  his face, except, perhaps, that it hardened, as the face of a man might  harden who had suffered a long succession of griefs and disappointments.  He lived in little hut under a peppermint tree at the far edge of  Pounding Flat. His wife had died there about six years before, and new  rushes broke out and he was well able to go, he never left Golden Gully.    Mason was kneeling in front of the \"face\" digging away by the light of  a tallow candle stuck in the side. The floor of the drive was very wet,  and his trousers were heavy and cold with clay and water; but the old  digger was used to this sort of thing. His pick was not bringing out  much to-day, however, for he seemed abstracted and would occasionally  pause in his work, while his thoughts wandered far away from the narrow  streak of wash-dirt in the \"face.\"    He was digging out pictures from a past life. They were not pleasant  ones, for his face was stony and white in the dim glow of the candle.    Thud, thud, thud--the blows became slower and more irregular as the  fossicker's mind wandered off into the past. The sides of the drive  seemed to vanish slowly away, and the \"face\" retreated far out beyond a  horizon that was hazy in the glow of the southern ocean. He was standing  on the deck of a ship and by his side stood a brother. They were sailing  southward to the Land of Promise that was shining there in all its  golden glory! The sails pressed forward in the bracing wind, and the  clipper ship raced along with its burden of the wildest dreamers ever  borne in a vessel's hull! Up over long blue ocean ridges, down into long  blue ocean gullies; on to lands so new, and yet so old, where above the  sunny glow of the southern skies blazed the shining names of Ballarat!  and Bendigo! The deck seemed to lurch, and the fossicker fell forward  against the face of the drive. The shock recalled him, and he lifted his  pick once more.    But the blows slacken again as another vision rises before him. It is  Ballarat now. He is working in a shallow claim at Eureka, his brother by  his side. The brother looks pale and ill, for he has been up all night  dancing and drinking. "]]]
