This was not the first sun to find me at these holy feet!    My hand in his, my guru led me to his temporary residence in the  Rana Mahal section of the city. His athletic figure moved with firm  tread.  Tall, erect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active  and vigorous as a young man. His dark eyes were large, beautiful with  plumbless wisdom. Slightly curly hair softened a face of striking  power.  Strength mingled subtly with gentleness.    As we made our way to the stone balcony of a house overlooking the  Ganges, he said affectionately:    \"I will give you my hermitages and all I possess.\"    \"Sir, I come for wisdom and God-contact. Those are your treasure-troves  I am after!\"    The swift Indian twilight had dropped its half-curtain before my  master spoke again. His eyes held unfathomable tenderness.    \"I give you my unconditional love.\"    Precious words! A quarter-century elapsed before I had another  auricular proof of his love. His lips were strange to ardor; silence  became his oceanic heart.    \"Will you give me the same unconditional love?\" He gazed at me with  childlike trust.    \"I will love you eternally, Gurudeva!\"    \"Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions.  Divine love is without condition, without boundary, without change.  The flux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch  of pure love.\" He added humbly, \"If ever you find me falling from  a state of God-realization, please promise to put my head on your  lap and help to bring me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship.\"    He rose then in the gathering darkness and guided me to an inner  room.  As we ate mangoes and almond sweetmeats, he unobtrusively  wove into his conversation an intimate knowledge of my nature. I  was awe-struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended  with an innate humility.    \"Do not grieve for your amulet. It has served its purpose.\" Like  a divine mirror, my guru apparently had caught a reflection of my  whole life.    \"The living reality of your presence, Master, is joy beyond any  symbol.\"    \"It is time for a change, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated  in the hermitage.\"    I had made no references to my life; they now seemed superfluous!  By his natural, unemphatic manner, I understood that he wished no  astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance.    \"You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your  love of humanity?\"    His suggestion dismayed me. My family was predicting my return,  though I had been unresponsive to many pleas by letter. \"Let the  young bird fly in the metaphysical skies,\" Ananta had remarked.  \"His wings will tire in the heavy atmosphere. We shall yet see him  swoop toward home, fold his pinions, and humbly rest in our family  nest.\" This discouraging simile fresh in my mind, I was determined  to do no \"swooping\" in the direction of Calcutta.    \"Sir, I am not returning home. But I will follow you anywhere.  Please give me your address, and your name.\"    \"Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. My chief hermitage is in Serampore, on  Rai Ghat Lane. I am visiting my mother here for only a few days.\"    I wondered at God's intricate play with His devotees. Serampore is  but twelve miles from Calcutta, yet in those regions I had never  caught a glimpse of my guru. We had had to travel for our meeting  to the ancient city of Kasi (Benares), hallowed by memories of  Lahiri Mahasaya. Here too the feet of Buddha, Shankaracharya and  other Yogi--Christs had blessed the soil.    \"You will come to me in four weeks.\" For the first time, Sri  Yukteswar's voice was stern. \"Now I have told my eternal affection,  and have shown my happiness at finding you-that is why you disregard  my request. The next time we meet, you will have to reawaken my  interest: I won't accept you as a disciple easily. There must be  complete surrender by obedience to my strict training.\"    I remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my  difficulty.    \"Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?\"    \"I will not return.\"    \"You will return in thirty days.\"    \"Never.\" Bowing reverently at his feet, I departed without lightening  the controversial tension. As I made my way in the midnight darkness,  I wondered why the miraculous meeting had ended on an inharmonious  note. The dual scales of MAYA, that balance every joy with a grief!  My young heart was not yet malleable to the transforming fingers  of my guru.    The next morning I noticed increased hostility in the attitude  of the hermitage members. My days became spiked with invariable  rudeness. In three weeks, Dyananda left the ashram to attend a  conference in Bombay; pandemonium broke over my hapless head.    \"Mukunda is a parasite, accepting hermitage hospitality without  making proper return.\" Overhearing this remark, I regretted for the  first time that I had obeyed the request to send back my money to  Father.  With heavy heart, I sought out my sole friend, Jitendra.    \"I am leaving. Please convey my respectful regrets to Dyanandaji  when he returns.\"    \"I will leave also! My attempts to meditate here meet with no more  favor than your own.\" Jitendra spoke with determination.    \"I have met a Christlike saint. Let us visit him in Serampore.\"    And so the \"bird\" prepared to \"swoop\" perilously close to Calcutta!    {FN10-1} SANSKRITA, polished; complete. Sanskrit is the eldest  sister of all Indo-European tongues. Its alphabetical script is  DEVANAGARI, literally \"divine abode.\" \"Who knows my grammar knows  God!\" Panini, great philologist of ancient India, paid this tribute  to the mathematical and psychological perfection in Sanskrit. He  who would track language to its lair must indeed end as omniscient.    {FN10-2} He was not Jatinda (Jotin Ghosh), who will be remembered  for his timely aversion to tigers!    {FN10-3} Path or preliminary road to God.    {FN10-4} Hindu scriptures teach that family attachment is delusive  if it prevents the devotee from seeking the Giver of all boons,  including the one of loving relatives, not to mention life itself.  Jesus similarly taught: \"Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?\"  (MATTHEW 12:48.)    {FN10-5} JI is a customary respectful suffix, particularly used  in direct address; thus \"swamiji,\" \"guruji,\" \"Sri Yukteswarji,\"  \"paramhansaji.\"    {FN10-6} Pertaining to the SHASTRAS, literally, \"sacred books,\"  comprising four classes of scripture: the SHRUTI, SMRITI, PURANA,  and TANTRA. These comprehensive treatises cover every aspect  of religious and social life, and the fields of law, medicine,  architecture, art, etc. The SHRUTIS are the \"directly heard\" or  \"revealed\" scriptures, the VEDAS. The SMRITIS or \"remembered\" lore  was finally written down in a remote past as the world's longest  epic poems, the MAHABHARATA and the RAMAYANA. PURANAS are literally  \"ancient\" allegories; TANTRAS literally mean \"rites\" or \"rituals\";  these treatises convey profound truths under a veil of detailed  symbolism.    {FN10-7} \"Divine teacher,\" the customary Sanskrit term for one's  spiritual preceptor. I have rendered it in English as simply  \"Master.\"        CHAPTER: 11    TWO PENNILESS BOYS IN BRINDABAN    \"It would serve you right if Father disinherited you, Mukunda! How  foolishly you are throwing away your life!\" An elder-brother sermon  was assaulting my ears.    Jitendra and I, fresh from the train (a figure of speech merely;  we were covered with dust), had just arrived at the home of Ananta,  recently transferred from Calcutta to the ancient city of Agra.  Brother was a supervising accountant for the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.    \"You well know, Ananta, I seek my inheritance from the Heavenly  Father.\"    \"Money first; God can come later! Who knows? Life may be too long.\"    \"God first; money is His slave! Who can tell? Life may be too  short.\"    My retort was summoned by the exigencies of the moment, and held  no presentiment. Yet the leaves of time unfolded to early finality  for Ananta; a few years later {FN11-1} he entered the land where  bank notes avail neither first nor last.    \"Wisdom from the hermitage, I suppose! But I see you have left  Benares.\" Ananta's eyes gleamed with satisfaction; he yet hoped to  secure my pinions in the family nest.    \"My sojourn in Benares was not in vain! I found there everything my  heart had been longing for! You may be sure it was not your pundit  or his son!\"    Ananta joined me in reminiscent laughter; he had had to admit that  the Benares \"clairvoyant\" he selected was a shortsighted one.    \"What are your plans, my wandering brother?\"    \"Jitendra persuaded me to Agra. We shall view the beauties of the  Taj Mahal {FN11-2} here,\" I explained. \"Then we are going to my  newly-found guru, who has a hermitage in Serampore.\"    Ananta hospitably arranged for our comfort. Several times during  the evening I noticed his eyes fixed on me reflectively.    \"I know that look!\" I thought. \"A plot is brewing!\"    The denouement took place during our early breakfast.    \"So you feel quite independent of Father's wealth.\" Ananta's gaze  was innocent as he resumed the barbs of yesterday's conversation.    \"I am conscious of my dependence on God.\"    \"Words are cheap! Life has shielded you thus far! What a plight  if you were forced to look to the Invisible Hand for your food and  shelter!  You would soon be begging on the streets!\"    \"Never! I would not put faith in passers-by rather than God! He can  devise for His devotee a thousand resources besides the begging-bowl!\"    \"More rhetoric! Suppose I suggest that your vaunted philosophy be  put to a test in this tangible world?\"      \"I would agree! Do you confine God to a speculative world?\"    \"We shall see; today you shall have opportunity either to enlarge  or to confirm my own views!\" Ananta paused for a dramatic moment;  then spoke slowly and seriously.    \"I propose "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#19)"],[1,"at the very  idea, spoke warmly of the danger to her grandfather's nervous system,  and said she did not think the Bear-Cat could be a nice friend for Ted.  And matters relapsed into their old state of hopelessness.    And then, one day, Katie forced herself to tell Ted that she thought it  would be better if they did not see each other for a time. She said  that these meetings were only a source of pain to both of them. It  would really be better if he did not come round for--well, quite some  time.    It had not been easy for her to say it. The decision was the outcome of  many wakeful nights. She had asked herself the question whether it was  fair for her to keep Ted chained to her in this hopeless fashion, when,  left to himself and away from her, he might so easily find some other  girl to make him happy.    So Ted went, reluctantly, and the little shop on Sixth Avenue knew him  no more. And Katie spent her time looking after old Mr Bennett (who had  completely forgotten the affair by now, and sometimes wondered why  Katie was not so cheerful as she had been), and--for, though unselfish,  she was human--hating those unknown girls whom in her mind's eye she  could see clustering round Ted, smiling at him, making much of him, and  driving the bare recollection of her out of his mind.    The summer passed. July came and went, making New York an oven. August  followed, and one wondered why one had complained of July's tepid  advances.    It was on the evening of September the eleventh that Katie, having  closed the little shop, sat in the dusk on the steps, as many thousands  of her fellow-townsmen and townswomen were doing, turning her face to  the first breeze which New York had known for two months. The hot spell  had broken abruptly that afternoon, and the city was drinking in the  coolness as a flower drinks water.    From round the corner, where the yellow cross of the Judson Hotel shone  down on Washington Square, came the shouts of children, and the  strains, mellowed by distance, of the indefatigable barrel-organ which  had played the same tunes in the same place since the spring.    Katie closed her eyes, and listened. It was very peaceful this evening,  so peaceful that for an instant she forgot even to think of Ted. And it  was just during this instant that she heard his voice.    'That you, kid?'    He was standing before her, his hands in his pockets, one foot on the  pavement, the other in the road; and if he was agitated, his voice did  not show it.    'Ted!'    'That's me. Can I see the old man for a minute, Katie?'    This time it did seem to her that she could detect a slight ring of  excitement.    'It's no use, Ted. Honest.'    'No harm in going in and passing the time of day, is there? I've got  something I want to say to him.'    'What?'    'Tell you later, maybe. Is he in his room?'    He stepped past her, and went in. As he went, he caught her arm and  pressed it, but he did not stop. She saw him go into the inner room and  heard through the door as he closed it behind him, the murmur of  voices. And almost immediately, it seemed to her, her name was called.  It was her grandfather's voice which called, high and excited. The door  opened, and Ted appeared.    'Come here a minute, Katie, will you?' he said. 'You're wanted.'    The old man was leaning forward in his chair. He was in a state of  extraordinary excitement. He quivered and jumped. Ted, standing by the  wall, looked as stolid as ever; but his eyes glittered.    'Katie,' cried the old man, 'this is a most remarkable piece of news.  This gentleman has just been telling me--extraordinary. He--'    He broke off, and looked at Ted, as he had looked at Katie when he had  tried to write the letter to the Parliament of England.    Ted's eye, as it met Katie's, was almost defiant.    'I want to marry you,' he said.    'Yes, yes,' broke in Mr Bennett, impatiently, 'but--'    'And I'm a king.'    'Yes, yes, that's it, that's it, Katie. This gentleman is a king.'    Once more Ted's eye met Katie's, and this time there was an imploring  look in it.    'That's right,' he said, slowly. 'I've just been telling your  grandfather I'm the King of Coney Island.'    'That's it. Of Coney Island.'    'So there's no objection now to us getting married, kid--Your Royal  Highness. It's a royal alliance, see?'    'A royal alliance,' echoed Mr Bennett.    Out in the street, Ted held Katie's hand, and grinned a little  sheepishly.    'You're mighty quiet, kid,' he said. 'It looks as if it don't make much  of a hit with you, the notion of being married to me.'    'Oh, Ted! But--'    He squeezed her hand.    'I know what you're thinking. I guess it was raw work pulling a tale  like that on the old man. I hated to do it, but gee! when a fellow's up  against it like I was, he's apt to grab most any chance that comes  along. Why, say, kid, it kind of looked to me as if it was sort of  _meant_. Coming just now, like it did, just when it was wanted,  and just when it didn't seem possible it could happen. Why, a week ago  I was nigh on two hundred votes behind Billy Burton. The Irish-American  put him up, and everybody thought he'd be King at the Mardi Gras. And  then suddenly they came pouring in for me, till at the finish I had  Billy looking like a regular has-been.    'It's funny the way the voting jumps about every year in this Coney  election. It was just Providence, and it didn't seem right to let it go  by. So I went in to the old man, and told him. Say, I tell you I was  just sweating when I got ready to hand it to him. It was an outside  chance he'd remember all about what the Mardi Gras at Coney was, and  just what being a king at it amounted to. Then I remembered you telling  me you'd never been to Coney, so I figured your grandfather wouldn't be  what you'd call well fixed in his information about it, so I took the  chance.    'I tried him out first. I tried him with Brooklyn. Why, say, from the  way he took it, he'd either never heard of the place, or else he'd  forgotten what it was. I guess he don't remember much, poor old fellow.  Then I mentioned Yonkers. He asked me what Yonkers were. Then I  reckoned it was safe to bring on Coney, and he fell for it right away.  I felt mean, but it had to be done.'    He caught her up, and swung her into the air with a perfectly impassive  face. Then, having kissed her, he lowered her gently to the ground  again. The action seemed to have relieved his feelings, for when he  spoke again it was plain that his conscience no longer troubled him.    'And say,' he said, 'come to think of it, I don't see where there's so  much call for me to feel mean. I'm not so far short of being a regular  king. Coney's just as big as some of those kingdoms you read about on  the other side; and, from what you see in the papers about the  goings-on there, it looks to me that, having a whole week on the throne  like I'm going to have, amounts to a pretty steady job as kings go.'          AT GEISENHEIMER'S      As I walked to Geisenheimer's that night I was feeling blue and  restless, tired of New York, tired of dancing, tired of everything.  Broadway was full of people hurrying to the theatres. Cars rattled by.  All the electric lights in the world were blazing down on the Great  White Way. And it all seemed stale and dreary to me.    Geisenheimer's was full as usual. All the tables were occupied, and  there were several couples already on the dancing-floor in the centre.  The band was playing 'Michigan':         _I want to go back, I want to go back       To the place where I was born.       Far away from harm       With a milk-pail on my arm._    I suppose the fellow who wrote that would have called for the police if  anyone had ever really tried to get him on to a farm, but he has  certainly put something into the tune which makes you think he meant  what he said. It's a homesick tune, that.    I was just looking round for an empty table, when a man jumped up and  came towards me, registering joy as if I had been his long-lost sister.    He was from the country. I could see that. It was written all over him,  from his face to his shoes.    He came up with his hand out, beaming.    'Why, Miss Roxborough!'    'Why not?' I said.    'Don't you remember me?'    I didn't.    'My name is Ferris.'    'It's a nice name, but it means nothing in my young life.'    'I was introduced to you last time I came here. We danced together.'    This seemed to bear the stamp of truth. If he was introduced to me, he  probably danced with me. It's what I'm at Geisenheimer's for.    'When was it?'    'A year ago last April.'    You can't beat these rural charmers. They think New York is folded up  and put away in camphor when they leave, and only taken out again when  they pay their next visit. The notion that anything could possibly have  happened since he was last in our midst to blur the memory of that  happy evening had not occurred to Mr Ferris. I suppose he was so  accustomed to dating things from 'when I was in New York' that he  thought everybody else must do the same.    'Why, sure, I remember you,' I said. 'Algernon Clarence, isn't it?'    'Not Algernon Clarence. My name's Charlie.'    'My mistake. And what's the great scheme, Mr Ferris? Do you want to  dance with me again?'    He did. So we started. Mine not to reason why, mine but to do and die,  as the poem says. If an elephant had come into Geisenheimer's and asked  me to dance I'd have had to do it. And I'm not saying that Mr Ferris  wasn't the next thing to it. He was one of those earnest, persevering  dancers--the kind that have taken twelve correspondence lessons.    I guess I was about due that night to meet someone from the country.  There still come days in the spring when the country seems to get a  stranglehold on me and start in pulling. This particular day had been  one of them. I got up in the morning and looked out of the window, and  the breeze just wrapped me"]]]
