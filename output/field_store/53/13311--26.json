Had she not already given the best years of her youth to  others? Had she not waited without a thought of rebellion for the  coming of the right one? And Love, and Love's mysterious touch,  wrought fantastic changes in Stella Beckman's affairs. She and Lee  read poetry. She had never known how beautiful poetry was nor how much  of it there was to read. He knew the good novels and sent her all that  he himself read, and these were plenty! Then, when he was away, he  wrote and she wrote, and now and then he wrote some verses to her.  There was no real engagement. They never spoke much of the future; the  present was too full. Home duties and church interests flagged badly  during these two years, and the summer she was twenty-four, it became  town talk that this young couple would marry. The Beckmans were very  willing. But one day the judge called Lee into his office and wanted  to know what these \"doings\" all meant, asking him if he was \"going to  marry his mother,\" and making some rather uncomplimentary Beckman-  Burnham comparisons. Lee rather sheepishly told his father there was  nothing to worry about. He had much respect, possibly awe, for the old  gentleman. The next week Lee left for his final year in law-school.  His letters to Stella continued, though he plead his studies as an  excuse for their diminished frequency. He did not come home that  spring, at Easter. \"Work,\" he wrote Stella. Nor was he ever square to  this poor girl, for he never mentioned his relations with Miss Pearl  May Rogers. And \"shock number three\" came, as unhappy Stella read the  announcement of his marriage, addressed in the hand of his June city-  bride. A lastingly damaging shock it proved to be.    Stella was put to bed; for days she lay in deep apathy. Feeding became  a problem of nurses and doctors. She cared for nothing--nothing  \"agreed\" with her, and she lost weight rapidly. Chills and flushes,  sweatings and shakings came in regular disorder, and for hours she  would be apparently speechless. Somebody--not the doctors--reported  that Stella Beckman had typho-malaria. Abnormal sensitiveness to  surroundings, to sounds, sights and smells, especially a dread of  unpleasant news, were to complicate her living for years to come. For  the remainder of her life she was to confound sensations normal to  emotional reactions with sensations accompanying physical diseases;  and sensations came and went in her now tense emotional nature like  trooping clouds on a stormy day. Stella's illness was so prostrating  that her weakened mother and busy sister could not care for her  adequately, and an aunt came to help. Recovery was slow and imperfect;  she remained a semi-invalid for two and a half years. Physical  discomforts were so constant that a surgeon was finally consulted who  did an exploratory operation and removed some unnecessary anatomy.  This man's personality was strong, his desire to help, genuine, and he  had considerable insight into the emotional illness of his patient.  The influence of the operation, with the surgeon's encouragement and  the atmosphere of confidence pervading the excellent, small surgical  hospital, combined to make Stella very much better for the time. But  within less than three years, her father died. She calls this \"the  fourth shock,\" and it resulted in another period of nervous illness.  She cried much at the time. Work was impossible--as was all exercise  --because of her rapid fatigue. One day she slipped on the front steps  and, apparently, but bruised her knee. Her doctor nor the X-ray could  discover more serious damage. Still, walking was practically  discontinued, as she could not step without pain. At last, almost in  desperation, her brother took her to a hospital noted for its success  in reconstructing nervous invalids. At this time she weighed but one  hundred and four, and the list of her symptoms seemed unending. A  desire to be helped, however, was discerned and with rest-treatment  she gained rapidly in weight, appetite returned, digestive  disturbances disappeared, and massage, or a new idea, fully restored  her walking powers. She became eager for the more important half of  her treatment--the out-of-door work-cure. During these weeks she had  certainly been given much physical and mental help. Expert and  specialized counsel and nursing had been hers.    At the end of five months Stella returned to Georgia--restored--a  health enthusiast. It now became her joy, in and out of season,  whenever she could secure hearers, to relate the details of her  illness and the miracle of her restoration. The methods of the special  hospital that wrought such wonders for her were reiterated in detail,  and for years she made herself thoroughly wearisome by her talk of  diet and exercise, special bathing, out-of-door work and prescribed  habits. She kept herself constantly conspicuous in her efforts to  reform others to her new ways of living. For over four years, she  sedulously adhered to the routine outlined by the hospital, with such  devotion to, and augmentation of, details that she had little time for  church and practically no time for household affairs. As had been her  habit in past experiences her enthusiasm was causing her to overdo,  and the business of keeping well seemed now her only object in life.  This could not go on interminably. Something had to happen, and her  mother's rather sudden death proved the shock which was to relieve her  from the overenthusiastic slavery to an impracticable routine.    Stella Beckman at forty-five is sadly less fine and worthy than the  Stella Beckman of eighteen. Religion, Love and Science have each  entered her life deeply to enrich it, but all of these built upon the  sands, the shifting sands of an emotional nature which had never laid  the granite foundation of reason. Since the mother's death, the logic  of her feelings has become more and more crippled by false valuations.  She lives at home keeping house for the boys, recounting each mealtime  the endless list of her feelings; bringing herself, her sickness, her  hospital experiences wearisomely into the conversation with each  caller. The emotional stability and the will to persevere even at  considerable cost, which marked youth, are gone. At forty-five her  life is objectlessly spasmodic, the old family-habit of talking of  self and the family-fetish of discussing sickness have honeycombed her  character and made her hopelessly tiresome. And her feeling-life is as  restless as a troubled sea.          CHAPTER XIII    WILLING ILLNESS      Mr. Harrison Orr lived till he was twenty-five in Indianapolis, the  town of his birth, excepting the years spent in Chicago pursuing his  literary and law courses. He inherited a small fortune and, after two  years spent in \"seeing the world,\" located in Memphis, Tennessee.  Here, as an attorney and later as an investor, he was professionally,  financially and socially successful. His father had been liberal in  the use of wines and cordials, and young Orr himself always remained a  \"good fellow,\" just the kind of a man to attract a vivacious, socially  proud daughter of the South. He was thirty-five when he married--  accounted an age of discretion. His experience with womankind was so  ample that he should have made no mistake in his final, irrevocable  choice, and, be it said to his honor, no one, not even the wife  herself, ever knew by word or act of his, to the contrary. He and his  Mississippi bride spent thirty years in apparent domestic  tranquillity, until he died at sixty-five from a heart which refused  longer to have its claims for purposeful living eternally answered by  gin rickeys and nips of \"straight Scotch.\"    Mrs. Harrison Orr is unconsciously the unhappy \"villain\" of our tale.  Her girlhood home was on a large sugar-plantation where she, as an  only child, was reared to dominate her surroundings, while her parents  made particular effort that she might shine socially. Parts of many  years she lived in Washington in the home of a political relative, and  attended a select girls' school. After her debut she spent the social  winters at the Capitol where social niceties were developed with much  attention to detail, and at home and while in Washington she was  gratifyingly popular. \"A brilliant conversationalist,\" she had heard  herself called when fifteen, and the art of conversation, hitherto far  from neglected, became by choice and practice her forte. Brilliancy in  speech ever remained her only seriously attempted accomplishment.  Clever of speech, from childhood, she had early learned to utilize  this ability to attain any desired end. And talk she could, and talk  she did, and as she grew older, by sheer talking she domineered every  situation. It was her opinion when she married that at any time, with  any listener, she could talk cleverly on any subject. As the years  passed, during which she added little to her asset of knowledge, this  art of fine speech gradually, but relentlessly, degenerated, and step  by step she slipped down the paths of delicacy and fineness, through  the selfishness of her insistent talkativeness. Harrison Orr never  intimated that his evenings at home were hours of boredom, but in  later years spent much time in the comparative quiet of his club. Few  intellects can be so amply stored as to continue brilliant through  decades of much speaking, and the sparkle of Mrs. Orr's conversation  was gradually shrouded in the weariness of what a blunt neighbor  termed her \"inveterate gabble.\" As it must be, this woman of  exceptional opportunities early lost true sensitiveness, and, both as  guest and hostess, ignored the offense of inconsiderate and self-  seeking interruptions. She broke into the speech of others with crude  abandon. The itch to lead and preempt the conversation became  uncontrollable. Finer natures thrown with her could but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#19)"],[1,"it is the concensus of opinion on the part of all  those competent to speak upon the subject, that he was not a student of  books. But what is most important of all, and what settles the question  on this point (whether Joseph Smith, Solomon Spaulding, or Sidney  Rigdon be regarded as the author) is the fact that the means through  which to obtain the necessary knowledge of American antiquities, the  body of literature in English now at one's command on the subject, was  not then (1823-1830) in existence. The Spanish and native American  writers previous to 1830 may be dismissed from consideration at  once, since their works could not be available to Joseph Smith and  his associates because written in a language unknown to them, and  such fragmentary translations of them as existed were so rare as to  be inaccessible to men of western New York and Ohio. About the only  works to which Joseph Smith could possibly have had access before the  publication of the Book of Mormon would have been:    First, the publications of the \"American Antiquarian Society,  Translations and Collections,\" published in the \"Archaeoligia  Americana,\" Worcester, Massachusetts, 1820; but this information was  so fragmentary in character that it could not possibly have supplied  the historical incidents of the Book of Mormon, or the customs of its  peoples, even could it be proven that Joseph Smith had been familiar  with that collection.    Second, the little work of Ethan Smith, published in Vermont--second  edition 1825--in which the author holds the native American Indian  tribes to be descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel. In fact his  work bears the title, \"View of the Hebrews; or the Tribes of Israel in  America.\"    Third, \"The History of the American Indians,\" by James Adair, published  in England, 1775. Mr. Adair confines the scope of his work to the North  American Indians.    Fourth. The translation of some parts of Humboldt's works on New Spain,  published first in America and England between the years 1806 and 1809,  and later Black's enlarged translation of them in New York, 1811.    These are the only works, so far as I can ascertain, that could at  all be accessible to Joseph Smith or any of his associates; and there  is no evidence that the Prophet or his associates ever saw any one  of them. Moreover, notwithstanding some of these writers advance the  theory that the native Americans are descendants of the ten lost  tribes of Israel, and their books contain fragmentary and disconnected  information concerning American antiquities--no one acquainted with  these works could possibly regard them as being the source whence Book  of Mormon incidents or customs of Book of Mormon peoples were drawn,  a fact which will be more apparent after we have considered--as we  shall later consider--the originality of the Book of Mormon. Since,  therefore, from the very nature of all the circumstances surrounding  the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, neither Joseph Smith nor his  associates could possibly have become acquainted with the location of  the chief centers of ancient American civilizations, nor with native  American traditions and customs, it must be evident that Book of Mormon  historical incidents and the customs of Book of Mormon peoples were not  derived from works on American antiquities and traditions.    VIII.    _The Value of the Evidence Supplied by American Antiquities_    The evidence I have to offer from American antiquities is now before  the reader. Not all the evidence that could be massed upon the subject,  but all that my space in this work will permit me to present. I do not  claim that the evidence is either as full or perfect as one could wish  it to be, nor that it is free from what some will regard as serious  difficulties; but this much I feel can be insisted upon:    The evidence establishes the fact of the existence of ancient  civilizations in America; that the said civilizations are successive;  that their monuments, overlay each other, and are confused by a  subsequent period of barbarism; that the monuments of the chief centers  of American civilizations are found where the Book of Mormon requires  them to be located; that the traditions of the native Americans  concerning ancient Bible facts, such as relate to the creation, the  flood, the Tower of Babel, and the dispersion of mankind, etc., sustain  the likelihood of the forefathers of our American aborigines, in  very ancient times, being cognizant of such facts either by personal  contact with them, or by having a knowledge of them through the Hebrew  scriptures, or perhaps through both means. All this is in harmony with  what the Book of Mormon makes known concerning the Jaredite and Nephite  peoples; for the forefathers of the former people were in personal  contact with the building of Babel, the confusion of languages and  the dispersion of mankind; while the Nephites had knowledge of these  and many other ancient historical facts through the Hebrew scriptures  which they brought with them to America. The evidences presented  also disclose the fact that the native American traditions preserve  the leading historical events of the Book of Mormon. That is, the  facts of the Jaredite and Nephite migrations; of the intercontinental  movements of Book of Mormon peoples; of the advent and character of  Messiah, and his ministrations among the people; of the signs of his  birth and of his death; of the fact of the Hebrew origin and unity of  the race. All these facts so strong in the support of the claims of  the Book of Mormon--whatever else of confusion may exist in American  antiquities--I feel sure can not be moved. It should be remembered, in  this connection, that it is not insisted upon in these pages that the  evidences which American antiquities afford are absolute proofs of the  claims of the Book of Mormon. I go no further than to say there is a  tendency of external proof in them; and when this tendency of proof  is united with the positive, direct external testimony which God has  provided in those Witnesses that he himself has ordained to establish  the truth of the Book of Mormon, the Three Witnesses and the Eight,  this tendency of proof becomes very strong, and is worthy of most  serious attention on the part of those who would investigate the claims  of this American volume of scripture.

In describing how the brother  of Jared melted from the rock sixteen small stones it is said they were  white and clear \"even as transparent glass\" of which the late Orson  Pratt in a foot note says: \"From this it is evident that the art of  making glass was known at that early period.\" Ether iii: 1, and note  \"a.\"    9.
