I have little doubt that the idea has been put into  his head by others.  If there are people in this village, Mr. Dempster,  who have forgotten the respect and gratitude due from every soul in it  to my mother's memory, I will find them out, and if I have any  influence with Mr. Fairlie, they shall suffer for it.\"    \"I hope--indeed, I am sure, Miss Halcombe--that you are mistaken,\" said  the schoolmaster.  \"The matter begins and ends with the boy's own  perversity and folly.  He saw, or thought he saw, a woman in white,  yesterday evening, as he was passing the churchyard; and the figure,  real or fancied, was standing by the marble cross, which he and every  one else in Limmeridge knows to be the monument over Mrs. Fairlie's  grave.  These two circumstances are surely sufficient to have suggested  to the boy himself the answer which has so naturally shocked you?\"    Although Miss Halcombe did not seem to be convinced, she evidently felt  that the schoolmaster's statement of the case was too sensible to be  openly combated.  She merely replied by thanking him for his attention,  and by promising to see him again when her doubts were satisfied.  This  said, she bowed, and led the way out of the schoolroom.    Throughout the whole of this strange scene I had stood apart, listening  attentively, and drawing my own conclusions.  As soon as we were alone  again, Miss Halcombe asked me if I had formed any opinion on what I had  heard.    \"A very strong opinion,\" I answered; \"the boy's story, as I believe,  has a foundation in fact.  I confess I am anxious to see the monument  over Mrs. Fairlie's grave, and to examine the ground about it.\"    \"You shall see the grave.\"    She paused after making that reply, and reflected a little as we walked  on.  \"What has happened in the schoolroom,\" she resumed, \"has so  completely distracted my attention from the subject of the letter, that  I feel a little bewildered when I try to return to it.  Must we give up  all idea of making any further inquiries, and wait to place the thing  in Mr. Gilmore's hands to-morrow?\"    \"By no means, Miss Halcombe.  What has happened in the schoolroom  encourages me to persevere in the investigation.\"    \"Why does it encourage you?\"    \"Because it strengthens a suspicion I felt when you gave me the letter  to read.\"    \"I suppose you had your reasons, Mr. Hartright, for concealing that  suspicion from me till this moment?\"    \"I was afraid to encourage it in myself.  I thought it was utterly  preposterous--I distrusted it as the result of some perversity in my  own imagination.  But I can do so no longer.  Not only the boy's own  answers to your questions, but even a chance expression that dropped  from the schoolmaster's lips in explaining his story, have forced the  idea back into my mind.  Events may yet prove that idea to be a  delusion, Miss Halcombe; but the belief is strong in me, at this  moment, that the fancied ghost in the churchyard, and the writer of the  anonymous letter, are one and the same person.\"    She stopped, turned pale, and looked me eagerly in the face.    \"What person?\"    \"The schoolmaster unconsciously told you.  When he spoke of the figure  that the boy saw in the churchyard he called it 'a woman in white.'\"    \"Not Anne Catherick?\"    \"Yes, Anne Catherick.\"    She put her hand through my arm and leaned on it heavily.    \"I don't know why,\" she said in low tones, \"but there is something in  this suspicion of yours that seems to startle and unnerve me. I  feel----\" She stopped, and tried to laugh it off.  \"Mr. Hartright,\" she  went on, \"I will show you the grave, and then go back at once to the  house.  I had better not leave Laura too long alone.  I had better go  back and sit with her.\"    We were close to the churchyard when she spoke.  The church, a dreary  building of grey stone, was situated in a little valley, so as to be  sheltered from the bleak winds blowing over the moorland all round it.  The burial-ground advanced, from the side of the church, a little way  up the slope of the hill.  It was surrounded by a rough, low stone  wall, and was bare and open to the sky, except at one extremity, where  a brook trickled down the stony hill-side, and a clump of dwarf trees  threw their narrow shadows over the short, meagre grass.  Just beyond  the brook and the trees, and not far from one of the three stone stiles  which afforded entrance, at various points, to the churchyard, rose the  white marble cross that distinguished Mrs. Fairlie's grave from the  humbler monuments scattered about it.    \"I need go no farther with you,\" said Miss Halcombe, pointing to the  grave.  \"You will let me know if you find anything to confirm the idea  you have just mentioned to me.  Let us meet again at the house.\"    She left me.  I descended at once to the churchyard, and crossed the  stile which led directly to Mrs. Fairlie's grave.    The grass about it was too short, and the ground too hard, to show any  marks of footsteps.  Disappointed thus far, I next looked attentively  at the cross, and at the square block of marble below it, on which the  inscription was cut.    The natural whiteness of the cross was a little clouded, here and  there, by weather stains, and rather more than one half of the square  block beneath it, on the side which bore the inscription, was in the  same condition.  The other half, however, attracted my attention at  once by its singular freedom from stain or impurity of any kind.  I  looked closer, and saw that it had been cleaned--recently cleaned, in a  downward direction from top to bottom.  The boundary line between the  part that had been cleaned and the part that had not was traceable  wherever the inscription left a blank space of marble--sharply  traceable as a line that had been produced by artificial means.  Who  had begun the cleansing of the marble, and who had left it unfinished?    I looked about me, wondering how the question was to be solved. No sign  of a habitation could be discerned from the point at which I was  standing--the burial-ground was left in the lonely possession of the  dead.  I returned to the church, and walked round it till I came to the  back of the building; then crossed the boundary wall beyond, by another  of the stone stiles, and found myself at the head of a path leading  down into a deserted stone quarry.  Against one side of the quarry a  little two-room cottage was built, and just outside the door an old  woman was engaged in washing.    I walked up to her, and entered into conversation about the church and  burial-ground.  She was ready enough to talk, and almost the first  words she said informed me that her husband filled the two offices of  clerk and sexton.  I said a few words next in praise of Mrs. Fairlie's  monument.  The old woman shook her head, and told me I had not seen it  at its best.  It was her husband's business to look after it, but he  had been so ailing and weak for months and months past, that he had  hardly been able to crawl into church on Sundays to do his duty, and  the monument had been neglected in consequence.  He was getting a  little better now, and in a week or ten days' time he hoped to be  strong enough to set to work and clean it.    This information--extracted from a long rambling answer in the broadest  Cumberland dialect--told me all that I most wanted to know.  I gave the  poor woman a trifle, and returned at once to Limmeridge House.    The partial cleansing of the monument had evidently been accomplished  by a strange hand.  Connecting what I had discovered, thus far, with  what I had suspected after hearing the story of the ghost seen at  twilight, I wanted nothing more to confirm my resolution to watch Mrs.  Fairlie's grave, in secret, that evening, returning to it at sunset,  and waiting within sight of it till the night fell.  The work of  cleansing the monument had been left unfinished, and the person by whom  it had been begun might return to complete it.    On getting back to the house I informed Miss Halcombe of what I  intended to do.  She looked surprised and uneasy while I was explaining  my purpose, but she made no positive objection to the execution of it.  She only said, \"I hope it may end well.\"    Just as she was leaving me again, I stopped her to inquire, as calmly  as I could, after Miss Fairlie's health.  She was in better spirits,  and Miss Halcombe hoped she might be induced to take a little walking  exercise while the afternoon sun lasted.    I returned to my own room to resume setting the drawings in order. It  was necessary to do this, and doubly necessary to keep my mind employed  on anything that would help to distract my attention from myself, and  from the hopeless future that lay before me.  From time to time I  paused in my work to look out of window and watch the sky as the sun  sank nearer and nearer to the horizon.  On one of those occasions I saw  a figure on the broad gravel walk under my window.  It was Miss Fairlie.    I had not seen her since the morning, and I had hardly spoken to her  then.  Another day at Limmeridge was all that remained to me, and after  that day my eyes might never look on her again.  This thought was  enough to hold me at the window.  I had sufficient consideration for  her to arrange the blind so that she might not see me if she looked up,  but I had no strength to resist the temptation of letting my eyes, at  least, follow her as far as they could on her walk.    She was dressed in a brown cloak, with a plain black silk gown under  it.  On her head was the same simple straw hat which she had worn on  the morning when we first met.  A veil was attached to it now which hid  her face from me.  By her side trotted a little Italian greyhound, the  pet companion of all her walks, smartly dressed in a scarlet cloth  wrapper, to keep the sharp air from his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#19)"],[1," to the broad verandah of  Hatton and Cookson's factory, and I sit down under a lamp, prepared  to contemplate, until dinner time, the wild beauty of the scene.  This idea does not get carried out; in the twinkling of an eye I am  stung all round the neck, and recognise there are lots too many  mosquitoes and sandflies in the scenery to permit of contemplation  of any kind.  Never have I seen sandflies and mosquitoes in such  appalling quantities.  With a wild ping of joy the latter made for  me, and I retired promptly into a dark corner of the verandah,  swearing horribly, but internally, and fought them.  Mr. Hudson,  Agent-general, and Mr. Cockshut, Agent for the Ogowe, walk up and  down the beach in front, doubtless talking cargo, apparently  unconscious of mosquitoes; but by and by, while we are having  dinner, they get their share.  I behave exquisitely, and am quite  lost in admiration of my own conduct, and busily deciding in my own  mind whether I shall wear one of those plain ring haloes, or a solid  plate one, a la Cimabue, when Mr. Hudson says in a voice full of  reproach to Mr. Cockshut, \"You have got mosquitoes here, Mr.  Cockshut.\"  Poor Mr. Cockshut doesn't deny it; he has got four on  his forehead and his hands are sprinkled with them, but he says:  \"There are none at Njole,\" which we all feel is an absurdly lame  excuse, for Njole is some ninety miles above Lembarene, where we now  are.  Mr. Hudson says this to him, tersely, and feeling he has  utterly crushed Mr. Cockshut, turns on me, and utterly failing to  recognise me as a suffering saint, says point blank and savagely,  \"You don't seem to feel these things, Miss Kingsley.\"  Not feel  them, indeed!  Why, I could cry over them.  Well! that's all the  thanks one gets for trying not to be a nuisance in this world.    After dinner I go back on to the Move for the night, for it is too  late to go round to Kangwe and ask Mme. Jacot, of the Mission  Evangelique, if she will take me in.  The air is stiff with  mosquitoes, and saying a few suitable words to them, I dash under  the mosquito bar and sleep, lulled by their shrill yells of baffled  rage.    June 8th.--In the morning, up at five.  Great activity on beach.  Move synchronously taking on wood fuel and discharging cargo.  A  very active young French pastor from the Kangwe mission station is  round after the mission's cargo.  Mr. Hudson kindly makes inquiries  as to whether I may go round to Kangwe and stay with Mme. Jacot.  He  says:  \"Oh, yes,\" but as I find he is not M. Jacot, I do not feel  justified in accepting this statement without its having personal  confirmation from Mme. Jacot, and so, leaving my luggage with the  Move, I get them to allow me to go round with him and his cargo to  Kangwe, about three-quarters of an hour's paddle round the upper  part of Lembarene Island, and down the broad channel on the other  side of it.  Kangwe is beautifully situated on a hill, as its name  denotes, on the mainland and north bank of the river.  Mme. Jacot  most kindly says I may come, though I know I shall be a fearful  nuisance, for there is no room for me save M. Jacot's beautifully  neat, clean, tidy study.  I go back in the canoe and fetch my  luggage from the Move; and say good-bye to Mr. Hudson, who gave me  an immense amount of valuable advice about things, which was  subsequently of great use to me, and a lot of equally good warnings  which, if I had attended to, would have enabled me to avoid many, if  not all, my misadventures in Congo Francais.    I camped out that night in M. Jacot's study, wondering how he would  like it when he came home and found me there; for he was now away on  one of his usual evangelising tours.  Providentially Mme. Jacot let  me have the room that the girls belonging to the mission school  usually slept in, to my great relief, before M. Jacot came home.    I will not weary you with my diary during my first stay at Kangwe.  It is a catalogue of the collection of fish, etc., that I made, and  a record of the continuous, never-failing kindness and help that I  received from M. and Mme. Jacot, and of my attempts to learn from  them the peculiarities of the region, the natives, and their  language and customs, which they both know so well and manage so  admirably.  I daily saw there what it is possible to do, even in the  wildest and most remote regions of West Africa, and recognised that  there is still one heroic form of human being whose praise has never  adequately been sung, namely, the missionary's wife.    Wishing to get higher up the Ogowe, I took the opportunity of the  river boat of the Chargeurs Reunis going up to the Njole on one of  her trips, and joined her.    June 22nd.--Eclaireur, charming little stern wheel steamer,  exquisitely kept.  She has an upper and a lower deck.  The lower  deck for business, the upper deck for white passengers only.  On the  upper deck there is a fine long deck-house, running almost her whole  length.  In this are the officers' cabins, the saloon and the  passengers' cabins (two), both large and beautifully fitted up.  Captain Verdier exceedingly pleasant and constantly saying \"N'est-ce  pas?\"  A quiet and singularly clean engineer completes the white  staff.    The passengers consist of Mr. Cockshut, going up river to see after  the sub-factories; a French official bound for Franceville, which it  will take him thirty-six days, go as quick as he can, in a canoe  after Njole; a tremendously lively person who has had black water  fever four times, while away in the bush with nothing to live on but  manioc, a diet it would be far easier to die on under the  circumstances.  He is excellent company; though I do not know a word  he says, he is perpetually giving lively and dramatic descriptions  of things which I cannot but recognise.  M. S---, with his pince-  nez, the Doctor, and, above all, the rapids of the Ogowe, rolling  his hands round and round each other and clashing them forward with  a descriptive ejaculation of \"Whish, flash, bum, bum, bump,\" and  then comes what evidently represents a terrific fight for life  against terrific odds.  Wish to goodness I knew French, for wishing  to see these rapids, I cannot help feeling anxious and worried at  not fully understanding this dramatic entertainment regarding them.  There is another passenger, said to be the engineer's brother, a  quiet, gentlemanly man.  Captain argues violently with every one;  with Mr. Cockshut on the subject of the wicked waste of money in  keeping the Move and not shipping all goods by the Eclaireur,  \"N'est-ce pas?\" and with the French official on goodness knows what,  but I fancy it will be pistols for two and coffee for one in the  morning time.  When the captain feels himself being worsted in  argument, he shouts for support to the engineer and his brother.  \"N'est-ce pas?\" he says, turning furiously to them.  \"Oui, oui,  certainement,\" they say dutifully and calmly, and then he, refreshed  by their support, dashes back to his controversial fray.  He even  tries to get up a row with me on the subject of the English  merchants at Calabar, whom he asserts have sworn a kind of blood  oath to ship by none but British and African Company's steamers.  I  cannot stand this, for I know my esteemed and honoured friends the  Calabar traders would ship by the Flying Dutchman or the Devil  himself if either of them would take the stuff at 15 shillings the  ton.  We have, however, to leave off this row for want of language,  to our mutual regret, for it would have been a love of a fight.    Soon after leaving Lembarene Island, we pass the mouth of the chief  southern affluent of the Ogowe, the Ngunie; it flows in  unostentatiously from the E.S.E., a broad, quiet river here with low  banks and two islands (Walker's Islands) showing just off its  entrance.  Higher up, it flows through a mountainous country, and at  Samba, its furthest navigable point, there is a wonderfully  beautiful waterfall, the whole river coming down over a low cliff,  surrounded by an amphitheatre of mountains.  It takes the Eclaireur  two days steaming from the mouth of the Ngunie to Samba, when she  can get up; but now, in the height of the long dry season neither  she nor the Move can go because of the sandbanks; so Samba is cut  off until next October.  Hatton and Cookson have factories up at  Samba, for it is an outlet for the trade of Achango land in rubber  and ivory, a trade worked by the Akele tribe, a powerful, savage and  difficult lot to deal with, and just in the same condition, as far  as I can learn, as they were when Du Chaillu made his wonderful  journeys among them.  While I was at Lembarene, waiting for the  Eclaireur, a notorious chief descended on a Ngunie sub-factory, and  looted it.  The wife of the black trading agent made a gallant  resistance, her husband was away on a trading expedition, but the  chief had her seized and beaten, and thrown into the river.  An  appeal was made to the Doctor then Administrator of the Ogowe, a  powerful and helpful official, and he soon came up with the little  canoniere, taking Mr. Cockshut with him and fully vindicated the  honour of the French flag, under which all factories here are.    The banks of the Ogowe just above Lembarene Island are low; with the  forest only broken by village clearings and seeming to press in on  those, ready to absorb them should the inhabitants cease their war  against it.  The blue Ntyankala mountains of Achango land show away  to the E.S.E. in a range.  Behind us, gradually sinking in the  distance, is the high land on Lembarene Island.    Soon we run up alongside a big street of a village with four high  houses rising a story above the rest, which are strictly ground  floor; it has also five or six little low open thatched huts along  the street in front. {96}  These may be fetish huts, or, as the  captain of the Sparrow would say, \"again they mayn't.\"  For I have  seen similar huts in"]]]
