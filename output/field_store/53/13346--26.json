[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#19)"],[1,"1727, a maker of tapestry engaged Hogarth to sketch him a design  end he set to work ambitiously He worked throughout that year upon the  design, but when he took it to the man it was refused. The truth was  that the man who had commissioned the work had heard that Hogarth was  \"an engraver and no painter,\" and he had so little intelligence that  he did not intend to accept his design, however much it might have  pleased him. Hogarth sued the man for his refusal and he won the  suit. He next began to make what he called \"conversation pieces,\"  little paintings about a foot high of groups of people, the figures  being all portraits. These were very fashionable for a time and made  some money for the artist. Both he and Watteau were fond of the stage,  and both painted scenes from operas and plays.    In time he moved into lodgings at the \"Golden Head,\" in Leicester  Fields, and there he made his home. He had already begun the great  paintings which were to make him famous among artists. These were a  series of pictures, telling stories of fashionable and other life. His  own story of how he came to think of the picture series was that he  had always wished to present dramatic stories--present them in scenes  as he saw them on the stage.    He had married the daughter of Sir James Thornhill, and had never been  thought of kindly by his father-in-law till he made so much stir with  his first series. Then Sir James approved of him, and Hogarth found  life more pleasing.    There are very few anecdotes to tell of the artist's life, and the  story of his pictures is much more amusing. One of his first satires  was made into a pantomime by Theophilus Gibber, and another person  made it into an opera. Many pamphlets and poems were written about it,  and finally china was painted with its scenes and figures. There was  as much to cry as to laugh over in Hogarth's pieces and that is what  made them so truly great. One of his great picture series was called  the \"Rake's Progress\" and it was a warning to all young men against  leading too gay a life. It showed the \"Rake\" at the beginning of his  misfortunes, gambling, and in the last reaping the reward of his  follies in a debtor's prison and the madhouse. There are eight  pictures in that set.    In this series, especially in the fifth picture, there are  extraordinary proofs of Hogarth's completeness of ideas. Upon the wall  in the room wherein the \"Rake\" marries an old woman for her money, the  Ten Commandments are hung, all cracked, and the Creed also is cracked  and nearly smudged out; while the poor-box is covered with  cobwebs. The eight pictures brought to Hogarth only seventy guineas.    One of his pictures was suggested to him by an incident which greatly  angered him. He had started for France on some errand of his own, and  was in the very act of sketching the old gate at Calais, when he was  arrested as a spy. Now Hogarth was a hard-headed Englishman, and when  he was hustled back to England without being given time for argument,  he was so enraged that he made his picture as grotesque as possible,  to the lasting chagrin of France. He painted the French soldiers as  the most absurd, thin little fellows imaginable, and that picture has  largely influenced people's idea of the French soldier all over the  English-speaking world.    As Hogarth grew old he grew also a little bitter and revengeful toward  his enemies, often taking his revenge in the ordinary way of  belittling the people he disliked, in his paintings.    Hogarth came before Reynolds or Gainsborough; in short, was the first  great English artist, and his chief power lay in being able instantly  to catch a fleeting expression, and to interpret it. An incident of  Hogarth's youth illustrates this. He had got into a row in a pot-house  with one of the hangers-on, and when someone struck the brawler over  the head with a pewter pot, there, in the midst of excitement and  rioting, Hogarth whipped out his pencil and hastily sketched the  expression of the chap who had been hit.    Hogarth was friends with most of the theatre managers, and one of his  souvenirs was a gold pass given him by Tyers, the director of Vauxhall  Gardens, which entitled Hogarth and his family to entrance during  their lives. This was in return for some \"passes,\" which Hogarth had  engraved for Tyer.    Upon one occasion Hogarth set off with some companions for a trip to  the Isle of Sheppey. Incidentally Forest wrote a sketch of their  journey and Hogarth illustrated it. That work is to be found,  carefully preserved, in the British Museum. The repeated copying and  reproduction for sale of his pictures brought about the first effort  to protect his works of art by copyright. But it was not till he had  done the \"Rake's Progress\" that he was able to protect himself at all,  and even then not completely.    Just before his death he was staying at Chiswick, but the day before  he died he was removed to his house in Leicester Fields. He was buried  in the Chiswick churchyard; and in that suburb of London may still be  seen his old house and a mulberry tree where he often sat amusing  children for whom he cared very much. Garrick wrote the following  epitaph for his tomb:      If Genius fire thee, Reader, stay;    If Nature touch thee, drop a tear;    If neither move thee, turn away,    For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here.      Farewell, great Painter of Mankind!    Who reached the noblest point of art,    Whose pictured Morals charm the Mind    And through the Eye correct the Heart.      PLATE--THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT    The picture used in illustration here is part of probably the very  greatest art-sermon ever painted, called \"Marriage a la Mode.\" The  story of it is worth telling:    \"The first act is laid in the drawing-room of the Viscount  Squanderfield\"--is not that a fine name for the character? \"On the  left, his lordship is seated, pointing with complacent pride to his  family tree, which has its roots in William the Conqueror. But his  rent roll had been squandered, the gouty foot suggesting whither some  of it has gone; and to restore his fortunes he is about to marry his  heir to the daughter of a rich alderman. The latter is seated  awkwardly at the table, holding the marriage contract duly sealed,  signed and delivered; the price paid for it, being shown by the pile  of money on the table and the bunch of cancelled mortgages which the  lawyer is presenting to the nobleman, who refuses to soil his elegant  fingers with them. Over on the left is his weakling son, helping  himself at this critical turn of his affairs, to a pinch of snuff  while he gazes admiringly at his own figure in the mirror. The lady is  equally indifferent; she has strung the ring on to her finger and is  toying with it, while she listens to the compliments being paid to her  by Counsellor Silver-tongue. Through an open window another lawyer is  comparing his lordship's new house, that is in the course of building,  with the plan in his hand. A marriage so begun could only end in  misery.\" This is the first act, and the pictures that follow show all  the steps of unhappiness which the couple take. There are five more  acts to that painted drama, which is in the National Gallery, London.          XXII    HANS HOLBEIN, THE YOUNGER        (Pronounced Hahntz Hol'bine)    _German School_    1497-1543    _Pupil of Holbein, the Elder_    There were three generations of painters in the Holbein family, and  the Hans of whom we speak was of the third. His grandfather was called  \"old Holbein,\" and when more painters of the same name and family came  along it became necessary to distinguish them from each other thus:  \"old Holbein,\" the \"elder Holbein,\" and \"young Holbein.\" The first one  was not much of an artist; still, in a locality where at best there  was not much art he was good enough to be remembered.    \"Young Holbein\" was born in Augsburg, which is in Swabia, in southern  Germany; \"elder Holbein\" and his father, Michael, \"old Holbein,\" had  moved there from Schonenfeld, a neighbouring village, about forty  three years before little Hans was born, the old Michael bringing his  family to the larger town where it was easier to make a living.    The \"elder Holbein\" was a really good artist and well thought of in  Augsburg, and when little Hans's turn came he had no teacher but his  father, unless indeed we were to call him also a pupil of his elder  brother, Ambrosius. His uncle Sigismund, too, taught him something of  art, for the whole Holbein family seem to have been artists. Young  Holbein was never regularly apprenticed to any outsider.    Art was not then taught as it is now. The work of a beginner was often  to paint for his master certain details which it was thought that he  might handle properly, while the master occupied himself with what he  thought to be some more important part of the picture. It is said that  Hans often painted the draperies of his father's figures when his  father was engaged upon the altar pieces so fashionable at the  time. The Holbeins one and all must have been bad managers or  improvident; at any rate, Hans did not turn out well as a man and we  read that his father was always in debt and difficulty although he  received much money for his work and was not handicapped, like Duerer's  father, by a family of eighteen children.    The story of the Holbeins is quite unlike that of the Duerers, and not  nearly so attractive.    Some time before Hans was twenty years of age, the entire family had  packed up and gone to live in Lucerne, while Hans and his brother,  Ambrosius, went travelling together, as most young Germans went at  that time before they settled down to the serious work of life. The  last we hear of Ambrosius he had joined the painters' guild in Basel,  and probably he died not long afterward, or at any rate while he was  still young. There was in Basel a certain Hans Bar, for whose wedding  occasion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#19)"],[1,"been poured on its  Canadian members. It is not for me to eulogize them, but to portray them  as they were.          CHAPTER III.  1632, 1633.    PAUL LE JEUNE.    Le Jeune's Voyage â¢ His First Pupils â¢ His Studies â¢ His Indian Teacher  â¢ Winter at the Mission-House â¢ Le Jeune's School â¢ Reinforcements    In another narrative, we have seen how the Jesuits, supplanting the  RÃ©collet friars, their predecessors, had adopted as their own the rugged  task of Christianizing New France. We have seen, too, how a descent of  the English, or rather of Huguenots fighting under English colors, had  overthrown for a time the miserable little colony, with the mission to  which it was wedded; and how Quebec was at length restored to France,  and the broken thread of the Jesuit enterprise resumed. [1]    [1] \"Pioneers of France.\"    It was then that Le Jeune had embarked for the New World. He was in his  convent at Dieppe when he received the order to depart; and he set forth  in haste for Havre, filled, he assures us, with inexpressible joy at the  prospect of a living or a dying martyrdom. At Rouen he was joined by De  NouÃ«, with a lay brother named Gilbert; and the three sailed together on  the eighteenth of April, 1632. The sea treated them roughly; Le Jeune  was wretchedly sea-sick; and the ship nearly foundered in a gale. At  length they came in sight of \"that miserable country,\" as the missionary  calls the scene of his future labors. It was in the harbor of Tadoussac  that he first encountered the objects of his apostolic cares; for, as he  sat in the ship's cabin with the master, it was suddenly invaded by ten  or twelve Indians, whom he compares to a party of maskers at the  Carnival. Some had their cheeks painted black, their noses blue, and the  rest of their faces red. Others were decorated with a broad band of  black across the eyes; and others, again, with diverging rays of black,  red, and blue on both cheeks. Their attire was no less uncouth. Some of  them wore shaggy bear-skins, reminding the priest of the pictures of St.  John the Baptist.    After a vain attempt to save a number of Iroquois prisoners whom they  were preparing to burn alive on shore, Le Jeune and his companions again  set sail, and reached Quebec on the fifth of July. Having said mass, as  already mentioned, under the roof of Madame HÃ©bert and her delighted  family, the Jesuits made their way to the two hovels built by their  predecessors on the St. Charles, which had suffered woful dilapidation  at the hands of the English. Here they made their abode, and applied  themselves, with such skill as they could command, to repair the  shattered tenements and cultivate the waste meadows around.    The beginning of Le Jeune's missionary labors was neither imposing nor  promising. He describes himself seated with a small Indian boy on one  side and a small negro on the other, the latter of whom had been left by  the English as a gift to Madame HÃ©bert. As neither of the three  understood the language of the others, the pupils made little progress  in spiritual knowledge. The missionaries, it was clear, must learn  Algonquin at any cost; and, to this end, Le Jeune resolved to visit the  Indian encampments. Hearing that a band of Montagnais were fishing for  eels on the St. Lawrence, between Cape Diamond and the cove which now  bears the name of Wolfe, he set forth for the spot on a morning in  October. As, with toil and trepidation, he scrambled around the foot of  the cape,--whose precipices, with a chaos of loose rocks, thrust  themselves at that day into the deep tidewater,--he dragged down upon  himself the trunk of a fallen tree, which, in its descent, well nigh  swept him into the river. The peril past, he presently reached his  destination. Here, among the lodges of bark, were stretched innumerable  strings of hide, from which hung to dry an incredible multitude of eels.  A boy invited him into the lodge of a withered squaw, his grandmother,  who hastened to offer him four smoked eels on a piece of birch bark,  while other squaws of the household instructed him how to roast them on  a forked stick over the embers. All shared the feast together, his  entertainers using as napkins their own hair or that of their dogs;  while Le Jeune, intent on increasing his knowledge of Algonquin,  maintained an active discourse of broken words and pantomime. [2]    [2] Le Jeune, Relation, 1633, 2.    The lesson, however, was too laborious, and of too little profit, to be  often repeated, and the missionary sought anxiously for more stable  instruction. To find such was not easy. The interpreters--Frenchmen,  who, in the interest of the fur company, had spent years among the  Indians--were averse to Jesuits, and refused their aid. There was one  resource, however, of which Le Jeune would fain avail himself. An  Indian, called Pierre by the French, had been carried to France by the  RÃ©collet friars, instructed, converted, and baptized. He had lately  returned to Canada, where, to the scandal of the Jesuits, he had  relapsed into his old ways, retaining of his French education little  besides a few new vices. He still haunted the fort at Quebec, lured by  the hope of an occasional gift of wine or tobacco, but shunned the  Jesuits, of whose rigid way of life he stood in horror. As he spoke good  French and good Indian, he would have been invaluable to the embarrassed  priests at the mission. Le Jeune invoked the aid of the Saints. The  effect of his prayers soon appeared, he tells us, in a direct  interposition of Providence, which so disposed the heart of Pierre that  he quarrelled with the French commandant, who thereupon closed the fort  against him. He then repaired to his friends and relatives in the woods,  but only to encounter a rebuff from a young squaw to whom he made his  addresses. On this, he turned his steps towards the mission-house, and,  being unfitted by his French education for supporting himself by  hunting, begged food and shelter from the priests. Le Jeune gratefully  accepted him as a gift vouchsafed by Heaven to his prayers, persuaded a  lackey at the fort to give him a cast-off suit of clothes, promised him  maintenance, and installed him as his teacher.    Seated on wooden stools by the rough table in the refectory, the priest  and the Indian pursued their studies. \"How thankful I am,\" writes Le  Jeune, \"to those who gave me tobacco last year! At every difficulty I  give my master a piece of it, to make him more attentive.\" [3]    [3] Relation, 1633, 7. He continues: \"Ie ne sÃ§aurois assez rendre graces  Ã  Nostre Seigneur de cet heureux rencontre.... Que Dieu soit beny pour  vn iamais, sa prouidence est adorable, et sa bontÃ© n'a point de limites\"    Meanwhile, winter closed in with a severity rare even in Canada. The St.  Lawrence and the St. Charles were hard frozen; rivers, forests, and  rocks were mantled alike in dazzling sheets of snow. The humble  mission-house of Notre-Dame des Anges was half buried in the drifts,  which, heaped up in front where a path had been dug through them, rose  two feet above the low eaves. The priests, sitting at night before the  blazing logs of their wide-throated chimney, heard the trees in the  neighboring forest cracking with frost, with a sound like the report of  a pistol. Le Jeune's ink froze, and his fingers were benumbed, as he  toiled at his declensions and conjugations, or translated the Pater  Noster into blundering Algonquin. The water in the cask beside the fire  froze nightly, and the ice was broken every morning with hatchets. The  blankets of the two priests were fringed with the icicles of their  congealed breath, and the frost lay in a thick coating on the  lozenge-shaped glass of their cells. [4]    [4] Le Jeune, Relation, 1633, 14, 15.    By day, Le Jeune and his companion practised with snow-shoes, with all  the mishaps which attend beginners,--the trippings, the falls, and  headlong dives into the soft drifts, amid the laughter of the Indians.  Their seclusion was by no means a solitude. Bands of Montagnais, with  their sledges and dogs, often passed the mission-house on their way to  hunt the moose. They once invited De NouÃ« to go with them; and he,  scarcely less eager than Le Jeune to learn their language, readily  consented. In two or three weeks he appeared, sick, famished, and half  dead with exhaustion. \"Not ten priests in a hundred,\" writes Le Jeune to  his Superior, \"could bear this winter life with the savages.\" But what  of that? It was not for them to falter. They were but instruments in the  hands of God, to be used, broken, and thrown aside, if such should be  His will. [5]    [5] \"Voila, mon Reuerend Pere, vn eschantillon de ce qu'il faut souffrir  courant apres les Sauuages.... Il faut prendre sa vie, et tout ce qu'on  a, et le ietter Ã  l'abandon, pour ainsi dire, se contentant d'vne croix  bien grosse et bien pesante pour toute richesse. Il est bien vray que  Dieu ne se laisse point vaincre, et que plus on quitte, plus on trouue:  plus on perd, plus on gaigne: mais Dieu se cache par fois, et alors le  Calice est bien amer.\"--Le Jeune, Relation 1633, 19.    An Indian made Le Jeune a present of two small children, greatly to the  delight of the missionary, who at once set himself to teaching them to  pray in Latin. As the season grew milder, the number of his scholars  increased; for, when parties of Indians encamped in the neighborhood, he  would take his stand at the door, and, like Xavier at Goa, ring a bell.  At this, a score of children would gather around him; and he, leading  them into the refectory, which served as his school-room, taught them to  repeat after him the Pater, Ave, and Credo, expounded the mystery of the  Trinity, showed them the sign of the cross, and made them repeat an  Indian prayer, the joint composition of Pierre and himself; then  followed the catechism, the lesson closing with singing the Pater  Noster,"]]]
