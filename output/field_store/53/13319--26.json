Children, wherever it is possible, should be given opportunities  for earning money, which they can feel is \"really and truly\" their  own.    They should not be made to feel that the money is not actually  theirs, to do with as they please, but they should be taught self-  denial, and that they must not get rid of their earnings by the  purchase of things not needed.    On the farm, children unconsciously learn much through occasional  work and constant observation, but away from the farm, boys and  girls are apt to know little or nothing of the work in which the  father, the bread winner, is engaged.    Where it is possible, the children should be made familiar by  actual contact with the father's work.    This knowledge may never be used, still it will have value as a  factor in the child's training, for in our modern life all  business is inter-related.    Let the youngsters know something about banks by entrusting them  there when old enough.    Teach them to keep accounts of their own little money affairs,  their earnings, their expenditures, and their balances.    If they should borrow, even a cent, see that they return it at the  time agreed on. Impress on them the fact that debt is a burden  which it is well to get rid of as soon as possible, if one would  stand erect and be entirely free.    All this can be quietly inculcated into the mind of the child  without making him old-fashioned or miserly. The more he knows of  the world the more he can enjoy it in a wholesome way.          CHAPTER XXV    WORTH KNOWING        If things are said in this chapter that seem like a repetition of  things already told, it is that their importance warrants a  repetition in another form.    OVER-GENEROSITY    \"There are no pockets in a shroud,\" it is said. True it is that we  cannot take material things with us to the other side of the  grave, and so before the end comes it is well to make preparations  for their disposition.    There are three ways of getting possession of property:    1. To have it given.  2. To earn it.  3. To steal it.    We shall not consider the last method; that is the business of the  law, but let us look at the first.    Property is given in two ways:    1. By direct gift from one to another.  2. By will, when the amount is payable on the death of the donor.    Of course, the widow and children, if there be any, are first to  be considered in either of the cases named.    Many people, when the end is nearing, think that it is better to  make sure that their wealth will reach the right hands by giving  it direct and at once.    Now, no matter the nobility of the motive that prompts such an  act, it is one which, on the whole, cannot be commended.    It is all very well to spend available means in order to set a son  or daughter up in business, but such sums, if there are other  heirs, should be charged against the share of the probable donee,  with interest, and a record made of the same.    Under no circumstances should old people, who, after raising a  family and living honorable lives, have saved enough to own their  home and secure an income for their declining years, deed or give  this property to their children, or to any one else, in  consideration of their having all their subsequent wants met.    The better way for the farmer, the merchant, or the manufacturer,  when he feels the years pressing heavily and that he can no longer  attend properly to the old demands on him, is to shift by a  properly drawn contract the business management of the enterprise  to his children, or to those whom he wishes to place in charge.    In this way the ownership is not changed, and if the new  management should prove to be inefficient, it can be placed in  more efficient hands.    CARE OF WILLS    As has been said, every person having property of any kind to  dispose of should make a will.    Already ways have been given as to how wills should be made and  estates administered, but to these it may be well to add another  point.    Do not imagine that the making of a will shortens life.    Too often, after the demise of a testator who it is known has made  a will, the heirs cannot find the document, and the lawyer who  drew it knows nothing more about it.    Many men leave their wills with their lawyers. If this should not  be done, then it would be well to keep it in the safe of the bank  in which the testator has his account.    But whether in these places or another, there should be no doubt  as to the existence of a will, or the place in which it may be  found.    Only the last will should be kept; all preceding wills should be  destroyed.    CARE OF PAPERS    While writing about the care of wills, we are struck with the  recollection that wills are not the only papers of value that are  apt to be mislaid or lost.    Never pay out money without taking a receipt, and never receive  money without giving one.    You are not responsible for the care of the receipts you give, but  you certainly are for the receipts you receive.    The trained business man has a place for everything, but there is  no reason why the man not so well trained should have to turn his  shop or his home upside down every time he wants a paper that  proves he has paid a bill, which he must pay again if that receipt  is lost.    Everything may be regarded as \"lost\" that cannot be found, even if  you are sure \"it is about somewhere.\"    No valuable paper should be \"about.\" The only place for it is just  where you can lay your hand on it when wanted.    In addition to keeping your papers where they can be found the  instant they are wanted, see to it that every paper is self-  explanatory and clear of meaning on the face of it.    CHECKS AND STUBS    It has been advised that the stub be always filled out before the  check, and that the check be then copied from the stub. This  course will greatly lessen the chances of disagreement between the  two.    When the last check in the book has been filled and torn out, do  not throw away the stubs. They contain important data and may be  of use in proving payment should a question arise.    In like manner, never destroy the cancelled checks handed you by  the cashier when your bank account has been balanced. Each of  these checks, if drawn to order as it should be, is a receipt, a  voucher, for some payment that may possibly be demanded again.    Be on the safe side.    SENDING AWAY MONEY    It may be well to repeat again, in more condensed form, just how  money may be safely sent to a distance.    1. By bank draft, payable to your order and endorsed over to the  person whom you wish to pay. The party receiving the draft must  endorse it before he can collect, and this endorsement is a  receipt for the money, as the cancelled draft must eventually come  into your possession.  2. You can buy an express order up to fifty dollars, but you may  send money in a package to any amount. Only banks or large dealers  in money do this. Like the bank draft, the express order must be  endorsed by the receiver, and the express company returns it to  you, when it becomes a receipt.  3. By post office orders, up to one hundred dollars.  4. By postal notes, in small amounts.  5. By telegraph.  6. By transmitting a personal check.  7. By a trusted messenger authorized to get a receipt.    The bank draft is the very best way of transmitting money.    As has been said, drafts can be bought at any bank, and they  should always be made payable to your order.    You want to pay a bill of goods to Lloyd, Smith and Company, New  York, so you sign on the back of your draft for the amount:          Pay to the order of    Lloyd, Smith and Company,        Henry C. Robbins.    Lloyd, Smith and Company must endorse the draft before it can be  cashed. The draft, after payment, is returned to you, and it  becomes the best form of receipt.    LOST IN MAILS    Were you ever at the Dead Letter Office in Washington? If you have  never paid such a visit, you can form no conception of the tons,  the hundreds of thousands of letters and parcels that are lost  every year in the mails.    Unaccounted for drafts, checks, postal orders, books, jewelry,  medicine, everything, indeed, that the mails will agree to carry,  may be found piled in that cemetery of lost communications, the  Dead Letter Office.    Have you added to the mortuary list?    All these deaths, like many of living creatures, are due to  carelessness.    As a rule, the sender is to blame. He has misdirected. He has  placed papers not properly folded in the envelope and then  neglected to seal it. He has neglected to write any address at  all, and dropped the letter into the box. Again he has addressed  the parcel, but neither men nor angels can decipher the writing.    MORE ABOUT NOTES    The note, as has been said, is one of the most usual forms of  obligation, yet misunderstandings often arise as to its  settlement.    Here are the points that must be attended to, nor shall we offer  any excuse for repeating them collectively:    1. The date and amount must be so plainly written as to leave no  doubt as to either.  2. The rate of interest, if any, must be clearly expressed.  3. The post office address of the signer or signees must be  written opposite the name.  4. The note should be made payable at a definite place and on a  definite date.  5. In taking a note or other obligation from a person who cannot  write, be sure to have his \"x\" mark witnessed.    Should you receipt certificates of stock as security for the  payment of a note, or the payment of any other debt, be sure to  notify the company issuing them.    In giving this notice, which should be done at once, state clearly  the number of shares you hold, the number of the certificates and  to whom issued.

The fight that followed was a long one and  delayed the resumption of the march for an hour.  The entire community  surrounded us, leaving a clear space about one hundred feet in diameter  for our battle.    Zad first attempted to rush me down as a bull might a wolf, but I was  much too quick for him, and each time I side-stepped his rushes he  would go lunging past me, only to receive a nick from my sword upon his  arm or back.  He was soon streaming blood from a half dozen minor  wounds, but I could not obtain an opening to deliver an effective  thrust.  Then he changed his tactics, and fighting warily and with  extreme dexterity, he tried to do by science what he was unable to do  by brute strength.  I must admit that he was a magnificent swordsman,  and had it not been for my greater endurance and the remarkable agility  the lesser gravitation of Mars lent me I might not have been able to  put up the creditable fight I did against him.    We circled for some time without doing much damage on either side; the  long, straight, needle-like swords flashing in the sunlight, and  ringing out upon the stillness as they crashed together with each  effective parry.  Finally Zad, realizing that he was tiring more than  I, evidently decided to close in and end the battle in a final blaze of  glory for himself; just as he rushed me a blinding flash of light  struck full in my eyes, so that I could not see his approach and could  only leap blindly to one side in an effort to escape the mighty blade  that it seemed I could already feel in my vitals.  I was only partially  successful, as a sharp pain in my left shoulder attested, but in the  sweep of my glance as I sought to again locate my adversary, a sight  met my astonished gaze which paid me well for the wound the temporary  blindness had caused me.  There, upon Dejah Thoris' chariot stood three  figures, for the purpose evidently of witnessing the encounter above  the heads of the intervening Tharks.  There were Dejah Thoris, Sola,  and Sarkoja, and as my fleeting glance swept over them a little tableau  was presented which will stand graven in my memory to the day of my  death.    As I looked, Dejah Thoris turned upon Sarkoja with the fury of a young  tigress and struck something from her upraised hand; something which  flashed in the sunlight as it spun to the ground.  Then I knew what had  blinded me at that crucial moment of the fight, and how Sarkoja had  found a way to kill me without herself delivering the final thrust.  Another thing I saw, too, which almost lost my life for me then and  there, for it took my mind for the fraction of an instant entirely from  my antagonist; for, as Dejah Thoris struck the tiny mirror from her  hand, Sarkoja, her face livid with hatred and baffled rage, whipped out  her dagger and aimed a terrific blow at Dejah Thoris; and then Sola,  our dear and faithful Sola, sprang between them; the last I saw was the  great knife descending upon her shielding breast.    My enemy had recovered from his thrust and was making it extremely  interesting for me, so I reluctantly gave my attention to the work in  hand, but my mind was not upon the battle.    We rushed each other furiously time after time, 'til suddenly, feeling  the sharp point of his sword at my breast in a thrust I could neither  parry nor escape, I threw myself upon him with outstretched sword and  with all the weight of my body, determined that I would not die alone  if I could prevent it.  I felt the steel tear into my chest, all went  black before me, my head whirled in dizziness, and I felt my knees  giving beneath me.          CHAPTER XV    SOLA TELLS ME HER STORY      When consciousness returned, and, as I soon learned, I was down but a  moment, I sprang quickly to my feet searching for my sword, and there I  found it, buried to the hilt in the green breast of Zad, who lay stone  dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom.  As I regained my  full senses I found his weapon piercing my left breast, but only  through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs, entering near the  center of my chest and coming out below the shoulder.  As I had lunged  I had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles,  inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.    Removing the blade from my body I also regained my own, and turning my  back upon his ugly carcass, I moved, sick, sore, and disgusted, toward  the chariots which bore my retinue and my belongings.  A murmur of  Martian applause greeted me, but I cared not for it.    Bleeding and weak I reached my women, who, accustomed to such  happenings, dressed my wounds, applying the wonderful healing and  remedial agents which make only the most instantaneous of death blows  fatal.  Give a Martian woman a chance and death must take a back seat.  They soon had me patched up so that, except for weakness from loss of  blood and a little soreness around the wound, I suffered no great  distress from this thrust which, under earthly treatment, undoubtedly  would have put me flat on my back for days.    As soon as they were through with me I hastened to the chariot of Dejah  Thoris, where I found my poor Sola with her chest swathed in bandages,  but apparently little the worse for her encounter with Sarkoja, whose  dagger it seemed had struck the edge of one of Sola's metal breast  ornaments and, thus deflected, had inflicted but a slight flesh wound.    As I approached I found Dejah Thoris lying prone upon her silks and  furs, her lithe form wracked with sobs.  She did not notice my  presence, nor did she hear me speaking with Sola, who was standing a  short distance from the vehicle.    \"Is she injured?\" I asked of Sola, indicating Dejah Thoris by an  inclination of my head.    \"No,\" she answered, \"she thinks that you are dead.\"    \"And that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish its  teeth?\" I queried, smiling.    \"I think you wrong her, John Carter,\" said Sola.  \"I do not understand  either her ways or yours, but I am sure the granddaughter of ten  thousand jeddaks would never grieve like this over any who held but the  highest claim upon her affections.  They are a proud race, but they are  just, as are all Barsoomians, and you must have hurt or wronged her  grievously that she will not admit your existence living, though she  mourns you dead.    \"Tears are a strange sight upon Barsoom,\" she continued, \"and so it is  difficult for me to interpret them.  I have seen but two people weep in  all my life, other than Dejah Thoris; one wept from sorrow, the other  from baffled rage.  The first was my mother, years ago before they  killed her; the other was Sarkoja, when they dragged her from me today.\"    \"Your mother!\" I exclaimed, \"but, Sola, you could not have known your  mother, child.\"    \"But I did.  And my father also,\" she added.  \"If you would like to  hear the strange and un-Barsoomian story come to the chariot tonight,  John Carter, and I will tell you that of which I have never spoken in  all my life before.  And now the signal has been given to resume the  march, you must go.\"    \"I will come tonight, Sola,\" I promised.  \"Be sure to tell Dejah Thoris  I am alive and well.  I shall not force myself upon her, and be sure  that you do not let her know I saw her tears.  If she would speak with  me I but await her command.\"    Sola mounted the chariot, which was swinging into its place in line,  and I hastened to my waiting thoat and galloped to my station beside  Tars Tarkas at the rear of the column.    We made a most imposing and awe-inspiring spectacle as we strung out  across the yellow landscape; the two hundred and fifty ornate and  brightly colored chariots, preceded by an advance guard of some two  hundred mounted warriors and chieftains riding five abreast and one  hundred yards apart, and followed by a like number in the same  formation, with a score or more of flankers on either side; the fifty  extra mastodons, or heavy draught animals, known as zitidars, and the  five or six hundred extra thoats of the warriors running loose within  the hollow square formed by the surrounding warriors.  The gleaming  metal and jewels of the gorgeous ornaments of the men and women,  duplicated in the trappings of the zitidars and thoats, and  interspersed with the flashing colors of magnificent silks and furs and  feathers, lent a barbaric splendor to the caravan which would have  turned an East Indian potentate green with envy.    The enormous broad tires of the chariots and the padded feet of the  animals brought forth no sound from the moss-covered sea bottom; and so  we moved in utter silence, like some huge phantasmagoria, except when  the stillness was broken by the guttural growling of a goaded zitidar,  or the squealing of fighting thoats.  The green Martians converse but  little, and then usually in monosyllables, low and like the faint  rumbling of distant thunder.    We traversed a trackless waste of moss which, bending to the pressure  of broad tire or padded foot, rose up again behind us, leaving no sign  that we had passed.  We might indeed have been the wraiths of the  departed dead upon the dead sea of that dying planet for all the sound  or sign we made in passing.  It was the first march of a large body of  men and animals I had ever witnessed which raised no dust and left no  spoor; for there is no dust upon Mars except in the cultivated  districts during the winter months, and even then the absence of high  winds renders it almost unnoticeable.    We camped that night at the foot of the hills we had been approaching  for two days and which marked the southern boundary of this particular  sea.  Our animals had been two days without drink, nor had they had  water for nearly two months, not since shortly after leaving Thark;  but, as Tars Tarkas explained to me, they require but little and can  live almost indefinitely upon the moss which covers"]]]
