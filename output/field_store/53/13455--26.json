[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#2)"],[1,"nce! The minds which one found in the pages of a  book were understandable. But the minds of living men--how terrible  they were! One could never tell what passed behind the bright eyes of  other human beings. They mocked one. When they seemed sad they might  be about to laugh. The minds of the two brothers eluded him, mocked  him, slipped from beneath the slow grasp of his comprehension. They  whipped him with their scorn. They dodged him with their wits. They  bewildered him with their mockery.    But they were nothing compared with the laughter of the girl. It went  through him like the flash and point of Le Balafr√©'s long sword. He  was helpless before that sound of mirth. He wanted to hold up his  hands and cower away from her and from her dancing eyes. So he stood,  ponderous, tortured, and the three pairs of clear eyes watched him and  enjoyed his torture. Better, far better, that dark castle in ancient  France, and the wicked Oliver and the yet more wicked Louis.    \"Lay hold on that stump,\" shouted Harry.    He heard the directions through a haze. It was twice repeated before  he bowed and set his great hands upon the ragged projections, where  the side roots had been cut away. He settled his grip and waited. He  was glad because this bowed position gave him a chance to look down to  the ground and avoid their cruel eyes. How bright those eyes were,  thought Bull, and how clearly they saw all things! He never doubted  the justice behind their judgments of him; all that Bull asked from  the world was a merciful silence--to let him grub in his books now and  then, or else to tell him how to go about some simple work, such as  digging with a pick. Here one's muscles worked, and there was no  problem to disturb wits which were still gathering wool in the pages  of some old tale.    But they were shrilling new directions at him; perhaps they had been  calling to him several times.    \"You blamed idiot, are you goin' to stand there all day? We didn't  give you that stump to rest on. Pull it up!\"    He started with a sense of guilt and tugged up. His fingers slipped  off their separate grips, and the stump, though it groaned against the  taproot under the strain, did not come out.    \"It don't seem to budge, somehow,\" said Bull in his big, soft,  plaintive voice. Then he waited for the laughter. There was always  laughter, no matter what he did or said, but he never grew calloused  against it. It was the one pain which ever pierced the mist of his  brain and cut him to the quick. And he was right. There was laughter  again. He stood suffering mutely under it.    The girl's face became grave. She murmured to Harry, \"Ever try  praisin' to big stupid?\"    \"Him? Are you joshin' me, Jessie? What's he ever done to be praised  about?\"    \"You watch!\" said the girl. Growing excited with her idea, she called,  \"Say, Bull!\"    He lifted his head, but not his eyes. Those eyes studied the impatient  feet of the girl's mustang; he waited for another stroke of wit that  would bring forth a fresh shower of laughter at his expense.    \"Bull, you're mighty big and strong. About the biggest and strongest  man I ever seen!\"    Was this a new and subtle form of mockery? He waited dully.    \"I seen Harry and Joe both try to pull up that root, and they couldn't  so much as budge it. But I bet you could do it all alone, Bull! You  just try! I bet you could!\"    It amazed him. He lifted his eyes at length; his face suffused with a  flush; his big, cloudy eyes were glistening with moisture.    \"D'you mean that?\" he asked huskily.    For this terrible, clear-eyed creature, this mocking mind, this alert,  cruel wit was actually speaking words of confidence. A great, dim joy  welled up in the heart of Bull Hunter. He shook the forelock out  of his eyes.    \"You just try, will you, Bull?\"    \"I'll try!\"    He bowed. Again his thick fingers sought for a grip, found places,  worked down through the soft dirt and the pulpy bark to solid wood,  and then he began to lift. It was a gradual process. His knees gave,  sagging under the strain from the arms. Then the back began to grow  rigid, and the legs in turn grew stiff, as every muscle fell into  play. The shoulders pushed forward and down. The forearms, revealed by  the short sleeves, showed a bewildering tangle of corded muscle, and,  at the wrists, the tendons sprang out as distinct and white as the new  strings of a violin.    The three spectators were undergoing a change. The suppressed grins of  the two brothers faded. They glanced at the girl to see if she were  not laughing at the results of her words to big Bull, but the girl was  staring. She had set that mighty power to work, and she was amazed by  the thing she saw. And they, looking back at Bull, were amazed in  turn. They had seen him lift great logs, wrench boulders from the  earth. But always it had been a proverb within the Campbell family  that Bull would make only one attempt and, failing in the first  effort, would try no more. They had never seen the mysterious  resources of his strength called upon.    Now they watched first the settling and then the expansion of the body  of their big cousin. His shoulders began to tremble; they heard deep,  harsh panting like the breathing of a horse as it tugs a ponderous  load up a hill, and still he had not reached the limit of his power.  He seemed to grow into the soil, and his feet ground deeper into the  soft dirt, and ever there was something in him remaining to be tapped.  It seemed to the brothers to be merely vast, unexplored recesses of  muscle, but even then it was a prodigious thing to watch the strain on  the stump increase moment by moment. That something of the spirit was  being called upon to aid in the work was quite beyond their  comprehension.    There was something like a groan from Bull--a queer, animal sound that  made all three spectators shiver where they stood. For it showed that  the limit of that apparently inexhaustible strength had been reached  and that now the anguish of last effort was going into the work. They  saw the head bowed lower; the shoulders were now bunching and swelling  up on either side.    Then came a faint rending sound, like cloth slowly torn. It was  answered by something strangely like a snarl from the laborer.  Something jerked through his body as though a whip had been flicked  across his back. With a great rending and a loud snap the big stump  came up. A little shower of dirt spouted up with the parting of the  taproot. The trunk was flung high, but not out of the hands of Bull  Hunter. He whirled it around his head, laughing. There was a ring and  clearness in that laughter that they had never heard before. He dashed  the stump on the ground.    \"It's out!\" exclaimed Bull. \"Look there!\"    He strode upon them. As he straightened up he became huger than ever.  They shrank from him--from the veins which still bulged on his  forehead and from the sweat and pallor of that vast effort. The very  mustang winced from this mountain of a man who came with a long,  sweeping, springing stride. On his face was a strange joy as of the  explorer who tops the mountains and sees the beauty of the promised  land beneath him. He held out his hand.    \"Lady, I got to thank you. You--taught me how!\"    But she shrank from his outstretched hand--as though she had labored  to a larger end than she dreamed and was terrified by the thing  she had made.    \"You--you got a red stain on your hands. Oh!\"    He came to a stop sharply. The sharp edges, where the roots had been  cut away had worked through the skin and his hands were literally  caked with mud and stained red. Bull looked down at his hands vaguely.    It came to Harry that Bull was taking up a trifle too much of Jessie's  attention. The next thing they knew she would be inviting him to come  to the next dance down her way, and they would have the big hulk of a  man shaming himself and his uncle's family.    \"Go on back to the house,\" he ordered sharply. \"We don't have no more  need of you.\"    Bull obeyed, stumbling along and still looking down at his wounded  hands.          CHAPTER 2      He left the three behind him, bewildered and frightened. Had lightning  split a thick tree beside them, or an unexpected landslide thundered  past and swept the ground away at their feet, they could have been  hardly more disturbed.    \"Who'd of thought he could act like that!\" remarked Joe. \"My gosh,  Jessie!\"    They went and looked at the hole where the stump had stood. At the  bottom was the white remnant of the taproot where it had burst under  the strain.    \"It wasn't so much how he pulled up the stump,\" said the girl faintly.  \"But--but did you see his face, boys, after he heaved the stump up?  I--just pick that stump up, will you?\"    They went to the misshapen, ragged monster and lifted it, puffing  under the weight.    \"All right.\"    They dropped it obediently.    \"And he--he just swung it around his head like it was nothing!\"  declared the girl. \"Look how it smashed into the gravel where he threw  it down! Why--why--I didn't know men was made like that. And his  face--the way he laughed--why he didn't look like no fool at all,  boys. But just as if he'd waked up!\"    \"You act so interested,\" said Harry Campbell dryly, \"that maybe you'd  like to have us call him out again so's you can talk to him?\"    Apparently she did not hear, but stared down into the mist of the late  afternoon, warning her that she must start home. She seemed puzzled  and a little frightened. When she left them it was with a wave of the  hand and with no words of farewell. They watched her go down the trail  that jerked back and forth across the pitch of the slope; twice her  pony stumbled, a sure sign that the rider was absent-minded.    \"Jessie didn't seem to know what to make of it,\" said Harry.    \"Neither do I,\" returned his brother.    Both of them spoke in subdued voices as if they were afraid of being  overheard."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#2)"],[1,"t, they were not unwilling to sustain the  Turkish Government. While the Constitution imposed on them the burden of  militarism, it had brought with it the compensation of freedom of  religion and equal rights; and we could not forget that for six hundred  years Turkey has held her gates wide open to the Jews who fled from the  Spanish Inquisition and similar ministrations of other civilized  countries.    Of course, we never dreamed that Turkey would do anything but remain  neutral. If we had had any idea of the turn things were ultimately to  take, we should have given a different greeting to the _mouchtar_, or  sheriff, who came to our village with the list of mobilizable men to be  called on for service. My own position was a curious one. I had every  intention of completing the process of becoming an American citizen,  which I had begun by taking out \"first papers.\" In the eyes of the law,  however, I was still a Turkish subject, with no claim to American  protection. This was sneeringly pointed out to me by the American Consul  at Haifa, who happens to be a German; so there was no other course but  to surrender myself to the Turkish Government.          CHAPTER II    PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE      There was no question as to my eligibility for service. I was young and  strong and healthy--and even if I had not been, the physical examination  of Turkish recruits is a farce. The enlisting officers have a theory of  their own that no man is really unfit for the army--a theory which has  been fostered by the ingenious devices of the Arabs to avoid  conscription. To these wild people the protracted discipline of military  training is simply a purgatory, and for weeks before the recruiting  officers are due, they dose themselves with powerful herbs and physics  and fast, and nurse sores into being, until they are in a really  deplorable condition. Some of them go so far as to cut off a finger or  two. The officers, however, have learned to see beyond these little  tricks, and few Arabs succeed in wriggling through their drag-net. I  have watched dozens of Arabs being brought in to the recruiting office  on camels or horses, so weak were they, and welcomed into the service  with a severe beating--the sick and the shammers sharing the same fate.  Thus it often happens that some of the new recruits die after their  first day of garrison life.    Together with twenty of my comrades, I presented myself at the  recruiting station at Acco (the St. Jean d'Acre of history). We had been  given to understand that, once our names were registered, we should be  allowed to return home to provide ourselves with money, suitable  clothing, and food, as well as to bid our families good-bye. To our  astonishment, however, we were marched off to the Han, or caravanserai,  and locked into the great courtyard with hundreds of dirty Arabs. Hour  after hour passed; darkness came, and finally we had to stretch  ourselves on the ground and make the best of a bad situation. It was a  night of horrors. Few of us had closed an eye when, at dawn, an officer  appeared and ordered us out of the Han. From our total number about  three hundred (including four young men from our village and myself)  were picked out and told to make ready to start at once for Saffed, a  town in the hills of northern Galilee near the Sea of Tiberias, where  our garrison was to be located. No attention was paid to our requests  that we be allowed to return to our homes for a final visit. That same  morning we were on our way to Saffed--a motley, disgruntled crew.    [ILLUSTRATION: SAFFED]    It was a four days' march--four days of heat and dust and physical  suffering. The September sun smote us mercilessly as we straggled along  the miserable native trail, full of gullies and loose stones. It would  not have been so bad if we had been adequately shod or clothed; but soon  we found ourselves envying the ragged Arabs as they trudged along  barefoot, paying no heed to the jagged flints. (Shoes, to the Arab, are  articles for ceremonious indoor use; when any serious walking is to be  done, he takes them off, slings them over his shoulder, and trusts to  the horny soles of his feet.)    To add to our troubles, the Turkish officers, with characteristic  fatalism, had made no commissary provision for us whatever. Any food we  ate had to be purchased by the roadside from our own funds, which were  scant enough to start with. The Arabs were in a terrible plight. Most of  them were penniless, and, as the pangs of hunger set in, they began  pillaging right and left from the little farms by the wayside. From  modest beginnings--poultry and vegetables--they progressed to larger  game, unhindered by the officers. Houses were entered, women insulted;  time and again I saw a stray horse, grazing by the roadside, seized by a  crowd of grinning Arabs, who piled on the poor beast's back until he was  almost crushed to earth, and rode off triumphantly, while their comrades  held back the weeping owner. The result of this sort of  \"requisitioning,\" was that our band of recruits was followed by an  increasing throng of farmers--imploring, threatening, trying by hook or  by crook to win back the stolen goods. Little satisfaction did they get,  although some of them went with us as far as Saffed.    Our garrison town is not an inviting place, nor has it an inviting  reputation. Lord Kitchener himself had good reason to remember it. As a  young lieutenant of twenty-three, in the Royal Engineering Corps, he was  nearly killed there by a band of fanatical Arabs while surveying for the  Palestine Exploration Fund. Kitchener had a narrow escape of it (one of  his fellow officers was shot dead close by him), but he went calmly  ahead and completed his maps, splendid large-scale affairs which have  never since been equaled--and which are now in use by the Turkish and  German armies! However, though Saffed combines most of the unpleasant  characteristics of Palestine native towns, we welcomed the sight of it,  for we were used up by the march. An old deserted mosque was given us  for barracks; there, on the bare stone floor, in close-packed  promiscuity, too tired to react to filth and vermin, we spent our first  night as soldiers of the Sultan, while the milky moonlight streamed in  through every chink and aperture, and bats flitted round the vaulting  above the snoring carcasses of the recruits.    Next morning we were routed out at five. The black depths of the well in  the center of the mosque courtyard provided doubtful water for washing,  bathing, and drinking; then came breakfast,--our first government  meal,--consisting, simply enough, of boiled rice, which was ladled out  into tin wash-basins holding rations for ten men. In true Eastern  fashion we squatted down round the basin and dug into the rice with our  fingers. At first I was rather upset by this sort of table manners, and  for some time I ate with my eyes fixed on my own portion, to avoid  seeing the Arabs, who fill the palms of their hands with rice, pat it  into a ball and cram it into their mouths just so, the bolus making a  great lump in their lean throats as it reluctantly descends.    In the course of that same morning we were allotted our uniforms. The  Turkish uniform, under indirect German influence, has been greatly  modified during the past five years. It is of khaki--a greener khaki  than that of the British army, and of conventional European cut. Spiral  puttees and good boots are provided; the only peculiar feature is the  headgear--a curious, uncouth-looking combination of the turban and the  German helmet, devised by Enver Pasha to combine religion and  practicality, and called in his honor _enverieh_. (With commendable  thrift, Enver patented his invention, and it is rumored that he has  drawn a comfortable fortune from its sale.) An excellent uniform it is,  on the whole; but, to our disgust, we found that in the great olive-drab  pile to which we were led, there was not a single new one. All were old,  discarded, and dirty, and the mere thought of putting on the clothes of  some unknown Arab legionary, who, perhaps, had died of cholera at Mecca  or Yemen, made me shudder. After some indecision, my friends and I  finally went up to one of the officers and offered to _buy_ new uniforms  with the money we expected daily from our families. The officer,  scenting the chance for a little private profit, gave his consent.    The days and weeks following were busy ones. From morning till night, it  was drill, drill, and again drill. We were divided into groups of fifty,  each of which was put in charge of a young non-commissioned officer from  the Military School of Constantinople or Damascus, or of some Arab who  had seen several years' service. These instructors had a hard time of  it; the German military system, which had only recently been introduced,  was too much for them. They kept mixing up the old and the new methods  of training, with the result that it was often hopeless to try and make  out their orders. Whole weeks were spent in grinding into the Arabs the  names of the different parts of the rifle; weeks more went to teaching  them to clean it--although it must be said that, once they had mastered  these technicalities, they were excellent shots. Their efficiency would  have been considerably greater if there had been more target-shooting.  From the very first, however, we felt that there was a scarcity of  ammunition. This shortage the drill-masters, in a spirit of  compensation, attempted to make up by abundant severity. The whip of  soft, flexible, stinging leather, which seldom leaves the Turkish  officer's hand, was never idle. This was not surprising, for the Arab is  a cunning fellow, whose only respect is for brute force. He exercises it  himself on every possible victim, and expects the same treatment from  his superiors.    So far as my comrades and I were concerned, I must admit that we"]]]
