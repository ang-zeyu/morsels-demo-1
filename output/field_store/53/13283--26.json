Then all of a sudden two  slaves came in, carrying on as if they had been fighting at the fountain,  at least; each one had a water-jar hanging from a yoke around his neck.  Trimalchio arbitrated their difference, but neither would abide by his  decision, and each one smashed the other's jar with a club.  Perturbed at  the insolence of these drunken ruffians, we watched both of them  narrowly, while they were fighting, and then, what should come pouring  out of the broken jars but oysters and scallops, which a slave picked up  and passed around in a dish.  The resourceful cook would not permit  himself to be outdone by such refinements, but served us with snails on a  silver gridiron, and sang continually in a tremulous and very discordant  voice.  I am ashamed to have to relate what followed, for, contrary to  all convention, some long-haired boys brought in unguents in a silver  basin and anointed the feet of the reclining guests; but before doing  this, however, they bound our thighs and ankles with garlands of flowers.  They then perfumed the wine-mixing vessel with the same unguent and  poured some of the melted liquid into the lamps.  Fortunata had, by this  time, taken a notion that she wanted to dance, and Scintilla was doing  more hand-clapping than talking, when Trimalchio called out,  \"Philargyrus, and you too, Carrio, you can both come to the table;  even if you are green faction fans, and tell your bedfellow, Menophila,  to come too.\"  What would you think happened then?  We were nearly  crowded off the couches by the mob of slaves that crowded into the  dining-room and almost filled it full.  As a matter of fact, I noticed  that our friend the cook, who had made a goose out of a hog, was placed  next to me, and he stunk from sauces and pickle.  Not satisfied with a  place at the table, he immediately staged an impersonation of Ephesus the  tragedian, and then he suddenly offered to bet his master that the greens  would take first place in the next circus games.          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FIRST.    Trimalchio was hugely tickled at this challenge.  \"Slaves are men, my  friends,\" he observed, \"but that's not all, they sucked the same milk  that we did, even if hard luck has kept them down; and they'll drink the  water of freedom if I live: to make a long story short, I'm freeing all  of them in my will.  To Philargyrus, I'm leaving a farm, and his  bedfellow, too.  Carrio will get a tenement house and his twentieth,  and a bed and bedclothes to boot.  I'm making Fortunata my heir and I  commend her to all my friends.  I announce all this in public so that my  household will love me as well now as they will when I'm dead.\"  They all  commenced to pay tribute to the generosity of their master, when he,  putting aside his trifling, ordered a copy of his will brought in, which  same he read aloud from beginning to end, to the groaning accompaniment  of the whole household.  Then, looking at Habinnas, \"What say you, my  dearest friend,\" he entreated; \"you'll construct my monument in keeping  with the plans I've given you, won't you?  I earnestly beg that you carve  a little bitch at the feet of my statue, some wreaths and some jars of  perfume, and all of the fights of Petraites.  Then I'll be able to live  even after I'm dead, thanks to your kindness.  See to it that it has a  frontage of one hundred feet and a depth of two hundred.  I want fruit  trees of every kind planted around my ashes; and plenty of vines, too,  for it's all wrong for a man to deck out his house when he's alive, and  then have no pains taken with the one he must stay in for a longer time,  and that's the reason I particularly desire that this notice be added:                           --THIS MONUMENT DOES NOT--                           --DESCEND TO AN HEIR--    \"In any case, I'll see to it through a clause in my will, that I'm not  insulted when I'm dead.  And for fear the rabble comes running up into my  monument, to crap, I'll appoint one of my freedmen custodian of my tomb.  I want you to carve ships under full sail on my monument, and me, in my  robes of office, sitting on my tribunal, five gold rings on my fingers,  pouring out coin from a sack for the people, for I gave a dinner and two  dinars for each guest, as you know.  Show a banquet-hall, too, if you  can, and the people in it having a good time.  On my right, you can place  a statue of Fortunata holding a dove and leading a little bitch on a  leash, and my favorite boy, and large jars sealed with gypsum, so the  wine won't run out; show one broken and a boy crying over it.  Put a  sun-dial in the middle, so that whoever looks to see what time it is must  read my name whether he wants to or not.  As for the inscription, think  this over carefully, and see if you think it's appropriate:                       HERE RESTS G POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO                       FREEDMAN OF MAECENAS DECREED                      AUGUSTAL, SEVIR IN HIS ABSENCE                      HE COULD HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF                      EVERY DECURIA OF ROME BUT WOULD                       NOT CONSCIENTIOUS BRAVE LOYAL                     HE GREW RICH FROM LITTLE AND LEFT                      THIRTY MILLION SESTERCES BEHIND                       HE NEVER HEARD A PHILOSOPHER                            FAREWELL TRIMALCHIO                             FAREWELL PASSERBY\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SECOND.    When he had repeated these words, Trimalchio began to weep copiously,  Fortunata was crying already, and so was Habinnas, and at last, the whole  household filled the dining-room with their lamentations, just as if they  were taking part in a funeral.  Even I was beginning to sniffle, when  Trimalchio said, \"Let's live while we can, since we know we've all got to  die.  I'd rather see you all happy, anyhow, so let's take a plunge in the  bath.  You'll never regret it.  I'll bet my life on that, it's as hot as  a furnace!\"  \"Fine business,\" seconded Habinnas, \"there's nothing suits  me better than making two days out of one,\" and he got up in his bare  feet to follow Trimalchio, who was clapping his hands.  I looked at  Ascyltos.  \"What do you think about this?\" I asked.  \"The very sight of a  bath will be the death of me.\"  \"Let's fall in with his suggestion,\" he  replied, \"and while they are hunting for the bath we will escape in the  crowd.\"  Giton led us out through the porch, when we had reached this  understanding, and we came to a door, where a dog on a chain startled us  so with his barking that Ascyltos immediately fell into the fish-pond.  As for myself, I was tipsy and had been badly frightened by a dog that  was only a painting, and when I tried to haul the swimmer out, I was  dragged into the pool myself.  The porter finally came to our rescue,  quieted the dog by his appearance, and pulled us, shivering, to dry land.  Giton had ransomed himself by a very cunning scheme, for what we had  saved for him, from dinner, he threw to the barking brute, which then  calmed its fury and became engrossed with the food.  But when, with  chattering teeth, we besought the porter to let us out at the door, \"If  you think you can leave by the same door you came in at,\" he replied,  \"you're mistaken: no guest is ever allowed to go out through the same  door he came in at; some are for entrance, others for exit.\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-THIRD.    What were we miserable wretches to do, shut up in this newfangled  labyrinth.  The idea of taking a hot bath had commenced to grow in favor,  so we finally asked the porter to lead us to the place and, throwing off  our clothing, which Giton spread out in the hall to dry, we went in.  It was very small, like a cold water cistern; Trimalchio was standing  upright in it, and one could not escape his disgusting bragging even  here.  He declared that there was nothing nicer than bathing without a  mob around, and that a bakery had formerly occupied this very spot.  Tired out at last, he sat down, but when the echoes of the place tempted  him, he lifted his drunken mouth to the ceiling, and commenced murdering  the songs of Menacrates, at least that is what we were told by those who  understood his language.  Some of the guests joined hands and ran around  the edge of the pool, making the place ring with their boisterous peals  of laughter; others tried to pick rings up from the floor, with their  hands tied behind them, or else, going down upon their knees, tried to  touch the ends of their toes by bending backwards.  We went down into the  pool while the rest were taking part in such amusements.  It was being  heated for Trimalchio.  When the fumes of the wine had been dissipated,  we were conducted into another dining-room where Fortunata had laid out  her own treasures; I noticed, for instance, that there were little bronze  fishermen upon the lamps, the tables were of solid silver, the cups were  porcelain inlaid with gold; before our eyes wine was being strained  through a straining cloth.  \"One of my slaves shaves his first beard  today,\" Trimalchio remarked, at length, \"a promising, honest, thrifty  lad; may he have no bad luck, so let's get our skins full and stick  around till morning.\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FOURTH.    He had not ceased speaking when a cock crowed!  Alarmed at this omen,  Trimalchio ordered wine thrown under the table and told them to sprinkle  the lamps with it; and he even went so far as to change his ring from his  left hand to his right.  \"That trumpeter did not sound off without a  reason,\" he remarked; \"there's either a fire in the neighborhood, or else  someone's going to give up the ghost.  I hope it's none of us!  Whoever  brings that Jonah in shall have a present.\"  He had no sooner made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#19)"],[1,"         she is very much engaged.      HOSTESS. The hostess wears afternoon dress,         and usually one that is dainty and delicate--         suitable for a summer afternoon.           She receives on the lawn, shakes hands         with each guest, and makes introductions         when deemed essential.           She may, if she so desires, receive with         some member of her family.      HOURS. These are from 3 to 7 P.M.      INVITATIONS. These are issued in the name of         the hostess, and may be engraved or written.         Sometimes the hostess writes on her card:         GARDEN PARTY, JULY 17, FROM 4 TO 7, or she         may use an AT HOME card, and in the lower         left-hand corner write: GARDEN PARTY. The         engraved card usually indicates an elaborate         affair.           These invitations may be sent by mail or         messenger.           It is a good plan to add to the invitations         some information regarding the trains, or to         enclose a time-table.           All such invitations should be promptly         acknowledged or declined.      MEN. Men wear summer business suits, white         ducks, or yachting flannels, A tennis suit         would be permissible.           The regulation frock coat and high hat         should be worn only by men from the city         attending an affair in the country, or at some         extremely fashionable affair.           Men should greet the hostess both on their         arrival and departure.           Visiting-cards are left only at large garden         parties.      WOMEN. Women wear light, delicate, afternoon         dresses.           They should greet the hostess, both on their         arrival and departure.           Visiting-cards are left only at large and         formal outdoor affairs.        GERMANS. See COTILLIONS.        GIFTS.      AFTER HOUSE PARTY. While not necessary, a         guest after a house party may send some         trifle to the hostess as a token of pleasure         and appreciation.      BEST MAN. After the groom selects the best         man, the latter should send a gift to the         bride, and may, if he wish, send it to the         groom, a custom not yet clearly established.      CHRISTENING. A christening ceremony offers a         good opportunity for the invited guests so         wishing to send a gift to the baby. These         should be sent a day or two before the         ceremony, and, if of silver, should be suitably         marked with the child's name, initials, or         monogram.      ENGAGEMENT. If both families of the engaged         couple are old acquaintances, the parents of         the man may send a gift along with their         greetings and congratulations.      WEDDING. See WEDDINGS--GIFTS.        GIFTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. Books, flowers,         and other small articles of decoration are         proper gifts to accept.           Sending valuable gifts of jewelry, or any         other article, depends largely upon the         relationships of the parties, and should not be         done unless the sender is sure of its         acceptance. Such gifts should not be accepted         from mere acquaintances or friends.           It is bad form for a man to send expensive         presents to a woman who may be compelled         to return them.        GLOVES.      MEN. At the opera or theatre, if in full dress,         gloves may be dispensed with, but they are         worn with street dress. With formal evening         dress, white kid gloves should be worn.           For afternoon dress, gloves should be of         undressed kid, gray, tan, or brown. When         calling, the glove of the right hand should         be removed upon entering the drawing-room.           Gloves should not be worn at high teas.      MEN--AFTERNOON DRESS. Undressed kid         gloves of a dark color are worn.      MEN-BALLS. Men should always wear gloves         at all balls, in summer or winter, in town or         city.      MEN-CALLING ON WOMEN. Gloves need not         be removed at a formal or brief call.      MEN-DANCES. Gloves should be worn at formal         dances, and should be put on before entering         the room.      MEN-HIGH TEA. Men do not wear gloves.      MEN-MOURNING. Black or dark-colored gloves         should be worn.      MEN--SHAKING HANDS. At weddings, operas,         or dances, and on all very formal occasions,         men wear gloves. In shaking hands with         women on these occasions gloves should not         be removed.           If a hostess wears gloves at any formal         affair, a man wears his when he shakes hands         with her.           A man with hands gloved should never         shake hands with a woman without an apology         for so doing, unless she likewise wears gloves.         A sudden meeting, etc., may make a hand-shaking         in gloves unavoidable. Unless the         other party is also gloved, a man should say:         \"Please excuse my glove.\"      WOMEN. Gloves should always be worn on the         street.           At dinners, or formal teas, women should         remove their gloves at the table and place         them in their laps.           At dinners and formal teas, when the         women have retired to the drawing-room,         they may resume their gloves or not, or         follow the example of the hostess.           At informal teas or \"At Homes\" the         hostess need not wear gloves.      BREAKFAST. Gloves should be removed at table.      DINNER. Women may remove their gloves at         table, and it is not necessary to replace         them. They should be laid in the lap. The         hostess generally determines by her own         actions whether the women should resume         gloves or not.      MOURNING. Gloves may be of black kid, suede,         or black silk. In the evening, black suede         or glace, or white suede should be worn.         White gloves with black stitching should not         be worn in the evening.      BRIDE. See BRIDE--GLOVES.      GROOM. See GROOM--GLOVES.      USHERS. See USHERS--GLOVES.        GODFATHER. A man asked to be one of the sponsors         at a christening ceremony should reply by a         written note or by calling in person.           He should call immediately on the parents         and send flowers to the mother, and express         himself as pleased at the compliment.           He should send a present to the child,         usually a piece of jewelry or some silver, and,         if a wealthy relative, may deposit a sum of         money to the child's credit, and present him         with the bank-book.           He should also send with his present one         of his calling cards, on which is written some         appropriate sentiment.           It is his privilege, when the wine is about         to be drunk after the ceremony, to first         propose the health of the child and then the         health of the mother.           The duties of the godfather at the ceremony         consist of assenting to the vows.        GODMOTHER. A woman asked to be a sponsor at a         christening should immediately accept or         decline the invitation either by a written note         or a call.           She should also call on the parents and send         flowers to the mother, and express pleasure         at the compliment paid to her.           It is always customary for the godmother         to give the child a gift, such as a christening         robe, a cradle, or some piece of silver. If         the latter is sent, it should have the child's         name on it. With the gift should be sent         the sponsor's calling card, with some         appropriate sentiment on it. It is customary to         send the gift to the child itself.        GOLDEN WEDDINGS. Fifty years after the wedding-day         comes the Golden Wedding. The invitations         may bear the words: NO PRESENTS         RECEIVED, and congratulations may be extended         in accepting or declining the invitation. An         entertainment is usually provided for.           The gifts are, appropriately, articles of         gold, and this is a fitting occasion for giving         fifty gold pieces of either, five, ten, or twenty         dollar denomination. The invitations are         appropriately engraved in gold, and the         decorations golden in color.        GOVERNOR OF A STATE--HOW ADDRESSED. An official         letter begins: Sir, and ends: I have the honor,         sir, to remain your obedient servant.           A social letter begins: Dear Governor         Wilson, and ends: Believe me, most sincerely         yours.           The address on the envelope is: Governor         John J. Wilson.        GRAPES AND PLUMS should be eaten one by one, and         the pits allowed to fall noiselessly into the         half-closed hand and then transferred to the         plate.        GROOM. The groom selects his best man, usually         an unmarried intimate friend, though a married         man or widower is permissible. After         consultation with the bride he calls upon the         clergyman, the organist, the sexton, and invites         the ushers.           When he is informed by his bride of the         day selected for the wedding, he should ask         her mother to accept the day agreed upon.           He may make what present he desires to         the bride, and, if he also wishes, to the brides-         maids. If any gifts are sent to the groom,         they should bear his name or cipher.           He should furnish the bride's family with         a list of names of persons to whom he desires         to have invitations sent, designating his         preference for those to be asked to the wedding         breakfast or reception.      BEFORE CEREMONY. The day before the ceremony,         or sooner, he gives into the safe-         keeping of the best man the ring and the fee         for the clergyman.  "]]]
