CHAPTER XII.    OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THE  BOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS      The night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixote and  his squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote at  Sancho's persuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, and  over their supper Sancho said to his master, \"Senor, what a fool I should  have looked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first  adventure your worship achieved, instead of the foals of the three mares.  After all, 'a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing.'\"    \"At the same time, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"if thou hadst let me  attack them as I wanted, at the very least the emperor's gold crown and  Cupid's painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils, for I should  have taken them by force and given them into thy hands.\"    \"The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,\" said Sancho,  \"were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.\"    \"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"for it would not be right that the  accessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere fictions  and semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho-and, as a  necessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it--I  would that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instruments of  great good to the State, placing before us at every step a mirror in  which we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor is  there any similitude that shows us more faithfully what we are and ought  to be than the play and the players. Come, tell me, hast thou not seen a  play acted in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and  divers other personages were introduced? One plays the villain, another  the knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one the sharp-witted  fool, another the foolish lover; and when the play is over, and they have  put off the dresses they wore in it, all the actors become equal.\"    \"Yes, I have seen that,\" said Sancho.    \"Well then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the same thing happens in the comedy and  life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, in  short, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when it is  over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of the  garments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in the  grave.\"    \"A fine comparison!\" said Sancho; \"though not so new but that I have  heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of  chess; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own particular  office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed, jumbled up and  shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is much like ending  life in the grave.\"    \"Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,\" said  Don Quixote.    \"Ay,\" said Sancho; \"it must be that some of your worship's shrewdness  sticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to yield  good fruit if you dung it and till it; what I mean is that your worship's  conversation has been the dung that has fallen on the barren soil of my  dry wit, and the time I have been in your service and society has been  the tillage; and with the help of this I hope to yield fruit in abundance  that will not fall away or slide from those paths of good breeding that  your worship has made in my parched understanding.\"    Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's affected phraseology, and perceived that  what he said about his improvement was true, for now and then he spoke in  a way that surprised him; though always, or mostly, when Sancho tried to  talk fine and attempted polite language, he wound up by toppling over  from the summit of his simplicity into the abyss of his ignorance; and  where he showed his culture and his memory to the greatest advantage was  in dragging in proverbs, no matter whether they had any bearing or not  upon the subject in hand, as may have been seen already and will be  noticed in the course of this history.    In conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but  Sancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used to  say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left him at  liberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante's saddle, as his  master's express orders were, that so long as they were in the field or  not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped--the ancient  usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off the  bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from the  horse--never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same liberty he  had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a friendship so  unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by tradition from father  to son, that the author of this veracious history devoted some special  chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the propriety and decorum due  to a history so heroic, he did not insert therein; although at times he  forgets this resolution of his and describes how eagerly the two beasts  would scratch one another when they were together and how, when they were  tired or full, Rocinante would lay his neck across Dapple's, stretching  half a yard or more on the other side, and the pair would stand thus,  gazing thoughtfully on the ground, for three days, or at least so long as  they were left alone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for  food. I may add that they say the author left it on record that he  likened their friendship to that of Nisus and Euryalus, and Pylades and  Orestes; and if that be so, it may be perceived, to the admiration of  mankind, how firm the friendship must have been between these two  peaceful animals, shaming men, who preserve friendships with one another  so badly. This was why it was said--    For friend no longer is there friend;  The reeds turn lances now.    And some one else has sung--    Friend to friend the bug, etc.    And let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he compared  the friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have received  many lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, for  example, the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog,  watchfulness from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from the  elephant, and loyalty from the horse.    Sancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while Don Quixote  dozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only had elapsed when a  noise he heard behind him awoke him, and rising up startled, he listened  and looked in the direction the noise came from, and perceived two men on  horseback, one of whom, letting himself drop from the saddle, said to the  other, \"Dismount, my friend, and take the bridles off the horses, for, so  far as I can see, this place will furnish grass for them, and the  solitude and silence my love-sick thoughts need of.\" As he said this he  stretched himself upon the ground, and as he flung himself down, the  armour in which he was clad rattled, whereby Don Quixote perceived that  he must be a knight-errant; and going over to Sancho, who was asleep, he  shook him by the arm and with no small difficulty brought him back to his  senses, and said in a low voice to him, \"Brother Sancho, we have got an  adventure.\"    \"God send us a good one,\" said Sancho; \"and where may her ladyship the  adventure be?\"    \"Where, Sancho?\" replied Don Quixote; \"turn thine eyes and look, and thou  wilt see stretched there a knight-errant, who, it strikes me, is not over  and above happy, for I saw him fling himself off his horse and throw  himself on the ground with a certain air of dejection, and his armour  rattled as he fell.\"    \"Well,\" said Sancho, \"how does your worship make out that to be an  adventure?\"    \"I do not mean to say,\" returned Don Quixote, \"that it is a complete  adventure, but that it is the beginning of one, for it is in this way  adventures begin. But listen, for it seems he is tuning a lute or guitar,  and from the way he is spitting and clearing his chest he must be getting  ready to sing something.\"    \"Faith, you are right,\" said Sancho, \"and no doubt he is some enamoured  knight.\"    \"There is no knight-errant that is not,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let us  listen to him, for, if he sings, by that thread we shall extract the ball  of his thoughts; because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth  speaketh.\"    Sancho was about to reply to his master, but the Knight of the Grove's  voice, which was neither very bad nor very good, stopped him, and  listening "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#19)"],[1,"Skamkell, \"to know what to do,  when such mighty men have a hand in it.\"    \"That is so, sure enough,\" says Mord, \"but yet I will get to know  those things, out of Gunnar's household, which none of you will  ever know.\"    \"We would give thee money,\" they say, \"if thou wouldst search out  this thing.\"    \"That money I shall buy full dear,\" answered Mord, \"but still,  perhaps, it may be that I will look at the matter.\"    They gave him three marks of silver for lending them his help.    Then he gave them this counsel, that women should go about from  house to house with small ware, and give them to the housewives,  and mark what was given them in return.    \"For,\" he says, \"'tis the turn of mind of all men first to give  away what has been stolen, if they have it in their keeping, and  so it will be here also, if this hath-happened by the hand of  man.  Ye shall then come and show me what has been given to each  in each house, and I shall then be free from farther share in  this matter, if the truth comes to light.\"    To this they agreed, and went home afterwards.    Mord sends women about the country, and they were away half a  month.  Then they came back, and had big bundles.  Mord asked  where they had most given them?    They said that at Lithend most was given them, and Hallgerda had  been most bountiful to them.    He asked what was given them there.    \"Cheese,\" say they.    He begged to see it, and they showed it to him, and it was in  great slices.  These he took and kept.    A little after, Mord fared to see Otkell, and bade that he would  bring Thorgerda's cheese-mould; and when that was done, he laid  the slices down in it, and lo!  they fitted the mould in every  way.    Then they saw, too, that a whole cheese had been given to them.    Then Mord said, \"Now may ye see that Hallgerda must have stolen  the cheese;\" and they all passed the same judgment; and then Mord  said, that now he thought he was free of this matter.    After that they parted.    Shortly after Kolskegg fell to talking with Gunnar and said, \"Ill  is it to tell, but the story is in every man's mouth, that  Hallgerda must have stolen, and that she was at the bottom of all  that great scathe that befell at Kirkby.\"    Gunner said that he too thought that must be so.  \"But what is to  be done now?\"    Kolskegg answered, \"Thou wilt think it thy most bounden duty to  make atonement for thy wife's wrong, and methinks it were best  that thou farest to see Otkell, and makest him a handsome offer.\"    \"This is well spoken,\" says Gunnar, \"and so it shall be.\"    A little after Gunnar sent after Thrain Sigfus' son and Lambi  Sigurd's son, and they came at once.    Gunnar told them whither he meant to go, and they were well  pleased.  Gunnar rode with eleven men to Kirkby, and called  Otkell out.  Skamkell was there too, and said, \"I will go out  with thee, and it will be best now to have the balance of wit on  thy side.  And I would wish to stand closest by thee when thou  needest it most, and now this will be put to the proof.  Methinks  it were best that thou puttest on an air of great weight.\"    Then they, Otkell and Skamkell, and Hallkell, and Hallbjorn, went  out all of them.    They greeted Gunnar, and he took their greeting well.  Otkell  asks whither he meant to go?    \"No farther than here,\" says Gunnar, \"and my errand hither is to  tell thee about that bad mishap, how it arose from the plotting  of my wife and that thrall whom I bought from thee.\"    \"'Tis only what was to be looked for,\" says Hallbjorn.    \"Now I will make thee a good offer,\" says Gunnar, \"and the offer  is this, that the best men here in the country round settle the  matter.\"    \"This is a fair-sounding offer,\" said Skamkell, \"but an unfair  and uneven one.  Thou art a man who has many friends among the  householders, but Otkell has not many friends.\"    \"Well,\" says Gunnar, \"then I will offer thee that I shall make an  award, and utter it here on this spot, and so we will settle the  matter, and my good-will shall follow the settlement.  But I will  make thee an atonement by paying twice the worth of what was  lost.\"    \"This choice shalt thou not take,\" said Skamkell; \"and it is  unworthy to give up to him the right to make his own award, when  thou oughtest to have kept it for thyself.\"    So Otkell said, \"I will not give up to thee, Gunnar, the right to  make thine own award.\"    \"I see plainly,\" said Gunnar, \"the help of men who will be paid  off for it one day, I daresay; but come now, utter an award for  thyself.\"    Otkell leant toward Skamkell and said, \"What shall I answer now?\"    \"This thou shalt call a good offer, but still put thy suit into  the hands of Gizur the White, and Geir the Priest, and then many  will say this, that thou behavest like Hallkell, thy grandfather,  who was the greatest of champions.\"    \"Well offered is this, Gunnar,\" said Otkell, \"but still my will  is thou wouldst give me time to see Gizur the White.\"    \"Do now whatever thou likest in the matter,\" said Gunnar; \"but  men will say this, that thou couldst not see thine own honour  when thou wouldst have none of the choices I offer thee.\"    Then Gunnar rode home, and when he had gone away, Hallbjorn said,  \"Here I see how much man differs from man.  Gunnar made thee good  offers, but thou wouldst take none of them; or how dost thou  think to strive with Gunnar in a quarrel, when no one is his  match in fight.  But now he is still so kind-hearted a man that  it may be he will let these offers stand, though thou art only  ready to take them afterwards.  Methinks it were best that thou  farest to see Gizur the White and Geir the Priest now this very  hour.\"    Otkell let them catch his horse, and made ready in every way.  Otkell was not sharpsighted, and Skamkell walked on the way along  with him, and said to Otkell, \"Methought it strange that thy  brother would not take this toil from thee, and now I will make  thee an offer to fare instead of thee, for I know that the  journey is irksome to thee.\"    \"I will take that offer,\" says Otkell, \"but mind and be as  truthful as ever thou canst.\"    \"So it shall be,\" says Skamkell.    Then Skamkell took his horse and cloak, but Otkell walks home.    Hallbjorn was out of doors, and said to Otkell, \"Ill is it to  have a thrall for one's bosom friend, and we shall rue this for  ever that thou hast turned back, and it is an unwise step to send  the greatest liar on an errand, of which one may so speak that  men's lives hang on it.\"    \"Thou wouldst be sore afraid,\" says Otkell, \"if Gunnar had his  bill aloft, when thou art so scared now.\"    \"No one knows who will be most afraid then,\" said Hallbjorn; \"but  this thou wilt have to own, that Gunnar does not lose much time  in brandishing his bill when he is wroth.\"    \"Ah!\" said Otkell, \"ye are all of you for yielding but Skamkell.\"    And then they were both wroth.        50. OF SKAMKELL'S LYING    Skamkell came to Mossfell, and repeated all the offers to Gizur.    \"It so seems to me,\" says Gizur, \"as though these have been  bravely offered; but why took he not these offers?\"    \"The chief cause was,\" answers Skamkell, \"that all wished to show  thee honour, and that was why he waited for thy utterance;  besides, that is best for all.\"    So Skamkell stayed there the night over, but Gizur sent a man to  fetch Geir the Priest; and he came there early.  Then Gizur told  him the story and said, \"What course is to be taken now?\"    \"As thou no doubt hast already made up thy mind -- to make the  best of the business for both sides.\"    \"Now we will let Skamkell tell his tale a second time, and see  how he repeats it.\"    So they did that, and Gizur said, \"Thou must have told this story  right; but still I have seen thee to be the wickedest of men, and  there is no faith in faces if thou turnest out well.\"    Skamkell fared home, and rides first to Kirkby and calls Otkell  out.  He greets Skamkell well, and Skamkell brought him the  greeting of Gizur and Geir.    \"But about this matter of the suit,\" he says, \"there is no need  to speak softly, how that it is the will of both Gizur and Geir  that this suit should not be settled in a friendly way.  They  gave that counsel that a summons should be set on foot, and that  Gunnar should be summoned for having partaken of the goods, but  Hallgerda for stealing them.\"    \"It shall be done,\" said Otkell, \"in everything as they have  given counsel.\"    \"They thought most of this,\" says Skamkell, \"that thou hadst  behaved so proudly; but as for me, I made as great a man of thee  in everything as I could.\"    Now Otkell tells all this to his brothers, and Hallbjorn said,  \"This must be the biggest lie.\"    Now the time goes on until the last of the summoning days before  the Althing came.    Then Otkell called on his brothers and Skamkell to ride on the  business of the summons to Lithend.    Hallbjorn said he would go, but said also that they would rue  this summoning as time went on.    Now they rode twelve of them together to Lithend, but when they  came into the \"town,\" there was Gunnar out of doors, and knew  naught of their coming till they had ridden right up to the  house.    He did not go in-doors then, and Otkell thundered out the summons  there and then; but when they had made an end of the summoning  Skamkell said, \"Is it all right, master?\"    \"Ye know that best;\" says Gunnar, \"but I will put thee in mind of  this journey one of these days, and of thy good help.\"    \"That will not harm us,\" says Skamkell, \"if thy bill be not  aloft.\"    Gunnar was very wroth and went in-doors, and told Kolskegg, and  Kolskegg said, \"Ill was it that we were not out of doors; they  should have come here on the most shameful journey, if we had  been by.\"    \"Everything bides its time,\" says Gunnar; \"but this journey will  not turn out to their honour.\"    A little after Gunnar went and told Njal.    \"Let it not worry thee a jot,\" said Njal, \"for this will be "]]]
