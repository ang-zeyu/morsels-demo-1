To those who know the skunk only from reputation, my words might seem  too strong; many, however, who have come to close quarters with the  little animal will think them ridiculously weak. And consider what must  the feelings be of one who has had the following experience--not an  uncommon experience on the pampas. There is to be a dance at a  neighbouring house a few miles away; he has been looking forward to it,  and, dressing himself with due care, mounts his horse and sets out full  of joyous anticipations. It is a dark windy evening, but there is a  convenient bridle-path through the dense thicket of giant thistles, and  striking it he puts his horse into a swinging gallop. Unhappily the path  is already occupied by a skunk, invisible in the darkness, that, in  obedience to the promptings of its insane instinct, refuses to get out  of it, until the flying hoofs hit it and sand it like a well-kicked  football into the thistles. But the forefoot of the horse, up as high as  his knees perhaps, have been sprinkled, and the rider, after coming out  into the open, dismounts and walks away twenty yards from his animal,  and literally _smells_ himself all over, and with a feeling of profound  relief pronounces himself Not the minutest drop of the diabolical spray  has touched his dancing shoes! Springing into the saddle he proceeds to  his journey's end, is warmly welcomed by his host, and speedily  forgetting his slight misadventure, mingles with a happy crowd of  friends. In a little while people begin exchanging whispers and  significant glances; men are seen smiling at nothing in particular; the  hostess wears a clouded face; the ladies cough and put their scented  handkerchiefs to their noses, and presently they begin to feel faint and  retire from the room. Our hero begins to notice that there is something  wrong, and presently discovers its cause; he, unhappily, has been the  last person in the room to remark that familiar but most abominable  odour, rising like a deadly exhalation from the floor, conquering all  other odours, and every moment becoming more powerful. A drop _has_  touched his shoe after all; and fearing to be found out, and edging  towards the door, he makes his escape, and is speedily riding home  again; knowing full well that his sudden and early departure from the  scene will be quickly discovered and set down to the right cause.    In that not always trustworthy book _The Natural History of Chili,_  Molina tells us how they deal with the animal in the trans-Andine  regions. \"When one appears,\" he says, \"some of the company begiu by  caressing it, until an opportunity offers for one of them to seize it by  the tail. In this position the muscles become contracted, the animal is  unable to eject its fluid, and is quickly despatched.\" One might just as  well talk of caressing a cobra de capello; yet this laughable fiction  finds believers all over South and North America. Professor Baird  gravely introduces it into his great work on the mammalia. I was once  talking about animals in a rancho, when a person present (an Argentine  officer) told that, while visiting an Indian encampment, he had asked  the savages how they contrived to kill skunks without making even a life  in the desert intolerable. A grave old Cacique informed him that the  secret was to go boldly up to the animal, take it by the tail, and  despatch it; for, he said, when you fear it not at all, then it respects  your courage and dies like a lamb--sweetly. The officer, continuing his  story, said that on quitting the Indian camp he started a skunk, and,  glad of an opportunity to test the truth of what he had heard,  dismounted and proceeded to put the Indian plan in practice. Here the  story abruptly ended, and when I eagerly demanded to hear the sequel,  the amateur hunter of furs lit a cigarette and vacantly watched the  ascending smoke. The Indians aro grave jokers, they seldom smile; and  this old traditional skunk-joke, which has run the length of a  continent, finding its way into many wise books, is their revenge on a  superior race.    I have shot a great many eagles, and occasionally a carancho (Polyborus  tharus), with the plumage smelling strongly of skunk, which shows that  these birds, pressed by hunger, often commit the fearful mistake of  attacking the animal. My friend Mr. Ernest Gibson, of Buenos Ayres, in a  communication to the _Ibis,_ describes an encounter he actually  witnessed between a carancho and a skunk. Riding home one afternoon, he  spied a skunk \"shuffling along in the erratic manner usual to that  odoriferous quadruped;\" following it at a very short distance was an  eagle-vulture, evidently bent on mischief. Every time the bird came near  the bushy tail rose menacingly; then the carancho would fall behind,  and, after a few moments' hesitation, follow on again. At length,  growing bolder, it sprung forward, seizing the threatening tail with its  claw, but immediately after \"began staggering about with dishevelled  plumage, tearful eyes, and a profoundly woe-begone expression on its  vulture face. The skunk, after turning and regarding its victim with an  I-told-you-so look for a few moments, trotted unconcernedly off.\"    I was told in Patagonia by a man named Molinos, who was frequently  employed by the Government as guide to expeditions in the desert, that  everywhere throughout that country the skunk is abundant. Some years ago  he was sent with two other men to find and treat with an Indian chief  whose whereabouts were not known. Far in the interior Molinos was  overtaken by a severe winter, his horses died of thirst and fatigue, and  during the three bitterest months of the year he kept himself and his  followers alive by eating the flesh of skunks, the only wild animal that  never failed them. No doubt, on those vast sterile plains where the  skunk abounds, and goes about by day and by night careless of enemies,  the terrible nature of its defensive weapon is the first lesson  experience teaches to every young eagle, fox, wild cat, and puma.    Dogs kill skunks when made to do so, but it is not a sport they delight  in. One moonlight night, at home, I went out to where the dogs, twelve  in number, were sleeping: while I stood there a skunk appeared and  deliberately came towards me, passing through the dogs where they lay,  and one by one as he passed them they rose up, and, with their tails  between their legs, skulked off. When made to kill skunks often they  become seasoned; but always perform the loathsome task expeditiously,  then rush away with frothing mouths to rub their faces in the wet clay  and rid themselves of the fiery sensation. At one time I possessed only  one dog that could be made to face a skunk, and as the little robbers  were very plentiful, and continually coining about the house in their  usual open, bold way, it was rather hard for the poor brute. This dog  detested them quite as strongly as the others, only he was more  obedient, faithful, and brave. Whenever I bade him attack one of them  he would come close up to me and look up into my face with piteous  pleading eyes, then, finding that he was not to be let off from the  repulsive task, he would charge upon the doomed animal with a blind fury  wonderful to see. Seizing it between his teeth, he would shake it madly,  crushing its bones, then hurl it several feet from him, only to rush  again and again upon it to repeat the operation, doubtless with a  Caligula-like wish in his frantic breast that all the skunks on the  globe had but one backbone.    I was once on a visit to a sheep-farming brother, far away on the  southern frontier of Buenos Ayres, and amongst the dogs I found there  was one most interesting creature, He was a great, lumbering, stupid,  good-tempered brute, so greedy that when you offered him a piece of meat  he would swallow half your arm, and so obedient that at a word he would  dash himself against the horns of a bull, and face death and danger in  any shape. But, my brother told me, he would not face a skunk--he would  die first. One day I took him out and found a skunk, and for upwards of  half an hour I sat on my horse vainly cheering on my cowardly follower,  and urging him to battle. The very sight of the enemy gave him a fit of  the shivers; and when the irascible little enemy began to advance  against us, going through the performance by means of which he generally  puts his foes to flight without resorting to malodorous  measures--stamping his little feet in rage, jumping up, spluttering and  hissing and flourishing his brush like a warlike banner above his  head--then hardly could I restrain my dog from turning tail and flying  home in abject terror. My cruel persistence was rewarded at last.  Continued shouts, cheers, and hand-clappings began to stir the brute to  a kind of frenzy. Torn by conflicting emotions, he began to revolve  about the skunk at a lumbering gallop, barking, howling, and bristling  up his hair; and at last, shutting his eyes, and with a yell of  desperation, he charged. I fully expected to see the enemy torn to  pieces in a few seconds, but when the dog was still four or five feet  from him the fatal discharge came, and he dropped down as if shot dead.  For some time he lay on the earth perfectly motionless, watched and  gently bedewed by the victorious skunk; then he got up and crept whining  away. Gradually he quickened his pace, finally breaking into a frantic  run. In vain I followed him, shouting at the top of my lungs; he stayed  not to listen, and very speedily vanished from sight--a white speck on  the vast level plain. At noon on the following day he made his  appearance, gaunt and befouled with mud, staggering forward like a  galvanized skeleton. Too worn out even to eat, he flung himself down,  and for hours lay like a dead thing, sleeping off the effects of those  few drops of perfume.    Dogs, I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#19)"],[1,"rs'  charts were surreptitiously copied or actually stolen--for the loose  manner in which the affair has been related in some books renders  doubtful which of the two accusations the authors desired to make.* (*  Blair, Cyclopaedia of Australasia page 131, actually says that Baudin,  \"having taken copies of Flinders' charts, sailed for France, where he  published a book and received great applause from the French nation, who  called him the greatest discoverer of the present century.\"  Spirit-writing one has heard of, but not even the Psychical Research  Society has recorded the case of a dead man copying hydrographical  charts. A similar disregard of the fact that Baudin died before the  return of his ships occurs in J.E. Tenison Woods' History of Exploration  in Australia (1865) volume 1 page 174, where we are informed that  Flinders was detained in Mauritius, because \"at that time the Emperor  Napoleon was obliging Admiral Baudin [sic] to usurp the glory of his  discoveries\"; a case of post-mortem promotion.) Not only is there no  evidence to support any such charge, but Flinders himself never accused  Decaen of making an improper use of the papers in the trunk, nor did he  ever allege that the two charts contained in the French atlas of 1807, or  those in Freycinet's folio atlas of 1812--which he probably saw before  his death in July 1814--were founded upon or owed anything to his  drawings. He simply set forth the facts with his habitual exactness and  fairness; and where Flinders was just, there is surely no warrant for  others to perpetuate an accusation which originated in a period of  intense national hatred and jealousy, and bears its birth-mark upon it.    A critical examination of Freycinet's charts is alone sufficient to  shatter the opinion that he utilised the drawings of the English  navigator. Had he even seen them, his own work would have been more  accurate than it was, and his large chart of New Holland would have been  more complete. It has already been shown that the French chart of the  so-called Terre Napoleon coasts was in large measure defective, many  capes, islands, and bays being represented that have no existence in  fact, and a large portion of the outline being crudely and erroneously  drawn. Not only so, but if Freycinet had had copies of Flinders' charts  before him, use would certainly have been made of them to give greater  completeness to the eastern and north-western shores. Flinders, in his  last voyage in the Investigator, had made important discoveries on the  Queensland coast and in the Gulf of Carpentaria. He had discovered, for  instance, Port Bowen and Port Curtis, which had been missed by Cook, had  given greater definiteness to the islands near the southern end of the  Great Barrier Reef, and had made a dangerous acquaintance with the Reef  itself, discovering one narrow alley through it which is marked on modern  maps as Flinders' Passage. In the Gulf of Carpentaria he had also done  some entirely original work. He had shown, for example, that Cape Van  Diemen, represented as a projection from the mainland on all previous  maps, was really part of an island, which he named Mornington Isle.  Freycinet's charts reveal not the faintest trace of the fresh discoveries  which Flinders had achieved around east and north-east Australia, nor do  they in any particular indicate that their manifold serious imperfections  had been corrected by reference to Flinders' superb charts. In short, the  French work, though beautifully engraved and printed, was, in a  geographical sense, for the most part too poor to justify the suspicion  that Freycinet received aid from the drawings of the persevering captain  of the Investigator.    The circumstances attending the imprisonment of Flinders, and the  precipitate haste with which Freycinet's work was pushed forward,  undoubtedly furnished prima facie justification for the suspicion,  indignantly voiced by contemporary English writers, and which has been  hardened into a direct accusation since, that an act of plagiarism was  committed, dishonest in itself, and doubly guilty from the circumstances  in which it was performed. The Quarterly reviewer of 1817* pointed out  that the few charts in Freycinet's atlas \"ARE VERY LIKE THOSE OF CAPTAIN  FLINDERS, ONLY MUCH INFERIOR IN POINT OF EXECUTION.\" (* Volume 17 pages  229 to 230; the italics are the reviewer's. The plagiarism legend--for  such it is--originated with this Quarterly article. The earliest  biographer of Flinders, in the Naval Chronicle 32 page 177, wrote very  strongly of General Decaen, considering that he was \"worthy of his  Corsican master,\" and that his name \"will be consigned to infamy as long  as mankind shall consider it honourable to promote science and civilised  to practise hospitality,\" but alleged no improper use of the charts. C.A.  Walckenaer, who wrote the excellent life of Flinders in the Biographie  Universelle, published in 1856, said that the French Government was  \"inexcusable d'avoir retenu Flinders en captivite,\" but denied that his  charts were improperly used, and promised that when he came to write the  life of Peron in a succeeding volume, he would by an analysis of the  evidence refute the story. But Walckenaer died in 1852, before his  Flinders article was published, and the author of the article on Peron  did not carry out his predecessor's undertaking. It is to be presumed  that Walckenaer would have exhibited the facts set out above. Alfred de  Lacaze, in his article on Flinders in the Nouvelle Biographie Generale 17  932, wrote that the excuses given for the imprisonment of Flinders formed  \"pauvres pretextes\"; but declared that the seals put on Flinders' papers  in Mauritius were \"loyalement respecte pendant les six ans que dura la  captivite du navigateur anglais.\" That was true. It is a pleasure to  acknowledge that all the references to Flinders which the author has seen  in French works unanimously and strongly condemn the treatment of him,  and do ample justice to his splendid qualities.) They are very like in  one respect, namely, in the representation of Spencer's and St. Vincent's  Gulfs and Kangaroo Island. In other particulars, at all events as far as  relates to the Terre Napoleon coasts, the French charts are quite unlike  those of Flinders. But contemporaries--knowing that Flinders' charts had  been taken from him by Decaen, and that he had been held in captivity  until the French could finish their work, and then, comparing his charts  with Freycinet's, finding that parts of the coasts discovered by the  English captain were well represented on the French charts, while other  parts of the outline of Terra Australis were badly done or  inadequate--not unnaturally drew the inference that the well-drawn  sections were based upon drawings improperly acquired. If the chain of  evidence was not complete, the violent racial animosities then prevalent  moulded the missing links in the fervent heat of imagination.    But it is quite easy to account for the superior cartography of the two  gulfs and Kangaroo Island. Le Geographe visited this region twice. In  April 1802, after meeting Flinders in Encounter Bay, Baudin sailed west,  and endeavoured to penetrate the two gulfs. But his corvette drew too  much water to permit him to go far, and he determined to give up the  attempt, and to devote \"une seconde campagne\" to \"la reconnaissance  complete de ces deux grands enfoncements.\"* (* Voyage de Decouvertes 3  11.) In Sydney, Governor King permitted him to purchase a small locally  constructed vessel of light draught--called the Casuarina, because she  was built of she-oak--with which to explore rivers and shallow waters.  The command of this boat was entrusted to Lieutenant Louis de Freycinet,  the future cartographer and part historian of the expedition; and the  charts of the two gulfs and Kangaroo Island were made by, or under the  superintendence of, that officer. Freycinet was not with Le Geographe on  her first cruise in these waters, and was not responsible for the  original drawings upon which his charts of the Terre Napoleon coasts  eastward of Cape Jervis were founded. But the fact that he surveyed the  gulfs and Kangaroo Island on the second visit, in 1803, is quite  sufficient to account for the improved cartography of this region in the  French atlas. Whatever we may think of the part played by Freycinet in  relation to Flinders and the history of the expedition, his professional  ability was of a high character. All the charting work done by him, when  he had not to depend upon the rough drawings of inferior men, was very  good. His interest in scientific navigation was deep, and when, in 1817,  he was given the command of a fresh French expedition, consisting of the  Uranie and the Physicienne, the large folio atlas produced by him  indicated that he had studied the technicalities of his profession to  excellent purpose.    The superiority of the work done by Baudin's expedition in the vicinity  of the two gulfs, then, was not due to any fraudulent use of Flinders'  material, but simply to the fact that there was a competent officer in  charge of it at that time; and there is nothing on the charts for which  Freycinet was personally responsible to justify the belief that his work  claiming to be original was not genuinely his own. When, in 1824, he  published a second edition of the Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres  Australes,* (* In octavo volumes; the first edition was in quarto.) he  repudiated with quiet dignity the suggestion that the work of the English  navigator had been plagiarised.* (* \"C'est assez,\" he wrote, \"repousser  des accusations odieuses et envenimees, fondees sur des idees  chimeriques, avec absence de toute espece de preuve. Le temps, qui calme  les passions humaines et permet toujours a la verite de reprendre ses  droits, fera justice d'accusations concues avec legerete et soutenues  avec"]]]
