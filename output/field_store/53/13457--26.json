After the warrior's story was finished, I asked the old woman the  meaning of the blue lines on her chin, looking all the while out of the  corners of my eyes at the warrior with the star on his forehead. I was a  little afraid that he would rebuke me for my boldness.    Here the old woman began: \"Why, my grandchild, they are signs,--secret  signs I dare not tell you. I shall, however, tell you a wonderful story  about a woman who had a cross tattooed upon each of her cheeks.\"    It was a long story of a woman whose magic power lay hidden behind the  marks upon her face. I fell asleep before the story was completed.    Ever after that night I felt suspicious of tattooed people. Wherever I  saw one I glanced furtively at the mark and round about it, wondering  what terrible magic power was covered there.    It was rarely that such a fearful story as this one was told by the camp  fire. Its impression was so acute that the picture still remains vividly  clear and pronounced.          III.    THE BEADWORK.      Soon after breakfast mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright,  clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our  wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of  slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our  dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from newly  burnt prairie.    Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag,  my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as  an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she  smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a  beaded case that hung on the left of her wide belt a long, narrow blade,  she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small  moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in  her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In  imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting  moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red  beads decorating my feet.    Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one  hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical  observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely  twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one.  With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with  the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them  with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every  stitch.    It took many trials before I learned how to knot my sinew thread on the  point of my finger, as I saw her do. Then the next difficulty was in  keeping my thread stiffly twisted, so that I could easily string my  beads upon it. My mother required of me original designs for my lessons  in beading. At first I frequently ensnared many a sunny hour into  working a long design. Soon I learned from self-inflicted punishment to  refrain from drawing complex patterns, for I had to finish whatever I  began.    After some experience I usually drew easy and simple crosses and  squares. These were some of the set forms. My original designs were not  always symmetrical nor sufficiently characteristic, two faults with  which my mother had little patience. The quietness of her oversight made  me feel strongly responsible and dependent upon my own judgment. She  treated me as a dignified little individual as long as I was on my good  behavior; and how humiliated I was when some boldness of mine drew forth  a rebuke from her!    In the choice of colors she left me to my own taste. I was pleased with  an outline of yellow upon a background of dark blue, or a combination of  red and myrtle-green. There was another of red with a bluish-gray that  was more conventionally used. When I became a little familiar with  designing and the various pleasing combinations of color, a harder  lesson was given me. It was the sewing on, instead of beads, some tinted  porcupine quills, moistened and flattened between the nails of the thumb  and forefinger. My mother cut off the prickly ends and burned them at  once in the centre fire. These sharp points were poisonous, and worked  into the flesh wherever they lodged. For this reason, my mother said, I  should not do much alone in quills until I was as tall as my cousin  Warca-Ziwin.    Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits,  and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a  summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the  hills with me. We each carried a light sharpened rod about four feet  long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all  the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off  into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found  little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature's  rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small  bird's egg. Soon satiated with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum,  to return again to the sweet roots.    I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and  sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one  another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of  things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their  various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of  the prairie we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted  cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and  bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.    While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near  relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in  undertones, \"Han! han!\" (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for  breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more  thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these  interjections. In these impersonations our parents were led to say only  those things that were in common favor.    No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting  of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our  impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played  among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and  calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs on that  Dakota sea of rolling green.    On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch  up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide  after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care,  I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then  again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow  escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step  beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my  fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it  glided before me, while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my  speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also.  Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded  in the hillside.    So! my shadow had the impudence to sit down beside me!    Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running  away so fast.    \"Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn't you ever do that?\" I inquired,  surprised that they should not understand.    They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and  I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then  we gave up trying to catch my shadow.    Before this peculiar experience I have no distinct memory of having  recognized any vital bond between myself and my own shadow. I never gave  it an afterthought.    Returning our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. That  evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.          IV.    THE COFFEE-MAKING.      One summer afternoon my mother left me alone in our wigwam while she  went across the way to my aunt's dwelling.    I did not much like to stay alone in our tepee for I feared a tall,  broad-shouldered crazy man, some forty years old, who walked loose among  the hills. Wiyaka-Napbina (Wearer of a Feather Necklace) was harmless,  and whenever he came into a wigwam he was driven there by extreme  hunger. He went nude except for the half of a red blanket he girdled  around his waist. In one tawny arm he used to carry a heavy bunch of  wild sunflowers that he gathered in his aimless ramblings. His black  hair was matted by the winds, and scorched into a dry red by the  constant summer sun. As he took great strides, placing one brown bare  foot directly in front of the other, he swung his long lean arm to and  fro.    Frequently he paused in his walk and gazed far backward, shading his  eyes with his hand. He was under the belief that an evil spirit was  haunting his steps. This was what my mother told me once, when I  sneered at such a silly big man. I was brave when my mother was near by,  and Wiyaka-Napbina walking farther and farther away.    \"Pity the man, my child. I knew him when he was a brave and handsome  youth. He was overtaken by a malicious spirit among the hills, one day,  when he went hither and thither after his ponies. Since then he can not  stay away from the hills,\" she said.    I felt so sorry for the man in his misfortune that I prayed to the Great  Spirit to restore him. But though I pitied him at a distance, I was  still afraid of him when he appeared near our wigwam.    Thus, when my mother left me by myself that afternoon I sat in a fearful  mood within our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#2)"],[1,"P.

The earth was  idle and void and covered with darkness. And the spirit of God was borne  on the waters, and God said: Be made light, and anon light was made. And  God saw that light was good, and divided the light from darkness, and  called the light day and darkness night.    And thus was made light with heaven and earth first, and even and  morning was made one day. The second day he made the firmament, and  divided the waters that were under the firmament from them that were  above, and called the firmament heaven. The third day were made on the  earth herbs and fruits in their kind. The fourth day God made the sun  and moon and stars, etc. The fifth day he made the fishes in the water  and birds in the air. The sixth day God made the beasts on the earth,  every one in his kind and gender. And God saw that all these works were  good and said: Make we man unto our similitude and image. Here spake the  Father to the Son and Holy Ghost, or else as it were the common voice of  three persons, when it was said make we, and to our, in plural number.  Man was made to the image of God in his soul. Here it is to be noted  that he made not only the soul with the body, but he made both body and  soul. As to the body he made male and female. God gave to man the  lordship and power upon living beasts. Thus in six days was heaven and  earth made and all the ornation of them. And then he made the seventh  day on which he rested, not for that he was weary, but ceased his  operation, and showed the seventh day which he blessed. Thus he shortly  showed the generations of heaven and earth, for here he determined the  works of the six days and the seventh day he sanctified and made holy.  God had planted in the beginning Paradise a place of desire and delices.  And man was made in the field of Damascus; he was made of the slime of  the earth. Paradise was made the third day of creation, and was beset  with herbs, plants and trees, and is a place of most mirth and joy. In  the midst whereof be set two trees, that is the tree of life, and that  other the tree of knowing good and evil. And there is a well, which  casteth out water for to water the trees and herbs of Paradise. This  well is the mother of all waters, which well is divided into four parts.  One part is called Phison. This goeth about Inde. The second is called  Gijon, otherwise Nilus, and that runneth about Ethiopia, the other two  be called Tigris and Euphrates. Tigris runneth toward Assyria, and  Euphrates is called fruitful, which runneth in Chaldea. These four  floods come and spring out of the same well, and depart, and yet in some  place some of them meet again.    Then God took man from the place of his creation and brought him into  Paradise, for to work there, not to labor needily, but in delighting and  recreating him, and that he should keep Paradise. For like as Paradise  should refresh him, so should he labor to serve God, and there God gave  him a commandment. Every commandment standeth in two things, in doing or  forbidding, in doing he commanded him to eat of all the trees of  Paradise, in forbidding he commanded that he should not eat of the tree  of the knowledge of good and evil. This commandment was given to the  man, and by the man it went to the woman. For when the woman was made it  was commanded to them both, and hereto he set a pain, saying: Whatsoever  day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die by death.    God said: It is not good a man to be alone, make we to him an helper  like to himself for to bring forth children. Adam supposed that some  helper to him had been among the beasts which had been like to him.  Therefore God brought to Adam all living beasts of the earth and air, in  which he understood them of the water also, which with one commandment  all came tofore him. They were brought for two causes, one was because  man should give to each of them a name, by which they should know that  he should dominate over them, and the second cause was because Adam  should know that there was none of them like to him. And he named them  in the Hebrew tongue, which was only the language and none other at the  beginning. And so none being found like unto him, God sent in Adam a  lust to sleep, which was no dream, but as is supposed in an extasy or in  a trance; in which was showed to him the celestial court. Wherefore when  he awoke he prophesied of the conjunction of Christ to his church, and  of the flood that was to come, and of the doom and destruction of the  world by fire he knew, which afterward he told to his children.    Whiles that Adam slept, God took one of his ribs, both flesh and bone,  and made that a woman, and set her tofore Adam. Which then said: This is  now a bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; and Adam gave her a name  like as her lord, and said she should be called virago, which is as much  as to say as made of a man, and is a name taken of a man. And anon, the  name giving, he prophesied, saying: Because she is taken of the side of  a man, therefore a man shall forsake and leave father and mother and  abide and be adherent unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh;  and though they be two persons, yet in matrimony and wedlock they be but  one flesh, and in other things twain. For why, neither of them had power  of his own flesh. They were both naked and were not ashamed, for they  stood both in the state of innocence. Then the serpent which was hotter  than any beast of the earth and naturally deceivable, for he was full  of the devil Lucifer, which was deject and cast out of heaven, had great  envy to man that was bodily in Paradise, and knew well, if he might make  him to trespass and break God's commandments, that he should be cast out  also.    Yet he was afeard to be taken or espied of the man, he went to the  woman, not so prudent and more prone to slide and bow. And in the form  of the serpent, for then the serpent was erect as a man. Bede saith that  he chose a serpent having a maiden's cheer [face], for like oft apply to  like, and spake by the tongue of the serpent to Eve, and said: Why  commanded you God that ye should not eat of all the trees of Paradise?  This he said to find occasion to say that he was come for. Then the  woman answered and said: Ne forte moriamur, lest haply we die, which she  said doubting, for lightly she was flexible to every part. Whereunto  anon he answered: Nay in no wise ye shall die, but God would not that ye  should be like him in science, and knowing that when ye eat of this tree  ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil, he as envious forbade you.  And anon the woman, elate in pride and willing to be like to God,  accorded thereto and believed him. The woman saw that the tree was fair  to look on, and clean and sweet of savor, took and ate thereof, and gave  unto Adam of the same, happily desiring him by fair words. But Adam anon  agreed, for when he saw the woman not dead he supposed that God had said  that they should die to fear them with, and then ate of the fruit  forbidden. And anon their sight was opened that they saw their  nakedness, and then anon they understood that they had trespassed. And  thus they knew that they were naked, and they took fig leaves and sewed  them together for to cover their members in manner of breeches.    And anon after, they heard the voice of our Lord God walking, and anon  they hied him. Our Lord called the"]]]
