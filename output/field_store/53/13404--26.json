It resembles the Central Asian states in    its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low    standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,    and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline    for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate    the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,    marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim    Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan    accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former    Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet    republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but    its considerable energy resources brighten its propects somewhat. Old    economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced. A particularly galling    constraint on economic revival is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to    consume 25% of Azerbaijan's economic resources.

Consul_ thinking  it was a fly, struck at him with his hand, without even looking up; but  when he felt the constable his hand, he jumped up and asked him what he  wanted? Whereupon the fellow answered, \"Oh, only a louse was creeping  there, and I would have caught it.\"    At such impudence his worship was so exceeding wroth that he struck the  constable on the mouth, and ordered him, on pain of heavy punishment, to  leave the room.    Hereupon he turned to the Sheriff, and cried, angrily, \"Why, in the name  of all the ten devils, is it thus your lordship keeps the constable in  order? and truly, in this whole matter, there is something which passes my  understanding.\" But the Sheriff answered, \"Not so; should you not  understand it all when you think upon the eels?\"    Hereat _Dom. Consul_ of a sudden turned ghastly pale, and began to  tremble, as it appeared to me, and called the Sheriff aside into another  chamber. I have never been able to learn what that about the eels could  mean.--    Meanwhile _Dominus Camerarius_ Gebhard Wenzel sat biting his pen, and  looking furiously--now at me, and now at my child, but said not a word;  neither did he answer _Scriba_, who often whispered somewhat into his ear,  save by a growl. At length both their worships came back into the chamber  together, and _Dom. Consul_, after he and the Sheriff had seated  themselves, began to reproach my poor child violently, saying that she had  sought to make a disturbance in the worshipful court; that his lordship  had shown him the very dog which had scratched his nose, and that,  moreover, the fact had been sworn to by the old housekeeper.    (Truly _she_ was not likely to betray him, for the old harlot had lived  with him for years, and she had a good big boy by him, as will be seen  hereafter.)    _Item_, he said that so many _indicia_ of her guilt had come to light,  that it was impossible to believe anything she might say; she was  therefore to give glory to God, and openly to confess everything, so as to  soften her punishment; whereby she might perchance, in pity for her youth,  escape with life, etc.    Hereupon he put his spectacles on his nose, and began to cross-question  her, during near four hours, from a paper which he held in his hand. These  were the main articles, as far as we both can remember:    _Quaestio_. Whether she could bewitch?    _Responsio_. No; she knew nothing of witchcraft.    _Q_. Whether she could charm?    _R_. Of that she knew as little.    _Q_. Whether she had ever been on the Blocksberg?    _R_. That was too far off for her; she knew few hills save the  Streckelberg, where she had been very often.    _Q_. What had she done there?    _R_. She had looked out over the sea, or gathered flowers; _item_, at  times carried home an apronful of dry brushwood.    _Q_. Whether she had ever called upon the devil there?    _R_. That had never come into her mind.    _Q_. Whether, then, the devil had appeared to her there, uncalled?    _R_. God defend her from such a thing.    _Q_. So she could not bewitch?    _R_. No.    _Q_. What, then, befell Kit Zuter his spotted cow, that it suddenly died  in her presence?    _R_. She did not know; and that was a strange question.    _Q_. Then it would be as strange a question, why Katie Berow her little  pig had died?    _R_. Assuredly; she wondered what they would lay to her charge.    _Q_. Then she had not bewitched them?    _R_. No; God forbid it.    _Q_. Why, then, if she were innocent, had she promised old Katie another  little pig, when her sow should litter?    _R_. She did that out of kind-heartedness. (And hereupon she began to weep  bitterly, and said she plainly saw that she had to thank old Lizzie Kolken  for all this, inasmuch as she had often threatened her when she would not  fulfil all her greedy desires, for she wanted everything that came in her  way; moreover, that Lizzie had gone all about the village when the cattle  were bewitched, persuading the people that if only a pure maid pulled a  few hairs out of the beasts' tails they would get better. That she pitied  them, and knowing herself to be a maid, went to help them; and indeed, at  first it cured them, but latterly not.)    _Q_. What cattle had she cured?    _R_. Zabel his red cow; _item_, Witthan her pig, and old Lizzie's own cow.    _Q_. Why could she afterwards cure them no more?    _R_. She did not know, but thought--albeit she had no wish to fyle any  one--that old Lizzie Kolken, who for many a long year had been in common  repute as a witch, had done it all, and bewitched the cows in her name and  then charmed them back again, as she pleased, only to bring her to  misfortune.    _Q_. Why, then, had old Lizzie bewitched her own cow, _item_, suffered her  own pig to die, if it was she that had made all the disturbance in the  village, and could really charm?    _R_. She did not know; but belike there was some one (and here she looked  at the Sheriff) who paid her double for it all.    _Q_. It was in vain that she sought to shift the guilt from off herself;  had she not bewitched old Paasch his crop, nay, even her own father's, and  caused it to be trodden down by the devil, _item_, conjured all the  caterpillars into her father's orchard?    _R_. The question was almost as monstrous as the deed would have been.  There sat her father, and his worship might ask him whether she ever had  shown herself an undutiful child to him. (Hereupon I would have risen to  speak, but _Dom. Consul_ suffered me not to open my mouth, but went on  with his examination; whereupon I remained silent and downcast.)    _Q_. Whether she did likewise deny that it was through her malice that the  woman Witthan had given birth to a devil's imp, which straight-way started  up and flew out at the window, so that when the midwife sought for it it  had disappeared?    _R_. Truly she did; and indeed she had all the days of her life done good  to the people instead of harm, for during the terrible famine she had  often taken the bread out of her own mouth to share it among the others,  especially the little children. To this the whole parish must needs bear  witness, if they were asked; whereas witches and warlocks always did evil  and no good to men, as our Lord Jesus taught (Matt. xii.), when the  Pharisees blasphemed him, saying that he cast out devils by Beelzebub the  prince of the devils; hence his worship might see whether she could in  truth be a witch.    _Q_. He would soon teach her to talk of blasphemies; he saw that her  tongue was well hung; but she must answer the questions he asked her, and  say nothing more. The question was not _what_ good she had done to the  poor, but _wherewithal_ she had done it; she must now show how she and her  father had of a sudden grown so rich that she could go pranking about in  silken raiment, whereas she used to be so very poor?    Hereupon she looked towards me, and said, \"Father, shall I tell?\"  Whereupon I answered, \"Yes, my child, now thou must openly tell all, even  though we thereby become beggars.\" She accordingly told how, when our need  was sorest, she had found the amber, and how much we had gotten for it  from the Dutch merchants.    _Q_. What were the names of these merchants?    _R_. Dieterich von Pehnen and Jakob Kiekebusch; but, as we have heard from  a schipper, they since died of the plague at Stettin.    _Q_. Why had we said nothing of such a godsend?    _R_. Out of fear of our enemy the Sheriff, who, as it seemed, had  condemned us to die of hunger, inasmuch as he forbade the parishioners,  under pain of heavy displeasure, to supply us with anything, saying, that  he would send them a better parson.    Hereupon _Dom. Consul_ again looked the Sheriff sharply in the face, who  answered that it was true he had said this, seeing that the parson had  preached at him in the most scandalous manner from the pulpit; but that he  knew very well, at the time, that they were far enough from dying of  hunger.    _Q_. How came so much amber on the Streckelberg? She had best confess at  once that the devil had brought it to her.    _R_. She knew nothing about that. But there was a great vein of amber  there, as she could show to them all that very day; and she had broken out  the amber, and covered the hole well over with fir-twigs, so that none  should find it.    _Q_. When had she gone up the Streckelberg; by day or by night?    _R_. Hereupon she blushed, and for a moment held her peace; but presently  made answer, \"Sometimes by day, and sometimes by night.\"    _Q_. Why did she hesitate? She had better make a full confession of all,  so that her punishment might be less heavy. Had she not there given over  old Seden to Satan, who had carried him off through the air, and left only  a part of his hair and brains sticking to the top of an oak?    _R_. She did not know whether that was his hair and brains at all, nor how  it came there. She went to the tree one morning because she heard a  woodpecker cry so dolefully. _Item_, old Paasch, who also had heard the  cries, came up with his axe in his hand.    _Q_. Whether the woodpecker was not the devil himself, who had carried off  old Seden?    _R_. She did not know: but he must have been dead some time, seeing that  the blood and brains which the lad fetched down out of the tree were quite  dried up.    _Q_. How and when, then, had he come by his death?    _R_. That Almighty God only knew. But Zuter his little girl had said, that  one day, while she gathered nettles for the cows under Seden his hedge,  she heard the goodman threaten his squint-eyed wife that he would tell the  parson that he now knew of a certainty that she had a familiar spirit;  whereupon the goodman had presently disappeared. But that this was a  child's tale, and she would fyle no one on the strength of it.    Hereupon _Dom. Consul_ again looked the Sheriff steadily in the face, and  said, \"Old Lizzie Kolken must be brought before us"]]]
