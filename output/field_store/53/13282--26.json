ESCENA II                               SCENE II    (Doña Inés, Brígida)                    (Doña Inés, Brígida)    DOÑA INÉS: Dios mío, ¡cuánto he         Good Lord, how I have dreamed!  soñado!  Loca estoy: ¿qué hora será?             I must be mad. What time can it be?  Pero ¿qué es esto?, ¡ay de mí!          But what is this? Ay de mi!  No recuerdo que jamás                   I don't recall that I have ever  haya visto este aposento.               seen this room.  ¿Quién me trajo aquí?                   Who brought me here?    BRÍGIDA: Don Juan.                      Don Juan.    DOÑA INÉS:  Siempre don Juan. Mas conmigo           Always Don Juan. But you  aquí tú también estás,                  are here with me too,  Brígida?                                Brigida.    BRÍGIDA: Sí, doña Inés.                 Yes, Doña Inés.    DOÑA INÉS: Pero dime, en caridad,       But tell me for pity's sake,  ¿dónde estamos? ¿Este cuarto            where are we? This room,  es del convento?                        does it belong to the convent?    BRÍGIDA: No tal:                        Not at all:  aquello era un cuchitril                that was a hovel  en donde no había más                   in which there was nothing but  que miseria.                            misery.    DOÑA INÉS: Pero en fin                  But then,  ¿en dónde estamos?                      where are we?    BRÍGIDA: Mirad,                         Look,  mirad por este balcón,                  look from this balcony,  y alcanzaréis lo que va                 and you will see how far  desde un convento de monjas             a convent of nuns is from  a una quinta de don Juan.               the estate of Don Juan.    DOÑA INÉS: ¿Es de don Juan esta         This estate belongs to Don Juan?  quinta?    BRÍGIDA: Y creo que vuestra ya.         And I think it is yours now.    DOÑA INÉS: Pero no comprendo,           I don't understand Brigida  Brigida,  lo que me hablas.                       what are you talking about?    BRÍGIDA: Escuchad.                      Listen.  Estabais en el convento                 You were reading with delight  leyendo con mucho afán                  in the convent, in your hand  una carta de don Juan,                  a letter from don Juan,  cuando estalló en un momento            when suddenly in the night  un incendio formidable.                 a terrible fire broke out there.    DOÑA INÉS: ¡Jesús!                      Merciful heavens!    BRÍGIDA: Espantoso, inmenso;            Terrifying, immense:  el humo era ya tan denso                the smoke itself was so dense  que el aire se hizo palpable.           you could almost touch the air.    DOÑA INÉS: Pues no recuerdo...          But I don't remember.    BRÍGIDA: Las dos                        Well we two  con la carta entretenidas,              were so engrossed with our reading  olvidamos nuestras vidas,               oblivious, forgetful, of                                          everything,  yo oyendo y leyendo vos.                you speaking, I listening to you.  Y estaba, en verdad, tan tierna,        And it was so tender I know,  que entrambas a su lectura              that we both ascribed  achacamos la tortura                    the torment we felt inside  que sentíamos interna.                  to reading it so.  Apenas ya respirar                      We could scarcely find breath  podíamos, y las llamas                  and the flames, as I said,  prendían ya en nuestras camas:          had already consumed our beds:  nos íbamos a asfixiar                   we were facing certain death  cuando don Juan, que os adora           when Don Juan, who you'll find  que rondaba el convento,                adores you, circling the wall,  al ver crecer con el viento             seeing the flames so tall  la llama devastadora,                   increasing with the wind  con inaudito valor,                     with unheard of courage,  viendo que ibais a abrasaros,           seeing you were going to die  se metió para salvaros                  undertook to save you, by  por donde pudo mejor.                   the best way he could manage.  Vos al verle así asaltar                You, upon seeing him try  la celda tan de improviso,              your cell door suddenly  os desmayasteis..., preciso;            fainted. Oh, of necessity:  la cosa era de esperar.                 it was to be expected. Why,  Y él, cuando os vio caer así,           he, when he saw you fall  en sus brazos os tomó                   took you in his arms  y echó a huir; yo le seguí,             and fled. I followed his call,  y del fuego nos sacó.                   and he got us away from harm.  ¿Dónde vamos a esta hora?               Where to go at that hour of night?  Vos seguíais desmayada,                 You still in a faint,  yo estaba ya casi ahogada.              I my throat in such constraint.  Dijo, pues: \"Hasta la aurora            He said then, \"Till morning light  en mi casa las tendré\".                 I'll protect them here at my house.\"  Y henos, doña Inés, aquí.               And that's why we're here Inés.    DOÑA INÉS: ¿Conque ésta es su casa?     So this is his house?    BRÍGIDA: Sí.                            Yes.    DOÑA INÉS: Pues nada recuerdo, a fe.    I remember nothing. His house!  Pero... ¡en su casa...! ¡Oh! Al         Oh! Quickly. Oh!  punto  salgamos de ella..., yo tengo           Lets leave here...I  can go  la de mi padre.                         to my father's house.    BRÍGIDA: Convengo                       Of course,  con vos; pero es el asunto...           but the fact is, you know.....    DOÑA INÉS: ¿Qué?                        What?    BRÍGIDA: Que no podemos ir.             We can't go there.    DOÑA INÉS: Oir tal me maravilla.        I am amazed to hear it. We will.    BRÍGIDA: Nos aparta de Sevilla...       But we're separated from                                          Seville....    DOÑA INÉS: ¿Quién?                      By what?    BRÍGIDA: Vedlo, el Guadalquivir.        See. The Guadalquivir.    DOÑA INÉS: ¿No estamos en la ciudad?    Then we're not in the city?    BRÍGIDA: A una legua nos hallamos       We find ourselves a mile  de sus murallas.                        from its walls.    DOÑA INÉS: ¡Oh! ¡Estamos                Oh! Then I'll  perdidas!                               be lost!    BRÍGIDA: ¿No sé en verdad               I don't see truly  por qué?                                why?    DOÑA INÉS: Me estás confundiendo,       You're confusing me,  Brígida..., y no sé qué redes           Brigida, and I don't know what nets  son las que entre estas paredes         these are I fear you stretch  temo que me estás tendiendo.            around the walls and me.  Nunca el claustro abandoné              I don't know the world, indeed  ni sé del mundo exterior                I have never left the cloister,  los usos; mas tengo honor,              but I'm noble, Brigida: I have honour,  noble soy, Brígida, y sé                and I know, by every creed,  que la casa de don Juan                 that Don Juan's house for me  no es buen sitio para mí:               is no good place to be:  me lo está diciendo aquí                I don't know what I foresee  no sé qué escondido afán.               warning me of this so clearly.  Ven, huyamos.                           Come, lets leave.    BRÍGIDA: Doña Inés,                     Doña Inés,  la existencia os ha salvado.            he preserved your very existence!    DOÑA INÉS: Sí, pero me ha envenenado    Yes, but his poison insists on  el corazón.                             piercing my heart.    BRÍGIDA: ¿Le amáis, pues?               You love him to excess?    DOÑA INÉS: No sé... Mas, por            I don't know, but all the same  compasión,  huyamos pronto de ese hombre,           let us flee quickly from here,  tras de cuyo solo nombre                in my very heart I fear  se me escapa el corazón.                even the sound of his name.  ¡Ah! Tú me diste un papel               You gave me a letter  de mano de ese hombre escrito,          written by that man himself,  y algún encanto maldito                 and some wicked spell  me diste encerrado en él.               caught up in it's paper.  Una sola vez le vi                      I could only see  por entre unas celosías,                him once through a window,  que estaba, me decías,                  for you told me he was also  en aquel sitio por mí.                  in that place because of me.  Tú, Brígida, a todas horas              You Brigida, in every place,  me venías de él a hablar                came to talk to me about him  haciéndome recordar                     making me recall him  sus gracias fascinadoras.               his fascinating grace.  Tú me dijiste que estaba                You told me he was the same  para mí destinado                       one, destined only for me  por mi padre..., y me has jurado        by my father, and swore to me  en su nombre que me amaba.              that he loved me, using his name.  ¿Que le amo, dices?... Pues bien,       Do I love him you ask? Well,  si esto es amar, sí, le amo;            yes I love him, if this is love:  pero yo sé que me infamo                but by that passion I prove  con esa pasión también.                 that I also debase myself.  Y si el débil corazón                   And if my weak heart should stray  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5210"],[0,"The Borough (#19)"],[1,"'ring from your throne;  Then step behind, and all your glory's gone:  Of crown and palace, throne and guards bereft,  The pomp is vanish'd and the care is left.  Yet strong and lively is the joy they feel,  When the full house secures the plenteous meal;  Flatt'ring and flatter'd, each attempts to raise  A brother's merits for a brother's praise:  For never hero shows a prouder heart,  Than he who proudly acts a hero's part;  Nor without cause; the boards, we know, can yield  Place for fierce contest, like the tented field.     Graceful to tread the stage, to be in turn  The prince we honour, and the knave we spurn;  Bravely to bear the tumult of the crowd,  The hiss tremendous, and the censure loud:  These are their parts,--and he who these sustains,  Deserves some praise and profit for his pains.  Heroes at least of gentler kind are they,  Against whose swords no weeping widows pray,  No blood their fury sheds, nor havoc marks their way.     Sad happy race! soon raised and soon depress'd,  Your days all pass'd in jeopardy and jest;  Poor without prudence, with afflictions vain,  Not warn'd by misery, not enrich'd by gain;  Whom Justice, pitying, chides from place to place,  A wandering, careless, wretched, merry race,  Whose cheerful looks assume, and play the parts  Of happy rovers with repining hearts;  Then cast off care, and in the mimic pain  Of tragic woe feel spirits light and vain,  Distress and hope--the mind's the body's wear,  The man's affliction, and the actor's tear:  Alternate times of fasting and excess  Are yours, ye smiling children of distress.     Slaves though ye be, your wandering freedom seems,  And with your varying views and restless schemes,  Your griefs are transient, as your joys are dreams.     Yet keen those griefs--ah! what avail thy charms,  Fair Juliet! what that infant in thine arms;  What those heroic lines thy patience learns,  What all the aid thy present Romeo earns,  Whilst thou art crowded in that lumbering wain  With all thy plaintive sisters to complain?     Nor is there lack of labour--To rehearse,  Day after day, poor scraps of prose and verse;  To bear each other's spirit, pride, and spite;  To hide in rant the heart ache of the night;  To dress in gaudy patchwork, and to force  The mind to think on the appointed course; -  This is laborious, and may be defined  The bootless labour of the thriftless mind.     There is a veteran Dame:  I see her stand  Intent and pensive with her book in hand;  Awhile her thoughts she forces on her part,  Then dwells on objects nearer to the heart;  Across the room she paces, gets her tone,  And fits her features for the Danish throne;  To-night a queen--I mark her motion slow,  I hear her speech, and Hamlet's mother know.     Methinks 'tis pitiful to see her try  For strength of arms and energy of eye;  With vigour lost, and spirits worn away,  Her pomp and pride she labours to display;  And when awhile she's tried her part to act,  To find her thoughts arrested by some fact;  When struggles more and more severe are seen,  In the plain actress than the Danish queen, -  At length she feels her part, she finds delight,  And fancies all the plaudits of the night;  Old as she is, she smiles at every speech,  And thinks no youthful part beyond her reach,  But as the mist of vanity again  Is blown away, by press of present pain,  Sad and in doubt she to her purse applies  For cause of comfort, where no comfort lies;  Then to her task she sighing turns again -  \"Oh! Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!\"     And who that poor, consumptive, wither'd thing,  Who strains her slender throat and strives to sing?  Panting for breath and forced her voice to drop,  And far unlike the inmate of the shop,  Where she, in youth and health, alert and gay,  Laugh'd off at night the labours of the day;  With novels, verses, fancy's fertile powers,  And sister-converse pass'd the evening hours:  But Cynthia's soul was soft, her wishes strong,  Her judgment weak, and her conclusions wrong;  The morning-call and counter were her dread,  And her contempt the needle and the thread:  But when she read a gentle damsel's part,  Her woe, her wish! she had them all by heart.     At length the hero of the boards drew nigh,  Who spake of love till sigh re-echo'd sigh;  He told in honey'd words his deathless flame,  And she his own by tender vows became;  Nor ring nor licence needed souls so fond,  Alfonso's passion was his Cynthia's bond:  And thus the simple girl, to shame betray'd,  Sinks to the grave forsaken and dismay'd.     Sick without pity, sorrowing without hope,  See her! the grief and scandal of the troop;  A wretched martyr to a childish pride,  Her woe insulted, and her praise denied:  Her humble talents, though derided, used,  Her prospects lost, her confidence abused;  All that remains--for she not long can brave  Increase of evils--is an early grave.     Ye gentle Cynthias of the shop, take heed  What dreams you cherish, and what books ye read!     A decent sum had Peter Nottage made,  By joining bricks--to him a thriving trade:  Of his employment master and his wife,  This humble tradesman led a lordly life;  The house of kings and heroes lack'd repairs,  And Peter, though reluctant, served the Players:  Connected thus, he heard in way polite, -  \"Come, Master Nottage, see us play to night,\"  At first 'twas folly, nonsense, idle stuff,  But seen for nothing it grew well enough;  And better now--now best, and every night,  In this fool's paradise he drank delight;  And as he felt the bliss, he wish'd to know  Whence all this rapture and these joys could flow;  For if the seeing could such pleasure bring,  What must the feeling?--feeling like a king?     In vain his wife, his uncle, and his friend,  Cried--\"Peter! Peter! let such follies end;  'Tis well enough these vagabonds to see,  But would you partner with a showman be?\"     \"Showman!\" said Peter, \"did not Quin and Clive,  And Roscius-Garrick, by the science thrive?  Showman!--'tis scandal; I'm by genius led  To join a class who've Shakspeare at their head.\"     Poor Peter thus by easy steps became  A dreaming candidate for scenic fame,  And, after years consumed, infirm and poor,  He sits and takes the tickets at the door.     Of various men these marching troops are made, -  Pen-spurning clerks, and lads contemning trade;  Waiters and servants by confinement teased,  And youths of wealth by dissipation eased;  With feeling nymphs, who, such resource at hand,  Scorn to obey the rigour of command;  Some, who from higher views by vice are won,  And some of either sex by love undone;  The greater part lamenting as their fall,  What some an honour and advancement call.     There are who names in shame or fear assume,  And hence our Bevilles and our Savilles come;  It honours him, from tailor's board kick'd down,  As Mister Dormer to amuse the town;  Falling, he rises:  but a kind there are  Who dwell on former prospects, and despair;  Justly but vainly they their fate deplore,  And mourn their fall, who fell to rise no more.     Our merchant Thompson, with his sons around,  Most mind and talent in his Frederick found:  He was so lively, that his mother knew,  If he were taught, that honour must ensue;  The father's views were in a different line, -  But if at college he were sure to shine.  Then should he go--to prosper who could doubt?  When schoolboy stigmas would be all wash'd out,  For there were marks upon his youthful face,  'Twixt vice and error--a neglected case -  These would submit to skill; a little time,  And none could trace the error or the crime;  Then let him go, and once at college, he  Might choose his station--what would Frederick be.     'Twas soon determined--He could not descend  To pedant-laws and lectures without end;  And then the chapel--night and morn to pray,  Or mulct and threaten'd if he kept away;  No! not to be a bishop--so he swore,  And at his college he was seen no more.     His debts all paid, the father, with a sigh,  Placed him in office--\"Do, my Frederick, try:  Confine thyself a few short months and then -\"  He tried a fortnight, and threw down the pen.  Again demands were hush'd:  \"My son, you're free,  But you're unsettled; take your chance at sea:\"  So in few days the midshipman, equipp'd  Received the mother's blessing, and was shipp'd.     Hard was her fortune! soon compell'd to meet  The wretched stripling staggering through the street;  For, rash, impetuous, insolent, and vain,  The Captain sent him to his friends again:  About the Borough roved th' unnappy boy,  And ate the bread of every chance-employ!  Of friends he borrow'd, and the parents yet  In secret fondness authorized the debt;  The younger sister, still a child, was taught  To give with feign'd affright the pittance sought;  For now the father cried--\"It is too late  For trial more--I leave him to his fate,\" -  Yet left him not:  and with a kind of joy,  The mother heard of her desponding boy;  At length he sicken'd, and he found, when sick,  All aid was ready, all attendance quick;  A fever seized him, and at once was lost  The thought of trespass, error, crime, and cost:  Th' indulgent parents, knelt beside the youth,  They heard his promise and believed his truth;  And when the danger lessen'd on their view,  They cast off doubt, and hope assurance grew; -  Nursed by his sisters, cherish'd by his sire,  Begg'd to be glad, encouraged to aspire,  His life, they said, would now all care repay,  And he might date his prospects from that day;  A son, a brother to his home received,  They hoped for all things, and in all believed.     And now will pardon, comfort, kindness draw  The youth from vice? will honour, duty, law?  Alas! not all:  the more the trials lent,  The less he seem'd to ponder and repent;  Headstrong, determined in his own career,  He thought reproof unjust and truth severe;  The soul's disease was to its crisis come,  He first abused and then abjured his home;  And"]]]
