But Catherine did not wince. Her fixed eyes were full  of thought.    \"It was all that here,\" she said. \"One depressing morning I had a  telegram from Bob, 'Spion Kop taken'--\"    \"So Bob,\" I nodded, \"had it as badly as everybody else!\"    \"Worse,\" declared Catherine, her eye hardening; \"it was all I could do  to keep him at Cambridge, though he had only just gone up. He would have  given up everything and flown to the Front if I had let him.\"    And she wore the inexorable face with which I could picture her standing  in his way; and in Catherine I could admire that dogged look and all it  spelt, because a great passion is always admirable. The passion of  Catherine's life was her boy, the only son of his mother, and she a  widow. It had been so when he was quite small, as I remembered it with a  pinch of jealousy startling as a twinge from an old wound. More than  ever must it be so now; that was as natural as the maternal embargo in  which Catherine seemed almost to glory. And yet, I reflected, if all the  widows had thought only of their only sons--and of themselves!    \"The next depressing morning,\" continued Catherine, happily oblivious of  what was passing through one's mind, \"the first thing I saw, the first  time I put my nose outside, was a great pink placard with 'Spion Kop  Abandoned!' Duncan, it was too awful.\"    \"I wish we'd sat tight,\" I said, \"I must confess.\"    \"Tight!\" cried Catherine in dry horror. \"I should have abandoned it long  before. I should have run away--hard! To think that you didn't--that's  quite enough for me.\"    And again I sustained the full flattery of that speechless awe which was  yet unembarrassing by reason of its freedom from undue solemnity.    \"There were some of us who hadn't a leg to run on,\" I had to say; \"I was  one, Mrs. Evers.\"    \"I beg your pardon?\"    \"Catherine, then.\" But it put me to the blush.    \"Thank you. If you really wish me to call you 'Captain Clephane' you  have only to say so; but in that case I can't ask the favour I had made  up my mind to ask--of so old a friend.\"    Her most winning voice was as good a servant as ever; the touch of scorn  in it was enough to stimulate, but not to sting; and it was the same  with the sudden light in the steady intellectual eyes.    \"Catherine,\" I said, \"you can't indeed ask any favour of me! There you  are quite right. It is not a word to use between us.\"    Mrs. Evers gave me one of her deliberate looks before replying.    \"And I am not so sure that it is a favour,\" she said softly enough at  last. \"It is really your advice I want to ask, in the first place at all  events. Duncan, it's about old Bob!\"    The corners of her mouth twitched, her eyes filled with a quaint  humorous concern, and as a preamble I was handed the photograph which I  had already studied on my own account.    \"Isn't he a dear?\" asked Bob's mother. \"Would you have known him,  Duncan?\"    \"I did know him,\" said I. \"Spotted him at a glance. He's the same old  Bob all over.\"    I was fortunate enough to meet the swift glance I got for that, for in  sheer sweetness and affection it outdid all remembered glances of the  past. In a moment it was as though I had more than regained the lost  ground of lost years. And in another moment, on the heels of the  discovery, came the still more startling one that I was glad to have  regained my ground, was thankful to be reinstated, and strangely,  acutely, yet uneasily happy, as I had never been since the old days in  this very room.    Half in a dream I heard Catherine telling of her boy, of his Eton  triumphs, how he had been one of the rackets pair two years, and in the  eleven his last, but \"in Pop\" before he was seventeen, and yet as simple  and unaffected and unspoilt with it all as the small boy whom I  remembered. And I did remember him, and knew his mother well enough to  believe it all; for she did not chant his praises to organ music, but  rather hummed them to the banjo; and one felt that her own demure  humour, so signal and so permanent a charm in Catherine, would have been  the saving of half-a-dozen Bobs.    \"And yet,\" she wound up at her starting-point, \"it's about poor old Bob  I want to speak to you!\"    \"Not in a fix, I hope?\"    \"I hope not, Duncan.\"    Catherine was serious now.    \"Or mischief?\"    \"That depends on what you mean by mischief.\"    Catherine was more serious still.    \"Well, there are several brands, but only one or two that really  poison--unless, of course, a man is very poor.\"    And my mind harked back to its first suspicion, of some financial  embarrassment, now conceivable enough; but Catherine told me her boy was  not poor, with the air of one who would have drunk ditchwater rather  than let the other want for champagne.    \"It is just the opposite,\" she added: \"in little more than a year, when  he comes of age, he will have quite as much as is good for him. You know  what he is, or rather you don't. I do. And if I were not his mother I  should fall in love with him myself!\"    Catherine looked down on me as she returned from replacing Bob's  photograph on the mantelpiece. The humour had gone out of her eye; in  its place was an almost animal glitter, a far harder light than had  accompanied the significant reference to the patriotic impulse which she  had nipped in the bud. It was probably only the old, old look of the  lioness whose whelp is threatened, but it was something new to me in  Catherine Evers, something half-repellent and yet almost wholly fine.    \"You don't mean to say it's that?\" I asked aghast.    \"No, I don't,\" Catherine answered, with a hard little laugh. \"He's not  quite twenty, remember; but I am afraid that he is making a fool of  himself, and I want it stopped.\"    I waited for more, merely venturing to nod my sympathetic concern.    \"Poor old Bob, as you may suppose, is not a genius. He is far too nice,\"  declared Catherine's old self, \"to be anything so nasty. But I always  thought he had his head screwed on, and his heart screwed in, or I never  would have let him loose in a Swiss hotel. As it was, I was only too  glad for him to go with George Kennerley, who was as good at work at  Eton as Bob was at games.\"    In Catherine's tone, for all the books on her shelves, the pictures on  her walls, there was no doubt at all as to which of the two an Eton boy  should be good at, and I agreed sincerely with another nod.    \"They were to read together for an hour or so every day. I thought it  would be a nice little change for Bob, and it was quite a chance; he  must do a certain amount of work, you see. Well, they only went at the  beginning of the month, and already they have had enough of each other's  society.\"    \"You don't mean that they've had a row?\"    Catherine inclined a mortified head.    \"Bob never had such a thing in his life before, nor did I ever know  anybody who succeeded in having one with Bob. It does take two, you  know. And when one of the two has an angelic temper, and tact enough for  twenty--\"    \"You naturally blame the other,\" I put in, as she paused in visible  perplexity.    \"But I don't, Duncan, and that's just the point. George is devoted to  Bob, and is as nice as he can be himself, in his own sober, honest,  plodding way. He may not have the temper, he certainly has not the tact,  but he worships Bob and has come back quite miserable.\"    \"Then he has come back, and you have seen him?\"    \"He was here last night. You must know that Bob writes to me every day,  even from Cambridge, if it's only a line; and in yesterday's letter he  mentioned quite casually that George had had enough of it and was off  home. It was a little too casual to be quite natural in old Bob, and  there are other things he has been mentioning in the same way. If any  instinct is to be relied upon it is a mother's, and mine amounted almost  to second sight. I sent Master George a telegram, and he came in last  night.\"    \"Well?\"'    \"Not a word! There was bad blood between them, but that was all I could  get out of him. Vulgar disagreeables between Bob, of all people, and his  greatest friend! If you could have seen the poor fellow sitting where  you are sitting now, like a prisoner in the dock! I put him in the  witness-box instead, and examined him on scraps of Bob's letters to me.  It was as unscrupulous as you please, but I felt unscrupulous; and the  poor dear was too loyal to admit, yet too honest to deny, a single  thing.\"    \"And?\" said I, as Bob's mother paused again.    \"And,\" cried she, with conscious melodrama in the fiery twinkle of her  eye--\"and, I know all! There is an odious creature at the hotel--a  widow, if you please! A 'ripping widow' Bob called her in his first  letter; then it was 'Mrs. Lascelles'; but now it is only 'some people'  whom he escorts here, there, and everywhere. _Some_ people, indeed!\"    Catherine smiled unmercifully. I relied upon my nod.    \"I needn't tell you,\" she went on, \"that the creature is at least twenty  years older than my baby, and not at all nice at that. George didn't  tell me, mind, but he couldn't deny a single thing. It was about her  that they fell out. Poor George remonstrated, not too diplomatically, I  daresay, but I can quite see that my Bob behaved as he was never known  to behave on land or sea. The poor child has been bewitched, neither  more nor less.\"    \"He'll get over it,\" I murmured, with the somewhat shaky confidence born  of my own experience.    Catherine looked at me in mild surprise.    \"But it's "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11171"],[0,"Uncle Tom's Cabin, Young Folks' Edition (#2)"],[1,"his wife and dear little children, never to see  them any more.    'Aunt Chloe,' said Eliza, in a minute or two, 'I must go. I saw my  husband to-day. He told me he meant to run away soon, because his master  is so cruel to him. Try to send him a message from me. Tell him I have  run away to save our boy. Tell him to come after me if he can. Good-bye,  good-bye. God bless you!'    Then Eliza went out again into the dark night with her little boy in her  arms, and Aunt Chloe shut the door softly behind her.          CHAPTER III      THE MORNING AFTER      Next morning, when it was discovered that Eliza had run away with her  little boy, there was great excitement and confusion all over the house.    Mrs. Shelby was very glad. 'Thank God!' she said. 'I hope Eliza will get  right away. I could not bear to think of Harry being sold to that cruel  man.'    Mr. Shelby was angry. 'Haley knew I didn't want to sell the child,' he  said. 'He will blame me for this.'    One person only was quite silent, and that was Aunt Chloe. She went on,  making the breakfast as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement  round her.    All the little black boys belonging to the house thought it was fine  fun. Very soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many  crows, on the railings, waiting for Haley to come. They wanted to see  how angry he would be, when he heard the news.    And he was dreadfully angry. The little nigger boys thought it was  grand. They shouted and laughed and made faces at him to their hearts'  content.    At last Haley became so angry, that Mr. Shelby offered to give him two  men to help him to find Eliza.    But these two men, Sam and Andy, knew quite well that Mrs. Shelby did  not want Eliza to be caught, so they put off as much time as they could.    They let loose their horses and Haley's too. Then they frightened and  chased them, till they raced like mad things all over the great lawns  which surrounded the house.    Whenever it seemed likely that a horse would be caught, Sam ran up,  waving his hat and shouting wildly, 'Now for it! Cotch him! Cotch him!'  This frightened the horses so much that they galloped off faster than  before.    Haley rushed up and down, shouting and using dreadful, naughty words,  and stamping with rage all the time.    At last, about twelve o'clock, Sam came riding up with Haley's horse.  'He's cotched,' he said, seemingly very proud of himself. 'I cotched  him!'    Of course, now it was too late to start before dinner. Besides, the  horses were so tired with all their running about, that they had to have  a rest.    When at last they did start, Sam led them by a wrong road. So the sun  was almost setting before they arrived at the village where Haley hoped  to find Eliza.          CHAPTER IV      THE CHASE      When Eliza left Uncle Tom's cabin, she felt very sad and lonely. She  knew she was leaving all the friends she had ever had behind her.    At first Harry was frightened. Soon he grew sleepy. 'Mother, I don't  need to keep awake, do I?' he said.    'No, my darling, sleep, if you want to.'    'But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won't let the bad man take me?'    'No!'    'You're sure, an't you, mother?'    'Yes, sure.'    [Illustration]    Harry dropped his little weary head upon her shoulder, and was soon  fast asleep.    Eliza walked on and on, never resting, all through the night. When the  sun rose, she was many miles away from her old home. Still she walked  on, only stopping, in the middle of the day, to buy a little dinner for  herself and Harry at a farm-house.    At last, when it was nearly dark, she arrived at a village, on the banks  of the river Ohio. If she could only get across that river, Eliza felt  she would be safe.    She went to a little inn on the bank, where a kind-looking woman was  busy cooking supper.    'Is there a boat that takes people across the river now?' she asked.    'No, indeed,' replied the woman. 'The boats has stopped running. It  isn't safe, there be too many blocks of ice floating about.'    Eliza looked so sad and disappointed when she heard this, that the good  woman was sorry for her. Harry too was so tired, that he began to cry.    [Illustration]    'Here, take him into this room,' said the woman, opening the door into a  small bed-room.    Eliza laid her tired little boy upon the bed, and he soon fell fast  asleep. But for her there was no rest. She stood at the window, watching  the river with its great floating blocks of ice, wondering how she could  cross it.    As she stood there she heard a shout. Looking up she saw Sam. She drew  back just in time, for Haley and Andy were riding only a yard or two  behind him.    It was a dreadful moment for Eliza. Her room opened by a side door to  the river. She seized her child and sprang down the steps towards it.    Haley caught sight of her as she disappeared down the bank. Throwing  himself from his horse, and calling loudly to Sam and Andy, he was after  her in a moment.    In that terrible moment her feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground.  The next, she was at the water's edge.    On they came behind her. With one wild cry and flying leap, she jumped  right over the water by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond. It was  a desperate leap. Haley, Sam, and Andy cried out, and lifted up their  hands in astonishment.    The great piece of ice pitched and creaked as her weight came upon it.  But she stayed there not a moment. With wild cries she leaped to another  and still another--stumbling--leaping--slipping--springing up again!    Her shoes were gone, her stockings cut from her feet by the sharp edges  of the ice. Blood marked every step. But she knew nothing, felt nothing,  till dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her  up the bank.    'Yer a brave gal, now, whoever ye are!' said the man.    'Oh, save me--do save me--do hide me,' she cried.    'Why, what's the matter?' asked the man.    'My child! this boy--mas'r sold him. There's his new mas'r,' she said,  pointing to the other shore. 'Oh, save me.'    'Yer a right brave gal,' said the man. 'Go there,' pointing to a big  white house close by. 'They are kind folks; they'll help you.'    'Oh, thank you, thank you,' said Eliza, as she walked quickly away. The  man stood and looked after her wonderingly.    On the other side of the river Haley was standing perfectly amazed at  the scene. When Eliza disappeared over the bank he turned and looked at  Sam and Andy, with terrible anger in his eyes.    But Sam and Andy were glad, oh, so glad, that Eliza had escaped. They  were so glad that they laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks.    'I'll make ye laugh,' said Haley, laying about their heads with his  riding whip.    They ducked their heads, ran shouting up the bank, and were on their  horses before he could reach them.    'Good evening, mas'r,' said Sam. 'I berry much 'spect missis be anxious  'bout us. Mas'r Haley won't want us no longer.' Then off they went as  fast as their horses could gallop.    It was late at night before they reached home again, but Mrs. Shelby was  waiting for them. As soon as she heard the horses galloping up she ran  out to the balcony.    'Is that you, Sam?' she called. 'Where are they?'    'Mas'r Haley's a-restin' at the tavern. He's drefful fatigued, missis.'    'And Eliza, Sam?'    'Come up here, Sam,' called Mr. Shelby, who had followed his wife, 'and  tell your mistress what she wants to know.'    So Sam went up and told the wonderful story of how Eliza had crossed the  river on the floating ice. Mr. and Mrs. Shelby found it hard to believe  that such a thing was possible.    Mrs. Shelby was very, very glad that Eliza had escaped. She told Aunt  Chloe to give Sam and Andy a specially good supper. Then they went to  bed quite pleased with their day's work.          CHAPTER V      ELIZA FINDS A REFUGE      A lady and gentleman were sitting talking happily together in the  drawing-room of the white house to which Eliza had gone. Suddenly their  old black man-of-all-work put his head in at the door and said, 'Will  missis come into the kitchen?'    The lady went. Presently she called to her husband, 'I do wish you would  come here a moment.'    He rose and went into the kitchen.    There lay Eliza on two kitchen chairs. Her poor feet were all cut and  bleeding, and she had fainted quite away. The master of the house drew  his breath short, and stood silent.    [Illustration]    His wife and the cook were trying to bring Eliza round. The old  man had Harry on his knee, and was busy pulling off his shoes and  stockings, to warm the little cold feet.    'Poor creature,' said the lady.    Suddenly Eliza opened her eyes. A dreadful look of pain came into her  face. She sprang up saying, 'Oh, my Harry, have they got him?'    As soon as he heard her voice, Harry jumped from the old man's knee, and  running to her side, put up his arms.    'Oh, he's here! he's here,' she said, kissing him. 'Oh, ma'am,' she  went, on turning wildly to the lady of the house, 'do protect us, don't  let them get him.'    'Nobody shall hurt you here, poor woman,' said the lady. 'You are safe;  don't be afraid.'    'God bless you,' said Eliza, covering her face and sobbing, while Harry,  seeing her crying, tried to get into her lap to comfort her.    'You needn't be afraid of anything; we are friends here, poor woman.  Tell me where you come from and what you want,' said the lady.    'I came from the other side of the river,' said Eliza.    'When?' said the gentleman, very much astonished.    'To-night.'    'How did you come?'    'I crossed on the ice.'    'Crossed on the ice!' exclaimed every one.    'Yes,' said Eliza slowly, 'I did. God helped me, and I crossed on the  ice. They were close behind me--right behind, and there was no other  way.'    'Law, missis,' said the old servant, 'the ice is all in broken up  blocks, a-swinging up and down in the water.'    'I know it"]]]
