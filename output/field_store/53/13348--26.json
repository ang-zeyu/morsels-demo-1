It has been willed  otherwise, wife. Within twenty-four hours of my taking that oath  I was struck down and my fighting powers were gone forever.    \"My oath was not accepted. I was not to be an instrument of  God's vengeance upon these murderers. Now, our son, without word  or consultation with me, feels called upon to take up the work I  cannot perform. It happens strangely that he can for the next two  or three years be well spared from his life at sea. That the boy  will do great feats I do not suppose; but he is cool and courageous,  for I marked his demeanour under fire the other day. And it may  be that though he may do no great things in fighting he may be  the means in saving some woman, some child, from the fury of the  Spaniards. If he saved but one, the next three years of his life  will not have been misspent.\"    \"But he may fall--he may be killed by the Spaniards!\" Mistress  Martin said in great agitation.    \"If it be the will of God, wife, not otherwise. He is exposed to  danger every time he goes to sea. More than once since he first  came on board, the Venture has been in dire peril; who can say that  her next voyage may not be her last. However, I decide nothing now;  tomorrow I will speak to the boy myself and gather from his words  whether this is a mere passing fancy, natural enough to his age and  to the times, or a deep longing to venture his life in the cause  of a persecuted people whose blood runs in his veins, and who have  a faith which is his own and ours.\"    Mrs. Martin said no more; her husband's will had, since she married,  been in all matters of importance law to her, and was more so than  ever now that he lay weak and helpless. His words and manner too  had much impressed her. Her whole sympathies were passionately with  her countrymen, and the heavy losses she had so recently sustained  had added vastly to her hatred of the Spaniards. The suggestion,  too, of her husband that though Ned might do no great deeds as a  soldier he might be the means of saving some woman or child's life,  appealed to her womanly feelings.    She had girls of her own, and the thought that one of like age  might possibly be saved from the horrors of the sack of a city by  Ned's assistance appealed to her with great force. She went about  the house for the rest of the day subdued and quiet. Ned was puzzled  at her demeanour, and had he not seen for himself that his father  was progressing satisfactorily he would have thought that some  relapse had taken place, some unfavourable symptom appeared. But  this was clearly not the reason, and he could only fancy that now  his mother's anxiety as to his father's state was in some degree  abating, she was beginning to feel the loss of her father and  brothers all the more.    That the request she had promised to make in his name to his father  had anything to do with the matter did not enter his mind. Indeed,  he had begun to regret that he had made it. Not that his intense  longing to take service against the Spaniards was in any way abated,  but he felt it was selfish, now that he might for the first time  be of real use to his parents, for him thus to propose to embark  in adventures on his own account. He had asked his mother to put  the matter before his father, but he had scarce even a hope the  latter would for a moment listen to the proposal. The next morning  after breakfast, as he was about to start for a stroll to the wharf  to have a talk with Peters, his mother said to him quietly: \"Put  aside your cap, Ned, your father wishes to speak to you.\"    She spoke so gravely that Ned ascended the stairs in some perturbation  of spirit. Doubtless she had spoken to his father, and the latter  was about to rate him severely for his folly in proposing to  desert his duty, and to embark in so wild an adventure as that he  had proposed. He was in no way reassured by the grave tone in which  his father said:    \"Place that chair by my bedside, Ned, and sit down; my voice is  not strong and it fatigues me to speak loud. And now,\" he went on,  when Ned with a shamefaced expression had seated himself by the  bedside, \"this desire that your mother tells me of to fight against  the Spaniards for a time in the service of the Prince of Orange,  how did it first come to you?\"    \"Ever since I heard the terrible story of the persecutions here,\"  Ned replied. \"I said to myself then that when I came to be a man I  would take revenge for these horrible murders. Since then the more  I have heard of the persecutions that the people here have suffered  in the cause of their religion, the more I have longed to be able  to give them such aid as I could. I have spoken of it over and over  again to my sisters; but I do not think that I should ever have  ventured to put my desire into words, had it not been for the  terrible news we learnt at Vordwyk. Now, however, that they have  killed my grandfather and uncles and have wounded you, I long more  than ever to join the patriots here; and of course the knowledge  that many young Englishmen were coming out to Brill and Flushing  as volunteers added to my desire. I said to myself if they who are  English are ready to give their lives in the cause of the Hollanders,  why should not I, who speak their language and am of their blood?\"    \"You have no desire to do great deeds or to distinguish yourself?\"  Captain Martin asked.    \"No, father; I have never so much as thought of that. I could not  imagine that I, as a boy, could be of any great service. I thought  I might, perhaps, being so young, be able to be of use in passing  among the Spaniards and carrying messages where a man could not  get through. I thought sometimes I might perhaps carry a warning  in time to enable women to escape with their children from a town  that was about to be beleaguered, and I hoped that if I did stand  in the ranks to face the Spaniards I should not disgrace my nation  and blood. I know, father, that it was presumptuous for me to think  that I could be of any real use; and if you are against it I will,  of course, as I told my mother, submit myself cheerfully to your  wishes.\"    \"I am glad to see, Ned, that in this matter you are actuated by  right motives, and not moved by any boyish idea of adventure or of  doing feats of valour. This is no ordinary war, my boy. There is  none of the chivalry of past times in the struggle here. It is one  of life and death--grim, earnest, and determined. On one side  is Philip with the hosts of Spain, the greatest power in Europe,  determined to crush out the life of these poor provinces, to stamp  out the religion of the country, to leave not one man, woman, or  child alive who refuses to attend mass and to bow the knee before  the Papist images; on the other side you have a poor people tenanting  a land snatched from the sea, and held by constant and enduring  labour, equally determined that they will not abjure their religion,  that they will not permit the Inquisition to be established among  them, and ready to give lives and homes and all in the cause  of religious liberty. They have no thought of throwing off their  allegiance to Spain, if Spain will but be tolerant. The Prince  of Orange issues his orders and proclamations as the stadtholder  and lieutenant of the king, and declares that he is warring for  Philip, and designs only to repel those who, by their persecution  and cruelty, are dishonouring the royal cause.    \"This cannot go on forever, and in time the Netherlands will be  driven to entreat some other foreign monarch to take them under his  protection. In this war there is no talk of glory. Men are fighting  for their religion, their homes, their wives and families. They  know that the Spaniards show neither quarter nor mercy, and that  it is scarce more than a question between death by the sword and  death by torture and hanging. There is no mercy for prisoners. The  town that yields on good conditions is sacked and destroyed as is  one taken by storm, for in no case have the Spaniards observed the  conditions they have made, deeming oaths taken to heretics to be  in no way binding on their consciences.    \"Thus, Ned, those who embark upon this war engage in a struggle in  which there is no honour nor glory, nor fame nor reward to be won,  but one in which almost certain death stares them in the face, and  which, so far as I can see, can end only in the annihilation of  the people of this country, or in the expulsion of the Spaniards.  I do not say that there is no glory to be gained; but it is not  personal glory. In itself, no cause was ever more glorious than  that of men who struggle, not to conquer territory, not to gather  spoil, not to gratify ambition, but for freedom, for religion, for  hearth and home, and to revenge the countless atrocities inflicted  upon them by their oppressors. After what I have said, do you still  wish to embark upon this struggle?\"    \"I do wish it, father,\" Ned said firmly. \"I desire it above all  things, if you and my mother can spare me.\"    Captain Martin then repeated to Ned the reasons that he had given  his wife for consenting to his carrying out his wishes: the fact  that there was no place for him at present on board the Good Venture,  the oath of vengeance upon the Spaniards that he had taken, and  his impression that although he himself could not carry out that  oath, its weight had been transferred to his son, whose desire to  take up the work he had intended to carry out, just at this moment,  seemed to him to be a special design of Providence.    \"Now Ned,\" he concluded, \"you understand the reasons that sway  me in giving my consent to your desire to do what you can for the  cause of religion and liberty. I do not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#19)"],[1,"letters were finished, she made one more objection.    \"They are certain to call here and make a fuss,\" she said, \"Mr. Asher  and the rest.\"    \"You think they will not bear the blow with manly fortitude?\"    \"I certainly do. And I think it's hard on them, too. Suppose they  depend for a living on what they make from _Peaceful Moments?_\"    \"They don't,\" said Smith reassuringly. \"I've looked into that. Have no  pity for them. They are amateurs--degraded creatures of substance who  take the cocktails out of the mouths of deserving professionals. B.  Henderson Asher, for instance, is largely interested in gents'  haberdashery. And so with the others. We touch their pride, perhaps,  but not their purses.\"    Betty's soft heart was distinctly relieved by the information.    \"I see,\" she said. \"But suppose they do call, what will you do? It will  be very unpleasant.\"    Smith pondered.    \"True,\" he said. \"True. I think you are right there. My nervous system  is so delicately attuned that anything in the shape of a brawl would  reduce it to a frazzle. I think that, for this occasion only, we will  promote Comrade Maloney to the post of editor. He is a stern, hard,  rugged man who does not care how unpopular he is. Yes, I think that  would be best.\"    He signed the letters with a firm hand, \"per pro P. Maloney, editor.\"    Then he lit a cigarette, and leaned back in his chair.    \"An excellent morning's work,\" he said. \"Already I begin to feel the  dawnings of a new self-respect.\"    Betty, thinking the thing over, a little dazed by the rapidity of  Smith's method of action, had found a fresh flaw in the scheme.    \"If you send Mr. Asher and the others away, how are you going to bring  the paper out at all? You can't write it all yourself.\"    Smith looked at her with benevolent admiration.    \"She thinks of everything,\" he murmured. \"That busy brain is never  still. No, Comrade Brown, I do not propose to write the whole paper  myself. I do not shirk work when it gets me in a corner and I can't  side-step, but there are limits. I propose to apply to a few of my late  companions of Park Row, bright boys who will be delighted to come  across with red-hot stuff for a moderate fee.\"    \"And the proprietor of the paper? Won't he make any objection?\"    Smith shook his head with a touch of reproof.    \"You seem determined to try to look on the dark side. Do you insinuate  that we are not acting in the proprietor's best interests? When he gets  his check for the receipts, after I have handled the paper awhile, he  will go singing about the streets. His beaming smile will be a byword.  Visitors will be shown it as one of the sights. His only doubt will be  whether to send his money to the bank or keep it in tubs and roll in  it. And anyway,\" he added, \"he's in Europe somewhere, and never sees  the paper, sensible man.\"    He scratched a speck of dust off his coat-sleeve with his finger nail.    \"This is a big thing,\" he resumed. \"Wait till you see the first number  of the new series. My idea is that _Peaceful Moments_ shall become  a pretty warm proposition. Its tone shall be such that the public will  wonder why we do not print it on asbestos. We shall comment on all the  live events of the week--murders, Wall Street scandals, glove fights,  and the like, in a manner which will make our readers' spines thrill.  Above all, we shall be the guardians of the people's rights. We shall  be a spot light, showing up the dark places and bringing into  prominence those who would endeavor in any way to put the people in  Dutch. We shall detect the wrongdoer, and hand him such a series of  resentful wallops that he will abandon his little games and become a  model citizen. In this way we shall produce a bright, readable little  sheet which will make our city sit up and take notice. I think so. I  think so. And now I must be hustling about and seeing our new  contributors. There is no time to waste.\"          CHAPTER XV    THE HONEYED WORD      The offices of Peaceful Moments were in a large building in a street  off Madison Avenue. They consisted of a sort of outer lair, where Pugsy  Maloney spent his time reading tales of life on the prairies and  heading off undesirable visitors; a small room, into which desirable  but premature visitors were loosed, to wait their turn for admission  into the Presence; and a larger room beyond, which was the editorial  sanctum.    Smith, returning from luncheon on the day following his announcement of  the great change, found both Betty and Pugsy waiting in the outer lair,  evidently with news of import.    \"Mr. Smith,\" began Betty.    \"Dey're in dere,\" said Master Maloney with his customary terseness.    \"Who, exactly?\" asked Smith.    \"De whole bunch of dem.\"    Smith inspected Pugsy through his eyeglass. \"Can you give me any  particulars?\" he asked patiently. \"You are well-meaning, but vague,  Comrade Maloney. Who are in there?\"    \"About 'steen of dem!\" said Pugsy.    \"Mr. Asher,\" said Betty, \"and Mr. Philpotts, and all the rest of them.\"  She struggled for a moment, but, unable to resist the temptation,  added, \"I told you so.\"    A faint smile appeared upon Smith's face.    \"Dey just butted in,\" said Master Maloney, resuming his narrative. \"I  was sittin' here, readin' me book, when de foist of de guys blows in.  'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll go in and  wait,' says he. 'Nuttin' doin',' says I. 'Nix on de goin'-in act.' I  might as well have saved me breat! In he butts. In about t'ree minutes  along comes another gazebo. 'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,'  I says. 'I'll wait,' says he, lightin' out for de door, and in he  butts. Wit' dat I sees de proposition's too fierce for muh. I can't  keep dese big husky guys out if dey bucks center like dat. So when de  rest of de bunch comes along, I don't try to give dem de trun down. I  says, 'Well, gent,' I says, 'it's up to youse. De editor ain't in, but,  if you feels lonesome, push t'roo. Dere's plenty dere to keep youse  company. I can't be boddered!'\"    \"And what more could you have said?\" agreed Smith approvingly. \"Tell  me, did these gentlemen appear to be gay and light-hearted, or did they  seem to be looking for someone with a hatchet?\"    \"Dey was hoppin' mad, de whole bunch of dem.\"    \"Dreadfully,\" attested Betty.    \"As I suspected,\" said Smith, \"but we must not repine. These trifling  contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high journalistic aims. I  fancy that with the aid of the diplomatic smile and the honeyed word I  may manage to win out. Will you come and give me your moral support,  Comrade Brown?\"    He opened the door of the inner room for Betty, and followed her in.    Master Maloney's statement that \"about 'steen\" visitors had arrived  proved to be a little exaggerated. There were five men in the room.    As Smith entered, every eye was turned upon him. To an outside  spectator he would have seemed rather like a very well-dressed Daniel  introduced into a den of singularly irritable lions. Five pairs of eyes  were smoldering with a long-nursed resentment. Five brows were  corrugated with wrathful lines. Such, however, was the simple majesty  of Smith's demeanor that for a moment there was dead silence. Not a  word was spoken as he paced, wrapped in thought, to the editorial  chair. Stillness brooded over the room as he carefully dusted that  piece of furniture, and, having done so to his satisfaction, hitched up  the knees of his trousers and sank gracefully into a sitting position.    This accomplished, he looked up and started. He gazed round the room.    \"Ha! I am observed!\" he murmured.    The words broke the spell. Instantly the five visitors burst  simultaneously into speech.    \"Are you the acting editor of this paper?\"    \"I wish to have a word with you, sir.\"    \"Mr. Maloney, I presume?\"    \"Pardon me!\"    \"I should like a few moments' conversation.\"    The start was good and even, but the gentleman who said \"Pardon me!\"  necessarily finished first, with the rest nowhere.    Smith turned to him, bowed, and fixed him with a benevolent gaze  through his eyeglass.    \"Are you Mr. Maloney, may I ask?\" enquired the favored one.    The others paused for the reply. Smith shook his head. \"My name is  Smith.\"    \"Where is Mr. Maloney?\"    Smith looked across at Betty, who had seated herself in her place by  the typewriter.    \"Where did you tell me Mr. Maloney had gone to, Miss Brown? Ah, well,  never mind. Is there anything _I_ can do for you, gentlemen? I am  on the editorial staff of this paper.\"    \"Then, maybe,\" said a small, round gentleman who, so far, had done only  chorus work, \"you can tell me what all this means? My name is Waterman,  sir. I am here on behalf of my wife, whose name you doubtless know.\"    \"Correct me if I am wrong,\" said Smith, \"but I should say it, also, was  Waterman.\"    \"Luella Granville Waterman, sir!\" said the little man proudly. \"My  wife,\" he went on, \"has received this extraordinary communication from  a man signing himself P. Maloney. We are both at a loss to make head or  tail of it.\"    \"It seems reasonably clear to me,\" said Smith, reading the letter.    \"It's an outrage. My wife has been a contributor to this journal since  its foundation. We are both intimate friends of Mr. Renshaw, to whom my  wife's work has always given complete satisfaction. And now, without  the slightest warning, comes this peremptory dismissal from P. Maloney.  Who is P. Maloney? Where is Mr. Renshaw?\"    The chorus burst forth. It seemed that that was what they all wanted to  know. Who was P. Maloney? Where was Mr. Renshaw?    \"I am the Reverend Edwin T. Philpott, sir,\" said a cadaverous-looking  man with light blue eyes and a melancholy face. \"I have contributed  'Moments of Meditation' to this journal for some considerable time.\"    Smith nodded.    \"I know, yours has always seemed to me work which the world will not  willingly let die.\"    The Reverend Edwin's"]]]
