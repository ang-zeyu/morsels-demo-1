It hath already been set forth in print in a volume written by me  concerning the adventures of King Arthur when he first became king, how  there were certain lesser kings who favored him and were friendly allies  with him, and how there were certain others of the same sort who were his  enemies.    Among those who were his friends was King Ban of Benwick, who was an  exceedingly noble lord of high estate and great honor, and who was of a  lineage so exalted that it is not likely that there was anyone in the world  who was of a higher strain.    [Sidenote: Of King Ban and his misfortunes] Now, upon a certain time, King  Ban of Benwick fell into great trouble; for there came against him a very  powerful enemy, to wit, King Claudas of Scotland. King Claudas brought unto  Benwick a huge army of knights and lords, and these sat down before the  Castle of Trible with intent to take that strong fortress and destroy it.    This noble Castle of Trible was the chiefest and the strongest place of  defence in all King Ban's dominions, wherefore he had intrenched himself  there with all of his knights and with his Queen, hight Helen, and his  youngest son, hight Launcelot.    Now this child, Launcelot, was dearer to Queen Helen than all the world  besides, for he was not only large of limb but so extraordinarily beautiful  of face that I do not believe an angel from Paradise could have been more  beautiful than he. He had been born with a singular birth-mark upon his  shoulder, which birth-mark had the appearance as of a golden star enstamped  upon the skin; wherefore, because of this, the Queen would say: \"Launcelot,  by reason of that star upon thy shoulder I believe that thou shalt be the  star of our house and that thou shalt shine with such remarkable glory that  all the world shall behold thy lustre and shall marvel thereat for all time  to come.\" So the Queen took extraordinary delight in Launcelot and loved  him to the very core of her heart--albeit she knew not, at the time she  spake, how that prophecy of hers concerning the star was to fall so  perfectly true.    Now, though King Ban thought himself very well defended at his Castle of  Trible, yet King Claudas brought so terribly big an army against that place  that it covered the entire plain. A great many battles were fought under  the walls of the castle, but ever King Claudas waxed greater and stronger,  and King Ban's party grew weaker and more fearful.    [Sidenote: King Ban bethinks him of King Arthur] So by and by things came  to such a pass that King Ban bethought him of King Arthur, and he said to  himself: \"I will go to my lord the King and beseech help and aid from him,  for he will certainly give it me. Nor will I trust any messenger in this  affair other than myself; for I myself will go to King Arthur and will  speak to him with my own lips.\"    Having thus bethought him, he sent for Queen Helen to come into his privy  closet and he said to her: \"My dear love, nothing remaineth for me but to  go unto the court of King Arthur and beseech him to lend his powerful aid  in this extremity of our misfortunes; nor will I trust any messenger in  this affair but myself. Now, this castle is no place for thee, when I am  away, therefore, when I go upon this business, I will take thee and  Launcelot with me, and I will leave you both in safety at King Arthur's  court with our other son, Sir Ector, until this war be ended and done.\" And  to these Queen Helen lent her assent.    So King Ban summoned to him the seneschal of the castle, who was named Sir  Malydor le Brun, and said to him: \"Messire, I go hence to-night by a secret  pass, with intent to betake me unto King Arthur, and to beseech his aid in  this extremity. Moreover, I shall take with me my lady and the young child  Launcelot, to place them within the care of King Arthur during these  dolorous wars. But besides these, I will take no other one with me but only  my favorite esquire, Foliot. Now I charge thee, sir, to hold this castle in  my behalf with all thy might and main, and yield it not to our enemies upon  any extremity; for I believe I shall in a little while return with  sufficient aid from King Arthur to compass the relief of this place.\"    [Sidenote: King Ban with Queen Helen and Launcelot escape from Trible] So  when night had fallen very dark and still, King Ban, and Queen Helen, and  the young child Launcelot, and the esquire Foliot left the town privily by  means of a postern gate. Thence they went by a secret path, known only to a  very few, that led down a steep declivity of rocks, with walls of rock upon  either side that were very high indeed, and so they came out in safety  beyond the army of King Claudas and into the forest of the valley below.  And the forest lay very still and solemn and dark in the silence of the  nighttime.    Having thus come out in safety into the forest, that small party journeyed  on with all celerity that they were able to achieve until, some little time  before dawn, they came to where was a lake of water in an open meadow of  the forest. Here they rested for a little while, for Queen Helen had fallen  very weary with the rough and hasty journey which they had traveled.    [Sidenote: Foliot seeth a light] Now whilst they sat there resting, Foliot  spake of a sudden, saying unto King Ban: \"Lord, what is that light that  maketh the sky so bright yonder-ways?\" Then King Ban looked a little and  presently said: \"Methinks it must be the dawn that is breaking.\" \"Lord,\"  quoth Foliot, \"that cannot very well be; for that light in the sky lieth in  the south, whence we have come, and not in the east, where the sun should  arise.\"    Then King Ban's heart misgave him, and his soul was shaken with a great  trouble. \"Foliot,\" he said, \"I believe that you speak sooth and that that  light bodes very ill for us all.\" Then he said: \"Stay here for a little and  I will go and discover what that light may be.\" Therewith he mounted his  horse and rode away in the darkness.    [Sidenote: King Ban beholdeth the burning of Trible] Now there was a very  high hill near-by where they were, and upon the top of the hill was an open  platform of rock whence a man could see a great way off in every direction.  So King Ban went to this place, and, when he had come there, he cast his  eyes in the direction of the light and he straightway beheld with a manner  of terror that the light came from Trible; and then, with that terror still  growing greater at his heart, he beheld that the town and the castle were  all in one great flame of fire.    When King Ban saw this he sat for a while upon his horse like one turned  into a stone. Then, after a while, he cried out in a great voice: \"Woe!  Woe! Woe is me!\" And then he cried out still in a very loud voice, \"Certes,  God hath deserted me entirely.\"    [Sidenote: The death of King Ban] Therewith a great passion of grief took  hold upon him and shook him like to a leaf, and immediately after that he  felt that something brake within him with a very sharp and bitter pain, and  he wist that it was his heart that had broken. So being all alone there  upon the hilltop, and in the perfect stillness of the night, he cried out,  \"My heart! My heart!\" And therewith, the shadows of death coming upon him,  he could not sit any longer upon his horse, but fell down upon the ground.  And he knew very well that death was nigh him, so, having no cross to pray  upon, he took two blades of grass and twisted them into that holy sign, and  he kissed it and prayed unto it that God would forgive him his sins. So he  died all alone upon that hilltop.    Meanwhile, Queen Helen and Foliot sat together waiting for him to return  and presently they heard the sound of his horse's hoofs coming down that  rocky path. Then Queen Helen said: \"Foliot, methinks my lord cometh.\" So in  a little came the horse with the empty saddle. When Foliot beheld that he  said: \"Lady, here meseems is great trouble come to us, for methinks  something hath befallen my lord, and that he is in sore travail, for here  is his horse without him.\"    Then it seemed to Queen Helen as though the spirit of life suddenly went  away from her, for she foresaw what had befallen. So she arose like one in  a dream, and, speaking very quietly, she said: \"Foliot, take me whither my  lord went awhile since!\" To this Foliot said: \"Lady, wait until the  morning, which is near at hand, for it is too dark for you to go  thitherward at this present.\" Whereunto the Lady Helen replied: \"Foliot, I  cannot wait, for if I stay here and wait I believe I shall go mad.\" Upon  this, Foliot did not try to persuade her any more but made ready to take  her whither she would go.    Now the young child Launcelot was then asleep upon the Queen's knees,  wherefore she took her cloak and wrapped the child in it and laid him very  gently upon the ground, so that he did not wake. Then she mounted upon her  palfrey and Foliot led the palfrey up the hill whither King Ban had gone a  short time since.

Oregon is a word derived from the Spanish, and means \"wild thyme,\" the  early explorers finding that herb growing there in great profusion. So  far as we have any record Oregon seems to have been first visited by  white men in 1775; Captain Cook coasted down its shores in 1778. Captain  Gray, commanding the ship \"Columbia,\" of Boston, Mass., discovered the  noble river in 1791, which he named after his ship. Astoria was founded  in 1811; immigration was in full tide in 1839; Territorial organization  was effected in 1848, and Oregon became a State on 14th February, 1859.  It has an area of 96,000 square miles, and is 350 miles long by 275 miles  wide. There are 50,000,000 acres of arable and grazing land, and  10,000,000 acres of forest in the State.    The Union Pacific Railway will sell at greatly reduced rates a series of  excursion tickets called \"Columbia Tours,\" using Portland as a central  point. Stop-over privileges will be given within the limitation of the  tickets.    First Columbia Tour: Portland to \"The Dalles,\" by rail, and return by  river.    Second Columbia Tour: Portland to Astoria, Ilwaco, and Clatsop Beach, and  return by river.    Third Columbia Tour: Portland to Port Townsend, Seattle, and Tacoma by  boat and return.    Fourth Columbia Tour: Portland to Alaska and return.    Fifth Columbia Tour: Portland to San Francisco by boat.    PORTLAND    Is a very beautiful city of 60,000 inhabitants, and situated on the  Willamette river twelve miles from its junction with the Columbia. It is  perhaps true of many of the growing cities of the West, that they do not  offer the same social advantages as the older cities of the East. But  this is principally the case as to what may be called boom cities, where  the larger part of the population is of that floating class which follows  in the line of temporary growth for the purposes of speculation, and in  no sense applies to those centers of trade whose prosperity is based on  the solid foundation of legitimate business. As the metropolis of a  vast section of country, having broad agricultural valleys filled with  improved farms, surrounded by mountains rich in mineral wealth, and  boundless forests of as fine timber as the world produces, the cause  of Portland's growth and prosperity is the trade which it has as the  center of collection and distribution of this great wealth of natural  resources, and it has attracted, not the boomer and speculator, who  find their profits in the wild excitement of the boom, but the  merchant, manufacturer, and investor, who seek the surer if slower  channels of legitimate business and investment. These have come from  the East, most of them within the last few years. They came as seeking  a better and wider field to engage in the same occupations they had  followed in their Eastern homes, and bringing with them all the love of  polite life which they had acquired there, have established here a new  society, equaling in all respects that which they left behind. Here are  as fine churches, as complete a system of schools, as fine residences,  as great a love of music and art, as can be found at any city of the  East of equal size.    [Illustration: PORTLAND, ORE.  On the Union Pacific Ry.]    But while Portland may justly claim to be the peer of any city of its  size in the United States in all that pertains to social life, in the  attractions of beauty of location and surroundings it stands without its  peer. The work of art is but the copy of nature. What the residents of  other cities see but in the copy, or must travel half the world over to  see in the original, the resident of Portland has at his very door.    The city is situate on gently-sloping ground, with, on the one side,  the river, and on the other a range of hills, which, within easy  walking distance, rise to an elevation of a thousand feet above the  river, affording a most picturesque building site. From the very  streets of the thickly settled portion of the city, the Cascade  Mountains, with the snow-capped peaks of Hood, Adams, St. Helens, and  Rainier, are in plain view. As the hills to the west are ascended the  view broadens, until, from the extreme top of some of the higher  points, there is, to the east, the valley stretching away to the  Cascade Mountains, with its rivers, the Columbia and Willamette; in the  foreground Portland, in the middle distance Vancouver, and, bounding  the horizon, the Cascade Mountains, with their snow-clad peaks, and the  gorge of the Columbia in plain sight, whilst away to the north the  course of the Columbia may be followed for miles. To the west, from the  foot of the hills, the valley of the Tualatin stretches away twenty odd  miles to the Coast Range, which alone shuts out the view of the Pacific  Ocean and bounds the horizon on the west. To the glaciers of Mt. Hood  is but little more than a day's travel. The gorge of the Columbia,  which in many respects equals, and in others surpasses the far-famed  Yosemite, may be visited in the compass of a day. The Upper Willamette,  within the limits of a few hours' trip, offers beauties equaling the  Rhine, whilst thirty-six hours gives the Lower Columbia, beside which  the Rhine and Hudson sink into insignificance. In short, within a few  hours' walk of the heart of this busy city are beauties surpassing the  White Mountains or Adirondacks, and the grandeur of the Alps lies  within the limits of a day's picnicking.    There is no better guarantee of the advantageous position of Portland  than the wealth which has accumulated here in the short period which  has elapsed since the city first sprang into existence. Theory is all  very well, but the actual proof is in the result. At the taking of the  census of 1880, Portland was the third wealthiest city in the world in  proportion to population; since that date wealth has accumulated at an  unprecedented rate, and it is probable it is to-day the wealthiest.  Among all her wealthy men, not one can be singled out who did not make  his money here, who did not come here poor to grow rich.    Portland enjoys superb advantages as a starting-point for tourist  travel. After the traveler has enjoyed the numerous attractions of that  wealthy city, traversed its beautiful avenues, viewed a strikingly  noble landscape from \"The Heights,\" and explored those charming  environs which extend for miles up and down the Willamette, there  remains perhaps the most invigorating and healthful trip of all--a  journey either by    STREAM, SOUND, OR SEA.    There must ever remain in the mind of the tourist a peculiarly  delightful recollection of a day on the majestic Columbia River, the  all too short run across that glorious sheet of water, Puget Sound, or  the fifty hours' luxurious voyage on the Pacific Ocean, from Portland  to San Francisco.    Beginning first with the Columbia River, the traveler will find solid  comfort on any one of the boats belonging to the Union Pacific Railway  fleet. This River Division is separated into three subdivisions: the  Lower Columbia from Portland to Astoria, the Middle Columbia from  Portland to Cascade Locks, and the Upper Columbia from the Cascades  to The Dalles.           *       *       *       *       *    THE UPPER COLUMBIA.    _First Tour_.--Passengers will remember that, arriving at The Dalles,  on the Union Pacific Railway, they have the option of proceeding into  Portland either by rail or river, and their ticket is available for  either route.    [Illustration: A GLIMPSE OF MOUNT ADAMS, WASHINGTON. As seen from the  Union Pacific Ry.]    The river trip will be found a very pleasant diversion after the long  railway ride, and a day's sail down the majestic Columbia is a  memory-picture which lasts a life-time. It is eighty-eight miles by rail  to Portland, the train skirting the river bank up to within a few miles  of the city. By river, it is forty-five miles to the Upper Cascades, then  a six-mile portage via narrow-gauge railway, then sixty miles by steamer  again to Portland. The boat leaves The Dalles at about 7 in the morning,  and reaches Portland at 6 in the evening. The accommodations on these  boats are first-class in every respect; good table, neat staterooms, and  courteous attendants.    This tour is planned for those who may wish to start from Portland by  the Union Pacific Railway. Take the evening train from Portland to The  Dalles. Arriving at The Dalles, walk down to the boat, which lies only  a few yards down stream from the station. Sleep on board, so that you  may be ready early in the morning for the stately panorama of the  river. Another plan is to give a day to the interesting country in the  near vicinity. The Dalles proper of the Columbia begin at Celilo,  fourteen miles above this point, and are simply a succession of rapids,  until, nearing The Dalles Station, the stream for two and a half miles  narrows down between walls of basaltic"]]]
