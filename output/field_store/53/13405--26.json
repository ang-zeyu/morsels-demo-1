We shall always be pleased  to see you, and although the forest lies some miles away, Guy can  show you good hunting, though not so good as that which, as I hear,  you can get in England, where the population is not so thick as it  is in this part of Normandy.\"    The horses were brought round, and the three lads rode into Rouen  just as night was falling.    Long before daybreak there was a stir in the streets of the city,  as parties of knights and nobles rode in with bodies of their  retainers in obedience to the orders of the duke. All in the palace  were awake early. A hasty breakfast was eaten, while just as the  sun rose the duke mounted his horse, and at the head of an array,  composed of some twenty barons and knights and four hundred  men-at-arms, rode out of the city.    \"There is a good deal more pomp and show here than there was when  we rode with Harold from London,\" Wulf said. \"In truth these Norman  nobles make a far braver appearance in their armour and robes, and  with their banners carried behind them, than we do. Were the king  himself to ride in state through London he would scarce be so gaily  attended.\"    \"Duke William does not look as if he cared for show,\" Beorn said.    \"Nor does he,\" Guy, who was riding beside them, put in. \"For himself  he is simple in his tastes, but he knows that the people are impressed  by pomp, and love to see a brave cavalcade, therefore he insists  on the observance of outward forms; and his court here on state  occasions vies, as they tell me, with that of Henry of France.\"    \"Where shall we rest tonight?\" Wulf asked. \"Methinks from the  appearance of the sky that we shall have rain, and unless we sleep  under shelter, many of these fine robes that we see are like to be  as much dabbled in mud as were those in which we arrived.\"    \"We shall sleep in no town, for there is no place on the road between  this and Eu that could receive so large a party; but soon after we  rode out yesterday a train of waggons with tents and all else needful  started from Rouen, and half-way to Eu we shall find the camp erected  and everything in readiness for our reception.\"    This was indeed the case. The camp had been erected in a sheltered  valley, through which ran a stream that supplied the needs of man  and horses. The tents were placed in regular order, that of the  duke in the centre, those of his chief nobles in order of rank on  either side. Behind was a line for the use of the court officials,  pages, and knights of less degree, while the soldiers would sleep  in the open. As the party rode up a chamberlain with three or four  assistants met them. Each was provided with lists containing the  names of all the duke's following, and these were at once conducted  to the tents alloted to them, so that in a few minutes all were  housed without the slightest confusion or trouble. The squires of  the knights and nobles and the attendants of the officers and pages  at once took the horses and picketed them in lines behind the tents,  rubbing them down and cleaning them with the greatest care, and  then supplying them with forage from the piles that had that morning  been brought in from the neighbouring farms. Fuel in abundance had  also been stacked. A number of cooks had come on with the tent  equipage, and supper was already prepared for the duke and his  party, while animals had been slaughtered and cut up, and the  men-at-arms soon had the joints hanging over their bivouac fires.    \"This is all wonderfully well managed, Beorn,\" Wulf said. \"I doubt  whether it could be done so well and orderly with us at home.\"    \"What does it matter?\" Beorn said contemptuously. \"It makes no  difference whether one sups five minutes after arrival or an hour.\"    \"It matters nothing, Beorn; but what is but a question of an hour's  waiting in a small party is one of going altogether supperless to  bed when it is a large one. The Normans have been constantly fighting  for the last twenty years, and you see they have learned how important  it is that everything should be regular and orderly. If they manage  matters with a large force as well as they do with a small one, as  it is probable that they do, see what an advantage it gives to them.  Were two armies to arrive near each other with the intention of  fighting in the morning, and one knew exactly what to do, and could  get their food in comfort and then lie down to rest, while the other  was all in confusion, no one knowing where he should go or where  to bestow himself, and, being unable to obtain food, forced to lie  down supperless, the first army would obtain a great advantage when  they met the next morning, especially if it had breakfasted well  while the other went into the fight still fasting. Look at ourselves  how weak we were that morning when we had lain down hungry and got  up fasting, while on the morning when the woman gave us that food,  simple as it was, we stepped out boldly and in spirits.\"    \"That is true enough, Wulf, but you know that among us it is said  that Earl Harold is always most careful for the comfort of his  soldiers.\"    \"Yes, the earl always thinks of those around him. As I have never  been in the field I know not what the arrangements are, but I cannot  think they would be so well ordered in a great gathering of Englishmen,  or that we should manage matters as well as the Normans with all  their experience have learnt to do.\"    \"Well, Wulf,\" Beorn laughed, \"you had best study the matter, and  then ask the earl to appoint you to take charge of the arrangements  when he takes the field.\"    \"One could hardly have a more useful office,\" Wulf said earnestly;  \"but it would need a man of experience and of high rank and position,  for our Saxon thanes are not accustomed to discipline as are these  Norman barons, and only one of great authority could induce them  to observe regulations and carry out any plan in due order.\"    Beorn nodded. \"That is true enough, Wulf, and it is therefore clear  that a good many years must pass before you can properly fill the  post of chief chamberlain to the army. For myself, I shall be well  content to do what fighting is required, and to leave all these  matters in your hands.\"    \"Yes; but it can't be left in the hands of one officer,\" Wulf said  warmly, \"unless all give their aid willingly to carry out his plans.\"    \"Well, you need not be angry about it, Wulf. There will be time  enough for that when you get to be grand chamberlain. You know  what the Saxon thanes are--how ease-loving, and averse to trouble  themselves with aught save the chase. I would as soon marshal a  flock of sheep in military order and teach each to keep its place  as get the thanes to conform to strict orders and regulations.\"    \"And yet, Beorn,\" said Baron De Burg, who had just entered the tent  unnoticed by them in order to speak to his son, who with another  page shared it with them, \"unless all will conform to strict orders  and regulations an army is but a mere gathering of armed men,  animated not by one will, but by as many wills as it contains men.  Such an army may be valiant; every man may be a hero, and yet it  may be shattered to pieces by another which gives itself up wholly  to the direction of one will. That is why we Normans have so badly  beaten the French. Every mail has his place in battle. He charges  when he is ordered to charge, or he is held in reserve the whole  day, and the battle ended without his ever striking a blow. We may  fret under inaction, we may see what we think chances of falling  upon the enemy wasted, but we know that our duke is a great leader,  that he has a plan for the battle and will carry it through, and  that disobedience to his orders would be an offence as great as  that of riding from the field. Hence we have learned to obey, and  consequently we have always been victorious against men as brave  as ourselves, but each obeying his own feudal lord, and so fighting  in detached bodies rather than as a whole. Your young companion is  in the right. In a duel between two men strength and skill is  everything; in a struggle between two armies obedience to orders  is a virtue even higher than bravery and skill at arms. Where is  Guy?\"    \"He is in attendance on the duke, my lord,\" Beorn said. \"We presented  ourselves also at his tent, but he told us that he required no duty  from us.\"    \"Let him come to my tent when he returns,\" the baron said; \"that  is as soon as he has finished supper. I shall be glad if you will  also come, unless the duke sends for you, which methinks he is not  likely to do. He is in thoughtful mood to-day, and will probably  be alone.\"    Two or three other knights were assembled in Baron de Burg's tent  when the three lads went in. De Burg said a few words to his  companions, explaining who they were, and then continued his  conversation with the others. Beorn and Wulf, as they stood behind  the chairs and listened to the talk, could not help being struck  with the difference between it and the conversations they had heard  at the houses of Saxon thanes.    With Harold they had been accustomed to hear matters of state touched  on. The church and the struggle going on between the Norman prelates  and monks on the one hand and the English clergy on the other was  one that was frequently talked over, as were also the projects  Harold had at heart for encouraging the spread of education and  raising the condition of people generally. At the houses of the  thanes, however, the evenings were passed in feasting and song, and  it was seldom that there was anything like discussion upon general  affairs. Indeed, between men heated with wine and accustomed to  state their opinions bluntly anything like friendly argument was  well nigh impossible. De Burg and his companions made no allusion  at all to public affairs, but discussed gravely and calmly, and  with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#19)"],[1,"erudition--he was still, at sixty, quite unacquainted  with public affairs, and had neither the politician's tact necessary  to draw a state paper as Clarendon would have drawn it, nor the  literary tact which had enabled Erasmus to command the ear of the  public. Salmasius undertook his task as a professional advocate,  though without pay, and Milton accepted the duty of replying as  advocate for the Parliament, also without reward; he was fighting for  a cause which was not another's but his own.    Salmasius' _Defensio regia_--that was the title of his book--reached  this country before the end of 1649. The Council of State, in very  unnecessary alarm, issued a prohibition. On 8th January, 1650, the  Council ordered \"that Mr. Milton do prepare something in answer to the  book of Salmasius.\" Early in March, 1651, Milton's answer, entitled  _Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio_, was out.    Milton was as much above Salmasius in mental power as he was inferior  to him in extent of book knowledge. But the conditions of retort which  he had chosen to accept neutralised this superiority. His greater  power was spent in a greater force of invective. Instead of setting  out the case of the Parliament in all the strength of which it was  capable, Milton is intent upon tripping up Salmasius, contradicting  him, and making him odious or ridiculous. He called his book a  _Defence of the People of England_; but when he should have been  justifying his clients from the charges of rebellion and regicide  before the bar of Europe, Milton is bending all his invention upon  personalities. He exaggerates the foibles of Salmasius, his vanity,  and the vanity of Madame de Saumaise, her ascendancy over her husband,  his narrow pedantry, his ignorance of everything but grammar and  words. He exhausts the Latin vocabulary of abuse to pile up every  epithet of contumely and execration on the head of his adversary. It  but amounts to calling Salmasius fool and knave through a couple of  hundred pages, till the exaggeration of the style defeats the orator's  purpose, and we end by regarding the whole, not as a serious pleading,  but as an epideictic display. Hobbes said truly that the two books  were \"like two declamations, for and against, made by one and the same  man as a rhetorical exercise\" (_Behemoth_).    Milton's _Defensio_ was not calculated to advance the cause of the  Parliament, and there is no evidence that it produced any effect upon  the public, beyond that of raising Milton's personal credit. That  England, and Puritan England, where humane studies were swamped in a  biblical brawl, should produce a man who could write Latin as well  as Salmasius, was a great surprise to the learned world in Holland.  Salmasius was unpopular at Leyden, and there was therefore a  predisposition to regard Milton's book with favour. Salmasius was  twenty years older than Milton, and in these literary digladiations  readers are always ready to side with a new writer. The contending  interests of the two great English parties, the wider issue between  republic and absolutism, the speculative inquiry into the right of  resistance, were lost sight of by the spectators of this literary  duel. The only question was whether Salmasius could beat the new  champion, or the new man beat Salmasius, at a match of vituperation.    Salmasius of course put in a rejoinder. His rapid pen found no  difficulty in turning off 300 pages of fluent Latin. It was his  last occupation. He died at Spa, where he was taking the waters, in  September, 1653, and his reply was not published till 1660, after the  Restoration, when all interest had died out of the controversy. If it  be true that the work was written at Spa, without books at hand, it  is certainly a miraculous effort of memory. It does no credit to  Salmasius. He had raked together, after the example of Scioppius  against Scaliger, all the tittle-tattle which the English exiles had  to retail about Milton and his antecedents. Bramhall, who bore Milton  a special grudge, was the channel of some of this scandal, and  Bramhall's source was possibly Chappell, the tutor with whom Milton  had had the early misunderstanding. (See above p. 6). If any one  thinks that classical studies of themselves cultivate the taste and  the sentiments, let him look into Salmasius's _Responsio_. There he  will see the first scholar of his age not thinking it unbecoming to  taunt Milton with his blindness, in such language as this: \"a puppy,  once my pretty little man, now blear-eyed, or rather a blindling;  having never had any mental vision, he has now lost his bodily sight;  a silly coxcomb, fancying himself a beauty; an unclean beast, with  nothing more human about him than his guttering eyelids; the fittest  doom for him would be to hang him on the highest gallows, and set his  head on the Tower of London.\" These are some of the incivilities, not  by any means the most revolting, but such as I dare reproduce, of this  literary warfare.    Salmasius's taunt about Milton's venal pen is no less false than his  other gibes. The places of those who served the Commonwealth, were  places of \"hard work and short rations.\" Milton never received for his  _Defensio_ a sixpence beyond his official salary. It has indeed been  asserted that he was paid 1000 l.. for it by order of Parliament,  and this falsehood having been adopted by Johnson--himself a  pensioner--has passed into all the biographies, and will no doubt  continue to be repeated to the end of time. This is a just nemesis  upon Milton, who on his part had twitted Salmasius with having been  complimented by the exiled King with a purse of 100 Jacobuses for his  performance. The one insinuation was as false as the other. Charles  II. was too poor to offer more than thanks. Milton was too proud to  receive for defending his country what the Parliament was willing to  pay. Sir Peter Wentworth, of Lillingston Lovell, in Oxfordshire, left  in his will 100 l. to Milton for his book against Salmasius. But this  was long after the Restoration, and Milton did not live to receive the  legacy.    Instead of receiving an honorarium for his _Defence of the English  People_, Milton had paid for it a sacrifice for which money could not  compensate him. His eyesight, though quick, as he was a proficient  with the rapier, had never been strong. His constant headaches, his  late study, and (thinks Phillips) his perpetual tampering with physic  to preserve his sight, concurred to bring the calamity upon him. It  had been steadily coming on for a dozen years before, and about 1650  the sight of the left eye was gone. He was warned by his doctor that  if he persisted in using the remaining eye for book-work, he would  lose that too. \"The choice lay before me,\" Milton writes in the  _Second Defence_, \"between dereliction of a supreme duty and loss of  eyesight; in such a case I could not listen to the physician, not if  Aesculapius himself had spoken from his sanctuary; I could not but  obey that inward monitor, I know not what, that spake to me from  heaven. I considered with myself that many had purchased less good  with worse ill, as they who give their lives to reap only glory, and I  thereupon concluded to employ the little remaining eyesight I was to  enjoy in doing this, the greatest service to the common weal it was in  my power to render.\"    It was about the early part of the year 1652 that the calamity was  consummated. At the age of forty-three he was in total darkness.  The deprivation of sight, one of the severest afflictions of which  humanity is capable, falls more heavily on the man whose occupation  lies among books, than upon others. He who has most to lose, loses  most. To most persons books are but an amusement, an interlude between  the hours of serious occupation. The scholar is he who has found the  key to knowledge, and knows his way about in the world of printed  books. To find this key, to learn the map of this country, requires a  long apprenticeship. This is a point few men can hope to reach much  before the age of forty. Milton had attained it only to find fruition  snatched from him. He had barely time to spell one line in the book of  wisdom, before, like the wizard's volume in romance, it was hopelessly  closed against him for ever. Any human being is shut out by loss  of sight from accustomed pleasures, the scholar is shut out from  knowledge. Shut out at forty-three, when his great work was not even  begun! He consoles himself with the fancy that in his pamphlet, the  _Defensio_, he had done a great work (_quanta maxima quivi_) for  his country. This poor delusion helped him doubtless to support his  calamity. He could not foresee that, in less than ten years, the great  work would he totally annihilated, his pamphlet would he merged in the  obsolete mass of civil war tracts, and the _Defensio_, on which he had  expended his last year of eyesight, only mentioned because it had been  written by the author of _Paradise Lost_.    The nature of Milton's disease is not ascertainable from the account  he has given of it. In the well-known passage of _Paradise Lost_,  iii. 25, he hesitates between amaurosis (drop serene) and cataract  (suffusion)        So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs,      Or dim suffusion veil'd.    A medical friend referred to by Professor Alfred Stern, tells him that  some of the symptoms are more like glaucoma. Milton himself has left  such an account as a patient ignorant of the anatomy of the organ  could give. It throws no light on the nature of the malady. But it is  characteristic of Milton that even his affliction does not destroy his  solicitude about his personal appearance. The taunts of his enemies  about \"the lack-lustre eye, guttering with prevalent rheum\" did not  pass unfelt. In his _Second Defence_ Milton informs the world that his  eyes \"are externally uninjured. They shine with an unclouded light,  just like the eyes"]]]
