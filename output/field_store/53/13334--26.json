It must be said, in conclusion, that there is the greatest cause for  gratitude that all the boats launched carried their passengers safely  to the rescue ship. It would not be right to accept this fact without  calling attention to it: it would be easy to enumerate many things  which might have been present as elements of danger.          CHAPTER VII    THE CARPATHIA'S RETURN TO NEW YORK      The journey of the Carpathia from the time she caught the \"C.Q.D.\"  from the Titanic at about 12.30 A.M. on Monday morning and turned  swiftly about to her rescue, until she arrived at New York on the  following Thursday at 8.30 P.M. was one that demanded of the captain,  officers and crew of the vessel the most exact knowledge of  navigation, the utmost vigilance in every department both before and  after the rescue, and a capacity for organization that must sometimes  have been taxed to the breaking point.    The extent to which all these qualities were found present and the  manner in which they were exercised stands to the everlasting credit  of the Cunard Line and those of its servants who were in charge of the  Carpathia. Captain Rostron's part in all this is a great one, and  wrapped up though his action is in a modesty that is conspicuous in  its nobility, it stands out even in his own account as a piece of work  well and courageously done.    As soon as the Titanic called for help and gave her position, the  Carpathia was turned and headed north: all hands were called on duty,  a new watch of stokers was put on, and the highest speed of which she  was capable was demanded of the engineers, with the result that the  distance of fifty-eight miles between the two ships was covered in  three and a half hours, a speed well beyond her normal capacity. The  three doctors on board each took charge of a saloon, in readiness to  render help to any who needed their services, the stewards and  catering staff were hard at work preparing hot drinks and meals, and  the purser's staff ready with blankets and berths for the shipwrecked  passengers as soon as they got on board. On deck the sailors got ready  lifeboats, swung them out on the davits, and stood by, prepared to  lower away their crews if necessary; fixed rope-ladders,  cradle-chairs, nooses, and bags for the children at the hatches, to  haul the rescued up the side. On the bridge was the captain with his  officers, peering into the darkness eagerly to catch the first signs  of the crippled Titanic, hoping, in spite of her last despairing  message of \"Sinking by the head,\" to find her still afloat when her  position was reached. A double watch of lookout men was set, for there  were other things as well as the Titanic to look for that night, and  soon they found them. As Captain Rostron said in his evidence, they  saw icebergs on either side of them between 2.45 and 4 A.M., passing  twenty large ones, one hundred to two hundred feet high, and many  smaller ones, and \"frequently had to manoeuvre the ship to avoid  them.\" It was a time when every faculty was called upon for the  highest use of which it was capable. With the knowledge before them  that the enormous Titanic, the supposedly unsinkable ship, had struck  ice and was sinking rapidly; with the lookout constantly calling to  the bridge, as he must have done, \"Icebergs on the starboard,\"  \"Icebergs on the port,\" it required courage and judgment beyond the  ordinary to drive the ship ahead through that lane of icebergs and  \"manoeuvre round them.\" As he himself said, he \"took the risk of full  speed in his desire to save life, and probably some people might blame  him for taking such a risk.\" But the Senate Committee assured him that  they, at any rate, would not, and we of the lifeboats have certainly  no desire to do so.    The ship was finally stopped at 4 A.M., with an iceberg reported dead  ahead (the same no doubt we had to row around in boat 13 as we  approached the Carpathia), and about the same time the first lifeboat  was sighted. Again she had to be manoeuvred round the iceberg to pick  up the boat, which was the one in charge of Mr. Boxhall. From him the  captain learned that the Titanic had gone down, and that he was too  late to save any one but those in lifeboats, which he could now see  drawing up from every part of the horizon. Meanwhile, the passengers  of the Carpathia, some of them aroused by the unusual vibration of the  screw, some by sailors tramping overhead as they swung away the  lifeboats and got ropes and lowering tackle ready, were beginning to  come on deck just as day broke; and here an extraordinary sight met  their eyes. As far as the eye could reach to the north and west lay an  unbroken stretch of field ice, with icebergs still attached to the  floe and rearing aloft their mass as a hill might suddenly rise from a  level plain. Ahead and to the south and east huge floating monsters  were showing up through the waning darkness, their number added to  moment by moment as the dawn broke and flushed the horizon pink. It is  remarkable how \"busy\" all those icebergs made the sea look: to have  gone to bed with nothing but sea and sky and to come on deck to find  so many objects in sight made quite a change in the character of the  sea: it looked quite crowded; and a lifeboat alongside and people  clambering aboard, mostly women, in nightdresses and dressing-gowns,  in cloaks and shawls, in anything but ordinary clothes! Out ahead and  on all sides little torches glittered faintly for a few moments and  then guttered out--and shouts and cheers floated across the quiet sea.  It would be difficult to imagine a more unexpected sight than this  that lay before the Carpathia's passengers as they lined the sides  that morning in the early dawn.    No novelist would dare to picture such an array of beautiful climatic  conditions,--the rosy dawn, the morning star, the moon on the horizon,  the sea stretching in level beauty to the sky-line,--and on this sea  to place an ice-field like the Arctic regions and icebergs in numbers  everywhere,--white and turning pink and deadly cold,--and near them,  rowing round the icebergs to avoid them, little boats coming suddenly  out of mid-ocean, with passengers rescued from the most wonderful ship  the world has known. No artist would have conceived such a picture: it  would have seemed so highly dramatic as to border on the impossible,  and would not have been attempted. Such a combination of events would  pass the limit permitted the imagination of both author and artist.    The passengers crowded the rails and looked down at us as we rowed up  in the early morning; stood quietly aside while the crew at the  gangways below took us aboard, and watched us as if the ship had been  in dock and we had rowed up to join her in a somewhat unusual way.  Some of them have related that we were very quiet as we came aboard:  it is quite true, we were; but so were they. There was very little  excitement on either side: just the quiet demeanour of people who are  in the presence of something too big as yet to lie within their mental  grasp, and which they cannot yet discuss. And so they asked us  politely to have hot coffee, which we did; and food, which we  generally declined,--we were not hungry,--and they said very little at  first about the lost Titanic and our adventures in the night.    Much that is exaggerated and false has been written about the mental  condition of passengers as they came aboard: we have been described as  being too dazed to understand what was happening, as being too  overwhelmed to speak, and as looking before us with \"set, staring  gaze,\" \"dazed with the shadow of the dread event.\" That is, no doubt,  what most people would expect in the circumstances, but I know it does  not give a faithful record of how we did arrive: in fact it is simply  not true. As remarked before, the one thing that matters in describing  an event of this kind is the exact truth, as near as the fallible  human mind can state it; and my own impression of our mental condition  is that of supreme gratitude and relief at treading the firm decks of  a ship again. I am aware that experiences differed considerably  according to the boats occupied; that those who were uncertain of the  fate of their relatives and friends had much to make them anxious and  troubled; and that it is not possible to look into another person's  consciousness and say what is written there; but dealing with mental  conditions as far as they are delineated by facial and bodily  expressions, I think joy, relief, gratitude were the dominant emotions  written on the faces of those who climbed the rope-ladders and were  hauled up in cradles.    It must not be forgotten that no one in any one boat knew who were  saved in other boats: few knew even how many boats there were and how  many passengers could be saved. It was at the time probable that  friends would follow them to the Carpathia, or be found on other  steamers, or even on the pier at which we landed. The hysterical  scenes that have been described are imaginative; true, one woman did  fill the saloon with hysterical cries immediately after coming aboard,  but she could not have known for a certainty that any of her friends  were lost: probably the sense of relief after some hours of journeying  about the sea was too much for her for a time.    One of the first things we did was to crowd round a steward with a  bundle of telegraph forms. He was the bearer of the welcome news that  passengers might send Marconigrams to their relatives free of charge,  and soon he bore away the first sheaf of hastily scribbled messages to  the operator; by the time the last boatload was aboard, the pile must  have risen high in the Marconi cabin.

It had not occurred to Lord Dawlish,  when in an access of wistful yearning he had decided to sneak up  to the house in order to increase his anguish by one last glimpse  of Claire, that other members of the household might be out in the  grounds. He was just thinking sorrowfully, as he listened to the  music, how like his own position was to that of the hero of  Tennyson's _Maud_--a poem to which he was greatly addicted,  when Mr Pickering's 'Hi!' came out of nowhere and hit him like a  torpedo.    He turned in agitation. Mr Pickering having prudently elected to  stay in the shadows, there was no one to be seen. It was as if the  voice of conscience had shouted 'Hi!' at him. He was just  wondering if he had imagined the whole thing, when he perceived  the red glow of a cigar and beyond it a shadowy form.    It was not the fact that he was in an equivocal position, staring  into a house which did not belong to him, with his feet on  somebody else's private soil, that caused Bill to act as he did.  It was the fact that at that moment he was not feeling equal to  conversation with anybody on any subject whatsoever. It did not  occur to him that his behaviour might strike a nervous stranger as  suspicious. All he aimed at was the swift removal of himself from  a spot infested by others of his species. He ran, and Mr  Pickering, having followed him with the eye of fear, went rather  shakily into the house, his brain whirling with professional  cracksmen and gas pipes and assaulted butlers, to relate his  adventure.    'A great, hulking, ruffianly sort of fellow glaring in at the  window,' said Mr Pickering. 'I shouted at him and he ran like a  rabbit.'    'Gee! Must have been one of the gang that's been working down  here,' said Roscoe Sherriff. 'There might be a quarter of a column  in that, properly worked, but I guess I'd better wait until he  actually does bust the place.'    'We must notify the police!'    'Notify the police, and have them butt in and stop the thing and  kill a good story!' There was honest amazement in the Press-agent's  voice. 'Let me tell you, it isn't so easy to get publicity  these days that you want to go out of your way to stop it!'    Mr Pickering was appalled. A dislike of this man, which had grown  less vivid since his scene with Claire, returned to him with  redoubled force.    'Why, we may all be murdered in our beds!' he cried.    'Front-page stuff!' said Roscoe Sherriff, with gleaming eyes. 'And  three columns at least. Fine!'    It might have consoled Lord Dawlish somewhat, as he lay awake  that night, to have known that the man who had taken Claire from  him--though at present he was not aware of such a man's  existence--also slept ill.          13      Lady Wetherby sat in her room, writing letters. The rest of the  household were variously employed. Roscoe Sherriff was prowling  about the house, brooding on campaigns of publicity. Dudley  Pickering was walking in the grounds with Claire. In a little  shack in the woods that adjoined the high-road, which he had  converted into a temporary studio, Lord Wetherby was working on a  picture which he proposed to call 'Innocence', a study of a small  Italian child he had discovered in Washington Square. Lady  Wetherby, who had been taken to see the picture, had suggested  'The Black Hand's Newest Recruit' as a better title than the one  selected by the artist.    It is a fact to be noted that of the entire household only Lady  Wetherby could fairly be described as happy. It took very little to  make Lady Wetherby happy. Fine weather, good food, and a complete  abstention from classical dancing--give her these and she asked no  more. She was, moreover, delighted at Claire's engagement. It  seemed to her, for she had no knowledge of the existence of Lord  Dawlish, a genuine manifestation of Love's Young Dream. She liked  Dudley Pickering and she was devoted to Claire. It made her happy  to think that it was she who had brought them together.    But of the other members of the party, Dudley Pickering was  unhappy because he feared that burglars were about to raid the  house; Roscoe Sherriff because he feared they were not; Claire  because, now that the news of the engagement was out, it seemed to  be everybody's aim to leave her alone with Mr Pickering, whose  undiluted society tended to pall. And Lord Wetherby was unhappy  because he found Eustace, the monkey, a perpetual strain upon his  artistic nerves. It was Eustace who had driven him to his shack in  the woods. He could have painted far more comfortably in the  house, but Eustace had developed a habit of stealing up to him and  plucking the leg of his trousers; and an artist simply cannot give  of his best with that sort of thing going on.    Lady Wetherby wrote on. She was not fond of letter-writing and she  had allowed her correspondence to accumulate; but she was  disposing of it in an energetic and conscientious way, when the  entrance of Wrench, the butler, interrupted her.    Wrench had been imported from England at the request of Lord  Wetherby, who had said that it soothed him and kept him from  feeling home-sick to see a butler about the place. Since then he  had been hanging to the establishment as it were by a hair. He  gave the impression of being always on the point of giving notice.  There were so many things connected with his position of which he  disapproved. He had made no official pronouncement of the matter,  but Lady Wetherby knew that he disapproved of her classical  dancing. His last position had been with the Dowager Duchess of  Waveney, the well-known political hostess, who--even had the  somewhat generous lines on which she was built not prevented the  possibility of such a thing--would have perished rather than dance  barefooted in a public restaurant. Wrench also disapproved of  America. That fact had been made plain immediately upon his  arrival in the country. He had given America one look, and then  his mind was made up--he disapproved of it.    'If you please, m'lady!'    Lady Wetherby turned. The butler was looking even more than  usually disapproving, and his disapproval had, so to speak,  crystallized, as if it had found some more concrete and definite  objective than either barefoot dancing or the United States.    'If you please, m'lady--the hape!'    It was Wrench's custom to speak of Eustace in a tone of restrained  disgust. He disapproved of Eustace. The Dowager Duchess of  Waveney, though she kept open house for members of Parliament,  would have drawn the line at monkeys.    'The hape is behaving very strange, m'lady,' said Wrench,  frostily.    It has been well said that in this world there is always  something. A moment before, Lady Wetherby had been feeling  completely contented, without a care on her horizon. It was  foolish of her to have expected such a state of things to last,  for what is life but a series of sharp corners, round each of  which Fate lies in wait for us with a stuffed eel-skin? Something  in the butler's manner, a sort of gloating gloom which he  radiated, told her that she had arrived at one of these corners  now.    'The hape is seated on the kitchen-sink, m'lady, throwing new-laid  eggs at the scullery-maid, and cook desired me to step up and ask  for instructions.'    'What!' Lady Wetherby rose in agitation. 'What's he doing that  for?' she asked, weakly.    A slight, dignified gesture was Wrench's only reply. It was not  his place to analyse the motives of monkeys.    'Throwing eggs!'    The sight of Lady Wetherby's distress melted the butler's stern  reserve. He unbent so far as to supply a clue.    'As I understand from cook, m'lady, the animal appears to have  taken umbrage at a lack of cordiality on the part of the cat. It  seems that the hape attempted to fondle the cat, but the latter  scratched him; being suspicious,' said Wrench, 'of his _bona  fides_.' He scrutinized the ceiling with a dull eye. 'Whereupon,'  he continued, 'he seized her tail and threw her with considerable  force. He then removed himself to the sink and began to hurl eggs  at the scullery-maid.'    Lady Wetherby's mental eye attempted to produce a picture of the  scene, but failed.    'I suppose I had better go down and see about it,' she said.    Wrench withdrew his gaze from the ceiling.    'I think it would be advisable, m'lady. The scullery-maid is  already in hysterics.'    Lady Wetherby led the way to the kitchen. She was wroth with  Eustace. This was just the sort of thing out of which Algie would  be able to make unlimited capital. It weakened her position with  Algie. There was only one thing to do--she must hush it up.    Her first glance, however, at the actual theatre of war gave her  the impression that matters had advanced beyond the hushing-up  stage. A yellow desolation brooded over the kitchen. It was not so  much a kitchen as an omelette. There were eggs everywhere, from  floor to ceiling. She crunched her way in on a carpet of oozing  shells.    Her entry was a signal for a renewal on a more impressive scale of  the uproar that she had heard while opening the door. The air was  full of voices. The cook was expressing herself in Norwegian, the  parlour-maid in what appeared to be Erse. On a chair in a corner  the scullery-maid sobbed and whooped. The odd-job man, who was a  baseball enthusiast, was speaking in terms of high praise of  Eustace's combined speed and control.    The only calm occupant of the room was Eustace himself, who,  either through a shortage of ammunition or through weariness of  the pitching-arm, had suspended active hostilities, and was now  looking down on the scene from a high shelf. There was a brooding  expression in his deep-set eyes. He massaged his right ear with  the sole of his left foot in a somewhat _distrait_ manner.    'Eustace!' cried Lady Wetherby, severely.    Eustace lowered his foot and gazed at her meditatively, then at  the odd-j"]]]
