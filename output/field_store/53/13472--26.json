McCurdie lit a  pipe, Doyne another black cigar. The train thundered on.    Presently they all lunched together in the restaurant car. The windows  steamed, but here and there through a wiped patch of pane a white world  was revealed. The snow was falling. As they passed through Westbury,  McCurdie looked mechanically for the famous white horse carved into the  chalk of the down; but it was not visible beneath the thick covering of  snow.    \"It'll be just like this all the way to Gehenna--Trehenna, I mean,\" said  McCurdie.    Doyne nodded. He had done his life's work amid all extreme fiercenesses  of heat and cold, in burning droughts, in simoons and in icy  wildernesses, and a ray or two more of the pale sun or a flake or two  more of the gentle snow of England mattered to him but little. But  Biggleswade rubbed the pane with his table-napkin and gazed  apprehensively at the prospect.    \"If only this wretched train would stop,\" said he, \"I would go back  again.\"    And he thought how comfortable it would be to sneak home again to his  books and thus elude not only the Deverills, but the Christmas jollities  of his sisters' families, who would think him miles away. But the train  was timed not to stop till Plymouth, two hundred and thirty-five miles  from London, and thither was he being relentlessly carried. Then he  quarrelled with his food, which brought a certain consolation.           *       *       *       *       *    The train did stop, however, before Plymouth--indeed, before Exeter. An  accident on the line had dislocated the traffic. The express was held up  for an hour, and when it was permitted to proceed, instead of thundering  on, it went cautiously, subject to continual stoppings. It arrived at  Plymouth two hours late. The travellers learned that they had missed the  connection on which they had counted and that they could not reach  Trehenna till nearly ten o'clock. After weary waiting at Plymouth they  took their seats in the little, cold local train that was to carry them  another stage on their journey. Hot-water cans put in at Plymouth  mitigated to some extent the iciness of the compartment. But that only  lasted a comparatively short time, for soon they were set down at a  desolate, shelterless wayside junction, dumped in the midst of a hilly  snow-covered waste, where they went through another weary wait for  another dismal local train that was to carry them to Trehenna. And in  this train there were no hot-water cans, so that the compartment was as  cold as death. McCurdie fretted and shook his fist in the direction of  Trehenna.    \"And when we get there we have still a twenty miles' motor drive to  Foullis Castle. It's a fool name and we're fools to be going there.\"    \"I shall die of bronchitis,\" wailed Professor Biggleswade.    \"A man dies when it is appointed for him to die,\" said Lord Doyne, in  his tired way; and he went on smoking long black cigars.    \"It's not the dying that worries me,\" said McCurdie. \"That's a mere  mechanical process which every organic being from a king to a  cauliflower has to pass through. It's the being forced against my will  and my reason to come on this accursed journey, which something tells me  will become more and more accursed as we go on, that is driving me to  distraction.\"    \"What will be, will be,\" said Doyne.    \"I can't see where the comfort of that reflection comes in,\" said  Biggleswade.    \"And yet you've travelled in the East,\" said Doyne. \"I suppose you know  the Valley of the Tigris as well as any man living.\"    \"Yes,\" said the Professor. \"I can say I dug my way from Tekrit to Bagdad  and left not a stone unexamined.\"    \"Perhaps, after all,\" Doyne remarked, \"that's not quite the way to know  the East.\"    \"I never wanted to know the modern East,\" returned the Professor. \"What  is there in it of interest compared with the mighty civilizations that  have gone before?\"    McCurdie took a pull from his flask.    \"I'm glad I thought of having a refill at Plymouth,\" said he.    At last, after many stops at little lonely stations they arrived at  Trehenna. The guard opened the door and they stepped out on to the  snow-covered platform. An oil lamp hung from the tiny pent-house roof  that, structurally, was Trehenna Station. They looked around at the  silent gloom of white undulating moorland, and it seemed a place where  no man lived and only ghosts could have a bleak and unsheltered being. A  porter came up and helped the guard with the luggage. Then they realized  that the station was built on a small embankment, for, looking over the  railing, they saw below the two great lamps of a motor car. A fur-clad  chauffeur met them at the bottom of the stairs. He clapped his hands  together and informed them cheerily that he had been waiting for four  hours. It was the bitterest winter in these parts within the memory of  man, said he, and he himself had not seen snow there for five years.  Then he settled the three travellers in the great roomy touring car  covered with a Cape-cart hood, wrapped them up in many rugs and started.    After a few moments, the huddling together of their bodies--for, the  Professor being a spare man, there was room for them all on the back  seat--the pile of rugs, the serviceable and all but air-tight hood,  induced a pleasant warmth and a pleasant drowsiness. Where they were  being driven they knew not. The perfectly upholstered seat eased their  limbs, the easy swinging motion of the car soothed their spirits. They  felt that already they had reached the luxuriously appointed home which,  after all, they knew awaited them. McCurdie no longer railed, Professor  Biggleswade forgot the dangers of bronchitis, and Lord Doyne twisted the  stump of a black cigar between his lips without any desire to relight  it. A tiny electric lamp inside the hood made the darkness of the world  to right and left and in front of the talc windows still darker.  McCurdie and Biggleswade fell into a doze. Lord Doyne chewed the end of  his cigar. The car sped on through an unseen wilderness.    Suddenly there was a horrid jolt and a lurch and a leap and a rebound,  and then the car stood still, quivering like a ship that has been struck  by a heavy sea. The three men were pitched and tossed and thrown  sprawling over one another onto the bottom of the car. Biggleswade  screamed. McCurdie cursed. Doyne scrambled from the confusion of rugs  and limbs and, tearing open the side of the Cape-cart hood, jumped out.  The chauffeur had also just leaped from his seat. It was pitch dark save  for the great shaft of light down the snowy road cast by the acetylene  lamps. The snow had ceased falling.    \"What's gone wrong?\"    \"It sounds like the axle,\" said the chauffeur ruefully.    He unshipped a lamp and examined the car, which had wedged itself  against a great drift of snow on the off side. Meanwhile McCurdie and  Biggleswade had alighted.    \"Yes, it's the axle,\" said the chauffeur.    \"Then we're done,\" remarked Doyne.    \"I'm afraid so, my lord.\"    \"What's the matter? Can't we get on?\" asked Biggleswade in his querulous  voice.    McCurdie laughed. \"How can we get on with a broken axle? The thing's as  useless as a man with a broken back. Gad, I was right. I said it was  going to be an infernal journey.\"    The little Professor wrung his hands. \"But what's to be done?\" he cried.    \"Tramp it,\" said Lord Doyne, lighting a fresh cigar.    \"It's ten miles,\" said the chauffeur.    \"It would be the death of me,\" the Professor wailed.    \"I utterly refuse to walk ten miles through a Polar waste with a gouty  foot,\" McCurdie declared wrathfully.    The chauffeur offered a solution of the difficulty. He would set out  alone for Foullis Castle--five miles farther on was an inn where he  could obtain a horse and trap--and would return for the three gentlemen  with another car. In the meanwhile they could take shelter in a little  house which they had just passed, some half mile up the road. This was  agreed to. The chauffeur went on cheerily enough with a lamp, and the  three travellers with another lamp started off in the opposite  direction. As far as they could see they were in a long, desolate  valley, a sort of No Man's Land, deathly silent. The eastern sky had  cleared somewhat, and they faced a loose rack through which one pale  star was dimly visible.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I'm a man of science,\" said McCurdie as they trudged through the snow,  \"and I dismiss the supernatural as contrary to reason; but I have  Highland blood in my veins that plays me exasperating tricks. My reason  tells me that this place is only a commonplace moor, yet it seems like a  Valley of Bones haunted by malignant spirits who have lured us here to  our destruction. There's something guiding us now. It's just uncanny.\"    \"Why on earth did we ever come?\" croaked Biggleswade.    Lord Doyne answered: \"The Koran says, 'Nothing can befall us but what  God hath destined for us.' So why worry?\"    \"Because I'm not a Mohammedan,\" retorted Biggleswade.    \"You might be worse,\" said Doyne.    Presently the dim outline of the little house grew perceptible. A faint  light shone from the window. It stood unfenced by any kind of hedge or  railing a few feet away from the road in a little hollow beneath some  rising ground. As far as they could discern in the darkness when they  drew near, the house was a mean, dilapidated hovel. A guttering candle  stood on the inner sill of the small window and afforded a vague view  into a mean interior. Doyne held up the lamp so that its rays fell full  on the door. As he did so, an exclamation broke from his lips and he  hurried forward, followed by the others. A man's body lay huddled  together on the snow by the threshold. He was dressed like a peasant, in  old corduroy trousers and rough coat, and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],[0,"Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#2)"],[1," food and the various plants used  for food.[2]    [Footnote 2: The Flour Mills of Minneapolis: Century Magazine, May, 1886.  Maize: Popular Science News, Nov. and Dec., 1888.]      2. _Clothing_.--Plants are used for clothing. Of the four great clothing  materials, cotton, linen, silk, and woollen, the first two are of  vegetable, the last two of animal origin. Cotton is made from the hairs of  the seed of the cotton plant.[1] Linen is made of the inner fibre of  the bark of the flax plant. It has been cultivated from the earliest  historical times.    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. II. The Cotton Plant.]      3. _Purification of the Air_.--The following questions and experiments are  intended to show the pupils, first, that we live in an atmosphere, the  presence of which is necessary to support life and combustion (1) and (2);  secondly, that this atmosphere is deprived of its power to support life  and combustion by the actions of combustion (2), and of respiration (3);  thirdly, that this power is restored to the air by the action of plants  (4).    We have the air about us everywhere. A so-called empty vessel is one  where the contents are invisible. The following experiment is a good  illustration of this.    (1) Wrap the throat of a glass funnel with moistened cloth or paper so  that it will fit tightly into the neck of a bottle, and fill the funnel  with water. If the space between the funnel and the bottle is air-tight,  the water will not flow into the bottle.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    Do not explain this in advance to the pupils. Ask them what prevents  the water from flowing into the bottle. If they are puzzled, loosen the  funnel, and show them that the water will now flow in. In the first case,  as the air could not escape, the water could not flow in; in the second,  the air was displaced by the heavier water.    Ask the pupils why the air in a crowded room becomes so difficult to  breathe. Could a person live if he were shut up in an air-tight room for a  long time? Fresh air is necessary to life. The teacher may explain that it  is the oxygen in the air that supports life. Air is composed one-fifth of  this gas and four-fifths of nitrogen. The gases are mixed and the nitrogen  simply dilutes the oxygen, as it were.    Fresh air is necessary to support combustion as well as life. Ask them why  we put out a fire by throwing a blanket or a rug over it. The following  experiment illustrates this.    (2) Take a small, wide-mouthed bottle, covered with a card or cork. To  this cover fasten a piece of bent wire with a taper on the end. Light the  taper and lower it into the jar. It will burn a few seconds and then go  out. Raise and light it again, and it will be extinguished as soon as it  is plunged into the bottle. This shows that the oxygen of the air is used  up by burning substances, as it is by breathing animals.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The following experiment shows that fire will not burn in an atmosphere of  gas from our lungs.    (3) Fill a bottle with gas by breathing into it through a bit of glass  tubing, passed through a card or cork, and reaching to the bottom of the  bottle. The bottle will be dimmed with moisture, showing the presence of  aqueous vapor. A lighted match plunged into the bottle will be immediately  extinguished. A better way, which, however, takes some skill in  manipulation, is to fill the bottle with water, cover it with a flat piece  of glass, and invert the bottle in a dish of water, taking care that no  air bubbles enter. Then, through a bit of glass tubing, blow into the  bottle till the water is expelled. Cover the mouth with the glass under  water, and holding it tightly down, invert the bottle quickly. Set it  down, light a match, take away the glass, and at the same instant plunge  in the match. If no air has been allowed to enter, the match will go out  at once. No animal could live in an atmosphere which could not support  combustion.    From these experiments the pupils have seen that the life-sustaining  quality of the air is used up by combustion and respiration. To bring in  the subject of purification by plants, ask them why all the oxygen in  the world is not exhausted by the people and the fires in it. After the  subject has been explained, the following experiment can be prepared and  put aside till the next lesson.    (4) Fill two bottles with air from the lungs, as in (3) having previously  introduced a cutting from a plant into one of the bottles. Allow them to  stand in the sun for a day or two. Then test both bottles with a burning  match. If properly done, the result will be very striking. The end of  the cutting should be in the water of the dish. This experiment will not  succeed excepting with bottles such as are used for chemicals, which have  their mouths carefully ground. Common bottles allow the air to enter  between the bottle and the glass.[1]    [Footnote 1: See note on page 13.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]      4. _Fuel_.--Light a match and allow it to burn until half charred. Blow it  out gently, so as to leave a glowing spark. When this spark goes out it  will leave behind a light, gray ash. We have to consider the flame, the  charred substance, and the ash.    Flame is burning gas. In all ordinary fuels, carbon and hydrogen, in  various combinations and free, make the principal part. The first effect  of the heat is to set free the volatile compounds of carbon and hydrogen.  The hydrogen then begins to unite with the oxygen of the air, forming  water, setting free the carbon, which also unites with oxygen, forming  carbonic acid gas. The burning gases cause the flame. The following  experiment will illustrate this.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    (5) Fit a test-tube with a tight cork, through which a bit of glass  tubing, drawn out into a jet, is passed, the tubing within being even with  the cork. Place some bits of shaving in the tube, cork it, and make the  cork perfectly air-tight by coating it with bees wax or paraffine. Heat  the test-tube gently over an alcohol lamp. The wood turns black, and vapor  issues from the jet, which may be lighted (Fig. 4). Care should be taken  to expel all the air before lighting.    (6) That the burning hydrogen forms water by uniting with the oxygen of  the air, may be shown by holding a cold glass tumbler over the jet, or  over any flame. The glass will be dimmed by drops of moisture.    The charred part of the wood is charcoal, which is one form of carbon.  Our ordinary charcoal is made by driving off all the gases from wood, by  burning it under cover where only a little air can reach it. The volatile  gases burn more readily than the carbon, and are the first substances to  be driven off, so that the carbon is left behind nearly pure. In the same  way we have driven off all the gases from the half-burned match and left  the carbon. The teacher should have a piece of charcoal to show the  pupils. It still retains all the markings of the wood.    If the combustion is continued, the carbon also unites with the oxygen of  the air, till it is all converted into carbonic acid gas. This was the  case with the match where we left the glowing spark. The gray ash that was  left behind is the mineral matter contained in the wood.    (7) We can show that this gas is formed by pouring lime water into a  bottle in which a candle has been burned as in (2). The water becomes  milky from a fine white powder formed by the union of the carbonic acid  gas with the lime, forming carbonate of lime. This is a chemical test.    The wood of the match is plainly of vegetable origin; so also is the  charcoal, which is nearly pure carbon. Coal is also carbon, the remains of  ancient forests, from which the gases have been slowly driven off by heat  and pressure. All the common fuels are composed principally of carbon and  hydrogen. When these elements unite with oxygen, carbonic acid gas and  water are formed.[1]    [Footnote 1: [Transcriber's Note: This note is missing from original  text.]]    (8) The same products are formed by respiration. We breathe out carbonic  acid gas and water from our lungs. Breathe on a cold glass. It is bedewed  exactly as it is by the candle flame. Breathe through a bit of glass  tubing into a bottle of lime water. It becomes milky, showing the presence  of carbonic acid gas. Why is this?    Every act or thought is accompanied by a consumption of material in the  body, which thus becomes unfit for further use. These waste substances,  composed chiefly of carbon and hydrogen, unite with oxygen breathed in  from the air, forming carbonic acid gas and water, which are breathed  out of the system. The action is a process of slow combustion, and it is  principally by the heat thus evolved that the body is kept warm. As we are  thus constantly taking oxygen from the air, a close room becomes unfit to  live in and a supply of fresh air is indispensable. The cycle of changes  is completed by the action of plants, which take in carbonic acid gas, use  the carbon, and return most of the oxygen to the atmosphere.
