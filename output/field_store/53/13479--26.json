When a nest of these creatures is disturbed, however great their  own danger, the care they take of their offspring is remarkable: each  takes in its foreceps, a young one, often larger than itself and carries  it off.    These little insects form to themselves, with much industry and  application, of earth, sticks, leaves, &c. little hillocks, called  ant-hills, in the form of a cone: in these, they dwell, breed, and  deposite their stores: they are commonly built in woody places: the  brushy plains on Long-Island abound with them: they are from one to two  feet in height.          HONEY-BEE.    [Illustration]      This is an extraordinary, curious, and remarkably industrious little  insect, to which mankind are indebted for one of the most palatable and  wholesome sweets which nature affords; and which was one of the choice  articles with which the promised land was said to abound.    In every hive of bees, there are three kinds; the queen, the drones,  and the labourers: of these last, there are by far the greatest number:  and as cold weather approaches, they drive from the hives and destroy  the drones, that have not laboured in summer, and will not let them eat  in winter. If bees are examined through a glass hive, all appears at  first like confusion: but, on a more careful inspection, every animal is  found regularly employed. It is very delightful, when the maple and  other trees are in bloom, or the clover in the meadows, to be abroad and  hear their busy hum.      \"Brisk as the busy bee among learning's flowers.    Employ thy youthful sunshine hours.\"          DRAGON FLY.    [Illustration]      Of these flies, which are called by many Spindles, there are various  species. They all have two very large eyes, covering the whole surface  of the head. They fly very swiftly, and prey upon the wing, clearing the  air of innumerable little flies. The great ones live about water, but  the smaller are common among hedges, and about gardens.          BUTTERFLY.    [Illustration]      Of butterflies there are many kinds. How wonderful the various changes  of this class of insects! The butterflies lay their eggs: from these  hatch out worms or caterpillars, which change their skins several times,  and, finally, become aureliae, chrysales, or silkworms, out of which  come the beautiful butterflies.          SPIDER.    [Illustration]      There are many kinds of spiders; some of which are said to grow to such  a size that they will catch small birds: some are poisonous, but the  greater part are harmless, although to most people their looks are  disgusting. The web of a spider, which is a net for catching its prey,  is an astonishing piece of curiosity.          SILK WORM    [Transcriber's Note: The heading 'SILK WORM' was added in order to  improve clarity.]    [Illustration]    The silk worm is a very valuable insect: it is produced from an egg of a  yellowish colour, about the size of a small pin's head, that is laid by  a moth, or butterfly. The above cut represents a male and female, and  her eggs, of which she lays several hundreds: the moths live but a few  days; they never eat, and die directly after the eggs are laid.    [Illustration]    This cut shews the appearance of the worm, which at first is very small  and black. Its food is the leaves of the white mulberry: as it grows in  size, at four different periods, it apparently sickens, and changes its  skin, and finally, when full grown, it spins a ball of silk, called a  cone, or cocoon, the thread of which is about three hundred yards long:  in the centre of this ball the worm entombs itself, and experiences a  change to a state called an aurelia, or chrysallis, as seen below the  ball: from this aurelia, the moth that lays the eggs is hatched, and  thus goes on the round of this animal's changes, or transmigrations.    They are natives of China, and were brought into Italy, above twelve  hundred years ago; from thence into Spain; afterwards into France; much  later into Germany and the northern countries; and some have been reared  in the United States of America.          SAMUEL WOOD      Hereby informs the good little Boys and Girls, both of city and country,  who love to read better than to play, that if they will please to call  at his JUVENILE BOOK-STORE, NO. 357, Pearl-street, New-York, it will be  his pleasure to furnish them with a great variety of pretty little  books, with neat nuts, calculated to afford to the young mind pleasing  and useful information. Besides many from Philadelphia, New Haven, and  elsewhere, he has nearly fifty kinds of his own printing, and proposes  to enlarge the number.

For those bodies, from their own nature, must be subject to  chemical changes of a very violent nature; add to this, that from the  smallness of their dimensions, a fragment projected from them with a  very slight velocity would never return to the mass to which it  originally belonged; but would traverse the celestial regions till it  met with some planetary or other body sufficiently ponderous to attract  it to itself.    We have numerous other instances of these phenomena, which are attested  by many very credible witnesses, but I will not at present monopolize  more of your valuable pages with this subject, though one of  considerable interest; yet I may, perhaps, at some future period, if  agreeable, send you a few rather more circumstantial and more  interesting accounts than the above.    _Near Sheffield._    J.M.C----D.             *       *       *       *       *    THE POET, CHATTERTON.    _(To the Editor of the Mirror.)_      Should the following notice of Chatterton, which I copy from a _small  handkerchief_ in my possession, be thought worthy of a place in the  MIRROR, you will oblige me by inserting it. The handkerchief has been in  my possession about twenty-five years, and was probably printed soon  after the poet's death; he is represented sitting at a table, writing,  in a miserable apartment; behind him the bed turned up, &c.    SUFFOLK.      _The Distressed Poet, or a true representation of the unfortunate  Chatterton._    The painting from which the engraving was taken of the distressed poet,  was the work of a friend of the unfortunate Chatterton. This friend drew  him in the situation in which he is represented in this plate. Anxieties  and cares had advanced his life, and given him an older look than was  suited to his age. The sorry apartment portrayed in the print, the  folded bed, the broken utensil below it, the bottle, the farthing  candle, and the disorderly raiment of the bard, are not inventions of  fancy. They were realities; and a satire upon an age and a nation of  which generosity is doubtless a conspicuous characteristic. But poor  Chatterton was born under a bad star: his passions were too impetuous,  and in a distracted moment he deprived himself of an existence, which  his genius, and the fostering care of the public would undoubtedly have  rendered comfortable and happy. Unknown and miserable while alive, he  now calls forth curiosity and attention. Men of wit and learning employ  themselves to celebrate his talents, and to express their approbation of  his writings. Hard indeed was his fate, born to adorn the times in which  he lived, yet compelled to fall a victim to pride and poverty! His  destiny, cruel as it was, gives a charm to his verses; and while the  bright thought excites admiration, the recollection of his miseries  awakens a tender sympathy and sorrow. Who would not wish that he had  been so fortunate as to relieve a fellow creature so accomplished, from  wretchedness, despair, and suicide?      WRITTEN ON VIEWING THE PORTRAIT OF CHATTERTON.      Ah! what a contrast in that face portray'd,    Where care and study cast alternate shade;    But view it well, and ask thy heart the cause,    Then chide, with honest warmth, that cold applause    Which counteracts the fostering breath of praise,    And shades with cypress the young poet's bays:    Pale and dejected, mark, how genius strives    With poverty, and mark, how well it thrives;    The shabby cov'ring of the gentle bard,    Regard it well, 'tis worthy thy regard,    The friendly cobweb, serving for a screen,    The chair, a part of what it once had been;    The bed, whereon th' unhappy victim slept    And oft unseen, in silent anguish, wept,    Or spent in dear delusive dreams, the night,    To wake, next morning, but to curse the light,    Too deep distress the artist's hand reveals;    But like a friend's the black'ning deed conceals;    Thus justice, to mild complacency bends,    And candour, all harsh influence, suspends.    Enthron'd, supreme in judgment, mercy sits,    And, in one breath condemns, applauds, acquits:    Whoe'er thou art, that shalt this face survey,    And turn, with cold disgust, thine eyes away.    Then bless thyself, that sloth and ignorance bred    Thee up in safety, and with plenty fed,    Peace to thy mem'ry! may the sable plume    Of dulness, round thy forehead ever bloom;    May'st thou, nor can I wish a greater curse;    Live full despis'd, and die without a nurse;    Or, if same wither'd hag, for sake of hire,    Should wash thy sheets, and cleanse thee from the mire,    Let her, when hunger peevishly demands    The dainty morsel from her barb'rous hands,    Insult, with hellish mirth, thy craving maw    And snatch it to herself, and call it law,    Till pinching famine waste thee to the bone    And break, at last, that solid heart of stone.             *       *       *       *       *    LAY OF THE WANDERING ARAB.        \"Away, away, my barb and I,\"      As free as wave, as fleet as wind,    We sweep the sands of Araby,      And leave a world of slaves behind.      'Tis mine to range in this wild garb,      Nor e'er feel lonely though alone;    I would not change my Arab barb,      To mount a drowsy Sultan's throne.      Where the pale stranger dares not come,      Proud o'er my native sands I rove;    An Arab tent my only home,      An Arab maid my only love.      Here freedom dwells without a fear--      Coy to the world, she loves the wild;    Whoever brings a fetter here,      To chain the desert's fiery child.      What though the Frank may name with scorn,      Our barren clime, our realm of sand,    There were our thousand fathers born--      Oh, who would scorn his father's land?      It is not sands that form a waste,      Nor laughing fields a happy clime;    The spot, the most by Freedom graced,      Is where a man feels most sublime!      \"Away, away, my barb and I.\"      As free as wave as fleet as wind,    We sweep the sands of Araby,      And leave a world of slaves behind!             *       *       *       *       *    NOSTALGIA--MALADIE DE PAYS--CALENTURE.    _(For the Mirror.)_      This disease, according to Dr. Darwin, is an unconquerable desire of  returning to one's native country, frequent in long voyages, in which  the patients become so insane, as to throw themselves into the sea,  mistaking it for green fields or meadows:--      \"So, by a _calenture_ misled,      The mariner with rapture sees,    On the smooth ocean's azure bed,      Enamell'd fields and verdant trees.    With eager haste he longs to rove      In that fantastic scene, and thinks    It must be some enchanting grove,      And in he leaps, and down he sinks.\"    SWIFT.      The Swiss are said to be particularly liable to this disease, and when  taken into foreign service, frequently to desert from this cause, and  especially after hearing or singing a particular tune, which was used in  their village dances, in their native country, on which account the  playing or singing this tune was forbidden by the punishment of death.      \"Dear is that shed, to which his soul conforms,    And dear that hill, which lifts him to the storms.\"    GOLDSMITH.      Rousseau says, \"The celebrated Swiss tune, called the _Rans des Vaches_,  is an air, so dear to the Swiss, that it was forbidden under the pain of  death to play it to the troops, as it immediately drew tears from them,  and made those who heard it desert, or die of what is called _la maladie  de pays_, so ardent a desire did it excite to return to their native  country. It is in vain to seek in this air for energetic accents capable  of producing such astonishing effects, for which strangers are unable to  account from the music, which is in itself uncouth and wild. But it is  from habit, recollections, and a thousand circumstances retraced in this  tune by those natives who hear it, and reminding them of their country,  former pleasures of their youth, and all those ways of living, which  occasion a bitter reflection at having lost them. Music, then, does not  affect them as music, but as a reminiscence. This air, though always  the same, no longer produces the same effects at present as it did upon  the Swiss formerly; for having lost their taste for their first  simplicity, they no longer regret its loss when reminded of it. So true  it is, that we must not seek in physical causes the great effects of  sound upon the human heart.\"    This disease (says Dr. Winterbottom) affects the natives of Africa as  strongly as it does those of Switzerland; it is even more violent in its  effects on the Africans, and often impels them to dreadful acts of  suicide. Sometimes it plunges them into a deep melancholy, which induces  the unhappy sufferers to end a miserable existence by a more tedious,  though equally certain method, that of dirt eating.    Such is the powerful influence of the lore of one's native country.    P.T.W.             *       *       *       *       *    SINGULAR CUSTOM OF THE SULTAN OF TURKEY.    _(For the Mirror.)_      After the opening of the Bairam,[2] a ceremony among the Turks, attended  with more than ordinary magnificence; the Sultan, accompanied by the  Grand Signior and all the principal officers of state, goes to exhibit  himself to the people in a kiosk, or tent near the seraglio point,  seated on a sofa of silver, brought out for the occasion. It is a very  large, wooden couch covered with thick plates of massive silver, highly  burnished, and there is little doubt from the form of it, and the style  in which it is ornamented that it constituted part of the treasury of  the Greek emperors when Constantinople was taken by the Turks.
