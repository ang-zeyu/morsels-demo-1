I was thinking  of the manner in which the Romans, who are accustomed to besiege  places with high walls and strong gates, proceed. They have made  these matters a study, while to us an attack upon such a place is  altogether new, seeing that none such exist in Britain save those  the Romans have erected.\"    \"How would they proceed, Beric?\"    \"They would treat an attack upon such a place as a serious matter,  not to be undertaken rashly and hastily, but only after great  preparation. In order to batter down a gate or a wall they use  heavy beams, such as those that have been prepared for tomorrow,  but they affix to the head a shoe of iron or brass. They do not  swing it upon men's arms, seeing that it would be most difficult  to get so many men to exercise their strength together, and indeed  could not give it the momentum required.\"    \"But we propose to have the beam carried by fifty men, and for all  to rush forward together and drive it against the door.\"    \"If the door were weak and would yield to the first blow that might  avail,\" Beric said; \"but unless it does so the shock will throw  down the tree and the men bearing it. Many will be grievously hurt.  Moreover, if, as will surely be the case, many of the bearers fall  under the darts of the Romans as they approach, others will stumble  over their bodies, and the speed of the whole be greatly checked.\"    \"Then can you tell me how the Romans act in such a case, Beric?\"    \"Yes, sir. I have frequently heard relations of sieges from soldiers  who have taken part in them. They build, in the first place, movable  towers or sheds running on wheels. These towers are made strong  enough to resist the stones and missiles the besieged may hurl  against them. Under cover of the shelter men push up the towers to  the door or wall to be battered; the beam is then slung on ropes  hanging from the inside of the tower. Other ropes are attached;  numbers of men take hold of these, and working together swing the  beam backwards and forwards, so that each time it strikes the wall  or door a heavy blow. As the beam is of great weight, and many men  work it, the blows are well nigh irresistible, and the strongest  walls crumble and the most massive gates splinter under the shock  of its iron head.\"    \"The Romans truly are skilled warriors,\" Aska said. \"We are but  children in the art of war beside them, and methinks it would be  difficult indeed for us to construct such a machine, though mayhap  it could be done had we with us many men skilled in the making of  chariots. But sometimes, Beric, they must have occasion to attack  places where such machines could not well be used.\"    \"In that case, sir, they sometimes make what they call a tortoise.  The soldiers link their broad shields together, so as to form  a complete covering, resembling the back of a tortoise, and under  shelter of this they advance to the attack. When they reach the  foot of the wall all remain immovable save those in the front line,  who labour with iron bars to loosen the stones at the foot of the  wall, protected from missiles from above by the shields of their  comrades. From time to time they are relieved by fresh workers  until the foundations of the wall are deeply undermined. As they  proceed they erect massive props to keep up the wall, and finally  fill up the hole with combustibles. After lighting these they  retire. When the props are consumed the wall of course falls, and  they then rush forward and climb the breach.\"    \"Truly, Beric, you have profited by your lessons,\" Aska said, laying  his hand kindly on the lad's shoulder. \"The Druids spoke wisely  when they prophesied a great future for you. Before we have done we  may have many Roman strongholds to capture, and when we do I will  see that the council order that your advice be taken as to how they  shall be attacked; but in this matter tomorrow things must remain  as they are. Unser is a proud chief, and headstrong, and would  not brook any interference. Should he be repulsed in the assault,  I will advise the queen to call up the Sarci, and allow you to  proceed in your own manner.\"    \"I will do my best, sir; but time is needed for proceeding according  to the first Roman method, and our shields are too small for the  second. The place should be taken by tomorrow night, for Cerealis  will assuredly move with his legion to relieve it as soon as he  hears the news of our attack.\"    \"That is what has been in our minds,\" Aska said. \"Well, what do  you say, Beric? After what I saw the other day of the movements  you have taught your tribe I should be sorry to have their ranks  thinned in a hopeless attack upon the temple. I would rather that  we should leave it for the present and march out to meet Cerealis,  leaving a guard here to keep the Romans hemmed in until we have  time to deal with them.\"    Beric stood for a minute or two without answering, and then said,  \"I will undertake it, sir, with the Sarci should Unser's attack  fail.\"        CHAPTER VI: FIRST SUCCESSES      Upon leaving his mother, Beric returned to the spot where the Sarci  were lying. Some of the chiefs were sitting round a fire made of  beams and woodwork dragged from the ruins of the Roman houses.    \"We must be up an hour before daybreak; I think that there will  be work for us tomorrow. If Unser and his tribe fail in capturing  the temple we are to try; and there will be preparations to make.\"  And he explained the plan upon which he had determined.    Daylight was just breaking when the Sarci entered the forest four  miles from Camalodunum. Here they scattered in search of dry wood.  In two hours sufficient had been gathered for their purpose, and it  was made up into two hundred great faggots nearly four feet across  and ten in length, in weight as much as a strong man could carry  on his head. With these they returned to the city. It needed no  questions as to the result of the attack, which had just terminated  with the same fortune that had befallen that on the day previous.  Unser had been killed, and large numbers of his men had fallen in  their vain attempts to hew down the gates. The battering rams had  proved a complete failure. Many of the fifty men who carried the  beam had fallen as they advanced. The others had rushed at the gate  door, but the recoil had thrown them down, and many had had their  limbs broken from the tree falling on them. Attempts had been made  to repeat the assault; but the Romans having pierced the under  part of the roof in many places, let fall javelins and poured down  boiling oil; and at last, having done all that was possible, but  in vain, the tribesmen had fallen back.    Beric proceeded at once to the queen's. A council was being held,  and it had just been determined to march away to meet Cerealis when  Beric entered. Aska left his place in the circle of chiefs as soon  as he saw him enter the door.    \"Are you ready to undertake it, Beric? Do not do so unless you have  strong hopes of success. The repulses of yesterday and today have  lowered the spirits of our men, and another failure would still  further harm us.\"    \"I will undertake it, Aska, and I think I can answer for success;  but I shall need three hours before I begin.\"    \"That could be spared,\" the chief said. \"Cerealis will not have  learned the news until last night at the earliest--he may not  know it yet. There is no fear of his arriving here until tomorrow.\"  Then he returned to his place.    \"Before we finally decide, queen,\" he said, \"I would tell you that  the young chief Beric is ready to attack the place with the Sarci.  He has learned much of the Roman methods, and may be more fortunate  than the others have been. I would suggest that he be allowed to  try, for it will have a very ill effect upon the tribes if we fail  in taking the temple, which is regarded as the symbol of Roman  dominion. I will even go so far as to say that a retreat now would  go very far to mar our hopes of success in the war, for the news  would spread through the country and dispirit others now preparing  to join us.\"    \"Why should Beric succeed when Unser has failed?\" one of the chiefs  said. \"Can a lad achieve a success where one of our best and bravest  chiefs has been repulsed?\"    \"I think that he might,\" Aska replied. \"At any rate, as he is ready  to risk his life and his tribe in doing so, I pray the queen to  give her consent. He demands three hours to make his preparations  for the attack.\"    \"He shall try,\" Boadicea said decidedly. \"You saw the other day,  chiefs, how well he has learned the Roman methods of war. He shall  have an opportunity now of turning his knowledge to account. Parta,  you are willing that your son should try?\"    \"Certainly I am willing,\" Parta said. \"He can but die once; he  cannot die in a nobler effort for his country.\"    \"Then it is settled,\" the queen said. \"The Sarci will attack in  three hours.\"    As soon as Beric heard the decision he hurried away and at once  ordered the tribesmen to scatter through the country and to kill  two hundred of the cattle roaming at present masterless, to strip  off their hides, and bring them in. They returned before the three  hours expired, bringing in the hides. In the meantime Beric had  procured from a half consumed warehouse a quantity of oil, pitch,  and other combustibles, and had smeared the faggots with them. On  the arrival of the men with the hides, these were bound with the  raw side upwards over the faggots.    Two hundred of the strongest men of the tribe were then chosen and  divided into two parties,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#19)"],[1," the way to the court\"; and five minutes sufficed to produce a  brisk, fresh-colored, resolute-looking man, with a very confident,  rather festive air, and black eyes that opened wide at the sight of  Raffles.    \"Mr.--Glasspool?\" exclaimed the lawyer.    \"My name,\" said Raffles, with dry effrontery.    \"Not up at Lord's, however!\" said the other, slyly.  \"My dear sir, I  have seen you take far too many wickets to make any mistake!\"    For a single moment Raffles looked venomous; then he shrugged and  smiled, and the smile grew into a little cynical chuckle.    \"So you have bowled me out in my turn?\" said he.  \"Well, I don't think  there's anything to explain.  I am harder up than I wished to admit  under my own name, that's all, and I want that thousand pounds reward.\"    \"Two thousand,\" said the solicitor.  \"And the man who is not above an  alias happens to be just the sort of man I want; so don't let that  worry you, my dear sir.  The matter, however, is of a strictly private  and confidential character.\"  And he looked very hard at me.    \"Quite so,\" said Raffles.  \"But there was something about a risk?\"    \"A certain risk is involved.\"    \"Then surely three heads will be better than two.  I said I wanted that  thousand pounds; my friend here wants the other.  We are both cursedly  hard up, and we go into this thing together or not at all.  Must you  have his name too?  I should give him my real one, Bunny.\"    Mr. Addenbrooke raised his eyebrows over the card I found for him; then  he drummed upon it with his finger-nail, and his embarrassment  expressed itself in a puzzled smile.    \"The fact is, I find myself in a difficulty,\" he confessed at last.  \"Yours is the first reply I have received; people who can afford to  send long telegrams don't rush to the advertisements in the Daily  Telegraph; but, on the other hand, I was not quite prepared to hear  from men like yourselves.  Candidly, and on consideration, I am not  sure that you ARE the stamp of men for me--men who belong to good  clubs!  I rather intended to appeal to the--er--adventurous classes.\"    \"We are adventurers,\" said Raffles gravely.    \"But you respect the law?\"    The black eyes gleamed shrewdly.    \"We are not professional rogues, if that's what you mean,\" said  Raffles, smiling.  \"But on our beam-ends we are; we would do a good  deal for a thousand pounds apiece, eh, Bunny?\"    \"Anything,\" I murmured.    The solicitor rapped his desk.    \"I'll tell you what I want you to do.  You can but refuse.  It's  illegal, but it's illegality in a good cause; that's the risk, and my  client is prepared to pay for it.  He will pay for the attempt, in case  of failure; the money is as good as yours once you consent to run the  risk.  My client is Sir Bernard Debenham, of Broom Hall, Esher.\"    \"I know his son,\" I remarked.    Raffles knew him too, but said nothing, and his eye drooped disapproval  in my direction.  Bennett Addenbrooke turned to me.    \"Then,\" said he, \"you have the privilege of knowing one of the most  complete young black-guards about town, and the fons et origo of the  whole trouble.  As you know the son, you may know the father too, at  all events by reputation; and in that case I needn't tell you that he  is a very peculiar man.  He lives alone in a storehouse of treasures  which no eyes but his ever behold.  He is said to have the finest  collection of pictures in the south of England, though nobody ever sees  them to judge; pictures, fiddles and furniture are his hobby, and he is  undoubtedly very eccentric. Nor can one deny that there has been  considerable eccentricity in his treatment of his son.  For years Sir  Bernard paid his debts, and the other day, without the slightest  warning, not only refused to do so any more, but absolutely stopped the  lad's allowance.  Well, I'll tell you what has happened; but first of  all you must know, or you may remember, that I appeared for young  Debenham in a little scrape he got into a year or two ago.  I got him  off all right, and Sir Bernard paid me handsomely on the nail.  And no  more did I hear or see of either of them until one day last week.\"    The lawyer drew his chair nearer ours, and leant forward with a hand on  either knee.    \"On Tuesday of last week I had a telegram from Sir Bernard; I was to go  to him at once.  I found him waiting for me in the drive; without a  word he led me to the picture-gallery, which was locked and darkened,  drew up a blind, and stood simply pointing to an empty picture-frame.  It was a long time before I could get a word out of him.  Then at last  he told me that that frame had contained one of the rarest and most  valuable pictures in England--in the world--an original Velasquez.  I  have checked this,\" said the lawyer, \"and it seems literally true; the  picture was a portrait of the Infanta Maria Teresa, said to be one of  the artist's greatest works, second only to another portrait of one of  the Popes in Rome--so they told me at the National Gallery, where they  had its history by heart.  They say there that the picture is  practically priceless.  And young Debenham has sold it for five  thousand pounds!\"    \"The deuce he has,\" said Raffles.    I inquired who had bought it.    \"A Queensland legislator of the name of Craggs--the Hon. John Montagu  Craggs, M.L.C., to give him his full title.  Not that we knew anything  about him on Tuesday last; we didn't even know for certain that young  Debenham had stolen the picture.  But he had gone down for money on the  Monday evening, had been refused, and it was plain enough that he had  helped himself in this way; he had threatened revenge, and this was it.  Indeed, when I hunted him up in town on the Tuesday night, he confessed  as much in the most brazen manner imaginable.  But he wouldn't tell me  who was the purchaser, and finding out took the rest of the week; but I  did find out, and a nice time I've had of it ever since!  Backwards and  forwards between Esher and the MÃ©tropole, where the Queenslander is  staying, sometimes twice a day; threats, offers, prayers, entreaties,  not one of them a bit of good!\"    \"But,\" said Raffles, \"surely it's a clear case?  The sale was illegal;  you can pay him back his money and force him to give the picture up.\"    \"Exactly; but not without an action and a public scandal, and that my  client declines to face.  He would rather lose even his picture than  have the whole thing get into the papers; he has disowned his son, but  he will not disgrace him; yet his picture he must have by hook or  crook, and there's the rub!  I am to get it back by fair means or foul.  He gives me carte blanche in the matter, and, I verily believe, would  throw in a blank check if asked.  He offered one to the Queenslander,  but Craggs simply tore it in two; the one old boy is as much a  character as the other, and between the two of them I'm at my wits'  end.\"    \"So you put that advertisement in the paper?\" said Raffles, in the dry  tones he had adopted throughout the interview.    \"As a last resort.  I did.\"    \"And you wish us to STEAL this picture?\"    It was magnificently said; the lawyer flushed from his hair to his  collar.    \"I knew you were not the men!\" he groaned. \"I never thought of men of  your stamp!  But it's not stealing,\" he exclaimed heatedly; \"it's  recovering stolen property.  Besides, Sir Bernard will pay him his five  thousand as soon as he has the picture; and, you'll see, old Craggs  will be just as loath to let it come out as Sir Bernard himself.  No,  no--it's an enterprise, an adventure, if you like--but not stealing.\"    \"You yourself mentioned the law,\" murmured Raffles.    \"And the risk,\" I added.    \"We pay for that,\" he said once more.    \"But not enough,\" said Raffles, shaking his head.  \"My good sir,  consider what it means to us.  You spoke of those clubs; we should not  only get kicked out of them, but put in prison like common burglars!  It's true we're hard up, but it simply isn't worth it at the price.  Double your stakes, and I for one am your man.\"    Addenbrooke wavered.    \"Do you think you could bring it off?\"    \"We could try.\"    \"But you have no--\"    \"Experience?  Well, hardly!\"    \"And you would really run the risk for four thousand pounds?\"    Raffles looked at me.  I nodded.    \"We would,\" said he, \"and blow the odds!\"    \"It's more than I can ask my client to pay,\" said Addenbrooke, growing  firm.    \"Then it's more than you can expect us to risk.\"    \"You are in earnest?\"    \"God wot!\"    \"Say three thousand if you succeed!\"    \"Four is our figure, Mr. Addenbrooke.\"    \"Then I think it should be nothing if you fail.\"    \"Doubles or quits?\" cried Raffles.  \"Well, that's sporting.  Done!\"    Addenbrooke opened his lips, half rose, then sat back in his chair, and  looked long and shrewdly at Raffles--never once at me.    \"I know your bowling,\" said he reflectively.  \"I go up to Lord's  whenever I want an hour's real rest, and I've seen you bowl again and  again--yes, and take the best wickets in England on a plumb pitch.  I  don't forget the last Gentleman and Players; I was there.  You're up to  every trick--every one ...  I'm inclined to think that if anybody could  bowl out this old Australian ...  Damme, I believe you're my very man!\"    The bargain was clinched at the CafÃ© Royal, where Bennett Addenbrooke  insisted on playing host at an extravagant luncheon.  I remember that  he took his whack of champagne with the nervous freedom of a man at  high pressure, and have no doubt I kept him in countenance by an equal  indulgence; but Raffles, ever an exemplar in such matters, was more  abstemious even than his wont, and very poor company to boot.  I can  see him now, his eyes in his plate--thinking--thinking.  I can see the  solicitor glancing from him to me in an apprehension of which I did my  best to disabuse him by reassuring looks.  At the close Raffles  apologized for his preoccupation, called for an A.B.C.  time-tabl"]]]
