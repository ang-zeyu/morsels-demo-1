Moreover, she  had discovered an island. On the charts this one that she had sailed  around was traced as a point of land. I named it Alan Erric Island,  after a worthy literary friend whom I had met in strange by-places,  and I put up a sign, \"Keep off the grass,\" which, as discoverer, was  within my rights.    Now at last the _Spray_ carried me free of Tierra del Fuego. If by a  close shave only, still she carried me clear, though her boom actually  hit the beacon rocks to leeward as she lugged on sail to clear the  point. The thing was done on the 13th of April, 1896. But a close  shave and a narrow escape were nothing new to the _Spray_.    The waves doffed their white caps beautifully to her in the strait  that day before the southeast wind, the first true winter breeze of  the season from that quarter, and here she was out on the first of it,  with every prospect of clearing Cape Pillar before it should shift. So  it turned out; the wind blew hard, as it always blows about Cape Horn,  but she had cleared the great tide-race off Cape Pillar and the  Evangelistas, the outermost rocks of all, before the change came. I  remained at the helm, humoring my vessel in the cross seas, for it was  rough, and I did not dare to let her take a straight course. It was  necessary to change her course in the combing seas, to meet them with  what skill I could when they rolled up ahead, and to keep off when  they came up abeam.    On the following morning, April 14, only the tops of the highest  mountains were in sight, and the _Spray_, making good headway on a  northwest course, soon sank these out of sight. \"Hurrah for the  _Spray_!\" I shouted to seals, sea-gulls, and penguins; for there were  no other living creatures about, and she had weathered all the dangers  of Cape Horn. Moreover, she had on her voyage round the Horn salved a  cargo of which she had not jettisoned a pound. And why should not one  rejoice also in the main chance coming so of itself?    I shook out a reef, and set the whole jib, for, having sea-room, I  could square away two points. This brought the sea more on her  quarter, and she was the wholesomer under a press of sail.  Occasionally an old southwest sea, rolling up, combed athwart her, but  did no harm. The wind freshened as the sun rose half-mast or more, and  the air, a bit chilly in the morning, softened later in the day; but I  gave little thought to such things as these.    One wave, in the evening, larger than others that had threatened all  day,--one such as sailors call \"fine-weather seas,\"-broke over the  sloop fore and aft. It washed over me at the helm, the last that swept  over the _Spray_ off Cape Horn. It seemed to wash away old regrets.  All my troubles were now astern; summer was ahead; all the world was  again before me. The wind was even literally fair. My \"trick\" at the  wheel was now up, and it was 5 p.m. I had stood at the helm since  eleven o'clock the morning before, or thirty hours.    Then was the time to uncover my head, for I sailed alone with God. The  vast ocean was again around me, and the horizon was unbroken by land.  A few days later the _Spray_ was under full sail, and I saw her for  the first time with a jigger spread, This was indeed a small incident,  but it was the incident following a triumph. The wind was still  southwest, but it had moderated, and roaring seas had turned to  gossiping waves that rippled and pattered against her sides as she  rolled among them, delighted with their story. Rapid changes went on,  those days, in things all about while she headed for the tropics. New  species of birds came around; albatrosses fell back and became scarcer  and scarcer; lighter gulls came in their stead, and pecked for crumbs  in the sloop's wake.    On the tenth day from Cape Pillar a shark came along, the first of its  kind on this part of the voyage to get into trouble. I harpooned him  and took out his ugly jaws. I had not till then felt inclined to take  the life of any animal, but when John Shark hove in sight my sympathy  flew to the winds. It is a fact that in Magellan I let pass many ducks  that would have made a good stew, for I had no mind in the lonesome  strait to take the life of any living thing.    From Cape Pillar I steered for Juan Fernandez, and on the 26th of  April, fifteen days out, made that historic island right ahead.    The blue hills of Juan Fernandez, high among the clouds, could be seen  about thirty miles off. A thousand emotions thrilled me when I saw the  island, and I bowed my head to the deck. We may mock the Oriental  salaam, but for my part I could find no other way of expressing  myself.    The wind being light through the day, the _Spray_ did not reach the  island till night. With what wind there was to fill her sails she  stood close in to shore on the northeast side, where it fell calm and  remained so all night. I saw the twinkling of a small light farther  along in a cove, and fired a gun, but got no answer, and soon the  light disappeared altogether. I heard the sea booming against the  cliffs all night, and realized that the ocean swell was still great,  although from the deck of my little ship it was apparently small. From  the cry of animals in the hills, which sounded fainter and fainter  through the night, I judged that a light current was drifting the  sloop from the land, though she seemed all night dangerously near the  shore, for, the land being very high, appearances were deceptive.    [Illustration: The _Spray_ approaching Juan Fernandez, Robinson  Crusoe's Island.]    Soon after daylight I saw a boat putting out toward me. As it pulled  near, it so happened that I picked up my gun, which was on the deck,  meaning only to put it below; but the people in the boat, seeing the  piece in my hands, quickly turned and pulled back for shore, which was  about four miles distant. There were six rowers in her, and I observed  that they pulled with oars in oar-locks, after the manner of trained  seamen, and so I knew they belonged to a civilized race; but their  opinion of me must have been anything but flattering when they mistook  my purpose with the gun and pulled away with all their might. I made  them understand by signs, but not without difficulty, that I did not  intend to shoot, that I was simply putting the piece in the cabin, and  that I wished them to return. When they understood my meaning they  came back and were soon on board.    One of the party, whom the rest called \"king,\" spoke English; the  others spoke Spanish. They had all heard of the voyage of the _Spray_  through the papers of Valparaiso, and were hungry for news concerning  it. They told me of a war between Chile and the Argentine, which I had  not heard of when I was there. I had just visited both countries, and  I told them that according to the latest reports, while I was in  Chile, their own island was sunk. (This same report that Juan  Fernandez had sunk was current in Australia when I arrived there three  months later.)    I had already prepared a pot of coffee and a plate of doughnuts,  which, after some words of civility, the islanders stood up to and  discussed with a will, after which they took the _Spray_ in tow of  their boat and made toward the island with her at the rate of a good  three knots. The man they called king took the helm, and with whirling  it up and down he so rattled the _Spray_ that I thought she would  never carry herself straight again. The others pulled away lustily  with their oars. The king, I soon learned, was king only by courtesy.  Having lived longer on the island than any other man in the  world,--thirty years,--he was so dubbed. Juan Fernandez was then under  the administration of a governor of Swedish nobility, so I was told. I  was also told that his daughter could ride the wildest goat on the  island. The governor, at the time of my visit, was away at Valparaiso  with his family, to place his children at school. The king had been  away once for a year or two, and in Rio de Janeiro had married a  Brazilian woman who followed his fortunes to the far-off island. He  was himself a Portuguese and a native of the Azores. He had sailed in  New Bedford whale-ships and had steered a boat. All this I learned,  and more too, before we reached the anchorage. The sea-breeze, coming  in before long, filled the _Spray's_ sails, and the experienced  Portuguese mariner piloted her to a safe berth in the bay, where she  was moored to a buoy abreast the settlement.          CHAPTER XI      The islanders at Juan Fernandez entertained with Yankee doughnuts--The  beauties of Robinson Crusoe's realm--The mountain monument to  Alexander Selkirk--Robinson Crusoe's cave--A stroll with the children  of the island--Westward ho! with a friendly gale--A month's free  sailing with the Southern Cross and the sun for guides--Sighting the  Marquesas--Experience in reckoning.    The _Spray_ being secured, the islanders returned to the coffee and  doughnuts, and I was more than flattered when they did not slight my  buns, as the professor had done in the Strait of Magellan. Between  buns and doughnuts there was little difference except in name. Both  had been fried in tallow, which was the strong point in both, for  there was nothing on the island fatter than a goat, and a goat is but  a lean beast, to make the best of it. So with a view to business I  hooked my steelyards to the boom at once, ready to weigh out tallow,  there being no customs officer to say, \"Why do you do so?\" and before  the sun went down the islanders had learned the art of making buns and  doughnuts. I did not charge a high price for what I sold, but the  ancient and curious coins I got in payment, some of them from the  wreck of a galleon sunk in the bay no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#19)"],[1,"island of Cuba, in places where the thermometer descends to seven  centesimal degrees, and sometimes very near freezing point. In  Italy and Spain the orange and date-trees do not perish, though the  cold during the night may be two degrees below freezing point. In  general it is remarked by cultivators, that the trees which grow in  a fertile soil are less delicate, and consequently less affected by  great changes in the temperature, than those which grow in land  that affords but little nutriment.* (* The mulberries, cultivated  in the thin and sandy soils of countries bordering on the Baltic  Sea, are examples of this feebleness of organization. The late  frosts do more injury to them, than to the mulberries of Piedmont.  In Italy a cold of 5 degrees below freezing point does not destroy  robust orange trees. According to M. Galesio, these trees, less  tender than the lemon and bergamot orange trees, freeze only at ten  centesimal degrees below freezing point.)    In order to pass from the town of Laguna to the port of Orotava and  the western coast of Teneriffe, we cross at first a hilly region  covered with black and argillaceous earth, in which are found some  small crystals of pyroxene. The waters most probably detach these  crystals from the neighbouring rocks, as at Frascati, near Rome.  Unfortunately, strata of ferruginous earth conceal the soil from  the researches of the geologist. It is only in some ravines, that  we find columnar basalts, somewhat curved, and above them very  recent breccia, resembling volcanic tufa. The breccia contain  fragments of the same basalts which they cover; and it is asserted  that marine petrifactions are observed in them. The same phenomenon  occurs in the Vicentin, near Montechio Maggiore.    The valley of Tacoronte is the entrance into that charming country,  of which travellers of every nation have spoken with rapturous  enthusiasm. Under the torrid zone I found sites where nature is  more majestic, and richer in the display of organic forms; but  after having traversed the banks of the Orinoco, the Cordilleras of  Peru, and the most beautiful valleys of Mexico, I own that I have  never beheld a prospect more varied, more attractive, more  harmonious in the distribution of the masses of verdure and of  rocks, than the western coast of Teneriffe.    The sea-coast is lined with date and cocoa trees. Groups of the  musa, as the country rises, form a pleasing contrast with the  dragon-tree, the trunks of which have been justly compared to the  tortuous form of the serpent. The declivities are covered with  vines, which throw their branches over towering poles. Orange trees  loaded with flowers, myrtles, and cypress trees encircle the  chapels reared to devotion on the isolated hills. The divisions of  landed property are marked by hedges formed of the agave and the  cactus. An innumerable quantity of cryptogamous plants, among which  ferns are the most predominant, cover the walls, and are moistened  by small springs of limpid water. In winter, when the volcano is  buried under ice and snow, this district enjoys perpetual spring.  In summer, as the day declines, the breezes from the sea diffuse a  delicious freshness. The population of this coast is very  considerable; and it appears to be still greater than it is,  because the houses and gardens are distant from each other, which  adds to the picturesque beauty of the scene. Unhappily the real  welfare of the inhabitants does not correspond with the exertions  of their industry, or with the advantages which nature has lavished  on this spot. The farmers are not land-owners; the fruits of their  labour belong to the nobles; and those feudal institutions, which,  for so long a time, spread misery throughout Europe, still press  heavily on the people of the Canary Islands.    From Tegueste and Tacoronte to the village of St. Juan de la Rambla  (which is celebrated for its excellent malmsey wine), the rising  hills are cultivated like a garden. I might compare them to the  environs of Capua and Valentia, if the western part of Teneriffe  was not infinitely more beautiful on account of the proximity of  the peak, which presents on every side a new point of view. The  aspect of this mountain is interesting not merely from its gigantic  mass; it excites the mind, by carrying it back to the mysterious  source of its volcanic agency. For thousands of years, no flames or  light have been perceived on the summit of the Piton, nevertheless  enormous lateral eruptions, the last of which took place in 1798,  are proofs of the activity of a fire still far from being  extinguished. There is also something that leaves a melancholy  impression on beholding a crater in the centre of a fertile and  well cultivated country. The history of the globe informs us, that  volcanoes destroy what they have been a long series of ages in  creating. Islands, which the action of submarine fires has raised  above the waters, are by degrees clothed in rich and smiling  verdure; but these new lands are often laid waste by the renewed  action of the same power which caused them to emerge from the  bottom of the ocean. Islets, which are now but heaps of scoriae and  volcanic ashes, were once perhaps as fertile as the hills of  Tacoronte and Sauzal. Happy the country, where man has no distrust  of the soil on which he lives!    Pursuing our course to the port of Orotava, we passed the smiling  hamlets of Matanza and Victoria. These names are mingled together  in all the Spanish colonies, and they form an unpleasing contrast  with the peaceful and tranquil feelings which those countries  inspire. Matanza signifies slaughter, or carnage; and the word  alone recalls the price at which victory has been purchased. In the  New World it generally indicates the defeat of the natives: at  Teneriffe, the village of Matanza was built in a place* (* The  ancient Acantejo.) where the Spaniards were conquered by those same  Guanches who soon after were sold as slaves in the markets of  Europe.    Before we reached Orotava, we visited a botanic garden at a little  distance from the port. We there found M. Le Gros, the French  vice-consul, who had often scaled the summit of the Peak, and who  served us as an excellent guide. He was accompanying captain Baudin  in a voyage to the West Indies, when a dreadful tempest, of which  M. Le Dru has given an account in the narrative of his voyage to  Porto Rico, forced the vessel to put into Teneriffe. There M. Le  Gros was led by the beauty of the spot to settle. It was he who  augmented scientific knowledge by the first accurate ideas of the  great lateral eruption of the Peak, which has been very improperly  called the explosion of the volcano of Chahorra. This eruption took  place on the 8th of June, 1798.    The establishment of a botanical garden at Teneriffe is a very  happy idea, on account of the influence it is likely to have on the  progress of botany, and on the introduction of useful plants into  Europe. For the first conception of it we are indebted to the  Marquis de Nava. He undertook, at an enormous expense, to level the  hill of Durasno, which rises as an amphitheatre, and which was  begun to be planted in 1795. The marquis thought that the Canary  Islands, from the mildness of their climate and geographical  position, were the most suitable place for naturalising the  productions of the East and West Indies, and for inuring the plants  gradually to the colder temperature of the south of Europe. The  plants of Asia, Africa, and South America, may easily be brought to  Orotava; and in order to introduce the bark-tree* into Sicily,  Portugal, or Grenada, it should be first planted at Durasno, or at  Laguna, and the shoots of this tree may afterwards be transported  into Europe from the Canaries. (* I speak of the species of  bark-tree (cinchona), which at Peru, and in the kingdom of New  Granada, flourish on the back of the Cordilleras, at the height of  between 1000 and 1500 toises, in places where the thermometer is  between nine and ten degrees during the day, and from three to four  during the night. The orange bark-tree (Cinchona lancifolia) is  much less delicate than the red bark-tree (C. oblongifolia).) In  happier times, when maritime wars shall no longer interrupt  communication, the garden of Teneriffe may become extremely useful  with respect to the great number of plants which are sent from the  Indies to Europe; for ere they reach our coasts, they often perish,  owing to the length of the passage, during which they inhale an air  impregnated with salt water. These plants would meet at Orotava  with the care and climate necessary for their preservation. At  Durasno, the protea, the psidium, the jambos, the chirimoya of  Peru,* (* Annona cherimolia. Lamarck.) the sensitive plant, and the  heliconia, grow in the open air. We gathered the ripened seeds of  several beautiful species of glycine from New Holland, which the  governor of Cumana, Mr. Emparan, had successfully cultivated, and  which grow wild on the coasts of South America.    We arrived very late at the port of Orotava,* (* Puerto de la Cruz.  The only fine port of the Canary Islands is that of St. Sebastian,  in the isle of Gomara.) if we may give the name of port to a road  in which vessels are obliged to put to sea whenever the winds blow  violently from the north-west. It is impossible to speak of Orotava  without recalling to the remembrance of the friends of science the  name of Don Bernardo Cologan, whose house at all times was open to  travellers of every nation.    We could have wished to have sojourned for some time in Don  Bernardo's house, and to have visited with him the charming scenery  of St. Juan de la Rambla and of Rialexo de Abaxo.* (* This  last-named village stands at the foot of the lofty mountain of  Tygayga.) But on a voyage such as we had undertaken, the present is  but little enjoyed. Continually haunted by the"]]]
