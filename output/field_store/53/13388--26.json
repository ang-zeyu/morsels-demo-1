This assurance overcomes his obstinacy;  he leaves Lemnos in obedience to the will of Heaven.    Such is the work of an old dramatist well over eighty years old. It is  exciting, vigorous, pathetic and everywhere dignified. The characters  of the old hero and the young warrior are masterly. The Chorus takes an  integral part in the action--its whisperings to Neoptolemus remind  the reader of the evil suggestions of which Satan breathed into Eve's  equally guileless ears in _Paradise Lost_. But the most remarkable  feature of the piece is its close resemblance to the new type of drama  which Euripides had popularised. The miserable life of Philoctetes,  his rags, destitution and sickness are a parallel to the Euripidean  Telephus; most of all, the appearance of a god at the end to untie  the knot is genuine Euripides. But there is a great difference; of the  disjointed actions which disfigure later tragedy and are not absent from  Sophocles' own earlier work there is not a trace. The odes are relevant,  the Chorus is indispensable; in short, Sophocles has shown Euripides  that he can beat him even on his own terms. Melodramatic the play may  be, but it wins for its author our affection by the sheer beauty of a  boyish nature as noble as Deianeira's; the return of Neoptolemus upon  his own baseness is one of the many compliments Sophocles has paid to  our human kind.    Many years previously Sophocles had written his masterpiece, the  _Oedipus Tyrannus_. It cannot easily be treated separately from its  sequel. A mysterious plague had broken out in Thebes; Creon had been  sent to Delphi by Oedipus to learn the cause of the disaster. Apollo  bade the Thebans cast out the murderer of the last King Laius, who was  still lurking in Theban territory. Oedipus on inquiry learns that there  are several murderers, but only one of Laius' attendants escaped alive.  In discovering the culprit Oedipus promises the sternest vengeance on  his nearest friends, nay, on his own kin, if necessary. After a prayer  from the Chorus of elders he repeats his determination even more  emphatically, invoking a curse on the assassin in language of a terrible  double meaning, for in every word he utters he unconsciously pronounces  his own doom. With commendable foresight he had summoned the old seer  Teiresias, but the seer for some reason is unwilling to appear. When  at last he confronts the King, he craves permission to depart with his  secret unsaid. Oedipus at once flies into a towering passion, finally  accusing him without any justification of accepting bribes from Creon.  With equal heat Teiresias more and more clearly indicates in every  speech the real murderer, though his words are dark to him who could  read the Sphinx's riddle.    The Chorus break out into an ode full of uneasy surmises as to the  identity of the culprit. When Creon enters, Oedipus flies at him in  headlong passion accusing him of bribery, disloyalty and eventually of  murder. With great dignity he clears himself, warning the King of the  pains which hasty temper brings upon itself. Their quarrel brings out  Jocasta, the Queen and sister of Creon, who succeeds in settling the  unseemly strife. She bids Oedipus take no notice of oracles; one such  had declared that Laius would be slain by his own son, who would marry  her, his mother. The oracle was false, for Laius had died at the hands  of robbers in a place where three roads met. Aghast at hearing this,  Oedipus inquires the exact scene of the murder, the time when it was  committed, the actual appearance of Laius. Jocasta supplies the details,  adding that the one survivor had implored her after Oedipus became King  to live as far away as possible from the city. Oedipus commands him to  be sent for and tells his life story. He was the reputed son of Polybus  and Merope, rulers of Corinth. One day at a wine-party a man insinuated  that he was not really the son of the royal pair. Stung by the taunt he  went to Delphi, where he was warned that he should kill his father and  marry his mother. He therefore fled away from Corinth towards Thebes.  On the road he was insulted by an old man in a chariot who thrust him  rudely from his path; in anger he smote the man at the place where  three ways met. If then this man was Laius, he had imprecated a curse  on himself; his one hope is the solitary survivor whom he had sent for;  perhaps more than one man had killed Laius after all.    An ominous ode about destiny and its workings is followed by the entry  of the Queen who describes the mad terrors of Oedipus. She is come  to pray to Apollo to solve their troubles. At that moment a messenger  enters from Corinth with the tidings that Polybus is dead. In eager joy  Jocasta summons Oedipus, sneering at the truth of oracles. The King on  his appearance echoes her words after hearing the tidings-only to sink  back again into gloomy despondency. What of Merope, is she also dead?  The messenger assures him that his anxiety about her is groundless, for  there is no relationship between them. Little by little he tells Oedipus  his true history. The messenger himself found him on Cithaeron in his  infancy, his feet pierced through. He had him from a shepherd, a servant  of Laius, the very man whom Oedipus had summoned. Suddenly turning to  Jocasta, the King asks her if she knows the man. Appalled at the horror  of the truth which she knows cannot be concealed much longer she affects  indifference and beseeches him search no further. When he obstinately  refuses, bidding the man be brought at once, she leaves the stage with  the cry:        \"Alack, thou unhappy one; that is all I may call thee and never      address thee again.\"    Oedipus by a masterstroke of art is made to imagine that she has  departed in shame, fearing he may be proved the son of a slave.        \"But I account myself the son of Fortune, who will never bring me      to dishonour; my brethren are the months, who marked me out for      lowliness and for power. Such being my birth, I shall never prove      false to it and faint in finding out who I am.\"    The awful power of this astonishing scene is manifest.    The bright joyousness of the King's impulsive speech prepares the way  for the coming horror. When the shepherd appears, the messenger faces  him claiming his acquaintance. The shepherd doggedly attempts to deny  all knowledge of him, cursing him for his mad talkativeness. Oedipus  threatens torture to open his lips. Line by line the truth is dragged  from him; the abandoned child came from another--from a creature of  Laius--was said to be his son--was given him by Jocasta--to be  destroyed because of an oracle--why then passed over to the Corinthian  messenger?--\"through pity, and he saved the child alive, for a mighty  misery. If thou art that child, know that thou art born a hapless man\".    When the King rushes madly into the palace, the Chorus sings of his  departed glory. The horrors increase with the appearance of a messenger  from within, who tells how Oedipus dashed into Jocasta's apartment to  find her hanging in suicide; then he blinded himself on that day of  mourning, ruin, death and shame. He comes out a little later, an  object of utter compassion. How can he have rest on earth? How face his  murdered father in death? The memories of Polybus and Merope come upon  him, then the years of unnatural wedlock. Creon, whom he has wantonly  insulted, comes not to mock at him, but to take him into the palace  where neither land nor rain nor light may know him. Oedipus begs him  to let him live on Cithaeron, beseeching him to look after his two  daughters whose birth is so stained that no man can ever wed them. Creon  gently takes him within, to be kept there till the will of the gods is  known. The end is a sob of pity for the tragic downfall of the famous  man who solved the Sphinx' enigma.    No man can ever do justice to this masterpiece. It is so constructed  that every detail leads up inevitably to the climax. Slowly, and playing  upon all the deepest human emotions, anxiety, hope, gloom, terror and  horror, Sophocles works on us as no man had ever done before. It is a  sin against him to be content with a mere outline of the play; the words  he has chosen are significant beyond description. Again and again they  fascinate the reader and always leave him with the feeling that there  are still depths of thought left unsounded. The casual mention of the  shepherd at the beginning of the play is the first stroke of perfect  art; Jocasta's disbelief in oracles is the next; then follows the  contrast between the Queen's real motive for leaving and the reason  assigned to it by her son; finally, the shepherd in torture is forced  to tell the secret which plunges the torturer to his ruin. Where is the  like of this in literature? To us it is heart-searching enough. What was  it to the Greeks who were familiar with the plot before they entered the  theatre? When they who knew the inevitable end watched the King trace  out his own ruin in utter ignorance, their feelings cannot have remained  silent; they must have found relief in sobbing or crying aloud.    The fault in Oedipus is his ungovernable temper. It is firmly drawn in  the play; he is equally unrestrained in anger, despair and hope. He is  the typical instance of the lack of good counsel which we have seen was  to Sophocles the prime source of a tragedy. Indeed, only a headlong  man would hastily marry a widowed queen after he had committed a murder  which fulfilled one half of a terrible oracle. He should have first  inquired into the history of the Theban royal house. Imagining that the  further he was fleeing from Corinth the more certain he was to make his  doom impossible of fulfilment, he inevitably drew nearer to it.

When the hills called I used to go to them by road, riding a bicycle. If  you go by train you miss the gradual approach, you do not cast off London  like an old forgiven sin, nor pass by little villages on the way that must  have some rumour of the hills; nor, wondering if they are still the same,  come at last upon the edge of their far-spread robes, and so on to their  feet, and see far off their holy, welcoming faces. In the train you see  them suddenly round a curve, and there they all are sitting in the sun.    I imagine that as one penetrated out from some enormous forest of the  tropics, the wild beasts would become fewer, the gloom would lighten, and  the horror of the place would slowly lift. Yet as one emerges nearer to  the edge of London, and nearer to the beautiful influence of the hills,  the houses become uglier, the streets viler, the gloom deepens, the errors  of civilisation stand bare to the scorn of the fields.    Where ugliness reaches the height of its luxuriance, in the dense misery  of the place, where one imagines the builder saying, \"Here I culminate.  Let us give thanks to Satan,\" there is a bridge of yellow brick, and  through it, as through some gate of filigree silver opening on fairyland,  one passes into the country.    To left and right, as far as one can see, stretches that monstrous city;  before one are the fields like an old, old song.    There is a field there that is full of king-cups. A stream runs through  it, and along the stream is a little wood of osiers. There I used often to  rest at the streams edge before my long journey to the hills.    There I used to forget London, street by street. Sometimes I picked a  bunch of king-cups to show them to the hills.    I often came there. At first I noticed nothing about the field except its  beauty and its peacefulness.    But the second time that I came I thought there was something ominous  about the field.    Down there among the king-cups by the little shallow stream I felt that  something terrible might happen in just such a place.    I did not stay long there, because I thought that too much time spent in  London had brought on these morbid fancies and I went on to the hills as  fast as I could.    I stayed for some days in the country air, and when I came back I went to  the field again to enjoy that peaceful spot before entering London. But  there was still something ominous among the osiers.    A year elapsed before I went there again. I emerged from the shadow of  London into the gleaming sun; the bright green grass and the king-cups  were flaming in the light, and the little stream was singing a happy song.  But the moment I stepped into the field my old uneasiness returned, and  worse than before. It was as though the shadow was brooding there of some  dreadful future thing and a year had brought it nearer.    I reasoned that the exertion of bicycling might be bad for one, and that  the moment one rested this uneasiness might result.    A little later I came back past the field by night, and the song of the  stream in the hush attracted me down to it. And there the fancy came to me  that it would be a terribly cold place to be in the starlight, if for some  reason one was hurt and could not get away.    I knew a man who was minutely acquainted with the past history of that  locality, and him I asked if anything historical had ever happened in that  field. When he pressed me for my reason in asking him this, I said that  the field had seemed to me such a good place to hold a pageant in. But he  said that nothing of any interest had ever occurred there, nothing at all.    So it was from the future that the field's terrible trouble came.    For three years off and on I made visits to the field, and every time more  clearly it boded evil things, and my uneasiness grew more acute every time  that I was lured to go and rest among the cool green grass under the  beautiful osiers. Once to distract my thoughts I tried to gauge how fast  the stream was trickling, but I found myself wondering if it flowed faster  than blood.    I felt that it would be a terrible place to go mad in, one would hear  voices.    At last I went to a poet whom I knew, and woke him from huge dreams, and  put before him the whole case of the field. He had not been out of London  all that year, and he promised to come with me and look at the field, and  tell me what was going to happen there. It was late in July when we went.  The pavement, the air, the houses and the dirt had been all baked dry by  the summer, the weary traffic dragged on, and on, and on, and Sleep  spreading her wings soared up and floated from London and went to walk  beautifully in rural places.    When the poet saw the field he was delighted, the flowers were out in  masses all along the stream, he went down to the little wood rejoicing. By  the side of the stream he stood and seemed very sad. Once or twice he  looked up and down it mournfully, then he bent and looked at the  king-cups, first one and then another, very closely, and shaking his head.    For a long while he stood in silence, and all my old uneasiness returned,  and my bodings for the future.    And then I said, \"What manner of field is it?\"    And he shook his head sorrowfully.    \"It is a battlefield,\" he said.          THE DAY OF THE POLL      In the town by the sea it was the day of the poll, and the poet regarded  it sadly when he woke and saw the light of it coming in at his window  between two small curtains of gauze. And the day of the poll was  beautifully bright; stray bird-songs came to the poet at the window; the  air was crisp and wintry, but it was the blaze of sunlight that had  deceived the birds. He heard the sound of the sea that the moon led up the  shore, dragging the months away over the pebbles and shingles and piling  them up with the years where the worn-out centuries lay; he saw the  majestic downs stand facing mightily south-wards; saw the smoke of the  town float up to their heavenly faces--column after column rose calmly  into the morning as house by house was waked by peering shafts of the  sunlight and lit its fires for the day; column by column went up toward  the serene downs' faces, and failed before they came there and hung all  white over houses; and every one in the town was raving mad.    It was a strange thing that the poet did, for he hired the largest motor  in the town and covered it with all the flags he could find, and set out  to save an intelligence. And he presently found a man whose face was hot,  who shouted that the time was not far distant when a candidate, whom he  named, would be returned at the head of the poll by a thumping majority.  And by him the poet stopped and offered him a seat in the motor that was  covered with flags. When the man saw the flags that were on the motor, and  that it was the largest in the town, he got in. He said that his vote  should be given for that fiscal system that had made us what we are, in  order that the poor man's food should not be taxed to make the rich man  richer. Or else it was that he would give his vote for that system of  tariff reform which should unite us closer to our colonies with ties that  should long endure, and give employment to all. But it was not to the  polling-booth that the motor went, it passed it and left the town and came  by a small white winding road to the very top of the downs. There the poet  dismissed the car and let that wondering voter on to the grass and seated  himself on a rug. And for long the voter talked of those imperial  traditions that our forefathers had made for us and which he should uphold  with his vote, or else it was of a people oppressed by a feudal system  that was out of date and effete, and that should be ended or mended. But  the poet pointed out to him small, distant, wandering ships on the sunlit  strip of sea, and the birds far down below them, and the houses below the  birds, with the little columns of smoke that could not find the downs.    And at first the voter cried for his polling-booth like a child; but after  a while he grew calmer, save when faint bursts of cheering came twittering  up to the downs, when the voter would cry out bitterly against the  misgovernment of the Radical party, or else it was--I forget what the poet  told me--he extolled its splendid record.    \"See,\" said the poet, \"these ancient beautiful things, the downs and the  old-time houses and the morning, and the grey sea in the sunlight going  mumbling round the world. And this is the place they have chosen to go man  in!\"    And standing there with all broad England behind him, rolling northward,  down after down, and before him the glittering sea too far for the sound  of the roar of it, there seemed to the voter to grow less important the  questions that troubled the town. Yet he was still angry.    \"Why did you bring me here?\" he said again.    \"Because I grew lonely,\" said the poet, \"when all the town went mad.\"    Then he pointed out to the voter some old bent thorns, and showed him the  way that a wind had blown for a million years, coming up at dawn from the  sea; and he told him of the storms that visit the ships, and their names  and whence they come, and the currents they drive afield, and the way that  the swallows go. And he spoke of the down where they sat, when the summer  came, and the flowers that were not yet, and the different butterflies,  and about the bats and the swifts, and the thoughts in the heart of man.  He spoke of the aged windmill that stood on the down, and of how to  children it seemed a strange old man who was only dead by day. And as he  spoke, and as the sea-wind blew on that high and lonely place, there began  to slip away from the voter's mind meaningless phrases that had crowded it  long--thumping majority--victory in the"]]]
