[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11015"],[0,"Pantheism, Its Story and Significance (#2)"],[1,"before passing on to the promised historical review, it is, perhaps,  necessary to refer again to a remark previously made, that Pantheism may  be considered either from the point of view of philosophy, or from that  of religion. Not that the two points of view are mutually exclusive.  But, as a matter of fact, Pantheism as a religion is, with certain  exceptions among Indian saints and later Neoplatonists, almost entirely  a modern development, of which Spinoza was the first distinct and devout  teacher. For this statement justification will be given hereafter.  Meantime, to deprecate adverse prejudice, I may suggest that a careful  study of the most ancient forms of Pantheism seems to show that they  were purely philosophical; an endeavour to reach in thought the ultimate  reality which polytheism travestied, and which the senses disguised. But  little or no attempt was made to substitute the contemplation of the  Eternal for the worship of mediator divinities. Thus, in the same spirit  in which Socrates ordered the sacrifice of a cock to Aesculapius for his  recovery from the disease of mortal life, philosophical Pantheists,  whether Egyptian or Greek, or even Indian,[1] satisfied their religious  instincts by hearty communion with the popular worship of traditional  gods. Or, if it is thought that the mediaeval mystics were religious  Pantheists, a closer examination of their devout utterances will show  that, though they approximated to Pantheism, and even used language such  as, if interpreted logically, must have implied it, yet they carefully  reserved articles of the ecclesiastical creed, entirely inconsistent  with the fundamental position that there is nothing but God. Indeed,  their favourite comparison of creature life to the ray of a candle is  not really a Pantheistic conception; because to the true Pantheist the  creature is not an emanation external to God, but a finite mode of  infinite Being. Still the mystics did much to prepare the devout for an  acceptance of Spinoza's teaching. And although so amazing a  transfiguration of religion rather dazzled than convinced the world at  first; nay, though it must be acknowledged that one, and perhaps more of  Spinoza's fundamental conceptions have increasingly repelled rather than  attracted religious people, yet it can hardly be disputed that he gave  an impulse to contemplative religion, of which the effect is only now  beginning to be fully realised.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: If Buddha occurs to the reader, it should be remembered  that he was not a Pantheist at all. His ultimate aim was the dissolution  of personality in the Nothing. But that is not Pantheism.]          CHAPTER I      PRE-CHRISTIAN PANTHEISM    [Sidenote: Its Origins Doubtful and Unimportant.]    [Sidenote: The Secret of Pantheism is Within us.]    It has been the customary and perhaps inevitable method of writers on  Pantheism to trace its main idea back to the dreams of Vedic poets, the  musings of Egyptian priests, and the speculations of the Greeks. But  though it is undeniable that the divine unity of all Being was an almost  necessary issue of earliest human thought upon the many and the one, yet  the above method of treating Pantheism is to some extent misleading; and  therefore caution is needed in using it. For the revival of Pantheism at  the present day is much more a tangible resultant of action and reaction  between Science and Religion than a ghost conjured up by speculation.  Thus, religious belief, driven out from \"the darkness and the cloud\" of  Sinai, takes refuge in the mystery of matter; and if the glory passes  from the Mount of Transfiguration, it is because it expands to  etherialise the whole world as the garment of God. Again, the  evanescence of the atom into galaxies of \"electrons\" destroys the only  physical theory that ever threatened us with Atheism; and the  infinitesimal electrons themselves open up an immeasurable perspective  into the abyss of an Unknowable in which all things \"live and move and  have their being.\" Therefore it matters little to us, except as a matter  of antiquarian interest, to know what the Vedic singers may have  dreamed; or what Thales or Xenophanes or Parmenides may have thought  about the first principle of things, or about the many and the one. For  our spiritual genealogy is not from them, but from a nearer and double  line of begetters, including seers--in the true sense of the word--and  saints, for both are represented by Kepler and Hooker, Newton and Jeremy  Taylor, Descartes and Spinoza, Leibnitz and Wesley, Spencer and Newman.  And even these have authority not through any divine right of genius or  acquired claim of learning, but because they illumine and interpret  obscure suggestions of our own thoughts. Indeed, to the sacrament of  historic communion with the past, as well as to the chief rite of the  Church, the apostolic injunction is applicable: \"Let a man examine  himself; and so let him eat of that bread.\"    [Sidenote: Suggestions of Nature.]    Obeying that injunction, any man possessing ordinary powers of  observation and reflection may, in the course of a summer day's walk,  find abundant reason for interest in the speculations of historic  Pantheism. For the aspect of nature then presented to him is one both of  movement and repose, of variety and harmony, of multiplicity and unity.  Thus the slight breeze, scarcely stirring the drowsy flowery the  monotonous cadences of the stony brook, and the gliding of feathery  flecks of cloud across the blue, create a peace far deeper than absolute  stillness, and suggest an infinite life in which activity and repose are  one. Besides, there is evident everywhere an interplay of forces acting  and reacting so as mutually to help and fulfil one another. For  instance, the falling leaves give back the carbon they gathered from the  air, and so repay the soil with interest for the subtler essences  derived therefrom and dissolved in the sap. The bees, again, humming  among the flowers, while actuated only by instincts of appetite and  thrift, fructify the blooms, and become a connecting link between one  vegetable generation and another. The heat of the sun draws up water  from ocean and river and lake, while chilly currents of higher air  return it here and there in rain. So earth, sea, and air are for ever  trafficking together; and their interchange of riches and force is  complicated ten thousandfold by the activities of innumerable living  things, all adapting themselves by some internal energy to the ever  varying balance of heat and cold, moisture and drought, light and  darkness, chemical action and reaction. And all this has been going on  for untold millions of years; nor is there any sign of weariness now.    [Sidenote: Sympathy thus awakened with the old Pantheistic Aspiration to  find the One in the Many.]    In the mood engendered by such familiar experiences of a holiday  saunter, it may well occur to anyone to think with interest and sympathy  of the poets and seers who, thousands of years ago, first dared to  discern in this maze of existence the varied expression of one  all-embracing and eternal Life, or Power. Such contemplations and  speculations were entirely uninfluenced by anything which the Christian  Church, recognises as revelation.[2] Yet we must not on that account  suppose that they were without religion, or pretended to explain  anything without reference to superhuman beings called gods and demons.  On the contrary, they, for the most part, shared, subject to such  modifications as were imperatively required by cultivated common sense,  the beliefs of their native land. But the difference between these men  and their unthinking contemporaries lay in this; that the former  conceived of one supreme and comprehensive divinity beyond the reach of  common thought, an ultimate and eternal Being which included gods as  well as nature within its unity. So, for them, Indra, Zeus, or Jove were  mere modes of the one Being also manifest in man and bird and tree.    [Sidenote: The Vedas and Related Literature.]    Every race possessing even the rudiments of culture has been impelled by  a happy instinct, which, if we like, we may call inspiration, to record  in more or less permanent form its experience of nature, of life, and  of what seemed the mysteries of both. To this inspiration we owe the  sacred books of the Jews. But it is now generally recognised that an  impulse not wholly dissimilar also moved prophetic or poetic minds among  other races, such, for instance, as the Egyptians, the Chaldaeans, and  the Aryan conquerors of India, to inscribe on papyrus or stone, or brick  or palm-leaf, the results of experience as interpreted by free  imagination, traditional habits of thought, and limited knowledge. Of  this ancient literature a considerable part is taken up by the mysteries  apparently involved in life, conduct, and death. Most notably is this  the case with the ancient Indian literature called the Vedas, and such  sequels as the Upanishads, Sutras, and--much later--the Bhagavad Gita.  This collection, like our Bible, forms a library of writings issued at  various dates extending over much more than a thousand years.    [Sidenote: Indian Pantheism.]    The forgotten singers and preachers of this prehistoric wisdom were as  much haunted as we ourselves are with the harassing questions suggested  by sin and sorrow, by life and death, and by aspirations after a higher  state. And many, perhaps we may say most of them, found comfort in the  thought that essentially they belonged to an all comprehensive and  infinite Life, in which, if they acted purely and nobly, their seeming  personality might be merged and find peace. Their frame of mind was  religious rather than philosophical. But their philosophy was naturally  conformed to it; and in their contrast of the bewildering variety of  finite visible things with the unity of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11028"],[0,"Philippine Folk-Tales (#2)"],[1,"down,  and after satisfying his hunger he fell asleep.    He had not slept long when he was awakened by a loud noise. The owner  of the place was coming. He was fearful to look upon. His body was like  that of a person, but he was of enormous size; and he had a long tail,  and two horns growing out of his head. The farmer was frightened and  did not know what to do. He stood motionless till the master came up  and began to talk to him. Then he explained that he had come there  in search of food to keep his family alive. The monster was delighted  to hear this, for he saw that he had the man and the man's family in  his power. He told the traveller that in return for a certain promise  he would help him out of his troubles.    The demon, as he was called by some travellers to that land, showed  the farmer a smooth, round stone, which, he said, gave its possessor  the power of a magician. He offered to lend this to the farmer for  five years, if at the expiration of that time the farmer and family  would become his slaves. The farmer consented.    Then the demon was glad. He said to the farmer, \"You must squeeze  the stone when you wish to become invisible; and must put it in your  mouth when you wish to return to human form.\"    The man tried the power of the magic stone. He squeezed it, and  instantly became invisible to the demon; but he bade him farewell,  and promised to meet him in the same place at the appointed time.    In this invisible form the man crossed the water that washed the shore  of the island on which he lived. There he found a people who lived in  communities. He wanted something to eat, so he went into the shops;  but he found that a restaurant owned by a Chinaman was the one to  which most people of the city went. He put the stone in his mouth,  thus appearing in visible form, and, entering the restaurant, ordered  the best food he could find. He finished his meal quickly and went  out. The waiter, perceiving that he did not pay, followed him. The man  had no money; so he squeezed the stone and shot up into the air without  being seen. The Chinaman, alarmed by the cry of the waiter, came out  and ran in all directions, trying to find and catch the man. No one  could find him; and the people thought he must indeed be a fast runner  to escape so quickly, for they did not know of the gift of the demon.    Not far from that place he saw groups of men and women going in and out  of a large building. It was a bank. The farmer went in to see what he  could find. There he saw bags of money, gold and silver. He chuckled  with joy at this opportunity. In order to use his hands freely, he put  the stone in his mouth; but before he could fill all his pockets with  money, he was discovered by the two guards, who began to pound him on  the head. He struggled to save his life, and finally took the stone  out of his mouth and squeezed it. Instantly he vanished from their  sight; but he was vexed at the beating he had received, so he carried  off all the gold they had in the bank. The people inside as well as  outside the building became crazy. They ran about in all directions,  not knowing why. Some called the firemen, thinking the bank was on  fire; but nothing had happened, except that the farmer was gone and  the two guards were \"half dead frightened.\" They danced up and down  the streets in great excitement, but could not utter a word.    Straight home went the farmer, not stopping by the way. His wife and  children were awaiting him. He gave them the money, and told them  all about the fortune which he had gotten from the man on their own  island,--told all his secrets. Prosperous they became, and with the  money which he had brought they purchased all they needed from the  city just opposite them.    The time passed so pleasantly that the man was surprised to discover  that his promise would be due in two more days. He made preparations  to go back to the land of his master. Arrived there, he met the same  monster under the same tree. The demon was displeased to see the  old man alone, without the family which also had been promised. He  told the man that he would shut him in a cave and then would go and  capture those left at home.    But the farmer would not go to the cave. The demon tried to pull him  into a deep hole. Both struggled; and at last the farmer squeezed  the magic stone and disappeared. He took a green branch of the tree  and beat the demon. The demon surrendered. He begged for mercy.    The farmer went home, and from that day thought no more of the  demon. He knew that while he held the stone the monster would never  come to trouble him. And the family lived on in peace and happiness,  as they had done before the water-god became angry with them.      CHAPTER 3    Benito, the Faithful Servant. [4]    On a time there lived in a village a poor man and his wife, who had  a son named Benito. The one ambition of the lad from his earliest  youth was that he might be a help to the family in their struggle  for a living.    But the years went by, and he saw no opportunity until one day, as  they sat at dinner, his father fell to talking about the young King  who lived at a distance from the village, in a beautiful palace kept  by a retinue of servants. The boy was glad to hear this, and asked  his parents to let him become one of the servants of this great  ruler. The mother protested, fearing that her son could not please  his Royal Majesty; but the boy was so eager to try his fortune that  at last he was permitted to do so.    The next day his mother prepared food for him to eat on the journey,  and be started for the palace. The journey was tiresome; and when he  reached the palace he had difficulty in obtaining an audience with  the King. But when he succeeded and made known his wish, the monarch  detected a charming personality hidden within the ragged clothes,  and, believing the lad would make a willing servant, he accepted him.    The servants of his Majesty had many duties. Theirs was not a life of  ease, but of hard work. The very next day the King called Benito, and  said, \"I want you to bring me a certain beautiful princess who lives in  a land across the sea; and if you fail to do it, you will be punished.\"    Benito did not know how he was to do it; but he asked no questions,  and unhesitatingly answered, \"I will, my lord.\"    That same day he provided himself with everything he needed for the  journey and set off. He travelled a long distance until he came to the  heart of a thick forest, where he saw a large bird which said to him,  \"Oh, my friend! please take away these strings that are wrapped all  about me. If you will, I will help you whenever you call upon me.\"    Benito released the bird and asked it its name. It replied,  \"Sparrow-hawk,\" and flew away. Benito continued his journey until he  came to the seashore. There he could see no way of getting across, and,  remembering what the King had said if he failed, he stood looking out  over the sea, feeling very sad. The huge King of the Fishes saw him,  and swam toward him. \"Why are you so sad?\" asked the Fish.    \"I wish to cross the sea to find the beautiful Princess,\" replied  the youth.    \"Get on my back and I will take you across,\" said the King of the  Fishes.    Benito rode on the back of the Fish and crossed the sea. As soon as he  reached the other side, a fairy in the form of a woman appeared to him,  and became a great aid to him in his adventure. She knew exactly what  he wanted; so she told him that the Princess was shut up in a castle  guarded by giants, and that he would have to fight the giants before  he could reach her. For this purpose she gave him a magic sword,  which would kill on the instant anything it touched.    Benito now felt sure he could take the Princess from her cruel  guardsmen. He went to the castle, and there he saw many giants round  about it. When the giants saw him coming, they went out to meet him,  thinking to take him captive. They were so sure that they could easily  do it, that they went forth unarmed. As they came near, he touched  the foremost ones with his sword, and one after another they fell  down dead. The other giants, seeing so many of their number slain,  became terrified, and fled, leaving the castle unguarded.    The young man went to the Princess and told her that his master had  sent him to bring her to his palace. The young Princess was only  too glad to leave the land of the giants, where she had been held  captive. So the two set out together for the King's palace.    When they came to the sea they rode across it on the back of the  same fish that had carried Benito. They went through the forest,  and at last came to the palace. Here they were received with the  greatest rejoicings.    After a short time the King asked the Princess to become his wife. \"I  will, O King!\" she replied, \"if you will get the ring I lost in the  sea as I was crossing it.\"    The monarch called Benito, and ordered him to find the ring which  had been lost on their journey from the land of the giants.    Obedient to his master, Benito started, and travelled on and on till  he came to the shore of the sea. There he stood, gazing sadly out  over the waters, not knowing how he was to search for what lay at  the bottom of the deep ocean.    Again the King of the Fishes came to him, asking the cause of his  sadness. Benito replied, \"The Princess lost her ring while we were  crossing the sea, and I have been sent to find it.\"    The King-Fish summoned all the fishes to come to him. When they had  assembled, he noticed that one was missing. He commanded the others  to search for this one, and bring it to him. They found it under  a stone, and it said, \"I am so full! I have eaten so much that I  cannot swim.\" So the larger ones took it by the tail and dragged it  to their King.    \"Why did you not come when summoned?\" asked the King-Fish. \"I was so  full I could not swim,\" replied the"]]]
