This marvelous scheme of the Mormon prophet, with many  others equally bold and strangely uncommon for modern times, shall be  fully treated in the book of his own life, but it is proper to throw  into prominence the wondrous apostolic picture of Heber C. Kimball  \"opening the door of salvation to the nations that sat in darkness;\"  and for the gathering of an Israel from every people and from every  tongue. Relative to this, by far the greatest event in' his life, Heber  says, in his family journals:    \"The idea of being appointed to such an important mission was almost  more than I could bear up under. I felt my weakness and was nearly  ready to sink under it, but the moment I understood the will of my  heavenly Father, I felt a determination to go at all hazards, believing  that he would support me by his almighty power, and although my family  were dear to me, and I should have to leave them almost destitute, I  felt that the cause of truth, the gospel of Christ, outweighed every  other consideration. At this time many faltered in their faith, some of  the twelve were in rebellion against the prophet of God. John Boynton  said to me, if you are such a d--d fool as to go at the call of the  fallen prophet, I will not help you a dime, and if you are cast on Van  Dieman's Land I will not make an effort to help you. Lyman E. Johnson  said he did not want me to go on my mission, but if I was determined  to go, he would help me all he could; he took his cloak from off his  back and put it on mine. Brother Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Sr.,  Brigham Young, Newel K. Whitney and others said go and do as the  prophet has told you and you shall prosper and be blessed with power to  do a glorious work. Hyrum, seeing the condition of the church, when he  talked about my mission wept like a little child; he was continually  blessing and encouraging me, and pouring out his soul in prophesies  upon my head; he said go and you shall prosper as not many have  prospered.\"    \"A short time previous to my husband's starting,\" continues Sister  Vilate, \"he was prostrated on his bed from a stitch in his back, which  suddenly seized him while chopping and drawing wood for his family, so  that he could not stir a limb without exclaiming, from the severeness  of the pain. Joseph Smith hearing of it came to see him, bringing  Oliver Cowdery and Bishop Partridge with him. They prayed for and  blessed him, Joseph being mouth, beseeching God to raise him up, &c. He  then took him by the right hand and said, 'Brother Heber, I take you by  your right hand, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and by virtue  of the holy priesthood vested in me, I command you, in the name of  Jesus Christ, to rise, and be thou made whole.' He arose from his bed,  put on his clothes, and started with them, and went up to the temple,  and felt no more of the pain afterwards.    \"At length the day for the departure of my husband arrived. It was June  13th, 1837. He was in the midst of his family, blessing them, when  Brother R. B. Thompson, who was to accompany him two or three hundred  miles, came in to ascertain when Heber would start. Brother Thompson,  in after years, writing an account in Heber's journal of his first  mission to Great Britain, in its preface thus describes that solemn  family scene: 'The door being partly open I entered and felt struck  with the sight which presented itself to my view. I would have retired,  thinking I was intruding, but I felt riveted to the spot. The father  was pouring out his soul to      That God who rules on high,    Who all the earth surveys;    That rides upon the stormy sky,    And calms the roaring seas,    \"that he would grant unto him a prosperous voyage across the mighty  ocean, and make him useful wherever his lot should be cast, and that  he who careth for the sparrows, and feedeth the young ravens when they  cry, would supply the wants of his wife and little ones in his absence.  He then, like the patriarchs, and by virtue of his office, laid his  hands upon their heads individually, leaving a father's blessing upon  them, and commending them to the care and protection of God, while  he should be engaged preaching the gospel in foreign lands. While  thus engaged his voice was almost lost in the sobs of those around,  who tried in vain to suppress them. The idea of being separated from  their protector and father for so long a time, was indeed painful. He  proceeded, but his heart was too much affected to do so regularly; his  emotions were great, and he was obliged to stop at intervals, while  the big tears rolled down his cheeks, an index to the feelings which  reigned in his bosom. My heart was not stout enough to refrain; in  spite of myself I wept and mingled my tears with theirs at the same  time. I felt thankful that I had the privilege of contemplating such a  scene. I realized that nothing could induce that man to tear himself  from so affectionate a family group--from his partner and children who  were so dear to him--but a sense of duty and love to God and attachment  to his cause.'    \"At nine o'clock in the morning of this never-to-be-forgotten-day,\"  continues Sister Vilate, \"Heber bade adieu to his brethren and friends  and started without purse or scrip to preach the gospel in a foreign  land. He was accompanied by myself and children, and some of the  brethren and sisters, to Fairport. Sister Mary Fielding, who became  afterwards the wife of Hyrum Smith, gave him five dollars, with which  Heber paid the passage of himself and Brother Hyde to Buffalo. They  were also accompanied by her and Brother Thompson and his wife (Mary  Fielding's sister), who were going on a mission to Canada. Heber  himself was accompanied to Great Britain by Elders Orson Hyde, Willard  Richards, J. Goodson and J. Russell, and Priest Joseph Fielding.\"    Here, for the present, we must leave Brother Heber to prosecute his  important mission, and this illustrious woman to act her part alone as  an apostle's wife, while we introduce others of the sisters, and follow  the church through its scenes of persecution and removal from Missouri  to Illinois.        CHAPTER XV.    HAUN'S MILL--JOSEPH YOUNG'S STORY OF THE MASSACRE--SISTER AMANDA  SMITH'S STORY OF THAT TERRIBLE TRAGEDY--HER WOUNDED BOY'S MIRACULOUS  CURE--HER FINAL ESCAPE FROM MISSOURI.    Towards the close of October, 1838, several small detachments of  migrants from Ohio entered the State of Missouri. They were of the  refugees from Kirtland. Their destinations were the counties of  Caldwell and Davies, where the saints had located in that State.    Haun's Mill, in Caldwell county, was soon to become the scene of one of  the darkest tragedies on record.    The mill was owned by a Mormon brother whose name it bore, and in the  neighborhood some Mormon families had settled.    To Haun's Mill came the doomed refugees.    They had been met on their entrance into the State of Missouri by armed  mobs. Governor Boggs had just issued his order to exterminate the  entire Mormon community.    The coming of the refugees into the inhospitable State could not have  been more ill-timed, though when they left Kirtland they expected to  find a brotherhood in Far West.    \"Halt!\" commanded the leader of a band of well-mounted and well-armed  mobocrats, who charged down upon them as they journeyed on their way.    \"If you proceed any farther west,\" said the captain, \"you will be  instantly shot.\"    \"Wherefore?\" inquired the pilgrims.    \"You are d--d Mormons!\"    \"We are law-abiding Americans, and have given no cause of offence.\"    \"You are d--d Mormons. That's offence enough. Within ten days every  Mormon must be out of Missouri, or men, women and children will be shot  down indiscriminately. No mercy will be shown. It is the order of the  Governor that you should all be exterminated; and by G--d you will be.\"    In consternation the refugees retreated, and gathered at Haun's Mill.    It was Sunday, October 26. The Mormons were holding a council and  deliberating upon the best course to pursue to defend themselves  against the mob that was collecting in the neighborhood, under the  command of a Colonel Jennings, or Livingston, and threatening them with  house-burning and killing.    Joseph Young, the brother of Brigham, was in the council. He had  arrived at the mill that day, with his family, retreating from the mob.    The decision of the council was that the neighborhood of Haun's  Mill should put itself in an attitude of defence. Accordingly about  twenty-eight of the brethren armed themselves and prepared to resist an  attack.    But the same evening the mob sent one of their number to enter into a  treaty with the Mormons at the mill. The treaty was accepted on the  condition of mutual forbearance, and that each party should exert its  influence to prevent any further hostilities.    At this time, however, there was another mob collecting at William  Mann's, on Grand River, so that the brethren remained under arms over  Monday, the 29th, which passed without attack from any quarter.    \"On Tuesday, the 30th,\" says Joseph Young, \"that bloody tragedy was  enacted, the scenes of which I shall never forget.    \"More than three-fourths of the day had passed in tranquillity, as  smiling as the preceding one. I think there was no individual of our  company that was apprised of the sudden and awful fate which hung over  our heads like an overwhelming torrent, and which was to change the  prospects, the feelings and sympathies of about thirty families.    \"The banks of Shoal Creek, on either side, teemed with children  sporting and playing, while their mothers were engaged in domestic  employments. Fathers or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#19)"],[1," truth.\"    \"Come, come, Cornelia, I think he generally tells the truth, but he  changes his opinion so often it sometimes sounds as if he didn't.\"    \"It sounds like it mighty often, believe ME.  But trust one man to  excuse another.  I have no use for Robert Baxter.  He turned Methodist  just because the Presbyterian choir happened to be singing 'Behold the  bridegroom cometh' for a collection piece when him and Margaret walked  up the aisle the Sunday after they were married.  Served him right for  being late!  He always insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult  him, as if he was of that much importance.  But that family always  thought they were much bigger potatoes than they really were.  His  brother Eliphalet imagined the devil was always at his elbow--but _I_  never believed the devil wasted that much time on him.\"    \"I--don't--know,\" said Captain Jim thoughtfully.  \"Eliphalet Baxter  lived too much alone--hadn't even a cat or dog to keep him human.  When  a man is alone he's mighty apt to be with the devil--if he ain't with  God.  He has to choose which company he'll keep, I reckon.  If the  devil always was at Life Baxter's elbow it must have been because Life  liked to have him there.\"    \"Man-like,\" said Miss Cornelia, and subsided into silence over a  complicated arrangement of tucks until Captain Jim deliberately stirred  her up again by remarking in a casual way:    \"I was up to the Methodist church last Sunday morning.\"    \"You'd better have been home reading your Bible,\" was Miss Cornelia's  retort.    \"Come, now, Cornelia, _I_ can't see any harm in going to the Methodist  church when there's no preaching in your own.  I've been a Presbyterian  for seventy-six years, and it isn't likely my theology will hoist  anchor at this late day.\"    \"It's setting a bad example,\" said Miss Cornelia grimly.    \"Besides,\" continued wicked Captain Jim, \"I wanted to hear some good  singing.  The Methodists have a good choir; and you can't deny,  Cornelia, that the singing in our church is awful since the split in  the choir.\"    \"What if the singing isn't good?  They're doing their best, and God  sees no difference between the voice of a crow and the voice of a  nightingale.\"    \"Come, come, Cornelia,\" said Captain Jim mildly, \"I've a better opinion  of the Almighty's ear for music than THAT.\"    \"What caused the trouble in our choir?\" asked Gilbert, who was  suffering from suppressed laughter.    \"It dates back to the new church, three years ago,\" answered Captain  Jim.  \"We had a fearful time over the building of that church--fell out  over the question of a new site.  The two sites wasn't more'n two  hundred yards apart, but you'd have thought they was a thousand by the  bitterness of that fight.  We was split up into three factions--one  wanted the east site and one the south, and one held to the old.  It  was fought out in bed and at board, and in church and at market.  All  the old scandals of three generations were dragged out of their graves  and aired.  Three matches was broken up by it.  And the meetings we had  to try to settle the question!  Cornelia, will you ever forget the one  when old Luther Burns got up and made a speech?  HE stated his opinions  forcibly.\"    \"Call a spade a spade, Captain.  You mean he got red-mad and raked them  all, fore and aft.  They deserved it too--a pack of incapables.  But  what would you expect of a committee of men?  That building committee  held twenty-seven meetings, and at the end of the twenty-seventh  weren't no nearer having a church than when they begun--not so near,  for a fact, for in one fit of hurrying things along they'd gone to work  and tore the old church down, so there we were, without a church, and  no place but the hall to worship in.\"    \"The Methodists offered us their church, Cornelia.\"    \"The Glen St. Mary church wouldn't have been built to this day,\" went  on Miss Cornelia, ignoring Captain Jim, \"if we women hadn't just  started in and took charge.  We said WE meant to have a church, if the  men meant to quarrel till doomsday, and we were tired of being a  laughing-stock for the Methodists.  We held ONE meeting and elected a  committee and canvassed for subscriptions.  We got them, too.  When any  of the men tried to sass us we told them they'd tried for two years to  build a church and it was our turn now.  We shut them up close, believe  ME, and in six months we had our church.  Of course, when the men saw  we were determined they stopped fighting and went to work, man-like, as  soon as they saw they had to, or quit bossing.  Oh, women can't preach  or be elders; but they can build churches and scare up the money for  them.\"    \"The Methodists allow women to preach,\" said Captain Jim.    Miss Cornelia glared at him.    \"I never said the Methodists hadn't common sense, Captain. What I say  is, I doubt if they have much religion.\"    \"I suppose you are in favor of votes for women, Miss Cornelia,\" said  Gilbert.    \"I'm not hankering after the vote, believe ME,\" said Miss Cornelia  scornfully.  \"_I_ know what it is to clean up after the men.  But some  of these days, when the men realize they've got the world into a mess  they can't get it out of, they'll be glad to give us the vote, and  shoulder their troubles over on us.  That's THEIR scheme.  Oh, it's  well that women are patient, believe ME!\"    \"What about Job?\" suggested Captain Jim.    \"Job!  It was such a rare thing to find a patient man that when one was  really discovered they were determined he shouldn't be forgotten,\"  retorted Miss Cornelia triumphantly.  \"Anyhow, the virtue doesn't go  with the name.  There never was such an impatient man born as old Job  Taylor over harbor.\"    \"Well, you know, he had a good deal to try him, Cornelia.  Even you  can't defend his wife.  I always remember what old William MacAllister  said of her at her funeral, 'There's nae doot she was a Chreestian  wumman, but she had the de'il's own temper.'\"    \"I suppose she WAS trying,\" admitted Miss Cornelia reluctantly, \"but  that didn't justify what Job said when she died.  He rode home from the  graveyard the day of the funeral with my father.  He never said a word  till they got near home.  Then he heaved a big sigh and said, 'You may  not believe it, Stephen, but this is the happiest day of my life!'  Wasn't that like a man?\"    \"I s'pose poor old Mrs. Job did make life kinder uneasy for him,\"  reflected Captain Jim.    \"Well, there's such a thing as decency, isn't there?  Even if a man is  rejoicing in his heart over his wife being dead, he needn't proclaim it  to the four winds of heaven.  And happy day or not, Job Taylor wasn't  long in marrying again, you might notice.  His second wife could manage  him.  She made him walk Spanish, believe me!  The first thing she did  was to make him hustle round and put up a tombstone to the first Mrs.  Job--and she had a place left on it for her own name.  She said there'd  be nobody to make Job put up a monument to HER.\"    \"Speaking of Taylors, how is Mrs. Lewis Taylor up at the Glen, doctor?\"  asked Captain Jim.    \"She's getting better slowly--but she has to work too hard,\" replied  Gilbert.    \"Her husband works hard too--raising prize pigs,\" said Miss Cornelia.  \"He's noted for his beautiful pigs.  He's a heap prouder of his pigs  than of his children.  But then, to be sure, his pigs are the best pigs  possible, while his children don't amount to much.  He picked a poor  mother for them, and starved her while she was bearing and rearing  them.  His pigs got the cream and his children got the skim milk.    \"There are times, Cornelia, when I have to agree with you, though it  hurts me,\" said Captain Jim.  \"That's just exactly the truth about  Lewis Taylor.  When I see those poor, miserable children of his, robbed  of all children ought to have, it p'isens my own bite and sup for days  afterwards.\"    Gilbert went out to the kitchen in response to Anne's beckoning.  Anne  shut the door and gave him a connubial lecture.    \"Gilbert, you and Captain Jim must stop baiting Miss Cornelia.  Oh,  I've been listening to you--and I just won't allow it.\"    'Anne, Miss Cornelia is enjoying herself hugely.  You know she is.'    \"Well, never mind.  You two needn't egg her on like that.  Dinner is  ready now, and, Gilbert, DON'T let Mrs. Rachel carve the geese.  I know  she means to offer to do it because she doesn't think you can do it  properly.  Show her you can.\"    \"I ought to be able to.  I've been studying A-B-C-D diagrams of carving  for the past month,\" said Gilbert.  \"Only don't talk to me while I'm  doing it, Anne, for if you drive the letters out of my head I'll be in  a worse predicament than you were in old geometry days when the teacher  changed them.\"    Gilbert carved the geese beautifully.  Even Mrs. Rachel had to admit  that.  And everybody ate of them and enjoyed them.  Anne's first  Christmas dinner was a great success and she beamed with housewifely  pride.  Merry was the feast and long; and when it was over they  gathered around the cheer of the red hearth flame and Captain Jim told  them stories until the red sun swung low over Four Winds Harbor, and  the long blue shadows of the Lombardies fell across the snow in the  lane.    \"I must be getting back to the light,\" he said finally.  \"I'll jest  have time to walk home before sundown.  Thank you for a beautiful  Christmas, Mistress Blythe.  Bring Master Davy down to the light some  night before he goes home.    \"I want to see those stone gods,\" said Davy with a relish.        CHAPTER 16    NEW YEAR'S EVE AT THE LIGHT    The Green Gables folk went home after Christmas, Marilla under solemn  covenant to return for a month in the spring.  More snow came before  New Year's, and the harbor froze over, but the gulf still was free,  beyond the white, imprisoned fields.  The last day of the old year was  one of those bright, cold, dazzling winter days, which bombard us with  their brilliancy,"]]]
