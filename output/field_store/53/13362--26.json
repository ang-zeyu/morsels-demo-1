Here, as in many parts of Europe, the sciences are thought worthy to  occupy the mind only so far as they confer some immediate and  practical benefit on society.    We found more than five hundred Caribs in the village of Cari; and saw  many others in the surrounding missions. It is curious to observe this  nomad people, recently attached to the soil, and differing from all  the other Indians in their physical and intellectual powers. They are  a very tall race of men, their height being from five feet six inches,  to five feet ten inches. According to a practice common in America,  the women are more sparingly clothed than the men. The former wear  only the guajuco, or perizoma, in the form of a band. The men have the  lower part of the body wrapped in a piece of blue cloth, so dark as to  be almost black. This drapery is so ample that, on the lowering of the  temperature towards evening, the Caribs throw it over their shoulders.  Their bodies tinged with onoto,* (* Rocou, obtained from the Bixa  orellana. This paint is called in the Carib tongue, bichet.) their  tall figures, of a reddish copper-colour, and their picturesque  drapery, when seen from a distance, relieved against the sky as a  background, resemble antique statues of bronze. The men cut their hair  in a very peculiar manner, very much in the style of the monks. A part  of the forehead is shaved, which makes it appear extremely high, and a  circular tuft of hair is left near the crown of the head. This  resemblance between the Caribs and the monks is not the result of  mission life. It is not caused, as had been erroneously supposed, by  the desire of the natives to imitate their masters, the Franciscan  monks. The tribes that have preserved their wild independence, between  the sources of the Carony and the Rio Branco, are distinguished by the  same cerquillo de frailes,* (* Circular tonsure of the friars.) which  the early Spanish historians at the time of the discovery of America  attributed to the nations of the Carib race. All the men of this race  whom we saw either during our voyage on the Lower Orinoco, or in the  missions of Piritu, differ from the other Indians not only in the  tallness of their stature, but also in the regularity of their  features. Their noses are smaller, and less flattened; the cheek-bones  are not so high; and their physiognomy has less of the Mongol  character. Their eyes, which are darker than those of the other hordes  of Guiana, denote intelligence, and it may even be said, the habit of  reflection. The Caribs have a gravity of manner, and a certain look of  sadness which is observable among most of the primitive inhabitants of  the New World. The expression of severity in their features is  heightened by the practice of dyeing their eyebrows with the juice of  caruto: they also lengthen their eyebrows, thereby giving them the  appearance of being joined together; and they often mark their faces  all over with black spots to give themselves a more fierce appearance.  The Carib women are less robust and good-looking than the men, On them  devolves almost the whole burden of domestic work, as well as much of  the out-door labour. They asked us eagerly for pins, which they stuck  under their lower lip, making the head of the pin penetrate deeply  into the skin. The young girls are painted red, and are almost naked.  Among the different nations of the old and the new worlds, the idea of  nudity is altogether relative. A woman in some parts of Asia is not  permitted to show the tips of her fingers; while an Indian of the  Carib race is far from considering herself unclothed if she wear round  her waist a guajuco two inches broad. Even this band is regarded as  less essential than the pigment which covers the skin. To go out of  the hut without being painted, would be to transgress all the rules of  Carib decency.    The Indians of the missions of Piritu especially attracted our  attention, because they belong to a nation which, by its daring, its  warlike enterprises, and its mercantile spirit has exercised great  influence over the vast country extending from the equator towards the  northern coast. Everywhere on the Orinoco we beheld traces of the  hostile incursions of the Caribs: incursions which heretofore extended  from the sources of the Carony and the Erevato as far as the banks of  the Ventuari, the Atacavi, and the Rio Negro. The Carib language is  consequently the most general in this part of the world; it has even  passed (like the language of the Lenni-Lenapes, or Algonkins, and the  Natchez or Muskoghees, on the west of the Allegheny mountains) to  tribes which have not a common origin.    When we survey that multitude of nations spread over North and South  America, eastward of the Cordilleras of the Andes, we fix our  attention particularly on those who, having long held dominion over  their neighbours, have acted an important part on the stage of the  world. It is the business of the historian to group facts, to  distinguish masses, to ascend to the common sources of many migrations  and popular movements. Great empires, the regular organization of a  sacerdotal hierarchy, and the culture which that organization favours  in the first ages of society, have existed only on the high mountains  of the western world. In Mexico we see a vast monarchy enclosing small  republics; at Cundinamarca and Peru we find pure theocracies.  Fortified towns, highways and large edifices of stone, an  extraordinary development of the feudal system, the separation of  castes, convents of men and women, religious congregations regulated  by discipline more or less severe, complicated divisions of time  connected with the calendars, the zodiacs, and the astrology of the  enlightened nations of Asia--all these phenomena in America belong to  one region only, the long and narrow Alpine band extending from the  thirtieth degree of north latitude to the twenty-fifth degree of  south. The migration of nations in the ancient world was from east to  west; the Basques or Iberians, the Celts, the Germans and the Pelasgi,  appeared in succession. In the New World similar migrations flowed  from north to south. Among the nations that inhabit the two  hemispheres, the direction of this movement followed that of the  mountains; but in the torrid zone the temperate table-lands of the  Cordilleras had greater influence on the destiny of mankind, than the  mountains of Asia and central Europe. As, properly speaking, only  civilized nations have a history, the history of the Americans is  necessarily no more than that of a small portion of the inhabitants of  the mountains. Profound obscurity envelops the vast country which  stretches from the eastern slope of the Cordilleras towards the  Atlantic; and for this very reason, whatever in that country relates  to the preponderance of one nation over others, to distant migrations,  to the physiognomical features which denote a foreign race, excite our  deepest interest.    Amidst the plains of North America, some powerful nation, which has  disappeared, constructed circular, square, and octagonal  fortifications; walls six thousand toises in length; tumuli from seven  to eight hundred feet in diameter, and one hundred and forty feet in  height, sometimes round, sometimes with several stories and containing  thousands of skeletons. These skeletons are the remains of men less  slender and more squat than the present inhabitants of those  countries. Other bones wrapped in fabrics resembling those of the  Sandwich and Feejee Islands are found in the natural grottoes of  Kentucky. What is become of those nations of Louisiana anterior to the  Lenni-Lenapes, the Shawanese, and perhaps even to the Sioux  (Nadowesses, Nahcotas) of the Missouri, who are strongly mongolised;  and who, it is believed, according to their own traditions, came from  the coast of Asia? In the plains of South America we find only a very  few hillocks of that kind called cerros hechos a mano;* (* Hills made  by the hand, or artificial hills.) and nowhere any works of  fortification analogous to those of the Ohio. However, on a vast space  of ground, at the Lower Orinoco, as well as on the banks of the  Cassiquiare and between the sources of the Essequibo and the Rio  Branco, there are rocks of granite covered with symbolic figures.  These sculptures denote that the extinct generations belonged to  nations different from those which now inhabit the same regions. There  seems to be no connection between the history of Mexico and that of  Cundinamarca and of Peru; but in the plains of the east a warlike and  long-dominant nation betrays in its features and its physical  constitution traces of a foreign origin. The Caribs preserve  traditions that seem to indicate ancient communications between North  and South America. Such a phenomenon deserves particular attention. If  it be true that savages are for the most part degenerate races,  remnants escaped from a common wreck, as their languages, their  cosmogonic fables, and numerous other indications seem to prove, it  becomes doubly important to examine the course by which these remnants  have been driven from one hemisphere to the other.    That fine race of people, the Caribs, now occupy only a small part of  the country which they inhabited at the time of the discovery of  America. The cruelties exercised by Europeans have entirely  exterminated them from the West Indian Islands and the coasts of  Darien; while under the government of the missions they have formed  populous villages in the provinces of New Barcelona and Spanish  Guiana. The Caribs who inhabit the Llanos of Piritu and the banks of  the Carony and the Cuyuni may be estimated at more than thirty-five  thousand. If we add to this number the independent Caribs who live  westward of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#19)"],[1," bliss,' &c., makes statements  as to the relative bliss enjoyed by the different classes of embodied  souls; the concluding passage 'He who knows the bliss of that Brahman  from whence all speech, together with the mind, turns away unable to  reach it,' hence must be taken as proclaiming with emphasis the infinite  nature of Brahman's auspicious qualities. Moreover, a clause in the  chapter under discussion--viz. 'he obtains all desires, together with  Brahman the all-wise' (II, 1)--which gives information as to the fruit  of the knowledge of Brahman clearly declares the infinite nature of the  qualities of the highest all-wise Brahman. The desires are the  auspicious qualities of Brahman which are the objects of desire; the man  who knows Brahman obtains, together with Brahman, all qualities of it.  The expression 'together with' is meant to bring out the primary  importance of the qualities; as also described in the so-called dahara-  vidyâ (Ch. Up. VIII, 1). And that fruit and meditation are of the same  character (i.e. that in meditations on Brahman its qualities are the  chief matter of meditation, just as these qualities are the principal  point in Brahman reached by the Devotee) is proved by the text  'According to what a man's thought is in this world, so will he be after  he has departed this life' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 1). If it be said that the  passage 'By whom it is not thought by him it is thought', 'not  understood by those who understand' (Ke. Up. II, 3), declares Brahman  not to be an object of knowledge; we deny this, because were it so,  certain other texts would not teach that final Release results from  knowledge; cp. 'He who knows Brahman obtains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II,  1, 1); 'He knows Brahman, he becomes Brahman.' And, moreover, the text  'He who knows Brahman as non-existing becomes himself non-existing; he  who knows Brahman as existing, him we know himself as existing' (Taitt  Up. II, 6, 1), makes the existence and non-existence of the Self  dependent on the existence and non-existence of knowledge which has  Brahman for its object. We thus conclude that all scriptural texts  enjoin just the knowledge of Brahman for the sake of final Release. This  knowledge is, as we already know, of the nature of meditation, and what  is to be meditated on is Brahman as possessing qualities. (The text from  the Ke. Up. then explains itself as follows:--) We are informed by the  passage 'from whence speech together with mind turns away, being unable  to reach it', that the infinite Brahman with its unlimited excellences  cannot be defined either by mind or speech as being so or so much, and  from this we conclude the Kena text to mean that Brahman is not thought  and not understood by those who understand it to be of a definitely  limited nature; Brahman in truth being unlimited. If the text did not  mean this, it would be self-contradictory, parts of it saying that  Brahman is _not_ thought and _not_ understood, and other parts, that it  _is_ thought and _is_ understood.    Now as regards the assertion that the text 'Thou mayest not see the seer  of seeing; thou mayest not think the thinker of thinking' (Bri. Up. III,  5, 2), denies the existence of a seeing and thinking subject different  from mere seeing and thinking--This view is refuted by the following  interpretation. The text addresses itself to a person who has formed the  erroneous opinion that the quality of consciousness or knowledge does  not constitute the essential nature of the knower, but belongs to it  only as an adventitious attribute, and tells him 'Do not view or think  the Self to be such, but consider the seeing and thinking Self to have  seeing and thinking for its essential nature.'--Or else this text may  mean that the embodied Self which is the seer of seeing and the thinker  of thinking should be set aside, and that only the highest Self--the  inner Self of all beings--should be meditated upon.--Otherwise a  conflict would arise with texts declaring the knowership of the Self,  such as 'whereby should he know the knower?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15).    Your assertion that the text 'Bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1)  proves pure Bliss to constitute the essential nature of Brahman is  already disposed of by the refutation of the view that knowledge  (consciousness) constitutes the essential nature of Brahman; Brahman  being in reality the substrate only of knowledge. For by bliss we  understand a pleasing state of consciousness. Such passages as  'consciousness, bliss is Brahman,' therefore mean 'consciousness--the  essential character of which is bliss--is Brahman.' On this identity of  the two things there rests that homogeneous character of Brahman, so  much insisted upon by yourself. And in the same way as numerous passages  teach that Brahman, while having knowledge for its essential nature, is  at the same time a knowing subject; so other passages, speaking of  Brahman as something separate from mere bliss, show it to be not mere  bliss but a subject enjoying bliss; cp. 'That is one bliss of Brahman'  (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 4); 'he knowing the bliss of Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II,  9, 1). To be a subject enjoying bliss is in fact the same as to be a  conscious subject.    We now turn to the numerous texts which, according to the view of our  opponent, negative the existence of plurality.--'Where there is duality  as it were' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'There is not any plurality here; from  death to death goes he who sees here any plurality' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 19);  'But when for him the Self alone has become all, by what means, and whom,  should he see?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15) &c.--But what all these texts deny  is only plurality in so far as contradicting that unity of the world  which depends on its being in its entirety an effect of Brahman, and  having Brahman for its inward ruling principle and its true Self. They  do not, on the other hand, deny that plurality on Brahman's part which  depends on its intention to become manifold--a plurality proved by the  text 'May I be many, may I grow forth' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3). Nor can our  opponent urge against this that, owing to the denial of plurality  contained in other passages this last text refers to something not real;  for it is an altogether laughable assertion that Scripture should at  first teach the doctrine, difficult to comprehend, that plurality as  suggested by Perception and the other means of Knowledge belongs to  Brahman also, and should afterwards negative this very doctrine!    Nor is it true that the text 'If he makes but the smallest \"antaram\" (i.  e. difference, interval, break) in it there is fear for him' (Taitt. Up.  II, 7) implies that he who sees plurality within Brahman encounters fear.  For the other text 'All this is Brahman; let a man meditate with calm  mind on all this as beginning, ending and breathing in it, i.e. Brahman'  (Ch. Up. III, 14, 1) teaches directly that reflection on the plurality  of Brahman is the cause of peace of mind. For this passage declares that  peace of mind is produced by a reflection on the entire world as  springing from, abiding within, and being absorbed into Brahman, and  thus having Brahman for its Self; and as thus the view of Brahman  constituting the Self of the world with all its manifold distinctions of  gods, men, animals, inanimate matter and so on, is said to be the cause  of peace of mind, and, consequently, of absence of fear, that same view  surely cannot be a _cause_ of fear!--But how then is it that the Taitt.  text declares that 'there is fear for him'?--That text, we reply,  declares in its earlier part that rest in Brahman is the cause of  fearlessness ('when he finds freedom from fear, rest, in that which is  invisible, incorporeal, undefined, unsupported; then he has obtained  fearlessness'); its latter part therefore means that fear takes place  when there is an interval, a break, in this resting in Brahman. As the  great Rishi says 'When Vâsudeva is not meditated on for an hour or even  a moment only; that is loss, that is great calamity, that is error, that  is change.'    The Sûtra III, 2, ii does not, as our opponent alleges, refer to a  Brahman free from all difference, but to Brahman as possessing  attributes--as we shall show in its place. And the Sûtra IV, 2, 3  declares that the things seen in dreams are mere 'Mâyâ' because they  differ in character from the things perceived in the waking state; from  which it follows that the latter things are real.    [FOOTNOTE 82:1. Which passage appears to refer to a nirguna brahman,  whence it might be inferred that the connected initial passage--'Satyam  jñanam,' &c.--has a similar purport.]          Nor do Smriti and Purâna teach such a doctrine.    Nor is it true that also according to Smriti and Purânas only non-  differenced consciousness is real and everything else unreal.--'He who  knows me as unborn and without a beginning, the supreme Lord of the  worlds' (Bha. Gî. X, 3); 'All beings abide in me, I abide not in them.  Nay, the beings abide not in me--behold my lordly power. My Self  bringing forth the beings supports them but does not abide in them' (Bha.  Gî. IX, 4, 5); 'I am the origin and the dissolution of the entire world;  higher than I there is nothing else: on me all this is strung as pearls  on a thread' (Bha. Gî. VII, 6, 7); 'Pervading this entire Universe by a  portion (of mine) I abide' (Bha. Gî. X, 42); 'But another, the highest  Person, is called the highest Self who, pervading the three worlds  supports them, the eternal Lord. Because I transcend the Perishable and  am higher than the Imperishable even, I am among the people and in the  Veda celebrated as the supreme Person' (Bha. Gî. XV, 17, 18).    'He transcends the fundamental matter of all beings, its modifications,  properties and imperfections; he transcends all investing (obscuring)  influences, he who is the Self of all.
