TESTIMONY OF ORSON HYDE.        \"The shafts of the enemy are always aimed at the head first.      Brother Joseph said some time before he was murdered, 'If I am      taken away, upon you, the Twelve, will rest the responsibility of      leading this people, and do not be bluffed off by any man.\"--Times      and Seasons, 5: 650.        \"Before I went east on the 4th of April last, we were in council      with Brother Joseph almost every day for weeks, said Brother Joseph      in one of those councils, 'There is something going to happen; I      don't know what it is, but the Lord bids me to hasten and give you      your endowment before the Temple is finished.' He conducted us      through every ordinance of the Holy Priesthood, and when he had      gone through with all the ordinances, he rejoiced very much, and      said, 'Now, if they kill me, you have got all the keys, and all      the ordinances and you can confer them upon others, and the hosts      of Satan will not be able to tear down the kingdom, as fast as you      will be able to build it up;' and now, said he, 'on your shoulders      will the responsibility of leading this people rest, for the Lord      is going to let me rest awhile.'\"--Times and Seasons, 5: 651.      TESTIMONY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.        \"Has the Prophet Joseph found Elder Rigdon in his councils when he      organized the quorum of the Twelve, a few months before his death,      to prepare them for the endowment? And when they received their      endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom of God,      and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly      things, and thus, addressing the Twelve, (Joseph) exclaimed,      'Upon your shoulders, the kingdom rests, and you must round your      shoulders, and bear it; for I have had to do it until now. But now      the responsibility rests upon you.'\"--Times and Seasons, 5: 698    And also President Woodruff's testimony given in 1892. (Succession,  page 101).      BATHSHEBA W. SMITH'S TESTIMONY.        \"I was a resident of Nauvoo, State of Illinois, from 1840 to 1846.      I was married to George A. Smith, July 25, 1841, Elder Don Carlos      Smith performing the ceremony. Near the close of the year 1843,      or in the beginning of the year 1844, I received the ordinance of      anointing in a room in Sister Emma Smith's house in Nauvoo, and      the same day, in company with my husband, I received my endowment      in the upper room over the Prophet Joseph Smith's store. The      endowments were given under the direction of the Prophet Joseph      Smith, who afterwards gave us lectures or instructions in regard to      the endowment ceremonies. They are the same today as they were then.        In the year 1844, a short time before the death of the Prophet      Joseph Smith, it was my privilege to attend a regular prayer circle      meeting in the upper room over the Prophet's store. There were      present at this meeting most of the Twelve Apostles, their wives,      and a number of other prominent brethren and their wives. On that      occasion the Prophet arose and spoke at great length, and during      his remarks I heard him say that he had conferred on the heads      of the Twelve Apostles all the keys and powers pertaining to the      Priesthood, and that upon the heads of the Twelve Apostles the      burden of the kingdom rested, and they would have to carry it.\"[5]      BENJAMIN F. JOHNSON'S TESTIMONY.    At the eighty-seventh birthday anniversary celebration of Elder  Benjamin F. Johnson, held at Mesa, Arizona, July 29, 1905, that  Patriarch said:        \"I speak of things of which I know I was the business partner of      Joseph Smith, from my mission until the time of his martyrdom, was      as familiar with him as with my brother or my father.        \"Do I know that Brigham Young was the true successor of Joseph      Smith? I knew it before the Prophet was martyred, for Joseph had      made it known. I was present when the Prophet gave his charge to      the Twelve Apostles, when in council, after solemn prayer, he rose      up with the light of heaven shining in his countenance, related      his experiences with reference to the beginning of this work, the      responsibilities placed upon him, the persecutions and hardships      through which he had passed. He declared that God had revealed all      the truth necessary to save mankind, had given unto him the keys      of the kingdom, and he had carried the weight and load thus far,      and then, speaking directly to the Twelve, he said: 'I now roll off      the burden of this responsibility upon you; I give unto you all the      keys and powers bestowed upon me, and I say unto you, that unless      you round up your shoulders and bear off this kingdom you will be      damned.\"      EZRA T. CLARK'S TESTIMONY.        \"Before I left Nauvoo, I heard the Prophet Joseph say he would give      the Saints a key whereby they would never be led away or deceived,      and that was: 'The Lord would never suffer the majority of this      people to be led away or deceived by imposters, nor would he allow      the records of this Church to fall into the hands of the enemy.'      I heard Joseph say this, and I also heard him say that he would      roll the burden of the Apostleship upon the quorum of the Twelve.      I heard Joseph preach many times; heard him in the last sermon he      ever delivered, bear testimony to the truth of the work that God      had called him to; also that the Lord had never suffered him to be      slain by his enemies, because his work had not been done, until a      short time ago. He had now laid the foundation of this work, and      rolled the burden of the Priesthood upon the Twelve; and having      given them their washings and anointings, they would now bear off      this work triumphantly, and it would roll on faster than ever      before; and, if the Lord was willing to accept him, he was willing      to go.\"--M. I. A. Era, Vol. 5: 202.      PROPERLY ORDAINED.    We will now consider the claim that Joseph Smith of the  \"Reorganization\" was properly ordained. We must first know what  constitutes a proper ordination.    First. It must be done by those holding authority in the Priesthood who  have been properly appointed; otherwise the ordination is not valid.    Second. The ordination must be approved by the body of the Church and  sanctioned by the Church, or it is not valid. For there is in the  Gospel the law of common consent. Doc. & Cov. Sec. 20:63, 65; 26:2.    Third, If a man exercises his Priesthood contrary to the rules of the  Church, or in unrighteousness, Amen to his authority.--Doc. & Cov.  121:27.    Fourth, \"Again, I say unto you, it shall not be given to any one to  go forth to preach my Gospel, or to build up my Church except he be  ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the Church  that he has authority, and has been regularly ordained by the heads of  the Church.\"--(Sec. 42:11).    The question is, will the ordination of Joseph Smith of the  \"Reorganization\" stand this test? He was \"ordained\" under the hands of  William Marks (mouth), Zenas H. Gurley, William W. Blair and Samuel  Powers. Messrs. Blair and Powers never did belong to the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so we will pass them by without  consideration, and will take up the cases of William Marks and Zenas H.  Gurley separately.    William Marks was president of the Nauvoo stake at the time of the  martyrdom, but it is of a more recent period that we are considering  him. Did he in 1860 hold the priesthood? William Marks was dropped from  his position as president of the Nauvoo stake at a conference of the  Church held October 7, 1844. (T. & S., 5: 692).    The whole Church voting not to sustain him, excepting two votes. This  action was taken because he supported the claims of Sidney Rigdon and  opposed the Twelve and action of the Church. In the December following  he acknowledged his error in the following:                                     NOTICE.        \"After mature and candid deliberation, I am fully and      satisfactorily convinced that Mr. Sidney Rigdon's claims to the      Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,      are not founded in truth. I have been deceived by his specious      pretenses and now feel to warn every one over whom I may have      any influence to beware of him, and his pretended visions and      revelations. The Twelve are the proper persons to lead the Church.\"                                                      \"WILLIAM MARKS.\"    After making this acknowledgment he was received back into fellowship,  but did not again obtain his former position. Later he became  dissatisfied and withdrew from the Church and was excommunicated.  During the exodus he joined James J. Strang, and in 1846 was called  to be a counselor to James J. Strang in his organization. (History  of \"Reorganized\" Church, 3:723). For a time he was also president  of Strang's \"Stake of Zion,\" and also a bishop in his organization  (History of \"Reorganized\" Church, 3:44 and 723). First a \"bishop,\" then  \"president of the 'Stake of Zion,' and then \"counselor\" in Strang's  presidency. In 1852 he became a member of Charles B. Thompson's church  (Reorg. Hist., 3:55 and 3:724). In 1855 he left Thompson and entered  into an organization with John E. Page and others (Reorg. Hist.,  3:724); and on June 11, 1859, he was received into the \"Reorganization\"  on his original baptism,\" \"and they recognized his original ordination  to the Priesthood, although he had been disfellowshiped by the church  that conferred that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#19)"],[1,"may have  honest differences of opinion. Partisan differences, however, did not cause  material disagreements as to the conduct of the war. Nor, in the conduct of  our international relations, during and since the war, have such partisan  differences been material.    On some domestic issues we may, and probably shall, disagree. That in  itself is not to be feared. It is inherent in our form of Government. But  there are ways of disagreeing; men who differ can still work together  sincerely for the common good. We shall be risking the Nation's safety and  destroying our opportunities for progress if we do not settle any  disagreements in this spirit, without thought of partisan advantage.    THE GENERAL DOMESTIC ECONOMY    As the year 1947 begins, the state of our national economy presents great  opportunities for all. We have virtually full employment. Our national  production of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year  prior to the war emergency. The national income in 1946 was higher than in  any peacetime year. Our food production is greater than it has ever been.  During the last 5 years our productive facilities have been expanded in  almost every field. The American standard of living is higher now than ever  before, and when the housing shortage can be overcome it will be even  higher.    During the past few months we have removed at a rapid rate the emergency  controls that the Federal Government had to exercise during the war. The  remaining controls will be retained only as long as they are needed to  protect the public. Private enterprise must be given the greatest possible  freedom to continue the expansion of economy.    In my proclamation of December 31, 1946 I announced the termination of  hostilities. This automatically ended certain temporary legislation and  certain executive powers.    Two groups of temporary laws still remain: the first are those which by  Congressional mandate are to last during the \"emergency\"; the second are  those which are to continue until the \"termination of the war,\"    I shall submit to the Congress recommendations for the repeal of certain of  the statutes which by their terms continue for the duration of the  \"emergency.\" I shall at the same time recommend that others within this  classification be extended until the state of war has been ended by treaty  or by legislative action. As to those statutes which continue until the  state of war has been terminated, I urge that the Congress promptly  consider each statute individually, and repeal such emergency legislation  where it is advisable.    Now that nearly all wartime controls have been removed, the operation of  our industrial system depends to a greater extent on the decisions of  businessmen, farmers, and workers. These decisions must be wisely made with  genuine concern for public welfare. The welfare of businessmen, farmers,  and workers depends upon the economic well-being of those who buy their  products.    An important present source of danger to our economy is the possibility  that prices might be raised to such an extent that the consuming public  could not purchase the tremendous volume of goods and services which will  be produced during 1947.    We all know that recent price increases have denied to many of our workers  much of the value of recent wage increases. Farmers have found that a large  part of their increased income has been absorbed by increased prices. While  some of our people have received raises in income which exceed price  increases, the great majority have not. Those persons who live on modest  fixed incomes--retired persons living on pensions, for example--and workers  whose incomes are relatively inflexible, such as teachers and other civil  servants--have suffered hardship.    In the effort to bring about a sound and equitable price structure, each  group of our population has its own responsibilities.    It is up to industry not only to hold the line on existing prices, but to  make reductions whenever profits justify such action.    It is up to labor to refrain from pressing for unjustified wage increases  that will force increases in the price level.    And it is up to Government to do everything in its power to encourage  high-volume Production, for that is what makes possible good wages, low  prices, and reasonable profits.    In a few days there will be submitted to the Congress the Economic Report  of the President, and also the Budget Message. Those messages will contain  many recommendations. Today I shall outline five major economic policies  which I believe the Government should pursue during 1947. These policies  are designed to meet our immediate needs and, at the same time, to provide  for the long-range welfare of our free enterprise system:    First, the promotion of greater harmony between labor and management.    Second, restriction of monopoly and unfair business practices; assistance  to small business; and the promotion of the free competitive system of  private enterprise.    Third, continuation of an aggressive program of home construction.    Fourth, the balancing of the budget in the next fiscal year and the  achieving of a substantial surplus to be applied to the reduction of the  public debt.    Fifth, protection of a fair level of return to farmers in post-war  agriculture.    LABOR AND MANAGEMENT    The year just past--like the year after the first World War--was marred by  labor management strife.    Despite this outbreak of economic warfare in 1946, we are today producing  goods and services in record volume. Nevertheless, it is essential to  improve the methods for reaching agreement between labor and management and  to reduce the number of strikes and lockouts.    We must not, however, adopt punitive legislation. We must not in order to  punish a few labor leaders, pass vindictive laws which will restrict the  proper rights of the rank and file of labor. We must not, under the stress  of emotion, endanger our American freedoms by taking ill-considered action  which will lead to results not anticipated or desired.    We must remember, in reviewing the record of disputes in 1946, that  management shares with labor the responsibility for failure to reach  agreements which would have averted strikes. For that reason, we must  realize that industrial peace cannot be achieved merely by laws directed  against labor unions.    During the last decade and a half, we have established a national labor  policy in this country based upon free collective bargaining as the process  for determining wages and working conditions.    That is still the national policy.    And it should continue to be the national policy!    But as yet, not all of us have learned what it means to bargain freely and  fairly. Nor have all of us learned to carry the mutual responsibilities  that accompany the right to bargain. There have been abuses and harmful  practices which limit the effectiveness of our system of collective  bargaining. Furthermore, we have lacked sufficient governmental machinery  to aid labor and management in resolving their differences.    Certain labor-management problems need attention at once and certain  others, by reason of their complexity, need exhaustive investigation and  study.    We should enact legislation to correct certain abuses and to provide  additional governmental assistance in bargaining. But we should also  concern ourselves with the basic causes of labor-management difficulties.    In the light of these considerations, I propose to you and urge your  cooperation in effecting the following four-point program to reduce  industrial strife:    Point number one is the early enactment of legislation to prevent certain  unjustifiable practices.    First, under this point, are jurisdictional strikes. In such strikes the  public and the employer are innocent bystanders who are injured by a  collision between rival unions. This type of dispute hurts production,  industry, and the public--and labor itself. I consider jurisdictional  strikes indefensible.    The National Labor Relations Act provides procedures for determining which  union represents employees of a particular employer. In some jurisdictional  disputes, however, minority unions strike to compel employers to deal with  them despite a legal duty to bargain with the majority union. Strikes to  compel an employer to violate the law are inexcusable. Legislation to  prevent such strikes is clearly desirable.    Another form of inter-union disagreement is the jurisdictional strike  involving the question of which labor union is entitled to perform a  particular task. When rival unions are unable to settle such disputes  themselves, provision must be made for peaceful and binding determination  of the issues.    A second unjustifiable practice is the secondary boycott, when used to  further jurisdictional disputes or to compel employers to violate the  National Labor Relations Act.    Not all secondary boycotts are unjustified. We must judge them on the basis  of their objectives. For example, boycotts intended to protect wage rates  and working conditions should be distinguished from those in furtherance of  jurisdictional disputes. The structure of industry sometimes requires  unions, as a matter of self-preservation, to extend the conflict beyond a  particular employer. There should be no blanket prohibition against  boycotts. The appropriate goal is legislation which prohibits secondary  boycotts in pursuance of unjustifiable objectives, but does not impair the  union's right to preserve its own existence and the gains made in genuine  collective bargaining.    A third practice that should be corrected is the use of economic force, by  either labor or management, to decide issues arising out of the  interpretation of existing contracts.    Collective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should be  faithfully adhered to by both parties. In the most"]]]
