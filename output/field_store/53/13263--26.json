The shoulders  are covered with long silky  hair like the front wings.  This is so  delicate that it becomes detached at the slightest touch of vine or  leaf.  The abdomen is slightly lighter in colour on top, and a  creamy tan beneath.  The legs are grey, and the feet to the first  joint tan, crossed by faint lines of brown.    The head is small, with big prominent eyes that see better by day  than most night moths; for Catocala takes precipitate flight at  the merest shadow.  The antennae are long, delicate and threadlike,  and must be broken very easily in the flight of the moth.  It is  nothing unusual to see them with one antenna shorter than the other,  half, or entirely gone; and a perfect specimen with both antennae,  and all the haif on its shoulders, is rare.  They have a long tongue  that uncoils like Lineata, and Celeus, so they are feeders, but not  of day, for they never take flight until evening, except when disturbed.  The male is smaller than the female, his fore-wings deeply flushed  with darker colour and the back brighter red with more black in the bands.    Neogama, another member of this family, is a degree smaller than Amatrix,  but of the same shape.  The fore-wings are covered with broken lines  of different colours, the groundwork grey, with gold flushings, the  lines and dots of the border very like the Sweetheart's.  The back  wings are pure gold, almost reddish, with dark brownish black bands,  and yellow borders.  The top of the abdomen is a grey-gold colour.  Underneath, the markings are nearly the same as Amatrix, but a gold  flush suffuses the moth.    There are numbers of these Catocala moths running the colour scheme  of-yellow, from pale chrome to umber.  Many shade from light pink  through the reds to a dark blood colour.  Then there is a smaller  number having brown back wings and with others they are white.    The only way I know to photograph them is to focus on some favourable  spot, mark the place your plate covers in length and width, and then  do your best to coax your subjects in range.  If they can be persuaded  to walk, they  will open their wings to a greater or less degree.  A  reproduction would do them no sort of justice unless the markings of  the back wings show.  It is on account of the gorgeous colourings of  these that scientists call the species 'afterwings.'    One would suppose that with so many specimens of this beautiful  species living with us and swarming the swamp close by, I would be  prepared to give their complete life history; but I know less  concerning them than any other moths common with us, and all the  scientific works I can buy afford little help.  Professional  lepidopterists dismiss them with few words.  One would-be authority  disposes of the species with half a dozen lines.  You can find at  least a hundred Catocala reproduced from museum specimens and their  habitat given, in the Holland \"Moth Book\", but I fail to learn what  I most desire to know: what these moths feed on; how late they  live; how their eggs appear; where they are deposited;  which is their caterpillar; what does it eat; and where and how  does it pupate.    Packard, in his \"Guide to the Study of Insects\", offers in  substance this much help upon the subject: \"The genus is  beautiful, the species numerous, of large size, often three-inch  expansion, and in repose form a flat roof.  The larva is elongate,  slender, flattened beneath and spotted with black, attenuated at  each end, with fleshy filaments on the sides above the legs, while  the head is flattened and rather forked above.  It feeds on trees  and rests attached to the trunks.  The pupa is covered with a bluish  efflorescence, enclosed in a slight cocoon of silk, spun amongst  leaves or bark.\"    This will tend to bear out my contention that scientific works are  not the help they should be to the Nature Lover.  Heaven save me  from starting to locate Catocala moths, eggs, caterpillars or  pupae on the strength of this information.  I might find moths by  accident; nothing on the subject of eggs; neither colour of  body, characteristics nor food, to help identify caterpillars;  for the statement, 'it feeds on trees,' cannot be considered  exactly illuminating when we remember the world full of trees on  which caterpillars are feeding; and should one search for cocoon  encased pupae among the leaves and bark of tree-tops or earth?    The most reliable information I have had, concerning these moths  of which I know least, comes from Professor Rowley.  He is the  only lepidopterist of four to whom I applied, who could tell me  any  of the things I am interested in knowing.  He writes in  substance: \"The Bride and Sweetheart are common northern species,  as are most of the other members of the group.  The Amatrix,  with its red wings, is called the Sweetheart because amor means  love, and red is love's own colour.  The caterpillar feeds on  willow.  The Catocala of the yellow \"after-wings\" is commonly  called the Bride, because Neogama, its scientific name, means  recently wedded.  Its caterpillar feeds on walnut leaves.    \"If you will examine the under side of the body of a Catocala moth  you will find near the junction of the thorax and abdomen on either  side, large open organs reminding one of the ears of a grasshopper,  which are on the sides of the first abdominal segment.  Examine  the bodies of Sphinges and other moths for these same openings.  They appear to be ears.  Catocala moths feed on juices, and live  most of the summer season.  Numbers of them have been found sipping  sap at a tree freshly  cut and you know we take them at night with  bait.    \"New Orleans sugar and cider or sugar and stale beer are the usual  baits.  This 'concoction'is put on the bodies of trees with a  brush, between eight and ten o'clock at night.  During good Catocala  years, great numbers of these moths may be taken as they feed at  the sweet syrup.  So it is proved that their food is sap, honeydew,  and other sugary liquids.  Mr. George Dodge assures me that he has  taken Catocala abbreviatella at milk-weed blooms about eight o'clock  of early July  evenings.  Other species also feed on flowers.\"    You will observe that in his remarks about the \"open organs on the  side of the abdominal segment,\"  Professor Rowley may have settled  the 'ear' question.  I am going to keep sharp watch for these organs,  hereafter.  I am led to wonder if one could close them in some way  and detect any difference in the moth's sense of hearing after  having done so.    All of us are enthusiasts about these moths with their modest  fore-wings and the gaudy brilliance of the wonderful 'after-wings,'  that are so bright as to give common name to the species.  We are  studying them constantly and hope soon to learn all we care to know  of any moths, for our experience with them is quite limited when  compared with other visitors from the swamp.  But think of  the poetry of adding to the long list of birds, animals and  insects that temporarily reside with us, a Sweetheart and a Bride!        CHAPTER X  The Giant Gamin: Telea Polyphemus      Time cannot be used to tell of making the acquaintance of this  moth until how well worth knowing it is has been explained.  That  it is a big birdlike fellow, with a six inch sweep of wing, is  indicated by the fact that it is named in honour of the giant  Polyphemus.  Telea means 'the end,' and as scientists fail to  explain the appropriateness of this, I am at liberty to indulge  a theory of my  own.  Nature made this handsome moth last, and  as it was the end, surpassed herself as a finishing touch on  creatures that are, no doubt, her frailest and most exquisite  creation.    Polyphemus is rich in shadings of many subdued colours, that so  blend and contrast as to give it no superior in the family of  short-lived lovers of moonlight.  Its front wings are a complicated  study of many colours, for some of which it would be difficult to  find a name.  Really, it is the one moth that must be seen and  studied in minutest detail to gain an idea of its beauty.  The  nearest I can come to the general groundwork of the wing is a  rich brown-yellow.  The costa is grey, this colour spreading in  a widening line from the base of the wing to more than a quarter  of an inch at the tip, and closely peppered with black.  At the  base, the wing is covered with silky  yellow-brown hairs.  As if  to outline the extent of these, comes a line of pinkish white,  and then one of rich golden brown, shading into the prevailing  colour.    Close the middle of the length of the wing, and half an inch from  the costa, is a transparent spot like isinglass, so clear that fine  print can be read through it.  This spot is outlined with a canary  yellow band, and that with a narrow, but sharp circle of black.  Then comes a cloudlike rift of golden brown, drifting from the  costa across the wing, but, growing fainter until it merges with  the general colour near the abdomen.  Then half an inch of the  yellow-brown colour is peppered with black, similar to the costa;  this grows darker until it terminates in a quarter of an inch wide  band of almost grey-black crossing the wing.  Next this comes a  narrower band of pinkish white.  The edge begins with a quarter  of an inch band of clear yellow-brown, and widens as the wing curves  until it is half an inch at the point.  It is the lightest colour  of rotten apple.  The only thing I ever have seen in nature exactly  similar was the palest shade of 'mother' found in barrels of vinegar.  A very light liver colour comes close it.  On the extreme tip is a  velvety oval, half black and half pale pink.    The back wings are the merest trifle stronger in this yellow-brown  colour, and with the exception of the brown rift are the same in  marking, only that all colour, similar to the brown, is a shade  deeper.    The 'piece de resistance' of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#19)"],[1,"another sentinel should  relieve me, the discovery of my breach of duty must be made, and my  punishment inevitable. His last words, however, were to assure me he  should return at the hour he had named, and when I closed the gate upon  him it was under the firm impression his absence would only prove of  the temporary nature he had stated.--Gentlemen,\" abruptly concluded  Halloway, \"I have nothing further to add; if I have failed in my duty  as a soldier, I have, at least, fulfilled that of a man; and although  the violation of the first entail upon me the punishment of death, the  motives which impelled me to that violation will not, I trust, be  utterly lost sight of by those by whom my punishment is to be awarded.\"    The candid, fearless, and manly tone in which Halloway had delivered  this long and singular statement, however little the governor appeared  to be affected by it, evidently made a deep impression on the court,  who had listened with undiverted attention to the close. Some  conversation again ensued, in a low tone, among several members, when  two slips of written paper were passed up, as before, to the president.  These elicited the following interrogatories:--    \"You have stated, prisoner, that Captain de Haldimar left the fort  accompanied by his servant Donellan. How were they respectively  dressed?\"    \"Captain de Haldimar in his uniform; Donellan, as far as I could  observe, in his regimental clothing also, with this difference, that he  wore his servant's round glazed hat and his grey great coat.\"    \"How then do you account for the extraordinary circumstance of Donellan  having been found murdered in his master's clothes? Was any allusion  made to a change of dress before they left the fort?\"    \"Not the slightest,\" returned the prisoner; \"nor can I in any way  account for this mysterious fact. When they quitted the garrison, each  wore the dress I have described.\"    \"In what manner did Captain de Haldimar and Donellan effect their  passage across the ditch?\" continued the president, after glancing at  the second slip of paper. \"The draw-bridge was evidently not lowered,  and there were no other means at hand to enable him to effect his  object with promptitude. How do you explain this, prisoner?\"    When this question was put, the whole body of officers, and the  governor especially, turned their eyes simultaneously on Halloway, for  on his hesitation or promptness in replying seemed to attach much of  the credit they were disposed to accord his statement. Halloway  observed it, and coloured. His reply, however, was free, unfaltering,  and unstudied.    \"A rope with which Donellan had provided himself, was secured to one of  the iron hooks that support the pullies immediately above the gate.  With this they swung themselves in succession to the opposite bank.\"    The members of the court looked at each other, apparently glad that an  answer so confirmatory of the truth of the prisoner's statement, had  been thus readily given.    \"Were they to have returned in the same manner?\" pursued the president,  framing his interrogatory from the contents of another slip of paper,  which, at the suggestion of the governor, had been passed to him by the  prosecutor, Mr. Lawson.    \"They were,\" firmly replied the prisoner. \"At least I presumed they  were, for, I believe in the hurry of Captain de Haldimar's departure,  he never once made any direct allusion to the manner of his return; nor  did it occur to me until this moment how they were to regain possession  of the rope, without assistance from within.\"    \"Of course,\" observed Colonel de Haldimar, addressing the president,  \"the rope still remains. Mr. Lawson, examine the gate, and report  accordingly.\"    The adjutant hastened to acquit himself of this laconic order, and soon  afterwards returned, stating not only that there was no rope, but that  the hook alluded to had disappeared altogether.    For a moment the cheek of the prisoner paled; but it was evidently less  from any fear connected with his individual existence, than from the  shame he felt at having been detected in a supposed falsehood. He  however speedily recovered his self-possession, and exhibited the same  character of unconcern by which his general bearing throughout the  trial had been distinguished.    On this announcement of the adjutant, the governor betrayed a movement  of impatience, that was meant to convey his utter disbelief of the  whole of the prisoner's statement, and his look seemed to express to  the court it should also arrive, and without hesitation, at the same  conclusion. Even all authoritative as he was, however, he felt that  military etiquette and strict discipline prevented his interfering  further in this advanced state of the proceedings.    \"Prisoner,\" again remarked Captain Blessington, \"your statement in  regard to the means employed by Captain de Haldimar in effecting his  departure, is, you must admit, unsupported by appearances. How happens  it the rope is no longer where you say it was placed? No one could have  removed it but yourself. Have you done so? and if so, can you produce  it, or say where it is to be found?\"    \"Captain Blessington,\" replied Halloway, proudly, yet respectfully, \"I  have already invoked that great Being, before whose tribunal I am so  shortly to appear, in testimony of the truth of my assertion; and  again, in his presence, do I repeat, every word I have uttered is true.  I did not remove the rope, neither do I know what is become of it. I  admit its disappearance is extraordinary, but a moment's reflection  must satisfy the court I would not have devised a tale, the falsehood  of which could at once have been detected on an examination such as  that which has just been instituted. When Mr. Lawson left this room  just now, I fully expected he would have found the rope lying as it had  been left. What has become of it, I repeat, I know not; but in the  manner I have stated did Captain de Haldimar and Donellan cross the  ditch. I have nothing further to add,\" he concluded once more, drawing  up his fine tall person, the native elegance of which could not be  wholly disguised even in the dress of a private soldier; \"nothing  further to disclose. Yet do I repel with scorn the injurious  insinuation against my fidelity, suggested in these doubts. I am  prepared to meet my death as best may become a soldier, and, let me  add, as best may become a proud and well born gentleman; but humanity  and common justice should at least be accorded to my memory. I am an  unfortunate man, but no traitor.\"    The members were visibly impressed by the last sentences of the  prisoner. No further question however was asked, and he was again  removed by the escort, who had been wondering spectators of the scene,  to the cell he had so recently occupied. The room was then cleared of  the witnesses and strangers, the latter comprising nearly the whole of  the officers off duty, when the court proceeded to deliberate on the  evidence, and pass sentence on the accused.          CHAPTER VII.    Although the young and sensitive De Haldimar had found physical relief  in the summary means resorted to by the surgeon, the moral wound at his  heart not only remained unsoothed, but was rendered more acutely  painful by the wretched reflections, which, now that he had full  leisure to review the past, and anticipate the future in all the gloom  attached to both, so violently assailed him. From the moment when his  brother's strange and mysterious disappearance had been communicated by  the adjutant in the manner we have already seen, his spirits had been  deeply and fearfully depressed. Still he had every reason to expect,  from the well-known character of Halloway, the strong hope expressed by  the latter might be realised; and that, at the hour appointed for  trial, his brother would be present to explain the cause of his  mysterious absence, justify the conduct of his subordinate, and  exonerate him from the treachery with which he now stood charged. Yet,  powerful as this hope was, it was unavoidably qualified by dispiriting  doubt; for a nature affectionate and bland, as that of Charles de  Haldimar, could not but harbour distrust, while a shadow of  uncertainty, in regard to the fate of a brother so tenderly loved,  remained. He had forced himself to believe as much as possible what he  wished, and the effort had, to a certain extent succeeded; but there  had been something so solemn and so impressive in the scene that had  passed when the prisoner was first brought up for trial, something so  fearfully prophetic in the wild language of his unhappy wife, he had  found it impossible to resist the influence of the almost superstitious  awe they had awakened in his heart.    What the feelings of the young officer were subsequently, when in the  person of the murdered man on the common, the victim of Sir Everard  Valletort's aim, he recognised that brother, whose disappearance had  occasioned him so much inquietude, we shall not attempt to describe:  their nature is best shown in the effect they produced--the almost  overwhelming agony of body and mind, which had borne him, like a  stricken plant, unresisting to the earth. But now that, in the calm and  solitude of his chamber, he had leisure to review the fearful events  conspiring to produce this extremity, his anguish of spirit was even  deeper than when the first rude shock of conviction had flashed upon  his understanding. A tide of suffering, that overpowered, without  rendering him sensible of its positive and abstract character, had, in  the first instance, oppressed his faculties, and obscured his  perception; but now, slow, sure, stinging, and gradually succeeding  each other, came every bitter thought and reflection of which that tide  was composed; and the generous heart of Charles de Haldimar was a prey  to feelings that would have wrung the soul, and wounded the"]]]
