Only one regiment of regular horse was sent from the mother country,  during the struggle. But legions and independent corps were formed in  different places, as it best accorded with the views of the royal  commanders, or suited the exigency of the times. These were not  unfrequently composed of men raised in the colonies, and at other times  drafts were had from the regiments of the line, and the soldiers were  made to lay aside the musket and bayonet, and taught to wield the saber  and carbine. One particular body of the subsidiary troops was included  in this arrange ment, and the Hessian yagers were transformed into a  corps of heavy and inactive horse.    Opposed to them were the hardiest spirits of America. Most of the  cavalry regiments of the continental army were led and officered by  gentlemen from the South. The high and haughty courage of the commanders  had communicated itself to the privates, who were men selected with care  and great attention to the service they were intended to perform.    While the British were confined to their empty conquests in the  possession of a few of the larger towns, or marched through counties  that were swept of everything like military supplies, the light troops  of their enemies had the range of the whole interior.    The sufferings of the line of the American army were great beyond  example; but possessing the power, and feeling themselves engaged in a  cause which justified severity, the cavalry officers were vigilant in  providing for their wants, and the horse were well mounted, well fed,  and consequently eminently effective. Perhaps the world could not  furnish more brave, enterprising, and resistless corps of light cavalry,  than a few that were in the continental service at the time of which  we write.    Dunwoodie's men had often tried their prowess against the enemy, and  they now sat panting to be led once more against foes whom they seldom  charged in vain. Their wishes were soon to be gratified; for their  commander had scarcely time to regain his seat in the saddle, before a  body of the enemy came sweeping round the base of the hill, which  intersected the view to the south. A few minutes enabled the major to  distinguish their character. In one troop he saw the green coats of the  Cowboys, and in the other the leathern helmets and wooden saddles of the  yagers. Their numbers were about equal to the body under his  immediate orders.    On reaching the open space near the cottage of Harvey Birch, the enemy  halted and drew up his men in line, evi dently making preparations for  a charge. At this moment a column of foot appeared in the vale, and  pressed forward to the bank of the brook we have already mentioned.    Major Dunwoodie was not less distinguished by coolness and judgment,  than, where occasion offered, by his dauntless intrepidity. He at once  saw his advantage, and determined to profit by it. The column he led  began slowly to retire from the field, when the youthful German, who  commanded the enemy's horse, fearful of missing an easy conquest, gave  the word to charge. Few troops were more hardy than the Cowboys; they  sprang eagerly forward in the pursuit, with a confidence created by the  retiring foe and the column in their rear; the Hessians followed more  slowly, but in better order. The trumpets of the Virginians now sounded  long and lively; they were answered by a strain from the party in ambush  that went to the hearts of their enemies. The column of Dunwoodie  wheeled in perfect order, opened, and, as the word to charge was given,  the troops of Lawton emerged from their cover, with their leader in  advance, waving his saber over his head, and shouting, in a voice that  was heard above the clangor of the martial music.    The charge threatened too much for the refugee troop. They scattered in  every direction, flying from the field as fast as their horses, the  chosen beasts of Westchester, could carry them. Only a few were hurt;  but such as did meet the arms of their avenging countrymen never  survived the blow, to tell who struck it. It was upon the poor vassals  of the German tyrant that the shock fell. Disciplined to the most exact  obedience, these ill-fated men met the charge bravely, but they were  swept before the mettled horses and nervous arms of their antagonists  like chaff before the wind. Many of them were literally ridden down, and  Dunwoodie soon saw the field without an opposing foe. The proximity of  the infantry prevented pursuit, and behind its column the few Hessians  who escaped unhurt sought protection.    The more cunning refugees dispersed in small bands, taking various and  devious routes back to their old station in front of Harlem. Many was  the sufferer, in cattle, furniture, and person, that was created by this  rout; for the dispersion of a troop of Cowboys was only the extension  of an evil.    Such a scene could not be expected to be acted so near them, and the  inmates of the cottage take no interest in the result. In truth, the  feelings it excited pervaded every bosom, from the kitchen to the  parlor. Terror and horror had prevented the ladies from being  spectators, but they did not feel the less. Frances continued lying in  the posture we have mentioned, offering up fervent and incoherent  petitions for the safety of her countrymen, although in her inmost heart  she had personified her nation by the graceful image of Peyton  Dunwoodie. Her aunt and sister were less exclusive in their devotions;  but Sarah began to feel, as the horrors of war were thus brought home to  her senses, less pleasure in her anticipated triumphs.    The inmates of Mr. Wharton's kitchen were four, namely, Caesar and his  spouse, their granddaughter, a jet-black damsel of twenty, and the boy  before alluded to. The blacks were the remnants of a race of negroes  which had been entailed on his estate from Mr. Wharton's maternal  ancestors, who were descended from the early Dutch colonists. Time,  depravity, and death had reduced them to this small number; and the boy,  who was white, had been added by Miss Peyton to the establishment, as an  assistant, to perform the ordinary services of a footman. Caesar, after  first using the precaution to place himself under the cover of an angle  in the wall, for a screen against any roving bullet which might be  traversing the air, became an amused spectator of the skirmish. The  sentinel on the piazza was at the distance of but a few feet from him,  and he entered into the spirit of the chase with all the ardor of a  tried bloodhound. He noticed the approach of the black, and his  judicious position, with a smile of contempt, as he squared himself  towards the enemy, offering his unprotected breast to any dangers which  might come.    After considering the arrangement of Caesar, for a moment, with  ineffable disdain, the dragoon said, with great coolness,--    \"You seem very careful of that beautiful person of yours, Mr. Blueskin.\"    \"A bullet hurt a colored man as much as a white,\" muttered the black,  surlily, casting a glance of much satisfaction at his rampart.    \"Suppose I make the experiment,\" returned the sentinel. As he spoke, he  deliberately drew a pistol from his belt, and leveled it at the black.  Caesar's teeth chattered at the appearance of the dragoon, although he  believed nothing serious was intended. At this moment the column of  Dunwoodie began to retire, and the royal cavalry commenced their charge.    \"There, Mister Light-Horseman,\" said Caesar eagerly, who believed the  Americans were retiring in earnest; \"why you rebels don't  fight--see--see how King George's men make Major Dunwoodie run! Good  gentleman, too, but he don't like to fight a rig'lar.\"    \"Damn your regulars,\" cried the other, fiercely. \"Wait a minute,  blackey, and you'll see Captain Jack Lawton come out from behind yonder  hill, and scatter these Cowboys like wild geese who've lost  their leader.\"    Caesar supposed the party under Lawton to have sought the shelter of the  hill from motives similar to that which had induced him to place the  wall between himself and the battle ground; but the fact soon verified  the trooper's prophecy, and the black witnessed with consternation the  total rout of the royal horse.    The sentinel manifested his exultation at the success of his comrades  with loud shouts, which soon brought his companion, who had been left in  the more immediate charge of Henry Wharton, to the open window of  the parlor.    \"See, Tom, see,\" cried the delighted trooper, \"how Captain Lawton makes  that Hessian's leather cap fly; and now the major has killed the  officer's horse--zounds, why didn't he kill the Dutchman and save  the horse?\"    A few pistols were discharged at the flying Cowboys, and a spent bullet  broke a pane of glass within a few feet of Caesar. Imitating the posture  of the great tempter of our race, the black sought the protection of the  inside of the building, and immediately ascended to the parlor.    The lawn in front of the Locusts was hidden from the view of the road by  a close line of shrubbery, and the horses of the two dragoons had been  left, linked together, under its shelter, to await the movements of  their masters.    At this moment two Cowboys, who had been cut off from a retreat to their  own party, rode furiously through the gate, with an intention of  escaping to the open wood in the rear of the cottage.    The victorious Americans pressed the retreating Germans until they had  driven them under the protection of the fire of the infantry; and  feeling themselves, in the privacy of the lawn, relieved from any  immediate danger, the predatory warriors yielded to a temptation that  few of the corps were ever known to resist--opportunity and horseflesh.  With a hardihood and presence of mind that could only exist from long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#19)"],[1,"of the vessels that carried them, and were then bought back  to freedom by their Jewish brethren.    This is a noble fact in Jewish history. But it is nevertheless true that  Jewish communities were reluctant in ordinary times to permit new  settlements. This was not so in ancient times. Among the Essenes, a  newcomer had a perfectly equal right to share everything with the old  inhabitants. These Essenes were great travellers, going from city to city,  probably with propagandist aims. In the Talmudic law there are very clear  rules on the subject of passers through a town or immigrants into it. By  that law persons staying in a place for less than thirty days were free  from all local dues except special collections for the poor. He who stayed  less than a year contributed to the ordinary poor relief, but was not taxed  for permanent objects, such as walling the town, defences, etc., nor did he  contribute to the salaries of teachers and officials, nor the building and  support of synagogues. But as his duties were small, so were his rights.  After a twelve months' stay he became a \"son of the city,\" a full member of  the community. But in the Middle Ages, newcomers, as already said, were not  generally welcome. The question of space was one important reason, for all  newcomers had to stay in the Ghetto. Secondly, the newcomer was not  amenable to discipline. Local custom varied much in the details both of  Jewish and general law. The new settler might claim to retain his old  customs, and the regard for local custom was so strong that the claim was  often allowed, to the destruction of uniformity and the undermining of  authority. To give an instance or two: A newcomer would insist that, as he  might play cards in his native town, he ought not to be expected to obey  puritanical restrictions in the place to which he came. The result was that  the resident Jews would clamor against foreigners enjoying special  privileges, as in this way all attempts to control gambling might be  defeated. Or the newcomer would claim to shave his beard in accordance with  his home custom, but to the scandal of the town which he was visiting. The  native young men would imitate the foreigner, and then there would be  trouble. Or the settler would assert his right to wear colors and fashions  and jewelry forbidden to native Jews. Again, the marriage problem was  complicated by the arrival of insinuating strangers, who turned out to be  married men masquerading as bachelors. Then as to public worship--the  congregation was often split into fragments by the independent services  organized by foreign groups, and it would become necessary to prohibit its  own members from attending the synagogues of foreign settlers. Then as to  communal taxes: these were fixed annually on the basis of the population,  and the arrival of newcomers seriously disturbed the equilibrium, led to  fresh exactions by the Government, which it was by no means certain the new  settlers could or would pay, and which, therefore, fell on the shoulders of  the old residents.    When we consider all these facts, we can see that the eagerness of the  medieval Jews to control the influx of foreign settlers was only in part  the result of base motives. And, of course, the exclusion was not permanent  or rigid. In Rome, the Sefardic and the Italian Jews fraternally placed  their synagogues on different floors of the same building. In some German  towns, the foreign synagogue was fixed in the same courtyard as the native.  Everywhere foreign Jews abounded, and everywhere a generous welcome awaited  the genuine traveller.    As to the travelling beggar, he was a perpetual nuisance. Yet he was  treated with much consideration. The policy with regard to him was, \"Send  the beggar further,\" and this suited the tramp, too. He did not wish to  settle, he wished to move on. He would be lodged for two days in the  communal inn, or if, as usually happened, he arrived on Friday evening, he  would be billeted on some hospitable member, or the Shamash would look  after him at the public expense. It is not till the thirteenth century that  we meet regular envoys sent from Palestine to collect money.    The genuine traveller, however, was an ever-welcome guest. If he came at  fair time, his way was smoothed for him. The Jew who visited the fair was  only rarely charged local taxes by the Synagogue. He deserved a welcome,  for he not only brought wares to sell, but he came laden with new books.  The fair was the only book-market At other times the Jews were dependent on  the casual visits of travelling venders of volumes. Book-selling does not  seem to have been a settled occupation in the Middle Ages. The merchant who  came to the fair also fulfilled another function--that of Shadchan. The day  of the fair was, in fact, the crisis of the year. Naturally, the  letter-carrier was eagerly received. In the early part of the eighteenth  century the function of conveying the post was sometimes filled by  Jewesses.    Even the ordinary traveller, who had no business to transact, would often  choose fair time for visiting new places, for he would be sure to meet  interesting people then. He, too, would mostly arrive on a Friday evening,  and would beguile the Sabbath with reports of the wonders he had seen. In  the great synagogue of Sepphoris, Jochanan was discoursing of the great  pearl, so gigantic in size that the Eastern gates of the Temple were to be  built of the single gem. \"Ay, ay,\" assented an auditor, who had been a  notorious skeptic until he had become a shipwrecked sailor, \"had not mine  own eyes beheld such a pearl in the ocean-bed, I should not have believed  it.\" And so the medieval traveller would tell his enthralling tales. He  would speak of a mighty Jewish kingdom in the East, existing in idyllic  peace and prosperity; he would excite his auditors with news of the latest  Messiah; he would describe the river Sambatyon, which keeps the Sabbath,  and, mingling truth with fiction, with one breath would truly relate how he  crossed a river on an inflated skin, and with the next breath romance about  Hillel's tomb, how he had been there, and how he had seen a large hollow  stone, which remains empty if a bad fellow enters, but at the approach of a  pious visitor fills up with sweet, pure water, with which he washes,  uttering a wish at the same time, sure that it will come true. It is  impossible even to hint at all the wonders of the tombs. Jews were ardent  believers in the supernatural power of sepulchres; they made pilgrimages to  them to pray and to beg favors. Jewish travellers' tales of the Middle Ages  are heavily laden with these legends. Of course, the traveller would also  bring genuine news about his brethren in distant parts, and sober  information about foreign countries, their ways, their physical  conformation, and their strange birds and beasts. These stories were in the  main true. For instance, Petachiah tells of a flying camel, which runs  fifteen times as fast as the fleetest horse. He must have seen an ostrich,  which is still called the flying camel by Arabs. But we cannot linger over  this matter. Suffice it to say that, as soon as Sabbath was over, the  traveller's narrative would be written out by the local scribe, and  treasured as one of the communal prizes. The traveller, on his part, often  kept a diary, and himself compiled a description of his adventures. In some  congregations there was kept a Communal Note-Book, in which were entered  decisions brought by visiting Rabbis from other communities.    The most welcome of guests, even more welcome than long-distance  travellers, or globe-trotters, were the Bachurim and travelling Rabbis. The  Talmudic Rabbis were most of them travellers. Akiba's extensive journeys  were, some think, designed to rouse the Jews of Asia Minor generally to  participate in the insurrection against Hadrian. But my narrative must be  at this point confined to the medieval students. For the Bachurim, or  students, there was a special house in many communities, and they lived  together with their teachers. In the twelfth century, the great academy of  Narbonne, under Abraham ibn Daud, attracted crowds of foreign students.  These, as Benjamin of Tudela tells us, were fed and clothed at the communal  cost. At Beaucaire, the students were housed and supported at the teacher's  expense. In the seventeenth century, the students not only were paid small  bursaries, but every household entertained one or more of them at table. In  these circumstances their life was by no means dull or monotonous. A Jewish  student endures much, but he knows how to get the best out of life. This  optimism, this quickness of humor, saved the Rabbi and his pupil from many  a melancholy hour. Take Abraham ibn Ezra, for instance. If ever a man was  marked out to be a bitter reviler of fate, it was he. But he laughed at  fate. He gaily wandered from his native Spain over many lands penniless,  travelled with no baggage but his thoughts, visited Italy and France, and  even reached London, where, perhaps, he died. Fortune ill-treated him, but  he found many joys. Wherever he went, patrons held out their hand.    Travelling students found many such generous lovers of learning, who, with  their wealth, encouraged their guests to write original works or copy out  older books, which the patrons then passed on to poor scholars in want of a  library. The legend is told, how the prophet Elijah visited Hebron, and was  not \"called up\" in the synagogue. Receiving no Aliyah on earth, he returned  to his elevation in Heaven. It was thus imprudent to deny honor to angels  unawares. Usually the scholar was treated as such a possible angel. When he  arrived, the whole congregation would turn out to meet him. He would be  taken in procession to the synagogue, where he would say the benediction  ha-Gomel, in thanks for his safety on the road. Perhaps he"]]]
