Had they not  chased the _Belvidera_ the Americans would probably have run  across the plate fleet.    The American squadron reached the western edge of the Newfoundland  Banks on June 29th, [Footnote: Letter of Commodore Rodgers, Sept.  1st.] and on July 1st, a little to the east of the Banks, fell in  with large quantities of cocoa-nut shells, orange peels, etc.,  which filled every one with great hopes of overtaking the quarry.  On July 9th, the _Hornet_ captured a British privateer, in latitude  45° 30' N., and longitude 23° W., and her master reported that he  had seen the Jamaica-men the previous evening; but nothing further  was heard or seen of them, and on July 13th, being within twenty  hours' sail of the English Channel, Commodore Rodgers reluctantly  turned southward, reaching Madeira July 21st. Thence he cruised  toward the Azores and by the Grand Banks home, there being  considerable sickness on the ships. On August 31st he reached  Boston after a very unfortunate cruise, in which he had made but  seven prizes, all merchant-men, and had recaptured one American vessel.    On July 3d the _Essex_, 32, Captain David Porter, put out of New  York. As has been already explained she was most inefficiently  armed, almost entirely with carronades. This placed her at the  mercy of any frigate with long guns which could keep at a distance  of a few hundred yards; but in spite of Captain Porter's petitions  and remonstrances he was not allowed to change his armament. On the  11th of July at 2 A. M., latitude 33° N., longitude 66° W., the  _Essex_ fell in with the _Minerva_, 32, Captain Richard Hawkins,  convoying seven transports, each containing about 200 troops, bound  from Barbadoes to Quebec. The convoy was sailing in open order,  and, there being a dull moon, the _Essex_ ran in and cut out  transport No. 299, with 197 soldiers aboard. Having taken out the  soldiers, Captain Porter stood back to the convoy, expecting  Captain Hawkins to come out and fight him; but this the latter  would not do, keeping the convoy in close order around him. The  transports were all armed and still contained in the aggregate  1,200 soldiers. As the _Essex_ could only fight at close quarters  these heavy odds rendered it hopeless for her to try to cut out  the _Minerva_. Her carronades would have to be used at short range  to be effective, and it would of course have been folly to run in  right among the convoy, and expose herself to the certainty of  being boarded by five times as many men as she possessed. The  _Minerva_ had three less guns a side, and on her spar-deck carried  24-pound carronades instead of 32's, and, moreover, had fifty men  less than the _Essex_, which had about 270 men this cruise; on the  other hand, her main-deck was armed with long 12's, so that it is  hard to say whether she did right or not in refusing to fight. She  was of the same force as the _Southampton_ whose captain, Sir James  Lucas Yeo, subsequently challenged Porter, but never appointed a  meeting-place. In the event of a meeting, the advantage, in ships  of such radically different armaments, would have been with that  captain who succeeded in outmanoeuvring the other and in making  the fight come off at the distance best suited to himself. At long  range either the _Minerva_ or _Southampton_ would possess an immense  superiority; but if Porter could have contrived to run up within  a couple of hundred yards, or still better, to board, his superiority  in weight of metal and number of men would have enabled him to carry  either of them. Porter's crew was better trained for boarding than  almost any other American commander's; and probably none of the  British frigates on the American station, except the _Shannon_ and  _Tenedos_, would have stood a chance with the _Essex_ in a  hand-to-hand struggle. Among her youngest midshipmen was one, by  name David Glasgow Farragut, then but thirteen years old, who  afterward became the first and greatest admiral of the United States.  His own words on this point will be read with interest. \"Every  day,\" he says, [Footnote: \"Life of Farragut\" (embodying his journal  and letters), p. 31. By his son, Loyall Farragut, New York. 1879.]  \"the crew were exercised at the great guns, small arms, and single  stick. And I may here mention the fact that I have never been on  a ship where the crew of the old _Essex_ was represented but that  I found them to be the best swordsmen on board. They had been so  thoroughly trained as boarders that every man was prepared for  such an emergency, with his cutlass as sharp as a razor, a dirk  made by the ship's armorer out of a file, and a pistol.\" [Footnote:  James says: \"Had Captain Porter really endeavored to bring the  _Minerva_ to action we do not see what could have prevented the  _Essex_ with her superiority of sailing, from coming alongside of  her. But no such thought, we are sure, entered into Captain Porter's  head.\" What \"prevented the _Essex_\" was the _Minerva's_ not  venturing out of the convoy. Farragut, in his journal writes: \"The  captured British officers were very anxious for us to have a fight  with the _Minerva_, as they considered her a good match for the  _Essex_, and Captain Porter replied that he should gratify them  with pleasure if his majesty's commander was of their taste. So  we stood toward the convoy and when within gunshot hove to, and  awaited the _Minerva_, but she tacked and stood in among the convoy,  to the utter amazement of our prisoners, who denounced the commander  as a base coward, and expressed their determination to report him  to the Admiralty.\" An incident of reported \"flinching\" like this  is not worth mentioning; I allude to it only to show the value of  James' sneers.]    On August 13th a sail was made out to windward, which proved to be  the British ship-sloop _Alert_, 16, Captain T. L. O. Laugharne,  carrying 20 eighteen-pound carronades and 100 men. [Footnote:  James (History, vi, p. 128) says \"86 men.\" In the Naval Archives  at Washington in the \"Captains' Letters\" for 1812 (vol. n. No.  182) can be found enclosed in Porter's letter the parole of the  officers and crew of the _Alert_ signed by Captain Laugharne; it  contains either 100 or 101 names of the crew of the _Alert_ besides  those of a number of other prisoners sent back in the same cartel.]  As soon as the _Essex_ discovered the _Alert_ she put out drags  astern, and led the enemy to believe she was trying to escape by  sending a few men aloft to shake out the reefs and make sail.  Concluding the frigate to be a merchant-man, the _Alert_ bore down  on her; while the Americans went to quarters and cleared for action,  although the tompions were left in the guns, and the ports kept  closed. [Footnote: \"Life of Farragut,\" p. 16.] The _Alert_ fired  a gun and the _Essex_ hove to, when the former passed under her  stern, and when on her lee quarter poured in a broadside of grape  and canister; but the sloop was so far abaft the frigate's beam  that her shot did not enter the ports and caused no damage.  Thereupon Porter put up his helm and opened as soon as his guns  would bear, tompions and all. The _Alert_ now discovered her error  and made off, but too late, for in eight minutes the _Essex_ was  along side, and the _Alert_ fired a musket and struck, three men  being wounded and several feet of water in the hold. She was  disarmed and sent as a cartel into St. Johns. It has been the  fashion among American writers to speak of her as if she were  \"unworthily\" given up, but such an accusation is entirely  groundless. The _Essex_ was four times her force, and all that  could possibly be expected of her was to do as she did--exchange  broadsides and strike, having suffered some loss and damage. The  _Essex_ returned to New York on September 7th, having made 10  prizes, containing 423 men. [Footnote: Before entering New York  the _Essex_ fell in with a British force which, in both Porter's  and Farragut's works, is said to have been composed of the  _Acasta_ and _Shannon_, each of fifty guns, and _Ringdove_, of  twenty. James says it was the _Shannon_, accompanied by a merchant  vessel. It is not a point of much importance, as nothing came of  the meeting, and the _Shannon_, alone, with her immensely superior  armament, ought to have been a match twice over for the _Essex_:  although, if James is right, as seems probable, it gives rather a  comical turn to Porter's account of his \"extraordinary escape.\"]    The _Belvidera_, as has been stated, carried the news of the war  to Halifax. On July 5th Vice-Admiral Sawyer despatched a squadron  to cruise against the United States, commanded by Philip Vere  Broke, of the _Shannon_, 38, having under him the _Belvidera_, 36,  Captain Richard Byron, _Africa_, 64, Captain John Bastard, and  _Aeolus_. 32, Captain Lord James Townsend. On the 9th, while off  Nantucket, they were joined by the _Guerrière_, 38, Captain James  Richard Dacres. On the 16th the squadron fell in with and captured  the United States brig _Nautilus_, 14, Lieutenant Crane, which,  like all the little brigs, was overloaded with guns and men. She  threw her lee guns overboard and made use of every expedient to  escape, but to no purpose. At 3 P.M. of the following day, when  the British ships were abreast of Barnegat, about four leagues  off shore, a strange sail was seen and immediately chased, in the  south by east, or windward quarter, standing to the northeast.  This was the United States frigate _Constitution_, 44, Captain  Isaac Hull. [Footnote: For the ensuing chase I have relied mainly  on Cooper; see also \"Memoir of Admiral Broke,\" p. 240; James, vi,  133: and Marshall's \"Naval Biography\" (London, 1825), ii. 625.]  When the war broke out he was in the Chesapeake River getting a  new crew aboard. Having shipped over 450 men (counting officers),  he put out of harbor on the 12th of July.

'I should think if he were living,  he would have heard you by this time.'    'In his fits of laziness, he sleeps so desperate hard,' said the  distracted host, 'that if you were to fire off cannon-balls into his  ears, it wouldn't wake him, sir.'    The guest made no remark upon this novel cure for drowsiness, and recipe  for making people lively, but, with his hands clasped behind him, stood  in the porch, very much amused to see old John, with the bridle in his  hand, wavering between a strong impulse to abandon the animal to his  fate, and a half disposition to lead him into the house, and shut him up  in the parlour, while he waited on his master.    'Pillory the fellow, here he is at last!' cried John, in the very height  and zenith of his distress. 'Did you hear me a calling, villain?'    The figure he addressed made no answer, but putting his hand upon the  saddle, sprung into it at a bound, turned the horse's head towards the  stable, and was gone in an instant.    'Brisk enough when he is awake,' said the guest.    'Brisk enough, sir!' replied John, looking at the place where the horse  had been, as if not yet understanding quite, what had become of him. 'He  melts, I think. He goes like a drop of froth. You look at him, and there  he is. You look at him again, and--there he isn't.'    Having, in the absence of any more words, put this sudden climax to what  he had faintly intended should be a long explanation of the whole life  and character of his man, the oracular John Willet led the gentleman up  his wide dismantled staircase into the Maypole's best apartment.    It was spacious enough in all conscience, occupying the whole depth of  the house, and having at either end a great bay window, as large as many  modern rooms; in which some few panes of stained glass, emblazoned  with fragments of armorial bearings, though cracked, and patched, and  shattered, yet remained; attesting, by their presence, that the former  owner had made the very light subservient to his state, and pressed the  sun itself into his list of flatterers; bidding it, when it shone into  his chamber, reflect the badges of his ancient family, and take new hues  and colours from their pride.    But those were old days, and now every little ray came and went as it  would; telling the plain, bare, searching truth. Although the best room  of the inn, it had the melancholy aspect of grandeur in decay, and was  much too vast for comfort. Rich rustling hangings, waving on the walls;  and, better far, the rustling of youth and beauty's dress; the light of  women's eyes, outshining the tapers and their own rich jewels; the sound  of gentle tongues, and music, and the tread of maiden feet, had once  been there, and filled it with delight. But they were gone, and with  them all its gladness. It was no longer a home; children were never born  and bred there; the fireside had become mercenary--a something to be  bought and sold--a very courtezan: let who would die, or sit beside, or  leave it, it was still the same--it missed nobody, cared for nobody,  had equal warmth and smiles for all. God help the man whose heart ever  changes with the world, as an old mansion when it becomes an inn!    No effort had been made to furnish this chilly waste, but before the  broad chimney a colony of chairs and tables had been planted on a square  of carpet, flanked by a ghostly screen, enriched with figures, grinning  and grotesque. After lighting with his own hands the faggots which were  heaped upon the hearth, old John withdrew to hold grave council with his  cook, touching the stranger's entertainment; while the guest himself,  seeing small comfort in the yet unkindled wood, opened a lattice in the  distant window, and basked in a sickly gleam of cold March sun.    Leaving the window now and then, to rake the crackling logs together,  or pace the echoing room from end to end, he closed it when the fire was  quite burnt up, and having wheeled the easiest chair into the warmest  corner, summoned John Willet.    'Sir,' said John.    He wanted pen, ink, and paper. There was an old standish on the  mantelshelf containing a dusty apology for all three. Having set this  before him, the landlord was retiring, when he motioned him to stay.    'There's a house not far from here,' said the guest when he had written  a few lines, 'which you call the Warren, I believe?'    As this was said in the tone of one who knew the fact, and asked the  question as a thing of course, John contented himself with nodding his  head in the affirmative; at the same time taking one hand out of his  pockets to cough behind, and then putting it in again.    'I want this note'--said the guest, glancing on what he had written, and  folding it, 'conveyed there without loss of time, and an answer brought  back here. Have you a messenger at hand?'    John was thoughtful for a minute or thereabouts, and then said Yes.    'Let me see him,' said the guest.    This was disconcerting; for Joe being out, and Hugh engaged in rubbing  down the chestnut cob, he designed sending on the errand, Barnaby, who  had just then arrived in one of his rambles, and who, so that he thought  himself employed on a grave and serious business, would go anywhere.    'Why the truth is,' said John after a long pause, 'that the person who'd  go quickest, is a sort of natural, as one may say, sir; and though quick  of foot, and as much to be trusted as the post itself, he's not good at  talking, being touched and flighty, sir.'    'You don't,' said the guest, raising his eyes to John's fat face, 'you  don't mean--what's the fellow's name--you don't mean Barnaby?'    'Yes, I do,' returned the landlord, his features turning quite  expressive with surprise.    'How comes he to be here?' inquired the guest, leaning back in his  chair; speaking in the bland, even tone, from which he never varied; and  with the same soft, courteous, never-changing smile upon his face. 'I  saw him in London last night.'    'He's, for ever, here one hour, and there the next,' returned old John,  after the usual pause to get the question in his mind. 'Sometimes he  walks, and sometimes runs. He's known along the road by everybody, and  sometimes comes here in a cart or chaise, and sometimes riding double.  He comes and goes, through wind, rain, snow, and hail, and on the  darkest nights. Nothing hurts HIM.'    'He goes often to the Warren, does he not?' said the guest carelessly.  'I seem to remember his mother telling me something to that effect  yesterday. But I was not attending to the good woman much.'    'You're right, sir,' John made answer, 'he does. His father, sir, was  murdered in that house.'    'So I have heard,' returned the guest, taking a gold toothpick from his  pocket with the same sweet smile. 'A very disagreeable circumstance for  the family.'    'Very,' said John with a puzzled look, as if it occurred to him, dimly  and afar off, that this might by possibility be a cool way of treating  the subject.    'All the circumstances after a murder,' said the guest soliloquising,  'must be dreadfully unpleasant--so much bustle and disturbance--no  repose--a constant dwelling upon one subject--and the running in and  out, and up and down stairs, intolerable. I wouldn't have such a thing  happen to anybody I was nearly interested in, on any account. 'Twould  be enough to wear one's life out.--You were going to say, friend--' he  added, turning to John again.    'Only that Mrs Rudge lives on a little pension from the family, and that  Barnaby's as free of the house as any cat or dog about it,' answered  John. 'Shall he do your errand, sir?'    'Oh yes,' replied the guest. 'Oh certainly. Let him do it by all means.  Please to bring him here that I may charge him to be quick. If he  objects to come you may tell him it's Mr Chester. He will remember my  name, I dare say.'    John was so very much astonished to find who his visitor was, that he  could express no astonishment at all, by looks or otherwise, but left  the room as if he were in the most placid and imperturbable of all  possible conditions. It has been reported that when he got downstairs,  he looked steadily at the boiler for ten minutes by the clock, and all  that time never once left off shaking his head; for which statement  there would seem to be some ground of truth and feasibility, inasmuch  as that interval of time did certainly elapse, before he returned with  Barnaby to the guest's apartment.    'Come hither, lad,' said Mr Chester. 'You know Mr Geoffrey Haredale?'    Barnaby laughed, and looked at the landlord as though he would say,  'You hear him?' John, who was greatly shocked at this breach of decorum,  clapped his finger to his nose, and shook his head in mute remonstrance.    'He knows him, sir,' said John, frowning aside at Barnaby, 'as well as  you or I do.'    'I haven't the pleasure of much acquaintance with the gentleman,'  returned his guest. 'YOU may have. Limit the comparison to yourself, my  friend.'    Although this was said with the same easy affability, and the same  smile, John felt himself put down, and laying the indignity at Barnaby's  door, determined to kick his raven, on the very first opportunity.    'Give that,' said the guest, who had by this time sealed the note, and  who beckoned his messenger towards him as he spoke, 'into Mr Haredale's  own hands. Wait for an answer, and bring it back to me here. If you  should find that Mr Haredale is engaged just now, tell him--can he  remember a message, landlord?'    'When he chooses, sir,' replied John. 'He won't forget this one.'    'How are you sure of that?'    John merely pointed to him as he stood with his head bent forward, and  his earnest gaze fixed closely on his questioner's face; and nodded  sagely.    'Tell him then, Barnaby, should he be engaged,' said Mr Chester, 'that  I shall be glad to wait his convenience here, and to see him (if he will  call) at any"]]]
