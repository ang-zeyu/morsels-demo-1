"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9173"],[0,"Youth: Its Education, Regimen, and Hygiene (#19)"],[1," conflict. I do not underestimate the many and great difficulties of  proper purgation, but I know from both personal practise and  observation that they are not unconquerable.    This form of personal conflict is better than dueling even in its  comparatively harmless German student form, although this has been  warmly defended by Jacob Grimm, Bismarck, and Treitschke, while  Paulsen, Professor of Philosophy and Pedagogy, and Schrempf, of  Theology, have pronounced it but a slight evil, and several Americans  have thought it better than hazing, which it makes impossible. The  dark side of dueling is seen in the hypertrophied sense of honor which  under the code of the corps becomes an intricate and fantastic thing,  prompting, according to Ziegler,[12] a club of sixteen students to  fight over two hundred duels in four weeks in Jena early in this  century. It is prone to degenerate to an artificial etiquette  demanding satisfaction for slight and unintended offenses. Although  this professor who had his own face scarred on the _mensur_, pleaded  for a student court of honor, with power to brand acts as infamous and  even to expel students, on the ground that honor had grown more  inward, the traditions in favor of dueling were too strong. The duel  had a religious romantic origin as revealing God's judgment, and means  that the victim of an insult is ready to stake body, or even life, and  this is still its ideal side. Anachronism as it now is and  degenerating readily to sport or spectacle, overpunishing what is  often mere awkwardness or ignorance, it still impresses a certain  sense of responsibility for conduct and gives some physical training,  slight and specialized though it be. The code is conventional, drawn  directly from old French military life, and is not true to the line  that separates real honor from dishonor, deliberate insult that wounds  normal self-respect from injury fancied by oversensitiveness or  feigned by arrogance; so that in its present form it is not the best  safeguard of the sacred shrine of personality against invasion of ifs  rights. If, as is claimed, it is some diversion from or fortification  against corrosive sensuality, it has generally allied itself with  excessive beer-drinking. Fencing, while an art susceptible of high  development and valuable for both pose and poise, and requiring great  quickness of eye, arm, and wrist, is unilateral and robbed of the vest  of inflicting real pain on an antagonist.    Bushido,[13] which means military-knightly ways, designates the  Japanese conception of honor in behavior and in fighting. The youth is  inspired by the ideal of Tom Brown \"to leave behind him the name of a  fellow who never bullied a little boy or turned his back on a big  one.\" It expresses the race ideal of justice, patriotism, and the duty  of living aright and dying nobly. It means also sympathy, pity, and  love, for only the bravest can be the tenderest, and those most in  love are most daring, and it includes politeness and the art of  poetry. Honor is a sense of personal dignity and worth, so the _bushi_  is truthful without an oath. At the tender age of five the _samurai_  is given a real sword, and this gives self-respect and responsibility.  At fifteen, two sharp and artistic ones, long and short, are given  him, which must be his companions for life. They were made by a smith  whose shop is a sanctuary and who begins his work with prayer. They  have the finest hilts and scabbards, and are besung as invested with a  charm or spell, and symbolic of loyalty and self-control, for they  must never be drawn lightly. He is taught fencing, archery,  horsemanship, tactics, the spear, ethics and literature, anatomy, for  offence and defense; he must be indifferent to money, hold his life  cheap beside honor, and die if it is gone. This chivalry is called the  soul of Japan, and if it fades life is vulgarised. It is a code of  ethics and physical training.    Football is a magnificent game if played on honor. An English tennis  champion was lately playing a rubber game with the American champion.  They were even and near the end when the American made a bad fluke  which would have lost this country its championship. The English  player, scorning to win on an accident, intentionally made a similar  mistake that the best man might win. The chief evil of modern American  football which now threatens its suppression in some colleges is the  lust to win at any price, and results in tricks and secret practise.  These sneaky methods impair the sentiment of honor which is the best  and most potent of all the moral safeguards of youth, so that a young  man can not be a true gentleman on the gridiron. This ethical  degeneration is far worse than all the braises, sprains, broken bones  and even deaths it causes.    Wrestling is a form of personal encounter which in antiquity reached a  high development, and which, although now more known and practised as  athletics of the body than of the soul, has certain special  disciplinary capacities in its various forms. It represents the most  primitive type of the struggle of unarmed and unprotected man with  man. Purged of its barbarities, and in its Greco-Roman form and  properly subject to rules, it cultivates more kinds of movements than  any other form--for limbs, trunk, neck, hand, foot, and all in the  upright and in every prone position. It, too, has its manual of  feints, holds, tricks, and specialties, and calls out wariness,  quickness, strength, and shiftiness. Victory need involve no cruelty  or even pain to the vanquished. The very closeness of body to body,  emphasizing flexor rather than extensor arm muscles, imparts to it a  peculiar tone, gives it a vast variety of possible activities,  developing many alternatives at every stage, and tempts to many  undiscovered forms of permanent mayhem. Its struggle is usually longer  and less interrupted by pauses than pugilism, and its situations and  conclusions often develop slowly, so that all in all, its character  among contests is unique. As a school of posture for art, its  varieties are extremely manifold and by no means developed, for it  contains every kind of emphasis of every part and calls out every  muscle group and attitude of the human body; hence its training is  most generic and least specialized, and victories have been won by  very many kinds of excellence.    Perhaps nothing is more opposed to the idea of a gentleman than the  _saeva animi tempestas_ [Fierce tempest of the soul] of anger. A testy,  quarrelsome, mucky humor is antisocial, and an outburst of rage is  repulsive. Even non-resistance, turning the other cheek, has its  victories and may be a method of moral combat. A strong temper well  controlled and kept in leash makes a kinetic character; but in view of  bullying, unfair play, cruel injustice to the weak and defenseless, of  outrageous wrong that the law can not reach, patience and forbearance  may cease to be virtues, and summary redress may have a distinct  advantage to the ethical nature of man and to social order, and the  strenuous soul must fight or grow stagnant or flabby. If too  repressed, righteous indignation may turn to sourness and sulks, and  the disposition be spoiled. Hence the relief and exhilaration of an  outbreak that often clears the psychic atmosphere like a thunderstorm,  and gives the \"peace that passeth understanding\" so often dilated on  by our correspondents. Rather than the abject fear of making enemies  whatever the provocation, I would praise those whose best title of  honor is the kind of enemies they make. Better even an occasional nose  dented by a fist, a broken bone, a rapier-scarred face, or even  sometimes the sacrifice of the life of one of our best academic youth  than stagnation, general cynicism and censoriousness, bodily and  psychic cowardice, and moral corruption, if this indeed be, as it  sometimes is, its real alternative.    So closely are love and war connected that not only is individual  pugnacity greatly increased at the period of sexual maturity, when  animals acquire or develop horns, fangs, claws, spurs, and weapons of  offense and defense, but a new spirit of organization arises which  makes teams possible or more permanent. Football, baseball, cricket,  etc., and even boating can become schools of mental and moral  training. First, the rules of the game are often intricate, and to  master and observe them effectively is no mean training for the mind  controlling the body. These are steadily being revised and improved,  and the reasons for each detail of construction and conduct of the  game require experience and insight into human nature. Then the  subordination of each member to the whole and to a leader cultivates  the social and cooperative instincts, while the honor of the school,  college, or city, which each team represents, is confided to each and  all. Group loyalty in Anglo-Saxon games, which shows such a marked  increment in coordination and self-subordination at the dawn of  puberty as to constitute a distinct change in the character of sports  at this age, can be so utilized as to develop a spirit of service and  devotion not only to town, country, and race, but to God and the  church. Self must be merged and a sportsmanlike spirit cultivated that  prefers defeat to tricks and secret practise, and a clean game to the  applause of rooters and fans, intent only on victory, however won. The  long, hard fight against professionalism that brings in husky muckers,  who by every rule of true courtesy and chivalry belong outside  academic circles, scrapping and underhand advantages, is a sad comment  on the character and spirit of these games, and eliminates the best of  their educational advantages. The necessity of intervention, which has  imposed such great burdens on faculties and brought so much friction  with the frenzy of scholastic sentiment in the hot stage of seasonal"]]]
