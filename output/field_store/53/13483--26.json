I hold  those phenomena to be alike feeble and fugitive; but only so by reason  of their being openly so proclaimed; for mankind have a tendency to the  absurd, if their imaginations are not properly directed; and one of the  uses of poetry is, to keep the faculty in a healthy state, and cause it  to know its duties. Dante, in the fierce egotism of his passions, and  the strange identification of his knowledge with all that was knowable,  would fain have made his poetry both a sword against individuals, and a  prop for the support of the superstition that corrupted them. This was  reversing the duty of a Christian and a great man; and there happen to  be existing reasons why it is salutary to chew that he had no right to  do so, and must not have his barbarism confounded with his strength.  Machiavelli was of opinion, that if Christianity had not reverted to its  first principles, by means of the poverty and pious lives of St. Francis  and St. Dominic,[2] the faith would have been lost. It may have been;  but such are not the secrets of its preservation in times of science and  progression, when the spirit of inquiry has established itself among  all classes, and nothing is taken for granted, as it used to be. A few  persons here and there, who confound a small superstitious reaction in  England with the reverse of the fact all over the rest of Europe, may  persuade themselves, if they please, that the world has not advanced in  knowledge for the last three centuries, and so get up and cry aloud to  us out of obsolete horn-books; but the community laugh at them. Every  body else is inquiring into first principles, while they are dogmatising  on a forty-ninth proposition. The Irish themselves, as they ought to do,  care more for their pastors than for the Pope; and if any body wishes to  know what is thought of his Holiness at head-quarters, let him consult  the remarkable and admirable pamphlet which has lately issued from the  pen of Mr. Mazzini.[3] I have the pleasure of knowing excellent Roman  Catholics; I have suffered in behalf of their emancipation, and would do  so again to-morrow; but I believe that if even their external form of  Christianity has any chance of survival three hundred years hence, it  will have been owing to the appearance meanwhile of some extraordinary  man in power, who, in the teeth of worldly interests, or rather in  charitable and sage inclusion of them, shall have proclaimed that the  time had arrived for living in the flower of Christian charity, instead  of the husks and thorns which may have been necessary to guard it. If it  were possible for some new and wonderful Pope to make this change, and  draw a line between these two Christian epochs, like that between the  Old and New Testaments, the world would feel inclined to prostrate  itself again and for ever at the feet of Rome. In a catholic state  of things like that, delighted should I be, for one, to be among the  humblest of its communicants. How beautiful would their organs be then!  how ascending to an unperplexing Heaven their incense! how unselfish  their salvation! how intelligible their talk about justice and love! It  would be far more easy, however, for the Church of England to do this  than the Church of Rome; since the former would not feel itself hampered  with pretensions to infallibility. A Church once reformed, may reform  itself again and again, till it remove every blemish in the way of its  perfection. And God grant this may be the lot of the Church of my native  country. Its beautiful old ivied places of worship would then want  no harmony of accordance with its gentle and tranquil scenery; no  completeness of attraction to the reflecting and the kind.    But if Charity (and by Charity I do not mean mere toleration, or any  other pretended right to permit others to have eyes like ourselves, but  whatever the delightful Greek word implies of good and lovely), if this  truly and only divine consummation of all Christian doctrine be not  thought capable of taking a form of belief \"strong\" enough, apart from  threats that revolt alike the heart and the understanding, Superstition  must look out for some new mode of dictation altogether; for the world  is outgrowing the old.           *       *       *       *       *    I cannot, in gratitude for the facilities afforded to myself, as well  as for a more obvious and public reason, dismiss this Preface without  congratulating men of letters on the establishment and increasing  prosperity of the _London Library_, an institution founded for the  purpose of accommodating subscribers with such books, at their own  houses, as could only be consulted hitherto at the British Museum. The  sole objection to the Museum is thus done away, and the literary world  has a fair prospect of possessing two book-institutions instead of one,  each with its distinct claims to regard, and presenting in combination  all that the student can wish; for while it is highly desirable that  authors should be able to have standard works at their command, when  sickness or other circumstances render it impossible for them to go to  the Museum, it is undoubtedly requisite that one great collection should  exist in which they are sure to find the same works unremoved, in case  of necessity,--not to mention curious volumes of all sorts, manuscripts,  and a world of books of reference.

DANTE      Critical Notice    OF    DANTE'S LIFE AND GENIUS.[1]      Dante was a very great poet, a man of the strongest passions, a claimant  of unbounded powers to lead and enlighten the world; and he lived in a  semi-barbarous age, as favourable to the intensity of his imagination,  as it was otherwise to the rest of his pretensions. Party zeal, and the  fluctuations of moral and critical opinion, have at different periods  over-rated and depreciated his memory; and if, in the following attempt  to form its just estimate, I have found myself compelled, in some  important respects, to differ with preceding writers, and to protest in  particular against his being regarded as a proper teacher on any one  point, poetry excepted, and as far as all such genius and energy cannot  in some degree help being, I have not been the less sensible of the  wonderful nature of that genius, while acting within the circle to which  it belongs. Dante was indeed so great a poet, and at the same time  exhibited in his personal character such a mortifying exception to what  we conceive to be the natural wisdom and temper of great poets; in  other words, he was such a bigoted and exasperated man, and sullied  his imagination with so much that is contradictory to good feeling, in  matters divine as well as human; that I should not have thought myself  justified in assisting, however humbly, to extend the influence of his  writings, had I not believed a time to have arrived, when the community  may profit both from the marvels of his power and the melancholy  absurdity of its contradictions.    Dante Alighieri, who has always been known by his Christian rather than  surname (partly owing to the Italian predilection for Christian names,  and partly to the unsettled state of patronymics in his time), was the  son of a lawyer of good family in Florence, and was born in that city on  the 14th of May 1265 (sixty-three years before the birth of Chaucer).  The stock is said to have been of Roman origin, of the race of the  Frangipani; but the only certain trace of it is to Cacciaguida, a  Florentine cavalier of the house of the Elisei, who died in the  Crusades. Dante gives an account of him in his _Paradiso_.[2]  Cacciaguida married a lady of the Alighieri family of the Valdipado;  and, giving the name to one of his children, they subsequently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#2)"],[1,"brother and sister?\"    \"You're talkin' a little more'n sisterly, Kate.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Ay, ay! What do I mean! And now you're all red. Kate, I got an idea  it's nigh onto time to let Dan start on his way.\"    He could not have found a surer way to drive the crimson from her face  and turn it white to the lips.    \"Dad!\"    \"Well, Kate?\"    \"You wouldn't send Dan away!\"    Before he could answer she dropped her head against his shoulder  and broke into great sobs. He stroked her head with his calloused,  sunburned hand and his eyes filmed with a distant gaze.    \"I might have knowed it!\" he said over and over again; \"I might have  knowed it! Hush, my silly gal.\"    Her sobbing ceased with magic suddenness.    \"Then you won't send him away?\"    \"Listen to me while I talk to you straight,\" said Joe Cumberland,  \"and accordin' to the way you take it will depend whether Dan goes or  stays. Will you listen?\"    \"Dear Dad, with all my heart!\"    \"Humph!\" he grunted, \"that's just what I don't want. This what I'm  goin' to tell you is a queer thing--a mighty lot like a fairy tale,  maybe. I've kept it back from you years an' years thinkin' you'd find  out the truth about Dan for yourself. But bein' so close to him has  made you sort of blind, maybe! No man will criticize his own hoss.\"    \"Go on, tell me what you mean. I won't interrupt.\"    He was silent for a moment, frowning to gather his thoughts.    \"Have you ever seen a mule, Kate?\"    \"Of course!\"    \"Maybe you've noticed that a mule is just as strong as a horse--\"    \"Yes.\"    \"--but their muscles ain't a third as big?\"    \"Yes, but what on earth--\"    \"Well, Kate, Dan is built light an' yet he's stronger than the biggest  men around here.\"    \"Are you going to send him away simply because he's strong?\"    \"It doesn't show nothin',\" said the old man gently, \"savin' that he's  different from the regular run of men--an' I've seen a considerable  pile of men, honey. There's other funny things about Dan maybe you  ain't noticed. Take the way he has with hosses an' other animals. The  wildest man-killin', spur-hatin' bronchos don't put up no fight when  them long legs of Dan settle round 'em.\"    \"Because they know fighting won't help them!\"    \"Maybe so, maybe so,\" he said quietly, \"but it's kind of queer, Kate,  that after most a hundred men on the best hosses in these parts had  ridden in relays after Satan an' couldn't lay a rope on him, Dan could  jest go out on foot with a halter an' come back in ten days leadin'  the wildest devil of a mustang that ever hated men.\"    \"It was a glorious thing to do!\" she said.    Old Cumberland sighed and then shook his head.    \"It shows more'n that, honey. There ain't any man but Dan that can sit  the saddle on Satan. If Dan should die, Satan wouldn't be no more use  to other men than a piece of haltered lightnin'. An' then tell me how  Dan got hold of that wolf, Black Bart, as he calls him.\"    \"It isn't a wolf, Dad,\" said Kate, \"it's a dog. Dan says so himself.\"    \"Sure he says so,\" answered her father, \"but there was a lone wolf  prowlin' round these parts for a considerable time an' raisin' Cain  with the calves an' the colts. An' Black Bart comes pretty close to a  description of the lone wolf. Maybe you remember Dan found his 'dog'  lyin' in a gully with a bullet through his shoulder. If he was a dog  how'd he come to be shot--\"    \"Some brute of a sheep herder may have done it. What could it prove?\"    \"It only proves that Dan is queer--powerful queer! Satan an' Black  Bart are still as wild as they ever was, except that they got one  master. An' they ain't got a thing to do with other people. Black  Bart'd tear the heart out of a man that so much as patted his head.\"    \"Why,\" she cried, \"he'll let me do anything with him!\"    \"Humph!\" said Cumberland, a little baffled; \"maybe that's because Dan  is kind of fond of you, gal, an' he has sort of introduced you to  his pets, damn 'em! That's just the pint! How is he able to make his  man-killers act sweet with you an' play the devil with everybody  else.\"    \"It wasn't Dan at all!\" she said stoutly, \"and he _isn't_ queer. Satan  and Black Bart let me do what I want with them because they know I  love them for their beauty and their strength.\"    \"Let it go at that,\" growled her father. \"Kate, you're jest like your  mother when it comes to arguin'. If you wasn't my little gal I'd say  you was plain pig-headed. But look here, ain't you ever felt that Dan  is what I call him--different? Ain't you ever seen him get mad--jest  for a minute--an' watched them big brown eyes of his get all packed  full of yellow light that chases a chill up and down your back like a  wrigglin' snake?\"    She considered this statement in a little silence.    \"I saw him kill a rattler once,\" she said in a low voice. \"Dan caught  him behind the head after he had struck. He did it with his bare hand!  I almost fainted. When I looked again he had cut off the head of the  snake. It was--it was terrible!\"    She turned to her father and caught him firmly by the shoulders.    \"Look me straight in the eye, Dad, and tell me just what you mean.\"    \"Why, Kate,\" said the wise old man, \"you're beginnin' to see for  yourself what I'm drivin' at! Haven't you got somethin' else right on  the tip of your tongue?\"    \"There was one day that I've never told you about,\" she said in a low  voice, looking away, \"because I was afraid that if I told you, you'd  shoot Black Bart. He was gnawing a big beef bone and just for fun I  tried to take it away from him. He'd been out on a long trail with Dan  and he was very hungry. When I put my hand on the bone he snapped.  Luckily I had a thick glove on and he merely pinched my wrist. Also  I think he realized what he was doing for otherwise he'd have cut  through the glove as if it had been paper. He snarled fearfully and I  sprang back with a cry. Dan hadn't seen what happened, but he  heard the snarl and saw Black Bart's bared teeth. Then--oh, it was  terrible!\"    She covered her face.    \"Take your time, Kate,\" said Cumberland softly.    \"'Bart,' called Dan,\" she went on, \"and there was such anger in his  face that I think I was more afraid of him than of the big dog.    \"Bart turned to him with a snarl and bared his teeth. When Dan saw  that his face turned--I don't know how to say it!\"    She stopped a moment and her hands tightened.    \"Back in his throat there came a sound that was almost like the snarl  of Black Bart. The wolf-dog watched him with a terror that was uncanny  to see, the hair around his neck fairly on end, his teeth still bared,  and his growl horrible.    \"'Dan!' I called, 'don't go near him!'    \"I might as well have called out to a whirlwind. He leaped. Black Bart  sprang to meet him with eyes green with fear. I heard the loud click  of his teeth as he snapped--and missed. Dan swerved to one side and  caught Black Bart by the throat and drove him into the dust, falling  with him.    \"I couldn't move. I was weak with horror. It wasn't a struggle between  a man and a beast. It was like a fight between a panther and a wolf.  Black Bart was fighting hard but fighting hopelessly. Those hands were  settling tighter on his throat. His big red tongue lolled out; his  struggles almost ceased. Then Dan happened to glance at me. What he  saw in my face sobered him. He got up, lifting the dog with him, and  flung away the lifeless weight of Bart. He began to brush the dust  from his clothes, looking down as if he were ashamed. He asked me if  the dog had hurt me when he snapped. I could not speak for a moment.  Then came the most horrible part. Black Bart, who must have been  nearly killed, dragged himself to Dan on his belly, choking and  whining, and licked the boots of his master!\"    \"Then you _do_ know what I mean when I say Dan is--different?\"    She hesitated and blinked, as if she were shutting her eyes on a fact.  \"I _don't_ know. I know that he's gentle and kind and loves you more  than you love him.\" Her voice broke a little. \"Oh, Dad, you forget the  time he sat up with you for five days and nights when you got sick out  in the hills, and how he barely managed to get you back to the house  alive!\"    The old man frowned to conceal how greatly he was moved.    \"I haven't forgot nothin', Kate,\" he said, \"an' everything is for his  own good. Do you know what I've been tryin' to do all these years?\"    \"What?\"    \"I've been tryin' to hide him from himself! Kate, do you remember how I found him?\"    \"I was too little to know. I've heard you tell a little about it. He  was lost on the range. You found him twenty miles south of the house.\"    \"Lost on the range?\" repeated her father softly. \"I don't think he  could ever have been lost. To a hoss the corral is a home. To us our  ranch is a home. To Dan Barry the whole mountain-desert is a home!  This is how I found him. It was in the spring of the year when the  wild geese was honkin' as they flew north. I was ridin' down a gulley  about sunset and wishin' that I was closer to the ranch when I heard a  funny, wild sort of whistlin' that didn't have any tune to it that  I recognized. It gave me a queer feelin'. It made me think of fairy  stories--an' things like that! Pretty soon I seen a figure on the  crest of the hill. There was a triangle of geese away up overhead an'  the boy was walkin' along lookin' up as if he was followin' the trail  of the wild geese.    \"He was up there walkin' between the sunset an' the stars with his  head bent back, and his hands stuffed into his pockets, whistlin' as  if he was goin' home from school. An' such whistlin'.\"    \"Nobody could ever whistle like Dan,\" she said, and smiled.    \"I rode up to him, wonderin',\" went on Cumberland.    \"'What're you doin' round here?' I says.    \"Says he, lookin' at me casual like over his shoulder: 'I'm jest  takin' a stroll an' whistlin'. Does it bother you, mister?'    \"'It doesn't bother me none,' says I. 'Where"]]]
