'Yes,' shouted Charteris. 'What is it? Don't come in. I'm changing.'    The melodious treble of Master Crowinshaw, his fag, made itself heard  through the keyhole.    'The Head told me to tell you that he wanted to see you at the School  House as soon as you can go.'    'All right,' shouted Charteris. 'Thanks.'    'Now what,' he continued to himself, 'does the Old Man want to see me  for? Perhaps he wants to make certain that I've bathed my cheek in warm  water. Anyhow, I suppose I must go.'    A quarter of an hour later he presented himself at the Headmagisterial  door. The sedate Parker, the Head's butler, who always filled Charteris  with a desire to dig him hard in the ribs just to see what would  happen, ushered him into the study.    The Headmaster was reading by the light of a lamp when Charteris came  in. He laid down his book, and motioned him to a seat; after which  there was an awkward pause.    'I have just received,' began the Head at last, 'a most unpleasant  communication. Most unpleasant. From whom it comes I do not know. It  is, in fact--er--anonymous. I am sorry that I ever read it.'    He stopped. Charteris made no comment. He guessed what was coming. He,  too, was sorry that the Head had ever read the letter.    'The writer says that he saw you, that he actually spoke to you, at the  athletic sports at Rutton yesterday. I have called you in to tell me if  that is true.' The Head fastened an accusing eye on his companion.    'It is quite true, sir,' said Charteris steadily.    'What!' said the Head sharply. 'You were at Rutton?'    'Yes, sir.'    'You were perfectly aware, I suppose, that you were breaking the School  rules by going there, Charteris?' enquired the Head in a cold voice.    'Yes, sir.' There was another pause.    'This is very serious,' began the Head. 'I cannot overlook this. I--'    There was a slight scuffle of feet in the passage outside. The door  flew open vigorously, and a young lady entered. It was, as Charteris  recognized in a minute, his acquaintance of the afternoon, the young  lady of the bicycle.    'Uncle,' she said, 'have you seen my book anywhere?'    'Hullo!' she broke off as her eye fell on Charteris.    'Hullo!' said Charteris, affably, not to be outdone in the courtesies.    'Did you catch your train?'    'No. Missed it.'    'Hullo! what's the matter with your cheek?'    'I got a kick on it.'    'Oh, does it hurt?'    'Not much, thanks.'    Here the Head, feeling perhaps a little out of it, put in his oar.    'Dorothy, you must not come here now. I am busy. And how, may I ask, do  you and Charteris come to be acquainted?'    'Why, he's him,' said Dorothy lucidly.    The Head looked puzzled.    'Him. The chap, you know.'    It is greatly to the Head's credit that he grasped the meaning of these  words. Long study of the classics had quickened his faculty for seeing  sense in passages where there was none. The situation dawned upon him.    'Do you mean to tell me, Dorothy, that it was Charteris who came to  your assistance yesterday?'    Dorothy nodded energetically.    'He gave the men beans,' she said. 'He did, really,' she went on,  regardless of the Head's look of horror. 'He used right and left with  considerable effect.'    Dorothy's brother, a keen follower of the Ring, had been good enough  some days before to read her out an extract from an account in _The  Sportsman_ of a match at the National Sporting Club, and the account  had been much to her liking. She regarded it as a masterpiece of  English composition.    'Dorothy,' said the Headmaster, 'run away to bed.' A suggestion which  she treated with scorn, it wanting a clear two hours to her legal  bedtime. 'I must speak to your mother about your deplorable habit of  using slang. Dear me, I must certainly speak to her.'    And, shamefully unabashed, Dorothy retired.    The Head was silent for a few minutes after she had gone; then he  turned to Charteris again.    'In consideration of this, Charteris, I shall--er--mitigate slightly  the punishment I had intended to give you.'    Charteris murmured his gratification.    'But,' continued the Head sternly, 'I cannot overlook the offence. I  have my duty to consider. You will therefore write me--er--ten lines of  Virgil by tomorrow evening, Charteris.'    'Yes, sir.'    'Latin _and_ English,' said the relentless pedagogue.    'Yes, sir.'    'And, Charteris--I am speaking now--er--unofficially, not as a  headmaster, you understand--if in future you would cease to break  School rules simply as a matter of principle, for that, I fancy, is what  it amounts to, I--er--well, I think we should get on better together.  And that is, on my part at least, a consummation--er--devoutly to be  wished. Good-night, Charteris.'    'Good-night, sir.'    The Head extended a large hand. Charteris took it, and his departure.    The Headmaster opened his book again, and turned over a new leaf.  Charteris at the same moment, walking slowly in the direction of  Merevale's, was resolving for the future to do the very same thing. And  he did.          [9]    HOW PAYNE BUCKED UP      It was Walkinshaw's affair from the first. Grey, the captain of the St  Austin's Fifteen, was in the infirmary nursing a bad knee. To him came  Charles Augustus Walkinshaw with a scheme. Walkinshaw was football  secretary, and in Grey's absence acted as captain. Besides these two  there were only a couple of last year's team left--Reade and Barrett,  both of Philpott's House.    'Hullo, Grey, how's the knee?' said Walkinshaw.    'How's the team getting on?' he said.    'Well, as far as I can see,' said Walkinshaw, 'we ought to have a  rather good season, if you'd only hurry up and come back. We beat a  jolly hot lot of All Comers yesterday. Smith was playing for them. The  Blue, you know. And lots of others. We got a goal and a try to  _nil_.'    'Good,' said Grey. 'Who did anything for us? Who scored?'    'I got in once. Payne got the other.'    'By Jove, did he? What sort of a game is he playing this year?'    The moment had come for Walkinshaw to unburden himself to his scheme.  He proceeded to do so.    'Not up to much,' he said. 'Look here, Grey, I've got rather an idea.  It's my opinion Payne's not bucking up nearly as much as he might. Do  you mind if I leave him out of the next game?'    Grey stared. The idea was revolutionary.    'What! Leave him out? My good man, he'll be the next chap to get his  colours. He's a cert. for his cap.'    'That's just it. He knows he's a cert., and he's slacking on the  strength of it. Now, my idea is that if you slung him out for a match  or two, he'd buck up extra hard when he came into the team again. Can't  I have a shot at it?'    Grey weighed the matter. Walkinshaw pressed home his arguments.    'You see, it isn't like cricket. At cricket, of course, it might put a  chap off awfully to be left out, but I don't see how it can hurt a  man's play at footer. Besides, he's beginning to stick on side  already.'    'Is he, by Jove?' said Grey. This was the unpardonable sin. 'Well, I'll  tell you what you can do if you like. Get up a scratch game, First  Fifteen _v._ Second, and make him captain of the Second.'    'Right,' said Walkinshaw, and retired beaming.    Walkinshaw, it may be remarked at once, to prevent mistakes, was a  well-meaning idiot. There was no doubt about his being well-meaning.  Also, there was no doubt about his being an idiot. He was continually  getting insane ideas into his head, and being unable to get them out  again. This matter of Payne was a good example of his customary  methods. He had put his hand on the one really first-class forward St  Austin's possessed, and proposed to remove him from the team. And yet  through it all he was perfectly well-meaning. The fact that personally  he rather disliked Payne had, to do him justice, no weight at all with  him. He would have done the same by his bosom friend under like  circumstances. This is the only excuse that can be offered for him. It  was true that Payne regarded himself as a certainty for his colours, as  far as anything can be considered certain in this vale of sorrow. But  to accuse him of trading on this, and, to use the vernacular, of  putting on side, was unjust to a degree.    On the afternoon following this conversation Payne, who was a member of  Dacre's House, came into his study and banged his books down on the  table with much emphasis. This was a sign that he was feeling  dissatisfied with the way in which affairs were conducted in the world.  Bowden, who was asleep in an armchair--he had been staying in with a  cold--woke with a start. Bowden shared Payne's study. He played centre  three-quarter for the Second Fifteen.    'Hullo!' he said.    Payne grunted. Bowden realized that matters had not been going well  with him. He attempted to soothe him with conversation, choosing what  he thought would be a congenial topic.    'What's on on Saturday?' he asked.    'Scratch game. First _v._ Second.'    Bowden groaned.    'I know those First _v._ Second games,' he said. 'They turn the  Second out to get butchered for thirty-five minutes each way, to  improve the First's combination. It may be fun for the First, but it's  not nearly so rollicking for us. Look here, Payne, if you find me with  the pill at any time, you can let me down easy, you know. You needn't  go bringing off any of your beastly gallery tackles.'    'I won't,' said Payne. 'To start with, it would be against rules. We  happen to be on the same side.'    'Rot, man; I'm not playing for the First.' This was the only  explanation that occurred to him.    'I'm playing for the Second.'    'What! Are you certain?'    'I've seen the list. They're playing Babington instead of me.'    'But why? Babington's no good.'    'I think they have a sort of idea I'm slacking or something.

'Oh Lord!' groaned Drake and, pulling himself together,  set out painfully once more across the heavy surface of the field.    Jim lay where he was a little longer. The recollection of the other  runners, who might be expected to arrive shortly, stirred him to  action. He did not wish to interview everyone on the subject of his  dropping out. He struck off at right angles towards the hedge on the  left. As he did so, the first of the crowd entered the field. Simpson  _major_, wearing the colours of Perkins's House on his manly  bosom, was leading. Behind him came a group of four, two School House,  Dallas of Ward's, and a representative of Prater's. A minute later they  were followed by a larger group, consisting this time of twenty or more  runners--all that was left of the fifty who had started. The rest had  dropped out at the sight of the ploughed field.    Jim watched the procession vanish over the brow of the hill, and, as it  passed out of sight, began to walk slowly back to the School again.    He reached it at last, only to find it almost entirely deserted. In  Merevale's House there was nobody. He had hoped that Charteris and Tony  might have been somewhere about. When he had changed into his ordinary  clothes, he made a tour of the School grounds. The only sign of life,  as far as he could see, was Biffen, who was superintending the cutting  of the grass on the cricket-field. During the winter Biffen always  disappeared, nobody knew where, returning at the beginning of Sports  Week to begin preparations for the following cricket season. It had  been stated that during the winter he shut himself up and lived on  himself after the fashion of a bear. Others believed that he went and  worked in some Welsh mine until he was needed again at the School.  Biffen himself was not communicative on the subject, a fact which led a  third party to put forward the awful theory that he was a professional  association player and feared to mention his crime in a school which  worshipped Rugby.    'Why, Mr Thomson,' he said, as Jim came up, 'I thought you was running.  Whoa!' The last remark was addressed to a bored-looking horse attached  to the mowing-machine. From the expression on its face, the animal  evidently voted the whole process pure foolishness. He pulled up  without hesitation, and Biffen turned to Jim again.    'Surely they ain't come back yet?' he said.    'I have,' said Jim. 'I did myself up rather in the mile yesterday, and  couldn't keep up the pace. I dropped out at that awfully long ploughed  field by Parker's Spinney.'    Biffen nodded.    'And 'oo was winning, sir?'    'Well, Welch was leading, the last I saw of it. Shouldn't wonder if he  won either. He was going all right. I say, the place seems absolutely  deserted. Isn't anybody about?'    'Just what Mr MacArthur was saying to me just this minute, sir. 'E  went into the Pavilion.'    'Good. I'll go and hunt for him.'    Biffen 'clicked' the _blase_ horse into movement again. Jim went  to the Pavilion and met the Babe coming down the steps.    'Hullo, Babe! I was looking for you.'    'Hullo! Why aren't you running?'    'Dropped out. Come and have tea in my study.'    'No, I'll tell you what. You come back with me. I've got rather a  decent dog I want to show you. Only got him yesterday.'    Jim revelled in dogs, so he agreed instantly. The Babe lived with his  parents in a big house about a mile from the College, and in so doing  was the object of much envy amongst those who had to put up with life  at the Houses. Jim had been to his home once or twice before, and had  always had a very good time indeed there. The two strolled off. In  another hour the place began to show signs of life again. The School  began to return by ones and twos, most of them taking up a position  near the big gates. This was where the race was to finish. There was a  straight piece of road about two hundred yards in length before the  high road was reached. It was a sight worth seeing when the runners,  paced by their respective Houses on each side of the road, swept round  the corner, and did their best to sprint with all that was left in them  after ten miles of difficult country. Suddenly a distant shouting began  to be heard. The leaders had been sighted. The noise increased, growing  nearer and nearer, until at last it swelled into a roar, and a black  mass of runners turned the corner. In the midst of the black was one  white figure--Welch, as calm and unruffled as if he had been returning  from a short trot to improve his wind. Merevale's surged round him in a  cheering mob. Welch simply disregarded them. He knew where he wished to  begin his sprint, and he would begin it at that spot and no other. The  spot he had chosen was well within a hundred yards from the gates. When  he reached it, he let himself go, and from the uproar, the crowd  appeared to be satisfied. A long pause, and still none of the other  runners appeared. Five minutes went by before they began to appear.  First Jones, of the School House, and Simpson, who raced every yard of  the way, and finished in the order named, and then three of Philpott's  House in a body. The rest dropped in at intervals for the next quarter  of an hour.    The Headmaster always made a point of watching the finish of the  cross-country run. Indeed, he was generally one of the last to leave.  With the majority of the spectators it was enough to see the first five  safely in.    The last man and lock-up arrived almost simultaneously, and the Head  went off to a well-earned dinner.    He had just finished this meal, and was congratulating himself on not  being obliged to spend the evening in a series of painful interviews,  as had happened the night before, when Parker, the butler, entered the  room.    'Well, Parker, what is it?' asked he.    'Mr Roberts, sir, wishes to see you.'    For a moment the Head was at a loss. He could not recall any friend or  acquaintance of that name. Then he remembered that Roberts was the name  of the detective who had come down from London to look into the matter  of the prizes.    'Very well,' he said, resignedly, 'show him into the study.'    Parker bowed, and retired. The Head, after an interval, followed him,  and made his way to the study.          [15]    MR ROBERTS EXPLAINS      Inspector Roberts was standing with his back to the door, examining a  photograph of the College, when the Head entered. He spun round  briskly. 'Good evening, Mr Roberts. Pray be seated. You wish to see  me?'    The detective took a seat.    'This business of the cups, sir.'    'Ah!' said the Head, 'have you made any progress?'    'Considerable. Yes, very considerable progress. I've found out who  stole them.'    'You have?' cried the Head. 'Excellent. I suppose it _was_  Thomson, then? I was afraid so.'    'Thomson, sir? That was certainly not the name he gave me. Stokes he  called himself.'    'Stokes? Stokes? This is curious. Perhaps if you were to describe his  appearance? Was he a tall boy, of a rather slight build--'    The detective interrupted.    'Excuse me, sir, but I rather fancy we have different persons in our  mind. Stokes is not a boy. Not at all. Well over thirty. Red moustache.  Height, five foot seven, I should say. Not more. Works as a farmhand  when required, and does odd jobs at times. That's the man.'    The Head's face expressed relief, as he heard this description. 'Then  Thomson did not do it after all,' he said.    'Thomson?' queried Mr Roberts.    'Thomson,' explained the Head, 'is the name of one of the boys at the  School. I am sorry to say that I strongly suspected him of this  robbery.'    'A boy at the School. Curious. Unusual, I should have thought, for a  boy to be mixed up in an affair like this. Though I have known cases.'    'I was very unwilling, I can assure you, to suspect him of such a  thing, but really the evidence all seemed to point to it. I am afraid,  Mr Roberts, that I have been poaching on your preserves without much  success.'    'Curious thing evidence,' murmured Mr Roberts, fixing with his eye a  bust of Socrates on the writing-desk, as if he wished it to pay  particular attention to his words. 'Very curious. Very seldom able to  trust it. Case the other day. Man charged with robbery from the person.  _With violence_. They gave the case to me. Worked up beautiful  case against the man. Not a hitch anywhere. Whole thing practically  proved. Man brings forward _alibi._ Proves it. Turned out that at  time of robbery he had been serving seven days without the option for  knocking down two porters and a guard on the District Railway. Yet the  evidence seemed conclusive. Yes, curious thing evidence.' He nodded  solemnly at Socrates, and resumed an interested study of the carpet.    The Head, who had made several spirited attempts at speaking during  this recital, at last succeeded in getting in a word.    'You have the cups?'    'No. No, cups still missing. Only flaw in the affair. Perhaps I had  better begin from the beginning?'    'Exactly. Pray let me hear the whole story. I am more glad than I can  say that Thomson is innocent. There is no doubt of that, I hope?'    'Not the least, sir. Not the very least. Stokes is the man.'    'I am very glad to hear it.'    The inspector paused for a moment, coughed, and drifted into his  narrative.    '... Saw at once it was not the work of a practised burglar. First  place, how could regular professional know that the cups were in the  Pavilion at all? Quite so. Second place, work very clumsily done. No  neatness. Not the professional touch at all. Tell it in a minute. No  mistaking it. Very good. Must, therefore, have been amateur--this night  only--and connected with School. Next question, who? Helped a little  there by luck. Capital thing luck, when it's not bad luck. Was passing  by the village inn--you know the village inn, I dare say, sir?'    The Head, slightly scandalized, explained that he "]]]
