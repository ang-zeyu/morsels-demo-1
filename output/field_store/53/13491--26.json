As for the wild riders from the cattle ranges, they drew into a close  group with the ringmaster between them and the gaunt stallion, almost as  if the fearless ones were seeking for protection. But the announcer  himself lost his almost invincible _sang-froid_; in all his matchless  vocabulary there were no sounding phrases ready for this occasion, and  little Werther strutted in the centre of the great arena, rising to his  opportunity.    He imitated the ringmaster's phraseology. \"La-a-a-dies and gen'l'mun,  the price has gone up. The 'death-defyin', dare-devils that laugh at  danger' ain't none too ready to ride my hoss. Maybe the price is too low  for 'em. It's raised. One thousand dollars--cash--for any man in  hearin' of me that'll ride my pet.\"    There was a stir among the cattlemen, but still none of them moved  forward toward the great horse; and as if he sensed his victory he  raised and shook his ugly head and neighed. A mighty laugh answered that  challenge; this was a sort of \"horse-humour\" that great New York could  not overlook, and in that mirth even the big grey man, Drew, joined. The  laughter stopped with an amazing suddenness making the following silence  impressive as when a storm that has roared and howled about a house  falls mute, then all the dwellers in the house look to one another and  wait for the voice of the thunder. So all of New York that sat in the  long galleries of the Garden hushed its laughter and looked askance at  one another and waited. The big grey man rose and cursed softly.    For the slender young fellow in evening dress at whom the stallion had  rushed a moment before was stripping off his coat, his vest, and rolling  up the stiff cuffs of his sleeves. Then he dropped a hand on the edge of  the box, vaulted lightly into the arena, and walked straight toward the  horse.          CHAPTER II      SPORTING CHANCE    It might easily have been made melodramatic by any hesitation as he  approached, but, with a businesslike directness, he went right up to the  men who held the fighting horse.    He said: \"Put a saddle on him, boys, and I'll try my hand.\"    They could not answer at once, for Werther's \"pet,\" as if he recognized  the newcomer, made a sudden lunge and was brought to a stop only after  he had dragged his sweating handlers around and around in a small  circle. Here Werther himself came running up, puffing with surprise.    \"Son,\" he said eagerly, \"I'm not aiming to do you no harm. I was only  calling the bluff of those four-flushers.\"    The slender youth finished rolling up his left sleeve and smiled down at  the other.    \"Put on the saddle,\" he said.    Werther looked at him anxiously; then his eyes brightened with a  solution. He stepped closer and laid a hand on the other's arm.    \"Son, if you're broke and want to get the price of a few squares just  say the word and I'll fix you. I been busted myself in my own day, but  don't try your hand with my hoss. He ain't just a buckin' hoss; he's a  man-killer, lad. I'm tellin' you straight. And this floor ain't so soft  as the sawdust makes it look,\" he ended with a grin.    The younger man considered the animal seriously.    \"I'm not broke; I've simply taken a fancy to your horse. If you don't  mind, I'd like to try him out. Seems too bad, in a way, for a brute like  that to put it over on ten thousand people without getting a run for his  money--a sporting chance, eh?\"    And he laughed with great good nature.    \"What's your name?\" asked Werther, his small eyes growing round and  wide.    \"Anthony Woodbury.\"    \"Mine's Werther.\"    They shook hands.    \"City raised?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Didn't know they came in this style east of the Rockies, Woodbury. I  hope I lose my thousand, but if there was any betting I'd stake ten to  one against you.\"    In the meantime, some of the range-riders had thrown a coat over the  head of the stallion, and while he stood quivering with helpless rage  they flung a saddle on and drew the cinches taut.    Anthony Woodbury was saying with a smile: \"Just for the sake of the  game, I'll take you on for a few hundred, Mr. Werther, if you wish, but  I can't accept odds.\"    Werther ran a finger under his collar apparently to facilitate  breathing. His eyes, roving wildly, wandered over the white, silent mass  of faces, and his glance picked out and lingered for a moment on the  big-shouldered figure of Drew, erect in his box. At last his glance came  back with an intent frown to Woodbury. Something in the keen eyes of the  lad raised a responsive flicker in his own.    \"Well, I'll be damned! Just a game, eh? Lad, no matter on what side of  the Rockies you were born, I know your breed and I won't lay a penny  against your money. There's the hoss saddled and there's the floor  you'll land on. Go to it--and God help you!\"    The other shook his shoulders back and stepped toward the horse with a  peculiarly unpleasant smile, like a pugilist coming out of his corner  toward an opponent of unknown prowess.    He said: \"Take off the halter.\"    One of the men snapped viciously over his shoulder: \"Climb on while the  climbing's good. Cut out the bluff, partner.\"    The smile went out on the lips of Woodbury. He repeated: \"Take off the  halter.\"    They stared at him, but quickly began to fumble under the coat,  unfastening the buckle. It required a moment to work off the heavy  halter without giving the blinded animal a glimpse of the light; then  Woodbury caught the bridle reins firmly just beneath the chin of the  horse. With the other hand he took the stirrup strap and raised his  foot, but he seemed to change his mind about this matter.    \"Take off the blinder,\" he ordered.    It was Werther who interposed this time with: \"Look here, lad, I know  this hoss. The minute the blinder's off he'll up on his hind legs and  bash you into the floor with his forefeet.\"    \"Let him go,\" growled one of the cowboys. \"He's goin' to hell making a  gallery play.\"    But taking the matter into his own hands Woodbury snatched the coat from  the head of the stallion, which snorted and reared up, mouth agape ears  flattened back. There was a shout from the man, not a cry of dismay, but  a ringing battle yell like some ancient berserker seeing the first flash  of swords in the melee. He leaped forward, jerking down on the bridle  reins with all the force of his weight and his spring. The horse, caught  in mid-air, as it were, came floundering down on all fours again. Before  he could make another move, Woodbury caught the high horn of the saddle  and vaulted up to his seat. It was gallantly done and in response came a  great rustling from the multitude; there was not a spoken word, but  every man was on his feet.    Perhaps what followed took their breaths and kept them speechless. The  first touch of his rider's weight sent the stallion mad, not blind with  fear as most horses go, but raging with a devilish cunning like that of  an insane man, a thing that made the blood run cold to watch. He stood a  moment shuddering, as if the strange truth were slowly dawning on his  brute mind; then he bolted straight for the barriers. Woodbury braced  himself and lunged back on the reins, but he might as well have tugged  at the mooring cable of a great ship; the bit was in the monster's  teeth.    Then a whisper reached the rider, a universal hushing of drawn breath,  for the thousands were tasting the first thrill and terror of the  combat. They saw a picture of horse and man crushed against the barrier.  But there was no such stupid rage in the mind of the stallion.    At the last moment he swerved and raced close beside the fence; some  projecting edge caught the trousers of Woodbury and ripped away the  stout cloth from hip to heel. He swung far to the other side and  wrenched back the reins. With stiff-braced legs the stallion slid to a  halt that flung his unbalanced rider forward along his neck. Before he  could straighten himself in the saddle, the horse roared and came down  on rigid forelegs, yet by a miracle Woodbury clung, sprawled down the  side of the monster, to be sure, but was not quite dismounted.    Another pitch of the same nature would have freed the stallion from his  rider beyond doubt, but he elected to gallop full speed ahead the length  of the arena, and during that time, Woodbury, stunned though he was,  managed to drag himself back into the saddle. The end of the race was a  leap into the air that would have cleared a five-bar fence, and down  pitched the fighting horse on braced legs again. Woodbury's chin snapped  down against his breast as though he had been struck behind the head  with a heavy bar, but though his brain was stunned, the fighting  instinct remained strong in him and when the stallion reared and toppled  back the rider slipped from the saddle in the nick of time.    Fourteen hundred pounds of raging horseflesh crashed into the sawdust;  he rolled like a cat to his feet, but at the same instant a flying  weight leaped through the air and landed in the saddle. The audience  awoke to sound--to a dull roar of noise; a thin trickle of blood ran  from Woodbury's mouth and it seemed that the mob knew it and was yelling  for a death.    There followed a bewildering exhibition of such bucking that the  disgruntled cowboys forgot their shame and shouted with joy. Upon his  hind legs and then down on his forefeet with a sickening heartbreaking  jar the stallion rocked; now he bucked from side to side; now rose and  whirled about like a dancer; now toppled to the ground and twisted again  to his feet.    Still the rider clung. His head rocked with the ceaseless jars; the  red-stained lips writhed back and showed the locked teeth. Yet, as if he  scorned the struggles of the stallion, he brought into play the heavy  quirt which had been handed him as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11102"],[0,"History of Negro Soldiers in the Spanish-American War, and Other Items of (#2)"],[1,"of the United  States.\"    \"_Resolved further_, that the friendly offices of the United States  should be offered by the President to the Spanish government for the  recognition of the independence of Cuba.\"    THE INSURGENTS gained by this resolution an important point. It  dignified their so-called insurrection into an organized army, with a  government at its back which was so recognized and treated with. They  could buy and sell in American ports.    [Illustration: GENERAL ANTONIO MACEO.]    GENERAL ANTONIO MACEO about this time was doing great havoc along the  Spanish lines. He darted from place to place, back and forth across  the supposed impassable line of Spanish fortifications stretching  north and south across the island some distance from Havana, and known  as the _trocha_. Thousands of Spaniards fell as the result of his  daring and finesse in military execution. His deeds became known in  America, and though a man of Negro descent, with dark skin and crisp  hair, his fame was heralded far and wide in the American newspapers.  At a public gathering in New York, where his picture was exhibited,  the audience went wild with applause--the waving of handkerchiefs and  the wild hurrahs were long and continued. The career of this hero was  suddenly terminated by death, due to the treachery of his physician  Zertucha, who, under the guise of a proposed treaty of peace, induced  him to meet a company of Spanish officers, at which meeting, according  to a pre-arranged plot, a mob of Spanish infantry rushed in on General  Maceo and shot him down unarmed. It is said that his friends recovered  his body and buried it in a secret place unknown to the Spaniards, who  were anxious to obtain it for exhibition as a trophy of war in Havana.  Maceo was equal to Toussaint L'Overture of San Domingo. His public  life was consecrated to liberty; he knew no vice nor mean action; he  would not permit any around him. When he landed in Cuba from Porto  Rico he was told there were no arms. He replied, \"I will get them with  my machete,\" and he left five thousand to the Cubans, conquered by his  arm. Every time the Spanish attacked him they were beaten and left  thousands of arms and much ammunition in his possession. He was born  in Santiago de Cuba July 14, 1848.    THE SPIRIT OF THE INSURGENTS did not break with General Maceo's death.  Others rose up to fill his place, the women even taking arms in the  defence of home and liberty. \"At first no one believed, who had not  seen them, that there were women in the Cuban army; but there is no  doubt about it. They are not all miscalled amazons, for they are  warlike women and do not shun fighting. The difficulty in employing  them being that they are insanely brave. When they ride into battle  they become exalted and are dangerous creatures. Those who first  joined the forces on the field were the wives of men belonging in the  army, and their purpose was rather to be protected than to become  heroines and avengers. It shows the state of the island, that the  women found the army the safest place for them. With the men saved  from the plantations and the murderous bandits infesting the roads and  committing every lamentable outrage upon the helpless, some of the  high spirited Cuban women followed their husbands, and the example has  been followed, and some, instead of consenting to be protected, have  taken up the fashion of fighting.\"--_Murat Halsted_.    JOSE MACEO, brother of Antonio, was also a troublesome character to  the Spaniards, who were constantly being set upon by him and his men.    WEYLER'S POLICY AND THE BRAVE STRUGGLE of the people both appealed  very strongly for American sympathy with the Insurgent cause. The  American people were indignant at Weyler and were inspired by the  conduct of the Insurgents. Public sentiment grew stronger with every  fresh report of an Insurgent victory, or a Weyler persecution.    MISS EVANGELINA COSIO Y CISNERO'S RESCUE helped to arouse sentiment.  This young and beautiful girl of aristocratic Cuban parentage alleged  that a Spanish officer had, on the occasion of a _raid_ made on her  home, in which her father was captured and imprisoned as a Cuban  sympathizer, proposed her release on certain illicit conditions,  and on her refusal she was incarcerated with her aged father in the  renowned but filthy and dreaded Morro Castle at Havana.    [Illustration: MISS EVANGELINA COSIO Y CISNEROS.]    _Appeal after appeal_ by large numbers of the most prominent women in  America was made to General Weyler, and even to the Queen Regent of  Spain, for her release, but without avail, when finally the news was  flashed to America that she had escaped. This proved to be true--her  release being effected by Carl Decker, a reporter on the New York  Journal--a most daring fete. Miss Cisneros was brought to America and  became the greatest sensation of the day. Her beauty, her affection  for her aged father, her innocence, and the thrilling events of her  rescue, made her the public idol, and gave _Cuba libre_ a new impetus  in American sympathy.    SPAIN AND HAVANA felt the touch of these ever spreading waves  of public sentiment, and began to resent them. At Havana public  demonstrations were made against America. The life of Consul General  Lee was threatened. The Spanish Minister at Washington, Senor de Lome,  was exposed for having written to a friend a most insulting letter,  describing President McKinley as a low politician and a weakling.  For this he was recalled by Spain at the request of the American  government.    Protection to American citizens and property in Havana became  necessary, and accordingly the BATTLE SHIP MAINE was sent there for  this purpose, the United States government disclaiming any other  motives save those of protection to Americans and their interests.  The Maine was, to all outward appearances, friendly received by the  Spaniards at Havana by the usual salutes and courtesies of the  navy, and was anchored at a point in the bay near a certain buoy  _designated_ by the Spanish Commander. This was on January 25, 1898,  and on February 15th this noble vessel was blown to pieces, and 266  of its crew perished--two colored men being in the number. This event  added fuel to the already burning fire of American feeling against  Spain. Public sentiment urged an immediate declaration of war.  President McKinley counseled moderation. Captain Siggsbee, who  survived the wreck of the Maine, published an open address in which  he advised that adverse criticism be delayed until an official  investigation could be made of the affair.    The official investigation was had by a Court of Inquiry, composed of  Captain W.T. Sampson of the Iowa, Captain F.C. Chadwick of the  New York, Lieutenant-Commander W.P. Potter of the New York, and  Lieutenant-Commander Adolph Marix of the Vermont, appointed by the  President. Divers were employed; many witnesses were examined, and the  court, by a unanimous decision, rendered March 21, 1898, after a four  weeks session, reported as follows: \"That the loss of the Maine was  not in any respect due to the fault or negligence on the part of any  of the officers or members of her crew; that the ship was destroyed by  the explosion of a submarine mine which caused the partial explosion  of two or more of her forward magazines; and that no evidence has been  obtainable fixing the responsibility for the destruction of the Maine  upon any person or persons.\"    Responsibility in this report is not fixed on any \"person or persons.\"  It reads something like the usual verdict of a coroner's jury after  investigating the death of some colored man who has been lynched,--\"he  came to his death by the hands of parties unknown.\" This report on  the Maine's destruction, _unlike_ the usual coroner's jury verdict,  however, in one respect, was not accepted by the people who claimed  that Spain was responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the  explosion, and the public still clamored for war to avenge the  outrage.    [Illustration: U.S.S. MAINE]    CONGRESS ALSO CATCHES the war fever and appropriated $50,000,000 \"for  the national defence\" by a unanimous vote of both houses. The war and  navy departments became very active; agents were sent abroad to buy  war ships, but the President still hesitated to state his position  until he had succeeded in getting the American Consuls out of Cuba who  were in danger from the Spaniards there. Consul Hyatt embarked from  Santiago April 3, and Consul General Lee, who was delayed in getting  off American refugees, left on April 10, and on that day the PRESIDENT  SENT HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. He pictured the deplorable condition of  the people of Cuba, due to General Weyler's policy; he recommended  that the Insurgent government be not recognized, as such recognition  might involve this government in \"embarrassing international  complications,\" but referred the whole subject to Congress for action.    CONGRESS DECLARES WAR ON APRIL 13 by a joint resolution of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of both houses, which was adopted, after a  conference of the two committees, April 18, in the following form:    Whereas, the abhorrent conditions which have existed for more than  three years in the island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have  shocked the moral sense of the people of the United States, have been  a disgrace to Christian civilization, culminating as they have in the  destruction of a United States battle ship, with 266 of its officers  and crew, while on a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana, and  cannot longer be endured, as has been set forth by the President of  the United States in his message to Congress of April 11, 1898, upon  which the action of Congress was invited: therefore,    _Resolved_, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled--    First, that the people of the island of Cuba are,"]]]
