When killed and cut up, begin immediately to salt them. Rub the  outside of each ham with a tea-spoonful of powdered saltpetre, and  the inside with a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper. Having mixed  together brown sugar and fine salt, in the proportion of a pound  and a half of brown sugar to a quart of salt, rub the pork well  with it. This quantity of sugar and salt will be sufficient for  fifty pounds of meat. Have ready some large tubs, the bottoms  sprinkled with salt, and lay the meat in the tubs with the skin  downward. Put plenty of salt between each layer of meat. After it  has lain eight days, take it out and wipe off all the salt, and  wash the tubs. Make a pickle of soft water, equal quantities of  salt and molasses, and a little saltpetre; allowing four ounces of  saltpetre to two quarts of molasses and two quarts of salt, which  is the proportion for fifty pounds of meat. The pickle must be  strong enough to bear up an egg. Boil and skim it; and when it is  cold, pour it over the meat, which must be turned every day and  basted with the pickle. The hams should remain in the pickle at  least four weeks; the shoulders and middlings of the bacon three  weeks; and the jowls two weeks. They should then be taken out and  smoked. Having washed off the pickle, before you smoke the meat,  bury it, while wet, in a tub of bran. This will form a crust over  it, and prevent evaporation of the juices. Let the smoke-house be  ready to receive the meat immediately. Take it out of the tub  after it has lain half an hour, and rub the bran evenly over it.  Then hang it up to smoke with the small end downwards. The smoke-house  should be dark and cool, and should stand alone, for the  heat occasioned by an adjoining--building may spoil the meat, or  produce insects. Keep up a good smoke all day, but have no blaze.  Hickory is the best wood for a smoke-house fire, In three or four  weeks the meat will be sufficiently smoked, and fit for use.  During the process it should be occasionally taken down, examined,  and hung up again. The best way of keeping hams is to wrap them in  paper, or, to sew them in coarse cloths (which should be white-washed)  and bury them in a barrel of hickory ashes. The ashes must  be frequently changed.    An old ham will require longer to soak, and longer to boil than a  new one.    Tongues may be cured in the above manner.      LIVER PUDDINGS.    Boil some pigs' livers. When cold, mince them, and season them  with pepper, salt, and some sage and sweet marjoram rubbed fine.  You may add some powdered cloves. Have ready some large skins  nicely cleaned, and fill them with the mixture, tying up the ends  securely. Prick them with a fork to prevent their bursting; put  them into hot water, and boil them slowly for about an hour. They  will require no farther cooking before you eat them. Keep them in  stone jars closely covered. They are eaten cold at breakfast or  supper, cut into slices an inch thick or more; or they may be cut  into large pieces, and broiled or fried.      COMMON SAUSAGE-MEAT.    Having cleared it from the skin, sinews, and gristle, take six  pounds of the lean of young fresh pork, and three pounds of the  fat, and mince it all as fine as possible. Take some dried sage,  pick off the leaves and rub them to powder, allowing three tea-spoonfuls  to each pound of meat. Having mixed the fat and lean  well together, and seasoned it with nine tea-spoonfuls of pepper,  and the same quantity of salt, strew on the powdered sage, and mix  the whole very well with your hands. Put it away in a stone jar,  packing it down hard; and keep it closely covered. Set the jar in  a cool dry place.    When you wish to use the sausage-meat, make it into flat cakes  about an inch thick and the size of a dollar; dredge them with  flour, and fry them in butter or dripping, over rather a slow  fire, till they are well browned on both sides, and thoroughly  done.    Sausages are seldom eaten except at breakfast.      FINE SAUSAGES.    Take some fresh pork, (the leg is best,) and clear it from the  skin, sinews, and gristle. Allow two pounds of fat to three pounds  of lean. Mince it all very fine, and season it with two ounces and  a half of salt, half an ounce of pepper, thirty cloves, and a  dozen blades of mace powdered, three grated, nutmegs, six table-spoonfuls  of powdered sage, and two tea-spoonfuls of powdered  rosemary. Mix all well together. Put it into a stone jar, and  press it down very hard. Cover it closely, and keep it in a dry  cool place.    When you use this sausage-meat, mix with it some beaten yolk of  egg, and make it into balls or cakes. Dredge them with flour, and  fry them in butter.      BOLOGNA SAUSAGES.    Take ten pounds of beef, and four pounds of pork; two-thirds of  the meat should be lean, and only one third fat. Chop it very  fine, and mix it well together. Then season it with six ounces of  fine salt, one ounce of black pepper, half an ounce of cayenne,  one table-spoonful of powdered cloves; and one clove or garlic  minced very fine.    Have ready some large skins nicely cleaned and prepared, (they  should be beef-skins,) and wash them in salt and vinegar. Fill  them with the above mixture, and secure the ends by tying them  with packthread or fine twine. Make a brine of salt and water  strong enough to bear up an egg. Put the sausages into it, and'  let them lie for three weeks, turning them daily. Then take them  out, wipe them dry, hang them up and smoke them. Before you put  them away rub them all over with, sweet oil,    Keep them in ashes. That of vine-twigs is best for them.    You may fry them or not before you eat them.      PORK CHEESE.    Take the heads, tongues, and feet of young fresh pork, or any  other pieces that are convenient. Having removed the skin, boil  them till all the meat is quite tender, and can be easily stripped  from the bones. Then chop it small, and season it with salt and  black pepper to your taste, and if you choose, some beaten cloves.  Add sage-leaves and sweet marjoram, minced fine, or rubbed to  powder. Mix the whole very well together with your hands. Put it  into deep pans, with straight sides, (the shape of a cheese,)  press it down hard and closely with a plate that will fit the pan;  putting the under side of the plate next to the meat, and placing  a heavy weight on it. In two or three days it will be fit for use,  and you may turn it out of the pan. Send it to table cut in  slices, and use mustard and vinegar with it. It is generally eaten  at supper or breakfast.      PIG'S FEET AND EARS SOUSED.    Having cleaned them properly, and removed the skin, boil them  slowly till they are quite tender, and then split the feet and put  them with the ears into salt and vinegar, flavoured with a little  mace. Cover the jar closely, and set it away. When you use them,  dry each piece well with a cloth; dip them first in beaten yolk of  egg, and then in bread-crumbs, and fry them nicely in butter or  lard. Or you may eat them cold, just out of the vinegar.    If you intend keeping them some time, you must make a fresh pickle  for them every other day.      TO IMITATE WESTPHALIA HAM.    The very finest pork must be used for these hams. Mix together an  equal quantity of powdered saltpetre and brown sugar, and rub it  well into the hams. Next day make a pickle in sufficient quantity  to cover them very well. The proportions of the ingredients are a  pound and a half of fine salt, half a pound of brown sugar, an  ounce of black pepper and an ounce of cloves pounded to powder, a  small bit of sal prunella, and a quart of stale strong beer or  porter. Boil them all together, so as to make a pickle that will  bear up an egg. Pour it boiling hot over the meat, and let it lie  in the pickle two weeks, turning it two or three times every day,  and basting or washing it with the liquid. Then take out the hams,  rub them with bran and smoke them for a fortnight. When done, keep  them in a barrel of wood ashes.    In cooking these hams simmer them slowly for seven or eight hours.    To imitate the shape of the real Westphalia hams, cut some of the  meat off the under side of the thick part, so as to give them a  flat appearance. Do this before you begin to cure them, first  loosening the skin and afterwards sewing it on again.    The ashes in which you keep them must be changed frequently,  wiping the hams when you take them out.      TO GLAZE A COLD HAM.    With a brush or quill feather go all over the ham with beaten yolk  of egg. Then cover it thickly with pounded cracker, made as fine  as flour, or with grated crumbs of stale bread. Lastly go over it  with thick cream. Put it to brown in the oven of a stove, or brown  it on the spit of a tin roaster, set before the fire and turned  frequently.    This glazing will be found delicious.          VENISON, &c.      TO ROAST A SADDLE OR HAUNCH OF VENISON.    Wipe it all over with a sponge dipped in warm water Then rub the  skin with lard or nice dripping. Cover the fat with sheets of  paper two double, buttered, and tied on with packthread that has  been soaked to keep it from burning. Or, what is still better, you  may cover the first sheets of paper with a coarse paste of flour  and water rolled out half an inch thick, and then cover the paste  with the second sheets of paper, securing the whole well with the  string to prevent its falling off. Place the venison on the spit  before a strong clear fire, such as you would have for a sirloin  of beef, and let the fire be well kept up all the time. Put some  claret and butter into the dripping-pan and baste the meat with it  frequently. If wrapped in paste, it will not be done in less than  five hours. Half an hour before you take it up, remove the  coverings carefully, place the meat nearer to the fire, baste it  with fresh butter and dredge it very lightly with flour.

We shall further  show you that this was the posture of things up to the 15th day of May in  this present year. Upon that day the prisoner comes riding through the  village, as of custom, and met with the young woman: but in place of  passing her by, as he had lately done, he stopped, and said some words to  her with which she appeared wonderfully pleased, and so left her; and  after that day she was nowhere to be found, notwithstanding a strict  search was made for her. The next time of the prisoner's passing through  the place, her relations inquired of him whether he should know anything  of her whereabouts; which he totally denied. They expressed to him their  fears lest her weak intellects should have been upset by the attention he  had showed her, and so she might have committed some rash act against her  own life, calling him to witness the same time how often they had  beseeched him to desist from taking notice of her, as fearing trouble  might come of it: but this, too, he easily laughed away. But in spite of  this light behaviour, it was noticeable in him that about this time his  carriage and demeanour changed, and it was said of him that he seemed a  troubled man. And here I come to a passage to which I should not dare to  ask your attention, but that it appears to me to be founded in truth, and  is supported by testimony deserving of credit. And, gentlemen, to my  judgement it doth afford a great instance of God's revenge against  murder, and that He will require the blood of the innocent.    [Here Mr Attorney made a pause, and shifted with his papers: and it was  thought remarkable by me and others, because he was a man not easily  dashed.]    _L.C.J._ Well, Mr Attorney, what is your instance?    _Att._ My lord, it is a strange one, and the truth is that, of all the  cases I have been concerned in, I cannot call to mind the like of it. But  to be short, gentlemen, we shall bring you testimony that Ann Clark was  seen after this 15th of May, and that, at such time as she was so seen,  it was impossible she could have been a living person.    [Here the people made a hum, and a good deal of laughter, and the Court  called for silence, and when it was made]--    _L.C.J._ Why, Mr Attorney, you might save up this tale for a week; it  will be Christmas by that time, and you can frighten your cook-maids with  it [at which the people laughed again, and the prisoner also, as it  seemed]. God, man, what are you prating of--ghosts and Christmas jigs and  tavern company--and here is a man's life at stake! [To the prisoner]: And  you, sir, I would have you know there is not so much occasion for you to  make merry neither. You were not brought here for that, and if I know Mr  Attorney, he has more in his brief than he has shown yet. Go on, Mr  Attorney. I need not, mayhap, have spoken so sharply, but you must  confess your course is something unusual.    _Att._ Nobody knows it better than I, my lord: but I shall bring it to an  end with a round turn. I shall show you, gentlemen, that Ann Clark's body  was found in the month of June, in a pond of water, with the throat cut:  that a knife belonging to the prisoner was found in the same water: that  he made efforts to recover the said knife from the water: that the  coroner's quest brought in a verdict against the prisoner at the bar, and  that therefore he should by course have been tried at Exeter: but that,  suit being made on his behalf, on account that an impartial jury could  not be found to try him in his own country, he hath had that singular  favour shown him that he should be tried here in London. And so we will  proceed to call our evidence.    Then the facts of the acquaintance between the prisoner and Ann Clark  were proved, and also the coroner's inquest. I pass over this portion of  the trial, for it offers nothing of special interest.    Sarah Arscott was next called and sworn.    _Att._ What is your occupation?    _S._ I keep the New Inn at--.    _Att._ Do you know the prisoner at the bar?    _S._ Yes: he was often at our house since he come first at Christmas of  last year.    _Att._ Did you know Ann Clark?    _S._ Yes, very well.    _Att._ Pray, what manner of person was she in her appearance?    _S._ She was a very short thick-made woman: I do not know what else you  would have me say.    _Att._ Was she comely?    _S._ No, not by no manner of means: she was very uncomely, poor child!  She had a great face and hanging chops and a very bad colour like a  puddock.    _L.C.J._ What is that, mistress? What say you she was like?    _S._ My lord, I ask pardon; I heard Esquire Martin say she looked like a  puddock in the face; and so she did.    _L.C.J._ Did you that? Can you interpret her, Mr Attorney?    _Att._ My lord, I apprehend it is the country word for a toad.    _L.C.J._ Oh, a hop-toad! Ay, go on.    _Att._ Will you give an account to the jury of what passed between you  and the prisoner at the bar in May last?    _S._ Sir, it was this. It was about nine o'clock the evening after that  Ann did not come home, and I was about my work in the house; there was no  company there only Thomas Snell, and it was foul weather. Esquire Martin  came in and called for some drink, and I, by way of pleasantry, I said to  him, \"Squire, have you been looking after your sweetheart?\" and he flew  out at me in a passion and desired I would not use such expressions. I  was amazed at that, because we were accustomed to joke with him about  her.    _L.C.J._ Who, her?    _S._ Ann Clark, my lord. And we had not heard the news of his being  contracted to a young gentlewoman elsewhere, or I am sure I should have  used better manners. So I said nothing, but being I was a little put out,  I begun singing, to myself as it were, the song they danced to the first  time they met, for I thought it would prick him. It was the same that he  was used to sing when he came down the street; I have heard it very  often: '_Madam, will you walk, will you talk with me?_' And it fell out  that I needed something that was in the kitchen. So I went out to get it,  and all the time I went on singing, something louder and more bold-like.  And as I was there all of a sudden I thought I heard someone answering  outside the house, but I could not be sure because of the wind blowing so  high. So then I stopped singing, and now I heard it plain, saying, '_Yes,  sir, I will walk, I will talk with you_,' and I knew the voice for Ann  Clark's voice.    _Att._ How did you know it to be her voice?    _S._ It was impossible I could be mistaken. She had a dreadful voice, a  kind of a squalling voice, in particular if she tried to sing. And there  was nobody in the village that could counterfeit it, for they often  tried. So, hearing that, I was glad, because we were all in an anxiety to  know what was gone with her: for though she was a natural, she had a good  disposition and was very tractable: and says I to myself, 'What, child!  are you returned, then?' and I ran into the front room, and said to  Squire Martin as I passed by, 'Squire, here is your sweetheart back  again: shall I call her in?' and with that I went to open the door; but  Squire Martin he caught hold of me, and it seemed to me he was out of his  wits, or near upon. 'Hold, woman,' says he, 'in God's name!' and I know  not what else: he was all of a shake. Then I was angry, and said I,  'What! are you not glad that poor child is found?' and I called to Thomas  Snell and said, 'If the Squire will not let me, do you open the door and  call her in.' So Thomas Snell went and opened the door, and the wind  setting that way blew in and overset the two candles that was all we had  lighted: and Esquire Martin fell away from holding me; I think he fell  down on the floor, but we were wholly in the dark, and it was a minute or  two before I got a light again: and while I was feeling for the fire-box,  I am not certain but I heard someone step 'cross the floor, and I am sure  I heard the door of the great cupboard that stands in the room open and  shut to. Then, when I had a light again, I see Esquire Martin on the  settle, all white and sweaty as if he had swounded away, and his arms  hanging down; and I was going to help him; but just then it caught my eye  that there was something like a bit of a dress shut into the cupboard  door, and it came to my mind I had heard that door shut. So I thought it  might be some person had run in when the light was quenched, and was  hiding in the cupboard. So I went up closer and looked: and there was a  bit of a black stuff cloak, and just below it an edge of a brown stuff  dress, both sticking out of the shut of the door: and both of them was  low down, as if the person that had them on might be crouched down  inside.    _Att._ What did you take it to be?    _S._ I took it to be a woman's dress.    _Att._ Could you make any guess whom it belonged to? Did you know anyone  who wore such a dress?    _S._ It was a common stuff, by what I could see. I have seen many women  wearing such a stuff in our parish.    _Att._ Was it like Ann Clark's dress?    _S._ She used to wear just such a dress: but I could not say on my oath  it was hers.    _Att._ Did you observe anything else about it?    _S_. I did notice that it looked very wet: but it was foul weather  outside.    _L.C.J._ Did you feel of it, mistress?    _S._ No, my lord, I did not like to touch it.    _L.C.J._ Not like? Why that? Are you so nice that you scruple to feel of  a wet dress?    _S._ Indeed, my lord, I cannot very well tell why: only it had a nasty  ugly look about it.    _L.C.J._ Well, go on.    _S_. Then I called again to Thomas Snell, and bid him come to me and  catch anyone that come out when I should open the cupboard door, 'for,'  says I, 'there is someone hiding within, and I would know what she  wants.' And with that Squire Martin gave a sort of a cry or a shout and  ran out of the house into"]]]
