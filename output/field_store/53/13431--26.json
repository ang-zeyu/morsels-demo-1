Every son of Erin is an actor, and now Harrigan's  laughter rang true.    \"What should I mean except what I said?\" he answered.    \"He's tryin' to save his head,\" broke in Kyle, \"but with the fear of  death lookin' him in the eye, any man would join us. Finish him, lads.\"    \"You fool!\" said Harrigan authoritatively. \"Don't talk so loud, or  you'll have White Henshaw down on our heads. Maybe he's heard that bull  voice of yours already!\"    It was a master stroke. The mention of the terrible skipper and the  skillful insinuation that he was one of them, made them straighten and  stare at him.    \"Go guard the door,\" said Hovey to one of his sailors, \"an' see that  none of the mates is near. Now, Harrigan, what d'you mean? You'd hear  no word of mutiny when I talked to you. Speak for your life now,  because we're hard to convince.\"    \"We can't be convinced,\" said Garry Cochrane, \"but maybe it'll be fun  to hear him talk before we dump him overboard.\"    Instead of answering the speaker, Harrigan looked upon Hovey with a  cold eye of scorn.    He said: \"I changed my mind. I'm _not_ one of you. I thought the bos'n  was a real captain for the gang, but I'll not follow a dog that lets  every one of his pack yelp.\"    \"I'm a dog, am I?\" snarled Hovey furiously. \"I'll teach you what I am,  Harrigan. An' you, Cochrane, keep your face shut. I'll learn you who's  boss of this little crew!\"    \"If you're half the man you seem,\" went on Harrigan, \"this game looks  good to me.\"    \"You lie,\" said the bos'n. \"You turned me down cold when I talked to  you.\"    \"You fool, that was because you said no word outright of wipin' out the  officers an' takin' control of the ship. You sneaked up to me in the  dark; you felt me out before you said a word; you were like a cat  watchin' a rathole. Am I a rat? Am I a sneak? Do I have to be whispered  to? No, I'm Harrigan, an' anyone who wants to talk to me has got to  speak out like a man!\"    The very impudence of his speech held them in check for another  precious moment. He whirled the heavy stool.    \"If you wanted me, why didn't you come an' say: 'Harrigan, I know you.  You hate Henshaw an' McTee an' the rest. We're goin' to wipe 'em out  an' beach the ship. Are you with us?' Why, then I'd of shook hands with  you, and that would end it. But when you come whisperin' and  insinuatin', sayin' nothin' straight from the shoulder, how'd I know  you weren't sent by Henshaw to feel me out, eh? How do any of you know  the bos'n ain't feelin' you out for the skipper he's sailed with ten  years?\"    The circle shifted, loosened; half the men were facing Hovey with  suspicious eyes. They had not thought of this greater danger, and the  bos'n was desperate in the crisis.    \"Boys,\" he pleaded, \"are you goin' to let one stranger ball up our  game? Are you goin' to start doubtin' me on his say-so?\"    The men glanced from him to Harrigan. Plainly they were deep in doubt,  and the Irishman made his second masterful move. He stepped forward,  dropping his stool with a crash to the floor, and clapped a hand upon  Hovey's shoulder.    \"I spoke too quick,\" he said frankly, \"but you got me mad, bos'n. I  know you're straight, an' I'm with you, for one. A man Harrigan will  toiler ought to be good enough for the rest, eh?\"    Jerry Hovey wiped his gleaming forehead. The kingdom of his ambition  was rebuilt by this speech.    \"Sit down, boys,\" he ordered. \"The last man in the forecastle is with  us now. We're solid. Sit down and we'll plan our game.\"    The plan, as it developed after the circle re-formed, was a simple one.  They were to wait until the ship was within two or three days' voyage  from the coast of Central America--their destination--and then they  would act. They had secured to their side the firemen and the first  assistant engineer. That meant that they could run the ship safely with  the bos'n, who understood navigation, at the wheel. They would select a  night, and then, on the command of Hovey, the men would take the arms  which they had prepared.    One of the Japanese cabin boys, Kamasura, was a member of the plot. He  would furnish butcherknives and cleavers from the kitchen. Besides  this, there were various implements which could be used as bludgeons;  and finally there were the pocketknives with which every sailor is  always equipped, generally stout, long-bladed instruments. The  advantage of firearms was with the officers of the ship, but apparently  there were no rifles and probably very few revolvers aboard. Against  powder and lead they would have the advantage of a surprise attack.    First, Sam Hall and Kyle were to go down to the hole of the ship and  lead the firemen in their attack upon the oilers and wipers, most of  whom had not been approachable with the plan of mutiny because they  were newly signed on the ship. In this part of the campaign the most  important feature would be the capturing of Campbell, who would be  reserved for a finely drawn-out, tortured death. The firemen had  insisted upon this.    In the meantime Hovey with Flint and the rest would attack the cabins  of Henshaw, McTee, and the mates. Here they depended chiefly upon the  effect of the surprise. If it were possible, Henshaw also was to be  taken alive and reserved for a long death like Campbell. This done,  they would lead the ship to an uninhabited part of the shore, beach  her, and scatter over the mainland, each with his share of the booty.    Harrigan forced himself to take an active part in the discussion of the  plans. Several features were his own suggestion, among others the idea  of presenting a petition for better food to Henshaw, and beating him  down while he was reading it; but all the time that the Irishman spoke,  he was thinking of Kate.    When the crew turned into their bunks at last, he went over a thousand  schemes in his head. In the first place he might go to Henshaw at once  and warn him of the coming danger, but he remembered what the bos'n had  said--in such a case he would not be believed, and both the crew and  the commander would be against him.    Finally it seemed to him that the best thing was to wait until the  critical moment had arrived. He could warn the captain just in time--or  if absolutely necessary he could warn McTee, who would certainly  believe him. In the meantime there were possibilities that the mutiny  would come to nothing through internal dissension among the crew. In  any case he must play a detestable part, acting as a spy upon the crew  and pretending enthusiasm for the mutiny.    With that shame like a taste of soot in his throat, he climbed to the  bridge the next morning with his bucket of suds and his brush, and  there as usual he found McTee, cool and clean in the white outfit of  Henshaw. At sight of the Scotchman he remembered at once that he must  pretend the double exhaustion which comes of pain and hard labor.  Therefore he thrust out his lower jaw and favored McTee with a glare of  hate. He was repaid by the glow of content which showed in the  captain's face.    \"And the hole of the _Heron_,\" he said, speaking softly lest his voice  should carry to the man in the wheelhouse, \"is it cooler than the  fireroom of the _Mary Rogers?_\"    Harrigan glanced up, glowering.    \"Damn you, McTee!\"    \"The palms of your hands, lad, are they raw? Is the lye of the suds  cool to them?\"    Another black glance came in reply and McTee leaned back against the  rail, tapping one contented toe against the floor.    \"It was a fine tale you told me yesterday, Harrigan,\" he said at  length, \"but afterward I saw Kate, and she was never kinder. I spoke of  you, and we laughed together about it. She said you were like a horse  that's too proud--you need the whip!\"    Harrigan was in doubt, but he concealed his trouble with a mighty  effort and smiled.    \"That's a weak lie, Angus. When I was a boy of ten, I would of hung me  head for shame if I could not have made a better lie. Shall I tell you  what really happened when you met Kate? You came up smilin' an'  grinnin' like a baboon, an' she passed you by with a look that went  through you as if you were just a cloud on the edge of the sky. Am I  right, McTee?\"    \"You've seen her, and she's told you this,\" exclaimed the captain.    Harrigan chuckled his triumph and went on with the scrubbing of the  bridge.    \"No, Angus, me dear, I've not seen her, but when two souls are as close  as hers and mine--well, cap'n, I leave it to you!\"    McTee ground his teeth with rage and turned his back on the worker for  a moment until he could master the contorted muscles of his face.    \"Tut, McTee,\" went on the Irishman, \"you've but felt the tickle of the  spur; when I drive it in, you'll yell like a whipped kid. Always you  play into me hands, McTee. Now when you see Kate, you'll feel me grin  in the background mockin' ye, eh?\"    The banter gave the captain a shrewd inspiration. He leaned, and  catching one of Harrigan's hands with a quick movement, turned it palm  up. It was as he suspected; the palm, though red from the effect of the  strong suds and still scarcely healed after the torment of the _Mary  Rogers_, was nevertheless manifestly unharmed by the labor which it was  supposed Harrigan had performed the day before. The hand was wrenched  away and a balled fist held under McTee's nose.    \"If you're curious, Angus, look at me knuckles, not me palm. It's the  knuckles you'll feel the most, cap'n.\"          CHAPTER 22      But McTee, deep in thought, was walking from the bridge. He went  straight to the hole of the ship and questioned some of the firemen,  and they told him that Harrigan had done no work passing coal the day  before; Campbell, it appeared, had taken him for some special job. With  this tidings the Scotchman hastened back to Henshaw.    \"The game's slipping through our hands, captain,\" he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#19)"],[1,"been a sepulcher for the  corpses of thine own people, and thy holy house itself had been a burial  place in their civil strife.\"    [Footnote 1: Hist. v. 13. Gens superstitioni prona, religioni obnoxia.]    It is curious that a little later, when he resumes the narrative of the  Roman campaign, and returns presumably to a Roman source, he says that  the Jews, elated by their unexpected success, made incursions on the  Greek cities. The success referred to must be the defeat of Cestius  Gallus, and it looks as if this lurid account of the horrors of the  civil war in Jerusalem were not known to the Roman guide, and that at  the least Josephus has embroidered the story of the feud to suit his  thesis. The measure of the Jewish writer's dependence for the main part  of his narrative of the siege is singularly illustrated by a small  detail. Josephus throughout his account uses the Macedonian names of the  months, and equates them loosely with those of the Jewish calendar; but  it is notable that the three traditional Jewish dates in the siege which  he inserts, the fourteenth of Xanthicus (Nisan), when it began, the  seventeenth of Panemos (Tammuz), when the daily offering ceased, and the  ninth and tenth of Loos (Ab), when the Temple was destroyed, conflict  with the other dates he gives in his general account of the siege. So  far from being a proof of his independence, as has been claimed, his  Jewish dates show his want of skill in weaving his Jewish information  into his scheme. When he is original, he is apt to be unhistorical.  Josephus agrees with the Talmud that the fire lasted to the tenth of the  month,[1] but while the Rabbis cursed Titus, who burnt the Holy of  Holies and spread fire and slaughter, and Roman historians[2] declared  that Titus had deliberately fired the center of the Jewish cult in order  to destroy the national stronghold, Josephus is anxious to preserve his  patron's reputation for gentleness and invest him with the appearance of  piety and magnanimity. Voicing perhaps the conqueror's later regrets, he  declares that he protested against the Romans' avenging themselves on  inanimate things and against the destruction of so beautiful a work, but  failed despite all his efforts to stay the conflagration. The historian  writes a lurid description of the catastrophe, but he omits the simple  details that make the account in the Talmud so pathetic. \"The Temple,\"  runs the Talmudic account[3] \"was destroyed on the eve of the ninth day  of Ab at the outgoing of Sabbath, at the end of the Sabbatic year; and  the watch of Jehoiarib was on service, and the Levites were chanting the  hymns and standing at their desks. And the hymn they chanted was, 'And  He shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off with  their own wickedness' (Ps. 94:23); and they could not finish to say,  'The Lord our God shall cut them off,' when the heathen came and  silenced them.\" This account may not be historically true, but it  represents the unquenchable spirit of Judaism in face of the disaster.    [Footnote 1: Comp. Yer. Taanit, iv. 6.]    [Footnote 2: Comp. Sulpicius Severus, who used Tacitus (Chron. I. xxx.  6.); and the poet Valerius Flaccus acclaims the victor of Solymae, who  hurls fiery torches at the Temple. Dion Cassius (lxvi. 4.) declares that  when the Roman soldiers refused to attack the Temple in awe of its  holiness, Titus himself set fire to it; and this appears to be the true  account.]    [Footnote 3: Taanit, 29a.]    Josephus, on the other hand, regards the fall of the Temple as a  favorable opportunity to give a list of the prodigies and omens that  heralded it. For example, he finds a proof of Providence in the  fulfilment of the oracle, that the city and the holy house should be  taken when the Temple should become foursquare. By demolishing the tower  of Antonia the Jews had made the Temple area foursquare, and so brought  the doom upon themselves. He tells, too, the story of a prophet Jesus,  who for years had cried, \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem,\" and in the end, struck  by a missile, fell, crying, \"Woe, woe to me!\" For any reflections,  however, on the immortality of the religion or for any utterances of  hope for the ultimate restoration of the Temple and the coming of the  Messiah, we must not look to the _Wars_. Such ideas would not have  pleased his patrons, had he entertained them himself. He pointed to the  fulfilment of prophecy only so far as it predicted and justified the  destruction and ruin of his people. The expression of the national agony  at the destruction of the national center is to be found in the  apocryphal book of Esdras II.    Over his account of the final acts of the tragedy we may pass quickly.  Undismayed by the fall of the sanctuary and still hoping for divine  intervention, John and Simon withdrew from the Temple to the upper city.  Driven from this, they took refuge in the underground caverns and caves  to be found everywhere beneath Jerusalem, and finally they stood their  ground in the towers, until these too were captured, a month after the  destruction of the Temple, on the eighth of Elul (Gorpiaeus, as the  Greek month was called).    \"It was the fifth time that the city was captured; and 2179 years passed  between its first building and its last destruction. Yet neither its  great antiquity, nor its vast riches, nor the diffusion of the nation  over the whole earth, nor the greatness of the veneration paid to it on  religious grounds, was sufficient to preserve it from destruction. And  thus ended the siege of Jerusalem.\"    Though the war was not finished, the crisis of the drama was over, and  Josephus, doubtless following his source, relaxes the narrative to  digress about affairs in Rome and the East. The last book of the _Wars_  is episodic and disconnected. It is a kind of aftermath, in which the  historian gathers up scattered records, but does not preserve the  dramatic character of the history. He had apparently here to fall back  on his own feeble constructive power, and was hard put to it to eke out  his material to the proportions of a book.    So careless, too, is he that he abstracts references from his source  that are meaningless. In the excursion into general history, he refers  to \"the German king Alaric, whom we have mentioned before,\"[1] though he  is brought in for the first time; and in the account of the siege of the  Zealots' fortress Machaerus he records the death of one \"Judas whom we  have mentioned before,\"[2] though again there was no previous mention of  the warrior. In the same chapter he describes some magical plant,  \"Baaras, possessing power to drive away demons, which are no other than  the spirits of the wicked that enter into living men and kill them,  unless they obtain some help against them.\" This apparently was a  commonplace of Palestinian natural science, as known to the Greco-Roman  world, and Josephus simply copied it.    [Footnote 1: B.J. VII. iv. 4.]    [Footnote 2: B.J. VII. vi. 4.]    The Zealots still maintained resistance in remote parts of the country,  and the legate Bassus was sent to take their three fortresses. He died  before the capture of Masada, the last stronghold, a natural fastness  overlooking the Dead Sea, which had been fortified by Herod. In this  region David and centuries later the Maccabean heroes had found a refuge  at their time of distress, and here the Jewish people were to show that  desperate heroism of their race which is evoked when all save honor is  lost. Masada had been occupied by Eleazar, a grandson of Judas of  Galilee, the leader of the most fanatical section of the Zealots; and it  fell to the procurator Flavius Silva to reduce it.    Josephus utters a final outburst against the hated nationalist party and  especially its two leaders, Simon of Gioras and John of Gischala, though  both had become victims of Roman revenge. \"That was a time,\" he  exclaims, \"most prolific in wicked practices, nor could anyone devise  any new evil, so deeply were they infected, striving with each other  individually and collectively who should run to the greatest lengths of  impiety towards God and in unjust actions towards their neighbors.\" The  more incongruous is it that after this invective he puts into Eleazar's  mouth two long speeches, calling on his men to kill themselves rather  than fall into the hands of the Romans, which sum up eloquently the  Zealot attitude.[1] Josephus indeed introduces in the speech the  Hellenized doctrine of immortality, which regards the soul as an  invisible spirit imprisoned in the mortal body and seeking relief from  its prison. He goes on, however, to make the Jewish commander point out  how preferable is death to life servitude to the Romans, in a way in  which Eleazar might himself have spoken.    [Footnote 1: B.J. VII. viii.]    \"'And as for those who have died in the war, we should deem them  blessed, for they are dead in defending, and not in betraying, their  liberty: but as to the multitude of those that have submitted to the  Romans, who would not pity their condition? And who would not make haste  to die before he would suffer the same miseries? Where is now that great  city, the metropolis of the Jewish nation, which was fortified by so  many walls round about, which had so many fortresses and large towers to  defend it, which could hardly contain the instruments prepared for the  war, and which had so many myriads of men to fight for it? Where is this  city that God Himself inhabited? It is now demolished to the very  foundations; and hath nothing but that monument of it preserved, I mean  the camp of those that have destroyed it, which still dwells upon its  ruins; some unfortunate old men also lie upon the ashes of the Temple,  and a few women are there preserved alive by the enemy for our bitter  shame and reproach. Now, who is there that revolves these things in his  mind, and yet is able to bear the sight of the"]]]
