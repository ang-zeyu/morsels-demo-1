And now at once  The portals are thrown open--it is Paulet,  Who comes to tell us--that--the carpenters  Erect beneath our feet the murderous scaffold!       [She turns aside, overpowered by excessive anguish.    MELVIL.  O God in Heaven! Oh, tell me then how bore  The queen this terrible vicissitude?    KENNEDY (after a pause, in which she has somewhat collected herself).  Not by degrees can we relinquish life;  Quick, sudden, in the twinkling of an eye,  The separation must be made, the change  From temporal to eternal life; and God  Imparted to our mistress at this moment  His grace, to cast away each earthly hope,  And firm and full of faith to mount the skies.  No sign of pallid fear dishonored her;  No word of mourning, 'till she heard the tidings  Of Leicester's shameful treachery, the sad fate  Of the deserving youth, who sacrificed  Himself for her; the deep, the bitter anguish  Of that old knight, who lost, through her, his last,  His only hope; till then she shed no tear--  'Twas then her tears began to flow, 'twas not  Her own, but others' woe which wrung them from her.    MELVIL.  Where is she now? Can you not lead me to her?    KENNEDY.  She spent the last remainder of the night  In prayer, and from her dearest friends she took  Her last farewell in writing: then she wrote  Her will [1] with her own hand. She now enjoys  A moment of repose, the latest slumber  Refreshes her weak spirits.    MELVIL.                 Who attends her?    KENNEDY.  None but her women and physician Burgoyn:  You seem to look around you with surprise;  Your eyes appear to ask me what should mean  This show of splendor in the house of death.  Oh, sir, while yet we lived we suffered want;  But at our death plenty returns to us.        SCENE II.       Enter MARGARET CURL.    KENNEDY.  How, madam, fares the queen? Is she awake?    CURL (drying her tears).  She is already dressed--she asks for you.    KENNEDY.  I go:--     [To MELVIL, who seems to wish to accompany her.      But follow not until the queen  Has been prepared to see you.                    [Exit.    CURL.                  Melvil, sure,  The ancient steward?    MELVIL.             Yes, the same.    CURL.                     Oh, sir,  This is a house which needs no steward now!  Melvil, you come from London; can you give  No tidings of my husband?    MELVIL.                It is said  He will be set at liberty as soon----    CURL.  As soon as our dear queen shall be no more.  Oh, the unworthy, the disgraceful traitor!  He is our lady's murderer--'tis said  It was his testimony which condemned him.    MELVIL.  'Tis true.    CURL.        Oh, curse upon him! Be his soul  Condemned forever! he has borne false witness.    MELVIL.  Think, madam, what you say.    CURL.                 I will maintain it  With every sacred oath before the court,  I will repeat it in his very face;  The world shall hear of nothing else. I say  That she dies innocent!    MELVIL..               God grant it true!      [1] The document is now in the British Museum.        SCENE III.       Enter HANNAH KENNEDY.    KENNEDY (to CURL).  Go, madam, and require a cup of wine--  'Tis for our lady.    MELVIL.            Is the queen then sick?    KENNEDY.  She thinks that she is strong; she is deceived  By her heroic courage; she believes  She has no need of nourishment; yet still  A hard and painful task's allotted her.  Her enemies shall not enjoy the triumph;  They shall not say that fear hath blanched her cheeks  When her fatigues have conquered human weakness.    MELVIL.  May I approach her?    KENNEDY.             She will come herself.        SCENE IV.       Enter BURGOYN; two women of the chamber follow him,     weeping, and in deep mourning.    BURGOYN.  Oh, Melvil!    MELVIL.         Oh, Burgoyn!       [They embrace silently.    FIRST WOMAN (to the NURSE).                She chose to be  Alone: she wishes, at this awful moment,  For the last time, to commune with her God.        SCENE V.       Enter MARGARET CURL, bearing a golden cup of wine;     she places it hastily upon the table, and leans,     pale and trembling, against a chair.    MELVIL.  How, madam! What has frightened you?    KENNEDY.                      Oh God!    BURGOYN.  Speak, madam!    CURL.          What, alas! have I beheld!    MELVIL.  Come to yourself, and say what you have seen!    CURL.  As I went down the staircase which conducts  To the great hall below, a door stood open;  I looked into the chamber, and I saw--  Oh heaven!    MELVIL.        What saw you?    CURL.                All the walls were hung  With black; a spacious scaffold, too, o'erspread  With sable cloth, was raised above the floor,  And in the middle of the scaffold stood  A dreadful sable block! upon it lay  A naked, polished axe:--the hall was full  Of cruel people, crowding round the scaffold  Who, with a horrid thirst for human blood,  Seemed waiting for the victim!    THE WOMEN.                  Gracious heaven,  Protect our queen!    MELVIL.            Be calm; the queen approaches.        SCENE VI.       Enter MARY in white and sumptuously arrayed, as     for a festival: she wears hanging from her neck,     on a row of small beads, an Agnus Dei; a rosary     hangs from her girdle; she bears a crucifix in     her hand, and a diadem of precious stones binds     her hair; her large black veil is thrown back.     On her entrance all present fall back on both sides     with the most violent expressions of anguish.     MELVIL falls involuntarily upon his knees.    MARY (with quiet majesty, looking round the whole circle).  Why these complaints? Why weep ye? Ye should rather  Rejoice with me, that now at length the end  Of my long woe approaches; that my shackles  Fall off, my prison opens, and my soul  Delighted mounts on seraph's wings, and seeks  The land of everlasting liberty.  When I was offered up to the oppression  Of my proud enemy, was forced to suffer  Ignoble taunts, and insults most unfitting  A free and sovereign queen, then was the time  To weep for me; but as an earnest friend,  Beneficent and healing death approaches.  All the indignities which I have suffered  On earth are covered by his sable wings.  The most degraded criminal's ennobled  By his last sufferings, by his final exit;  I feel again the crown upon my brows.  And dignity possess my swelling soul!       [Advancing a few steps.    How! Melvil here! My worthy sir, not so;  Arise; you rather come in time to see  The triumph of your mistress than her death.  One comfort, which I never had expected,  Is granted me, that after death my name  Will not be quite abandoned to my foes;  One friend at least, one partner of my faith,  Will be my witness in the hour of death.  Say, honest Melvil, how you fared the while  In this inhospitable, hostile land?  For since the time they tore you from my side  My fears for you have oft depressed my soul.    MELVIL.  No other evil galled me but my grief  For thee, and that I wanted power to serve thee.    MARY.  How fares my chamberlain, old Didier?  But sure the faithful servant long has slept  The sleep of death, for he was full of years.    MELVIL.  God hath not granted him as yet this grace;  He lives to see the grave o'erwhelm thy youth.    MARY.  Oh! could I but have felt before my death,  The happiness of pressing one descendant  Of the dear blood of Stuart to my bosom.  But I must suffer in a foreign land,  None but my servants to bewail my fate!  Sir; to your loyal bosom I commit  My latest wishes. Bear then, sir, my blessing  To the most Christian king, my royal brother,  And the whole royal family of France.  I bless the cardinal, my honored uncle,  And also Henry Guise, my noble cousin.  I bless the holy father, the vicegerent  Of Christ on earth, who will, I trust, bless me.  I bless the King of Spain, who nobly offered  Himself as my deliverer, my avenger.  They are remembered in my will: I hope  That they will not despise, how poor soe'er  They be, the presents of a heart which loves them.       [Turning to her servants.    I have bequeathed you to my royal brother  Of France; he will protect you, he will give you  Another country, and a better home;  And if my last desire have any weight,  Stay not in England; let no haughty Briton  Glut his proud heart with your calamities,  Nor see those in the dust who once were mine.  Swear by this image of our suffering Lord  To leave this fatal land when I'm no more.    MELVIL (touching the crucifix).  I swear obedience in the name of all.    MARY.  What I, though poor and plundered, still possess,  Of which I am allowed to make disposal,  Shall be amongst you shared; for I have hope  In this at least my will may be fulfilled.  And what I wear upon my way to death  Is yours--nor envy me on this occasion  The pomp of earth upon the road to heaven.       [To the ladies of her chamber.    To you, my Alice, Gertrude, Rosamund,  I leave my pearls, my garments: you are young,  And ornament may still delight your hearts.  You, Margaret, possess the nearest claims,  To you I should be generous: for I leave you  The most unhappy woman of them all.  That I have not avenged your husband's fault  On you I hope my legacy will prove.  The worth of gold, my Hannah, charms not thee;  Nor the magnificence of precious stones:  My memory, I know, will be to thee  The dearest jewel; take this handkerchief,  I worked it for thee, in the hours of sorrow,  With my own hands, and my hot, scalding tears  Are woven in the texture:--you will bind  My eyes with this, when it is time: this last  Sad service I would wish but from my Hannah.    KENNEDY.  O Melvil! I cannot support it.    MARY.                   Come,  Come all and now receive my last farewell.

From this statement it would appear to follow that between matter and  form, between passivity and activity, there must be a middle state, and  that beauty plants us in this state. It actually happens that the  greater part of mankind really form this conception of beauty as soon as  they begin to reflect on its operations, and all experience seems to  point to this conclusion. But, on the other hand, nothing is more  unwarrantable and contradictory than such a conception, because the  aversion of matter and form, the passive and the active, feeling and  thought, is eternal, and cannot be mediated in any way. How can we  remove this contradiction? Beauty weds the two opposed conditions of  feeling and thinking, and yet there is absolutely no medium between them.  The former is immediately certain through experience, the other through  the reason.    This is the point to which the whole question of beauty leads, and if we  succeed in settling this point in a satisfactory way, we have at length  found the clue that will conduct us through the whole labyrinth of  aesthetics.    But this requires two very different operations, which must necessarily  support each other in this inquiry. Beauty, it is said, weds two  conditions with one another which are opposite to each other, and can  never be one. We must start from this opposition; we must grasp and  recognize them in their entire purity and strictness, so that both  conditions are separated in the most definite manner; otherwise we mix,  but we do not unite them. Secondly, it is usual to say, beauty unites  those two opposed conditions, and therefore removes the opposition. But  because both conditions remain eternally opposed to one another, they  cannot be united in any other way than by being suppressed. Our second  business is therefore to make this connection perfect, to carry them out  with such purity and perfection that both conditions disappear entirely  in a third one, and no trace of separation remains in the whole;  otherwise we segregate, but do not unite. All the disputes that have  ever prevailed and still prevail in the philosophical world respecting  the conception of beauty have no other origin than their commencing  without a sufficiently strict distinction, or that it is not carried out  fully to a pure union. Those philosophers who blindly follow their  feeling in reflecting on this topic can obtain no other conception of  beauty, because they distinguish nothing separate in the totality of the  sensuous impression. Other philosophers, who take the understanding as  their exclusive guide, can never obtain a conception of beauty, because  they never see anything else in the whole than the parts; and spirit and  matter remain eternally separate, even in their most perfect unity. The  first fear to suppress beauty dynamically, that is, as a working power,  if they must separate what is united in the feeling. The others fear to  suppress beauty logically, that is, as a conception, when they have to  hold together what in the understanding is separate. The former wish to  think of beauty as it works; the latter wish it to work as it is thought.  Both therefore must miss the truth; the former, because they try to  follow infinite nature with their limited thinking power; the others,  because they wish to limit unlimited nature according to their laws of  thought. The first fear to rob beauty of its freedom by a too strict  dissection, the others fear to destroy the distinctness of the conception  by a too violent union. But the former do not reflect that the freedom  in which they very properly place the essence of beauty is not  lawlessness, but harmony of laws; not caprice, but the highest internal  necessity. The others do not remember that distinctness, which they with  equal right demand from beauty, does not consist in the exclusion of  certain realities, but the absolute including of all; that is not  therefore limitation but infinitude. We shall avoid the quicksands on  which both have made shipwreck if we begin from the two elements in which  beauty divides itself before the understanding, but then afterwards rise  to a pure aesthetic unity by which it works on feeling, and in which both  those conditions completely disappear.          LETTER XIX.      Two principal and different states of passive and active capacity of  being determined [Bestimmbarkeit] can be distinguished in man; in like  manner two states of passive and active determination [Bestimmung]. The  explanation of this proposition leads us most readily to our end.    The condition of the state of man before destination or direction is  given him by the impression of the senses is an unlimited capacity of  being determined. The infinite of time and space is given to his  imagination for its free use; and, because nothing is settled in this  kingdom of the possible, and therefore nothing is excluded from it, this  state of absence of determination can be named an empty infiniteness,  which must not by any means be confounded with an infinite void.    Now it is necessary that his sensuous nature should be modified, and that  in the indefinite series of possible determinations one alone should  become real. One perception must spring up in it. That which, in the  previous state of determinableness, was only an empty potency becomes now  an active force, and receives contents; but, at the same time, as an  active force it receives a limit, after having been, as a simple power,  unlimited. Reality exists now, but the infinite has disappeared. To  describe a figure in space, we are obliged to limit infinite space; to  represent to ourselves a change in time, we are obliged to divide the  totality of time. Thus we only arrive at reality by limitation, at the  positive, at a real position, by negation or exclusion; to determination,  by the suppression of our free determinableness.    But mere exclusion would never beget a reality, nor would a mere sensuous  impression ever give birth to a perception, if there were not something  from which it was excluded, if by an absolute act of the mind the  negation were not referred to something positive, and if opposition did  not issue out of non-position. This act of the mind is styled judging or  thinking, and the result is named thought.    Before we determine a place in space, there is no space for us; but  without absolute space we could never determine a place. The same is the  case with time. Before we have an instant, there is no time to us: but  without infinite time--eternity--we should never have a representation of  the instant. Thus, therefore, we can only arrive at the whole by the  part, to the unlimited through limitation; but reciprocally we only  arrive at the part through the whole, at limitation through the  unlimited.    It follows from this, that when it is affirmed of beauty that it mediates  for man, the transition from feeling to thought, this must not be  understood to mean that beauty can fill up the gap that separates feeling  from thought, the passive from the active. This gap is infinite; and,  without the interposition of a new and independent faculty, it is  impossible for the general to issue from the individual, the necessary  from the contingent. Thought is the immediate act of this absolute  power, which, I admit, can only be manifested in connection with sensuous  impressions, but which in this manifestation depends so little on the  sensuous that it reveals itself specially in an opposition to it. The  spontaneity or autonomy with which it acts excludes every foreign  influence; and it is not in as far as it helps thought--which comprehends  a manifest contradiction but only in as far as it procures for the  intellectual faculties the freedom to manifest themselves in conformity  with their proper laws. It does it only because the beautiful can become  a means of leading man from matter to form, from feeling to laws, from a  limited existence to an absolute existence.    But this assumes that the freedom of the intellectual faculties can be  balked, which appears contradictory to the conception of an autonomous  power. For a power which only receives the matter of its activity from  without can only be hindered in its action by the privation of this  matter, and consequently by way of negation; it is therefore a  misconception of the nature of the mind to attribute to the sensuous  passions the power of oppressing positively the freedom of the mind.  Experience does indeed present numerous examples where the rational  forces appear compressed in proportion to the violence of the sensuous  forces. But instead of deducing this spiritual weakness from the energy  of passion, this passionate energy must rather be explained by the  weakness of the human mind. For the sense can only have a sway such as  this over man when the mind has spontaneously neglected to assert its  power.    Yet in trying by these explanations to move one objection, I appear to  have exposed myself to another, and I have only saved the autonomy of the  mind at the cost of its unity. For how can the mind derive at the same  time from itself the principles of inactivity and of activity, if it is  not itself divided, and if it is not in opposition with itself?    Here we must remember that we have before us, not the infinite mind, but  the finite. The finite mind is that which only becomes active through  the passive, only arrives at the absolute through limitation, and only  acts and fashions in as far as it receives matter. Accordingly, a mind  of this nature must associate with the impulse towards form or the  absolute, an impulse towards matter or limitation, conditions without  which it could not have the former impulse nor satisfy it. How can two  such opposite tendencies exist together in the same being? This"]]]
