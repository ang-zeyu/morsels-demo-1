[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#2)"],[1,"a period of one thousand seven hundred years, I  commenced with the accession of the house of Stuart, an epoch when, I  thought, the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take  place.  I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the success of  this work.  I thought that I was the only historian that had at once  neglected present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of  popular prejudices; and as the subject was suited to every capacity,  I expected proportional applause.  But miserable was my  disappointment: I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation,  and even detestation; English, Scotch, and Irish, whig and tory,  churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and  courtier, united in their rage against the man who had presumed to  shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of  Strafford; and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over,  what was still more mortifying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion.  Mr. Miller told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five  copies of it.  I scarcely, indeed, heard of one man in the three  kingdoms, considerable for rank or letters, that could endure the  book.  I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the  primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions.  These  dignified prelates separately sent me a message not to be discouraged.    I was, however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war at that  time been breaking out between France and England, I had certainly  retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my  name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this  scheme was not now practicable, and the  subsequent volume was  considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to persevere.    In this interval I published at London my Natural History of Religion,  along with some other small pieces: its public entry was rather  obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with  all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility, which  distinguish the Warburtonian school.  This pamphlet gave me some  consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance.    In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume, was published  the second volume of my History, containing the period from the death  of Charles I. till the Revolution.  This performance happened to give  less displeasure to the whigs, and was better received.  It not only  rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.    But though I had been taught by experience, that the whig party were  in possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in  literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless  clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther study,  reading, or reflection, engaged me to make in the reigns of the two  first Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the tory side.  It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that  period as a regular plan of liberty.    In 1759 I published my History of the House of Tudor.  The clamour  against this performance was almost equal to that against the History  of the two first Stuarts.  The reign of Elizabeth was particularly  obnoxious.  But I was now callous against the impressions of public  folly, and continued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat in  Edinburgh, to finish, in two volumes, the more early part of the  English History, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable,  and but tolerable, success.    But notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons to which my  writings have been exposed, they had still been making such advances,  that the copy-money given me by the booksellers much exceeded any  thing formerly known in England: I retired to my native country of  Scotland, determined never more to set my foot out of it; and  retaining the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to one  great man, or even making advances of friendship to any of them.  As I  was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life  in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation  from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least  acquainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris, with a near  prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in the  meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office.  This offer,  however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was reluctant to  begin connexions with the great, and because I was afraid that the  civilities and gay company of Paris would prove disagreeable to a  person of my age and humour: but on his lordship's repeating the  invitation, I accepted of it.  I have every reason, both of pleasure  and interest, to think myself happy in my connexions with that  nobleman, as well as afterwards with his brother General Conway.    Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes will never  imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all  ranks and stations.  The more I resiled from their excessive  civilities, the more I was loaded with them.  There is, however, a  real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of  sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds  above all places in the universe.  I thought once of settling there  for life.    I was appointed secretary to the embassy; and in summer, 1765, Lord  Hertford left me, being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  I was  charge d'affaires till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond, towards  the end of the year.  In the beginning of 1766 I left Paris, and next  summer went to Edinburgh, with the same view as formerly of burying  myself in a philosophical retreat. I returned to that place, not  richer, but with much more money, and a much larger income, by means  of Lord Hertford's friendship, than I left it; and I was desirous of  trying what superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an  experiment of a competency.  But in 1767 I received from Mr. Conway an  invitation to be under-secretary; and this invitation, both the  character of the person, and my connexions with Lord Hertford,  prevented me from declining.  I returned to Edinburgh in 1769, very  opulent, (for I possessed a revenue of 1000L. a year,) healthy, and,  though somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long  my ease, and of seeing the increase of my reputation.    In spring, 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at  first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become  mortal and incurable.  I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution.  I have  suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange  have, notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a  moment's abatement of my spirits, inasmuch that were I to name a  period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I  might be tempted to point to this later period.  I possess the same  ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company.  I consider,  besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years  of infirmities; and though I see many symptoms of my literary  reputation's breaking out at last with additional lustre, I know that  I could have but few years to enjoy it.  It is difficult to be more  detached from life than I am at present.    To conclude historically with my own character.  I am, or rather was,  (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which  emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments)--I was, I say, a man of  mild disposition, of command of temper, of an open, social, and  cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of  enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions.  Even my love of  literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper,  notwithstanding my frequent disappointments.  My company was not  unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and  literary; and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest  women, I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with  from them.  In a word, though most men, anywise eminent, have found  reason to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked  by her baleful tooth; and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage  of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my  behalf of their wonted fury.  My friends never had occasion to  vindicate any one circumstance of my  character and conduct: not but  that the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent  and propagate any story to my disadvantage, but they could never find  any which they thought would wear the face of probability.  I cannot  say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself; but I  hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is  easily cleared and ascertained.      April 18, 1776.          LETTER    FROM    ADAM SMITH. LL. D.    To    WILLIAM STRAHAN, ESQ.      Kirkaldy, Fifeshire, Nov. 9, 1776    DEAR SIR,    It is with a real, though a very melancholy pleasure, that I sit down  to give you some account of the behaviour of our late excellent  friend, Mr. Hume, during his last illness.    Though in his own judgment his disease was mortal and incurable, yet  he allowed himself to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his  friends, to try what might be the effects of a long journey.  A few  days before he set out, he wrote that account of his own life, which,  together with his other papers, he has left to your care. My account,  therefore, shall begin where his ends.    He set out for London towards the end of April, and at Morpeth met  with Mr. John Home, and myself, who had both come down from London on  purpose to see him, expecting to have found him at Edinburgh.  Mr.  Home returned with him, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10580"],[0,"The Positive School of Criminology (#2)"],[1,"proportional to the crime of patricide? Neither  science, nor legislation, nor moral consciousness, can offer an absolute  standard. Some say: The greatest penalty is death. Others say: No,  imprisonment for life. Still others say: Neither death, nor imprisonment  for life, but only imprisonment for a time. And if imprisonment for a  time is to be the highest penalty, how many years shall it last  --thirty, or twenty-five, or ten?    No man can set up any absolute standard in this matter. Giovanni Bovio  thus arrived at the conclusion that this internal contradiction in the  science of criminology was the inevitable fate of human justice, and  that this justice, struggling in the grasp of this internal  contradiction, must turn to the civil law and ask for help in its  weakness. The same thought had already been illumined by a ray from the  bright mind of Filangieri, who died all too soon. And we can derive from  this fact the historical rule that the most barbarian conditions of  humanity show a prevalence of a criminal code which punishes without  healing; and that the gradual progress of civilization will give rise  to the opposite conception of healing without punishing.    Thus it happens that this university of Naples, in which the illustrious  representative of the classic school of criminology realized the  necessity of its regeneration, and in which Bovio foresaw its sterility,  has younger teachers now who keep alive the fire of the positivist  tendency in criminal science, such as Penta, Zuccarelli, and others,  whom you know. Nevertheless I feel that this faculty of jurisprudence  still lacks oxygen in the study of criminal law, because its thought is  still influenced by the overwhelming authority of the name of Enrico  Pessina. And it is easy to understand that there, where the majestic  tree spreads out its branches towards the blue vault, the young plant  feels deprived of light and air, while it might have grown strong and  beautiful in another place.    The positive school of criminology, then, was born in our own Italy  through the singular attraction of the Italian mind toward the study of  criminology; and its birth is also due to the peculiar condition our  country with its great and strange contrast between the theoretical  doctrines and the painful fact of an ever increasing criminality.    The positive school of criminology was inaugurate by the work of Cesare  Lombroso, in 1872. From 1872 to 1876 he opened a new way for the study  of criminality by demonstrating in his own person that we must first  understand the criminal who offends, before we can study and understand  his crime. Lombroso studied the prisoners in the various penitentiaries  of Italy from the point of view of anthropology. And he compiled his  studies in the reports of the Lombardian Institute of Science and  Literature, and published them later together in his work \"Criminal  Man.\" The first edition of this work (1876) remained almost unnoticed,  either because its scientific material was meager, or because Cesare  Lombroso had not yet drawn any general scientific conclusions, which  could have attracted the attention of the world of science and law. But  simultaneously with its second edition (1878) there appeared two  monographs, which constituted the embryo of the new school,  supplementing the anthropological studies of Lombroso with conclusions  and systematizations from the point of view of sociology and law.  Raffaele Garofalo published in the Neapolitan Journal of Philosophy and  Literature an essay on criminality, in which he declared that the  dangerousness of the criminal was the criterion by which society should  measure the function of its defense against the disease of crime. And in  the same year, 1878, I took occasion to publish a monograph on the  denial of free will and personal responsibility, in which I declared  frankly that from now on the science of crime and punishment must look  for the fundamental facts of a science of social defense against crime  in the human and social life itself. The simultaneous publication of  these three monographs caused a stir. The teachers of classic  criminology, who had taken kindly to the recommendations of Pessina and  Ellero, urging them to study the natural sources of crime, met the new  ideas with contempt, when the new methods made a determined and radical  departure, and became not only the critics, but the zealous opponents of  the new theories. And this is easy to understand. For the struggle for  existence is an irresistible law of nature, as well for the thousands of  germs scattered to the winds by the oak, as for the ideas which grow in  the brain of man. But persecutions, calumnies, criticisms, and  opposition are powerless against an idea, if it carries within itself  the germ of truth. Moreover, we should look upon this phenomenon of a  repugnance in the average intellect (whether of the ordinary man or the  scientist) for all new ideas as a natural function. For when the brain  of some man has felt the light of a new idea, a sneering criticism  serves us a touchstone for it. If the idea is wrong, it will fall by the  wayside; if it is right, then criticisms, opposition and persecution  will cull the golden kernel from the unsightly shell, and the idea will  march victoriously over everything and everybody. It is so in all walks  of life--in art, in politics, in science. Every new idea will rouse  against itself naturally and inevitably the opposition of the accustomed  thoughts. This is so true, that when Cesare Beccaria opened the great  historic cycle of the classic school of criminology, he was assaulted by  the critics of his time with the same indictments which were brought  against us a century later.    When Cesare Beccaria printed his book on crime and penalties in 1774  under a false date and place of publication, reflecting the aspirations  which gave rise to the impending hurricane of the French revolution;  when he hurled himself against all that was barbarian in the mediaeval  laws and set loose a storm of enthusiasm among the encyclopedists, and  even some of the members of government, in France, he was met by a wave  of opposition, calumny and accusation on the part of the majority of  jurists, judges and lights of philosophy. The abbe Jachinci published  four volumes against Beccaria, calling him the destroyer of justice and  morality, simply because he had combatted the tortures and the death  penalty.    The tortures, which we incorrectly ascribe to the mental brutality of  the judges of those times, were but a logical consequence of the  contemporaneous theories. It was felt that in order to condemn a man,  one must have the certainty of his guilty, and it was said that the best  means of obtaining tins certainty, the queen of proofs, was the  confession of the criminal. And if the criminal denied his guilt, it was  necessary to have recourse to torture, in order to force him to a  confession which he withheld from fear of the penalty. The torture  soothed, so to say, the conscience of the judge, who was free to condemn  as soon as he had obtained a confession. Cesare Beccaria rose with  others against the torture. Thereupon the judges and jurists protested  that penal justice would be impossible, because it could not get any  information, since a man suspected of a crime would not confess his  guilt voluntarily. Hence they accused Beccaria of being the protector of  robbers and murderers, because he wanted to abolish the only means of  compelling them to a confession, the torture. But Cesare Beccaria had on  his side the magic power of truth. He was truly the electric accumulator  of his time, who gathered from its atmosphere the presage of the coming  revolution, the stirring of the human conscience. You can find a similar  illustration in the works of Daquin in Savoy, of Pinel in France, and of  Hach Take in England, who strove to bring about a revolution in the  treatment of the insane. This episode interests us especially, because  it is a perfect illustration of the way traveled by the positive school  of criminology. The insane were likewise considered to blame for their  insanity. At the dawn of the 19th century, the physician Hernroth still  wrote that insanity was a moral sin of the insane, because \"no one  becomes insane, unless he forsakes the straight path of virtue and of  the fear of the Lord.\"    And on this assumption the insane were locked up in horrible dungeons,  loaded down with chains, tortured and beaten, for lo! their insanity was  their own fault.    At that period, Pinel advanced the revolutionary idea that insanity was  not a sin, but a disease like all other diseases. This idea is now a  commonplace, but in his time it revolutionized the world. It seemed as  though this innovation inaugurated by Pinel would overthrow the world  and the foundations of society. Well, two years before the storming of  the Bastile Pinel walked into the sanitarium of the Salpetriere and  committed the brave act of freeing the insane of the chains that weighed  them down. He demonstrated in practice that the insane, when freed of  their chains, became quieter, instead of creating wild disorder and  destruction. This great revolution of Pinel, Chiarugi, and others,  changed the attitude of the public mind toward the insane. While  formerly insanity had been regarded as a moral sin, the public  conscience, thanks to the enlightening work of science, henceforth had  to adapt itself to the truth that insanity is a disease like all  others, that a man does not become insane because he wants to, but that  he becomes insane through hereditary transmission and the influence of  the environment in which he lives, being predisposed toward insanity and  becoming insane under the pressure of circumstances.    The positive school of criminology accomplished the same revolution in  the views concerning the treatment of criminals "]]]
