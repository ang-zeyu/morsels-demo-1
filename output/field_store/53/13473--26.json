[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#2)"],[1," Christian doctrines as they were known in heterodox Syria, far off from  the main stream of Christian life and teaching. He went to them with a  prejudiced mind, full of anger against their exponents for declaring the  Messiah to be the Son of God. The whole idea of the Incarnation and the  dogma of the Trinity were thoroughly abhorrent to him, and the only  conception he entertains as to the personality of Jesus is that of a  Prophet even as he is himself, the receiver of divine inspiration, but  having no connection in essence with God, whom he conceived pre-eminently  as the one supreme Being, indivisible in nature. Certainly he knew far  less of the Christian than of the Jewish Scriptures, and necessarily less  of the inner meaning of the Christian faith, still in fluid state,  unconsidered of its profoundest future exponents. His mind was assuredly  not attuned to the reception of its more revolutionary ideas. Very little  compassion and no tenderness breathe from the pages of the Kuran, and  from a religion whose Founder had laboured to bring just those two  elements into the thorny ways of the world, Mahomet could only turn away  baffled and uncomprehending. The doctrine of the non-resistance to evil,  and indeed all the wisdom of the Sermon on the Mount, he passed by  unseeing.    It is useless and indeed unfair to attempt the comparison of Mahomedanism  with Christianity, seeing that without the preliminary culture of Greece  and Rome modern Christian doctrines would not exist in their present  form, and of the former Mahomet had no cognisance. He stands altogether  apart from the Christian system, finding no affinity in its doctrines or  practices, scorning its monasticism no less than its conception of the  Trinity. His position in history lies between the warriors and the  saints, at the head of the Prophets, who went, flail in hand, to summon  to repentance, but unlike the generality, bearing also the sword and  sceptre of a kingdom.    No other religious leader has ever bound his creed so closely to definite  political conceptions, Mahomet was not only the instrument of divine  revelation, but he was also at the end of his life the head of a temporal  state with minutest laws and regulations--chaotic it may be, but still  binding so that Islamic influence extended over the whole of the lives of  its adherents. This constitutes its strength. Its leader swayed not only  the convictions but the activities of his subjects.    His position with regard to the political institution of other countries  is unique. His temporal power grew almost in spite of himself, and he  unconsciously adopted ideas in connection with it which arose out of the  circumstances involved. Any form of government except despotism was  impossible among so heterogeneous and unruly a people; despotism also  bore out his own idea as to the nature of God's governance. Political  ideas were largely built upon religious conceptions, sometimes  outstripping, sometimes lagging behind them, but always with some  irrefragable connection. Despotism, therefore, was the form best suited  to Islam, and becomes its chief legacy to posterity, since without the  religious sanction Islam politically could not exist.    Together with despotism and inextricably mingled with it is the second  great Islamic enthusiasm--the belief in the supremacy of force. With  violence the Muslim kingdom was to be attained. Mahomet gave to the  battle lust of Arabia the approval of his puissant deity, bidding his  followers put their supreme faith in the arbitrament of the sword. He  knew, too, the value of diplomacy and the use of well-calculated  treachery, but chief of all he bade his followers arm themselves to seize  by force what they could not obtain by cunning. In the insistence upon  these two factors, complete obedience to his will as the revelation of  Allah's decrees and the justification of violence to proclaim the merits  of his faith, we gain the nearest approach to his character and beliefs;  for these, together with his conception of fate, are perhaps the most  personal of all his institutions.    Mahomet has suffered not a little at the hands of his immediate successors.  They have sought to record the full sum of his personality, and finding  the subject elude them, as the translation of actions into words must  ever fall short of finality, they have overloaded their narrative with  minutest and almost always apocryphal details which leave the main  outlines blurred. Only two biographies can be said to be in the nature  of sources, that of Muhammad ibn Hischam, written on the model of  an earlier biography, undertaken about 760 for the Abbasside Caliph  Mansur, and of Wakidi, written about 820, which is important as  containing the text of many treaties made by Mahomet with various tribes.  Al-Tabari, too, included the life of Mahomet in his extensive history of  Arabia, but his work serves only as a check, consisting, as it  does, mainly of extracts from Wakidi. By far the more valuable is the  Kuran and the Sunna of tradition. But even these are fragmentary and  confused, bearing upon them the ineradicable stamp of alien writers and  much second-hand thought.    In the dim, pregnant dawn of religions, by the transfusing power of a  great idea, seized upon and made living by a single personality, the  world of imagination mingles with the world of fact as we perceive it.  The real is felt to be merely the frail shell of forces more powerful and  permanent. Legend and myth crowd in upon actual life as imperfect  vehicles for the compelling demand made by that new idea for expression.  Moreover, personality, that subtle essence, exercises a kind of  centripetal force, attracting not only the devotion but the imaginations  of those who come within its influence.    Mahomet, together with all the men of action in history, possessed an  energy of will so vast as to bring forth the creative faculties of his  adherents, and the legends that cluster round him have a special  significance as the measure of his personality and influence. The  story, for instance, of his midnight journey into the seven heavens  is the symbol of an intense spiritual experience that, following the  mental temper of the age in which he lived, had to be translated into  the concrete. All the affirmations as to his intercourse with Djinn,  his inspiration by the angel Gabriel, are inherent factors in the  manifestation of his ceaseless mental activity. His marvellous birth and  the myths of his childhood are the sum of his followers' devotion, and  reveal their reverence translated into terms of the imagination.  Character was the mysterious force that his co-religionists tried  unconsciously to portray in all those legends relative to his life at  Medina, his ruthlessness and cruelty finding a place no less than his  humility, and steadfastness under discouragement.    But beneath the weight of the marvellous the real man is almost buried.  He has stood for so long with the mists of obscure imaginings about him  that his true lineaments are almost impossible to reproduce. The Western  world has alternated between the conception of him as a devil, almost  Antichrist himself, and a negligible impostor whose power is transient.  It has seldom troubled to look for the human energy that wrought out his  successes, the faith that upheld them, and the enthusiasm that burned in  the Prophet himself with a sombre flame, lighting his followers to prayer  and conquest.    And indeed it is difficult, if not impossible, to re-create effectively  the world in which he lived. It is so remote from the seas of the  world's progression, an eddy in the tide of belief which loses itself in  the larger surging, that it makes no appeal of familiarity. But that a  study of the period and Mahomet's own personality operating no less  through his deeds, faith, and institutions than in the one doubtfully  reliable record of his teachings, will result in the perception of the  Prophet of Islam as a man among men, has been the central belief during  the writing of this biography. Mahomet's personality is revealed in his  dealing with his fellows, in the belief and ritual that he imposed upon  Arabia, in the mighty achievement of a political unity and military  discipline, and therein he shows himself inexorable, cruel, passionate,  treacherous, bad, subject to depression and overwhelming doubt, but  never weak or purposeless, continually the master of his circumstances,  whom no emergency found unprepared, whose confidence in himself nothing  could shake, and who by virtue of enthusiasm and resistless activity  wrested his triumphs from the hands of his enemies, and bequeathed to  his followers his own unconquerable faith and the means wherewith they  might attain wealth and sovereignty.          CHAPTER I      MAHOMET'S BIRTHPLACE      \"And how many cities were mightier in strength than thy city that    hath cast thee forth?\"--_The Kuran_.    In Arabia nature cannot be ignored. Pastures and cornland, mountain  slopes and quiet rivers may be admired, even reverenced; but they are  things external to the gaze, and make no insistent demand upon the spirit  for penetration of their mystery. Arabia, and Mecca as typical of Arabia,  is a country governed by earth's primal forces. It has not yet emerged  from the shadow of that early world, bare and chaotic, where a blinding  sun pours down upon dusty mountain ridges, and nothing is temperate or  subdued. It fosters a race of men, whose gods are relentless and  inscrutable, revealing themselves seldom, and dwelling in a fierce  splendour beyond earthly knowledge. To the spirit of a seeker for truth  with senses alert to the outer world, this country speaks of boundless  force, and impels into activity under the spur of conviction; by its very  desolation it sets its ineradicable mark upon the creed built up within  it.    Mahomet spent forty years in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#2)"],[1," of what Aunt Jane would say if she knew that I had been at the Why  Not?--and beside that, I stood in awe of grim old Elzevir Block, grimmer  and sadder a thousand times since David's death.    The Why Not? was not the real name of the inn; it was properly the Mohune  Arms. The Mohunes had once owned, as I have said, the whole of the  village; but their fortunes fell, and with them fell the fortunes of  Moonfleet. The ruins of their mansion showed grey on the hillside above  the village; their almshouses stood half-way down the street, with the  quadrangle deserted and overgrown; the Mohune image and superscription  was on everything from the church to the inn, and everything that bore it  was stamped also with the superscription of decay. And here it is  necessary that I say a few words as to this family badge; for, as you  will see, I was to bear it all my life, and shall carry its impress with  me to the grave. The Mohune shield was plain white or silver, and bore  nothing upon it except a great black 'Y. I call it a 'Y', though the  Reverend Mr. Glennie once explained to me that it was not a 'Y' at all,  but what heralds call a _cross-pall. Cross-pall_ or no _cross-pall,_ it  looked for all the world like a black 'Y', with a broad arm ending in  each of the top corners of the shield, and the tail coming down into the  bottom. You might see that cognizance carved on the manor, and on the  stonework and woodwork of the church, and on a score of houses in the  village, and it hung on the signboard over the door of the inn. Everyone  knew the Mohune 'Y' for miles around, and a former landlord having called  the inn the Why Not? in jest, the name had stuck to it ever since.    More than once on winter evenings, when men were drinking in the Why  Not?, I had stood outside, and listened to them singing 'Ducky-stones',  or 'Kegs bobbing One, Two, Three', or some of the other tunes that  sailors sing in the west. Such songs had neither beginning nor ending,  and very little sense to catch hold of in the middle. One man would crone  the air, and the others would crone a solemn chorus, but there was little  hard drinking, for Elzevir Block never got drunk himself, and did not  like his guests to get drunk either. On singing nights the room grew hot,  and the steam stood so thick on the glass inside that one could not see  in; but at other times, when there was no company, I have peeped through  the red curtains and watched Elzevir Block and Ratsey playing backgammon  at the trestle-table by the fire. It was on the trestle-table that Block  had afterwards laid out his son's dead body, and some said they had  looked through the window at night and seen the father trying to wash the  blood-matting out of the boy's yellow hair, and heard him groaning and  talking to the lifeless clay as if it could understand. Anyhow, there had  been little drinking in the inn since that time, for Block grew more and  more silent and morose. He had never courted customers, and now he  scowled on any that came, so that men looked on the Why Not? as a  blighted spot, and went to drink at the Three Choughs at Ringstave.    My heart was in my mouth when Ratsey lifted the latch and led me into the  inn parlour. It was a low sanded room with no light except a fire of  seawood on the hearth, burning clear and lambent with blue salt flames.  There were tables at each end of the room, and wooden-seated chairs round  the walls, and at the trestle table by the chimney sat Elzevir Block  smoking a long pipe and looking at the fire. He was a man of fifty, with  a shock of grizzled hair, a broad but not unkindly face of regular  features, bushy eyebrows, and the finest forehead that I ever saw. His  frame was thick-set, and still immensely strong; indeed, the countryside  was full of tales of his strange prowess or endurance. Blocks had been  landlords at the Why Not? father and son for years, but Elzevir's mother  came from the Low Countries, and that was how he got his outland name and  could speak Dutch. Few men knew much of him, and folks often wondered how  it was he kept the Why Not? on so little custom as went that way. Yet he  never seemed to lack for money; and if people loved to tell stories of  his strength, they would speak also of widows helped, and sick comforted  with unknown gifts, and hint that some of them came from Elzevir Block  for all he was so grim and silent.    He turned round and got up as we came in, and my fears led me to think  that his face darkened when he saw me.    'What does this boy want?' he said to Ratsey sharply.    'He wants the same as I want, and that's a glass of Ararat milk to keep  out autumn chills,' the sexton answered, drawing another chair up to the  trestle-table.    'Cows' milk is best for children such as he,' was Elzevir's answer, as he  took two shining brass candlesticks from the mantel-board, set them on  the table, and lit the candles with a burning chip from the hearth.    'John is no child; he is the same age as David, and comes from helping me  to finish David's headstone. 'Tis finished now, barring the paint upon  the ships, and, please God, by Monday night we will have it set fair and  square in the churchyard, and then the poor lad may rest in peace,  knowing he has above him Master Ratsey's best handiwork, and the parson's  verses to set forth how shamefully he came to his end.'    I thought that Elzevir softened a little as Ratsey spoke of his son, and  he said, 'Ay, David rests in peace. 'Tis they that brought him to his end  that shall not rest in peace when their time comes. And it may come  sooner than they think,' he added, speaking more to himself than to us. I  knew that he meant Mr. Maskew, and recollected that some had warned the  magistrate that he had better keep out of Elzevir's way, for there was no  knowing what a desperate man might do. And yet the two had met since in  the village street, and nothing worse come of it than a scowling look  from Block.    'Tush, man!' broke in the sexton, 'it was the foulest deed ever man  did; but let not thy mind brood on it, nor think how thou mayest get  thyself avenged. Leave that to Providence; for He whose wisdom lets  such things be done, will surely see they meet their due reward.  \"Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord\".' And he took his  hat off and hung it on a peg.    Block did not answer, but set three glasses on the table, and then took  out from a cupboard a little round long-necked bottle, from which he  poured out a glass for Ratsey and himself. Then he half-filled the third,  and pushed it along the table to me, saying, 'There, take it, lad, if  thou wilt; 'twill do thee no good, but may do thee no harm.'    Ratsey raised his glass almost before it was filled. He sniffed the  liquor and smacked his lips. 'O rare milk of Ararat!' he said, 'it is  sweet and strong, and sets the heart at ease. And now get the  backgammon-board, John, and set it for us on the table.' So they fell to  the game, and I took a sly sip at the liquor, but nearly choked myself,  not being used to strong waters, and finding it heady and burning in the  throat. Neither man spoke, and there was no sound except the constant  rattle of the dice, and the rubbing of the pieces being moved across the  board. Now and then one of the players stopped to light his pipe, and at  the end of a game they scored their totals on the table with a bit of  chalk. So I watched them for an hour, knowing the game myself, and being  interested at seeing Elzevir's backgammon-board, which I had heard talked  of before.    It had formed part of the furniture of the Why Not? for generations of  landlords, and served perhaps to pass time for cavaliers of the Civil  Wars. All was of oak, black and polished, board, dice-boxes, and men, but  round the edge ran a Latin inscription inlaid in light wood, which I read  on that first evening, but did not understand till Mr. Glennie translated  it to me. I had cause to remember it afterwards, so I shall set it down  here in Latin for those who know that tongue, _Ita in vita ut in lusu  alae pessima jactura arte corrigenda est_, and in English as Mr. Glennie  translated it, _As in life, so in a game of hazard, skill will make  something of the worst of throws_. At last Elzevir looked up and spoke  to me, not unkindly, 'Lad, it is time for you to go home; men say that  Blackbeard walks on the first nights of winter, and some have met him  face to face betwixt this house and yours.' I saw he wanted to be rid of  me, so bade them both good night, and was off home, running all the way  thither, though not from any fear of Blackbeard, for Ratsey had often  told me that there was no chance of meeting him unless one passed the  churchyard by night.    Blackbeard was one of the Mohunes who had died a century back, and was  buried in the vault under the church, with others of his family, but  could not rest there, whether, as some said, because he was always  looking for a lost treasure, or as others, because of his exceeding  wickedness in life. If this last were the true reason, he must have been  bad indeed, for Mohunes have died before and since his day wicked enough  to bear anyone company in their vault or elsewhere. Men would have it  that on dark winter nights Blackbeard might be seen with an old-fashioned  lanthorn digging for treasure in the graveyard; and those who professed  to know said he was the tallest of men, with full black beard, coppery  face, and such evil eyes, that any who once met their gaze must die  within a year. However that might be, there were few in Moonfleet who  would not rather walk ten miles round than go near the churchyard after  dark; and once when Cracky Jones, a poor doited body, was found there  one summer morning, lying dead on the grass, it was thought that he had  met Blackbeard in the night.    Mr. Glennie, who knew more about such things than anyone else, told me  that Blackbeard was none"]]]
