He's awfully in earnest,  Frank, and he means to kill you if you don't apologize. All the fellows  are backing him; they think you will not fight.\"    \"Is that so? Looking for me to show the white feather, are they? Well, I  like that!\"    \"But you can't fight him! I tell you he's a fire eater! I've heard that  his father killed a man in a duel.\"    \"And that makes the son dangerous! No, Harry, I can't afford to--What's  all that racket?\"    The sound of voices and of many feet ascending the stairs could be  heard. Harry turned pale.    \"They're coming, Frank!\" he exclaimed. \"It's the whole gang, and Diamond  is with them. He means to force you to fight or squeal!\"          CHAPTER II.    CHALLENGED AND HAZED.      The voices were hushed, the feet halted in the hall, and then there was  a sharp knock on the door.    Before Harry could reach the door Frank called out:    \"Come in.\"    Open flew the door, and there stood the tall, straight, dark-eyed  Southerner, with half a dozen other fellows behind him.    \"Mr. Merriwell,\" said Diamond, stiffly, \"I have called to see you on a  very important matter, sir.\"    \"Walk right in,\" invited Frank, rising to receive them. \"Bring your  friends in. State your business, Mr. Diamond.\"    The party came trooping in, and Frank was not a little astonished to  observe among them Bruce Browning, a big, strong, lazy sophomore, a  fellow who was known to be a great hand to plan deviltry which was  usually carried into execution by his friends. As for Browning, he was  not given to exerting himself when he could avoid it.    That a soph should associate with a party of freshmen seemed but a  little short of marvelous, and Frank instantly scented \"a job.\"  Believing he had been singled out for the party to \"jolly,\" his blood  was up in a moment, and he resolved to show them that he was not \"easy.\"    Jack Diamond drew himself up, his eyes fastened threateningly on Frank,  and said:    \"Sir, you had the impudence to kick my dog, and when I remonstrated with  you, you insulted me. I demand an apology before these gentlemen.\"    Frank held himself in check; he appeared as cool as an iceberg.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"your confounded dog spoiled a pair of ten-dollar  trousers for me, and I demand another pair--or satisfaction.\"    Harry Rattleton caught his breath. Was Merriwell crazy? He started  forward, as if to intervene, but Diamond, his eyes blazing, motioned him  back.    \"Very well, sir,\" said the Southerner, addressing Frank, \"you shall have  all the satisfaction you desire. Mr. Ditson will represent me.\"    Roland Ditson pressed forward. He was a loud-voiced youth who wore loud  clothes and sported a large amount of jewelry.    \"Name your second, Merriwell,\" he said in an authoritative way. \"We want  to settle this matter as soon as possible.\"    Frank named Harry, and the seconds conferred together.    Merriwell sat down and coolly awaited the result, with his hands in his  pockets. Diamond drew aside, his friends gathering about him. Bruce  Browning interested himself in what was passing between Rattleton and  Ditson, and it was plain that he was urging them to do something.    After a few minutes Harry approached Frank, a troubled look on his face.    \"It's an outrage!\" he indignantly exclaimed. \"Ditson insists that it be  a degular ruel--I mean a regular duel with rapiers. He says you gave the  challenge, and so Diamond has the right to name the weapons. Such a  thing can't take place!\"    \"Oh, yes, it can,\" said Frank, coolly. \"Accept the proposition and have  the affair come off as soon as possible.\"    \"But, Frank, think of it! I'll bet Diamond is an expert swordsman, and  he's just the kind of a chap to lose his head and run you through the  body! Why, it would be dimply serrible--I mean simply terrible!\"    \"I'll have to fight him or take water. Now, Harry, old man, you don't  want me to show the white feather, so go back and complete the  arrangements.\"    \"But there ought to be some other way of settling it. If you could  fight him with your fists I know you'd beat him, but you don't stand a  show this way.\"    Frank looked his roommate squarely in the eye.    \"Go back and accept every proposition Ditson makes,\" he commanded, and  Rattleton felt the influence of Merriwell's superior will.    Back he went, and it did not take the seconds long, with Bruce  Browning's aid, to settle matters. Browning said he knew a nice quiet  place where the duel could take place without danger of interruption,  and in a short time the entire party was on the street, following the  lead of the big sophomore.    Harry was at Frank's side and he was greatly agitated.    \"If you are counting on Diamond backing down you'll be dadly--I mean  sadly disappointed,\" he whispered. \"That fellow doesn't know what it is  to be afraid, and he'll stand up to the end.\"    \"Keep cool,\" directed Frank. \"He'll find there are others.\"    Harry gave up in despair.    \"This is a terrible affair!\" he muttered to himself. \"It's likely to  mean arrest, disgrace, imprisonment for the whole of us, if those blamed  hot-headed fools don't kill each other!\"    But he decided to stand by his roommate, no matter what came.    Browning led them away from the vicinity of the college buildings and  down a dark street. At length they came to an old brick structure, in  which not a light was to be seen. Down some slippery stone steps they  went, and the big soph let them in by unlocking a door.    It was dark inside. Browning closed and locked the door, after which he  conducted them along a narrow passage, opened another door, and ushered  them into a room.    The smell of cigarette smoke was strong there, and Frank knew the place  had been lately occupied by smokers.    A match spluttered, and then a lamp was lighted.    \"Get ready for business,\" directed Browning. \"I will bring the rapiers  and another light.\"    Then he vanished beyond a door that opened into another dark room.    Frank looked around and saw a table, upon which were cards and empty  beer bottles. There were chairs and some copies of illustrated sporting  papers. The walls were bare.    It was warm down there, and Frank immediately discarded his coat.    Diamond was about to follow Merriwell's example, when there was a sudden  rush of feet and the room filled in a twinkling with masked youths, who  flung themselves on the astonished freshmen and made all but Frank a  prisoner in a moment.    Frank instantly understood that they had been trapped and he knocked  down four of his assailants before they could bear him to the floor and  overpower him.    His hands were securely bound, and then he was lifted to his feet.    \"Well, fellows, that was a pretty slick trick,\" he half laughed, as he  coolly looked around. \"You sophs have been trying to corral a gang of us  for a week, and with the aid of the smooth Mr. Browning you succeeded  very finely this time.\"    \"Silence!\" roared a deep voice, and a tall fellow in a scarlet Mephisto  rig confronted Frank. \"You have intruded upon forbidden ground. None but  the chosen may enter here and escape with life.\"    \"Not one!\" chorused all the masks in deep and dismal unison.    Mephisto made a signal. Once more the freshmen were seized.    \"Away with them!\" shouted the fellow in red.    In another moment all but Frank had been hustled out of the room. Then  Frank was suddenly held fast and blindfolded. He was dragged along to  some place where the opening of another door brought to his ears the  sound of horns and shouts of fiendish glee. He was made to mount some  stairs and then his feet were kicked from beneath him, and he shot down  a steep and slippery incline into the very midst of the shouting demons.  He dropped through space and landed--in a vat of ice-cold water. Then he  was dragged out, thumped on the head with stuffed clubs, deafened by the  horns that bellowed in his ears, and tossed in a blanket till his head  bumped against the ceiling. Then he was forced to crawl through a piano  box that was filled with sawdust. He was pushed and pulled and hammered  and thumped till he was sore in every part of his body.    All through this ordeal not a word or murmur escaped his lips. His teeth  were set, and he felt that he had rather die than utter a sound that  betrayed pain or agitation.    This seemed to infuriate his assailants. They banged him about till he  could scarcely stand, and then, of a sudden, there was a great hush,  while a terrible voice croaked:    \"Bring forth the guillotine!\"    There was a bustle, and then the bandage was stripped from Frank's eyes,  he was tripped up, and a second later found himself lying helpless with  his neck in the socket of a mock guillotine. Above him was suspended a  huge gleaming knife that seemed to tremble, as if about to fall. At his  side was a fellow dressed in the somber garments of an executioner.    It was really a severe strain upon his nerves, but still his teeth were  clinched, and not a sound came from his lips.    \"The knife is broken,\" whispered the mock executioner in Frank's ear,  \"so it may accidentally fall and cut you.\"    \"Have you any last message, fresh?\" hoarsely whispered the mock  executioner. \"There might be a fatal accident.\"    Frank made no reply save to wink tauntingly at the fellow.    The next instant, with a nerve-breaking swish, the shining blade fell!    A piece of ice was drawn across Frank's throat and a stream of warm  water squirted down his back.    It was most horribly real and awful, and for a moment it seemed that the  knife had actually done the frightful deed.    Despite his wonderful nerve, Frank gasped; but he quickly saw that the  knife had swung"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#2)"],[1,"you step aside,      I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.      Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay      To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,                                       Exeunt [Montague and Wife].      Ben. Good morrow, cousin.      Rom. Is the day so young?      Ben. But new struck nine.      Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.      Was that my father that went hence so fast?      Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?      Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.      Ben. In love?      Rom. Out-      Ben. Of love?      Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.      Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,      Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!      Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,      Should without eyes see pathways to his will!      Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?      Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.      Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.      Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!      O anything, of nothing first create!      O heavy lightness! serious vanity!      Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!      Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!      Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is      This love feel I, that feel no love in this.      Dost thou not laugh?      Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.      Rom. Good heart, at what?      Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.      Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.      Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,      Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest      With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown      Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.      Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;      Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;      Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.      What is it else? A madness most discreet,      A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.      Farewell, my coz.      Ben. Soft! I will go along.      An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.      Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:      This is not Romeo, he's some other where.      Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?      Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?      Ben. Groan? Why, no;      But sadly tell me who.      Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.      Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!      In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.      Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.      Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.      Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.      Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit      With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,      And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,      From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.      She will not stay the siege of loving terms,      Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,      Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.      O, she's rich in beauty; only poor      That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.      Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?      Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;      For beauty, starv'd with her severity,      Cuts beauty off from all posterity.      She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,      To merit bliss by making me despair.      She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow      Do I live dead that live to tell it now.      Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.      Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!      Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.      Examine other beauties.      Rom. 'Tis the way      To call hers (exquisite) in question more.      These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,      Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.      He that is strucken blind cannot forget      The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.      Show me a mistress that is passing fair,      What doth her beauty serve but as a note      Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?      Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.      Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.          Scene II.  A Street.    Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.        Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,      In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,      For men so old as we to keep the peace.      Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,      And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.      But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?      Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:      My child is yet a stranger in the world,      She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;      Let two more summers wither in their pride      Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.      Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.      Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.      The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;      She is the hopeful lady of my earth.      But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;      My will to her consent is but a part.      An she agree, within her scope of choice      Lies my consent and fair according voice.      This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,      Whereto I have invited many a guest,      Such as I love; and you among the store,      One more, most welcome, makes my number more.      At my poor house look to behold this night      Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.      Such comfort as do lusty young men feel      When well apparell'd April on the heel      Of limping Winter treads, even such delight      Among fresh female buds shall you this night      Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,      And like her most whose merit most shall be;      Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,      May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.      Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,      sirrah, trudge about      Through fair Verona; find those persons out      Whose names are written there, and to them say,      My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-                                       Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].      Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written      that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor      with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter      with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are      here writ, and can never find what names the writing person      hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!                       Enter Benvolio and Romeo.        Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;      One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;      Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;      One desperate grief cures with another's languish.      Take thou some new infection to thy eye,      And the rank poison of the old will die.      Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.      Ben. For what, I pray thee?      Rom. For your broken shin.      Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?      Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;      Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,      Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.      Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?      Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.      Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can      you read anything you see?      Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.      Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!      Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.          'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;        County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;        The lady widow of Vitruvio;        Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;        Mercutio and his brother Valentine;        Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;        My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;        Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;        Lucio and the lively Helena.'        [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they      come?      Serv. Up.      Rom. Whither?      Serv. To supper, to our house.      Rom. Whose house?      Serv. My master's.      Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.      Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great      rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray      come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.      Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's      Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;      With all the admired beauties of Verona.      Go thither, and with unattainted eye      Compare her face with some that I shall show,      And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.      Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye      Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;      And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,      Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!      One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun      Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.      Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,      Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;      But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd      Your lady's love against some other maid      That I will show you shining at this feast,      And she shall scant show well that now seems best.      Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,      But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]          Scene III.  Capulet's house.    Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
