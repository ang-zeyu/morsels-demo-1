'Not a chance,' said Pringle complacently, 'you're all right. Don't you  worry yourself.'    Webster's, against whom Leicester's had been drawn in the opening round  of the House matches, had three men in their team, and only three, who  knew how to hold a bat. It was the slackest House in the School, and  always had been. It did not cause any overwhelming surprise,  accordingly, when Leicester's beat them without fatigue by an innings  and a hundred and twenty-one runs. Webster's won the toss, and made  thirty-five. For Leicester's, Reece and Gethryn scored fifty and  sixty-two respectively, and Marriott fifty-three not out. They then,  with two wickets down, declared, and rattled Webster's out for seventy.  The public, which had had its eye on the team, in order to see how its  tail was likely to shape, was disappointed. The only definite fact that  could be gleaned from the match was that the junior members of the team  were not to be despised in the field. The early morning field-outs had  had their effect. Adams especially shone, while Wilson at cover and  Burgess in the deep recalled Jessop and Tyldesley.    The School made a note of the fact. So did the Bishop. He summoned the  eight juniors _seriatim_ to his study, and administered much  praise, coupled with the news that fielding before breakfast would go  on as usual.    Leicester's had drawn against Jephson's in the second round. Norris's  lot had beaten Cooke's by, curiously enough, almost exactly the same  margin as that by which Leicester's had defeated Webster's. It was  generally considered that this match would decide Leicester's chances  for the cup. If they could beat a really hot team like Jephson's, it  was reasonable to suppose that they would do the same to the rest of  the Houses, though the School House would have to be reckoned with. But  the School House, as Pringle had observed, was weak in the field. It  was not a coherent team. Individually its members were good, but they  did not play together as Leicester's did.    But the majority of the School did not think seriously of their  chances. Except for Pringle, who, as has been mentioned before, always  made a point of thinking differently from everyone else, no one really  believed that they would win the cup, or even appear in the final. How  could a team whose tail began at the fall of the second wicket defeat  teams which, like the School House, had no real tail at all?    Norris supported this view. It was for this reason that when, at  breakfast on the day on which Jephson's were due to play Leicester's,  he received an invitation from one of his many uncles to spend a  weekend at his house, he decided to accept it.    This uncle was a man of wealth. After winning two fortunes on the Stock  Exchange and losing them both, he had at length amassed a third, with  which he retired in triumph to the country, leaving Throgmorton Street  to exist as best it could without him. He had bought a 'show-place' at  a village which lay twenty miles by rail to the east of Beckford, and  it had always been Norris's wish to see this show-place, a house which  was said to combine the hoariest of antiquity with a variety of modern  comforts.    Merely to pay a flying visit there would be good. But his uncle held  out an additional attraction. If Norris could catch the one-forty from  Horton, he would arrive just in time to take part in a cricket match,  that day being the day of the annual encounter with the neighbouring  village of Pudford. The rector of Pudford, the opposition captain, so  wrote Norris's uncle, had by underhand means lured down three really  decent players from Oxford--not Blues, but almost--who had come to the  village ostensibly to read classics with him as their coach, but in  reality for the sole purpose of snatching from Little Bindlebury (his  own village) the laurels they had so nobly earned the year before. He  had heard that Norris was captaining the Beckford team this year, and  had an average of thirty-eight point nought three two, so would he come  and make thirty-eight point nought three two for Little Bindlebury?    'This,' thought Norris, 'is Fame. This is where I spread myself. I must  be in this at any price.'    He showed the letter to Baker.    'What a pity,' said Baker.    'What's a pity?'    'That you won't be able to go. It seems rather a catch.'    'Can't go?' said Norris; 'my dear sir, you're talking through your hat.  Think I'm going to refuse an invitation like this? Not if I know it.  I'm going to toddle off to Jephson, get an exeat, and catch that  one-forty. And if I don't paralyse the Pudford bowling, I'll shoot  myself.'    'But the House match! Leicester's! This afternoon!' gurgled the amazed  Baker.    'Oh, hang Leicester's. Surely the rest of you can lick the Kids' Happy  League without my help. If you can't, you ought to be ashamed of  yourselves. I've chosen you a wicket with my own hands, fit to play a  test match on.'    'Of course we ought to lick them. But you can never tell at cricket  what's going to happen. We oughtn't to run any risks when we've got  such a good chance of winning the pot. Why, it's centuries since we won  the pot. Don't you go.'    'I must, man. It's the chance of a lifetime.'    Baker tried another method of attack.    'Besides,' he said, 'you don't suppose Jephson'll let you off to play  in a beastly little village game when there's a House match on?'    'He must never know!' hissed Norris, after the manner of the  Surrey-side villain.    'He's certain to ask why you want to get off so early.'    'I shall tell him my uncle particularly wishes me to come early.'    'Suppose he asks why?'    'I shall say I can't possibly imagine.'    'Oh, well, if you're going to tell lies--'    'Not at all. Merely a diplomatic evasion. I'm not bound to go and sob  out my secrets on Jephson's waistcoat.'    Baker gave up the struggle with a sniff. Norris went to Mr Jephson and  got leave to spend the week-end at his uncle's. The interview went  without a hitch, as Norris had prophesied.    'You will miss the House match, Norris, then?' said Mr Jephson.    'I'm afraid so, sir. But Mr Leicester's are very weak.'    'H'm. Reece, Marriott, and Gethryn are a good beginning.'    'Yes, sir. But they've got nobody else. Their tail starts after those  three.'    'Very well. But it seems a pity.'    'Thank you, sir,' said Norris, wisely refraining from discussing the  matter. He had got his exeat, which was what he had come for.    In all the annals of Pudford and Little Bindlebury cricket there had  never been such a match as that year's. The rector of Pudford and his  three Oxford experts performed prodigies with the bat, prodigies, that  is to say, judged from the standpoint of ordinary Pudford scoring,  where double figures were the exception rather than the rule.    The rector, an elderly, benevolent-looking gentleman, played with  astounding caution and still more remarkable luck for seventeen.  Finally, after he had been in an hour and ten minutes, mid-on accepted  the eighth easy chance offered to him, and the ecclesiastic had to  retire. The three 'Varsity men knocked up a hundred between them, and  the complete total was no less than a hundred and thirty-four.    Then came the sensation of the day. After three wickets had fallen for  ten runs, Norris and the Little Bindlebury curate, an old Cantab,  stayed together and knocked off the deficit.    Norris's contribution of seventy-eight not out was for many a day the  sole topic of conversation over the evening pewter at the 'Little  Bindlebury Arms'. A non-enthusiast, who tried on one occasion to  introduce the topic of Farmer Giles's grey pig, found himself the most  unpopular man in the village.    On the Monday morning Norris returned to Jephson's, with pride in his  heart and a sovereign in his pocket, the latter the gift of his  excellent uncle.    He had had, he freely admitted to himself, a good time. His uncle had  done him well, exceedingly well, and he looked forward to going to the  show-place again in the near future. In the meantime he felt a languid  desire to know how the House match was going on. They must almost have  finished the first innings, he thought--unless Jephson's had run up a  very big score, and kept their opponents in the field all the  afternoon.    'Hullo, Baker,' he said, tramping breezily into the study, 'I've had  the time of a lifetime. Great, simply! No other word for it. How's the  match getting on?'    Baker looked up from the book he was reading.    'What match?' he enquired coldly.    'House match, of course, you lunatic. What match did you think I meant?  How's it going on?'    'It's not going on,' said Baker, 'it's stopped.'    'You needn't be a funny goat,' said Norris complainingly. 'You know  what I mean. What happened on Saturday?'    'They won the toss,' began Baker slowly.    'Yes?'    'And went in and made a hundred and twenty.'    'Good. I told you they were no use. A hundred and twenty's rotten.'    'Then we went in, and made twenty-one.'    'Hundred and twenty-one.'    'No. Just a simple twenty-one without any trimmings of any sort.'    'But, man! How? Why? How on earth did it happen?'    'Gethryn took eight for nine. Does that seem to make it any clearer?'    'Eight for nine? Rot.'    'Show you the score-sheet if you care to see it. In the second  innings--'    'Oh, you began a second innings?'    'Yes. We also finished it. We scored rather freely in the second  innings. Ten was on the board before the fifth wicket fell. In the end  we fairly collared the bowling, and ran up a total of forty-eight.'    Norris took a seat, and tried to grapple with the situation.    'Forty-eight! Look here, Baker, swear you're not ragging.'    Baker took a green scoring-book from the shelf and passed it to him.    'Look for yourself,' he said.    Norris looked. He looked long and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#19)"],[1,"of the stream; the  water would look quite red, would it not? And this is the way in which,  blood looks red--only observe one thing; a grain of sand is a mountain in  comparison with the little red fishes in the blood. If I were to tell you  they measured about 1/3500 of an inch in diameter, you would not be much  wiser; so I prefer saying (by way of giving you a more perfect idea of  their minuteness) that there would be about a million in such a drop of  blood as would hang on the point of a needle. I say so on the authority of  a scientific microscopist--M. Bouillet. Not that he has ever counted  them, as you may suppose, any more than I have done; but this is as near  an approach as can be made by calculation to the size of 1/3500 part of an  inch in diameter.--JEAN MACE.] so small that about three thousand five  hundred placed side by side would measure only an inch, and it would take  sixteen thousand laid flatwise upon one another to make a column of that  height. Under the microscope, they are found to be rounded at the edge and  concave on both sides. [Footnote: By pricking the end of the finger with a  needle, we can obtain a drop for examination. Place it on the slide, cover  with a glass, and put it at once under the microscope. The red disks will  be seen to group themselves in rows, while the white disks will seem to  draw apart, and to be constantly changing their form. After a gradual  evaporation, the crystals (Fig. 36) may be seen. In animals, they have  various, though distinctive forms.] They have a tendency to collect in  piles like rolls of coin. The size and shape vary in the blood of  different animals. [Footnote: Authorities differ greatly in their estimate  of the size of the disks (corpuscles) in human blood. The fact is that the  size varies in different persons, probably also in the same individual.  Many of the best microscopists therefore hesitate to state whether a  particular specimen of blood belonged to a human being or to an animal.  Others claim that they can distinguish with accuracy. Evidently, the  question is one of great uncertainty. The following statement of the size  of the cells in different animals is taken from Gulliver's tables: Cat,  1/4404 of an inch in diameter; whale, 1/3100; mouse, 1/3614; hog, 1/4230;  camel, 1/3123; sheep, 1/3352; horse, 1/4800; Virginia deer, 1/5038; dog-  faced baboon, 1/4861; brown baboon, 1/3493; red monkey, 1/3396; black  monkey, 1/3530.] Disks are continually forming in the blood, and are  constantly dying--twenty million at every breath.--DRAPER.    The plasma also contains fibrin, [Footnote: it is usual to say that fibrin  is contained in the blood. It probably does not exist as such, but there  are present in the blood certain substances known as _paraglobulin_  and _fibrinogen_, which by the action of a third substance, _fibrin  ferment_ under certain circumstances, form fibrin and so cause  coagulation. The exact nature of the process by which fibrin is produced  by these three factors is not understood--See Foster's _Text Book of  Physiology_, p 22.] albumin--which is found nearly pure in the white of  an egg--and various mineral substances, as iron, [Footnote: Enough iron  has been found in the ashes of a burned body to form a mourning ring.]  lime, magnesia, phosphorus, potash, etc.    FIG. 36.    [Illustration: _Blood Crystals_]    USES OF THE BLOOD.--The blood has been called \"liquid flesh\"; but it is  more than that, since it contains the materials for making every organ.  The plasma is rich in mineral matter for the bones, and in albumen for the  muscles. The red disks are the air cells of the blood. They contain the  oxygen so essential to every operation of life. Wherever there is work to  be done or repairs to be made, there the oxygen is needed. It stimulates  to action, and tears down all that is worn out. In this process, it  combines with and actually burns out parts of the muscles and other  tissues, as wood is burned in the stove. [Footnote: For the sake of  simplicity, perhaps to conceal our own ignorance, we call this process  \"burning.\" The simile of a fire is good so far as it goes. But as to the  real nature of the change which the physiologist briefly terms  \"oxidation,\" we know nothing. This much only can be asserted positively. A  stream of oxygen is carried by the blood to the muscles (in fact to every  tissue in the body), while, from the muscles the blood carries away a  stream of carbonic acid and water. But what takes place in the muscles,  when and what chemical change occurs, no one can tell. We see the first  and the last stage. We know that contraction of the muscles somehow comes  about, oxygen disappears, carbonic acid appears, energy is released, and  force is exhibited as motion, heat, and electricity. But the intermediate  step is hidden.    There are certain theories advanced, however, that are worth considering.  Some physiologists hold that the muscle has the power of taking up the  oxygen from the _hemoglobin_ (a body that comprises ninety per cent  of the red corpuscles when dried, and is the oxygen carrier of the blood),  and fixing it, as well as the raw material (food) furnished by the blood,  thus forming a true contractile substance. The breaking down or  decomposition of this contractile substance in the muscle, sets free its  potential energy. The process is gentle so long as the muscle is at rest,  but becomes excessive and violent when contraction occurs. (See \"Foster's  Physiology,\" p. 118.) It is also believed by some that the chemical change  in the muscle partakes of a fermentive character; that, under the  influence of the proper ferments, the substances break up into other and  simpler products, thus setting free heat and force; and that this chemical  change is followed by a secondary oxidation by the oxygen in the arterial  blood, thereby forming carbonic acid and water, as in all putrefactive  processes. But these and other views are not as yet fully understood;  while they utterly fail to tell us how a collection of simple cells,  filled merely with a semifluid mass of matter, can contract and set free  muscular power. The commonness of this act hides from us its wonderful  nature. But here, hidden in the cell--Nature's tiny laboratory--lies the  mystery of life. Before its closed door we ponder in vain, confessing the  unskillfulness of our labor, and fearing all the while lest the _Secret  of the Cell_ will always elude our search.] The blood, now foul with  the burned matter, the refuse of this fire, is caught up by the  circulation, and whirled back to the lungs, where it is purified, and  again sent bounding on its way.    There are then two different kinds of the blood in the body: the red or  arterial, and the dark or venous.    TRANSFUSION.--As the blood is really the \"vital fluid\" it would seem that  feeble persons might be restored to vigor by infusing healthy blood into  their veins. This hypothesis, so valuable in its possible results in  prolonging human life, has been carefully tested. Animals which have  ceased to breathe have thus had their vitality recalled. In the  seventeenth century the theory became a subject of special investigation.  A maniac was restored to reason by the blood of a calf, and the most  extravagant hopes were entertained. But many fatal accidents occurring,  experiments upon human beings were forbidden by law, and transfusion soon  fell into disuse. It has, however, been successfully practiced in several  cases within the last few years, and is a method still in repute for  saving lives.    COAGULATION.--When blood is exposed to the air, it coagulates. This is  caused by the solidifying of the fibrin, which entangling the disks, forms  the \"clot.\" The remaining clear, yellow liquid is the _serum_. The  value of this peculiar property of the blood can hardly be overestimated.  The coagulation soon checks all ordinary cases of bleeding. [Footnote: In  the case of the lower animals, which have no means of stopping hemorrhages  as we have, the coagulation is generally still more rapid. In some species  of birds it takes place almost instantaneously.] When a wound is made, and  bleeding commences, the fibrin forms a temporary plug, as it were, which  is absorbed when the healing process is finished. Thus we see how a Divine  foresight has provided not only for the ordinary wants of the body, but  also for the accidents to which it is liable. [Footnote: The fibrin is not  an essential ingredient of the blood. All the functions of life are  regularly performed in people whose blood lacks fibrin; and, in cases of  transfusion, where blood deprived of its fibrin was used, the vivifying  influence seemed to be the same. Its office, therefore, must mainly be to  stanch any hemorrhage which may occur.--FLINT.]    FIG. 37.    [Illustration: _The Heart._ A, _the right ventricle;_ B, _the  left ventricle;_ C, _the right auricle;_ D, _the left auricle._]    THE HEART is the engine which propels the blood. It is a hollow, pear-  shaped muscle, about the size of the fist. It hangs, point downward, just  to the left of the center of the chest. (See Fig. 31.) It is inclosed in a  loose sac of serous membrane, [Footnote: The mucous membrane lines the  open cavities of the body; the serous, the closed. The pericardium is a  sac composed of two layers--a fibrous membrane on the outside, and a  serous one on the inside. The latter covers the external surface of the  heart, and is reflected back upon itself in order to form, like all the  membranes of this nature, a sac without an opening. The heart is thus  covered by the pericardial sac, but not contained inside its cavity.
