Vol. 1 (of 3) (#19)"],[1," at the time;  while few possessed their generosity, energy, and abstemiousness; they  were a race of gentlemen!\"    \"Yes, abstemiousness has always continued to be a characteristic of  their gentlemanlike descendants,\" sneered Winter.    \"Quite as much as of the all imbibing Saxons. I like the Normans,\"  replied Kate.    \"Was it not here, Miss Vernon, that Geraldine Mowbray mounted guard  with her waiting woman, to give the Warders time for repose?\" enquired  Gilpin.    \"Yes, it was during an insurrection of the Saxon serfs, and was not  unlike the Lady Evelyn Berenger's watch in 'The Betrothed.' She had a  brave heart.\"    \"It is wonderful what heroic acts women were capable of in those days,\"  observed the Colonel.    \"It was the peculiar position they were placed in called forth  faculties which still exist, ready to spring into action whenever there  is a call for self devotion,\" said I.    \"Which are exercised every day, and a thousand times more painfully, in  silent unregarded sacrifices,\" observed the Organist.    \"And a thousand times more gloriously,\" said Miss Vernon. \"It was,  I am sure, comparatively easy to act heroically, when the tone of  every thing round you was heroic; applauded and worshipped by noble  and gallant knights; celebrated by minstrels through all the world of  chivalry. I have not much courage to boast of, but I think I could  mount guard on an emergency, and under those circumstances. Ah! dare I  say I have that loftier courage that would enable me to bear up under  trials, the depth of which, my own heart alone knew!\"    She stopped suddenly, blushing, as if ashamed of her own enthusiasm.    \"My dear Kate, what makes you think such dreadful things?\" whined Mrs.  Winter.    \"Why, Miss Vernon, you are in a moralising vein,\" cried her mate.    \"I have no doubt, Kate, you would lead a forlorn hope gallantly,\" said  her grandfather.    \"Take me as your Lieutenant, Miss Vernon, and trust me I'll support my  chief.\"    \"When the occasion comes, you'll find strength,\" said Gilpin.    \"_Basta! in nome di Dio_, leave off moralising, and give us a song.\"  The Organist and Kate sang a duet, and even Winter joined in a catch;  their notes floated sweetly on the air, and woke up the echoes of the  deserted castle. Tom gathered up the fragments of the feast, and Mr.  Winter hinted it was time for us to start for the farm.    We all accordingly rose, and Gilpin, who was a little of a botanist,  climbed to get some wild plant that caught his eye, a little way up  the remnant of a watchtower I have already mentioned. \"I wonder,\" said  Kate, \"if this is the dangerous part of the ruins; I think that wall  looks tottering;\" and she remained standing beside me, watching the  Organist. As she spoke, I fancied I heard something fall among the  thick leafy boughs at the other side; then one of the stones by which  Gilpin had ascended rolled slowly away. \"_Christo benedetto!_\" shouted  Winter, \"down, down all of you, it will fall.\" They rushed rapidly  away; Kate paused for an instant to say, \"poor Mr. Gilpin, help him,  he is lame.\" I immediately flew to assist his descent, and almost  lifted him to the ground; he turned quickly to the right, down a broken  flight of steps, and I was following him, when there was a crash, a  blinding dust, a scream of dismay from the lookers on; I felt a heavy  blow, a sense of acute pain, and then all was darkness.          CHAPTER VIII.    CONVALESCENCE.      I will not dwell on the wearisome details of a sick room; my escape  from death was almost miraculous, still the injuries I received were  dangerous, and my recovery retarded by the fever consequent on my slow  and painful transit from the scene of the accident to Winter's house,  where he insisted on establishing me, on the plea that he was partly  the cause of my sufferings. Here all that kindness and skill could  accomplish, was done to alleviate them; poor Gilpin watching over me  with the affection of a brother, and the tenderness of woman. Mrs.  O'Toole, too, seemed a fixture by my bedside, and when in the delirium  of fever, no voice had so much influence over me, I was told, as the  rich tones of her mellifluous brogue.    Burton and Colonel Dashwood came over from Carrington, on receiving  despatches announcing the accident, and the former finding me in such  good hands, gave up his intention of remaining with me. Notwithstanding  all the care and watchfulness expended on me, October was well nigh  past before the spectacled, shovel-hatted Galen of A---- pronounced  a visit to the drawing room feasible; and my utter exhaustion, when  the transit from my room was effected, proved the correctness of his  judgment.    There I lay stretched on the sofa, strength and energy alike vanished,  finding a sufficient exercise for all my faculties, in watching the  twinkling of Mrs. Winter's knitting needles, and enjoying a delicious  languor, partly the result of weakness, partly of freedom from pain.  Where was the resolution with which I was to disentangle my affairs,  rouse my brother to a sense of duty, and try my chance of winning Kate  Vernon? Buried in the ruins of the \"Lady's Tower,\" as it was called,  while I was utterly unable to move without assistance, and indebted to  Mrs. Winter's unceasing attention for the conveyance of every spoonful  of jelly that reached my lips, yet in spite of all, I was almost glad  to be thus compelled to postpone for the present my intentions.    It was so delightful to feel that no exertion could be expected from  me, and that I was chained within the magic circle of Kate Vernon's  influence, without the possibility of Burton or any one else caviling  at the cause. Yet such is the miserable vanity of our petty nature, I  rather delayed seeing her, even after the doctor had declared visitors  admissible. The Colonel had from the first seen me almost daily,  and now no morning passed, without a visit from him to tell me the  news--what the troops in India were about; what the _Times_ said of  the Ministry, and of the enquiries made for me by Colonel Dashwood and  my brother officers; in short, I was an occupation to him, and always  welcomed his appearance with a warmth too genuine not to touch his  benevolent heart.    Winter had received one or two notes of inquiry from my brother,  finally a formal letter of thanks for his attention to me, and Egerton  appeared to relapse into his usual forgetfulness of my existence.    My days generally passed in a sort of routine order, each person of our  little society giving me a portion of their time in turn. The Colonel  in the morning, when Winter was out and his wife in the subterranean  regions, devoted to gastronomy; then Gilpin used to look in between  the intervals of his music lessons; after this came a dreary pause,  before Mrs. Winter was sufficiently at liberty to take up her strangely  soothing work, and Winter still in his studio.    I was unequal to the effort of perusing a book, and longed for some one  to read to me, so I generally lay \"chewing the cud of sweet and bitter  fancy\" from one to two o'clock, and curious enough, as my strength  slowly returned, the bitter predominated; my mind seemed to gather  force enough to feel the weight of responsibilities, from which the  weakness it shared with its closely linked associate, the body, had  freed it for a while. Is it not thus that spirits and forms of slighter  make, and less comprehensive faculties manage to cast away sorrows and  sicknesses that would shatter more robust and powerful frames.    Woe to him whose deep and sensitive feelings are not linked with a  nature strong enough to direct and support them. And for those from  whose light-hearted buoyancy, care and regret seem to glance away as if  from polished armour; why should we dare to sneer at their apparent  frivolity? shall not nature which has furnished every living thing with  its own peculiar weapon, provide the spirit with a fitting defence  against the deadly foes that beset it. _Maraviglia_, as Winter would  say, what profound reflections for a Captain of Light Dragoons!    The interval I have described was dragging its dreary length slowly  over one determined wet day, dark and misty, the clouds having  apparently come down to earth in a fit of hysterics; the trees in the  Abbey garden visible from my sofa had a thoroughly drenched saturated  look as if nothing could ever dry them; once or twice the tramp tramp  of a pair of heavy hob-nailed shoes echoed through the square, and the  wearer trudged by in glistening oilskin cap, a sack thrown over his  shoulders, and a shivering dripping dog at his heels; but beyond this  no living creature showed out of shelter. It was too much, I fancied,  even for the most aquatically inclined duck. I felt the want of  companionship deplorably. What could Winter mean by pretending business  with the Dean this morning? If he was at home I would have some one to  speak to, it is too dark to paint.    There was a low knock at the door, and Mrs. O'Toole's broad pleasant  face appeared, beaming on me over a tray which she carried.    \"Ah, Nurse,\" I exclaimed, \"how delighted I am to see you here--shake  hands.\" I got quite affectionate at the idea of a pleasant chat with  Mrs. O'Toole.    \"Och, jewel, now be asy! don't be strivin' to sit up; sure I'll settle  the pillas for ye, before y'd say thrap stick, if you'd have patience.  There now, take a sup of it, I made ye a nice drop of jelly meeself;  sure little Mrs. Winter's a good soul, but I don't like them English  ways of puttin' lard an' suet into their paste instead of the best  ov good buther; faith, ses I to meeself, may be it's glue they'll be  puttin' in the jelly, so I made ye a drop; an' Mrs. Winter ses, mighty  good humoured, 'Walk up, Mrs. O'Toole, in coorse nothin' plaises the  Captin so much as what you make.' Dear knows it's the t'underin' wet  day; an' how are ye, agrah?\"    I may observe _en"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#19)"],[1,"to Beira was completed. Then the line from  Bulawayo to Salisbury was pushed on; this connection has just been  completed, and one can now travel by rail without changing carriage from  Capetown to Beira _viâ_ Bulawayo and Salisbury. Another line is being  constructed through the Wankie coalfields which will cross the  Zambesi near the Victoria Falls. How short a time ago it seems since the  man who had visited the Falls was regarded as a great explorer! Other  branches, too, will shortly open communication to the various  goldfields.    [Illustration: MACHECKIE RAILWAY BRIDGE ON THE SALISBURY LINE,  MASHONALAND RAILWAY]    It is worthy of notice that Rhodesia, though the most remote from the  coast, was the one State in South Africa whose industries were kept  going during the war, so that the conclusion of peace found her ready  for an immediate expansion of her trade. This was due to the wise policy  of the Company. Early in 1900 it was represented to the Administration  that unless communication, which had been interrupted at the  commencement of the war, was soon restored, work could not proceed on  the mines; the native labourers would have to be discharged, and the  mines would have to be closed down. The Administration realised that it  would not only be disastrous to throw so many Europeans and natives out  of work, but that the closing down of the mines would convince the  Matabele that there was truth in the report which the Boer agents were  diligently spreading to the effect that the English were being driven  out of the country, and that the opportunity for rebellion had arrived.  The Administration therefore came to the assistance of the mining  community by making arrangements for the importation of sufficient  necessaries for six months through Beira, at a fixed transport rate of  £25 per ton from Port Elizabeth. The Company found itself about £5 a ton  out of pocket by this arrangement, but great distress was saved. At the  opening of the war the price of grain and meal rose 100 per cent.; but  the Hon. Sir Arthur Lawley, the then Administrator of Matabeleland,  warned the Chamber of Commerce at Bulawayo that if the cost of  necessaries rose too high he would open the Government Stores--in which  a large reserve of supplies had been laid up at the outbreak of the  war--and sell to white men at a reasonable rate. This had the desired  effect for a time, but later on the merchants took an unfair advantage  of the situation, whereupon the Administrator carried out his threat,  and so brought prices sharply down again. The result of this policy was  excellent; the development of the mines proceeded, even if slowly; the  crops were sown and there was a good harvest; the natives remained quiet  and readily paid their hut-tax, which amounted to a larger sum than had  been raised in any previous year.    Considering all the disasters, from the rinderpest down to the Boer War,  that have befallen the country, it is indeed wonderful that so much has  already been done towards the development of the resources of Rhodesia.  There are critics at home who maintain that the country is valueless,  that there are no payable gold reefs in it, else the mines would by this  time have been working at a profit. People in the old days spoke in the  same way of the Rand. Now, it was not until 1897, when the railway  reached Bulawayo, that the real development of the mines commenced, and  since then the country has produced gold to the value of a million and a  quarter sterling, and this with a very limited number of stamps running.  The gold belt extends for about 500 miles. Out of the 114,000 claims  that have been pegged out, only 737 have been worked at all. Some of the  mines have already paid dividends. The future possibilities of these yet  practically untouched goldfields no one can estimate.    It had been naturally expected that so soon as the opening of the  Rhodesian railways lowered the cost of transport rapid progress would be  made in the working of the mines, and critics at home express their  wonder that more has not been done; but the enormous increase in the  cost of local transport due to the rinderpest has cancelled the  advantage gained by the low railway rates from the south. Before the  railway was constructed or the rinderpest appeared, the transport from  Mafeking to Bulawayo, a distance of 500 miles, was ten shillings per 100  lbs. It costs as much as that now to transport mining machinery by  ox-waggon from the Bulawayo railway-yard to a mine only 50 miles  distant; and some of the mines are as far as 200 miles from a railway  station. The branch lines that are being constructed will bring many of  the mines within easy reach of the railway, but no great general  progress can be made throughout Rhodesia until cattle become plentiful  and cheap again. The Chartered Company is taking active steps to restock  the country. The importation of cattle on a large scale, both by the  various companies and by individuals, is now proceeding. Cattle of an  excellent breed, suitable to the climate, are being brought from  Angoniland, and will be crossed with Kerry or Jersey bulls. Importers of  stock intended for breeding purposes can carry them over the Rhodesian  railways at considerably reduced rates. Moreover, the Administration  advances money to farmers on easy terms, on the security of their farms,  to enable them to purchase cattle. With regard to the rinderpest,  inoculation has proved successful, and the Government should be able to  subdue any fresh outbreak by using the serum which is now manufactured  at Kimberley.    Now that peace has come to South Africa, all that Rhodesia wants to  enable her to make rapid progress is cheap transport, which she will  shortly have, and abundant and efficient native labour; for surely the  sore trials of her youth, which she so pluckily endured and survived,  are over at last. The gold is there; the majority of the reefs are  permanent, and to quote from the report of the Chartered Company's  Resident Consulting Engineer:--\"What the future may hold it is  impossible to say, but the most grievous pessimist must surely admit  that the experimental stage has been safely passed, and that Rhodesia  has been proved to be a valuable gold-mining country of which the  possibilities are enormous.\" The recent discovery of valuable coal  deposits will greatly assist the development of the country's resources,  more especially benefiting the gold-mining industry, for the timber is  becoming exhausted in the vicinity of the mines, and the price of wood  fuel is ever advancing. A careful examination of one small section of  the Wankie bed shows that it will yield 1000 tons a day of coal of  excellent quality for the next hundred years. It is too early yet to  discuss the value of the iron, copper, and other ores which exist in  Rhodesia.    To turn to agriculture. There seems to be no production of the temperate  and sub-tropical zones that does not flourish on the favoured,  well-watered soil of Southern Rhodesia. The area under cultivation is  rapidly extending. The one great drawback is the locust. However,  farming pays well despite occasional bad seasons. Here is a story that  exemplifies the tenacity, under disaster, of the Rhodesian settler. In  one year, when the successive locust swarms ate up the land, a certain  farmer sowed his farm with mealies. The locusts devoured the crop:  undiscouraged, he sowed his fields a second time: again he lost his  crop. Yet a third time he sowed, and got his harvest in safely. Despite  the two failures, he now realised a handsome profit. Happily, in the  season of 1898-99 locusts almost entirely disappeared, and apparently  they have never since invaded the country in their former numbers. It is  claimed that this is due to the extensive use of toxine, with which for  the last few years a campaign of extermination has, with apparent  success, been carried on against these scourges of the land. The toxine  has been distributed among the white farmers and the native chiefs, with  instructions for its use, and satisfaction with the results has been  generally expressed. An energetic farmer does well in Rhodesia, and  finds among the mining communities an ever-increasing market for his  produce. At present the principal products are mealies, barley, wheat,  oats, forage, and potatoes, and excellent crops are raised. Market  farming and dairy farming in the vicinity of the towns are industries  that require little capital, and are exceedingly profitable. Boer  tobacco is produced in large quantities, and experiments that have been  tried with American seed have proved the suitability of soil and climate  for the cultivation of the superior qualities of tobacco. Oranges,  peaches, walnuts, apples, bananas, figs, cherries, vines, and other  fruits do very well in Rhodesia. In the yet uncolonised north of this  vast territory wild rubber of high commercial value covers large tracts  of country. The Chartered Company is taking steps to protect the plant  against the destructive native methods of extraction, and to make it a  source of wealth to Rhodesia as well of revenue to itself. In several  districts the cultivation of coffee and tea promises to prove  successful.    [Illustration: THE WANKIE EXPEDITION]    As elsewhere in South Africa, the chief difficulty in the way of the  development of the country is the disinclination of the idle natives to  work on the mines or elsewhere, all the more so now that so many have  been spoilt by the excessive wages paid to them by the military  authorities during the war. The native of Mashonaland, for example,  living in a country blessed with a fruitful soil and splendid climate,  protected by our rule from the raids that used to devastate his lands,  reaping his crops in security, assisted by the Administration in hard  times of rinderpest or locust scourge, is now more than ever loth to "]]]
