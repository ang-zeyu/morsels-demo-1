Arthur doubled up his fist, and made a plunge at her as if he meant to  knock her down; but Elsie sprang behind the tree, and then ran so  fleetly toward the house that he was not able to overtake her until his  passion had had time to cool.    When they reached the house, Arthur replaced the watch on his father's  table, whence he had taken it, and then they all awaited his return  with what courage they might.    \"I say, Wally,\" said Arthur, drawing his little brother aside and  speaking in a low tone, having first sent a cautious glance around to  assure himself that no one else was within hearing; \"I say, what would  you give me for that new riding whip of mine?\"    \"O Arthur! anything I've got,\" exclaimed the little boy eagerly. \"But  you wouldn't give it up, I know, and you're only trying to tease me.\"    \"No, indeed, Wal; I mean to _give_ it to you if you'll only be a good  fellow and do as I tell you.\"    \"What?\" he asked, with intense interest.    \"Tell papa that Jim broke the watch.\"    \"But he _didn't_\" replied the child, opening his eyes wide with  astonishment.    \"Well, what of that, you little goose?\" exclaimed Arthur impatiently;  \"papa doesn't know that.\"    \"But Jim will get punished,\" said Walter, \"and I don't want to tell  such a big story either.\"    \"Very well, sir, then you'll not get the whip; and, besides, if you  don't do as I wish, I'm certain you'll see a ghost one of these nights;  for there's one comes to see me sometimes, and I'll send him right off  to you.\"    \"Oh! _don't_, Arthur, don't; I'd die of fright,\" cried the little boy,  who was very timid, glancing nervously around, as if he expected the  ghost to appear immediately.    \"I tell you I will, though, if you don't do as I say; he'll come this  very night and carry you off, and never bring you back.\"    \"O Arthur! don't let him come, and I'll say anything you want me to,\"  cried the little fellow in great terror.    \"That's a good boy; I knew you would,\" said Arthur, smiling  triumphantly. And turning away from Walter, he next sought out Enna,  and tried his threats and persuasions upon her with even better success.    Elsie had gone directly to her own room, where she sat trembling every  time a footstep approached her door, lest it should be a messenger from  her grandfather. No one came, however, and at last the tea-bell rang,  and on going down she found to her relief that her grandfather and his  wife had not yet returned.    \"You look pale, Elsie,\" said her father, giving her a scrutinizing  glance as she took her seat by his side. \"Are you well?\"    \"Yes, papa, quite well,\" she replied.    He looked at her again a little anxiously, but said no more; and as  soon as the meal was concluded, Elsie hastened away to her own room  again.    It was still early in the evening when Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore  returned--for once, bringing no company with them; and he had not been  many minutes in the house ere he took up his watch, and of course  instantly discovered the injury it had sustained.    His suspicions at once fell upon Arthur, whose character for mischief  was well established; and burning with rage, watch in hand, he repaired  to the drawing-room, which he entered, asking, in tones tremulous with  passion, \"Where is Arthur! Young rascal! this is some of _his_ work,\"  he added, holding up the injured article.    \"My dear, how can you say so? have you any proof?\" asked his wife,  deprecatingly adding in her softest tones, \"my poor boy seems to get  the blame of everything that goes wrong.\"    \"He gets no more than he deserves,\" replied her husband angrily.  \"Arthur! Arthur, I say, where are you?\"    \"He is in the garden, sir, I think. I saw him walking in the shrubbery  a moment since,\" said Mr. Horace Dinsmore.    The father instantly despatched a servant to bring him in; sending a  second in search of the overseer; while a third was ordered to assemble  all the house-servants. \"I will sift this matter to the bottom, and  child or servant, the guilty one shall suffer for it,\" exclaimed the  old gentleman, pacing angrily up and down the room. \"Arthur,\" said he  sternly, as the boy made his appearance, looking somewhat pale and  alarmed, \"how dared you meddle with my watch?\"    \"I didn't, sir; I never touched it,\" he replied boldly, yet avoiding  his father's eye as he uttered the deliberate falsehood.    \"There, my dear, I told you so,\" exclaimed his mother, triumphantly.    \"I don't believe you,\" said his father; \"and if you are guilty, as I  strongly suspect, you had better confess it at once, before I find it  out in some other way.\"    \"I didn't do it, sir. It was Jim, and I can prove it by Walter and  Enna; we all saw it fall from his pocket when he was up in a tree; and  he cried like anything when he found it was broken, and said he didn't  mean to do it any harm; he was only going to wear it a little while,  and then put it back all safe; but now master would be dreadfully  angry, and have him flogged.\"    \"That I will, if it is true,\" exclaimed the old gentleman,  passionately; \"he shall be well whipped and sent out to work on the  plantation. I'll keep no such meddlers about my house.\"    He looked at Enna. \"What do you know of this?\" he asked.    \"It is true, papa, I saw him do it,\" she replied, with a slight blush,  and sending an uneasy glance around the room.    \"Did you see it, too, Walter?\" asked his father.    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the little fellow, in a low, reluctant tone; \"but  please, papa, don't punish him. I'm sure he didn't mean to break it.\"    \"Hold your tongue! he _shall_ be punished as he deserves,\" cried the  old gentleman, furiously. \"Here, sir,\" turning to the overseer, and  pointing to Jim, \"take the fellow out, and give him such a flogging as  he will remember.\"    Elsie was sitting in her own room, trying to learn a lesson for the  next day, but finding great difficulty in fixing her thoughts upon it,  when she was startled by the sudden entrance of Aunt Chloe, who, with  her apron to her eyes, was sobbing violently.    \"O mammy, mammy! what's the matter? has anything happened to you?\"  inquired the little girl, in a tone of great alarm, starting to her  feet, and dropping her book in her haste and fright.    \"Why,\" sobbed Chloe, \"Jim, he's been an' gone an' broke ole master's  watch, an' he's gwine be whipped, an' old Aunt Phoebe she's cryin' fit  to break her ole heart 'bout her boy, kase--\"    Elsie waited to hear no more, but darting out into the hall, and  encountering her father on his way to his room, she rushed up to him,  pale and agitated, and seizing his hand, looked up eagerly into his  face, exclaiming with a burst of tears and sobs, \"O papa, papa! don't,  oh! _don't_ let them whip poor Jim.\"    Mr. Dinsmore's countenance was very grave, almost distressed.    \"I am sorry it is necessary, daughter,\" he said, \"but Jim has done very  wrong, and deserves his punishment, and I cannot interfere.\"    \"Oh! no, papa, he did not, _indeed_ he did not break the watch. I  _know_ he didn't, for I was by and saw it all.\"    \"Is it _possible?_\" said he, in a tone of surprise; \"then tell me who  did do it. It could not have been you, Elsie?\" and he looked  searchingly into her face.    \"Oh! no, papa, I would never have dared to touch it. But please don't  make me tell tales; but I know it wasn't Jim. Oh! _do_ stop them  quickly, before they begin to whip him.\"    \"Aunt Chloe,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, \"go down to my father, and tell him it  is my request that the punishment should be delayed a few moments until  I come down.\"    Then taking Elsie's hand, he led her into her room again, and seating  himself, drew her to his side, saying, with grave decision, \"Now, my  daughter, if you want to save Jim, it will be necessary for you to tell  _all_ you know about this affair.\"    \"I don't like to tell tales, papa,\" pleaded the little girl; \"I think  it so very mean. Is it not enough for me to tell that I know Jim didn't  do it?\"    \"No, Elsie; I have already said that it is _quite necessary_ for you to  tell _all you know_.\"    \"O papa! don't make me; I don't like to do it,\" she urged, with tears  in her eyes.    \"I should be very much ashamed of you, and quite unwilling to own you  as my child, if under any other circumstances you were willing to tell  tales,\" he replied, in a tone of kindness that quite surprised Elsie,  who always trembled at the very thought of opposing the slightest  resistance to his will; \"but,\" he added, firmly, \"it is the only way to  save Jim; if you do not now make a full disclosure of all you know, he  will be severely whipped and sent away to work on the plantation, which  will distress his poor old mother exceedingly. Elsie, I think you would  be doing very wickedly to allow an innocent person to suffer when you  can prevent it; and besides, I will add the weight of my authority, and  say you _must do it at once_; and you well know, my daughter, that  there can be no question as to the duty of obedience to your father.\"    He paused, gazing earnestly down into the little tearful, downcast,  blushing face at his side.    \"Have I not said enough to convince you of your duty?\" he asked.    \"Yes, papa; I will tell you all about it,\" she answered in a tremulous  tone.    Her story was told with evident reluctance, but in a simple,  straightforward manner, that attested its truthfulness.    Mr. Dinsmore listened in silence, but with an expression of indignation  on his handsome features; and the moment she had finished he rose, and  again taking her hand, led her from the room, saying, as he did so:    \"You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#19)"],[1," and he, as well as all other members of his clan, whether  male or female, could marry only persons of an inferior clan. To this  day mutilation of the person among some tribes of Indians is usual.  The sacrifice of the favorite horse or horses is by no means peculiar  to our Indians, for it was common among the Romans, and possibly even  among the men of the Reindeer period, for at Solutre, in France, the  writer saw horses' bones exhumed from the graves examined in 1873. The  writer has frequently conversed with Indians upon this subject, and  they have invariably informed him that when horses were slain great  care was taken to select the poorest of the band.    Tree-burial was not uncommon among the nations of antiquity, for the  Colchiens enveloped their dead in sacks of skin and hung them to  trees; the ancient Tartars and Scythians did the same. With regard to  the use of scaffolds and trees as places of deposit for the dead, it  seems somewhat curious that the tribes who formerly occupied the  eastern portion of our continent were not in the habit of burying in  this way, which, from the abundance of timber, would have been a much  easier method than the ones in vogue, while the western tribes, living  in sparsely wooded localities, preferred the other. If we consider  that the Indians were desirous of preserving their dead as long as  possible, the fact of their dead being placed in trees and scaffolds  would lead to the supposition that those living on the plains were  well aware of the desiccating property of the dry air of that arid  region. This desiccation would pass for a kind of mummification.    The particular part of the mourning ceremonies, which consisted in  loud cries and lamentations, may have had in early periods of time a  greater significance than that of a mere expression of grief or woe,  and on this point Bruhier [Footnote: L' des signes de la Mort, 1742,  I, p. 475 _et seq._] seems quite positive, his interpretation  being that such cries were intended to prevent premature burial. He  gives some interesting examples, which may be admitted here.    \"The Caribs lament loudly, their wailings being interspersed with  comical remarks and questions to the dead as to why he preferred to  leave this world, having everything to make life comfortable. They  place the corpse on a little seat in a ditch or grave four or five  feet deep, and for ten days they bring food, requesting the corpse to  eat. Finally, being convinced that the dead will neither eat nor  return to life, they throw the food on the head of the corpse and fill  up the grave.\"    When one died among the Romans, the nearest parents embraced the body,  closed the eyes and mouth, and when one was about to die received the  last words and sighs, and then loudly called the name of the dead,  finally bidding an eternal adieu. This ceremony of calling the  deceased by name was known as the _conclamation,_ and was a  custom anterior even to the foundation of Rome. One dying away from  home was immediately removed thither, in order that this might be  performed with greater propriety. In Picardy, as late as 1743, the  relatives threw themselves on the corpse and with loud cries called it  by name, and up to 1855 the Moravians of Pennsylvania, at the death of  one of their number, performed mournful musical airs on brass  instruments from the village church steeple and again at the grave  [Footnote: The writer is informed by Mr. John Henry Boner that this  custom still prevails not only in Pennsylvania, but at the Moravian  settlement of Salem, North Carolina.] This custom, however, was  probably a remnant of the ancient funeral observances, and not to  prevent premature burial, or, perhaps, to scare away bad spirits.    W. L. Hardisty [Footnote: Rep. Smithsonian Inst., 1866, p. 319] gives  a curious example of log-burial in trees, relating to the Loucheux of  British America:    \"They inclose the body in a neatly-hollowed piece of wood, and secure  it to two or more trees, about six feet from the ground. A log about  eight feet long is first split in two, and each of the parts carefully  hollowed out to the required size. The body is then inclosed and the  two pieces well lashed together, preparatory to being finally secured,  as before stated, to the trees\"    With regard to the use of scaffolds as places of deposit for the dead,  the following theories by Dr. W. Gardner, U.S.A., are given:    \"If we come to inquire why the American aborigines placed the dead  bodies of their relatives and friends in trees, or upon scaffolds  resembling trees, instead of burying them in the ground, or burning  them and preserving their ashes in urns, I think we can answer the  inquiry by recollecting that most if not all the tribes of American  Indians, as well as other nations of a higher civilization, believed  that the human soul, spirit or immortal part, was of the form and  nature of a bird, and as these are essentially arboreal in their  habits, it is quite in keeping to suppose that the _soul-bird_  would have readier access to its former home or dwelling-place if it  was placed upon a tree or scaffold than if it was buried in the earth;  moreover, from this lofty eyrie the souls of the dead could rest  secure from the attacks of wolves or other profane beasts, and guard  like sentinels the homes and hunting-grounds of their loved ones.\"    This statement is given because of a corroborative note in the  writer's possession, but he is not prepared to admit it as correct  without farther investigation.        PARTIAL SCAFFOLD BURIAL AND OSSUARIES      Under this heading may be placed the burials which consisted in first  depositing the bodies on scaffolds, where they were allowed to remain  for a variable length of time, after which the bones were cleaned and  deposited either in the earth or in special structures called by  writers \"bone-houses.\" Roman [Footnote: Hist. of Florida, 1775, p.  89.] relates the following concerning the Choctaws:    \"The following treatment of the dead is very strange ... As soon as  the deceased is departed, a stage is erected (as in the annexed plate  is represented) and the corpse is laid on it and covered with a bear  skin; if he be a man of note, it is decorated, and the poles painted  red with vermillion and bear's oil; if a child, it is put upon stakes  set across; at this stage the relations come and weep, asking many  questions of the corpse, such as, why he left them? did not his wife  serve him well? was he not contented with his children? had he not  corn enough? did not his land produce sufficient of everything? was he  afraid of his enemies? etc. and this accompanied by loud howlings; the  women will be there constantly, and sometimes with the corrupted air  and heat of the sun faint so as to oblige the bystanders to carry them  home; the men will also come and mourn in the same manner, but in the  night or at other unseasonable times, when they are least likely to be  discovered.    \"The stage is fenced round with poles; it remains thus a certain time  but not a fixed space; this is sometimes extended to three or four  months, but seldom more than half that time. A certain set of  venerable old Gentlemen who wear very long nails as a distinguishing  badge on the thumb, fore and middle finger of each hand, constantly  travel through the nation (when i was there, i was told there were but  five of this respectable order) that one of them may acquaint those  concerned, of the expiration of this period, which is according to  their own fancy; the day being come, the friends and relations  assemble near the stage, a fire is made, and the respectable operator,  after the body is taken down, with his nails tears the remaining flesh  off the bones, and throws it with the entrails into the fire, where it  is consumed; then he scrapes the bones and burns the scrapings  likewise; the head being painted red with vermillion is with the rest  of the bones put into a neatly made chest (which for a Chief is also  made red) and deposited in the loft of a hut built for that purpose,  and called bone house; each town has one of these; after remaining  here one year or thereabouts, if he be a man of any note, they take  the chest down, and in an assembly of relations and friends they weep  once more over him, refresh the colour of the head, paint the box, and  then deposit him to lasting oblivion.    \"An enemy nor one who commits suicide is buried under the earth as one  to be directly forgotten and unworthy the above ceremonial obsequies  and mourning.\"    Jones [Footnote: Antiquities of the Southern Indiana, 1873, p. 105.]  quotes one of the older writers, as follows, regarding the  _Natchez_ tribe:    \"Among the Natchez the dead were either inhumed or placed in tombs.  These tombs were located within or very near their temples. They  rested upon four forked sticks fixed fast in the ground, and were  raised some three feet above the earth. About eight feet long and a  foot and a half wide, they were prepared for the reception of a single  corpse. After the body was placed upon it, a basket-work of twigs was  woven around and covered with mud, an opening being left at the head,  through which food was presented to the deceased. When the flesh had  all rotted away, the bones were taken out, placed in a box made of  canes, and then deposited in the temple. The common dead were mourned  and lamented for a period of three days. Those who fell in battle were  honored with a more protracted and grievous lamentation.\"    Bartram [Footnote: Bartram's Travel, 1791, p. 516.] gives a somewhat  different account from Roman of burial among the Choctaws of Carolina:    \"The Choctaws pay their last duties and respect to the deceased in a  very different manner. As soon as a person is dead, they erect a  scaffold 18 or 20 feet high in a grove adjacent to the town, where  they lay the corps, lightly covered with a mantle; here it"]]]
