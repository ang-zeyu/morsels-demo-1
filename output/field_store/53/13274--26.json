Her door opened a crack and Arna peeped in, and seeing  her awake, came to the bed and kissed her good morning.    \"I'm so sorry, little sister!\" she said.    \"Sorry for what?\" asked the wondering Peggy.    \"Because I didn't see,\" said Arna. \"But now I'm going to bring up your  breakfast.\"    \"Oh, no!\" cried Peggy, sitting up.    \"Oh, yes!\" said Arna, with quiet authority. It was as dainty cooking as  Peggy's own, and Arna sat by to watch her eat.    \"You're so good to me, Arna!\" said Peggy.    \"Not very,\" answered Arna, dryly. \"When you've finished this you must  lie up here away from the children and read.\"    \"But who will take care of Minna?\" questioned Peggy.    \"Minna's mamma,\" answered a voice from the next room, where Mabel was  pounding pillows. She came to the door to look in on Peggy in all her  luxury of orange marmalade to eat, Christmas books to read, and Arna to  wait upon her.    \"I think mothers, not aunts, were meant to look after babies,\" said  Mabel. \"I'm so sorry, dear!\"    \"Oh, I wish you two wouldn't talk like that!\" cried Peggy. \"I'm so  ashamed.\"    \"All right, we'll stop talking,\" said Mabel quickly, \"but we'll  remember.\"    They would not let Peggy lift her hand to any of the work that day.  Mabel managed the babies masterfully. Arna moved quietly about,  accomplishing wonders.    \"But aren't you tired, Arna?\" queried Peggy.    \"Not a bit of it, and I'll have time to help you with your Caesar  before--\"    \"Before what?\" asked Peggy, but got no answer. They had been translating  famously, when, in the late afternoon, there came a ring of the  doorbell. Peggy found Hazen bowing low, and craving \"Mistress Peggy's  company.\" A sleigh and two prancing horses stood at the gate.    It was a glorious drive. Peggy's eyes danced and her laugh rang out at  Hazen's drolleries. The world stretched white all about them, and their  horses flew on and on like the wind. They rode till dark, then turned  back to the village, twinkling with lights.    The Brower house was alight in every window, and there was the sound  of many voices in the hall. The door flew open upon a laughing crowd of  boys and girls. Peggy, all glowing and rosy with the wind, stood utterly  bewildered until Esther rushed forward and hugged and shook her.    \"It's a party!\" she exclaimed. \"One of your mother's waffle suppers!  We're all here! Isn't it splendid?\"    \"But, but, but--\" stammered Peggy.    \"'But, but, but,'\" mimicked Esther. \"But this is your vacation, don't  you see?\"          XV. LITTLE WOLFF'S WOODEN SHOES    A CHRISTMAS STORY BY FRANCOIS COPPEE; ADAPTED AND TRANSLATED BY ALMA J.  FOSTER    Once upon a time--so long ago that everybody has forgotten the date--in  a city in the north of Europe--with such a hard name that nobody can  ever remember it--there was a little seven-year-old boy named Wolff,  whose parents were dead, who lived with a cross and stingy old aunt, who  never thought of kissing him more than once a year and who sighed deeply  whenever she gave him a bowlful of soup.    But the poor little fellow had such a sweet nature that in spite of  everything, he loved the old woman, although he was terribly afraid of  her and could never look at her ugly old face without shivering.    As this aunt of little Wolff was known to have a house of her own and an  old woollen stocking full of gold, she had not dared to send the boy to  a charity school; but, in order to get a reduction in the price, she had  so wrangled with the master of the school, to which little Wolff finally  went, that this bad man, vexed at having a pupil so poorly dressed and  paying so little, often punished him unjustly, and even prejudiced  his companions against him, so that the three boys, all sons of rich  parents, made a drudge and laughing stock of the little fellow.    The poor little one was thus as wretched as a child could be and used to  hide himself in corners to weep whenever Christmas time came.    It was the schoolmaster's custom to take all his pupils to the midnight  mass on Christmas Eve, and to bring them home again afterward.    Now, as the winter this year was very bitter, and as heavy snow had  been falling for several days, all the boys came well bundled up in warm  clothes, with fur caps pulled over their ears, padded jackets, gloves  and knitted mittens, and strong, thick-soled boots. Only little Wolff  presented himself shivering in the poor clothes he used to wear both  weekdays and Sundays and having on his feet only thin socks in heavy  wooden shoes.    His naughty companions noticing his sad face and awkward appearance,  made many jokes at his expense; but the little fellow was so busy  blowing on his fingers, and was suffering so much with chilblains, that  he took no notice of them. So the band of youngsters, walking two and  two behind the master, started for the church.    It was pleasant in the church which was brilliant with lighted candles;  and the boys excited by the warmth took advantage of the music of the  choir and the organ to chatter among themselves in low tones. They  bragged about the fun that was awaiting them at home. The mayor's son  had seen, just before starting off, an immense goose ready stuffed and  dressed for cooking. At the alderman's home there was a little pine-tree  with branches laden down with oranges, sweets, and toys. And the  lawyer's cook had put on her cap with such care as she never thought of  taking unless she was expecting something very good!    Then they talked, too, of all that the Christ-Child was going to bring  them, of all he was going to put in their shoes which, you might be  sure, they would take good care to leave in the chimney place before  going to bed; and the eyes of these little urchins, as lively as a cage  of mice, were sparkling in advance over the joy they would have when  they awoke in the morning and saw the pink bag full of sugar-plums, the  little lead soldiers ranged in companies in their boxes, the menageries  smelling of varnished wood, and the magnificent jumping-jacks in purple  and tinsel.    Alas! Little Wolff knew by experience that his old miser of an aunt  would send him to bed supperless, but, with childlike faith and certain  of having been, all the year, as good and industrious as possible,  he hoped that the Christ-Child would not forget him, and so he, too,  planned to place his wooden shoes in good time in the fireplace.    Midnight mass over, the worshippers departed, eager for their fun,  and the band of pupils always walking two and two, and following the  teacher, left the church.    Now, in the porch and seated on a stone bench set in the niche of a  painted arch, a child was sleeping--a child in a white woollen garment,  but with his little feet bare, in spite of the cold. He was not a  beggar, for his garment was white and new, and near him on the floor was  a bundle of carpenter's tools.    In the clear light of the stars, his face, with its closed eyes, shone  with an expression of divine sweetness, and his long, curling, blond  locks seemed to form a halo about his brow. But his little child's feet,  made blue by the cold of this bitter December night, were pitiful to  see!    The boys so well clothed for the winter weather passed by quite  indifferent to the unknown child; several of them, sons of the notables  of the town, however, cast on the vagabond looks in which could be read  all the scorn of the rich for the poor, of the well-fed for the hungry.    But little Wolff, coming last out of the church, stopped, deeply  touched, before the beautiful sleeping child.    \"Oh, dear!\" said the little fellow to himself, \"this is frightful! This  poor little one has no shoes and stockings in this bad weather--and,  what is still worse, he has not even a wooden shoe to leave near him  to-night while he sleeps, into which the little Christ-Child can put  something good to soothe his misery.\"    And carried away by his loving heart, Wolff drew the wooden shoe from  his right foot, laid it down before the sleeping child, and, as best  he could, sometimes hopping, sometimes limping with his sock wet by the  snow, he went home to his aunt.    \"Look at the good-for-nothing!\" cried the old woman, full of wrath at  the sight of the shoeless boy. \"What have you done with your shoe, you  little villain?\"    Little Wolff did not know how to lie, so, although trembling with terror  when he saw the rage of the old shrew, he tried to relate his adventure.    But the miserly old creature only burst into a frightful fit of  laughter.    \"Aha! So my young gentleman strips himself for the beggars. Aha! My  young gentleman breaks his pair of shoes for a bare-foot! Here is  something new, forsooth. Very well, since it is this way, I shall put  the only shoe that is left into the chimney-place, and I'll answer for  it that the Christ-Child will put in something to-night to beat you  with in the morning! And you will have only a crust of bread and water  to-morrow. And we shall see if the next time, you will be giving your  shoes to the first vagabond that happens along.\"    And the wicked woman having boxed the ears of the poor little fellow,  made him climb up into the loft where he had his wretched cubbyhole.    Desolate, the child went to bed in the dark and soon fell asleep, but  his pillow was wet with tears.    But behold! the next morning when the old woman, awakened early by the  cold, went downstairs--oh, wonder of wonders--she saw the big chimney  filled with shining toys, bags of magnificent bonbons, and riches of  every sort, and standing out in front of all this treasure, was the  right wooden shoe which the boy had given to the little vagabond, yes,  and beside it, the one which she had placed in the chimney to hold the  bunch of switches.    As little Wolff, attracted by the cries of his aunt, stood in an ecstasy  of childish delight before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#19)"],[1,"flight speed that wasn't too much  under the speed of a single seater fighter plane. Yes, it might be  close, but an Albacore was their best bet. So they had picked the one  they would rush for just as soon as Serrangi's men created the planned  \"disturbance\" on the far side of the field.    But it was the body tingling waiting that dragged you down. It was like  rats inside of you gnawing and gnawing at your nerves until you had to  sink your teeth deep into your lips to stop from screaming and mentally  flying apart in small pieces. Waiting! Waiting for what? A chance to  rush out across the night shadowed drome, and smack into the withering  fire of British guards? To steal a plane and race madly up into the  night sky ... and be caught by British planes and sent hurtling  earthward a ball of raging fire? To reach Raja and turn over the  secret code data, and then stand by helpless as a gigantic, treacherous  blow by the Nazi backed Japanese was struck at England in the Far East?  To....    Dave shook his head savagely to blast the taunting thoughts from his  brain. Many, many times in the past had he and Freddy tackled a problem  that seemed hopeless, but never anything so seemingly utterly hopeless  as this. It wasn't a case of just ferreting out the enemy's secret,  and then smashing him. On the contrary, it was actually the direct  opposite. Freddy and he were going to _give the enemy what he needed_,  and then attempt to smash him _before he could make use of it_! Pure  and simple, it was no more than handing a killer a loaded gun, and then  taking it away from him before he could shoot you between the eyes. It  was crazy, it was ridiculous, it was absurd, and it was insane. Yet it  was the only thing they could do. They had to play it this way. There  was no other loophole, and no chance to dive through it if one should  suddenly present itself. It....    The rest of Dave's whirling thoughts spun off into oblivion as gun fire  and wild shouting suddenly broke out on the far side of the field. It  was like high voltage cutting through both of them, and they came  up on their toes and fingertips as one man. For a brief instant they  poised motionless eyes fixed on the tongue of flame that suddenly shot  up from some building way over beyond the hangars. Then a silent signal  passed between them and they went tearing bent well over out across one  corner of the field toward the nearest Fairey Albacore some seventy  yards away.    Seventy yards? It seemed seventy miles to Dave as he and Freddy Farmer  fairly flew over the ground like a couple of frightened deer. With  each racing step he took he half expected to see a British soldier  rise right up out of the ground and level a rifle at him. No British  soldier appeared, however, and hope zoomed in Dave as he saw the tarmac  guards start running in the direction of the shouts, the shots, and the  flames. The thought of death was not something that held him in fear  and trembling. But to be mowed down by one of your own kind was a death  no man would desire, if death it must be.    Seventy yards, thirty yards, ten yards, one yard! And then Dave and  Freddy virtually vaulted into the pit of the Albacore. No plans had  been made by them in advance about who would take what seat. It just  happened to work out that Dave popped into the pilot's seat, and  Freddy Farmer popped into the navigator-gunner's seat in back. Heart  jammed up hard against his back teeth, and nervous sweat pouring  off his body in rivers, Dave's fingers flew over the gas cocks, and  starter, and ignition switches on the instrument panel. At the same  time ... it was as though he had twenty hands instead of two ... he  fastened the harness buckles of the seat parachute pack, hooked the  safety belt clamp, opened up the throttle, and booted off the wheel  brakes. The last operation was to jab the starter button ... and pray  as he had never before prayed in all of his young years!    An eternity of heart crushing agony was Dave's, and then the Bristol  Taurus in the nose roared up in its full throated song of power. The  Albacore trembled and quivered for a brief instant and then shot  forward as though ropes holding it back had been slashed through.  Braced for the shock, Dave bent more forward over the stick and grimly  waited for the craft to pick up sufficient take-off speed. With every  revolution of the three-bladed steel propeller the plane tore faster  and faster across the hard sun baked surface of the Base field. A  thousand and one weird, crazy images seemed to pop up out of the ground  just in front of the thundering plane. Dave's imagination went on a  holiday during those few awful moments. He saw squads of British India  troops loom up and blast away at the plane with rifle and machine gun  fire, he saw armored cars rushing toward him from all angles, with guns  blazing, and he saw a half division of tanks move like lightning into  position to bar his way. He saw everything that an excitement quivering  brain could conjure up. But all the plane actually crashed into was the  air of night faintly tinted by the glow of the flames somewhere in back  of the hangars.    And then the wheels lifted and Dave sent the Albacore curving up and  around in the night sky. As he held the craft at its maximum climbing  angle he twisted around in the seat and shot a quick glance down at the  R.A.F. Base. Lights had sprung up all over the place, and he could just  barely see the figures running toward the lines of planes. Some quarter  of a mile in back of the row of hangars red flames were gutting an  equipment stores building. The thing, however, that made Dave's heart  slide down to its normal position in his chest was the utter absence  of gun fire spitting up toward them. They had caught the field guards  flat footed, and they would be well out of sight before British single  seaters could come tearing up after them.    Taking his gaze off the scene below, Dave twisted all the way around  and looked back at Freddy. In the pale light of the cockpit bulb the  English youth's face was tense and set. And there was just a faint  sadness in the eyes that stared down at the R.A.F. Base falling away  from the Albacore's belly at a fast rate of speed.    \"What's the matter, pal?\" Dave called out. \"Sad they didn't pepper away  at us?\"    \"Don't talk rot!\" Freddy snappily flinging him a scornful glance. \"I'm  jolly well tickled pink they didn't. I was just thinking that the Japs  must never get Singapore, Dave. It means a lot to England, Singapore  does. Like Gibraltar, and Malta.\"    \"Oh, so that's all that's worrying you, huh?\" Dave echoed. \"I thought  it was something serious. Well, go on back to sleep. I'll take care of  everything for you, see?\"    \"That's splendid!\" Freddy cracked and nodded downward. \"As a starter,  then, you can climb us a little faster. A couple of planes down there  are taking off. And from here they look like Hawker Hurricanes!\"    \"Huh?\" Dave yelled and shoved his head over the side. \"My gosh, that's  right. Hang on! I'm going to stick this baby right on her tail and go  right up the pole!\"    \"Do that, and shut up!\" Freddy said as the Bristol Taurus roared out in  maximum power.    Holding the plane up as steeply as possible and toward the south  Dave gave it his undivided attention until top service ceiling had  been reached and the Island of Singapore was just another one of the  blurred shadows thousands and thousands of feet below his wings. At  top ceiling he leveled off and took a suck now and then on the oxygen  tube he had stuck in his mouth to prevent sudden blacking out. Then on  sudden impulse he killed the Albacore's engine and glided southward at  a very flat angle while he spent the next five minutes scrutinizing the  limitless expanse of night air behind and below. At the end of five  minutes he started the engine again and heaved a little sigh of relief.  They were clear of Singapore, and had succeeded in shaking off the two  R.A.F. planes sent up to intercept them. Now, all that remained was  to fly south for a spell, then double back up the middle of the South  China Sea toward the southern tip of French Indo-China, and so on.    \"Simple, in the bag!\" Dave suddenly grated savagely as reaction set in.  \"All we have to do is the impossible. It should be a cinch!\"    \"What did you say, Dave?\" came Freddy's voice.    \"I said, I hope it'll be a nice day for something!\" Dave grunted and  shrugged his shoulders. \"And do I _hope_!\"          CHAPTER THIRTEEN    _Blue Water Rattlesnake_      Without warning the dawn sun came flaming up over the eastern lip of  the wall, and as though the gods had thrown up millions and millions  of invisible blinds, the shadows of night fled away into eternity and  all was bathed in flashing gold light. For some time now, the Bristol  powered Fairey Albacore had been prop clawing northward high above the  endless rolling blue swells of the South China Sea. With the coming  of the sun there had been a few seconds of wonder and nerve tingling  strain for both Freddy and Dave. Although Freddy had plugged the radio  into the Singapore wave length, and heard searching aircraft report  they had lost all contact with the \"stolen\" plane, there was always the  possibility that the \"thieves\" might find a flight or two of British  aircraft right smack-dab in front of them when the new sun drove the  night westward and out of sight.    However, as luck would have it, the exploding dawn light had found them  completely alone in that section of the world's heavens. Both of them  spent minutes staring hard in all directions. But there was nothing to  see but the brassy blue sky above, and the brassy blue water below.  Breathing a silent prayer in thanks of that small kindness, Dave turned  around to Freddy.    \"What's our position, Navigator?\" he asked. \"My rough figuring of wind,  speed, and direction puts us almost within sight of land.
