The task is not so  difficult in Muhammed's case as in that of others who have founded  religious systems: we have records of his philosophical views,  important even though fragmentary, while vivid descriptions of his  experiences have been transmitted to us in his own words, which have  escaped the modifying influence of tradition at second hand. Muhammed  had an indefinite idea of the word of God as known to him from other  religions. He was unable to realise this idea effectively except as an  immediate revelation; hence throughout the Qoran he represents God as  speaking in the first person and himself appears as the interlocutor.  Even direct commands to the congregation are introduced by the  stereotyped \"speak\"; it was of primary importance that the Qoran  should be regarded as God's word and not as man's. This fact largely  contributed to secure an uncontaminated transmission of the text,  which seems also to have been left by Muhammed himself in definite  form. Its intentional obscurity of expression does not facilitate the  task of the inquirer, but it provides, none the less, considerable  information concerning the religious progress of its author. Here we  are upon firmer ground than when we attempt to describe Muhammed's  outward life, the first half of which is wrapped in obscurity no less  profound than that which veils the youth of the Founder of  Christianity.    Muhammed's contemporaries lived amid religious indifference. The  majority of the Arabs were heathen and their religious aspirations  were satisfied by local cults of the Old Semitic character. They may  have preserved the religious institutions of the great South Arabian  civilisation, which was then in a state of decadence; the beginnings  of Islam may also have been influenced by the ideas of this  civilisation, which research is only now revealing to us: but these  points must remain undecided for the time being. South Arabian  civilisation was certainly not confined to the South, nor could an  organised township such as Mecca remain outside its sphere of  influence: but the scanty information which has reached us concerning  the religious life of the Arabs anterior to Islam might also be  explained by supposing them to have followed a similar course of  development. In any case, it is advisable to reserve judgment until  documentary proof can replace ingenious conjecture. The difficulty of  the problem is increased by the fact that Jewish and especially  Christian ideas penetrated from the South and that their influence  cannot be estimated. The important point for us to consider is the  existence of Christianity in Southern Arabia before the Muhammedan  period. Nor was the South its only starting-point: Christian doctrine  came to Arabia from the North, from Syria and Babylonia, and numerous  conversions, for the most part of whole tribes, were made. On the  frontiers also Arabian merchants came into continual contact with  Christianity and foreign merchants of the Christian faith could be  found throughout Arabia. But for the Arabian migration and the  simultaneous foundation of a new Arabian religion, there is no doubt  that the whole peninsula would have been speedily converted to  Christianity.    The chief rival of Christianity was Judaism, which was represented in  Northern as in Southern Arabia by strong colonies of Jews, who made  proselytes, although their strict ritualism was uncongenial to the  Arab temperament which preferred conversion to Christianity (naturally  only as a matter of form). In addition to Jewish, Christian, and Old  Semitic influences, Zoroastrian ideas and customs were also known in  Arabia, as is likely enough in view of the proximity of the Persian  empire.    These various elements aroused in Muhammed's mind a vague idea of  religion. His experience was that of the eighteenth-century  theologians who suddenly observed that Christianity was but one of  many very similar and intelligible religions, and thus inevitably  conceived the idea of a pure and natural religious system fundamental  to all others. Judaism and Christianity were the only religions which  forced themselves upon Muhammed's consciousness and with the general  characteristics of which he was acquainted. He never read any part of  the Old or New Testament: his references to Christianity show that his  knowledge of the Bible was derived from hearsay and that his  informants were not representative of the great religious sects:  Muhammed's account of Jesus and His work, as given in the Qoran, is  based upon the apocryphal accretions which grew round the Christian  doctrine.    When Muhammed proceeded to compare the great religions of the Old and  New Testaments with the superficial pietism of his own compatriots, he  was especially impressed with the seriousness of the Hebrews and  Christians which contrasted strongly with the indifference of the  heathen Arabs. The Arab was familiar with the conception of an  almighty God, and this idea had not been obscured by the worship of  trees, stones, fire and the heavenly bodies: but his reverence for  this God was somewhat impersonal and he felt no instinct to approach  Him, unless he had some hopes or fears to satisfy. The idea of a  reckoning between man and God was alien to the Arab mind. Christian  and Jewish influence became operative upon Muhammed with reference  to this special point. The idea of the day of judgment, when an  account of earthly deeds and misdeeds will be required, when the joys  of Paradise will be opened to the good and the bad will be cast into  the fiery abyss, such was the great idea, which suddenly filled  Muhammed's mind and dispelled the indifference begotten of routine and  stirred his mental powers.    Polytheism was incompatible with the idea of God as a judge supreme  and righteous, but yet merciful. Thus monotheism was indissolubly  connected with Muhammed's first religious impulses, though the dogma  had not assumed the polemical form in which it afterwards confronted  the old Arabian and Christian beliefs. But a mind stirred by religious  emotion only rose to the height of prophetic power after a long course  of development which human knowledge can but dimly surmise.  Christianity and Judaism had their sacred books which the founders of  these religions had produced. In them were the words of God,  transmitted through Moses to the Jews and through Jesus to the  Christians. Jesus and Moses had been God's ambassadors to their  peoples. Who then could bring to the Arabs the glad tidings which  should guide them to the happy fields of Paradise? Among primitive  peoples God is regarded as very near to man. The Arabs had, their  fortune-tellers and augurs who cast lots before God and explained His  will in mysterious rhythmical utterances. Muhammed was at first more  intimately connected with this class of Arab fortune-tellers than is  usually supposed. The best proof of the fact is the vehemence with  which he repudiates all comparison between these fortune-tellers and  himself, even as early Christian apologetics and polemics attacked the  rival cults of the later classical world, which possessed forms of  ritual akin to those observed by Christianity. The existence of a  fortune-telling class among the Arabs shows that Muhammed may well  have been endowed with psychological tendencies which only awaited the  vivifying influence of Judaism and Christianity to emerge as the  prophetic impulse forcing him to stand forth in public and to stir the  people from their indifference: \"Be ye converted, for the day of  judgment is at hand: God has declared it unto me, as he declared it  unto Moses and Jesus. I am the apostle of God to you, Arabs. Salvation  is yours only if ye submit to the will of God preached by me.\" This  act of submission Muhammed calls Islam. Thus at the hour of Islam's  birth, before its founder had proclaimed his ideas, the influence of  Christianity is indisputable. It was this influence which made of the  Arab seer and inspired prophet, the apostle of God.    Muhammed regarded Judaism and Christianity as religious movements  purely national in character. God in His mercy had announced His will  to different nations through His prophets. As God's word had been  interpreted for the Jews and for the Christians, so there was to be a  special interpretation for the benefit of the Arabs. These  interpretations were naturally identical in manner and differed only  as regards place and time. Muhammed had heard of the Jewish Messiah  and of the Christian Paraclete, whom, however, he failed to identify  with the Holy Ghost and he applied to himself the allusions to one who  should come after Moses and Jesus. Thus in the Qoran 61.6 we read,  \"Jesus, the Son of Mary, said: Children of Israel, I am God's apostle  to you. I confirm in your hands the Thora (the law) and I announce the  coming of another apostle after me whose name is Ahmed.\" Ahmed is the  equivalent of Muhammed. The verse has been variously interpreted and  even rejected as an interpolation: but its authenticity is attested by  its perfect correspondence with what we know of Muhammed's  pretensions.    To trace in detail the development of his attitude towards  Christianity is a more difficult task than to discover the growth of  his views upon Judaism; probably he pursued a similar course in either  case. At first he assumed the identity of the two religions with one  another and with his own doctrine; afterwards he regarded them as  advancing by gradations. Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammed,  these in his opinion were the chief stages in the divine scheme of  salvation. Each was respectively confirmed or abolished by the  revelation which followed it, nor is this theory of Muhammed's shaken  by the fact that each revelation was given to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#2)"],[1," The Side-line  40.

DISEASES OF THE HORSE'S FOOT        CHAPTER I    INTRODUCTION      The importance of that branch of veterinary surgery dealing with diseases  of the horse's foot can hardly be overestimated. That the animal's  usefulness is dependent upon his possession of four good feet is a fact  that has long been recognised. Who, indeed, is there to be found entirely  unacquainted with one or other of such well-known aphorisms as: 'Whoever  hath charge of a horse's foot has the care of his whole body'; 'As well a  horse with no head as a horse with no foot'; or the perhaps better known,  and certainly more epigrammatic, 'No foot, no horse.'    Without taking these sayings literally, it will be admitted by almost  everyone that they contain a vast amount of actual truth. This allowed, it  at once becomes clear that a ready understanding of the diseases to which  the foot is liable, the means of holding them in check, and the correct  methods of treating them should figure largely in the knowledge at the  command of the veterinary surgeon.    In the very great majority of instances the horse's ability to perform  labour is the one thing that justifies his existence, and to that end the  presence of four good, sound feet is an almost indispensable qualification.  And yet how many circumstances do we see tending to militate against that  one essential.    Even in colthood the foot, if neglected, may become a source of trouble.  Unless periodically examined and properly trimmed, its shape is liable to  serious alteration. From that in which it is best calculated to withstand  the effects of the wear it will be called upon to endure in after life, it  may become so changed for the worse as to seriously affect the animal's  value.    In the matter of feeding, too, trouble is likely to ensue. Particularly is  this the case where the colt shows points of exceptional merit. He is 'got  up' for show, and the feet are likely to fall victims to the mismanagement  that frequent exhibition so often carries with it. An extra allowance of  peas, beans, wheat, or other equally injurious food is given. The result is  a severe attack of laminitis, and an otherwise valuable and promising colt  is permanently ruined.    Exposed as it is, too, to injury, the foot of a young horse, even at grass,  is frequently the seat of injuries from picked up nails, stakes, or other  agents which, unless detected and carefully treated, may terminate in a  troublesome case of quittor and incurable lameness.    With the passing of colthood, and the coming into effect of the evils of  further domestication, the troubles to which the foot is open become more  numerous. Foremost among them will come those having their starting-point  in errors of practice originating in the forge; for, in spite of attempts  at their education, smiths, as a class, are as yet grievously unversed in  even the elementary knowledge of the delicate construction of the member  that is entrusted to their care.    This fact has been dilated on in books devoted to shoeing, and in the  prefatory note to the last edition of Fleming's manual on this subject we  find the following statement: 'The records of all humane societies show  that, of prosecutions for cruelty to animals, an overwhelming majority  refer to the horse; and of these, a large proportion are for working horses  while suffering from lameness in one form or other.    'So frequent are such cases that observers have concluded that their  prevalence must result from some specific cause, and, not"]]]
