If, therefore, I cannot perceive  innumerable parts in any finite extension that I consider, it is certain  they are not contained in it; but, it is evident that I cannot  distinguish innumerable parts in any particular line, surface, or solid,  which I either perceive by sense, or figure to myself in my mind:  wherefore I conclude they are not contained in it. Nothing can be plainer  to me than that the extensions I have in view are no other than my own  ideas; and it is no less plain that I cannot resolve any one of my ideas  into an infinite number of other ideas, that is, that they are not  infinitely divisible. If by finite extension be meant something distinct  from a finite idea, I declare I do not know what that is, and so cannot  affirm or deny anything of it. But if the terms \"extension,\" \"parts,\"  &c., are taken in any sense conceivable, that is, for ideas, then to say  a finite quantity or extension consists of parts infinite in number is so  manifest a contradiction, that every one at first sight acknowledges it  to be so; and it is impossible it should ever gain the assent of any  reasonable creature who is not brought to it by gentle and slow degrees,  as a converted Gentile to the belief of transubstantiation. Ancient and  rooted prejudices do often pass into principles; and those propositions  which once obtain the force and credit of a principle, are not only  themselves, but likewise whatever is deducible from them, thought  privileged from all examination. And there is no absurdity so gross,  which, by this means, the mind of man may not be prepared to swallow.    125. He whose understanding is possessed with the doctrine of abstract  general ideas may be persuaded that (whatever be thought of the ideas of  sense) extension in abstract is infinitely divisible. And one who thinks  the objects of sense exist without the mind will perhaps in virtue  thereof be brought to admit that a line but an inch long may contain  innumerable parts--really existing, though too small to be discerned.  These errors are grafted as well in the minds of geometricians as of  other men, and have a like influence on their reasonings; and it were no  difficult thing to show how the arguments from Geometry made use of to  support the infinite divisibility of extension are bottomed on them. At  present we shall only observe in general whence it is the mathematicians  are all so fond and tenacious of that doctrine.    126. It has been observed in another place that the theorems and  demonstrations in Geometry are conversant about universal ideas (sect.  15, Introd.); where it is explained in what sense this ought to be  understood, to wit, the particular lines and figures included in the  diagram are supposed to stand for innumerable others of different sizes;  or, in other words, the geometer considers them abstracting from their  magnitude--which does not imply that he forms an abstract idea, but only  that he cares not what the particular magnitude is, whether great or  small, but looks on that as a thing different to the demonstration. Hence  it follows that a line in the scheme but an inch long must be spoken of  as though it contained ten thousand parts, since it is regarded not in  itself, but as it is universal; and it is universal only in its  signification, whereby it represents innumerable lines greater than  itself, in which may be distinguished ten thousand parts or more, though  there may not be above an inch in it. After this manner, the properties  of the lines signified are (by a very usual figure) transferred to the  sign, and thence, through mistake, though to appertain to it considered  in its own nature.    127. Because there is no number of parts so great but it is possible  there may be a line containing more, the inch-line is said to contain  parts more than any assignable number; which is true, not of the inch  taken absolutely, but only for the things signified by it. But men, not  retaining that distinction in their thoughts, slide into a belief that  the small particular line described on paper contains in itself parts  innumerable. There is no such thing as the ten--thousandth part of an  inch; but there is of a mile or diameter of the earth, which may be  signified by that inch. When therefore I delineate a triangle on paper,  and take one side not above an inch, for example, in length to be the  radius, this I consider as divided into 10,000 or 100,000 parts or more;  for, though the ten-thousandth part of that line considered in itself is  nothing at all, and consequently may be neglected without an error or  inconveniency, yet these described lines, being only marks standing for  greater quantities, whereof it may be the ten--thousandth part is very  considerable, it follows that, to prevent notable errors in practice, the  radius must be taken of 10,000 parts or more.    128. LINES WHICH ARE INFINITELY DIVISIBLE.--From what has been said  the reason is plain why, to the end any theorem become universal in  its use, it is necessary we speak of the lines described on paper  as though they contained parts which really they do not. In doing  of which, if we examine the matter thoroughly, we shall perhaps  discover that we cannot conceive an inch itself as consisting of,  or being divisible into, a thousand parts, but only some other line which  is far greater than an inch, and represented by it; and that when we say  a line is infinitely divisible, we must mean a line which is infinitely  great. What we have here observed seems to be the chief cause why, to  suppose the infinite divisibility of finite extension has been thought  necessary in geometry.    129. The several absurdities and contradictions which flowed from this  false principle might, one would think, have been esteemed so many  demonstrations against it. But, by I know not what logic, it is held that  proofs a posteriori are not to be admitted against propositions relating  to infinity, as though it were not impossible even for an infinite mind  to reconcile contradictions; or as if anything absurd and repugnant could  have a necessary connexion with truth or flow from it. But, whoever  considers the weakness of this pretence will think it was contrived on  purpose to humour the laziness of the mind which had rather acquiesce in  an indolent scepticism than be at the pains to go through with a severe  examination of those principles it has ever embraced for true.    130. Of late the speculations about Infinities have run so high, and  grown to such strange notions, as have occasioned no small scruples and  disputes among the geometers of the present age. Some there are of great  note who, not content with holding that finite lines may be divided into  an infinite number of parts, do yet farther maintain that each of those  infinitesimals is itself subdivisible into an infinity of other parts or  infinitesimals of a second order, and so on ad infinitum. These, I say,  assert there are infinitesimals of infinitesimals of infinitesimals, &c.,  without ever coming to an end; so that according to them an inch does not  barely contain an infinite number of parts, but an infinity of an  infinity of an infinity ad infinitum of parts. Others there be who hold  all orders of infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all;  thinking it with good reason absurd to imagine there is any positive  quantity or part of extension which, though multiplied infinitely, can  never equal the smallest given extension. And yet on the other hand it  seems no less absurd to think the square, cube or other power of a  positive real root, should itself be nothing at all; which they who hold  infinitesimals of the first order, denying all of the subsequent orders,  are obliged to maintain.    131. OBJECTION OF MATHEMATICIANS.--ANSWER.--Have we not therefore  reason to conclude they are both in the wrong, and that there is  in effect no such thing as parts infinitely small, or an infinite  number of parts contained in any finite quantity? But you will  say that if this doctrine obtains it will follow the very foundations  of Geometry are destroyed, and those great men who have raised  that science to so astonishing a height, have been all the while  building a castle in the air. To this it may be replied that whatever is  useful in geometry, and promotes the benefit of human life, does still  remain firm and unshaken on our principles; that science considered as  practical will rather receive advantage than any prejudice from what has  been said. But to set this in a due light may be the proper business of  another place. For the rest, though it should follow that some of the  more intricate and subtle parts of Speculative Mathematics may be pared  off without any prejudice to truth, yet I do not see what damage will be  thence derived to mankind. On the contrary, I think it were highly to be  wished that men of great abilities and obstinate application would draw  off their thoughts from those amusements, and employ them in the study of  such things as lie nearer the concerns of life, or have a more direct  influence on the manners.    132. SECOND OBJECTION OF MATHEMATICIANS.--ANSWER.--If it be said  that several theorems undoubtedly true are discovered by methods  in which infinitesimals are made use of, which could never have  been if their existence included a contradiction in it; I answer  that upon a thorough examination it will not be found that in any  instance it is necessary to make use of or conceive infinitesimal parts  of finite lines, or even quantities less than the minimum sensible; nay,  it will be evident this is never done, it being impossible.    133. IF THE DOCTRINE WERE ONLY AN HYPOTHESIS IT SHOULD BE RESPECTED  FOR ITS CONSEQUENCES.--By what we have premised, it is plain that very  numerous and important errors have taken their rise from those false  Principles which were impugned in the foregoing parts of this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#19)"],[1,"mind, then these things are ideas. But  whether you do or do not call them IDEAS, it matters little. The  difference is only about a name. And, whether that name be retained or  rejected, the sense, the truth, and reality of things continues the same.  In common talk, the objects of our senses are not termed IDEAS, but  THINGS. Call them so still: provided you do not attribute to them any  absolute external existence, and I shall never quarrel with you for a  word. The creation, therefore, I allow to have been a creation of things,  of REAL things. Neither is this in the least inconsistent with my  principles, as is evident from what I have now said; and would have been  evident to you without this, if you had not forgotten what had been so  often said before. But as for solid corporeal substances, I desire you to  show where Moses makes any mention of them; and, if they should be  mentioned by him, or any other inspired writer, it would still be  incumbent on you to shew those words were not taken in the vulgar  acceptation, for things falling under our senses, but in the philosophic  acceptation, for Matter, or AN UNKNOWN QUIDDITY, WITH AN ABSOLUTE  EXISTENCE. When you have proved these points, then (and not till then)  may you bring the authority of Moses into our dispute.    HYL.  It is in vain to dispute about a point so clear. I am content to  refer it to your own conscience. Are you not satisfied there is some  peculiar repugnancy between the Mosaic account of the creation and your  notions?    PHIL.  If all possible sense which can be put on the first chapter of  Genesis may be conceived as consistently with my principles as any other,  then it has no peculiar repugnancy with them. But there is no sense you  may not as well conceive, believing as I do. Since, besides spirits, all  you conceive are ideas; and the existence of these I do not deny. Neither  do you pretend they exist without the mind.    HYL.  Pray let me see any sense you can understand it in.    PHIL.  Why, I imagine that if I had been present at the creation, I  should have seen things produced into being--that is become  perceptible--in the order prescribed by the sacred historian. I ever  before believed the Mosaic account of the creation, and now find no  alteration in my manner of believing it. When things are said to begin or  end their existence, we do not mean this with regard to God, but  His creatures. All objects are eternally known by God, or, which is the  same thing, have an eternal existence in His mind: but when things,  before imperceptible to creatures, are, by a decree of God, perceptible  to them, then are they said to begin a relative existence, with respect  to created minds. Upon reading therefore the Mosaic account of the  creation, I understand that the several parts of the world became  gradually perceivable to finite spirits, endowed with proper faculties;  so that, whoever such were present, they were in truth perceived by them.  This is the literal obvious sense suggested to me by the words of the  Holy Scripture: in which is included no mention, or no thought, either of  SUBSTRATUM, INSTRUMENT, OCCASION, or ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE. And, upon  inquiry, I doubt not it will be found that most plain honest men, who  believe the creation, never think of those things any more than I. What  metaphysical sense you may understand it in, you only can tell.    HYL.  But, Philonous, you do not seem to be aware that you allow created  things, in the beginning, only a relative, and consequently hypothetical  being: that is to say, upon supposition there were MEN to perceive  them; without which they have no actuality of absolute existence, wherein  creation might terminate. Is it not, therefore, according to you, plainly  impossible the creation of any inanimate creatures should precede that of  man? And is not this directly contrary to the Mosaic account?    PHIL.  In answer to that, I say, first, created beings might begin to  exist in the mind of other created intelligences, beside men. You will  not therefore be able to prove any contradiction between Moses and my  notions, unless you first shew there was no other order of finite created  spirits in being, before man. I say farther, in case we conceive the  creation, as we should at this time, a parcel of plants or vegetables of  all sorts produced, by an invisible Power, in a desert where nobody was  present--that this way of explaining or conceiving it is consistent with  my principles, since they deprive you of nothing, either sensible or  imaginable; that it exactly suits with the common, natural, and  undebauched notions of mankind; that it manifests the dependence of all  things on God; and consequently hath all the good effect or influence,  which it is possible that important article of our faith should have in  making men humble, thankful, and resigned to their great Creator. I  say, moreover, that, in this naked conception of things, divested  of words, there will not be found any notion of what you call the  ACTUALITY OF ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE. You may indeed raise a dust with those  terms, and so lengthen our dispute to no purpose. But I entreat you  calmly to look into your own thoughts, and then tell me if they are not a  useless and unintelligible jargon.    HYL.  I own I have no very clear notion annexed to them. But what say  you to this? Do you not make the existence of sensible things consist in  their being in a mind? And were not all things eternally in the mind of  God? Did they not therefore exist from all eternity, according to you?  And how could that which was eternal be created in time? Can anything be  clearer or better connected than this?    PHIL.  And are not you too of opinion, that God knew all things from  eternity?    HYL.  I am.    PHIL.  Consequently they always had a being in the Divine intellect.    HYL.  This I acknowledge.    PHIL.  By your own confession, therefore, nothing is new, or begins to  be, in respect of the mind of God. So we are agreed in that point.    HYL.  What shall we make then of the creation?    PHIL.  May we not understand it to have been entirely in respect of  finite spirits; so that things, with regard to us, may properly be said  to begin their existence, or be created, when God decreed they should  become perceptible to intelligent creatures, in that order and manner  which He then established, and we now call the laws of nature? You may  call this a RELATIVE, or HYPOTHETICAL EXISTENCE if you please. But,  so long as it supplies us with the most natural, obvious, and literal  sense of the Mosaic history of the creation; so long as it answers all  the religious ends of that great article; in a word, so long as you can  assign no other sense or meaning in its stead; why should we reject this?  Is it to comply with a ridiculous sceptical humour of making everything  nonsense and unintelligible? I am sure you cannot say it is for the glory  of God. For, allowing it to be a thing possible and conceivable that the  corporeal world should have an absolute existence extrinsical to the mind  of God, as well as to the minds of all created spirits; yet how could  this set forth either the immensity or omniscience of the Deity, or the  necessary and immediate dependence of all things on Him? Nay, would  it not rather seem to derogate from those attributes?    HYL.  Well, but as to this decree of God's, for making things  perceptible, what say you, Philonous? Is it not plain, God did either  execute that decree from all eternity, or at some certain time began to  will what He had not actually willed before, but only designed to will?  If the former, then there could be no creation, or beginning of  existence, in finite things. If the latter, then we must acknowledge  something new to befall the Deity; which implies a sort of change: and  all change argues imperfection.    PHIL.  Pray consider what you are doing. Is it not evident this  objection concludes equally against a creation in any sense; nay, against  every other act of the Deity, discoverable by the light of nature? None  of which can WE conceive, otherwise than as performed in time, and  having a beginning. God is a Being of transcendent and unlimited  perfections: His nature, therefore, is incomprehensible to finite  spirits. It is not, therefore, to be expected, that any man, whether  Materialist or Immaterialist, should have exactly just notions of the  Deity, His attributes, and ways of operation. If then you would infer  anything against me, your difficulty must not be drawn from the  inadequateness of our conceptions of the Divine nature, which is  unavoidable on any scheme; but from the denial of Matter, of which there  is not one word, directly or indirectly, in what you have now objected.    HYL.  I must acknowledge the difficulties you are concerned to clear are  such only as arise from the non-existence of Matter, and are peculiar to  that notion. So far you are in the right. But I cannot by any means bring  myself to think there is no such peculiar repugnancy between the creation  and your opinion; though indeed where to fix it, I do not distinctly  know.    PHIL.  What would you have? Do I not acknowledge a twofold state of  things--the one ectypal or natural, the other archetypal and eternal? The  former was created in time; the latter existed from everlasting in the  mind of God. Is not this agreeable to the common notions of divines? or,  is any more than this necessary in order to conceive the creation? But  you suspect some peculiar repugnancy, though you know not where it lies.  To take away all possibility of scruple in the case, do but consider this  one point. Either you are not able to conceive the Creation on any  hypothesis whatsoever; and, if so, there is no ground for dislike or  complaint against any particular opinion on that score: or you are able  to conceive it; and, if so, why not on my Principles, since thereby  nothing"]]]
