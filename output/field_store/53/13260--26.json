His sisters, who, taking after their mother, were  all true Scotchwomen, now urged upon him to comply with Archie's  request and accompany him to Lanark. Their hearts and wishes were  entirely with the champion of their country.    \"Go with him, Robert,\" Isabel, the eldest, exclaimed.  \"Neither  I nor my sisters fear being struck with the arrows, although such  might well be the case should a conflict begin; but, for your own  sake and Scotland's, go and see Wallace.  No harm can arise from  such a journey, and much good may come of it. Even should the  news of your having had an interview with him come to the ears of  Edward, you can truly say that you were taken thither a captive,  and that we being with you, you were unable to make an effort to  free yourself.  This young knight, of whose deeds of gallantry we  have all heard\"--and she smiled approvingly at Archie--\"will  doubtless give you a safeguard, on his honour, to return hither  free and unpledged when you have seen Wallace.\"    \"Willingly, lady,\" Archie replied. \"One hour's interview with my  honoured chief is all I ask for. That over, I pledge myself that  the Earl of Carrick shall be free at once to return hither, and  that an escort shall be provided for him to protect him from all  dangers on the way.\"          Chapter VIII    The Council at Stirling      Archie had been mounted on the march from the camp, and his horse  being now brought, he started with Bruce, young Nigel and the ladies  saluting him cordially.    \"I trust,\" the former said, \"that Wallace will succeed in converting  my brother. I am envious of you, Sir Archie. Here are you, many  years younger than I am, and yet you have won a name throughout  Scotland as one of her champions; while I am eating my heart out,  with my brother, at the court of Edward.\"    \"I trust it may be so, Sir Nigel,\" Archie answered. \"If Sir Robert  will but join our cause, heart and soul, the battle is as good as  won.\"    The journey passed without adventure until they arrived within two  miles of Lanark, where Archie found Wallace was now staying. On  the road Bruce had had much conversation with Archie, and learned  the details of many adventures of which before he had only heard  vaguely by report. He was much struck by the lad's modesty and  loyal patriotism.    \"If ever I come to my kingdom, Sir Archie,\" he said, \"you shall  be one of my most trusted knights and counsellors; and I am well  assured that any advice you may give will be ever what you think  to be right and for the good of the country, without self seeking  or in the interest of any; and that is more than I could look for  in most counsellors. And now methinks that as we are drawing near  to Lanark, it will be well that I waited here in this wood, under  the guard of your followers, while you ride forward and inform  Wallace that I am here. I care not to show myself in Lanark, for  busy tongues would soon take the news to Edward; and as I know not  what may come of our interview, it were well that it should not be  known to all men.\"    Archie agreed, and rode into the town.    \"Why, where have you been, truant?\" Sir William exclaimed as Archie  entered the room in the governor's house which had been set apart  for the use of Wallace since the expulsion of the English. \"Sir  Robert Gordon has been here several times, and tells me that they  have seen nought of you; and although I have made many inquiries I  have been able to obtain no news, save that you and your band have  disappeared.  I even sent to Glen Cairn, thinking that you might  have been repairing the damages which the fire, lighted by the  Kerrs, did to your hold; but I found not only that you were not  there yourself, but that none of your band had returned thither.  This made it more mysterious; for had you alone disappeared I should  have supposed that you had been following up some love adventure,  though, indeed, you have never told me that your heart was in any  way touched.\"    Archie laughed. \"There will be time enough for that, Sir William,  ten years hence; but in truth I have been on an adventure on my  own account.\"    \"So, in sober earnest, I expected, Archie, and feared that your  enterprise might lead you into some serious scrape since I deemed  that it must have been well nigh a desperate one or you would not  have hidden it from my knowledge.\"    \"It might have led to some blows, Sir William, but happily it did  not turn out so. Knowing the importance you attached to the adhesion  of the cause of Scotland of Robert the Bruce, I determined to fetch  him hither to see you; and he is now waiting with my band for your  coming, in a wood some two miles from the town.\"    \"Are you jesting with me?\" Wallace exclaimed. \"Is the Bruce really  waiting to see me? Why, this would be well nigh a miracle.\"    \"It is a fact, Sir William; and if you will cause your horse to  be brought to the door I will tell you on the road how it has come  about.\"    In another five minutes Sir William and his young follower were  on their way, and the former heard how Archie had entrapped Robert  Bruce while riding to Crossraguel Abbey.    \"It was well done, indeed,\" the Scottish leader exclaimed; \"and  it may well prove, Archie, that you have done more towards freeing  Scotland by this adventure of yours than we have by all our months  of marching and fighting.\"    \"Ah! Sir William, but had it not been for our marching and fighting  Bruce would never have wavered in his allegiance to Edward. It was  only because he begins to think that our cause may be a winning  one that he decides to join it.\"    The meeting between Wallace and Bruce was a cordial one. Each  admired the splendid proportions and great strength of the other,  for it is probable that in all Europe there were no two more  doughty champions; although, indeed, Wallace was far the superior  in personal strength while Bruce was famous through Europe for his  skill in knightly exercise.    Archie withdrew to a distance while the leaders conversed. He  could see that their talk was animated as they strode together up  and down among the trees, Wallace being the principal speaker. At  the end of half an hour they stopped, and Wallace ordered the horses  to be brought, and then called Archie to them.    \"Sir Robert has decided to throw in his lot with us,\" he said, \"and  will at once call out his father's vassals of Carrick and Annandale.  Seeing that his father is at Edward's court, it may be that many  will not obey the summons. Still we must hope that, for the love  of Scotland and their young lord, many will follow him. He will  write to the pope to ask him to absolve him for the breach of his  oath of homage to Edward; but as such oaths lie but lightly on men's  minds in our days, and have been taken and broken by King Edward  himself, as well as by Sir William Douglas and other knights who are  now in the field with me, he will not wait for the pope's reply,  but will at once take the field. And, indeed, there is need for  haste, seeing that Percy and Clifford have already crossed the  Border with an English army and are marching north through Annandale  towards Ayr.\"    \"Goodbye, my captor,\" Bruce said to Archie as he mounted his horse;  \"whatever may come of this strife, remember that you will always  find a faithful friend in Robert Bruce.\"    Wallace had, at Archie's request, brought six mounted men-at-arms  with him from Lanark, and these now rode behind Bruce as his escort  back to his castle of Turnberry. There was no time now for Archie  and his band to take the rest they had looked for, for messengers  were sent out to gather the bands together again, and as soon as  a certain portion had arrived Wallace marched for the south. The  English army was now in Annandale, near Lochmaben. They were far  too strong to be openly attacked, but on the night following his  arrival in their neighbourhood Wallace broke in upon them in the  night. Surprised by this sudden and unexpected attack, the English  fell into great confusion. Percy at once ordered the camp to be  set on fire.  By its light the English were able to see how small  was the force of their assailants, and gathering together soon  showed so formidable a front that Wallace called off his men, but  not before a large number of the English had been killed. Many of  their stores, as well as the tents, were destroyed by the conflagration.  The English army now proceeded with slow marches towards Ayr.  At  Irvine the Scotch leaders had assembled their army--Douglas,  Bruce, The Steward, Sir Richard Loudon, Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow,  and others.  Their forces were about equal to those of the English  marching against them. Wallace was collecting troops further north,  and Archie was of course with him.    \"I fear,\" the lad said one day, \"that we shall not be able to reach  Irvine before the armies join battle.\"    \"Sir William Douglas and Bruce are there, and as it lies in their  country it were better to let them win the day without my meddling.  But, Archie, I fear there will be no battle.  News has reached  me that messengers are riding to and fro between Percy's army and  the Scots, and I fear me that these half hearted barons will make  peace.\"    \"Surely that cannot be! It were shame indeed to have taken up the  sword, and to lay it down after scarce striking a blow.\"    \"Methinks, Archie, that the word shame is not to be found in the  vocabulary of the nobles of this unhappy land. But let us hope for  the best; a few days will bring us the news.\"    The news when it came was of the worst. All the nobles, headed by  Wishart, Douglas, and Bruce, with the exception only of Sir Andrew  Moray of Bothwell, had made their submission, acknowledging their  guilt of rebellion,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#19)"],[1,"hange.

Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet      republics, producing 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor      force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies important producer      and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to the other states.      The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by      emphasizing favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens),      Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,      eggs, flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and      gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil      pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit      Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals,      plastics, synthetic fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and      fertilizer (20% of former Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited      to potash and peat deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for      the former Soviet Union) is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for      electric power stations and in the production of chemicals. The potash      supports fertilizer production.
