Phaidor--\" she stumbled a little here, and then in a very low  voice, \"Phaidor already is yours.\"    I felt very sorry for the poor child, and placed my hand over hers  where it rested on my arm.  I presume my motive was misunderstood, for  with a swift glance about the apartment to assure herself that we were  alone, she threw both her arms about my neck and dragged my face down  to hers.          CHAPTER IX    ISSUS, GODDESS OF LIFE ETERNAL      The confession of love which the girl's fright had wrung from her  touched me deeply; but it humiliated me as well, since I felt that in  some thoughtless word or act I had given her reason to believe that I  reciprocated her affection.    Never have I been much of a ladies' man, being more concerned with  fighting and kindred arts which have ever seemed to me more befitting a  man than mooning over a scented glove four sizes too small for him, or  kissing a dead flower that has begun to smell like a cabbage.  So I was  quite at a loss as to what to do or say.  A thousand times rather face  the wild hordes of the dead sea bottoms than meet the eyes of this  beautiful young girl and tell her the thing that I must tell her.    But there was nothing else to be done, and so I did it.  Very clumsily  too, I fear.    Gently I unclasped her hands from about my neck, and still holding them  in mine I told her the story of my love for Dejah Thoris.  That of all  the women of two worlds that I had known and admired during my long  life she alone had I loved.    The tale did not seem to please her.  Like a tigress she sprang,  panting, to her feet.  Her beautiful face was distorted in an  expression of horrible malevolence.  Her eyes fairly blazed into mine.    \"Dog,\" she hissed.  \"Dog of a blasphemer!  Think you that Phaidor,  daughter of Matai Shang, supplicates?  She commands.  What to her is  your puny outer world passion for the vile creature you chose in your  other life?    \"Phaidor has glorified you with her love, and you have spurned her.  Ten thousand unthinkably atrocious deaths could not atone for the  affront that you have put upon me.  The thing that you call Dejah  Thoris shall die the most horrible of them all.  You have sealed the  warrant for her doom.    \"And you!  You shall be the meanest slave in the service of the goddess  you have attempted to humiliate.  Tortures and ignominies shall be  heaped upon you until you grovel at my feet asking the boon of death.    \"In my gracious generosity I shall at length grant your prayer, and  from the high balcony of the Golden Cliffs I shall watch the great  white apes tear you asunder.\"    She had it all fixed up.  The whole lovely programme from start to  finish.  It amazed me to think that one so divinely beautiful could at  the same time be so fiendishly vindictive.  It occurred to me, however,  that she had overlooked one little factor in her revenge, and so,  without any intent to add to her discomfiture, but rather to permit her  to rearrange her plans along more practical lines, I pointed to the  nearest port-hole.    Evidently she had entirely forgotten her surroundings and her present  circumstances, for a single glance at the dark, swirling waters without  sent her crumpled upon a low bench, where with her face buried in her  arms she sobbed more like a very unhappy little girl than a proud and  all-powerful goddess.    Down, down we continued to sink until the heavy glass of the port-holes  became noticeably warm from the heat of the water without.  Evidently  we were very far beneath the surface crust of Mars.    Presently our downward motion ceased, and I could hear the propellers  swirling through the water at our stern and forcing us ahead at high  speed.  It was very dark down there, but the light from our port-holes,  and the reflection from what must have been a powerful searchlight on  the submarine's nose showed that we were forging through a narrow  passage, rock-lined, and tube-like.    After a few minutes the propellers ceased their whirring.  We came to a  full stop, and then commenced to rise swiftly toward the surface.  Soon  the light from without increased and we came to a stop.    Xodar entered the cabin with his men.    \"Come,\" he said, and we followed him through the hatchway which had  been opened by one of the seamen.    We found ourselves in a small subterranean vault, in the centre of  which was the pool in which lay our submarine, floating as we had first  seen her with only her black back showing.    Around the edge of the pool was a level platform, and then the walls of  the cave rose perpendicularly for a few feet to arch toward the centre  of the low roof.  The walls about the ledge were pierced with a number  of entrances to dimly lighted passageways.    Toward one of these our captors led us, and after a short walk halted  before a steel cage which lay at the bottom of a shaft rising above us  as far as one could see.    The cage proved to be one of the common types of elevator cars that I  had seen in other parts of Barsoom.  They are operated by means of  enormous magnets which are suspended at the top of the shaft.  By an  electrical device the volume of magnetism generated is regulated and  the speed of the car varied.    In long stretches they move at a sickening speed, especially on the  upward trip, since the small force of gravity inherent to Mars results  in very little opposition to the powerful force above.    Scarcely had the door of the car closed behind us than we were slowing  up to stop at the landing above, so rapid was our ascent of the long  shaft.    When we emerged from the little building which houses the upper  terminus of the elevator, we found ourselves in the midst of a  veritable fairyland of beauty.  The combined languages of Earth men  hold no words to convey to the mind the gorgeous beauties of the scene.    One may speak of scarlet sward and ivory-stemmed trees decked with  brilliant purple blooms; of winding walks paved with crushed rubies,  with emerald, with turquoise, even with diamonds themselves; of a  magnificent temple of burnished gold, hand-wrought with marvellous  designs; but where are the words to describe the glorious colours that  are unknown to earthly eyes? where the mind or the imagination that can  grasp the gorgeous scintillations of unheard-of rays as they emanate  from the thousand nameless jewels of Barsoom?    Even my eyes, for long years accustomed to the barbaric splendours of a  Martian Jeddak's court, were amazed at the glory of the scene.    Phaidor's eyes were wide in amazement.    \"The Temple of Issus,\" she whispered, half to herself.    Xodar watched us with his grim smile, partly of amusement and partly  malicious gloating.    The gardens swarmed with brilliantly trapped black men and women.  Among them moved red and white females serving their every want.  The  places of the outer world and the temples of the therns had been robbed  of their princesses and goddesses that the blacks might have their  slaves.    Through this scene we moved toward the temple.  At the main entrance we  were halted by a cordon of armed guards.  Xodar spoke a few words to an  officer who came forward to question us.  Together they entered the  temple, where they remained for some time.    When they returned it was to announce that Issus desired to look upon  the daughter of Matai Shang, and the strange creature from another  world who had been a Prince of Helium.    Slowly we moved through endless corridors of unthinkable beauty;  through magnificent apartments, and noble halls.  At length we were  halted in a spacious chamber in the centre of the temple.  One of the  officers who had accompanied us advanced to a large door in the further  end of the chamber.  Here he must have made some sort of signal for  immediately the door opened and another richly trapped courtier emerged.    We were then led up to the door, where we were directed to get down on  our hands and knees with our backs toward the room we were to enter.  The doors were swung open and after being cautioned not to turn our  heads under penalty of instant death we were commanded to back into the  presence of Issus.    Never have I been in so humiliating a position in my life, and only my  love for Dejah Thoris and the hope which still clung to me that I might  again see her kept me from rising to face the goddess of the First Born  and go down to my death like a gentleman, facing my foes and with their  blood mingling with mine.    After we had crawled in this disgusting fashion for a matter of a  couple of hundred feet we were halted by our escort.    \"Let them rise,\" said a voice behind us; a thin, wavering voice, yet  one that had evidently been accustomed to command for many years.    \"Rise,\" said our escort, \"but do not face toward Issus.\"    \"The woman pleases me,\" said the thin, wavering voice again after a few  moments of silence.  \"She shall serve me the allotted time.  The man  you may return to the Isle of Shador which lies against the northern  shore of the Sea of Omean.  Let the woman turn and look upon Issus,  knowing that those of the lower orders who gaze upon the holy vision of  her radiant face survive the blinding glory but a single year.\"    I watched Phaidor from the corner of my eye.  She paled to a ghastly  hue.  Slowly, very slowly she turned, as though drawn by some invisible  yet irresistible force.  She was standing quite close to me, so close  that her bare arm touched mine as she finally faced Issus, Goddess of  Life Eternal.    I could not see the girl's face as her eyes rested for the first time  on the Supreme Deity of Mars, but felt the shudder that ran through her  in the trembling flesh of the arm that touched mine.    \"It must be dazzling loveliness indeed,\" thought I, \"to cause such  emotion in the breast of so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#19)"],[1,"burthens they had carried having galled their backs, for  they have no saddles to cover them with in that country.    Those creatures not only eased our negroes, but gave us an opportunity  to carry more provisions; and our negroes loaded them very hard at this  place with flesh and roots, such as we wanted very much afterwards.    In this town we found a very little young leopard, about two spans high;  it was exceeding tame, and purred like a cat when we stroked it with our  hands, being, as I suppose, bred up among the negroes like a house-dog.  It was our black prince, it seems, who, making his tour among the  abandoned houses or huts, found this creature there, and making much of  him, and giving a bit or two of flesh to him, the creature followed him  like a dog; of which more hereafter.    Among the negroes that were killed in this battle there was one who had  a little thin bit or plate of gold, about as big as a sixpence, which  hung by a little bit of a twisted gut upon his forehead, by which we  supposed he was a man of some eminence among them; but that was not all,  for this bit of gold put us upon searching very narrowly if there was  not more of it to be had thereabouts, but we found none at all.    From this part of the country we went on for about fifteen days, and  then found ourselves obliged to march up a high ridge of mountains,  frightful to behold, and the first of the kind that we met with; and  having no guide but our little pocket-compass, we had no advantage of  information as to which was the best or the worst way, but was obliged  to choose by what we saw, and shift as well as we could. We met with  several nations of wild and naked people in the plain country before we  came to those hills, and we found them much more tractable and friendly  than those devils we had been forced to fight with; and though we could  learn little from these people, yet we understood by the signs they made  that there was a vast desert beyond these hills, and, as our negroes  called them, much lion, much spotted cat (so they called the leopard);  and they signed to us also that we must carry water with us. At the last  of these nations we furnished ourselves with as much provisions as we  could possibly carry, not knowing what we had to suffer, or what length  we had to go; and, to make our way as familiar to us as possible, I  proposed that of the last inhabitants we could find we should make some  prisoners and carry them with us for guides over the desert, and to  assist us in carrying provision, and, perhaps, in getting it too. The  advice was too necessary to be slighted; so finding, by our dumb signs  to the inhabitants, that there were some people that dwelt at the foot  of the mountains on the other side before we came to the desert itself,  we resolved to furnish ourselves with guides by fair means or foul.    Here, by a moderate computation, we concluded ourselves 700 miles from  the sea-coast where we began. Our black prince was this day set free  from the sling his arm hung in, our surgeon having perfectly restored  it, and he showed it to his own countrymen quite well, which made them  greatly wonder. Also our two negroes began to recover, and their wounds  to heal apace, for our surgeon was very skilful in managing their cure.    Having with infinite labour mounted these hills, and coming to a view  of the country beyond them, it was indeed enough to astonish as stout a  heart as ever was created. It was a vast howling wilderness--not a tree,  a river, or a green thing to be seen; for, as far as the eye could look,  nothing but a scalding sand, which, as the wind blew, drove about in  clouds enough to overwhelm man and beast. Nor could we see any end of  it either before us, which was our way, or to the right hand or left;  so that truly our men began to be discouraged, and talk of going back  again. Nor could we indeed think of venturing over such a horrid place  as that before us, in which we saw nothing but present death.    I was as much affected at the sight as any of them; but, for all that,  I could not bear the thoughts of going back again. I told them we had  marched 700 miles of our way, and it would be worse than death to  think of going back again; and that, if they thought the desert was not  passable, I thought we should rather change our course, and travel south  till we came to the Cape of Good Hope, or north to the country that lay  along the Nile, where, perhaps, we might find some way or other over to  the west sea; for sure all Africa was not a desert.    Our gunner, who, as I said before, was our guide as to the situation  of places, told us that he could not tell what to say to going for the  Cape, for it was a monstrous length, being from the place where we now  were not less than 1500 miles; and, by his account, we were now come a  third part of the way to the coast of Angola, where we should meet the  western ocean, and find ways enough for our escape home. On the other  hand, he assured us, and showed us a map of it, that, if we went  northward, the western shore of Africa went out into the sea above  1000 miles west, so that we should have so much and more land to travel  afterwards; which land might, for aught we knew, be as wild, barren,  and desert as this. And therefore, upon the whole, he proposed that we  should attempt this desert, and perhaps we should not find it so long  as we feared; and however, he proposed that we should see how far our  provisions would carry us, and, in particular, our water; and we should  venture no further than half so far as our water would last; and if we  found no end of the desert, we might come safely back again.    This advice was so reasonable that we all approved of it; and  accordingly we calculated that we were able to carry provisions for  forty-two days, but that we could not carry water for above twenty days,  though we were to suppose it to stink, too, before that time expired.  So that we concluded that, if we did not come at some water in ten days'  time, we would return; but if we found a supply of water, we could then  travel twenty-one days; and, if we saw no end of the wilderness in that  time, we would return also.    With this regulation of our measures, we descended the mountains, and it  was the second day before we quite reached the plain; where, however,  to make us amends, we found a fine little rivulet of very good water,  abundance of deer, a sort of creature like a hare, but not so nimble,  but whose flesh we found very agreeable. But we were deceived in our  intelligence, for we found no people; so we got no more prisoners to  assist us in carrying our baggage.    The infinite number of deer and other creatures which we saw here, we  found was occasioned by the neighbourhood of the waste or desert, from  whence they retired hither for food and refreshment. We stored ourselves  here with flesh and roots of divers kinds, which our negroes understood  better than we, and which served us for bread; and with as much water as  (by the allowance of a quart a day to a man for our negroes, and three  pints a day a man for ourselves, and three quarts a day each for our  buffaloes) would serve us twenty days; and thus loaded for a long  miserable march, we set forwards, being all sound in health and very  cheerful, but not alike strong for so great a fatigue; and, which was  our grievance, were without a guide.    In the very first entrance of the waste we were exceedingly discouraged,  for we found the sand so deep, and it scalded our feet so much with  the heat, that after we had, as I may call it, waded rather than walked  through it about seven or eight miles, we were all heartily tired and  faint; even the very negroes laid down and panted like creatures that  had been pushed beyond their strength.    Here we found the difference of lodging greatly injurious to us; for, as  before, we always made us huts to sleep under, which covered us from the  night air, which is particularly unwholesome in those hot countries. But  we had here no shelter, no lodging, after so hard a march; for here were  no trees, no, not a shrub near us; and, which was still more frightful,  towards night we began to hear the wolves howl, the lions bellow, and  a great many wild asses braying, and other ugly noises which we did not  understand.    Upon this we reflected upon our indiscretion, that we had not, at least,  brought poles or stakes in our hands, with which we might have, as it  were, palisadoed ourselves in for the night, and so we might have slept  secure, whatever other inconveniences we suffered. However, we found  a way at last to relieve ourselves a little; for first we set up the  lances and bows we had, and endeavoured to bring the tops of them as  near to one another as we could, and so hung our coats on the top of  them, which made us a kind of sorry tent. The leopard's skin, and a few  other skins we had put together, made us a tolerable covering, and thus  we laid down to sleep, and slept very heartily too, for the first night;  setting, however, a good watch, being two of our own men with their  fuzees, whom we relieved in an hour at first, and two hours afterwards.  And it was very well we did this, for they found the wilderness swarmed  with raging creatures of all kinds, some of which came directly up to  the very enclosure of our tent. But our sentinels were ordered not to  alarm us with firing in the night, but to flash in the pan at them,  which they did, and found it effectual, for the creatures went off  always as soon as they saw it, perhaps with some noise or howling, and  pursued such other game as they were upon.    If we were tired with the day's travel, we were all as much tired with  the night's lodging. But our black prince told us in the morning he  would give us some counsel, and indeed it was very good counsel. He told  us we should be all killed if we went on this journey, and"]]]
