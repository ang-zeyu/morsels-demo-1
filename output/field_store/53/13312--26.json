Under the inspiration, however, of the Lord, Joseph made it known as  a movement required of true believers by the Almighty to prepare them  for coming events. It was a bold proclamation, and viewed from a human  standpoint, was likely to interfere with successful conversions. But  it was from the Lord, and honest seekers after truth were led to look  to Him for the evidence of its heavenly origin. The result came in due  time, and should have been convincing to every human soul. Of all the  commandments enunciated through Joseph Smith, nothing failed.    The Prophet, during the months of October and November, himself labored  in the ministry, encouraging all by his upright and zealous life,  making many converts, and spreading heavenly wisdom among all the  honest-in-heart who would give ear to his words.    In the meantime, the missionaries to the West were progressing with  their labor. They reached Kirtland, Ohio, and there made a brief stand,  because the field seemed promising. Many persons were converted to  the truth, and accepted the gospel. The Elders wrote at once to the  Prophet, informing him of these facts, and he directed John Whitmer to  proceed at once to Kirtland and preside over the branch of the Church  there.    When the Elders left Kirtland to proceed farther into the wilderness,  one of the new converts, Frederick G. Williams, accompanied them. They  went as far as Independence, Jackson County, Missouri; and were the  first of God's chosen servants in this dispensation to set foot upon  that consecrated soil.        CHAPTER XVI.    SIDNEY RIGDON AND EDWARD PARTRIDGE JOIN THE CHURCH--JOSEPH COMMENCES  THE TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES--SAINTS COMMANDED TO GATHER AT OHIO  --JOSEPH MIGRATES FROM NEW YORK--THE KIRKLAND SAINTS FALL INTO ERROR--  GOD'S POWER MANIFESTED--IMPORTANT REVELATIONS.    In December, 1830, two men came from Kirtland, Ohio, to visit the  Prophet at Fayette. They were Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge.  Both had accepted the gospel, as declared to them by the western  missionaries, and Sidney Rigdon had been baptized. After reaching  Fayette, Edward Partridge demanded and received baptism under the  Prophet's hands. These two men offered to Joseph, for the work of the  Lord, their time, their talents, and all they possessed. Like all the  early members of the Church, having not yet gained full understanding  of the purposes of God, having not yet gained confidence in their own  ability to rightly determine their conduct, they desired that the Lord  should give them His special commands. Joseph prayed for revelation on  their behalf, and was speedily answered.    The Lord revealed many comforting and exalting truths to Sidney Rigdon  and Edward Partridge. To Sidney He gave a special command that he  should write for Joseph. The Lord made known to Sidney what Joseph  already understood--that the Scriptures should be given, even as they  were in God's own bosom, to the salvation of His elect. And soon after  this time Joseph began a new translation of the Scriptures. While he  labored, many truths, buried through scores of ages, were brought forth  to his understanding, and he saw in their purity and holiness all the  doings of God among His children, from the days of Adam unto the birth  of our Lord and Savior. But before the close of December, after Sidney  had been aiding Joseph some little time, the Lord required the Prophet  to temporarily cease his work of translation. The enemy of all truth  was drawing his forces around about Fayette to achieve the destruction  of the Prophet, and the downfall of the newly-founded Church. But  they were to be foiled. Fayette was not the region where the Lord  designed His people to settle. Joseph's mind had been led to look to  the western country for that purpose. Contact with Sidney Rigdon and  Edward Partridge confirmed his inclination in that direction. The time  had now arrived when it appeared necessary for the accomplishment of  God's purposes, that His people (now increased to several score,)  should have an abiding-place. It was made known to Joseph by revelation  from the Lord, where this new resting-place should be. He himself, did  not expect to escape personal suffering or persecution by this new  move; nor was this in the providence of God concerning him. But he knew  that every migration made by him under the direction of the Almighty  had been followed by prosperity and increase to the work, and he,  therefore, obeyed the command to move to the place designated by the  Lord, without hesitation or doubt.    In the revelation now referred to, it was commanded that the people of  God should assemble in the State of Ohio, and there await the return of  Oliver Cowdery and his fellow-missionaries from their eventful journey  into the wilderness. Thus early in the history of the Church was the  destiny of the people outlined. Kirtland was to be a stake of Zion;  blessed by the presence of God's anointed Prophet and the Apostles of  our Lord Jesus Christ; glorified by a temple built to the name of the  Most High; and worthy to receive the ministrations in person of the  Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father. And yet it was to be but a  temporary resting-place; for even while the Saints were to gather to  Kirtland, the western missionaries were viewing the region in Missouri,  yet to be known as the centre stake of Zion, which was to be built up  and beautified for the visible presence of our Lord and Savior.    Before organizing his company for the migration from Seneca County,  New York, into Ohio, the Prophet called a conference of the Church to  be held in Fayette on the 2nd day of January, 1831. With the opening  of the year, the Prophet saw a glorious prospect for the welfare of  the kingdom. And at this conference all present seemed to partake of  his faith and of the power of the Holy Spirit. In a revelation given  for the comfort and sustenance of the Saints on this occasion, the  Lord made known that in secret chambers there was much plotting for  the destruction of the Saints of God. The command was renewed that  they should go into Ohio, and some of the reasons for this movement  were made known. Encouragement was also given to the people that the  Lord intended to give unto them a land of promise--a land upon which  there should be no curse when the Lord should come. If they would seek  it with all their hearts the Lord made a covenant with them that it  should be the land of inheritance for themselves and their children,  not only while the earth shall stand, but in eternity, no more to pass  away. It is upon this and kindred promises that is founded the hope so  tenaciously clung to by the Latter-day Saints amid all the vicissitudes  of their checkered career, that they will yet inherit that land where  the centre stake of Zion is to be built.    In the latter part of January, 1831, Joseph departed for Kirtland. In  his company were his wife, and Elders Sidney Rigdon, Edward Partridge,  Ezra Thayer, and Newel Knight. Before leaving Seneca County, and later  at several points on their journey, they preached in public meetings  to many searchers after the truth. On every occasion new converts  came forward and accepted baptism at their hands. They reached their  destination in the opening of February; Joseph and his wife at once  found entertainment and comfort in the house of Elder Newel K. Whitney,  one of the converts made in Kirtland by the western missionaries. For  some weeks the Prophet dwelt here, solaced and sustained by the faith  and prayers of some dear friends. But outside this little circle he  found much to cause him concern of mind.    The branch of the Church at Kirtland had become numerically strong,  for it numbered nearly one hundred members. But they had been led  into strange errors and darkness. False spirits had crept in and had  manifested themselves in the subjugation of the physical and mental  powers of their victims--as Newel Knight had formerly been controlled  and possessed by the evil power at Colesville. The Saints at Kirtland,  not having had experience to enable them to distinguish between the  powers of light and the powers of darkness, and believing these things  to be divine manifestations, were yielding to them and imperiling  their earthly and eternal salvation, when the Prophet came and by his  presence and the prayers and faith of those Elders who accompanied him,  banished all these dark influences from the congregation of the Saints.  When the faith of the Saints was aroused and exercised, the miracle  which had been wrought at Colesville was here repeated. Joseph, by the  power of God, rebuked the vile one and his crew; and his brother Hyrum,  under the Prophet's direction, laid his hands on the sufferers' heads  and cast out the devils.    Immediately following the reconciliation wrought among the Saints of  God by their faith and these miracles, a revelation was given from the  Lord directing what the Elders should do to receive His law, that they  might know how to govern His Church, and informing them that he who  received his law and doeth it is His disciple; but he that saith he  receiveth it and doeth it not, is not His disciple, and should be cast  out from among them: and also appointing unto Edward Partridge that he  should be ordained a Bishop, to leave his own affairs and devote his  time to the service of the Lord. This was on the 4th of February, 1831.  Five days later the word of the Lord again came to the Elders of the  Church, saying:        And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my      gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the      voice of a trumpet, declaring my word like unto the angels of God;      and ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying--Repent ye!      Repent ye! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.        And from this place ye shall go forth unto the regions westward;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#19)"],[1,"accordingly, though the charge  was contrary to all his habits of life, he readily undertook it, and  might be seen stalking about with a mathematical problem in his head, and  his eye upon a child of five years old, whose rambles led him into a  hundred awkward situations. Twice was the Dominie chased by a  cross-grained cow, once he fell into the brook crossing at the  stepping-stones, and another time was bogged up to the middle in the  slough of Lochend, in attempting to gather a water-lily for the young  Laird. It was the opinion of the village matrons who relieved Sampson on  the latter occasion, 'that the Laird might as weel trust the care o' his  bairn to a potatoe bogle'; but the good Dominie bore all his disasters  with gravity and serenity equally imperturbable. 'Pro-di-gi-ous!' was the  only ejaculation they ever extorted from the much-enduring man.                The Laird had by this time determined to make root-and-branch work with  the Maroons of Derncleugh. The old servants shook their heads at his  proposal, and even Dominie Sampson ventured upon an indirect  remonstrance. As, however, it was couched in the oracular phrase, 'Ne  moveas Camerinam,' neither the allusion, nor the language in which it was  expressed, were calculated for Mr. Bertram's edification, and matters  proceeded against the gipsies in form of law. Every door in the hamlet  was chalked by the ground-officer, in token of a formal warning to remove  at next term. Still, however, they showed no symptoms either of  submission or of compliance. At length the term-day, the fatal Martinmas,  arrived, and violent measures of ejection were resorted to. A strong  posse of peace-officers, sufficient to render all resistance vain,  charged the inhabitants to depart by noon; and, as they did not obey, the  officers, in terms of their warrant, proceeded to unroof the cottages,  and pull down the wretched doors and windows--a summary and effectual  mode of ejection still practised in some remote parts of Scotland when a  tenant proves refractory. The gipsies for a time beheld the work of  destruction in sullen silence and inactivity; then set about saddling and  loading their asses, and making preparations for their departure. These  were soon accomplished, where all had the habits of wandering Tartars;  and they set forth on their journey to seek new settlements, where their  patrons should neither be of the quorum nor custos rotulorum.    Certain qualms of feeling had deterred Ellangowan from attending in  person to see his tenants expelled. He left the executive part of the  business to the officers of the law, under the immediate direction of  Frank Kennedy, a supervisor, or riding-officer, belonging to the excise,  who had of late become intimate at the Place, and of whom we shall have  more to say in the next chapter. Mr. Bertram himself chose that day to  make a visit to a friend at some distance. But it so happened,  notwithstanding his precautions, that he could not avoid meeting his late  tenants during their retreat from his property.    It was in a hollow way, near the top of a steep ascent, upon the verge of  the Ellangowan estate, that Mr. Bertram met the gipsy procession. Four or  five men formed the advanced guard, wrapped in long loose great-coats  that hid their tall slender figures, as the large slouched hats, drawn  over their brows, concealed their wild features, dark eyes, and swarthy  faces. Two of them carried long fowling-pieces, one wore a broadsword  without a sheath, and all had the Highland dirk, though they did not wear  that weapon openly or ostentatiously. Behind them followed the train of  laden asses, and small carts or TUMBLERS, as they were called in that  country, on which were laid the decrepit and the helpless, the aged and  infant part of the exiled community. The women in their red cloaks and  straw hats, the elder children with bare heads and bare feet, and almost  naked bodies, had the immediate care of the little caravan. The road was  narrow, running between two broken banks of sand, and Mr. Bertram's  servant rode forward, smacking his whip with an air of authority, and  motioning to the drivers to allow free passage to their betters. His  signal was unattended to. He then called to the men who lounged idly on  before, 'Stand to your beasts' heads, and make room for the Laird to  pass.'    'He shall have his share of the road,' answered a male gipsy from under  his slouched and large-brimmed hat, and without raising his face, 'and he  shall have nae mair; the highway is as free to our cuddies as to his  gelding.'    The tone of the man being sulky, and even menacing, Mr. Bertram thought  it best to put his dignity in his pocket, and pass by the procession  quietly, on such space as they chose to leave for his accommodation,  which was narrow enough. To cover with an appearance of indifference his  feeling of the want of respect with which he was treated, he addressed  one of the men, as he passed him without any show of greeting, salute, or  recognition--'Giles Baillie,' he said, 'have you heard that your son  Gabriel is well?' (The question respected the young man who had been  pressed.)    'If I had heard otherwise,' said the old man, looking up with a stern and  menacing countenance, 'you should have heard of it too.' And he plodded  on his way, tarrying no further question. [Footnote: This anecdote is a  literal fact.] When the Laird had pressed on with difficulty among a  crowd of familiar faces, which had on all former occasions marked his  approach with the reverence due to that of a superior being, but in which  he now only read hatred and contempt, and had got clear of the throng, he  could not help turning his horse, and looking back to mark the progress  of their march. The group would have been an excellent subject for the  pencil of Calotte. The van had already reached a small and stunted  thicket, which was at the bottom of the hill, and which gradually hid the  line of march until the last stragglers disappeared.    His sensations were bitter enough. The race, it is true, which he had  thus summarily dismissed from their ancient place of refuge, was idle and  vicious; but had he endeavoured to render them otherwise? They were not  more irregular characters now than they had been while they were admitted  to consider themselves as a sort of subordinate dependents of his family;  and ought the mere circumstance of his becoming a magistrate to have made  at once such a change in his conduct towards them? Some means of  reformation ought at least to have been tried before sending seven  families at once upon the wide world, and depriving them of a degree of  countenance which withheld them at least from atrocious guilt. There was  also a natural yearning of heart on parting with so many known and  familiar faces; and to this feeling Godfrey Bertram was peculiarly  accessible, from the limited qualities of his mind, which sought its  principal amusements among the petty objects around him. As he was about  to turn his horse's head to pursue his journey, Meg Merrilies, who had  lagged behind the troop, unexpectedly presented herself.    She was standing upon one of those high precipitous banks which, as we  before noticed, overhung the road, so that she was placed considerably  higher than Ellangowan, even though he was on horseback; and her tall  figure, relieved against the clear blue sky, seemed almost of  supernatural stature. We have noticed that there was in her general  attire, or rather in her mode of adjusting it, somewhat of a foreign  costume, artfully adopted perhaps for the purpose of adding to the effect  of her spells and predictions, or perhaps from some traditional notions  respecting the dress of her ancestors. On this occasion she had a large  piece of red cotton cloth rolled about her head in the form of a turban,  from beneath which her dark eyes flashed with uncommon lustre. Her long  and tangled black hair fell in elf-locks from the folds of this singular  head-gear. Her attitude was that of a sibyl in frenzy, and she stretched  out in her right hand a sapling bough which seemed just pulled.    'I'll be d--d,' said the groom, 'if she has not been cutting the young  ashes in the dukit park!' The Laird made no answer, but continued to look  at the figure which was thus perched above his path.                'Ride your ways,' said the gipsy, 'ride your ways, Laird of Ellangowan;  ride your ways, Godfrey Bertram! This day have ye quenched seven smoking  hearths; see if the fire in your ain parlour burn the blyther for that.  Ye have riven the thack off seven cottar houses; look if your ain  roof-tree stand the faster. Ye may stable your stirks in the shealings at  Derncleugh; see that the hare does not couch on the hearthstane at  Ellangowan. Ride your ways, Godfrey Bertram; what do ye glower after our  folk for? There's thirty hearts there that wad hae wanted bread ere ye  had wanted sunkets, and spent their life-blood ere ye had scratched your  finger. Yes; there's thirty yonder, from the auld wife of an hundred to  the babe that was born last week, that ye have turned out o' their bits  o' bields, to sleep with the tod and the blackcock in the muirs! Ride  your ways, Ellangowan. Our bairns are hinging at our weary backs; look  that your braw cradle at hame be the fairer spread up; not that I am  wishing ill to little Harry, or to the babe that's yet to be born--God  forbid--and make them kind to the poor, and better folk than their  father! And now, ride e'en your ways; for these are the last words ye'll  ever hear Meg Merrilies speak, and this is the last reise that I'll ever  cut in the bonny woods of Ellangowan.'    So saying, she broke the sapling she held in her hand, and flung it into  the road. Margaret of Anjou, bestowing on her triumphant foes her  keen-edged malediction, could not have turned from them with a gesture  more proudly contemptuous."]]]
