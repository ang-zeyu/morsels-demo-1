Mohammed Aly wished to know my opinion respecting the number of troops  necessary for defending Egypt against a foreign army. I answered, that I  knew nothing of war, but from what I had read in books. No, no; he  exclaimed, you travellers always have your eyes open, and you inquire  after every thing. He persisted in his question; and being thus forced  to reply, I said that twenty-five thousand chosen troops would probably  be able to resist any attack. I have now thirty-three thousand, said  he--a false assertion, for I am quite certain that he had at that time  not more than sixteen thousand men, dispersed over Egypt and the Hedjaz.    He would next explain to me the Nizam Djedyd, or new system of  discipline and military regulations He said it was only the avidity of  the chiefs, and not the dislike of the common sol­diers, that obstructed  the institution of a well-organised army in Turkey, and opposed the  mustering necessary to prevent the officers from imposing on the public  treasury. But I shall make a regular corps of negro soldiers, he  added. This his predecessor Khurshid Pasha had attempted, but with  little success. The subject of the Nizam Djedyd was resumed as soon as  Mohammed Aly returned to Egypt from this expedition; but the revolt of  his soldiers, who plundered his own capital, obliged him to abandon the  undertaking, which had been badly planned. In the defence of Egypt, he  said, he should principally use his cavalry and horse­artillery; the  former should destroy all the provisions in advance of the enemy, as the  Russians had lately done; and the latter would harass them on all sides,  without ever attempting to make a stand.    [p.81] During my stay at Tayf, letters arrived from Constantinople,  across the Desert, by way of Damascus, bringing to the Pasha a Turkish  translation of the treaty of peace concluded at Paris. After having read  it several times, he ordered his Turkish writer to explain it to me in  Arabic, word for word. This occupied us in a private apartment several  hours. I then returned to the audience, and was desired by the Pasha to  tell him my opinion of the treaty. Referring to a Turkish atlas, copied  from European maps, and printed at Constantinople, he made me point out  to him the new limits of Belgium, the islands Mauritius and Tobago, the  position of Genoa, &c. &c. With respect to the latter place, a curious  mistake occurred. It had been stated to me that Genoa was ceded to the  Swedes, which I could not credit. Upon inquiry, I found that Geneva and  Switzerland were meant; a town and country which, I am sorry to say,  were not comprised in the geographical knowledge of a Turkish viceroy.  The mistake, how­ever, was easily made; for in Turkish, Geneva is  written like Genoua, and Sweden is pronounced Shwit.    The Pasha observed that much yet remained to be done, before all  differences between the parties could be settled; and I clearly saw how  impatiently he looked forward to a war among the European powers, which  would relieve him from any apprehensions for his own safety, and at the  same time occasion a great demand for corn at Alexandria.    With respect to Bonaparte, he seemed quite certain that the English  would one day seize him in Elba. Have the English, then, he exclaimed,  fought for nothing these twenty years? They have only got Malta, and a  few other islands! He was impressed with the fear that there were  secret articles in the peace, which assigned to them the possession of  Egypt. The notion of their having re-established the balance of power in  Europe, and secured their own safety and independence, did not enter  into his mind. They should not leave Spain, he continued, without    [p.82] being handsomely paid by the Spaniards; and why now abandon  Sicily? That the English were guided in their policy by the laws of  honour, and a sense of the general good of Europe, he could not  comprehend. A great king, he exclaimed, with much warmth, knows  nothing but his sword and his purse; he draws the one to fill the other;  there is no honour among conquerors!--a frank avowal of the sentiments  which guide even the most petty of the Turkish rulers.    Mohammed Aly had some notions of the English parliament; the name of  Wellington was familiar to him. He was a great general, he said; but  he doubted whether, if his Lordship had commanded such bad soldiers as  the Turkish troops are, he would have been able to do with them as much  as he (the Pasha) had done in conquering Egypt and the Hedjaz. He  betrayed great anxiety about the fate and future possession of Corfu and  the Seven Islands. On the one hand, he wished the Russians to make war  on the Porte, and to drive the Sultan out of Europe; on the other, he  feared that, if the Russians should seize Turkey in Europe, the English  would not remain quiet spectators, but would take their share of the  Turkish empire, which he was firmly persuaded would be no other than the  province of Egypt.    I am still ignorant of the Pashas real opinion concerning my sincerity  in professing the Mohammedan faith. He certainly treated me as a  muselman, and I flattered myself that the boldness of my conduct at Tayf  had convinced him that I was a true pro­selyte. As to the Kadhy, who was  a shrewd Constantinopolitan, most people supposed that the Porte had  sent him to watch the proceedings of Mohammed Aly, and give information  accordingly to the Sultan; and it struck me that his behaviour towards  myself was connected with an intention of accusing the Pasha, on his  return to Constantinople, of having protected a Christian in his visit  to the holy cities, a crime which would be considered unpar­donable in a  Pasha. Mohammed Aly, after his return to Cairo,    [p.83] (where, contrary to his expectations, he again found me, and  where I only saw him once,) took frequent opportunities, and indeed  seemed anxious, to convince Mr. Salt and Mr. Lee, His Majestys and the  Levant Companys consuls, as well as several English travellers of note  who passed through Cairo, that he knew per­fectly well, in the Hedjaz,  that I was no Moslem, but that his friendship for the English nation  made him overlook the circum­stance, and permit me to impose upon the  Kadhy. He entertained a notion, suggested to him by some of his Frank  counsellors at Cairo, that, in some future account of my travels, I  might perhaps boast of having imposed upon him, like Aly Bey el Abassi,  whose work had just been received at Cairo, and who declares that he  deceived not only the Pasha, but all the olemas, or learned men, of  Cairo. To Mohammed Aly it was of more consequence not to be thought a  fool than a bad muselman.    Notwithstanding these declarations of the Pasha to the English  gentlemen, which were made in private, and certainly were not occasioned  by any imprudent speeches of mine, I continued to live, after my return  to Cairo, without molestation, as a Moslem, in the Turkish quarter. I  have to thank him for his polite reception of me at Tayf, and for his  having thrown no obstacles in the way of my travels through the Hedjaz.    I was at Mekka in December, and at Medina in the April following, when  the Pasha was at both places; but I did not think it necessary or  advisable to wait upon him at either place, where I was otherwise wholly  unknown. My practice in travelling has been to live as retired as  possible; and, except during my short visit to Tayf, where circumstances  forced me to appear somewhat conspicuously, I was known only in the  Hedjaz as a hadjy, or pilgrim, a private gentleman from Egypt, one with  whom no person was acquainted but the few officers of the Pasha whom I  had seen at Tayf.    My information respecting Tayf is very scanty, and was not    [p.84] committed to paper until after I had left the town. I was never  suffered to be alone during my stay there. I had no acquaintances from  whom much could be learned; and during the fast of Ramadhan, few  individuals of the higher classes, among whom I lived, stir out of their  houses in the day-time.    The town of Tayf is situated in the midst of a sandy plain, about four  hours in circuit, overgrown with shombs, and encompassed by low  mountains, called Djebal Ghazoan. These are subordinate ridges of the  great chain, which, continuing for four or five hours farther east, are  then lost in the plain. Tayf is an irregular square, of thirty-five  minutes quick walking in circum­ference; it is inclosed with a wall and  a ditch, newly constructed by Othman el Medhayfe. The wall has three  gates, and is defended by several towers; but it is much less solid than  the walls of Djidda, Medina, and Yembo, being in few places more than  eighteen inches thick. On the west side, within the town, and forming a  part of its wall, stands the castle, upon a rocky elevated site. It was  built by Sherif Ghaleb, and has no claim to the title of a castle,  except that it is larger than the other buildings in the town, and that  its stone walls are stronger. Though it is now half ruined, Mohammed Aly  had made this castle his head­quarters. The houses of the town are  mostly small, but well built with stone: the sitting-rooms are on the  upper floor; at least I saw no saloons on the ground-floor, as usual in  Turkey. The streets are broader than those in most eastern towns. The  only public place is in front of the castle, a large open space which  serves for a market.    At present, Tayf may be described as in a state of ruin, for but few  houses are in complete repair. Many of the buildings were destroyed by  the Wahabys, when they took the town, in 1802; and as it has been almost  abandoned since that period, every thing is hastening to decay. I saw  two small mosques; the best, that of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#19)"],[1,"he had raised to greatness, and the men who looked to him  for guidance and direction.    Our story of his boyhood ends here. For years after he came to young  manhood fate seemed against him, and privation held him down. But he  broke loose from all entanglements; he surmounted all obstacles; he  conquered all adverse circumstances. He rose to power by his own  abilities. He led the armies of France to marvellous victories. He  became the idol of his soldiers, the hero of the people, the chief man  in the nation, the controlling power in Europe; and on the second of  December, in the year 1804, he was crowned in the great church of  Notre Dame, in Paris, Emperor of the French. \"Straw-nose,\" the  poverty-stricken little Corsican, had become the foremost man in all the  world!    But through all his marvellous career he never forgot his family. The  same love and devotion that he bestowed upon them when a poor boy and  a struggling lieutenant, he lavished upon them as general, consul,  and emperor. Indeed, to them was due, to a certain extent, his later  misfortunes, and his fall from power. The more generous he became, the  more selfish did his brothers and sisters grow. For their interests he  neglected his own safety and the welfare of France. His unselfishness  was, indeed, his greatest selfishness; and the boy who uncomplainingly  took his sister's punishment for the theft of the basket of fruit,  stood also as the scapegoat for all the mistakes and stupidities and  wrong-doings that were due to his self-seeking brothers and sisters, the  Bonaparte children of Ajaccio in Corsica.          CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.    BY THE WALL OF THE SOLDIERS' HOME.    The Emperor Napoleon had long been dead. A wasting disease and English  indignities had worn his life away upon his prison-rock of St. Helena;  and, after many years, his body had been brought back to France, and  placed beneath a mighty monument in the splendid Home for Invalid  Soldiers, in the beautiful city of Paris which he had loved so much, and  where his days of greatness and power had been spent.    There, beneath the dome, surrounded by all the life and brilliancy of  the great city, he rests. His last wish has been gratified--the wish he  expressed in the will he wrote on his prison-rock, so many miles away:  \"I desire that my ashes shall rest by the banks of the Seine, in the  midst of the French people I have loved so well.\"    That Home for Invalid Soldiers, in which now stands the tomb of  Napoleon, has long been, as its name implies, a home for the maimed and  aged veterans who have fought in the armies of France, and received as  their portion, wounds, illness,--and glory.    The sun shines brightly upon the walls of the great home; and the  war-worn veterans dearly love to bask in its life-giving rays, or to  rest in the shade of its towering walls.    It was on a certain morning, many years ago, that I who write these  lines--Eugenie Foa, friend to all the boys and girls who love to read of  glorious and heroic deeds--was resting upon one of the seats near to the  shade-giving walls of the Soldiers' Home. As I sat there, several of  the old soldiers placed themselves on the adjoining seat. There were a  half-dozen of them--all veterans, grizzled and gray, and ranging from  the young veteran of fifty to the patriarch of ninety years.    As is always the case with these scarred old fellows, their talk  speedily turned upon the feats at arms at which they had assisted.  And this dialogue was so enlivening, so picturesque, so full of the  hero-spirit that lingers ever about the walls of that noble building  which is a hero's resting-place, that I gladly listened to their talk,  and try now to repeat it to you.    \"But those Egyptians whom Father Nonesuch, here, helped to conquer,\" one  old fellow said,--\"ah, they were great story-tellers! I have read of  some of them in a mightily fine book. It was called the 'Tales of the  Thousand and One Nights.'\"    \"Bah!\" cried the eldest of the group. \"Bah! I say. Your 'Thousand and  One Nights,' your fairy stories, all the wonders of nature,\"--here he  waved his trembling old hand excitedly,--\"all these are but as nothing  compared with what I have seen.\"    \"Hear him!\" exclaimed the young fellow of fifty; \"hear old Father  Nonesuch, will you, comrades? He thinks, because he has seen the  republic, the consulate, the empire, the hundred days, the kingdom\"--    \"And is not that enough, youngster?\" interrupted the old veteran they  called Father Nonesuch.[1]          [1] Perhaps the correct rendering of this nickname would be        \"The Remnant,\" and it applies to the battered veteran even        better than \"Nonesuch.\"]    He certainly merited the nickname given him by his comrades; for I saw,  by glancing at him, that the old veteran had but one leg, one arm, and  one eye.    \"Enough?\" echoed the one called \"the youngster,\" whose grizzled locks  showed him to be at least fifty years old, \"Enough? Well, perhaps--for  you. But, my faith! I cannot see that they were finer than the 'Thousand  and one Nights.'\"    \"Bah!\" again cried old Nonesuch contemptuously; \"but those were fairy  stories, I tell you, youngster,--untrue stories,--pagan stories.  But when one can tell, as can I, of stories that are true,--of  history--history this--history that--true histories every one--bah!\"  and, shrugging his shoulders, old Nonesuch tapped upon his neighbor's  snuff-box, and, with his only hand, drew out a mighty pinch by way of  emphasis.    \"Well, what say thou, Nonesuch,--you and your histories?\" persisted the  young admirer of the \"Arabian Nights.\"    \"As for me,--my faith! I like only marvellous.\"    [Illustration: \"Beneath the great dome  he rests\"--The Hotel des Invalides (The 'Soldiers' Home' in Paris,  containing the Tomb of Napoleon)]    \"And I tell you this, youngster,\" the old veteran cried, while his voice  cracked into a tremble in his  excitement, \"there is more of the  marvellous in the one little finger of my history than in all the  characters you can crowd together in your 'Thousand and One Nights.'  Bah!--Stephen, boy; light my pipe.\"    \"And what is your history, Father Nonesuch?\" demanded \"the youngster,\"  while two-armed Stephen, a gray old \"boy\" of seventy, filled and lighted  the old veteran's pipe.    \"My history?\" cried old Nonesuch, struggling to his feet,--or rather to  his foot,--and removing his hat, \"it is, my son, that of the Emperor  Napoleon!\"    And at the word, each old soldier sprang also to his feet, and removed  his hat silently and in reverence.    \"Why, youngster!\" old Father Nonesuch continued, dropping again to the  bench, \"if one wished to relate about my emperor a thousand and one  stories a thousand and one nights; to see even a thousand and one days  increased by a thousand and one battles, adding to that a thousand and  one victories, one would have a thousand and a million million things  --fine, glorious, delightful, to hear. For, remember, comrades,\" and the  old man well-nigh exploded with his mathematical calculation, and the  grandeur of his own recollections, \"remember you this: I never left the  great Napoleon!\"    \"Ah, yes,\" another aged veteran chimed in; \"ah, yes; he was a great  man.\"    Old Nonesuch clapped his hand to his ear.    \"Pardon me, comrade the Corsican,\" he said, with the air of one who had  not heard aright; \"excuse my question, but would you kindly tell me whom  you call a great man?\"    \"Whom, old deaf ears? Why, the Emperor Napoleon, of course,\" replied the  Corsican.    Old Nonesuch burst out laughing, and pounded the pavement with his heavy  cane.    \"To call the emperor a man!\" he exclaimed; \"and what, then, will you  call me?\"    \"You? why, what should we?\" said the Corsican veteran; \"old Father  Nonesuch, old 'Not Entire,' otherwise, Corporal Francis Haut of  Brienne.\"    \"Ah, bah!\" cried the persistent veteran; \"I do not mean my name, stupid!  I mean my quality, my--my title, my--well--my sex,--indeed, what am I?\"  \"Well, what is left of you, I suppose,\" laughed the Corsican, \"we might  call a man.\"    \"A man! there you have it exactly!\" cried old Nonesuch. \"I am a man; and  so are you, Corsican, and you, Stephen, and you,--almost so,--youngster.  But my emperor--the Emperor Napoleon! was he a man? Away with you! It  was the English who invented that story; they did not know what he was  capable of, those English! The emperor a man? Bah!\"    \"What was he, then? A woman?\" queried the Corsican.    \"Ah, stupid one! where are your wits?\" cried old Nonesuch, shaking pipe  and cane excitedly. \"Are you, then, as dull as those English? Why, the  emperor was--the emperor! It is we, his soldiers, who were men.\"    The Corsican veteran shook his head musingly.    \"It may be so; it may be so, good Nonesuch. I do not say no to you,\" he  said. \"Ah, my dear emperor! I have seen him often. I knew him when he  was small; I knew him when he was grown. I saw him born; I saw him  die\"--\"Halt there!\" cried old Nonesuch; \"let me stop you once more,  good comrade Corsican. Do not make these other 'Not Entires' swallow  such impossible and indigestible things. The emperor was never born; the  emperor never died; the emperor has always been; the emperor always will  be. To prove it,\" he added quickly, holding up his cane, as he saw that  the Corsican was about to protest at this surprising statement, \"to  prove it, let me tell you. He fought at Constantine; he fought at St.  Jean d'Ulloa; he fought at Sebastopol, and was conqueror.\"    \"Come, come, Father Nonesuch!\" broke in \"the youngster,\" and others  of that group of veterans, \"you are surely wandering. It was not the  Emperor Napoleon who fought at those places. That was long after he was  dead. It was the son of Louis Philippe, the Duke of Nemours, who fought  at Constantine; it was the Prince of Joinville who led at Ulloa; and, at  Sebastopol, the\"--    [Illustration: \"_Pif! paf! pouf!
