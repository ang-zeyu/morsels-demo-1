The following is a copy of the  document:    Nauvoo, Ill., November 4, 1843.    Dear Sir.--As we understand you are a candidate for the presidency  at the next election, and as the Latter-day Saints (sometimes called  \"Mormons,\" who constitute a numerous class in the school politic of  this vast republic) have been robbed of an immense amount of property,  and endured nameless sufferings, by the State of Missouri, and from her  borders have been driven by force of arms, contrary to our national  covenants; and as in vain we have sought redress by all constitutional,  legal and honorable means, in her courts, her executive councils, and  her legislative halls; and as we have petitioned Congress to take  cognizance of our sufferings, without effect, we have judged it wisdom  to address you this communication, and solicit an immediate, specific  and candid reply to, What will be your rule of action relative to us as  a people, should fortune favor your ascension to the Chief Magistracy?    Most respectfully, sir, your friend, and the friend of peace, good  order and constitutional rights,    Joseph Smith,    In behalf of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    A copy of the above was sent to John C. Calhoun, Lewis Cass, Richard M.  Johnson, Henry Clay and Martin Van Buren.    After receiving their answers, he was so thoroughly disgusted with  their narrow, illiberal sentiments, that he published a manifesto, in  which he boldly expressed his \"VIEWS OF THE POWERS AND POLICY OF THE  GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\" a document well worthy the study of  the most erudite student of national policies.    At length, to the surprise and intense gratification of many of his  friends, Joseph Smith acceded to their repeated solicitations, and  consented to become a candidate for the presidency of the United States.    Those who best knew him--those who comprehended the depth of his  understanding, the greatness of his soul, the superhuman wisdom with  which he was endowed, the magnitude of his calling as the leader of  the dispensation of the fulness of times, and the mouthpiece of God to  this generation, considered it a marked condescension for him to be  willing to accept the position of President of the United States; while  those who, not having any personal acquaintance with him, had formed  their opinions by the scurrilous reports circulated about him, and only  knew of him as a base impostor--an ignorant leader of a poor, despised  people, designated it as one of the most absurd and even ludicrous of  all pretensions. The idea of \"old Jo Smith\" aiming at the highest gift  of the nation--\"the money digger\" assuming such prerogative, struck  them with as much astonishment, and was treated with as much derision  as though he had been one of Macbeth's ghosts.    But his friends were in earnest. They knew that through the revelations  of God he was in possession of higher intelligence, and more correct  understanding of national policies, and particularly the needs of our  own government as a republic, than any other man living. After he had  submitted himself to be announced as a candidate for the presidency, a  national convention assembled in Nauvoo, in which eighteen States were  represented.    Subsequently to this the Twelve (with the exception of Willard Richards  and John Taylor) and many other prominent Elders were sent to various  parts of the United States, which the following extract from Lorenzo's  journal will explain:    I was appointed to take the supervision of the political interests  of General Joseph Smith, as candidate for the presidential chair, in  Ohio, my native State. For this purpose I left Nauvoo, and proceeded  directly, by steamboat and stage, to the neighborhood of Kirtland, in  the northern part of the State, where I secured the printing of several  thousand pamphlets, setting forth his political views, suggestions,  propositions, etc., for distribution.    I then procured a horse and buggy, and traveled through the most  populous portions of the country, lecturing, canvassing, and  distributing pamphlets. Many people, both Saints and Gentiles, thought  this a bold stroke of policy; however, our own people generally, whom  I met, were quite willing to use their influence and devote their time  and energies to the promotion of the object in view.    I had a very interesting time--had many curious interviews, and  experienced many singular circumstances, on this my first and last  electioneering tour. To many persons who knew nothing of Joseph, but  through the ludicrous reports in circulation, the movement seemed a  species of insanity, while others, with no less astonishment, hailed  it as a beacon of prosperity to our national destiny. In the midst of  these extremes, my progress was suddenly brought to a close, by a well  confirmed report of the massacre of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum.    When this terrible news reached me, I was near Cincinnati, to which  place I immediately repaired, and found the Apostle, Amasa Lyman, who  had just arrived from Nauvoo with intelligence of the martyrdom, and  with counsel and instructions to the Saints and Elders.    The news of this sad event, of course, came wholly unexpected, and  struck me with profound astonishment and grief, which no language can  portray. As a partial expression of my thoughts and feelings, I quote  the following lines, written by my sister:    THE ASSASSINATION OF GENERALS JOSEPH SMITH AND HYRUM SMITH,    FIRST PRESIDENTS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,  WHO WERE MASSACRED BY A MOB, IN CARTHAGE, HANCOCK CO., ILL., ON THE  27TH OF JUNE, 1844.    And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls  of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony  which they held:    And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and  true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on  the earth?    And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said  unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their  fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they  were, should be fulfilled.--Rev., vi; 9, 10, 11.      Ye heavens, attend! Let all the earth give ear!    Let Gods and seraphs, men and angels hear:    The worlds on high--the universe shall know,    What awful scenes are acted here below!    Had Nature's self a heart, her heart would bleed    At the recital of so foul a deed;    For never, since the Son of God was slain,    Has blood so noble flowed from human vein,    As that which now on God for vengeance calls    From \"Freedom's\" ground--from Carthage prison walls.      Oh, Illinois! thy soil has drunk the blood    Of Prophets, martyred for the truth of God.    Once loved America! what can atone    For the pure blood of innocence thou'st sown?    Were all thy streams in teary torrents shed,    To mourn the fate of those illustrious dead,    How vain the tribute for the noblest worth,    That graced thy surface, O degraded earth!      Vile, wretched murderers, fierce for human blood,    You've slain the Prophets of the living God;    Who've borne oppression from their early youth,    To plant on earth, the principles of truth.      Shades of our patriot fathers! Can it be,    Beneath your blood-stained flag of liberty,    The firm supporters of our country's cause,    Are butchered while submissive to her laws?    Yes, blameless men, defamed by hellish lies,    Have thus been offered as a sacrifice,    T' appease the ragings of a brutish clan,    That has defied the laws of God and man!    'Twas not for crime or guilt of theirs, they fell:    Against the laws they never did rebel.    True to their country, yet her plighted faith    Has proved an instrument of cruel death.      Great men have fallen, mighty men have died--    Nations have mourned their fav'rites and their pride;    But, two so wise, so virtuous and so good,    Before on earth, at once, have never stood    Since the Creation--men whom God ordained,    To publish truth where error long had reigned;    Of whom the world itself unworthy proved;    It KNEW THEM NOT, but men with hatred moved,    And with infernal spirits have combined    Against the best--the noblest of mankind.      O, persecution! shall thy purple hand    Spread utter desolation through the land?    Shall Freedom's banner be no more unfurled?    Has peace, indeed, been taken from the world?      Thou God of Jacob, in this trying hour,    Help us to trust in Thy Almighty power--    Support the Saints beneath this awful stroke--    Make bare Thine arm to break oppression's yoke.    We mourn Thy Prophet, from whose lips have flowed    The words of life Thy Spirit has bestowed--    A depth of thought no human art could reach,    From time to time, flowed in sublimest speech,    From Thy celestial fountain, through his mind,    To purify and elevate mankind;    The rich intelligence by him brought forth,    Is like the sunbeam spreading o'er the earth.      Now Zion mourns--she mourns an earthly head;    Her Prophet and her Patriarch are dead;    The blackest deed that men and devils know,    Since Calv'ry's scene, has laid the brothers low.    _One_ while in life, and _one_ in death--they proved    How strong their friendship--how they truly loved;    True to their mission, until death they stood,    Then sealed their testimony with their blood.      All hearts with sorrow bleed, and every eye    Is bathed in tears; each bosom heaves a sigh;    Heart broken widows' agonizing groans    Are mingled with the helpless orphans' moans.      Ye Saints! be still, and know that God is just--    With steadfast purpose in His promise trust;    Girded with sackcloth, own His mighty hand,    And wait His judgments on this guilty land.    The noble Martyrs now have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#19)"],[1,"of the Mormons      in the state and the nation be diminished?' I inquired. 'Not in the      least; it would make them feel their persecution more than now and      cause them to have less faith in the fairness of the government.      They know the government cannot be fooled to any great extent and      that polygamy must go. Now that the tendency on the part of the      Mormons is to abandon polygamy, the purposes of the government in      making better Americans of the Mormon people than they are now      will be better subserved by allowing the influential men among      the Mormons to help the government bring about the desired end. I      say this with Senator Smoot in mind, and in view of the believed      fact among every class in Utah that he is not a polygamist. He      is one of the most level-headed business men in Utah, and is      exceedingly popular with all classes. Polygamy was deeply rooted.      The people for the most part were born in it. Why humiliate these      innocent victims by persecuting them unnecessarily when they show      an inclination to rid themselves and the county of the blot? The      United States is a conciliatory and humane government. I was born      in Russia and can appreciate this government. It is the kind of a      government that begets loyalty in its subjects. Will these erring      Children of Utah, who in all probability are not now contracting      any new polygamous marriages, be better citizens if they are      hounded and misrepresented by agitators, or if they are fairly      but firmly dealt with by the government and given a reasonable      chance to prove their good intentions and their good citizenship?      There is a very strong element throughout the county that takes      absolutely no stock in this ecclesiastical warfare that is being      made from Salt Lake City against the Mormons. It has been plainly      demonstrated very recently in the case of one minister here who      carried on a bitter crusade, that was worse than a waste of energy,      that such methods are re-active in the extreme.\"    BISHOP SCANLAN'S ATTITUDE.        \"That veteran old priest, Bishop Scanlan, who has charge of all of      Utah and the eastern half of Nevada for the Catholic church, has      visited every remote corner of Utah during the 30 years he has been      here. 'I have found the Mormon people a gentle and kindly disposed      people. I have never been insulted once. I have been obliged to      visit places where there are no hotels and wherever I have stopped      at private houses the people have always felt offended if I offered      to pay them for the keep of myself and my horse.' 'Have you ever      felt the need of a revolver?' I asked. 'I never owned one in my      life.' Pointing up to the crucifix, the bishop said: 'That is the      only weapon I have ever carried. The Catholic church has 10,000      communicants in Utah at the present time.' I do not see your name,      bishop, on protests and other papers that some of the ministers      here are active in circulating. 'No, I never join in anything of      that kind. My mission here is not to make war among the Mormon      people, or any other people, but rather to be the bearer of the      message of peace and good will toward all men. If there is any law      to be enforced, I leave that for my government to do.\"        VI.    \"HOW.\"    FOREWORD.    The subject treated under this title, \"How,\" is an address delivered  in the Salt Lake City Tabernacle on Sunday, May 31, 1903, in  one of the sessions of the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual  Improvement Associations Annual Conferences. The associations are  auxiliary organizations in the Church of the Latter-day Saints for  the improvement of the youth. In May of the above year, the General  Assembly of the Presbyterian Church was appointed to convene in Los  Angeles. A large number of ministers of this persuasion from eastern  states made it a point to pass through Salt Lake City _en route_ for  Los Angeles, and the Ministerial Association of Utah, an organization  comprised of Protestant ministers of all the Evangelical Churches  in the State, made it their business to call the attention of such  visiting ministers to the \"Mormon Question,\" and invited their  co-operation against the Mormon Church. As preliminary to this action  on their part they published two pamphlets, one under the title,  \"Claims of Mormons to be Considered Seriously.\" This pamphlet pretended  to give a brief history of the origin of the Mormon Church, and  declared that the Prophet Joseph Smith was considered by his neighbors  to be a character who was \"low, unworthy, of bad repute in general, and  that he was especially unworthy of confidence.\" It was a re-hash of the  silly stories that sprang up in western New York and that are utterly  unreliable, and which, while the Prophet lived in New York, could never  be established against him, though every possible effort to do so was  made.    The second pamphlet was entitled \"Temple Mormonism.\" The chief  purpose of this pamphlet was evidently to prove that Mormonism was an  oath-bound secret organization, \"for the encouragement and protection  of polygamous living.\" These pamphlets were distributed to the one  thousand Presbyterian ministers who are said to have passed through  Salt Lake at that time. It was the intention also to have them  presented to the Presbyterian Assembly in Los Angeles, and I believe  they were so presented. Later they were to be presented to the Baptist  Convention to be held that year in Buffalo, New York; also to the  Congregational Conference at Portland, Oregon, and then to the W. C.  T. U., to the Y. M. C. A. and W. C. A. conventions of that year; and  finally to the Inter-Denominational Association of Women. Whatever  became of the presentation of these pamphlets to the respective  organizations other than the Presbyterian Assembly, I do not know;  but their presentation to the gathered Presbyterian ministers at Los  Angels doubtless had the desired effect, for it resulted in some very  heated speeches upon the subject of Mormonism, more especially in one  delivered by Dr. Charles L. Thompson of New York, secretary of the  Assembly, who, in the course of a speech widely heralded through the  secular press of the country, said--and this was the report of the  speech according to the dispatches--of Mormonism:        \"It is not to be educated, not to be civilized, not to be      reformed--it must be crushed. No other organization is so perfect      as the Mormon Church except the German Army. This describes      Mormonism. Its empty promises deceive. Relentlessly it fastens its      victims in its loathsome glue. It has one vulnerable point. It is      not to be reformed. It is to be crushed. Dr. Richard L. Ely has      declared that there is nothing comparable to its system except the      German Army. * * * * Beware the Octopus. There is one moment in      which to seize it, says Victor Hugo. It is when it thrusts forth      its head. It has done it. Its high priest claims a senator's chair      in Washington. Now is the time to strike. Perhaps to miss it now is      to be lost.\"    Commenting on this speech, the dispatches said:        \"No speaker who has thus far appeared before the Presbyterian      General Assembly has aroused so much enthusiasm as Dr. Chas. L.      Thompson. His references to Mormonism were especially bitter, and      brought out great applause from his audience.\"    It is this speech that is commented upon in the remarks which follow.    HOW.    My Brethren and Sisters--I arise this afternoon to announce a great  disappointment. By reference to your printed programs you will see that  President Joseph F. Smith was chosen to make an address this afternoon,  but he insists upon my taking his place. I tried to dissuade him from  making the change, but he insisted upon it, and as he has the final  word in such matters, I respond cheerfully to his request, and ask you,  as soon as possible, to banish the remembrance of your disappointment  and assist me by your faith and prayers, that what I may say may be  fitting to this occasion, and prompted by the Spirit of the Lord.    I think I shall venture to take a text, but not from the Bible. My text  will be one that I have made \"out of my own head.\" Perhaps that will  account for its being so brief. It consists of one word only, and that  one word is, \"How?\"    Away back in 1832, on the occasion of a number of elders being  assembled in Kirtland, desiring to know the will of the Lord concerning  themselves, and in what manner they should spend their time pending  the commencement of a conference which had been called, the Lord said  through his Prophet:        \"I give unto you a commandment, that you shall teach one another      the doctrine of the kingdom; teach ye diligently, and my grace      shall attend you, that ye may be instructed more perfectly in      theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all      things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for      you to understand; of things both in heaven and in the earth, and      under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things      which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things      which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations,      and the judgments which are on the land, and a knowledge also of      countries and kingdoms, that ye may be prepared in all things when      I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have      called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.\"[A]    [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 88: 77-81.]    From this you will observe that the elders of the Church were commanded  to enter a very extensive field in search of knowledge. Indeed, I  cannot think of anything pertaining to things that lie within the"]]]
