Then came  Tiktok, and the Scarecrow with Billina perched upon his straw-stuffed  shoulder.  The twenty-seven officers and the private brought up the  rear.    As they reached the hall the doors flew open before them; but then they  all stopped and stared into the domed cavern with faces of astonishment  and dismay.  For the room was filled with the mail-clad warriors of the  Nome King, rank after rank standing in orderly array.  The electric  lights upon their brows gleamed brightly, their battle-axes were poised  as if to strike down their foes; yet they remained motionless as  statues, awaiting the word of command.    And in the center of this terrible army sat the little King upon his  throne of rock.  But he neither smiled nor laughed.  Instead, his face  was distorted with rage, and most dreadful to behold.          17.  The Scarecrow Wins the Fight      After Billina had entered the palace Dorothy and Evring sat down to  await the success or failure of her mission, and the Nome King occupied  his throne and smoked his long pipe for a while in a cheerful and  contented mood.    Then the bell above the throne, which sounded whenever an enchantment  was broken, began to ring, and the King gave a start of annoyance and  exclaimed, \"Rocketty-ricketts!\"    When the bell rang a second time the King shouted angrily, \"Smudge and  blazes!\" and at a third ring he screamed in a fury, \"Hippikaloric!\"  which must be a dreadful word because we don't know what it means.    After that the bell went on ringing time after time; but the King was  now so violently enraged that he could not utter a word, but hopped out  of his throne and all around the room in a mad frenzy, so that he  reminded Dorothy of a jumping-jack.    The girl was, for her part, filled with joy at every peal of the bell,  for it announced the fact that Billina had transformed one more  ornament into a living person.  Dorothy was also amazed at Billina's  success, for she could not imagine how the yellow hen was able to guess  correctly from all the bewildering number of articles clustered in the  rooms of the palace.  But after she had counted ten, and the bell  continued to ring, she knew that not only the royal family of Ev, but  Ozma and her followers also, were being restored to their natural  forms, and she was so delighted that the antics of the angry King only  made her laugh merrily.    Perhaps the little monarch could not be more furious than he was  before, but the girl's laughter nearly drove him frantic, and he roared  at her like a savage beast.  Then, as he found that all his  enchantments were likely to be dispelled and his victims every one set  free, he suddenly ran to the little door that opened upon the balcony  and gave the shrill whistle that summoned his warriors.    At once the army filed out of the gold and silver doors in great  numbers, and marched up a winding stairs and into the throne room, led  by a stern featured Nome who was their captain.  When they had nearly  filled the throne room they formed ranks in the big underground cavern  below, and then stood still until they were told what to do next.    Dorothy had pressed back to one side of the cavern when the warriors  entered, and now she stood holding little Prince Evring's hand while  the great Lion crouched upon one side and the enormous Tiger crouched  on the other side.    \"Seize that girl!\" shouted the King to his captain, and a group of  warriors sprang forward to obey.  But both the Lion and Tiger snarled  so fiercely and bared their strong, sharp teeth so threateningly, that  the men drew back in alarm.    \"Don't mind them!\" cried the Nome King; \"they cannot leap beyond the  places where they now stand.\"    \"But they can bite those who attempt to touch the girl,\" said the  captain.    \"I'll fix that,\" answered the King.  \"I'll enchant them again, so that  they can't open their jaws.\"    He stepped out of the throne to do this, but just then the Sawhorse ran  up behind him and gave the fat monarch a powerful kick with both his  wooden hind legs.    \"Ow!  Murder!  Treason!\" yelled the King, who had been hurled against  several of his warriors and was considerably bruised.  \"Who did that?\"    \"I did,\" growled the Sawhorse, viciously.  \"You let Dorothy alone, or  I'll kick you again.\"    \"We'll see about that,\" replied the King, and at once he waved his hand  toward the Sawhorse and muttered a magical word.  \"Aha!\" he continued;  \"NOW let us see you move, you wooden mule!\"    But in spite of the magic the Sawhorse moved; and he moved so quickly  toward the King, that the fat little man could not get out of his way.  Thump--BANG! came the wooden heels, right against his round body, and  the King flew into the air and fell upon the head of his captain, who  let him drop flat upon the ground.    \"Well, well!\" said the King, sitting up and looking surprised.  \"Why  didn't my magic belt work, I wonder?\"    \"The creature is made of wood,\" replied the captain.  \"Your magic will  not work on wood, you know.\"    \"Ah, I'd forgotten that,\" said the King, getting up and limping to his  throne.  \"Very well, let the girl alone.  She can't escape us, anyway.\"    The warriors, who had been rather confused by these incidents, now  formed their ranks again, and the Sawhorse pranced across the room to  Dorothy and took a position beside the Hungry Tiger.    At that moment the doors that led to the palace flew open and the  people of Ev and the people of Oz were disclosed to view.  They paused,  astonished, at sight of the warriors and the angry Nome King, seated in  their midst.    \"Surrender!\" cried the King, in a loud voice.  \"You are my prisoners.\"    \"Go 'long!\" answered Billina, from the Scarecrow's shoulder.  \"You  promised me that if I guessed correctly my friends and I might depart  in safety.  And you always keep your promises.\"    \"I said you might leave the palace in safety,\" retorted the King; \"and  so you may, but you cannot leave my dominions.  You are my prisoners,  and I will hurl you all into my underground dungeons, where the  volcanic fires glow and the molten lava flows in every direction, and  the air is hotter than blue blazes.\"    \"That will be the end of me, all right,\" said the Scarecrow,  sorrowfully.  \"One small blaze, blue or green, is enough to reduce me  to an ash-heap.\"    \"Do you surrender?\" demanded the King.    Billina whispered something in the Scarecrow's ear that made him smile  and put his hands in his jacket pockets.    \"No!\" returned Ozma, boldly answering the King.  Then she said to her  army:    \"Forward, my brave soldiers, and fight for your Ruler and yourselves,  unto death!\"    \"Pardon me, Most Royal Ozma,\" replied one of her generals; \"but I find  that I and my brother officers all suffer from heart disease, and the  slightest excitement might kill us.  If we fight we may get excited.  Would it not be well for us to avoid this grave danger?\"    \"Soldiers should not have heart disease,\" said Ozma.    \"Private soldiers are not, I believe, afflicted that way,\" declared  another general, twirling his moustache thoughtfully.  \"If your Royal  Highness desires, we will order our private to attack yonder warriors.\"    \"Do so,\" replied Ozma.    \"For-ward--march!\" cried all the generals, with one voice.  \"For-ward--march!\" yelled the colonels.  \"For-ward--march!\" shouted the  majors.  \"For-ward--march!\" commanded the captains.    And at that the private leveled his spear and dashed furiously upon the  foe.    The captain of the Nomes was so surprised by this sudden onslaught that  he forgot to command his warriors to fight, so that the ten men in the  first row, who stood in front of the private's spear, fell over like so  many toy soldiers.  The spear could not go through their steel armor,  however, so the warriors scrambled to their feet again, and by that  time the private had knocked over another row of them.    Then the captain brought down his battle-axe with such a strong blow  that the private's spear was shattered and knocked from his grasp, and  he was helpless to fight any longer.    The Nome King had left his throne and pressed through his warriors to  the front ranks, so he could see what was going on; but as he faced  Ozma and her friends the Scarecrow, as if aroused to action by the  valor of the private, drew one of Billina's eggs from his right jacket  pocket and hurled it straight at the little monarch's head.    It struck him squarely in his left eye, where the egg smashed and  scattered, as eggs will, and covered his face and hair and beard with  its sticky contents.    \"Help, help!\" screamed the King, clawing with his fingers at the egg,  in a struggle to remove it.    \"An egg! an egg!  Run for your lives!\" shouted the captain of the  Nomes, in a voice of horror.    And how they DID run!  The warriors fairly tumbled over one another in  their efforts to escape the fatal poison of that awful egg, and those  who could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#19)"],[1,"hours the six battleships, three to each  attack force, fired on the beaches. Since no specific targets could  be discerned or determined, the gunfire was directed at areas. Many  enemy supply dumps and minor military installations were destroyed. An  observer reported:          Gray smoke plumes are rising from the shores. Battleship      Mississippi is now working on the northern beaches. She is      joined by the Maryland whose fire has apparently caused a large      shore explosion. Jap ack-ack is fired at spotting planes but the      performance is weak.        Battleships move inshore and renew their constant      thunder. Helldivers and Avengers from our CVE's are heading toward      the shore.... [214]      At 0900 the battleships ceased their fire and the cruisers and  destroyers moved in closer to the shore to deliver their scheduled  bombardment. [215]    At 0850 gunfire was suspended in the vicinity of Catmon Hill,  the most prominent coastal terrain feature near Dulag, in order to  allow an air strike against installations in the interior by the  planes from the CVE's of the amphibious force. During the day a  total of 500 sorties by more than 140 planes were flown in direct  support. Twelve direct support missions were carried out, nine  against selected targets requested by ground troops and three against  targets of opportunity. Dawn and dusk fighter sweeps were made against  airfields. [216] The aircraft from the carriers, which were beyond the  range of the guns of enemy coastal defenses, did not attempt secondary  missions upon the completion of a mission in the target area. [217]    The principal bombing and strafing targets were revetments, dispersal  areas, supply dumps, and bivouac areas, together with aircraft on  islands near Leyte. Grounded planes were strafed and destroyed. The  commander of the escort carriers made the surprising estimate that  aircraft from his carriers had destroyed 125 planes on the ground  and damaged an additional 90 more in the first three days of this  \"close support at a distance.\" [218] Aircraft did not bomb the shore  line, since gunfire from the vessels within the gulf was considered  more effective.    At 0900 the cruisers commenced bombarding the beaches. They were joined  at 0930 by the destroyers. At 0945 the cruisers and destroyers lifted  their fire and directed it at the inland areas, at the flanks of the  landing beaches, and at important roads and towns. [219]    At 0800 the first anchor chains of the vessels had rattled out; LCVP's  were quickly swung over the sides; boats circled mother ships and moved  to their rendezvous areas. [220] The LCI mortar and LCI rocket ships  took their places at the head of the assault waves. It was now 0945,  fifteen minutes before H Hour. The LCI's raced simultaneously to the  shores of Leyte, raking the landing beaches with rocket and mortar  fire. The bombardment grew heavier and more monotonous. Hundreds of  small boats, flanked by rocket ships and destroyers, headed toward  the beaches; thousands of rockets hit the beaches with the rumble of  an earthquake. It was impossible to distinguish one explosion from  another in the unbroken roar. [221] Over a smooth sea a hot, brilliant,  tropical sun beat down. The American forces were ready to land.          X Corps Goes Ashore    Hours earlier reveille had sounded on board the transports and the  troops had dressed by the red lights in the holds where they were  quartered. There was very little talking. Many of the men sat on their  bunks giving their weapons a final check. Others lay back and smoked  in silence. A few sought the chaplains. [222]        Missions of Sixth Army Summarized    The Sixth Army had been ordered to seize and establish beachheads in  the Dulag and Tacloban areas and to secure the airfields in order to  provide naval and air bases; and to seize such objectives in the Panaon  Strait area as would permit safe passage of naval forces through the  strait to the Camotes Sea. [223] To carry out the operation General  Krueger had assigned the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry  Division, to gain control of Panaon Strait; the XXIV Corps was to  secure the Dulag area and its airstrip; and the 1st Cavalry Division  of X Corps was to land in the Marasbaras area and, by advancing north,  capture the Tacloban airdrome, the most important A-Day objective  for the Sixth Army. At the same time, the 24th Division, less the  21st Infantry, of the X Corps was to seize Palo and advance rapidly  to the northwest. [224] The seizure of these areas would secure the  important coastal airstrips for future air operations, cut off any  Japanese attempts at reinforcement from the southern Philippines  through the Mindanao Sea and Sogod Bay, secure the important eastern  entrances into the interior, and enable the American forces to control  San Pedro Bay and San Juanico Strait.    The northernmost unit of X Corps, the 1st Cavalry Division, was to  land in the vicinity of San Jose (also called San Ricardo and San Jose  Ricardo) about three miles north of Palo, on White Beach. White Beach  extended southward 2,000 yards from the Cataisan Peninsula. There  was an interval of 1,500 yards between this beach and the northern  limit of Red Beach, which was also 2,000 yards long. [225] The 24th  Division, less the 21st Infantry, was to land in the vicinity of the  town of Palo, on Red Beach. (Map 5)        1st Cavalry Division    White Beach had a fairly good landing surface of white coral sand,  but even at high tide it was suitable only for shallow-draft landing  craft. Its average width was fifteen yards at low tide, at which  time a small irregular bank two to three feet high appeared at the  water's edge. The underwater gradient was shallow, extending out  half a mile in places. An irregular fringe of coconut trees ran the  length of the beach. In the southern section this fringe was narrow,  with very wet and swampy cleared land behind it. Highway 1 roughly  paralleled the beach about a mile inland. [226]    The roar of many guns could be heard as the 1st Cavalry Division  prepared to disembark into landing boats, which were to rendezvous  at the line of departure 5,000 yards from shore. A pall of lazily  billowing yellow smoke obscured the shores of Leyte. [227]    The 1st Cavalry Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Verne D. Mudge,  was to land on White Beach with brigades abreast--the 1st Brigade  on the left (south) and the 2d Brigade on the right (north)--and  advance inland. The 1st Brigade, under Brig. Gen. William C. Chase,  was to reconnoiter the hills on the west side of Tacloban Valley  and establish observation posts which would command the entrances  to the valley. The 2d Brigade, under Brig. Gen. Hugh F. Hoffman, had  the most important mission of the day. It was to advance northwest,  capture the Tacloban airdrome and seize the Cataisan Peninsula,  reaching Cataisan Point, the northern extremity of the peninsula,  by 1400. Col. William J. Bradley's 8th Cavalry Regiment of the 2d  Brigade was held afloat in division reserve and was to be prepared  to reinforce either the 1st or 2d Brigade. [228]    Flanked by rocket and gunboat LCI's, and preceded by amphibian tanks,  the 5th and 12th Cavalry Regiments, which formed the 1st Brigade,  and the 7th Cavalry, which with the 8th Cavalry (in reserve) composed  the 2d Brigade, raced for the shores of Leyte. The escorting rocket  ships laid down a heavy barrage which covered the beach defenses  to a depth of 1,800 yards inland and left the enemy incapable of  organized resistance. As the boats neared shore, only small arms and  machine gun fire opposed the landing. [229] As planned, the regiments  landed abreast, the 7th Cavalry Regiment on the right (north), the  12th Cavalry Regiment in the center, and the 5th Cavalry on the left  (south).    The 1st Squadron of the 7th Cavalry was to land north of the 2d  Squadron on the northern end of White Beach, which at this point  coincided with the narrow neck of land connecting the Cataisan  Peninsula to the rest of the island, and then go directly north to  secure the entire peninsula and the airstrip. On its left the 2d  Squadron, 7th Cavalry, was to land on the right flank of White Beach,  push inland, capture San Jose and a bridge across the Burayan River  northwest of the town, and seize a beachhead line a thousand yards  west of Highway 1 and three thousand yards from White Beach. The  Cataisan Peninsula would then be sealed off.    Both squadrons landed on schedule, with only slight opposition,  and immediately began to execute their assignments. The 2d Squadron,  within fifteen minutes after landing, knocked out two pillboxes on the  beach, killing eight Japanese in one and five in the other. It then  organized rapidly and pushed on to secure its first objective, the  town of San Jose. In the town the squadron engaged in a house-to-house  search but found few Japanese. By 1230 twenty-four Japanese had been  killed, San Jose was in American hands, and the Cataisan Peninsula  was sealed off. The 7th Cavalry Regiment established its command post  on the west side of the town at 1245. The troops of the 2d Squadron  then set out in a northwesterly direction astride the hard-surfaced,  narrow San Jose-Tacloban road, but they were slowed down by swamps  and flooded rice paddies on either side. [230] At 1400 they crossed  the Burayan River on a bridge which the 33d Infantry Regiment had  attempted to destroy but had only damaged. The engineers strengthened  the bridge so that the medium tanks could cross, and at 1420 the  forward movement continued. By 1630 the squadron had reached its  objective--a point 3,000 yards from White Beach--and immediately set  up its night perimeter.    The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, landed in amphibian tractors on the  north end of White Beach a few minutes after initial assault waves of  the 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, had cleared the"]]]
