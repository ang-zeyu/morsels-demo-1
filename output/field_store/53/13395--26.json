I was able  to get his sweater, a big help in keeping the cold out. Usual deaths.  The count, (?) 650.    Jan. 23, 1945: Extremely cold; had been snowing all night. Col. Shock,  Dental Officer, died in our bay. He had been very bitter. He thought  the doctors had not given him the proper care. He could not have been  more right! Other friends dying: Cmdr. Josses, USN medic, Maj. Horace  Greely, Capt Kornblum, Army dentist. The count, (?) 620.    Jan. 24, 1945: Snowing and bitter cold. The ship was making very poor  time; life was slowly ebbing away.    Jan. 25, 1945: Extremely cold! Col. Fred Saint of the Army Engineer  Corps died. He had been wounded in the Jan. 9th bombing. One-quarter  cup of rice; six spoons of water.    Jan. 26, 1945: Coooold! Many have died! There were only three  chaplains alive of twenty-three starting the trip. The medical service  had completely evaporated. Major \"Mac\" Williams was the only medic  still on his feet.    We passed another convoy going south. One-quarter cup of rice; no  water! The count, (?) 555.    Jan. 27th: Anchored all day! Any chance of survival is slowly slipping  away. I was so weak, it was impossible to move around. Snow covered  islands around us were beautiful. One-quarter cup of rice; six spoons  of water. The count, (537).    Jan. 28th: We were underway at dawn; many depth charges had been  dropped during the night. One-quarter cup of rice; no water! The  count, (?) 517.                                    Chapter X                                    JAPAN!      Jan. 29, 1945: Anchored at dawn in the harbor of Moji on the most  southerly island of Japan, Kyushu. One-quarter cup of rice twice  during day; six teaspoons of water. The count, (?) 497.    1129 had died since we departed from Manila on December 13th, 1944, an  average of twenty-four deaths each day; 463 had    died since we left Takao Harbor on Formosa on Jan. 14, 1945, an  average of thirty deaths each day.    Jan. 30, 1945: We were issued cotton army clothing and tennis shoes. A  senior Japanese officer boarded the ship after observing the  debilitated prisoners; lingering close to death; he slapped Lt.  Toshino and Mr. Wata.    The surviving derelicts teetering between life and death, attempted to  climb the ladder to the snow covered deck of the Enoura Maru.    As we debarked in six inches of snow and 20 deg.F., masked Japanese  soldiers in white gowns sprayed us with a carbolic acid solution,  adding to our misery.    Eventually, those prisoners who could still stand up were divided into  3 groups:      Group I: 100 prisoners to Camp 3 (Tobato).    Group II: 192 prisoners to Camp 1 (Kashi).    Group III: 95 prisoners to Camp 17 (Omuta).    Group IV (the hospital group): 110 prisoners - unable to walk, sat or  lay in the snow all day. I tried to get a drink of water, but found  the faucets frozen. In desperation, I ate snow.      About 2100, five small charcoal-burning ambulances arrived. Twenty two  Americans were crowded into each ambulance.                     Japanese Prisoner of War Hospital - Moji    We turned into a gateway and were promptly challenged by a Jap sentry.  After several minutes of excited guttural grunts and groans, we moved  into the compound and were unloaded. Our new home was a low and flimsy  frame building without heat. Inside, we were assigned straw mats on  the floor, and were quickly under six cotton blankets and still cold.  Each received a small binto box containing rice and salty fish. I  tried to sleep, but couldn't. All of the events of the last seven  weeks were vividly going through my mind.    Feb. 2, 45: My friend, Chaplain Ed Nagel, the missionary from Baguio,  died. He had gradually grown weaker following his wound in the thigh  on Dee. 14th, 1944 until he passed away in his sleep. I had just lost  my good \"Buddy\" he had been an excellent friend; I would miss Ed.       Feb. 3, 45: Many patients were dying; the Japs told us they had  ordered Red Cross packages, but they never arrived.       Joe Ganahl, the Northern Luzon Force, told me, \"I feel as weak as a  kitten!\" and proceeded to lay down and die.       The food set-up was going from bad to worse. Half-cup of soup twice  daily. Wt. 80 lbs.    Feb. 13, 45: Severe pains in my legs and feet. Could be beriberi,  vascular disease or frost bite, or all three. Believed gangrene was  setting in.    Feb. 16,45: Awakened, no feeling in my feet at all. Believed the end  must be near. Wrote Judy a final note, telling her I loved her and  didn't want to leave her. I gave the note to Chaplain Taylor to be  delivered after the war.    The following days were very painful.    Mar. 1, 45: Loaded into charcoal-burning ambulances and taken to the  railroad station. Spent the day riding on coaches, arriving at our  destination about dark.                                 Fukuoka Camp #22      Walked up a steep hill for half a mile, hanging heavily on an  agreeable Jap guard. Greeted by jolly Australian prisoners; their  language was very \"bloody,\" but they were good guys, serving us hot  soup and Red Cross coffee, saved from their own rations. They got us  blankets and hot water bottles.       Mar. 2, 45: The Aussies took us down to the Jap pool (a 15' x 15'  vat), and gave a hot bath-and washed our lousy clothes.    Mar. 15, 45: Now only 34 of our original hospital group alive. Air  raids becoming very frequent, especially at night; there were sirens  in many directions. We could hear high-flying planes; in the distance  we could hear heavy bombing. Food was becoming very scarce. The 'In  Charge' came by and told me: \"You have given up; you are yellow; get  up and walk around!\"    It made me mad probably just what I needed.    April 1, 45: I seemed a little stronger; could take several steps, but  each step caused much \"bloody\" pain. The American patients    are all confined to bed. wt. 90 lbs.    Aussies give us our weekly baths, the highlight of each week.       My skin was rough and scaly - pellagra; my feet were numb and  swollen - beriberi. I had lost much of my body hair. My beard,  normally heavy, was thin and silky - probably due to changes in the  sex hormones.       April 10, 45: Air raids frequent and heavy; cities being badly  crippled. Everybody was jittery. The skimpy meals; very irregular.    April 12, 45: With help of Dudley Wilkinson of Australia, I was  learning to walk, much like a baby. It caused much pain in every  muscle moved. Ten steps and I was exhausted.    Apr. 25, 45: The 24 remaining patients and several guards were loaded  on a truck. We passed through beautiful mountain country; people were  working their small farms. Arrived at the Port of Fukuoka about noon.  Other groups of Americans were coming in; I could see Major John  Raulston and Lt. George Chamberlain.    About dark each group was marched to a pier; waiting a couple hours we  boarded a rather streamlined 2 stack cruiser. I was carried one deck  below and laid on a mat. The warmth of the cabin was very welcome.  Major \"Mac\" Williams gave me an injection. Later, he told me he  thought I was dying.       Major Tom Smothers, on the litter next to me, died. He was the  father of Tommy and Dick Smothers, the comedians.       Apr. 26, 45: Arrived in Pusan, Korea in the afternoon. Carried  about a mile to a theater, where we spent the night. Tenko 334.    Apr. 27, 45: About 0800, our group was marched (I was carried by a  British prisoner) to the rail station. We were soon aboard a second  class coach.    Was given a binto box: rice and very salty fish, causing great thirst.  Chinese men were sleeping all over the coach: floor, seats and even  luggage racks. Korea was mountainous and beautiful; many trees and  plants were in bloom.    Passed the Yalu River - very muddy as it flowed into the Yellow Sea.    Apr. 29, 45: Arrived in Mukden, Manchuria (over a million population).  (The Manchu's once conquered and ruled the vast Chinese Empire, having  overthrown the Ming Dynasty and set up the Ch'ing Dynasty, from which  the name China evolved. During this period, the Great Wall was built).                                  Chapter XI                        Camp Hoten, Mukden, Manchuria        I was carried to the prison hospital. This was the Emperor of Japan's  birthday. We each received a cookie. At one end of the ward was a  large cylindrical Russian stove; we received one scuttle of coal per  day; when it was gone, we froze.       Mukden was extremely cold; had only two seasons: winter and the  Fourth of July. Piled the blankets over my head and shivered.    Another problem; the air was very dry; our noses became irritated and  uncomfortable. Old timers threw pails of water on the floors, putting  moisture back into the air.    From the second floor, we could see over the high stone wall; we were  in a factory area. The healthy prisoners had to work in the  neighboring factories, making munitions, tools and rope. When they  would return each night, we got the latest rumors from the Chinese  workers: \"Mussolini had been hung!\"       In Mukden we felt isolated from the rest of the world and even the  war; it wasn't all bad!    Capt. Herbst of Canton, Ohio, our medic, and the Japanese doctor, Juro  Oki of Tokyo, got me small amounts of dysentery medicine.    The first weeks in the hospital were spent hibernating, trying to gain  strength. I was extremely fortunate to have a good friend, Major  (Honest John) Raulston, from Richard City, Tennessee, who helped me in  many ways, while I was incapacitated. .       May 7, 45: My weight was up to 100 lbs. Discharged from the  hospital.       Major Stanley Hankins was American C.O. of the Camp, and Col.  Matsuda, the Japanese C.O. He ran one of the better camps.       May 10, 45: My fortieth birthday; I was ready for \"Life to Begin!\"  Wt. 103 lbs.

Contrary to the accepted  belief, it appears here also that the absorption on the whole grows less  and less, to the extreme infra-red extremity; and on the other hand,  that the energy before absorption was so enormously greater in the blue  and violet, that the sun must have a decidedly bluish tint to the naked  eye, if we could rise above the earth's atmosphere to view it.    But even were we placed outside the earth's atmosphere, that surrounding  the sun itself would still remain, and exert absorption. By special  methods, not here detailed, we have at Alleghany compared the  absorption, at various depths, of the sun's own atmosphere for each  spectral ray, and are hence enabled to show, with approximate truth, I  think for the first time, the original distribution of energy throughout  the visible and invisible spectrum at the fount of that energy, in the  sun itself. There is a surprising similarity, you will notice, in the  character of the solar and telluric absorptions, and one which we could  hardly have anticipated _a priori_.    Here, too, violet has been absorbed enormously more than the green, and  the green than the red, and so on, the difference being so great, that  if we were to calculate the thickness of the solar atmosphere on the  hypothesis of a uniform transmission, we should obtain a very thick  atmosphere from the rate of absorption in the infra-red alone, and a  very thin one from that in the violet alone.    But the main result seems to be still this, that as we have seen in the  earth's atmosphere, so we see in the sun's, an enormous and progressive  increase of the energy toward the shorter wave-lengths. This conclusion,  which, I may be permitted to remark, I anticipated in a communication  published in the _Comptes Rendus_ of the Institute of France as long  since as 1875, is now fully confirmed, and I may mention that it is so  also by direct photometric methods, not here given.    If, then, we ask how the solar photosphere would appear to the eye,  could we see it without absorption, these figures appear to show  conclusively that it would be _blue_. Not to rely on any assumption,  however, we have, by various methods at Allegheny, reproduced this  color.    Thus (to indicate roughly the principle used), taking three Maxwell's  disks, a red, green, and blue, so as to reproduce white, we note the  three corresponding ordinates at the earth's surface spectrum, and,  comparing these with the same ordinates in the curve giving the energy  at the solar surface, we rearrange the disks, so as to give the  proportion of red, green, and blue which would be seen _there_, and  obtain by their revolution a tint which must approximately represent  that at the photosphere, and which is most similar to that of a blue  near Fraunhofer's \"F.\"    The conclusion, then, is that, while all radiations emanate from the  solar surface, including red and infra-red, in greater degree than we  receive them, the blue end is so enormously greater in proportion that  the proper color of the sun, as seen at the photosphere is blue--not  only \"bluish,\" but positively and distinctly blue; a statement which I  have not ventured to make from any conjecture, or on any less cause than  on the sole ground of long continued experiments, which, commenced some  seven years since, have within the past two years irresistibly tended to  the present conclusion.    The mass of observations on which it rests must be reserved for more  detailed publication elsewhere. At present, I can only thank the  association for the courtesy which has given me the much prized  opportunity of laying before them this indication of methods and  results.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MINERALOGICAL LOCALITIES IN AND AROUND NEW YORK CITY, AND THE  MINERALS OCCURRING THEREIN.    [Footnote: Continued from SUPPLEMENTS 244 and 246.]    By NELSON H. DABTON.    PART III.      Hoboken.--The locality represented here is where the same serpentine  that we met on Staten Island crops out, and is known as Castle Hill. It  is a prominent object in view when on the Hudson River, lying on Castle  Point just above the Stevens Institute and about a mile north of the  ferry from Barclay or Christopher Street, New York city. Upon it is the  Stevens estate, etc., which is ordinarily inaccessible, but below this  and along the river walk, commencing at Fifth Street and to Twelfth,  there is an almost uninterrupted outcrop from two to thirty feet in  thickness and plentifully interspersed with the veins of the minerals  of the locality, which are very similar to those of Staten Island; the  serpentine, however, presenting quite a different appearance, being of a  denser and more homogeneous structure and color, and not so brittle or  light colored as that of Staten Island, but of a pure green color. The  veins of minerals are about a half an inch to--in the case of druses  of magnesite, which penetrate the rock in all proportions and  directions--even six inches in thickness. They lie generally in a  perpendicular position, but are frequently bent and contorted in every  direction. They are the more abundant where the rock is soft, as veins,  but included minerals are more plentiful in the harder rock. There is  hardly any one point on the outcrop that may be said to be favored in  abundance, but the veins of the brucites, dolomite, and magnesites are  scattered at regular and short intervals, except perhaps the last, which  is most plentiful at the north end of the walk.    _Magnesite_.--This mineral, of which we obtained some fine specimens on  Staten Island, occurs extremely plentifully here, constituting five or  six per cent. of a large proportion of the rock, and in every imaginable  condition, from a smooth, even, dark colored mass apparently devoid of  crystalline form, to druses of very small but beautiful crystals, which  are obtained by selecting a vein with an opening say from a quarter to a  half-inch between it and one or, if possible, both points of its contact  with the inclosing rock, and cutting away the massive magnesite and rock  around it, when fine druses and masses or geodes may be generally found  and carefully cut out. The crystals are generally less than a quarter of  an inch long, and the selection of a cabinet specimen should be based  more upon their form of aggregation that the size of the crystals.  Nearly all the veins hold more or less of these masses through their  total extent, but many have been removed, and consequently a careful  search over the veins for the above indications, of which there are  still plenty undeveloped or but partly so, would well repay an hour  or more of cutting into, by the specimens obtained. Patience is an  excellent and very necessary virtue in searching for pockets of  minerals, and is even more necessary here among the multitudinous barren  veins. One hint I might add, which is of final importance, and the  ignorance of which has so far preserved this old locality from  exhaustion, is that every specimen of this kind in the serpentine, of  any great uniqueness, is to be found within five feet from the upper or  surface end of the vein, which in this locality is inaccessible in the  more favored parts without a ladder or similar arrangement upon which  one may work to reach them. Here the veins will be found to be very far  disintegrated and cavernous, thus possessing the requisite conditions of  occurrence (this is also true of Staten Island, but there more or less  inaccessible) for this mineral and similar ones that occur in geodes or  drused incrustations, while it is just _vice versa_ for those occurring  in closely packed veins, as brucite, soapstone, asbestos, etc., where  they occur in finer specimens, where they are the more compact, which is  deep underground. This is also partly true of the zeolites and granular  limestone species with included minerals. I do not think there is any  rule, at least I have not observed it in an extended mineralogical  experience; but if they favor any part, it is undoubtedly the top, as  in the granular limestone and granite; however, they generally fall  subordinate to the first principle, as they more frequently, in this  formation, with the exception of chromic iron, occur not in the  serpentine but in the veins therein contained; for instance, crystals  of dolomite are found deeper in the rock as they occur in the denser  soapstone, which becomes so at a more or less considerable depth, with  spinel, zircon, etc., of the granular limestone. They occur generally in  pockets within five feat from the surface, but they can hardly be called  included minerals, as they are rather, as their mention suggests,  pockets, and adjacent or in contact with the intruded granite or  metamorphosed rock joining the formation at this point. This is  seemingly at variance when we consider datholite, but when we do find it  in pockets a hundred and fifty feet below the surface, in the Weehawken  tunnel, it is not in the trap, but on the surface of what was a cleft  or empty vein, since filled up with chlorite extending from the surface  down, while natrolite, etc., by the trap having clefts of such variable  and often great depth, allowed the solution of the portion thus  contributed that infiltered from the surface easy access to the beds  in which they lie, the mode of access being since filled with densely  packed calcite, which was present in over-abundance. This is not "]]]
