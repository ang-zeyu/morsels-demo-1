Our lady says that  at all times two of you must remain here, as it may be necessary to send  messages, or should she wish to go out, to escort her, but the other two  can be out and about as they please, after first inquiring of me whether  there is aught for them to do. You can arrange among yourselves which  shall stay in, taking turns off duty. Tom, you had better not go out till  after dark. There is something in the cut of your garments which tells  that you are not French. Robert will go out with me now, and find a  clothier, and bid him send garments here for you to choose from, or if he  has none to fit, which may likely enough be, send him to measure you. It  might lead to broils and troubles were any of the rabble to notice that  you were a stranger.\"    \"That is right enough, Master Guy; and in sooth I have no desire to go out  at present, for after riding for the last six days I am well content to  sit quiet and take my ease here.\"    Guy then started with Robert Picard. Except in the streets where the  principal merchants dwelt, the town struck him as gloomy and sombre. The  palaces of the nobles were veritable fortresses, the streets were ill-paved and evil-smelling, and the people in the poorer quarters had a  sinister aspect.    \"I should not care to wander about in this district after nightfall,  Robert,\" Guy said to the man-at-arms, who kept close to his elbow.    \"Nor I,\" the man growled. \"It is as much as I can do to keep my hands off  my dagger now, for methinks that nine out of ten of the fellows loitering  about would cut our throats willingly, if they thought that we had but a  crown in our pockets.\"    Presently they found themselves on the quays, and, hailing a boat, rowed  up the river a little beyond the walls. Hearing the sound of music they  landed, and on seeing a number of people gather round some booths they  discharged the boat and went on. They found that it was a sort of fair.  Here were sword-players and mountebanks, pedlars who vended their wares at  a lower price than those at which they were sold within the limits of the  city, booths at which wine and refreshments could be obtained. Here many  soldiers were sitting drinking, watching the passers-by, and exchanging  ribald jests with each other, and sometimes addressing observations to the  wives and daughters of the citizens, amid fits of laughter at the looks of  indignation on the part of their husbands or fathers.    \"It is evidently a holiday of some sort,\" Guy remarked, as they found that  the fair extended for a considerable distance, and that the crowd was  everywhere large. They stopped for a minute or two in front of a booth of  more pretensions than the generality. In front of it a man was beating a  drum, and a negro walking up and down attired in showy garments. The drum  ceased and the latter shouted:    \"Those of you who wish to see my master, the famous Elminestres, the most  learned doctor in Europe, who can read the stars, cast your horoscope,  foretell your future, and cure your ailments, should not lose this  opportunity.\"    The curtains opened behind, and a man dressed in dark garments with a long  black cloak spotted with silver stars came forward.    \"You have heard, good people, what my slave has said. He speaks with  knowledge. I saved his life in the deserts of Africa when he was all but  dead with fever, by administering to him one of my wonderful potions; he  at once recovered and devoted himself to my service. I have infallible  remedies for every disease, therefore do you who are sick come to me and  be cured; while for you who do not suffer I can do as much or more, by  telling you of your future, what evils to avoid and what chances to  grasp.\"    He stood for a minute silent, his eyes wandering keenly over the  spectators. \"I see,\" he said, \"one among you who loves a fair maiden  standing beside him. At present her parents are unfavourable to his suit,  but if he will take my advice he will be able to overcome their objections  and to win the damsel. Another I see who has come to Paris with the  intention of enlisting in the service of our good duke, and who, I  foresee, will attain rank and honour and become a distinguished soldier if  he does but act prudently at the critical moment, while if he takes a  wrong turn misfortune and death will befall him. I see a youth of gentle  blood who will become a brave knight, and will better his condition by  marriage. He has many dangers to go through before that, and has at  present a serious charge for one so young; but as he has circumspection as  well as courage he may pass through them unharmed. To him too I could give  advice that may be valuable, more especially as he is a stranger to the  land, as are those of whom he is in charge.\"    \"It is wonderful, Master Guy!\" Robert Picard whispered in Guy's ear in a  tone of astonished awe.    \"The knave doubtless saw us ride in this morning, and recognized me again.  There is naught of magic in it, but the fellow must be shrewd, or he would  not have so quickly drawn his conclusions. I will go in and speak to him  presently, for though I believe not his prophecies one jot, a fellow of  this sort may be useful. Let us be moving on at present.\"    They passed two monks, who were scowling angrily at the man, who was just  exciting the laughter of the crowd by asserting that there was a holy man  present who usually preferred a flask of good wine to saying his vespers.    \"Rogues like this should be whipped and branded, Brother Anselmo.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" the other agreed: \"and yet,\" he added slyly, \"it may be that he  has not altogether missed his mark this time. We are not the only two  monks here,\" he went on as the other turned upon him angrily, \"and it may  well be that among them is one who answers to the fellow's lewd  description.\"    On the outskirts of the fair were many people of higher degree. Knights  and ladies strolled on the turf exchanging greetings, looking for a minute  or two at the gambols of a troupe of performing dogs, or at a bout of  cudgel play--where two stout fellows belaboured each other heartily, and  showed sufficient skill to earn from the crowd a shower of small pieces of  money, when at last they ceased from pure exhaustion. Half an hour later  Guy returned to the booth of the doctor, and went in by a side entrance,  to which those who wished to consult the learned man had been directed by  the negro. The latter was at the entrance, and, observing that Guy's  condition was above that of the majority of his master's clients, at once  took him into an inner apartment divided from the rest of the tent by a  hanging. Over the top of this was stretched a black cloth spotted with  silver stars, and similar hangings surrounded it; thus all light was cut  off, and the room was dimly illuminated by two lamps. A table with a black  cloth stood at the back. On this stood a number of phials and small boxes,  together with several retorts and alembics. The doctor was seated on a  tripod stool. He rose and was about to address Guy in his usual style,  when the latter said:    \"So you saw us ride in this morning, Master Doctor, and guessed shrewdly  as to our condition and nationality. As to the latter, indeed, it needed  no sorcery, for it must have been plain to the dullest that my mistress  and her daughter were not of French blood, and though I am much less fair,  it was a pretty safe guess to suppose that I also was of their country. I  need not tell you that I have not come here either for charms or nostrums,  but it seemed to me that being, as you said, strangers here, we might  benefit by the advice of one who like yourself notes things quickly, and  can form his own conclusions.\"    The doctor removed his tall conical cap, and placed it on the table.    \"You guess rightly,\" he said with a smile. \"I was in the crowd and marked  you enter, and a soldier standing next to me observed to a comrade that he  had heard that Burgundy had sent the herald to demand the surrender of a  castle held by one Sir Eustace, a knight who was known to have friendly  leanings towards the English, being a vassal of their king for estates  that had come to him with an English wife, and that doubtless this was the  lady. When my eye fell on you in the crowd I said: Here is a youth of  shrewdness and parts, he is alone and is a foreigner, and maybe I can be  of service to him; therefore I shot my shaft, and, as you see, with  success. I said to myself: This youth, being a stranger, will know of no  one to whom he can turn for information, and I can furnish him with almost  any that he may require. I come in contact with the highest and the  lowest, for the Parisians are credulous, and after dark there are some of  rank and station who come to my doors for filtres and nostrums, or to have  their horoscope cast and their futures predicted. You will ask why one who  has such clients should condescend to stand at a booth and talk to this  rabble; but it has its purpose. Were I known only as one whom men and  women visit in secret, I should soon become suspected of black arts, the  priests would raise an outcry against me, and one of these days I might be  burned. Here, however, I ostensibly earn my living as a mountebank vendor  of drugs and nostrums, and therefore no one troubles his head about me.\"    \"There is one thing that you have not told me,\" Guy said when he ceased  speaking. \"Having, as you say, good clients besides your gains here, why  should you trouble to interest yourself in our affairs?\"    \"Shrewdly put, young sir. I will be frank with you. I too am a stranger,  and sooner or later I may fall into discredit, and the power of the church  be too much for me. When I saw your mistress to-day I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#19)"],[1,"or Cambridge man, or an old sailor came  along--it might put years on to his life to have a pull at the oars. You  remember that old sailor we saw in charge of the engine back there at  the government tank? You saw how he had the engine?--clean and bright as  a new pin--everything spick-and-span and shipshape, and his hut fixed up  like a ship's cabin. I believe he thinks he's at sea half his time, and  shoving her through it, instead of pumping muddy water out of a hole in  the baking scrubs for starving stock. Or maybe he reckons he's keeping  her afloat.\"    \"And would you have fish in this lake of yours?\" I asked.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Mitchell, \"and any ratty old shepherd or sundowner,  that's gone mad of heat and loneliness--like the old codger we met back  yonder--he could sit by the lagoon in the cool of the evening and fish  to his heart's content with a string and a bent pin, and dream he's  playing truant from school and fishing in the brook near his native  village in England about fifty years ago. It would seem more real than  fishing in the dust as some mad old bushmen do.\"    \"But you'd draw the line somewhere?\" I asked.    \"No,\" said Mitchell, \"not even at poets. I'd try to cure them, too, with  good wholesome food and plenty of physical exercise. The Lost Souls'  Hotel would be a refuge for men who'd been jail-birds once as well  as men who were gentlemen once, and for physical wrecks and ruined  drunkards as well as healthy honest shearers. I'd sit down and talk to  the boozer or felon just as if I thought he was as good a man as me--and  he might be, for that matter--God knows.    \"The sick man would be kept till he recovered, or died; and the boozer,  suffering from a recovery, I'd keep him till he was on his legs again.\"    \"Then you'd have to have a doctor,\" I said.    \"Yes,\" said Mitchell, \"I'd fix that up all right. I wouldn't bother  much about a respectable medical practitioner from the city. I'd get a  medical wreck who had a brilliant career before him once in England and  got into disgrace, and cleared out to the colonies--a man who knows what  the d.t.'s is--a man who's been through it all and knows it all.\"    \"Then you'd want a manager, or a clerk or secretary,\" I suggested.    \"I suppose I would,\" said Mitchell. \"I've got no head for figures. I  suppose I'd have to advertise for him. If an applicant came with the  highest testimonials of character, and especially if one was signed by  a parson, I'd tell him to call again next week; and if a young man  could prove that he came of a good Christian family, and went to church  regularly, and sang in the choir, and taught Sunday-school, I'd tell him  that he needn't come again, that the vacancy was filled, for I  couldn't trust, him. The man who's been extra religious and honest and  hard-working in his young days is most likely to go wrong afterwards.  I'd sooner trust some poor old devil of a clerk who'd got into the hands  of a woman or racing men when he was young, and went wrong, and served  his time for embezzlement; anyway, I'd take him out and give him another  chance.\"    \"And what about woman's influence?\" I asked.    \"Oh, I suppose there'd have to be a woman, if only to keep the doctor on  the line. I'd get a woman with a past, one that hadn't been any better  than she should have been, they're generally the most kind-hearted  in the end. Say an actress who'd come down in the world, or an old  opera-singer who'd lost her voice but could still sing a little. A woman  who knows what trouble is. And I'd get a girl to keep her company, a  sort of housemaid, with a couple of black gins or half-castes to help  her. I'd get hold of some poor girl who'd been deceived and deserted:  and a baby or two wouldn't be an objection--the kids would amuse the  chaps and help humanize the place.\"    \"And what if the manageress fell in love with the doctor?\" I asked.    \"Well, I couldn't provide against love,\" said Mitchell. \"I fell in love  myself more than once--and I don't suppose I'd have been any worse off  if I'd have stayed in love. Ah, well! But suppose she did fall in love  with the doctor and marry him, or suppose she fell in love with him and  didn't marry him, for that matter--and suppose the girl fell in love  with the secretary? There wouldn't be any harm done; it would only make  them more contented with the home and bind them to it. They'd be a happy  family, and the Lost Souls' Hotel would be more cheerful and homelike  than ever.\"    \"But supposing they all fell in love with each other and cleared out,\" I  said.    \"I don't see what they'd have to clear out for,\" said Mitchell. \"But  suppose they did. There's more than one medical wreck in Australia, and  more than one woman with a past, and more than one broken old clerk who  went wrong and was found out, and who steadied down in jail, and there's  more than one poor girl that's been deceived. I could easily replace  'em. And the Lost Souls' Hotel might be the means of patching up many  wrecked lives in that way--giving people with pasts the chance of  another future, so to speak.\"    \"I suppose you'd have music and books and pictures?\" I said.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Mitchell. \"But I wouldn't have any bitter or sex-problem  books. They do no good. Problems have been the curse of the world ever  since it started. I think one noble, kindly, cheerful character in a  book does more good than all the clever villains or romantic adventurers  ever invented. And I think a man ought to get rid of his maudlin  sentiment in private, or when he's drunk. It's a pity that every writer  couldn't put all his bitterness into one book and then burn it.    \"No; I'd have good cheerful books of the best and brightest sides of  human nature--Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain, and Bret Harte, and those  men. And I'd have all Australian pictures--showing the brightest and  best side of Australian life. And I'd have all Australian songs.  I wouldn't have `Swannie Ribber,' or `Home, Sweet Home,' or  `Annie Laurie,' or any of those old songs sung at the Lost Souls'  Hotel--they're the cause of more heartbreaks and drink and suicide in  the bush than anything else. And if a jackaroo got up to sing, `Just  before the battle, mother,' or, `Mother bit me in me sleep,' he'd find  it was just before the battle all right. He'd have to go out and sleep  in the scrub, where the mosquitoes and bulldog ants would bite him  out of his sleep. I hate the man who's always whining about his mother  through his nose, because, as a rule, he never cared a rap for his old  mother, nor for anyone else, except his own paltry, selfish little self.    \"I'd have intellectual and elevating conversation for those that----\"    \"Who'd take charge of that department?\" I inquired hurriedly.    \"Well,\" reflected Mitchell, \"I did have an idea of taking it on myself  for a while anyway; but, come to think of it, the doctor or the woman  with the past would have more experience; and I could look after that  part of the business at a pinch. Of course you're not in a position to  judge as to my ability in the intellectual line; you see, I've had no  one to practise on since I've been with you. But no matter---- There'd  be intellectual conversation for the benefit of black-sheep new chums.  And any broken-down actors that came along could get up a play if they  liked--it would brighten up things and help elevate the bullock-drivers  and sundowners. I'd have a stage fixed up and a bit of scenery. I'd do  all I could to attract shearers to the place after shearing, and keep  them from rushing to the next shanty with their cheques, or down to  Sydney, to be cleaned out by barmaids.    \"And I'd have the hero squashed in the last act for a selfish sneak, and  marry the girl to the villain--he'd be more likely to make her happy in  the end.\"      \"And what about the farm?\" I asked. \"I suppose you'd get some expert  from the agricultural college to manage that?\"    \"No,\" said Mitchell. \"I'd get some poor drought-ruined selector and  put him in charge of the vegetation. Only, the worst of it is,\" he  reflected, \"if you take a selector who has bullocked all his life to  raise crops on dusty, stony patches in the scrubs, and put him on land  where there's plenty of water and manure, and where he's only got to  throw the seed on the ground and then light his pipe and watch it grow,  he's apt to get disheartened. But that's human nature.    \"And, of course, I'd have to have a `character' about the place--a sort  of identity and joker to brighten up things. I wouldn't get a man who'd  been happy and comfortable all his life; I'd get hold of some old codger  whose wife had nagged him till she died, and who'd been sold off many  times, and run in for drowning his sorrows, and who started as  an undertaker and failed at that, and finally got a job pottering  round--gardener, or gatekeeper, or something--in a lunatic asylum. I'd  get him. He'd most likely be a humorist and a philosopher, and he'd help  cheer up the Lost Souls' Hotel. I reckon the lost souls would get very  fond of him.\"    \"And would you have drink at Lost Souls'?\" I asked.    \"Yes,\" said Mitchell. \"I'd have the best beer and spirits and wine to  be had. After tea I'd let every man have just enough to make him feel  comfortable and happy, and as good and clever, and innocent and honest  as any other man, but no more. But if a poor devil came along in the  horrors, with every inch of him jumping, and snakes, and green-eyed  yahoos, and flaming-nosed bunyips chasing him, we'd take him in and give  him soothing draughts, and nurse him, and watch him, and clear him out  with purgatives, and keep giving him nips of good whisky, and, above  all, we'd sympathize with him, and tell him that we were worse than he  was many a time. We wouldn't tell him what a weak, selfish man he was,  or harp on his ruined life. We'd try to make him out a good deal better  morally than he really was. It's"]]]
