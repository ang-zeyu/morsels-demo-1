He did not,  however, remark the great change which had really taken place; her anxiety  for his recovery, her watching for hours at his bedside, appeared to him  rather proofs of friendship and love, than the effects of compassion, and  he hoped, on his recovery, to be re-instated in all his former rights.    But how greatly was he mistaken! In proportion as his health and strength  returned, all tenderness and affection for him vanished; nay, her aversion  for him now was equal to the pleasure with which she formerly regarded him.  He had also, in consequence of these multiplied reverses, contracted a  habit of ill-humour, of which he was himself not aware, and which greatly  contributed to alienate Antonelli. His own bad management in business he  attributed to others; so that, in his opinion, he was perfectly justified.  He looked upon himself as an unfortunate man, persecuted by the world, and  hoped for an equivalent to all his sufferings and misfortunes in the  undivided affection of his mistress.    This concession he insisted on, the first day he was able to leave his  chamber, and visit her. He demanded nothing less than that she should  resign herself up to him entirely, dismiss her other friends and  acquaintances, leave the stage, and live solely with him, and for him. She  showed him the impossibility of granting his demands, at first mildly, but  was at last obliged to confess the melancholy truth, that their former  relation existed no more. He left her, and never saw her again.    He lived some years longer, seeing but few acquaintances, and chiefly in  the company of a pious old lady, with whom he occupied the same dwelling,  and who lived on the rent of an adjoining house, her only income. During  this interval, he gained one of his law-suits, and soon after the other;  but his health was destroyed, and his future prospects blasted. A slight  cause brought on a relapse of his former illness; the physician acquainted  him with his approaching end. He was resigned to his fate, and his only  remaining wish was, once more to see his lovely friend. He sent the  servant to her, who, in more happy days, had often been the bearer of  tender messages. He prayed her to grant his request: she refused. He sent  a second time, entreating most ardently she might not be deaf to his  prayers, with no better success. She persisted in her first answer. The  night was already far advanced, when he sent a third time; she showed  great agitation, and confided to me the cause of her embarrassment, (for I  had just happened to be at supper, at her house, with the Marquess, and  some other friends.) I advised her--I entreated her, to show her friend  this last act of kindness. She seemed undecided, and in great emotion; but  after a few moments she became more collected. She sent away the servant  with a refusal, and he returned no more.    When supper was over, we sat together in familiar conversation, while  cheerfulness and good humour reigned among us. It was near midnight, when  suddenly a hollow, doleful sound was heard, like the groaning of a human  being; gradually it grew weaker, and at last died away entirely. A  momentary trembling seized us all; we stared at each other, and then  around us, unable to explain the mystery.    The Marquess ran to the window, while the rest of us were endeavouring to  restore the lady, who lay senseless on the floor. It was some time before  she recovered. The jealous Italian would scarcely give her time to open  her eyes, when he began to load her with reproaches. If you agree on signs  with your friends, said the Marquess, I pray you let them be less open and  terrifying. She replied, with her usual presence of mind, that, having the  right to see any person, at any time, in her house, she could hardly be  supposed to choose such appalling sounds as the forerunners of happy  moments.    And really there was something uncommonly terrifying in the sound; its  slowly lengthened vibrations were still fresh in our ears. Antonelli was  pale, confused, and every moment in danger of falling into a swoon. We  were obliged to remain with her half the night. Nothing more was heard. On  the following evening the same company was assembled; and although the  cheerfulness of the preceding day was wanting, we were not dejected.  Precisely at the same hour we heard the same hollow groan as the night  before.    We had in the meantime formed many conjectures on the origin of this  strange sound, which were as contradictory as they were extravagant. It is  unnecessary to relate every particular: in short, whenever Antonelli  supped at home, the alarming noise was heard at the same hour, sometimes  stronger, at others weaker. This occurrence was spoken of all over Naples.  Every inmate of the house, every friend and acquaintance, took the most  lively interest; even the police was summoned to attend. Spies were placed  at proper distances around the house. To such as stood in the street the  sound seemed to arise in the open air, while those in the room heard it  close by them. As often as she supped out all was silent, but whenever she  remained at home, she was sure to be visited by her uncivil guest; but  leaving her house was not always a means of escaping him. Her talent and  character gained her admittance into the first houses; the elegance of her  manners and her lively conversation, made her everywhere welcome; and, in  order to avoid her unpleasant visiter, she used to pass her evenings in  company out of the house.    A gentleman, whose age and rank made him respectable, accompanied her home  one evening in his coach. On taking leave of him at her door, the well  known voice issued from the steps beneath them; and the old gentleman, who  was perfectly well acquainted with the story, was helped into his coach  more dead than alive.    She was one evening accompanied by a young singer, in her coach, on a  visit to a friend's. He had heard of this mysterious affair, and being of  a lively disposition, expressed some doubts on the subject. I most  ardently wish, continued he, to hear the voice of your invisible companion;  do call him, there are two of us, we shall not be frightened. Without  reflecting, she had the courage to summon the spirit, and presently, from  the floor of the coach arose the appalling sound; it was repeated three  times, in rapid succession, and died away in a hollow moan. When the door  of the carriage was opened, both were found in a swoon, and it was some  time before they were restored and could inform those present of their  unhappy adventure.    This frequent repetition at length affected her health; and the spirit,  who seemed to have compassion on her, for some weeks gave no signs of his  presence. She even began to cherish a hope that she was now entirely rid  of him--but in this she was mistaken.    When the Carnival was over, she went into the country on a visit, in the  company of a lady, and attended only by one waiting maid. Night overtook  them before they could reach their journey's end; and suffering an  interruption, from the breaking of a chain, they were compelled to stop  for the night at an obscure inn by the road side. Fatigue made Antonelli  seek for repose immediately on their arrival; and she had just lain down,  when the waiting-maid, who was arranging a night-lamp, in a jesting tone,  observed, \"We are here, in a manner, at the end of the earth, and the  weather is horrible; will he be able to find us here?\" That moment the  voice was heard, louder and more terrible than ever. The lady imagined the  room filled with demons, and, leaping out of bed, ran down stairs,  alarming the whole house. Nobody slept a wink that night. This was the  last time the voice was heard. But this unwelcome visiter had soon another  and more disagreeable method of notifying his presence.    She had been left in peace some time, when one evening, at the usual hour,  while she was sitting at table with her friends, she was startled at the  discharge of a gun or a well-charged pistol; it seemed to have passed  through the window. All present heard the report and saw the flash, but on  examination the pane was found uninjured. The company was nevertheless  greatly concerned, and it was generally believed that some one's life had  been attempted. Some present ran to the police, while the rest searched  the adjoining houses;--but in vain; nothing was discovered that could  excite the least suspicion. The next evening sentinels were stationed at  all the neighbouring windows; the house itself, where Antonelli lived, was  closely searched, and spies were placed in the street.    But all this precaution availed nothing. Three months in succession, at  the same moment, the report was heard; the charge entered at the same pane  of glass without making the least alteration in its appearance; and what  is remarkable, it invariably took place precisely one hour before midnight;  although the Neapolitans have the Italian way of keeping time according to  which midnight forms no remarkable division. At length the shooting grew  as familiar as the voice had formerly been, and this innocent malice of  the spirit was forgiven him. The report often took place without  disturbing the company, or even interrupting their conversation.    One evening, after a very sultry day, Antonelli, without thinking of the  approaching hour, opened the window, and stepped with the Marquess on the  balcony. But a few moments had elapsed, when the invisible gun was  discharged, and both were thrown back into the room with a violent shock.  On recovering, the Marquess felt the pain of a smart blow on his right  check; and the singer, on her left. But no other injury being received,  this event gave"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10852"],[0,"Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs (#2)"],[1," neat specimen for the lawn or park. Light loam or a gravelly  subsoil suits it well.      AKEBIA.    AKEBIA QUINATA.--Chinese Akebia. China, 1845. This, with its  peculiarly-formed and curiously-coloured flowers, though usually  treated as a cool greenhouse plant, is yet sufficiently hardy to grow  and flower well in many of the southern and western English counties,  where it has stood uninjured for many years. It is a pretty twining  evergreen, with the leaves placed on long slender petioles, and  palmately divided into usually five leaflets. The sweet-scented  flowers, particularly so in the evening, are of a purplish-brown or  scarlet-purple, and produced in axillary racemes of from ten to a  dozen in each. For covering trellis-work, using as a wall plant, or to  clamber over some loose-growing specimen shrub, from which a slight  protection will also be afforded, the Akebia is peculiarly suitable,  and soon ascends to a height of 10 feet or 12 feet. Any ordinary  garden soil suits it, and propagation by cuttings is readily affected.      AMELANCHIER.    AMELANCHIER ALNIFOLIA.--Dwarf June Berry. N.W. America, 1888. This  is a shrub of great beauty, growing about 8 feet high, and a native of  the mountains from British America to California. This differs from A.  canadensis in having much larger and more brilliant-tinted fruit, and  in its shorter and more compact flower racemes. The shape of the  leaves cannot be depended on as a point of recognition, those before  me, collected in the native habitat of the plant, differing to a wide  extent in size and shape, some being coarsely serrated while others  are almost entire.    A. CANADENSIS.--June Berry. Canada, 1746. Unquestionably this is one  of the most beautiful and showy of early flowering trees. During the  month of April the profusion of snow-white flowers, with which even  young specimens are mantled, render the plant conspicuous for a long  way off, while in autumn the golden yellow of the dying-off foliage is  quite as remarkable. Being perfectly hardy, of free growth, and with  no particular desire for certain classes of soils, the June Berry  should be widely planted for ornamental effect. In this country it  attains to a height of 40 feet, and bears globose crimson fruit. There  are several varieties, including A. canadensis rotundifolia, A.  canadensis oblongifolia, and A. canadensis oligocarpa, the latter  being by some botanists ranked as a species.    A. VULGARIS.--Common Amelanchier. South of Europe, 1596. This is the  only European species, and grows about 16 feet in height. It has been  in cultivation in this country for nearly 300 years. Generally this  species flowers earlier than the American ones, has rounder and less  deeply serrated leaves, but the flowers are much alike. A. vulgaris  cretica, from Crete and Dalmatia, is readily distinguished by the soft  white hairs with which the under sides of the leaves are thickly  covered. To successfully cultivate the Amelanchiers a good rich soil  is a necessity, while shelter from cutting winds must be afforded if  the sheets of flowers are to be seen in their best form.      AMORPHA.    AMORPHA CANESCENS.--Lead Plant. Missouri, 1812. This is of much  smaller growth than A. fruticosa, with neat pinnate foliage, whitened  with hoary down, and bearing panicles of bluish-purple flowers, with  conspicuous orange anthers. It is a charming shrub, and all the more  valuable as it flowers at the end of summer, when few hardy plants are  in bloom. To grow it satisfactorily a dry, sandy soil is a necessity.    A. FRUTICOSA.--False Indigo. Carolina, 1724. This is a fast growing  shrub of fully 6 feet high, of loose, upright habit, and with pretty  pinnate leaves. The flowers are borne in densely packed spikes, and  are of a purplish tint with bright yellow protruding anthers and  produced at the end of summer. It prefers a dry, warm soil of a sandy  or chalky nature, and may readily be increased from cuttings or  suckers, the latter being freely produced. Hard cutting back when full  size has been attained would seem to throw fresh vigour into the  Amorpha, and the flowering is greatly enhanced by such a mode of  treatment. A native of Carolina, and perfectly hardy in most parts of  the country. Of this species there are several varieties, amongst  others, A. fruticosa nana, a dwarf, twiggy plant; A. fruticosa  dealbata, with lighter green foliage than the type; and others  differing only in the size and width of the leaves.      ANDROMEDA.    ANDROMEDA POLIFOLIA.--An indigenous shrub of low growth, with  lanceolate shining leaves, and pretty globose pinky-white flowers. Of  it there are two varieties. A. polifolia major and A. polifolia  angustifolia, both well worthy of culture for their neat habit and  pretty flowers.    See CASSANDRA, CASSIOPE, LEUCOTHOE, OXYDENDRUM, PIERIS, and ZENOBIA.      ARALIA.    ARALIA MANDSHURICA (_syn Dimorphanthus mandschuricus_).--Manchuria,  1866. There is not much beauty about this Chinese tree, for it is but  a big spiny stake, with no branches, and a tuft of palm-like foliage  at the top. The flowers, however, are both large and conspicuous, and  impart to the tree an interesting and novel appearance. They are  individually small, of a creamy-white colour, and produced in long,  umbellate racemes, and which when fully developed, from their weight  and terminal position, are tilted gracefully to one side. Usually the  stem is spiny, with Horse Chestnut-like bark, while the terminal bud,  from its large size, as if all the energy of the plant was  concentrated in the tip, imparts a curious and somewhat ungainly  appearance to the tree. From its curious tropical appearance this  species is well worthy of a place in the shrubbery. It is unmindful of  soil, if that is of at all fair quality, and may be said to be  perfectly hardy over the greater part of the country.    A. SPINOSA.--Angelica Tree. Virginia, 1688. Amongst autumn-flowering  shrubs this takes a high place, for in mild seasons it blooms well  into October. It grows about 12 feet high, with large tri-pinnate  leaves, composed of numerous serrulate leaflets. The individual  flowers are small and whitish, but being borne in large branched  panicles have a very imposing appearance. It is of free growth, and  produces suckers abundantly.    See also FATSIA.      ARBUTUS.    ARBUTUS ANDRACHNE.--Levant, 1724. This Mediterranean species is of  stout growth, with narrow Laurel-like leaves, reddish deciduous bark,  and greenish-white flowers that are produced freely in May. A hybrid  form, said to have originated between this species and A. Unedo,  partakes in part of the nature of both shrubs, but the flowers are  larger than those of A. Unedo.    A. MENZIESII (_syn A. procera_).--Tall Strawberry Tree. North-west  America, 1827. This is hardy in many parts of these islands,  particularly maritime districts, and is worthy of culture if only for  the large racemose panicles of deliciously-scented white flowers, and  peculiar metallic-green leaves. The fruit is orange-red, and only  about half the size of those of our commonly cultivated species.    A. UNEDO.--Strawberry Tree. Ireland. This is a beautiful evergreen  shrub or small-growing tree, sometimes fully 20 feet high, with  ovate-lanceolate leaves, and clusters of pure white or yellowish-tinged  flowers appearing in September and October. The bright scarlet fruit,  about the size of and resembling a Strawberry, is highly ornamental,  and when borne in quantity imparts to the plant an unusual and very  attractive appearance. Generally speaking, the Arbutus is hardy,  although in inland situations it is sometimes killed to the ground in  severe winters, but, springing freely from the root, the plant soon  becomes re-established. In a young state it suffers too, but after  becoming established and a few feet high, the chances of injury are  greatly minimised. Three well-marked varieties are A. Unedo coccinea  and A. Unedo rubra, bearing scarlet and deep-red flowers, and A. Unedo  microphylla, with much smaller leaves than those of the parent plant.    A. UNEDO CROOMEI differs considerably from the former, in having  larger foliage, larger clusters of reddish-pink flowers, and the bark  of the young shoots of an enticing ruddy, or rather brownish-red  colour. It is a very desirable and highly ornamental plant, and one  that is well worthy of extended culture.    There are several others, to wit A. photiniaefolia, A. Rollissoni, A.  Millerii, with large leaves, and pretty pink flowers, and A.  serratifolia, having deeply serrated leaves. Deep, light loam, if on  chalk all the better, and a fairly warm and sheltered situation, would  seem to suit the Arbutus best.      ARCTOSTAPHYLOS.    ARCTOSTAPHYLOS UVA-URSI.--Bearberry. Britain. A neat shrub of trailing  habit, and with flowers resembling those of the Arbutus, but much  smaller. The leaves are entire, dark green in colour, and about an  inch long, and obovate or oblong in shape. Fruit globular, of a bright  red, smooth and shining. This is a native shrub, being found in  Scotland, northern England and Ireland.    A. ALPINA.--Black Bearberry. Scotland. This is confined to the  northern Highlands of Scotland, is of smaller growth, with toothed  deciduous leaves, and small drooping flowers of two or three together.      ARISTOLOCHIA.    ARISTOLOCHIA SIPHO.--Dutchman's Pipe. North America, 1763. A  large-growing, deciduous climbing shrub, remarkable for its ample  foliage, and curiously formed yellow and purple streaked flowers. A  native of North America, it is perfectly hardy in this country, and  makes an excellent wall plant where plenty of space can be afforded  for the rambling branches. What a pity it is that so ornamental a  climber, whose big, dark-green leaves overlap each other as if  intended for keeping a house cool in warm weather, is not more  generally planted. It does well and grows fast in almost"]]]
