No money  was paid down, nor any deposit or security whatever given to the Company  by the supposed purchasers; so that if the stock had fallen, as might  have been expected, had the act not passed, they would have sustained no  loss. If, on the contrary, the price of stock advanced (as it actually  did by the success of the scheme), the difference by the advanced price  was to be made good to them. Accordingly, after the passing of the act,  the account of stock was made up and adjusted with Mr. Knight, and the  pretended purchasers were paid the difference out of the Company's cash.  This fictitious stock, which had been chiefly at the disposal of Sir  John Blunt, Mr. Gibbon, and Mr. Knight, was distributed among several  members of the government and their connexions, by way of bribe, to  facilitate the passing of the bill. To the Earl of Sunderland was  assigned 50,000 pounds of this stock; to the Duchess of Kendal 10,000  pounds; to the Countess of Platen 10,000 pounds; to her two nieces  10,000 pounds; to Mr. Secretary Craggs 30,000 pounds; to Mr. Charles  Stanhope (one of the Secretaries of the Treasury) 10,000 pounds; to the  Swordblade Company 50,000 pounds. It also appeared that Mr. Stanhope  had received the enormous sum of 250,000 pounds as the difference in the  price of some stock, through the hands of Turner, Caswall, and Co., but  that his name had been partly erased from their books, and altered to  Stangape. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had made profits  still more abominable. He had an account with the same firm, who were  also South Sea directors, to the amount of 794,451 pounds. He had,  besides, advised the Company to make their second subscription one  million and a half, instead of a million, by their own authority, and  without any warrant. The third subscription had been conducted in a  manner as disgraceful. Mr. Aislabie's name was down for 70,000 pounds;  Mr. Craggs, senior, for 659,000 pounds; the Earl of Sunderland's for  160,000 pounds; and Mr. Stanhope for 47,000 pounds. This report was  succeeded by six others, less important. At the end of the last, the  committee declared that the absence of Knight, who had been principally  intrusted, prevented them from carrying on their inquiries.    The first report was ordered to be printed, and taken into consideration  on the next day but one succeeding. After a very angry and animated  debate, a series of resolutions were agreed to, condemnatory of the  conduct of the directors, of the members of the Parliament and of the  administration concerned with them; and declaring that they ought, each  and all, to make satisfaction out of their own estates for the injury  they had done the public. Their practices were declared to be corrupt,  infamous, and dangerous; and a bill was ordered to be brought in for the  relief of the unhappy sufferers.    Mr. Charles Stanhope was the first person brought to account for his  share in these transactions. He urged in his defence that, for some  years past, he had lodged all the money he was possessed of in Mr.  Knight's hands, and whatever stock Mr. Knight had taken in for him, he  had paid a valuable consideration for it. As to the stock that had been  bought for him by Turner, Caswall, and Co. he knew nothing about it.  Whatever had been done in that matter was done without his authority,  and he could not be responsible for it. Turner and Co. took the latter  charge upon themselves, but it was notorious to every unbiased and  unprejudiced person that Mr. Stanhope was a gainer of the 250,000 pounds  which lay in the hands of that firm to his credit. He was, however,  acquitted by a majority of three only. The greatest exertions were made  to screen him. Lord Stanhope, the son of the Earl of Chesterfield, went  round to the wavering members, using all the eloquence he was possessed  of to induce them either to vote for the acquittal or to absent  themselves from the house. Many weak-headed country-gentlemen were led  astray by his persuasions, and the result was as already stated. The  acquittal caused the greatest discontent throughout the country. Mobs  of a menacing character assembled in different parts of London; fears  of riots were generally entertained, especially as the examination of  a still greater delinquent was expected by many to have a similar  termination. Mr. Aislabie, whose high office and deep responsibilities  should have kept him honest, even had native principle been  insufficient, was very justly regarded as perhaps the greatest criminal  of all. His case was entered into on the day succeeding the acquittal of  Mr. Starthope. Great excitement prevailed, and the lobbies and avenues  of the house were beset by crowds, impatient to know the result. The  debate lasted the whole day. Mr. Aislabie found few friends: his guilt  was so apparent and so heinous that nobody had courage to stand up in  his favour. It was finally resolved, without a dissentient voice, that  Mr. Aislabie had encouraged and promoted the destructive execution of  the South Sea scheme with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and had  combined with the directors in their pernicious practices to the ruin  of the public trade and credit of the kingdom: that he should for  his offences be ignominiously expelled from the House of Commons, and  committed a close prisoner to the Tower of London; that he should be  restrained from going out of the kingdom for a whole year, or till the  end of the next session of Parliament; and that he should make out a  correct account of all his estate, in order that it might be applied to  the relief of those who had suffered by his malpractices.    This verdict caused the greatest joy. Though it was delivered at  half-past twelve at night, it soon spread over the city. Several persons  illuminated their houses in token of their joy. On the following day,  when Mr. Aislabie was conveyed to the Tower, the mob assembled on  Tower-hill with the intention of hooting and pelting him. Not succeeding  in this, they kindled a large bonfire, and danced around it in the  exuberance of their delight. Several bonfires were made in other places;  London presented the appearance of a holiday, and people congratulated  one another as if they had just escaped from some great calamity. The  rage upon the acquittal of Mr. Stanhope had grown to such a height that  none could tell where it would have ended, had Mr. Aislabie met with the  like indulgence.    To increase the public satisfaction, Sir George Caswall, of the firm of  Turner, Caswall, & Co. was expelled the House on the following day, and  ordered to refund the sum of 250,000 pounds.    That part of the report of the Committee of Secrecy which related to the  Earl of Sunderland was next taken into consideration. Every effort was  made to clear his Lordship from the imputation. As the case against him  rested chiefly on the evidence extorted from Sir John Blunt, great  pains were taken to make it appear that Sir John's word was not to be  believed, especially in a matter affecting the honour of a peer and  privy councillor. All the friends of the ministry rallied around the  Earl, it being generally reported that a verdict of guilty against him  would bring a Tory ministry into power. He was eventually acquitted,  by a majority of 233 against 172; but the country was convinced of his  guilt. The greatest indignation was everywhere expressed, and menacing  mobs again assembled in London. Happily no disturbances took place.    This was the day on which Mr. Craggs, the elder, expired. The morrow had  been appointed for the consideration of his case. It was very generally  believed that he had poisoned himself. It appeared, however, that grief  for the loss of his son, one of the Secretaries of the Treasury, who had  died five weeks previously of the small-pox, preyed much on his mind.  For this son, dearly beloved, he had been amassing vast heaps of riches:  he had been getting money, but not honestly; and he for whose sake he  had bartered his honour and sullied his fame, was now no more. The  dread of further exposure increased his trouble of mind, and ultimately  brought on an apoplectic fit, in which he expired. He left a fortune of  a million and a half, which was afterwards confiscated for the  benefit of the sufferers by the unhappy delusion he had been so mainly  instrumental in raising.    One by one the case of every director of the Company was taken into  consideration. A sum amounting to two millions and fourteen thousand  pounds was confiscated from their estates towards repairing the mischief  they had done, each man being allowed a certain residue, in proportion  to his conduct and circumstances, with which he might begin the world  anew. Sir John Blunt was only allowed 5,000 pounds out of his fortune  of upwards of 183,000 pounds; Sir John Fellows was allowed 10,000  pounds out of 243,000 pounds; Sir Theodore Janssen, 50,000 pounds out of  243,000 pounds; Mr. Edward Gibbon, 10,000 pounds out of 106,000 pounds.;  Sir John Lambert, 5000 pounds out of 72,000 pounds. Others, less deeply  involved, were treated with greater liberality. Gibbon, the historian,  whose grandfather was the Mr. Edward Gibbon so severely mulcted, has  given, in the Memoirs of his Life and Writings, an interesting account  of the proceedings in Parliament at this time. He owns that he is not an  unprejudiced witness; but, as all the writers from which it is possible  to extract any notice of the proceedings of these disastrous years,  were prejudiced on the other side, the statements of the great historian  become of additional value. If only on the principle of audi alteram  partem, his opinion is entitled to consideration. \"In the year 1716,\" he  says, \"my grandfather was elected one of the directors of the South Sea  Company, and his books exhibited the proof that before his acceptance  of that fatal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#19)"],[1,"saw me  there awaiting him.    \"Did you hear it, Knox?\" he said.    \"A sound like the closing of a door?\"    Paul Harley nodded.    \"It _was_ the closing of a door,\" he replied; \"but before that I had  distinctly heard a stair creak. Someone crossed the hall then, Knox.  Yet, as you perceive for yourself, it affords no hiding-place.\"    His glance met and challenged mine.    \"The Colonel's visitor has left him,\" he murmured. \"Unless something  quite unforeseen occurs, I shall throw up the case to-morrow.\"          CHAPTER XII    MORNING MISTS        The man known as Manoel awakened me in the morning. Although  characteristically Spanish, he belonged to a more sanguine type than  the butler and spoke much better English than Pedro. He placed upon the  table beside me a tray containing a small pot of China tea, an apple, a  peach, and three slices of toast.    \"How soon would you like your bath, sir?\" he enquired.    \"In about half an hour,\" I replied.    \"Breakfast is served at 9.30 if you wish, sir,\" continued Manoel, \"but  the ladies rarely come down. Would you prefer to breakfast in your  room?\"    \"What is Mr. Harley doing?\"    \"He tells me that he does not take breakfast, sir. Colonel Don Juan  Menendez will be unable to ride with you this morning, but a groom will  accompany you to the heath if you wish, which is the best place for a  gallop. Breakfast on the south veranda is very pleasant, sir, if you are  riding first.\"    \"Good,\" I replied, for indeed I felt strangely heavy; \"it shall be the  heath, then, and breakfast on the veranda.\"    Having drunk a cup of tea and dressed I went into Harley's room, to  find him propped up in bed reading the _Daily Telegraph_ and smoking a  cigarette.    \"I am off for a ride,\" I said. \"Won't you join me?\"    He fixed his pillows more comfortably, and slowly shook his head.    \"Not a bit of it, Knox,\" he replied, \"I find exercise to be fatal to  concentration.\"    \"I know you have weird theories on the subject, but this is a beautiful  morning.\"    \"I grant you the beautiful morning, Knox, but here you will find me when  you return.\"    I knew him too well to debate the point, and accordingly I left him to  his newspaper and cigarette, and made my way downstairs. A housemaid was  busy in the hall, and in the courtyard before the monastic porch a negro  groom awaited me with two fine mounts. He touched his hat and grinned  expansively as I appeared. A spirited young chestnut was saddled for  my use, and the groom, who informed me that his name was Jim, rode a  smaller, Spanish horse, a beautiful but rather wicked-looking creature.    We proceeded down the drive. Pedro was standing at the door of the  lodge, talking to his surly-looking daughter. He saluted me very  ceremoniously as I passed.    Pursuing an easterly route for a quarter of a mile or so, we came to a  narrow lane which branched off to the left in a tremendous declivity.  Indeed it presented the appearance of the dry bed of a mountain torrent,  and in wet weather a torrent this lane became, so I was informed by  Jim. It was very rugged and dangerous, and here we dismounted, the groom  leading the horses.    Then we were upon a well-laid main road, and along this we trotted on to  a tempting stretch of heath-land. There was a heavy mist, but the  scent of the heather in the early morning was delightful, and there was  something exhilarating in the dull thud of the hoofs upon the springy  turf. The negro was a natural horseman, and he seemed to enjoy the ride  every bit as much as I did. For my own part I was sorry to return. But  the vapours of the night had been effectively cleared from my mind, and  when presently we headed again for the hills, I could think more coolly  of those problems which overnight had seemed well-nigh insoluble.    We returned by a less direct route, but only at one point was the path  so steep as that by which we had descended. This brought us out on a  road above and about a mile to the south of Cray's Folly. At one point,  through a gap in the trees, I found myself looking down at the gray  stone building in its setting of velvet lawns and gaily patterned  gardens. A faint mist hovered like smoke over the grass.    Five minutes later we passed a queer old Jacobean house, so deeply  hidden amidst trees that the early morning sun had not yet penetrated to  it, except for one upstanding gable which was bathed in golden light. I  should never have recognized the place from that aspect, but because of  its situation I knew that this must be the Guest House. It seemed very  gloomy and dark, and remembering how I was pledged to call upon Mr.  Colin Camber that day, I apprehended that my reception might be a cold  one.    Presently we left the road and cantered across the valley meadows, in  which I had walked on the previous day, reentering Cray's Folly on  the south, although we had left it on the north. We dismounted in the  stable-yard, and I noted two other saddle horses in the stalls, a pair  of very clean-looking hunters, as well as two perfectly matched ponies,  which, Jim informed me, Madame de Staemer sometimes drove in a chaise.    Feeling vastly improved by the exercise, I walked around to the veranda,  and through the drawing room to the hall. Manoel was standing there,  and:    \"Your bath is ready, sir,\" he said.    I nodded and went upstairs. It seemed to me that life at Cray's Folly  was quite agreeable, and such was my mood that the shadowy Bat Wing  menace found no place in it save as the chimera of a sick man's  imagination. One thing only troubled me: the identity of the woman who  had been with Colonel Menendez on the previous night.    However, such unconscious sun worshippers are we all that in the glory  of that summer morning I realized that life was good, and I resolutely  put behind me the dark suspicions of the night.    I looked into Harley's room ere descending, and, as he had assured  me would be the case, there he was, propped up in bed, the _Daily  Telegraph_ upon the floor beside him and the _Times_ now open upon the  coverlet.    \"I am ravenously hungry,\" I said, maliciously, \"and am going down to eat  a hearty breakfast.\"    \"Good,\" he returned, treating me to one of his quizzical smiles. \"It is  delightful to know that someone is happy.\"    Manoel had removed my unopened newspapers from the bedroom, placing  them on the breakfast table on the south veranda; and I had propped the  _Mail_ up before me and had commenced to explore a juicy grapefruit  when something, perhaps a faint breath of perfume, a slight rustle of  draperies, or merely that indefinable aura which belongs to the presence  of a woman, drew my glance upward and to the left. And there was Val  Beverley smiling down at me.    \"Good morning, Mr. Knox,\" she said. \"Oh, please don't interrupt your  breakfast. May I sit down and talk to you?\"    \"I should be most annoyed if you refused.\"    She was dressed in a simple summery frock which left her round,  sun-browned arms bare above the elbow, and she laid a huge bunch of  roses upon the table beside my tray.    \"I am the florist of the establishment,\" she explained. \"These  will delight your eyes at luncheon. Don't you think we are a lot of  barbarians here, Mr. Knox?\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well, if I had not taken pity upon you, here you would have bat over a  lonely breakfast just as though you were staying at a hotel.\"    \"Delightful,\" I replied, \"now that you are here.\"    \"Ah,\" said she, and smiled roguishly, \"that afterthought just saved  you.\"    \"But honestly,\" I continued, \"the hospitality of Colonel Menendez is  true hospitality. To expect one's guests to perform their parlour tricks  around a breakfast table in the morning is, on the other hand, true  barbarism.\"    \"I quite agree with you,\" she said, quietly. \"There is a perfectly  delightful freedom about the Colonel's way of living. Only some horrid  old Victorian prude could possibly take exception to it. Did you enjoy  your ride?\"    \"Immensely,\" I replied, watching her delightedly as she arranged the  roses in carefully blended groups.    Her fingers were very delicate and tactile, and such is the character  which resides in the human hand, that whereas the gestures of Madame de  Staemer were curiously stimulating, there was something in the movement  of Val Beverley's pretty fingers amidst the blooms which I found most  soothing.    \"I passed the Guest House on my return,\" I continued. \"Do you know Mr.  Camber?\"    She looked at me in a startled way.    \"No,\" she replied, \"I don't. Do you?\"    \"I met him by chance yesterday.\"    \"Really? I thought he was quite unapproachable; a sort of ogre.\"    \"On the contrary, he is a man of great charm.\"    \"Oh,\" said Val Beverley, \"well, since you have said so, I might as  well admit that he has always seemed a charming man to me. I have never  spoken to him, but he looks as though he could be very fascinating. Have  you met his wife?\"    \"No. Is she also American?\"    My companion shook her head.    \"I have no idea,\" she replied. \"I have seen her several times of course,  and she is one of the daintiest creatures imaginable, but I know nothing  about her nationality.\"    \"She is young, then?\"    \"Very young, I should say. She looks quite a child.\"    \"The reason of my interest,\" I replied, \"is that Mr. Camber asked me to  call upon him, and I propose to do so later this morning.\"    \"Really?\"    Again I detected the startled expression upon Val Beverley's face.    \"That is rather curious, since you are staying here.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well,\" she looked about her nervously, \"I don't know the reason, but  the name of Mr. Camber is anathema in Cray's Folly.\"    \"Colonel Menendez told me last night that he had never met Mr. Camber.\"    Val Beverley shrugged her shoulders, a habit which it was easy to see  she had acquired from Madame de Staemer.    \"Perhaps not,\" she replied, \"but I am certain he hates him.\"    \"Hates Mr. Camber?\"    \"Yes.\" Her"]]]
