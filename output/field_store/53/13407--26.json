The space, surrounded by the four, enclos'd  A car triumphal: on two wheels it came  Drawn at a Gryphon's neck; and he above  Stretch'd either wing uplifted, 'tween the midst  And the three listed hues, on each side three;  So that the wings did cleave or injure none;  And out of sight they rose.  The members, far  As he was bird, were golden; white the rest  With vermeil intervein'd.  So beautiful  A car in Rome ne'er grac'd Augustus pomp,  Or Africanus': e'en the sun's itself  Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun  Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell  At Tellus' pray'r devout, by the just doom  Mysterious of all-seeing Jove.  Three nymphs  at the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;  The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce  Been known within a furnace of clear flame:  The next did look, as if the flesh and bones  Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem'd the third.    Now seem'd the white to lead, the ruddy now;  And from her song who led, the others took  Their treasure, swift or slow.  At th' other wheel,  A band quaternion, each in purple clad,  Advanc'd with festal step, as of them one  The rest conducted, one, upon whose front  Three eyes were seen.  In rear of all this group,  Two old men I beheld, dissimilar  In raiment, but in port and gesture like,  Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one  Did show himself some favour'd counsellor  Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made  To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.  His fellow mark'd an opposite intent,  Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,  E'en as I view'd it with the flood between,  Appall'd me.  Next four others I beheld,  Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,  One single old man, sleeping, as he came,  With a shrewd visage.  And these seven, each  Like the first troop were habited, but wore  No braid of lilies on their temples wreath'd.  Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,  A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,  That they were all on fire above their brow.    Whenas the car was o'er against me, straight.  Was heard a thund'ring, at whose voice it seem'd  The chosen multitude were stay'd; for there,  With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.          CANTO XXX    Soon as the polar light, which never knows  Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil  Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament  Of the first heav'n, to duty each one there  Safely convoying, as that lower doth  The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix'd;  Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van  Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,  Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:  And one, as if commission'd from above,  In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:  \"Come, spouse, from Libanus!\" and all the rest  Took up the song--At the last audit so  The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each  Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,  As, on the sacred litter, at the voice  Authoritative of that elder, sprang  A hundred ministers and messengers  Of life eternal.  \"Blessed thou! who com'st!\"  And, \"O,\" they cried, \"from full hands scatter ye  Unwith'ring lilies;\" and, so saying, cast  Flowers over head and round them on all sides.    I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,  The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky  Oppos'd, one deep and beautiful serene,  And the sun's face so shaded, and with mists  Attemper'd at lids rising, that the eye  Long while endur'd the sight: thus in a cloud  Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,  And down, within and outside of the car,  Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath'd,  A virgin in my view appear'd, beneath  Green mantle, rob'd in hue of living flame:    And o'er my Spirit, that in former days  Within her presence had abode so long,  No shudd'ring terror crept.  Mine eyes no more  Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her  A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,  The power of ancient love was strong within me.    No sooner on my vision streaming, smote  The heav'nly influence, which years past, and e'en  In childhood, thrill'd me, than towards Virgil I  Turn'd me to leftward, panting, like a babe,  That flees for refuge to his mother's breast,  If aught have terrified or work'd him woe:  And would have cried: \"There is no dram of blood,  That doth not quiver in me.  The old flame  Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:\"  But Virgil had bereav'd us of himself,  Virgil, my best-lov'd father; Virgil, he  To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,  All, our prime mother lost, avail'd to save  My undew'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears.    \"Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,  Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge  Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.\"    As to the prow or stern, some admiral  Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,  When 'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;  Thus on the left side of the car I saw,  (Turning me at the sound of mine own name,  Which here I am compell'd to register)  The virgin station'd, who before appeared  Veil'd in that festive shower angelical.    Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;  Though from her brow the veil descending, bound  With foliage of Minerva, suffer'd not  That I beheld her clearly; then with act  Full royal, still insulting o'er her thrall,  Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back  The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:  \"Observe me well.  I am, in sooth, I am  Beatrice.  What! and hast thou deign'd at last  Approach the mountainnewest not, O man!  Thy happiness is whole?\"  Down fell mine eyes  On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,  Recoil'd, and sought the greensward: such a weight  Of shame was on my forehead.  With a mien  Of that stern majesty, which doth surround  mother's presence to her awe-struck child,  She look'd; a flavour of such bitterness  Was mingled in her pity.  There her words  Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:  \"In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:\"  But went no farther than, \"Thou Lord, hast set  My feet in ample room.\"  As snow, that lies  Amidst the living rafters on the back  Of Italy congeal'd when drifted high  And closely pil'd by rough Sclavonian blasts,  Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,  And straightway melting it distils away,  Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,  Without a sigh or tear, or ever these  Did sing, that with the chiming of heav'n's sphere,  Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain  Of dulcet symphony, express'd for me  Their soft compassion, more than could the words  \"Virgin, why so consum'st him?\"  then the ice,  Congeal'd about my bosom, turn'd itself  To spirit and water, and with anguish forth  Gush'd through the lips and eyelids from the heart.    Upon the chariot's right edge still she stood,  Immovable, and thus address'd her words  To those bright semblances with pity touch'd:  \"Ye in th' eternal day your vigils keep,  So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,  Conveys from you a single step in all  The goings on of life: thence with more heed  I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,  Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now  May equal the transgression.  Not alone  Through operation of the mighty orbs,  That mark each seed to some predestin'd aim,  As with aspect or fortunate or ill  The constellations meet, but through benign  Largess of heav'nly graces, which rain down  From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man  Was in the freshness of his being, such,  So gifted virtually, that in him  All better habits wond'rously had thriv'd.  The more of kindly strength is in the soil,  So much doth evil seed and lack of culture  Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness.  These looks sometime upheld him; for I show'd  My youthful eyes, and led him by their light  In upright walking.  Soon as I had reach'd  The threshold of my second age, and chang'd  My mortal for immortal, then he left me,  And gave himself to others.  When from flesh  To spirit I had risen, and increase  Of beauty and of virtue circled me,  I was less dear to him, and valued less.  His steps were turn'd into deceitful ways,  Following false images of good, that make  No promise perfect.  Nor avail'd me aught  To sue for inspirations, with the which,  I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,  Did call him back; of them so little reck'd him,  Such depth he fell, that all device was short  Of his preserving, save that he should view  The children of perdition.  To this end  I visited the purlieus of the dead:  And one, who hath conducted him thus high,  Receiv'd my supplications urg'd with weeping.  It were a breaking of God's high decree,  If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted  Without the cost of some repentant tear.\"          CANTO XXXI    \"O Thou!\"  her words she thus without delay  Resuming, turn'd their point on me, to whom  They but with lateral edge seem'd harsh before,  \"Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream,  If this be true.  A charge so grievous needs  Thine own avowal.\"  On my faculty  Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir'd  Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.    A little space refraining, then she spake:  \"What dost thou muse on?  Answer me.  The wave  On thy remembrances of evil yet  Hath done no injury.\"  A mingled sense  Of fear and of confusion, from my lips  Did such a \"Yea\" produce, as needed help  Of vision to interpret.  As when breaks  In act to be discharg'd, a cross-bow bent  Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd,  The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;  Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst  Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice  Was slacken'd on its way.  She straight began:  \"When my desire invited thee to love  The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,  What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain  Did meet thee, that thou so should'st quit the hope  Of further progress, or what bait of ease  Or promise of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#19)"],[1,"  From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone  Almost to level on our earth declines;  When from the midmost of this blue abyss  By turns some star is to our vision lost.  And straightway as the handmaid of the sun  Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light,  Fade, and the spangled firmament shuts in,  E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng.  Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight  The triumph, which plays ever round the point,  That overcame me, seeming (for it did)  Engirt by that it girdeth.  Wherefore love,  With loss of other object, forc'd me bend  Mine eyes on Beatrice once again.    If all, that hitherto is told of her,  Were in one praise concluded, 't were too weak  To furnish out this turn.  Mine eyes did look  On beauty, such, as I believe in sooth,  Not merely to exceed our human, but,  That save its Maker, none can to the full  Enjoy it.  At this point o'erpower'd I fail,  Unequal to my theme, as never bard  Of buskin or of sock hath fail'd before.  For, as the sun doth to the feeblest sight,  E'en so remembrance of that witching smile  Hath dispossess my spirit of itself.  Not from that day, when on this earth I first  Beheld her charms, up to that view of them,  Have I with song applausive ever ceas'd  To follow, but not follow them no more;  My course here bounded, as each artist's is,  When it doth touch the limit of his skill.    She (such as I bequeath her to the bruit  Of louder trump than mine, which hasteneth on,  Urging its arduous matter to the close),  Her words resum'd, in gesture and in voice  Resembling one accustom'd to command:  \"Forth from the last corporeal are we come  Into the heav'n, that is unbodied light,  Light intellectual replete with love,  Love of true happiness replete with joy,  Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight.  Here shalt thou look on either mighty host  Of Paradise; and one in that array,  Which in the final judgment thou shalt see.\"    As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen  Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes  The visive spirits dazzled and bedimm'd;  So, round about me, fulminating streams  Of living radiance play'd, and left me swath'd  And veil'd in dense impenetrable blaze.  Such weal is in the love, that stills this heav'n;  For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!    No sooner to my list'ning ear had come  The brief assurance, than I understood  New virtue into me infus'd, and sight  Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain  Excess of light, however pure.  I look'd;  And in the likeness of a river saw  Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves  Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on  'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,  Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,  There ever and anon, outstarting, flew  Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow'rs  Did set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;  Then, as if drunk with odors, plung'd again  Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one  Re'enter'd, still another rose.  \"The thirst  Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam'd,  To search the meaning of what here thou seest,  The more it warms thee, pleases me the more.  But first behooves thee of this water drink,  Or ere that longing be allay'd.\"  So spake  The day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin'd:  \"This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,  And diving back, a living topaz each,  With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,  Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth  They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things  Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,  For that thy views not yet aspire so high.\"  Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,  Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,  As I toward the water, bending me,  To make the better mirrors of mine eyes  In the refining wave; and, as the eaves  Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith  Seem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round,  Then as a troop of maskers, when they put  Their vizors off, look other than before,  The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;  So into greater jubilee were chang'd  Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw  Before me either court of heav'n displac'd.    O prime enlightener! thou who crav'st me strength  On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!  Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd,      There is in heav'n a light, whose goodly shine  Makes the Creator visible to all  Created, that in seeing him alone  Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,  That the circumference were too loose a zone  To girdle in the sun.  All is one beam,  Reflected from the summit of the first,  That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,  And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes  Its image mirror'd in the crystal flood,  As if 't admire its brave appareling  Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,  Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,  Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth  Has to the skies return'd.  How wide the leaves  Extended to their utmost of this rose,  Whose lowest step embosoms such a space  Of ample radiance!  Yet, nor amplitude  Nor height impeded, but my view with ease  Took in the full dimensions of that joy.  Near or remote, what there avails, where God  Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends  Her sway?  Into the yellow of the rose  Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,  Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent  Of praises to the never-wint'ring sun,  As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,  Beatrice led me; and, \"Behold,\" she said,  \"This fair assemblage! stoles of snowy white  How numberless!  The city, where we dwell,  Behold how vast! and these our seats so throng'd  Few now are wanting here!  In that proud stall,  On which, the crown, already o'er its state  Suspended, holds thine eyes--or ere thyself  Mayst at the wedding sup,--shall rest the soul  Of the great Harry, he who, by the world  Augustas hail'd, to Italy must come,  Before her day be ripe.  But ye are sick,  And in your tetchy wantonness as blind,  As is the bantling, that of hunger dies,  And drives away the nurse.  Nor may it be,  That he, who in the sacred forum sways,  Openly or in secret, shall with him  Accordant walk: Whom God will not endure  I' th' holy office long; but thrust him down  To Simon Magus, where Magna's priest  Will sink beneath him: such will be his meed.\"          CANTO XXXI    In fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay then  Before my view the saintly multitude,  Which in his own blood Christ espous'd.  Meanwhile  That other host, that soar aloft to gaze  And celebrate his glory, whom they love,  Hover'd around; and, like a troop of bees,  Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,  Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,  Flew downward to the mighty flow'r, or rose  From the redundant petals, streaming back  Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.  Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;  The rest was whiter than the driven snow.  And as they flitted down into the flower,  From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,  Whisper'd the peace and ardour, which they won  From that soft winnowing.  Shadow none, the vast  Interposition of such numerous flight  Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view  Obstructed aught.  For, through the universe,  Wherever merited, celestial light  Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents.    All there, who reign in safety and in bliss,  Ages long past or new, on one sole mark  Their love and vision fix'd.  O trinal beam  Of individual star, that charmst them thus,  Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below!    If the grim brood, from Arctic shores that roam'd,  (Where helice, forever, as she wheels,  Sparkles a mother's fondness on her son)  Stood in mute wonder 'mid the works of Rome,  When to their view the Lateran arose  In greatness more than earthly; I, who then  From human to divine had past, from time  Unto eternity, and out of Florence  To justice and to truth, how might I choose  But marvel too?  'Twixt gladness and amaze,  In sooth no will had I to utter aught,  Or hear.  And, as a pilgrim, when he rests  Within the temple of his vow, looks round  In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell  Of all its goodly state: e'en so mine eyes  Cours'd up and down along the living light,  Now low, and now aloft, and now around,  Visiting every step.  Looks I beheld,  Where charity in soft persuasion sat,  Smiles from within and radiance from above,  And in each gesture grace and honour high.    So rov'd my ken, and its general form  All Paradise survey'd: when round I turn'd  With purpose of my lady to inquire  Once more of things, that held my thought suspense,  But answer found from other than I ween'd;  For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,  I saw instead a senior, at my side,   Rob'd, as the rest, in glory.  Joy benign  Glow'd in his eye, and o'er his cheek diffus'd,  With gestures such as spake a father's love.  And, \"Whither is she vanish'd?\"  straight I ask'd.    \"By Beatrice summon'd,\" he replied,  \"I come to aid thy wish.  Looking aloft  To the third circle from the highest, there  Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit  Hath plac'd her.\"  Answering not, mine eyes I rais'd,  And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow  A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.  Not from the centre of the sea so far  Unto the region of the highest thunder,  As was my ken from hers; and yet the form  Came through that medium down, unmix'd and pure,    \"O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!  Who, for my safety, hast not scorn'd, in hell  To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark'd!  For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power  And goodness, virtue owe and grace.  Of slave,  Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,  For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.  Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.  That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,  Is loosen'd from this body, it may find  Favour with thee.\"  So I my suit preferr'd:  And she, so distant, as appear'd, look'd down,  And smil'd; then tow'rds th'"]]]
