Storm left his home in  1851 and did not return until 1864, after Schleswig-Holstein had become  German. He died July 4, 1888.    Storm is the poet of the North Sea Plain: he discovered its peculiar  beauty. While the tragic note predominates, joy and humor nevertheless  abound, and at the beginning of his poems Storm himself significantly  placed his _Oktoberlied_, written in the political gloom and uncertainty  of the fall of 1848. While realizing fully its inherent tragic elements,  Storm loved and glorified life and thirstily drank in its beauty to the  very last. This is the keynote of Storm's lyrics.        102.--21.

MEYER    Conrad Ferdinand Meyer was born October 12, 1825, in Zürich, and is thus  a fellow-townsman of Keller. Like Keller Meyer is a master of the  _Novelle_, but in all other respects there is a most striking difference.  Keller was a sturdy commoner and always retained a certain affinity with  the soil; there is a wholesome vigor about him. Meyer is of patrician  descent; His father, who died early, was a statesman and historian; his  mother a highly gifted woman of fine culture. Thus the boy grew up in an  atmosphere of refinement. Having finished the Gymnasium, he took up the  study of law, but history and the humanities were of greater interest to  him. Even in the child two traits were observed that later characterized  the man and the poet: he had a most scrupulous regard for neatness and  cleanliness, and he lived and experienced more deeply in memory than in  the immediate present. Meyer found himself only late in life; for many  years also, being practically bilingual, he wavered between French and  German. The Franco-German War brought the final decision, and from now on  his works appeared in rapid succession. He died in his home in Kilchberg  above Zürich, November 28, 1898.    Meyer's lyric verse is almost entirely the product of his later years. It  has none of the youthful exuberance of Goethe's earlier lyrics; a note of  quiet calm, a mellow maturity pervades all; both joy and sorrow live only  in the memory. And still Meyer loved life's exuberant fullness, and a  more finely attuned ear hears through this calm the beat of a heart that  felt joy and sorrow deeply. Everywhere there is apparent a love of nature  interpreted with all the modern subtlety of feeling. Meyer was a Swiss  and his landscape, is that of Switzerland, one might even say that of  Zürich. Nature hardly ever speaks in herself, but only in her human  relationship; not the field alone, but the field and the sower (121), the  field and the reaper (118); not the lake alone, but the lake and the  solitary oarsman (124). The poet loves the work of human hands and  especially its highest form, that of art. Thus a Roman fountain (119), a  picture, a statue become the subject of his verse. Of all the arts he  loved sculpture most, and in its chaste self-restraint his poetry is like  marble. Give marble a voice and you have a poem of Conrad Ferdinand  Meyer. His poetry is also akin to marble in its perfection of form that  is faultless, because it is the living rhythmic embodiment of an idea, of  an experience. Witness but the melody and the rhythm of _der römische  Brunnen_ or of the _Säerspruch_. In English letters Walter Savage Landor  is a kindred spirit and his _Finis_, except for a note of haughty pride,  might well be the epitaph of the Swiss poet:      I strove with none, for none was worth my strife.    Nature I loved and, next to Nature, Art:    I warmed both hands before the fire of life;    It sinks, and I am ready to depart.      114.--9-14. A series of \"_Liederseelen_.\" Every one of these lines  contains the idea of one of Meyer's poems; compare 116.        11. GEN ... EMPOR, _up towards_.      115.--10. DUMPFEN RUDERS, a case of transferred epithet. The sound goes,  of course, with _Schlagen_.      116.--8. FRÄGT, usually _fragt_.        11. DU TUST DIR'S SELBST ZU LEID, _You do it_ (i.e., _stay away_) _to      your own grief_.        12. WAS FÜR EIN, _what kind of a_.      119. The theme of Meyer's lyrics often is a painting, a piece of  sculpture, etc. Here a typical Roman fountain has found lasting  embodiment.        2. DER MARMORSCHALE RUND, _the round hollow of the marble basin_.      120.--3. ZUM ERSTEN, _at first_.      121. The poem in its rhythm embodies the rhythm of the sower. Compare  Millet's painting _The Sower_.      122.--4. NICHT EINER, DER DARBE, _not one that may suffer want_.      123. The Dutch school of painting is famous for its realism and its truth  to life. The effect of this poem is due in no small mean to contrast:  \"_das kleine zarte Bild_\" of the first two lines described, 12 ff., and  the \"_Junker mit der Dirn, der vor Gesundheit fast die Wange birst_\"; the  quiet of death, the quiet grief of the master, and the boisterous  fullness of life.        NACH, _according to, from_.        3. ES POCHT, _Somebody knocks_. HEREIN, _come in_.        5. VOR, _because of_.        6. VON, _with_.        10. ZUR STUNDE, _at once_.        16. NACH DER NATUR, _from life_.      126. It is necessary to bear in mind that in Switzerland dusk first  settles in the valleys and then gradually creeps up to the villages  situated on a higher level.        8. KILCHBERG, the poet's home near Zürich.      128.--3. GEMAHL, _n._ in poetry instead of _Gemahlin_.        4. MORGENSCHAUER, _the cool morning breezes_, the chill that falls      just before sunrise.        12. SOMMERHÖHN, the higher meadows where the cattle can graze only in      the summer months.          LILIENCRON    Detlev von Liliencron, a countryman of Hebbel and Storm, was born in  Kiel, June 3, 1844. He loved a soldier's life and served his country in  two wars, 1866 and 1870-71, and thus saw life in its grim reality.  Because of wounds and debts, he tells us, he left the army. An inborn  love of adventure and action made him try his fortune in America, where  his mother's father had served under Washington. His aim was to enter the  military service of one of the Central or South American states.  Disappointed in his hopes, he returned to Germany and for a number of  years was a government official. This task, however, proved too irksome  for his restless spirit, and in spite of his continual financial  embarrassments, he resigned to live as he pleased. He died in Hamburg,  July 22, 1909.    In his younger days, Liliencron felt the throb and stir of life far too  keenly to find leisure for literature. Not till 1884 did his first volume  of verse appear, recollections of his soldier days. The volume contains  graphic descriptions of the most concise brevity, single words taking the  place of whole sentences (132).    He delineates war with all its horror, not however without a sad pathos  (133). He is also a master at depicting the more joyous side of a  soldier's life, the carefree maneuvres of a regiment with its colors and  music passing through a village (130). In his love of nature Liliencron  is akin to Storm, and even surpasses the older poet in the  impressionistic vividness of his descriptions.      130. The poem pictures a German village scene: soldiers with their music  approach from the distance, march through and disappear.        3. BRICHT'S, _breaks forth_ or _bursts forth_.        6 ff. The attention is first focused on the deeper notes. A gradual      rise in pitch is noticeable in the lines from instrument to      instrument named.        24. LATERNENGLAS, of the street lanterns.        29. WILHEL(MINE), KATHARINE (TRINE), CHRI(STINE)      131.--9. SIRRT, an onomatopoetic word coined by the poet to imitate the  sound of the scythe cutting through the grain.        10. ARBEITSFRIEDEN, _the quiet peace of daily labor_.        11. HEIMATWELT, _home world_. Compare _Alltagswelt_, _work-a-day      world_.      132.--4. _march and flood of victory_.        11 f. DURCH DIE LÜFTE BRAUST, etc., _with horrible whir of wings a      flight of vultures passes through the air_.      133. Famous battle in the Seven Years War, in which Frederick the Great  was defeated with enormous losses by the Austrians.        2. SOMMERHALM, lit. summerstalk, i.e., _growing grain_.        4. IST AUS, _is over_.        9. _he had to go_.        16. BEVERN, a small town in Brunswick.        22. HINEIN, into the book.      134.--4. WINZERVOLK, collective sing. Best rendered as plural of  _Winzer_.      136. A lullaby for the poet's son _Wulff_ (_Wolf_).        3. MONDESKAHN, i.e., crescent moon-shaped like a boat. Render the      line, _slowly the crescent moon floats like a boat_.      137.--5. _The content of life not stirred by a breeze_.      138.--6 ff. SONNENGRÜN ... WEISS ... STILL.

To put either men or women to death for a difference of creed had not  occurred to them. It may justly be affirmed that in the horrors of  Smithfield and the Campo Santo, the innate barbarism of the Aryan,  breaking through his thin varnish of civilization, was found, far  transcending the utmost barbarism of the Indian. [Footnote: The Aryans  of Europe are undoubtedly superior in humanity, courage and  independence, to those of Asia. It is possible that the finer qualities  which distinguish the western branch of this stock may have been derived  from admixture with an earlier population of Europe, identical in race  and character with the aborigines of America. See Appendix, Note F.]          CHAPTER X.    THE IROQUOIS LANGUAGE.      As the mental faculties of a people are reflected in their speech, we  should naturally expect that the language of a race manifesting such  unusual powers as the Iroquois nations have displayed would be of a  remarkable character. In this expectation we are not disappointed. The  languages of the Huron-Iroquois family belong to what has been termed  the polysynthetic class, and are distinguished, even in that class, by a  more than ordinary endowment of that variety of forms and fullness of  expression for which languages of that type are noted. The  best-qualified judges have been the most struck with this peculiar  excellence. \"The variety of compounds,\" wrote the accomplished  missionary, Brebeuf, concerning the Huron tongue, \"is very great; it is  the key to the secret of their language. They have as many genders as  ourselves, as many numbers as the Greeks.\" Recurring to the same  comparison, he remarks of the Huron verb that it has as many tenses and  numbers as the Greek, with certain discriminations which the latter did  not possess. [Footnote: _Relation_ of 1636, pp 99,100.] A great living  authority has added the weight of his name to these opinions of the  scholarly Jesuit. Professor Max Muller, who took the opportunity  afforded by the presence of a Mohawk undergraduate at Oxford to study  his language, writes of it in emphatic terms: \"To my mind the structure  of such a language as the Mohawk is quite sufficient evidence that those  who worked out such a work of art were powerful reasoners and accurate  classifiers.\" [Footnote: In a letter to the author, dated Feb. 14, 1882.  In a subsequent letter Prof. Muller writes, in regard to the study of  the aboriginal languages of this continent: \"It has long been a puzzle  to me why this most tempting and promising field of philological  research has been allowed to lie almost fallow in America,--as if these  languages could not tell us quite as much of the growth of the human  mind as Chinese, or Hebrew, or Sanscrit.\" I have Prof. Max Miller's  permission to publish these extracts, and gladly do so, in the hope that  they may serve to stimulate that growing interest which the efforts of  scholars like Trumbull, Shea, Cuoq, Brinton, and, more recently, Major  Powell and his able collaborators of the Ethnological Bureau, are at  length beginning to awaken among us, in the investigation of this  important and almost unexplored province of linguistic science.]    It is a fact somewhat surprising, as well as unfortunate, that no  complete grammar of any language of the Huron-Iroquois stock has ever  been published. Many learned and zealous missionaries, Catholic and  Protestant, have labored among the tribes of this stock for more than  two centuries. Portions of the Scriptures, as well as some other works,  have been translated into several of these languages. Some small books,  including biographies and hymn-books, have been composed and printed in  two of them; and the late devoted and indefatigable missionary among the  Senecas, the Rev. Asher Wright, conducted for several years a  periodical, the \"Mental Elevator\" (_Ne Jaguhnigoageswatha_), in their  language. Several grammars are known to have been composed, but none  have as yet been printed in a complete form. One reason of this  unwillingness to publish was, undoubtedly, the sense which the compilers  felt of the insufficiency of their work; Such is the extraordinary  complexity of the language, such the multiplicity of its forms and the  subtlety of its distinctions, that years of study are required to master  it; and indeed it may be said that the abler the investigator and the  more careful his study, the more likely he is to be dissatisfied with  his success. This dissatisfaction was frankly expressed and practically  exhibited by Mr. Wright himself, certainly one of the best endowed and  most industrious of these inquirers. After residing for several years  among the Senecas, forming an alphabet remarkable for its precise  discrimination of sounds, and even publishing several translations in  their language, he undertook to give some account of its grammatical  forms. A little work printed in 1842, with the modest title of \"_A  Spelling-book of the Seneca Language_,\" comprises the variations of  nouns, adjectives and pronouns, given with much minuteness. Those of the  verbs are promised, but the book closes abruptly without them, for the  reason--as the author afterwards explained to a correspondent--that he  had not as yet been able to obtain such a complete knowledge of them as  he desired. This difficulty is further exemplified by a work purporting  to be a \"_Grammar of the Huron Language, by a Missionary of the Village  of Huron Indians, near Quebec, found amongst the papers of the Mission,  and translated from the Latin, by the Rev. John Wilkie_.\" This  translation is published in the \"_Transactions of the Literary and  Historical Society of Quebec_,\" for 1831, and fills more than a hundred  octavo pages. It is a work evidently of great labor, and is devoted  chiefly to the variations of the verbs; yet its lack of completeness may  be judged from the single fact that the \"transitions,\" or in other  words, the combinations of the double pronouns, nominative and  objective, with the transitive verb, which form such an important  feature of the language, are hardly noticed; and, it may be added,  though the conjugations are mentioned, they are not explained. The work,  indeed, would rather perplex than aid an investigator, and gives no  proper idea of the character and richness of the language. The same may  be said of the grammatical notices comprised in the Latin \"Proemium\" to  Bruyas' Iroquois dictionary. These notices are apparently modeled to  some extent on this anonymous grammar of the Huron language,--unless,  indeed, the latter may have been copied from Bruyas; the rules which  they give being in several instances couched in the same words.    Some useful grammatical explanations are found in the anonymous Onondaga  dictionary of the seventeenth century, published by Dr. Shea in his  \"_Library of American Linguistics_.\" But by far the most valuable  contribution to our knowledge of the structure of this remarkable group  of languages is found in the works of a distinguished writer of our own  day, the Rev. J. A. Cuoq, of Montreal, eminent both as a missionary and  as a philologist. After twenty years of labor among the Iroquois and  Algonkin tribes in the Province of Quebec, M. Cuoq was led to appear as  an author by his desire to defend his charges against the injurious  effect of a judgment which had been pronounced by a noted authority. M.  Renan had put forth, among the many theories which distinguish his  celebrated work on the Semitic languages, one which seemed to M. Cuoq as  mischievous as it was unfounded. M. Renan held that no races were  capable of civilization except such as have now attained it; and that  these comprised only the Aryan, the Semitic, and the Chinese. This  opinion was enforced by a reference to the languages spoken by the  members of those races. \"To imagine a barbarous race speaking a Semitic  or an Indo-European language is,\" he declares, \"an impossible  supposition (_une fiction, conradictoire_), which no person can  entertain who is familiar with the laws of comparative philology, and  with the general theory of the human intellect.\" To one who remembers  that every nation of the Indo-European race traces its descent from a  barbarous ancestry, and especially that the Germans in the days of  Tacitus were in precisely the same social stage as that of the Iroquois  in the days of Champlain, this opinion of the brilliant French  philologist and historian will seem erratic and unaccountable. M. Cuoq  sought to refute it, not merely by argument, but by the logic of facts.  In two works, published successively in 1864 and 1866, he showed, by  many and various examples, that the Iroquois and Algonkin languages  possessed all the excellences which M. Renan admired in the  Indo-European languages, and surpassed in almost every respect the  Semitic and Chinese tongues. [Footnote: See _Jugement Errone de M.  Ernest Renan sur les Langues Sauvages:_ (2d edit.) Dawson Brothers,  Montreal: 1870; and _Etudes Philologiques sur quelques Langues Sauvages  de r Amerique. Par N. O., Ancien Missionaire_. Ibid: 1866. Also _Lexique  de la Langue Iroquoise, avec notes et appendices. Par J. A. Cuoq, Pretre  de St. Sulpice_. J. Chapleau & Fils, Montreal: 1882. These are all works  indispensable to the student of Indian languages.] The resemblances of  these Indian languages to the Greek struck him, as it had struck his  illustrious predecessor, the martyred Brebeuf, two hundred years before.  M. Cuoq is also the author of a valuable Iroquois lexicon, with notes  and appendices, in which he discusses some interesting points in the  philology of the language. This lexicon is important, also, for  comparison with that of the Jesuit missionary, Bruyas, as showing how  little the language has varied in the course of two centuries.
