Don't, Polly, how can you?\" she begged, turning  back to twitch Polly's arm, \"you've done enough, I should think.\"    \"What did she run off for?\" cried Jasper, scaling the platform steps.  Polly glanced quickly up into his beaming face.    \"Oh, Jasper, she has gone home--I couldn't help it,\" and her face fell.    He looked annoyed. \"Never mind, Polly,\" he said, his brow clearing,  \"father wanted to introduce her to some friends, that's all. Well, and  wasn't it a grand success, though!\" and he beamed at her.    \"Yes,\" said Polly, settling Amy's music with an unsteady hand.    \"And Charlotte really surprised us all,\" he went on gaily. \"Why, Polly,  who would think that we have--or you rather, for you have done it  all--the honor to bring out a nightingale! Here, let me do that for  you.\" He was fairly bubbling over with delight, and as he essayed to  take the music out of Polly's hand, he laughed again. \"Dear me, how  stupid I am,\" as a piece fluttered to the floor.    \"And didn't Amy do nicely?\" asked Polly beginning to feel a bit tired  now.    \"Yes, indeed,\" assented Jasper enthusiastically, as he recovered the  piece. \"Just splendidly! I didn't know she had so much music in her. Oh,  here comes a horde of congratulations, Polly.\" He threw her the  brightest of smiles as he moved to make way for a group of friends  hurrying up to shower Polly with compliments, and every one had  something delightful to add of Charlotte Chatterton's singing.    \"Jasper couldn't help but be happy over Charlotte's singing,\" said Polly  to herself, and looking after him, \"it's so beautiful,\" as they came up.    \"Where are you going, Polly?\" called Alexia at last, when it was all  over, and the janitor was closing the big outer door, as Polly ran ahead  of the girls and down the long steps of The Exeter.    [Illustration: POLLY TURNED AND WAVED HER MUSIC-ROLL AT THEM]    Polly turned and waved her music-roll at them for a reply.    \"Now somebody is going to carry her off,\" grumbled Alexia; \"hurry up,  girls, let's see who it is.\" So they ran as lightly as Polly herself,  after her, down the steps, only in time to see old Mr. King help her  into the carriage with Mrs. Fisher and Phronsie, and drive rapidly off.    \"Whatever in the world is the matter?\" cried Alexia, running up to  Jasper who was watching them speed away.    \"Why, Polly thinks Charlotte is sick,\" explained Jasper, \"because she  went home before the Recital was out.\"    \"Stuff and nonsense!\" exclaimed Alexia angrily. \"What is the matter with  Polly, Jasper? She grows worse and worse. Why can't she let Charlotte  Chatterton alone, pray tell. I, for one, should think mischief enough  had been done by that girl.\"    \"You should think mischief enough had been done by Charlotte?\" repeated  Jasper in astonishment. \"I must say, Alexia, that I fail to understand  you.\"    \"To hear people praise to the very skies that Chatterton girl,\" cried  Alexia in a passion--she was actually stamping her foot now--\"oh, oh!  why don't some of you say something?\" she cried, appealing suddenly to  the girls. \"You all feel as I do about Polly's pushing forward that  girl; and there you stand and make me do all the talking.\"    Jasper looked grave at once. \"There is no occasion for any one to exert  herself to talk over this,\" he said. \"It is Polly's affair, and hers  alone.\" He raised his hat to her, and to the rest of the group, and  walked off.          CHAPTER X.    PHRONSIE HAS A PLAN.      Phronsie was the first to reach Charlotte's door.    \"Charlotte?\" she called softly through the keyhole. There was no answer,  and after one or two ineffectual attempts, Phronsie turned fearfully  away.    \"I do believe something is in the room with Charlotte,\" she said, as  Polly came running up the stairs. Then she sat down on the top step and  clasped her hands. \"I heard it raging up and down.\"    \"Oh, no, Phronsie,\" said Polly reassuringly, \"there couldn't be anything  in there with Charlotte. I'll try,\" and she laid a quick hand on the  knob. \"Oh, Charlotte, do open the door; you are worrying us all so,\"  called Polly imploringly.    Charlotte flung wide the door. Two red spots burned on her cheeks, and  her pale blue eyes snapped. But when she saw Polly, she said, \"I'm sorry  I frightened you, but I'm best alone.\"    \"Isn't there really anything in here with you, Charlotte?\" asked  Phronsie, getting off from her stair, to peer past Polly. \"Oh, I'm sure  I heard it raging up and down.\"    \"That was I,\" said Charlotte; \"I was the wild beast, Phronsie.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" breathed Phronsie.    \"And oh!\" exclaimed Polly.    \"Charlotte,\" said Phronsie, coming in to slip her hand into Charlotte's,  \"it was just beautiful when you sang; I thought it was birds when you  went clear up into the air. I did really, Charlotte.\"    \"Oh, don't!\" begged Charlotte, looking over at Polly.    \"Come down to dinner, Charlotte,\" said Polly quickly. \"Really you must,  else I am afraid Grandpapa will be up here after you.\"    \"I don't want any dinner,\" said Charlotte, drawing back.    \"Indeed, but you must come down,\" said Polly firmly, holding out her  hand. \"Come, Charlotte.\"    \"Let me smooth your hair,\" begged Phronsie, standing on tiptoe; \"do bend  down just a very little, please. There, that's it,\" patting Charlotte's  head with both hands; \"now you look very nice; you really do--doesn't  she, Polly.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Polly cheerily, \"just as fine as can be. There, they  are coming after us,\" as quick footsteps sounded in the hall below.  \"Hurry, Charlotte, do. We're coming, boys,\" she called.    They had just finished dinner, when a note was handed Polly. It ran  thus:    \"Do, dear Polly, run over to-morrow morning early. I want to consult you  in regard to asking Miss Chatterton to sing at my next 'At Home.' I  should be charmed to have her favor us.    \"FELICIA A. CABOT.\"    \"The very thing!\" exclaimed Jasper, with only a thought for Polly's  pleasure, when Polly had cried, \"How nice of Mrs. Cabot!\" \"Don't you say  so, father?\" he added.    \"Assuredly,\" said old Mr. King with great satisfaction in Polly's  pleasure, and at her success in drawing Charlotte out. And then he  thought no more about it, and the bell ringing and Mr. Alstyne coming  in, he went off into the library for a quiet chat.    And after this, there were no more quiet days for Charlotte Chatterton.  Everybody who was musical, wanted to revel in her voice; and everybody  who wasn't, wanted the same thing because it was so talked about. So she  was asked to sing at musicales and receptions without end, until Alexia  exclaimed at last, \"They are all raving, stark-mad over her, and it's  all Polly's own fault, the whole of it.\"    Phronsie laid down the note she was writing to Mrs. Fargo, a fortnight  later, and said to herself, \"I would better do it now, I think,\" and  going out, she went deliberately to old Mr. King's room, and rapped at  the door.    \"Come in!\" called the old gentleman, \"come in! Oh, bless me, it's you,  Phronsie!\" in pleased surprise.    \"Yes, Grandpapa,\" said Phronsie, coming in and shutting the door  carefully, \"I came on purpose to see you all alone.\"    \"So you did, dear,\" said Mr. King, highly gratified, and pushing away  his writing table, he held out his hand. \"Now, then, Phronsie, you are  never going to be too big, you know, to sit on my knee, so hop up now.\"    \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" cried Phronsie in a rapture, \"I could never be too  big for that,\" so she perched up as of old on his knee, then she folded  her hands and looked gravely in his face.    \"Well, my dear, what is it?\" asked the old gentleman presently, \"you've  come to tell me something, I suppose.\"    \"Yes, Grandpapa, I have,\" said Phronsie decidedly, \"and it is most  important too, Grandpapa, and oh, I do wish it so much,\" and she clasped  her hands tighter and sighed.    \"Well, then, Phronsie, if you want it, I suppose it must be,\" said Mr.  King, quite as a matter of course. \"But first, child, tell me what it  is,\" and he stroked her yellow hair.    \"Grandpapa,\" asked Phronsie suddenly, \"how much money did Mrs. Chatterton  say I was to have?\"    \"Oh, bless me!\" exclaimed Mr. King, with a start. \"Why, what makes you  ask such a question? Oh, she left you everything she had, Phronsie; a  couple of millions or so it is; why?\"    \"Grandpapa,\" asked Phronsie, looking intently at him, \"isn't Charlotte  very, very poor?\"    \"Charlotte poor?\" repeated the old gentleman. \"Why, no, not exactly; her  father isn't rich, but Charlotte, I think, may do very well, especially  as I intend to keep her here for a while, and then I shall never let her  suffer, Phronsie; never, indeed.\"    \"Grandpapa,\" said Phronsie, \"wasn't Mrs. Chatterton aunt to Charlotte?\"    \"Yes; that is, to Charlotte's father,\" corrected Mr. King. \"But what of  that, child, pray? What have you got into your head, Phronsie?\"    \"If Mrs. Chatterton was aunt to Charlotte,\" persisted Phronsie  slowly, \"it seems as if Charlotte ought to have some of the money. It  really does, Grandpapa.\"    \"But Cousin Eunice didn't think so, else she'd have left it to  Charlotte,\" said Mr. King abruptly, \"and she did choose to leave it to  you. So there's an end of it, Phronsie. I didn't want you to have it,  but the thing was fixed, and I couldn't help myself. And neither can we  do anything now, but take matters as they are.\"    \"I do think,\" said Phronsie, without taking her eyes from his face,  \"that maybe Mrs. Chatterton is sorry now, and wishes that she had left  some money to Charlotte. Don't you suppose so, Grandpapa?\" and one hand  stole up to his neck.    \"Maybe,\" said the old gentleman, with a short laugh, \"and I shouldn't  wonder if Cousin Eunice was sorry over a few other things too,  Phronsie.\"    \"Wouldn't it make her very glad if I gave Charlotte"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#19)"],[1,"of which they swing in mid-air or jump from tree to  tree in sheer lightness of heart. There is also the sloth, which, as  its name implies, is painfully deliberate in its motions. Were I a  Scotchman I should say that \"I dinna think that in a' nature there is a  mair curiouser cratur.\" Sidney Smith's summary of this strange animal  is that it moves suspended, rests suspended, sleeps suspended, and  passes its whole life in suspense. This latter state may also aptly  describe the condition of the traveller in those regions; for man,  brave though he may be, does not relish a _vis-a-vis_ with the enormous  anaconda, also to be seen there at most inconvenient times. I was able  to procure the skins of two of these giant serpents.    The leader of the \"forest gang,\" a Paraguayan, wore round his neck a  cotton scapular bought from the priest before he started on the  expedition. This was supposed to save him from all dangers, seen and  unseen. Poor man, he was a good Roman Catholic, and often counted his  beads, but he was an inveterate liar and thief.    Taking into consideration the wild country, and the adventurous mission  which had brought us together, our men were not at all a bad class. One  of them, however, a black Brazilian, used to boast at times that _he  had killed his father while he slept._ In the quiet of the evening hour  he would relate the story with unnatural gusto.    We generally slept on the deck of the steamer, each under a thin  netting, while the millions of mosquitos buzzed outside--and inside  when they could steal a march. Mosquitos? Why _\"mosquitos a la Paris\"_  was one of the items on our menu one day. The course was not altogether  an imaginary one either. Having the good fortune to possess candles, I  used sometimes to read under my gauzy canopy. This would soon become so  black with insects of all descriptions as to shut out from my sight the  outside world.    After carefully surveying the Bolivian shore, we fixed upon a site for  the future port and town. [Footnote: The latitude of Port Quijarro is  17 deg. 47' 35\", and the longitude, west of Greenwich, 57 deg. 44' 38\". Height  above the sea, 558 feet.] Planting a hugh palm in the ground, with a  long bamboo nailed to the crown, we then solemnly unfurled the Bolivian  flag. This had been made expressly for the expedition by the hands of  Senora Quijarro, wife of the Bolivian minister residing in Buenos  Ayres. As the sun for the first time shone upon the brilliant colors of  the flag, nature's stillness was broken by a good old English hurrah,  while the hunter and several others discharged their arms in the air,  until the parrots and monkeys in the neighborhood must have wondered  (or is wondering only reserved for civilized man?) what new thing had  come to pass. There we, a small company of men in nature's solitudes,  each signed his name to the _Act of Foundation_ of a town, which in all  probability will mean a new era for Bolivia. We fully demonstrated the  fact that Puerto Quijarro will be an ideal port, through which the  whole commerce of south-eastern Bolivia can to advantage pass.    Next day the Secretary drew out four copies of this _Act_. One was for  His Excellency General Pando, President of the Bolivian Republic;  another for the Mayor of Holy Cross, the nearest Bolivian town, 350  miles distant; a third for Senor Quijarro; while the fourth was  enclosed in a stone bottle and buried at the foot of the flagstaff,  there to await the erection of the first building. Thus a commencement  has been made; the lake and shores are now explored. The work has been  thoroughly done, and the sweat of the brow was not stinted, for the  birds of the air hovered around the theodolite, even on the top of the  highest adjacent mountain. [Footnote: The opening of the country must,  from its geographical situation, be productive of political  consequences of the first magnitude to South America.--Report of the  Royal Geographical Society, January, 1902.]    At last, this work over and an exhaustive chart of the lake drawn up,  tools and tents collected, specimens of soil, stones, iron, etc.,  packed and labelled, we prepared for departure.    The weather had been exceptionally warm and we had all suffered much  from the sun's vertical rays, but towards the end of our stay the heat  was sweltering--killing! The sun was not confined to one spot in the  heavens, as in more temperate climes; here he filled all the sky, and  he scorched us pitilessly! Only at early morning, when the eastern sky  blushed with warm gold and rose tints, or at even, when the great  liquid ball of fire dropped behind the distant violet-colored hills,  could you locate him. Does the Indian worship this awful majesty out of  fear, as the Chinaman worships the devil?    Next morning dawned still and portentous. Not a zephyr breeze stirred  the leaves of the trees. The sweltering heat turned to a suffocating  one. As the morning dragged on we found it more and more difficult to  breathe; there seemed to be nothing to inflate our lungs. By afternoon  we stared helplessly at each other and gasped as we lay simmering on  the deck. Were we to be asphyxiated there after all? I had known as  many as two hundred a day to die in one South American city from this  cause. Surely mortal men never went through such awful, airless heat as  this and lived. We had been permitted to discover the lake, and if the  world heard of our death, would that flippant remark be used again, as  with previous explorers, \"To make omelettes eggs must be broken\"?    However, we were not to _melt_. Towards evening the barometer, which  had been falling all day, went lower and lower. All creation was still.  Not a sound broke the awful quiet; only in our ears there seemed to be  an unnatural singing which was painful, and we closed our eyes in  weariness, for the sun seemed to have blistered the very eyeballs. When  we mustered up sufficient energy to turn our aching eyes to the  heavens, we saw black storm-clouds piling themselves one above another,  and hope, which \"springs eternal in the human breast,\" saw in them our  hope, our salvation.    The fall of the barometer, and the howling of the monkeys on shore  also, warned us of the approaching tempest, so we prepared for  emergencies by securing the vessel fore and aft under the lee of a  rugged _sierra_ before the storm broke--and break it did in all its  might.    Suddenly the wind swept down upon us with irresistible fury, and we  breathed--we lived again. So terrific was the sweep that giant trees,  which had braved a century's storms, fell to the earth with a crash.  The hurricane was truly fearful. Soon the waters of the lake were  lashed into foam. Great drops of rain fell in blinding torrents, and  every fresh roll of thunder seemed to make the mountains tremble, while  the lightning cleft asunder giant trees at one mighty stroke.      [Illustration: VICTORIA REGIA, THE WORLD'S LARGEST FLOWER]      In the old legends of the Inca, read on the \"Quipus,\" we find that  Pachacamac and Viracocha, the highest gods, placed in the heavens  \"Nusta,\" a royal princess, armed with a pitcher of water, which she was  to pour over the earth whenever it was needed. When the rain was  accompanied by thunder, lightning, and wind, the Indians believed that  the maiden's royal brother was teasing her, and trying to wrest the  pitcher from her hand. Nusta must indeed have been fearfully teased  that night, for the lightning of her eyes shot athwart the heavens and  the sky was rent in flame.    Often in those latitudes no rain falls for long months, but when once  the clouds open the earth is deluged! Weeks pass, and the zephyr  breezes scarcely move the leaves of the trees, but in those days of  calm the wind stores up his forces for a mighty storm. On this dark,  fearful night he blew his fiercest blasts. The wild beast was  affrighted from his lair and rushed down with a moan, or the mountain  eagle screamed out a wail, indistinctly heard through the moaning  sounds. During the whole night, which was black as wickedness, the wind  howled in mournful cadence, or went sobbing along the sand. As the  hours wore on we seemed to hear, in every shriek of the blast, the  strange tongue of some long-departed Indian brave, wailing for his  happy hunting-grounds, now invaded by the paleface. Coats and rugs,  that had not for many months been unpacked, were brought out, only in  some cases to be blown from us, for the wind seemed to try his hardest  to impede our departure. The rain soaked us through and through. Mists  rose from the earth, and mists came down from above. Next morning the  whole face of nature was changed.    After the violence of the tempest abated we cast off the ropes and  turned the prow of our little vessel civilizationward. When we entered  the lake the great golden sun gave us a warm welcome, now, at our  farewell, he refused to shine. The rainy season had commenced, but,  fortunately for us, after the work of exploration was done. This  weather continued--day after day clouds and rain. Down the rugged,  time-worn face of the mountains foaming streams rushed and poured, and  this was our last view--a good-bye of copious tears! Thus we saw the  lake in sunshine and storm, in light and darkness. It had been our aim  and ambition to reach it, and we rejoiced in its discovery. Remembering  that \"we were the first who ever burst into that silent sea,\" we seemed  to form part of it, and its varying moods only endeared it to us the  more. In mining parlance, we had staked out our claims there, for--      \"O'er no sweeter lake shall morning break,     Or noon cloud sail;    No fairer face than this shall take     The sunset's golden veil.\"          CHAPTER VII.    _PIEDRA BLANCA_.      In due time we again reached Piedra Blanca, and, notwithstanding our  ragged, thorn-torn garments, felt we were once more joined on to the  world.    The"]]]
