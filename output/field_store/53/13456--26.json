The more I look back the more I come to  think that I made the most of them, and if I had no more to regret in  married life than I have in my courting days, I wouldn't walk to and fro  in the room, or up and down the yard in the dark sometimes, or lie awake  some nights thinking.... Ah well!    I was between twenty-one and thirty then: birthdays had never been any  use to me, and I'd left off counting them. You don't take much stock in  birthdays in the Bush. I'd knocked about the country for a few years,  shearing and fencing and droving a little, and wasting my life without  getting anything for it. I drank now and then, and made a fool of  myself. I was reckoned 'wild'; but I only drank because I felt less  sensitive, and the world seemed a lot saner and better and kinder when  I had a few drinks: I loved my fellow-man then and felt nearer to him.  It's better to be thought 'wild' than to be considered eccentric  or ratty. Now, my old mate, Jack Barnes, drank--as far as I could  see--first because he'd inherited the gambling habit from his father  along with his father's luck: he'd the habit of being cheated and losing  very bad, and when he lost he drank. Till drink got a hold on him. Jack  was sentimental too, but in a different way. I was sentimental about  other people--more fool I!--whereas Jack was sentimental about himself.  Before he was married, and when he was recovering from a spree, he'd  write rhymes about 'Only a boy, drunk by the roadside', and that sort of  thing; and he'd call 'em poetry, and talk about signing them and sending  them to the 'Town and Country Journal'. But he generally tore them up  when he got better. The Bush is breeding a race of poets, and I don't  know what the country will come to in the end.    Well. It was after Jack and I had been out shearing at Beenaway shed in  the Big Scrubs. Jack was living in the little farming town of Solong,  and I was hanging round. Black, the squatter, wanted some fencing done  and a new stable built, or buggy and harness-house, at his place  at Haviland, a few miles out of Solong. Jack and I were good Bush  carpenters, so we took the job to keep us going till something else  turned up. 'Better than doing nothing,' said Jack.    'There's a nice little girl in service at Black's,' he said. 'She's more  like an adopted daughter, in fact, than a servant. She's a real good  little girl, and good-looking into the bargain. I hear that young Black  is sweet on her, but they say she won't have anything to do with him. I  know a lot of chaps that have tried for her, but they've never had any  luck. She's a regular little dumpling, and I like dumplings. They call  her 'Possum. You ought to try a bear up in that direction, Joe.'    I was always shy with women--except perhaps some that I should have  fought shy of; but Jack wasn't--he was afraid of no woman, good, bad, or  indifferent. I haven't time to explain why, but somehow, whenever a girl  took any notice of me I took it for granted that she was only playing  with me, and felt nasty about it. I made one or two mistakes, but--ah  well!    'My wife knows little 'Possum,' said Jack. 'I'll get her to ask her out  to our place and let you know.'    I reckoned that he wouldn't get me there then, and made a note to be on  the watch for tricks. I had a hopeless little love-story behind me, of  course. I suppose most married men can look back to their lost love; few  marry the first flame. Many a married man looks back and thinks it was  damned lucky that he didn't get the girl he couldn't have. Jack had been  my successful rival, only he didn't know it--I don't think his wife knew  it either. I used to think her the prettiest and sweetest little girl in  the district.    But Jack was mighty keen on fixing me up with the little girl at  Haviland. He seemed to take it for granted that I was going to fall in  love with her at first sight. He took too many things for granted as far  as I was concerned, and got me into awful tangles sometimes.    'You let me alone, and I'll fix you up, Joe,' he said, as we rode up  to the station. 'I'll make it all right with the girl. You're rather  a good-looking chap. You've got the sort of eyes that take with girls,  only you don't know it; you haven't got the go. If I had your eyes along  with my other attractions, I'd be in trouble on account of a woman about  once a-week.'    'For God's sake shut up, Jack,' I said.    Do you remember the first glimpse you got of your wife? Perhaps not in  England, where so many couples grow up together from childhood; but it's  different in Australia, where you may hail from two thousand miles away  from where your wife was born, and yet she may be a countrywoman of  yours, and a countrywoman in ideas and politics too. I remember the  first glimpse I got of Mary.    It was a two-storey brick house with wide balconies and verandahs all  round, and a double row of pines down to the front gate. Parallel at the  back was an old slab-and-shingle place, one room deep and about eight  rooms long, with a row of skillions at the back: the place was used for  kitchen, laundry, servants' rooms, &c. This was the old homestead before  the new house was built. There was a wide, old-fashioned, brick-floored  verandah in front, with an open end; there was ivy climbing up the  verandah post on one side and a baby-rose on the other, and a grape-vine  near the chimney. We rode up to the end of the verandah, and Jack called  to see if there was any one at home, and Mary came trotting out; so it  was in the frame of vines that I first saw her.    More than once since then I've had a fancy to wonder whether the  rose-bush killed the grape-vine or the ivy smothered 'em both in the  end. I used to have a vague idea of riding that way some day to see. You  do get strange fancies at odd times.    Jack asked her if the boss was in. He did all the talking. I saw a  little girl, rather plump, with a complexion like a New England or Blue  Mountain girl, or a girl from Tasmania or from Gippsland in Victoria.  Red and white girls were very scarce in the Solong district. She had the  biggest and brightest eyes I'd seen round there, dark hazel eyes, as I  found out afterwards, and bright as a 'possum's. No wonder they called  her ''Possum'. I forgot at once that Mrs Jack Barnes was the prettiest  girl in the district. I felt a sort of comfortable satisfaction in the  fact that I was on horseback: most Bushmen look better on horseback. It  was a black filly, a fresh young thing, and she seemed as shy of girls  as I was myself. I noticed Mary glanced in my direction once or twice  to see if she knew me; but, when she looked, the filly took all my  attention. Mary trotted in to tell old Black he was wanted, and after  Jack had seen him, and arranged to start work next day, we started back  to Solong.    I expected Jack to ask me what I thought of Mary--but he didn't. He  squinted at me sideways once or twice and didn't say anything for a long  time, and then he started talking of other things. I began to feel wild  at him. He seemed so damnably satisfied with the way things were going.  He seemed to reckon that I was a gone case now; but, as he didn't say  so, I had no way of getting at him. I felt sure he'd go home and  tell his wife that Joe Wilson was properly gone on little 'Possum at  Haviland. That was all Jack's way.    Next morning we started to work. We were to build the buggy-house at  the back near the end of the old house, but first we had to take down  a rotten old place that might have been the original hut in the Bush  before the old house was built. There was a window in it, opposite the  laundry window in the old place, and the first thing I did was to take  out the sash. I'd noticed Jack yarning with 'Possum before he started  work. While I was at work at the window he called me round to the other  end of the hut to help him lift a grindstone out of the way; and when  we'd done it, he took the tips of my ear between his fingers and thumb  and stretched it and whispered into it--    'Don't hurry with that window, Joe; the strips are hardwood and hard to  get off--you'll have to take the sash out very carefully so as not to  break the glass.' Then he stretched my ear a little more and put his  mouth closer--    'Make a looking-glass of that window, Joe,' he said.    I was used to Jack, and when I went back to the window I started to  puzzle out what he meant, and presently I saw it by chance.    That window reflected the laundry window: the room was dark inside and  there was a good clear reflection; and presently I saw Mary come to the  laundry window and stand with her hands behind her back, thoughtfully  watching me. The laundry window had an old-fashioned hinged sash, and I  like that sort of window--there's more romance about it, I think. There  was thick dark-green ivy all round the window, and Mary looked prettier  than a picture. I squared up my shoulders and put my heels together and  put as much style as I could into the work. I couldn't have turned round  to save my life.    Presently Jack came round, and Mary disappeared.    'Well?' he whispered.    'You're a fool, Jack,' I said. 'She's only interested in the old house  being pulled down.'    'That's all right,' he said. 'I've been keeping an eye on the business  round the corner, and she ain't interested when I'M round this end.'    'You seem mighty interested in the business,' I said.    'Yes,' said Jack. 'This sort of thing just suits a man of my rank in  times of peace.'    'What made you think of the window?' I asked.    'Oh, that's as simple as striking matches. I'm up to all those dodges.  Why, where there wasn't a window, I've fixed up a piece of looking-glass  to see if a girl was taking any notice of me when she thought I wasn't  looking.'    He went away, and presently Mary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#2)"],[1," and Mussalmans attain the height of courage and sacrifice that  is needed for this battle on behalf of Islam against the greed of the  West, a victory will be won not alone for Islam, but for Christianity  itself. Militarism has robbed the crucified God of his name and his very  cross and the World has been mistaking it to be Christianity. After the  battle of Islam is won, Islam and Hinduism together can emancipate  Christianity itself from the lust for power and wealth which have  strangled it now and the true Christianity of the Gospels will be  established. This battle of non-cooperation with its suffering and  peaceful withdrawal of service will once for all establish its  superiority over the power of brute force and unlimited slaughter.    What a glorious privilege it is to play our part in this history of the  world, when Hinduism and Christianity will unite on behalf of Islam, and  in that strife of mutual love and support each religion will attain its  own truest shape and beauty.      AN ENDURING TREATY    Swaraj for India has two great problems, one internal and the other  external. How can Hindus and Mussalmans so different from each other  form a strong and united nation governing themselves peacefully? This  was the question for years, and no one could believe that the two  communities could suffer for each other till the miracle was actually  worked. The Khilafat has solved the problem. By the magic of suffering,  each has truly touched and captured the other's heart, and the Nation  now is strong and united.    Not internal strength and unity alone has the Khilafat brought to India.  The great block in the way of Indian aspiration for full freedom was  the problem of external defence. How is India, left to herself defend  her frontiers against her Mussalman neighbours? None but emasculated  nations would accept such difficulties and responsibilities as an answer  to the demand for freedom. It is only a people whose mentality has been  perverted that can soothe itself with the domination by one race from a  distant country, as a preventative against the aggression of another, a  permanent and natural neighbour. Instead of developing strength to  protect ourselves against those near whom we are permanently placed, a  feeling of incurable impotence has been generated. Two strong and brave  nations can live side by side, strengthening each other through  enforcing constant vigilance, and maintain in full vigour each its own  national strength, unity, patriotism and resources. If a nation wishes  to be respected by its neighbours it has to develop and enter into  honourable treaties. These are the only natural conditions of national  liberty; but not a surrender to distant military powers to save oneself  from one's neighbours.    The Khilafat has solved the problem of distrust of Asiatic neighbours  out of our future. The Indian struggle for the freedom of Islam has  brought about a more lasting _entente_ and a more binding treaty between  the people of India and the people of the Mussalman states around it  than all the ententes and treaties among the Governments of Europe. No  wars of aggression are possible where the common people on the two sides  have become grateful friends. The faith of the Mussulman is a better  sanction than the seal of the European Diplomats and plenipotentiaries.  Not only has this great friendship between India and the Mussulman  States around it removed for all time the fear of Mussulman aggression  from outside, but it has erected round India, a solid wall of defence  against all aggression from beyond against all greed from Europe, Russia  or elsewhere. No secret diplomacy could establish a better _entente_ or  a stronger federation than what this open and non-governmental treaty  between Islam and India has established. The Indian support of the  Khilafat has, as if by a magic wand, converted what Was once the  Pan-Islamic terror for Europe into a solid wall of friendship and  defence for India.      THE BRITISH CONNECTION    Every nation like every individual is born free. Absolute freedom is the  birthright of every people. The only limitations are those which a  people may place over themselves. The British connection is invaluable  as long as it is a defence against any worse connection sought to be  imposed by violence. But it is only a means to an end, not a mandate of  Providence of Nature. The alliance of neighbours, born of suffering for  each other's sake, for ends that purify those that suffer, is  necessarily a more natural and more enduring bond than one that has  resulted from pure greed on the one side and weakness on the other.  Where such a natural and enduring alliance has been accomplished among  Asiatic peoples and not only between the respective governments, it may  truly be felt to be more valuable than the British connection itself,  after that connection has denied freedom or equality, and even justice.      THE ALTERNATIVE    Is violence or total surrender the only choice open to any people to  whom Freedom or Justice is denied? Violence at a time when the whole  world has learnt from bitter experience the futility of violence is  unworthy of a country whose ancient people's privilege, it was, to see  this truth long ago.    Violence may rid a nation of its foreign masters but will only enslave  it from inside. No nation can really be free which is at the mercy of  its army and its military heroes. If a people rely for freedom on its  soldiers, the soldiers will rule the country, not the people. Till the  recent awakening of the workers of Europe, this was the only freedom  which the powers of Europe really enjoyed. True freedom can exist only  when those who produce, not those who destroy or know only to live on  other's labour, are the masters.    Even were violence the true road to freedom, is violence possible to a  nation which has been emasculated and deprived of all weapons, and the  whole world is hopelessly in advance of all our possibilities in the  manufacture and the wielding of weapons of destruction.    Submission or withdrawal of co-operation is the real and only  alternative before India. Submission to injustice puts on the tempting  garb of peace and, gradual progress, but there is no surer way to death  than submission to wrong.      THE FIFTH UPAYA    Our ancients classified the arts of conquest into four well-known  _Upayas_. Sama, Dana, Uheda, and Danda. A fifth Upuya was recognised  sometimes by our ancients, which they called _Upeshka_. It is this  _Punchamopaya_ that is placed by Mahatma Gandhi before the people of  India in the form of Non-cooperation as an alternative, besides  violence, to surrender.    Where in any case negotiations have failed and the enemy is neither  corruptible nor incapable of being divided, and a resort to violence has  failed or would certainly be futile the method of _Upeshka_ remains to  be applied to the case. Indeed, when the very existence of the power we  seek to defeat really depends on our continuous co-operation with it,  and where our _Upeskha_ its very life, our _Upeskha_ or non-co-operation  is the most natural and most effective expedient that we can employ to  bend it to our will.    No Englishman believes that his nation can rule or keep India for a day  unless the people of India actively co-operate to maintain that rule.  Whether the co-operation be given willingly or through ignorance,  cupidity, habit or fear, the withdrawal of that co-operation means  impossibility of foreign rule in India. Some of us may not realise this,  but those who govern us have long ago known and are now keenly alive to  this truth. The active assistance of the people of this country in the  supply of the money, men, and knowledge of the languages, customs and  laws of the land, is the main-spring of the continuous life of the  foreign administration. Indeed the circumstances of British rule in this  country are such that but for a double supply of co-operation on the  part of the governed, it must have broken down long ago. Any system of  race domination is unnatural, and can be kept up only by active  coercion through a foreign-recruited public, service invested with large  powers, however much it may be helped by the perversion of mentality  shaping the education of the youth of the country. The foreign recruited  service must necessarily be very highly paid. This creates a wrong  standard for the Indian recruited officials also. Military expenditure  has to cover not only the needs of defence against foreign aggression,  but also the possibilities of internal unrest and rebellion. Police  charges have to go beyond the prevention and deletion of ordinary crime,  for though this would be the only expenditure over the police of a  self-governing people where any nation governs another, a large chapter of  artificial crime has to be added to the penal code, and the work of the  police extended accordingly. The military and public organisations must  also be such as not only to result in outside efficiency, but also at  the same time guarantee internal impotency. This is to be achieved by  the adjustment and careful admixture of officers and units from  different races. All this can be and is maintained only by extra cost  and extra-active co-operation on the part of the people. The slightest  withdrawal of assistance must put such machinery out of gear. This is  the basis of the programme of progressive non violent non-co-operation  that has been adopted by the National Congress.      SOME OBJECTIONS    The powerful character of the measure, however, leads some to object to  non-co-operation because of that very reason. Striking as it does at the  very root of Government in India, they fear that non-co-operation must  lead to anarchy, and that the remedy is worse than the disease. This is  an objection arising out of insufficient allowance for human nature. It  is assumed that the British"]]]
