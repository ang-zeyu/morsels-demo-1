Soon one of our consorts grounded, then another, every vessel  taking its turn, I believe, and then in turn getting off, until the  Norwich lay hopelessly stranded, for that tide at least, a few miles  below Jacksonville, and out of sight of the city, so that she could not  even add to our dignity by her visible presence from afar.    This was rather a serious matter, as the Norwich was our main naval  reliance, the Uncas being a small steamer of less than two hundred tons,  and in such poor condition that Commander Duncan, on finding himself  aground, at first quite declined to trust his consort any farther alone.  But, having got thus far, it was plainly my duty to risk the remainder  with or without naval assistance; and this being so, the courageous  officer did not long object, but allowed his dashing subordinate to  steam up with us to the city. This left us one naval and one army  gunboat; and, fortunately, the Burn-side, being a black propeller,  always passed for an armed vessel among the Rebels, and we rather  encouraged that pleasing illusion.    We had aimed to reach Jacksonville at daybreak; but these mishaps  delayed us, and we had several hours of fresh, early sunshine, lighting  up the green shores of that lovely river, wooded to the water's edge,  with sometimes an emerald meadow, opening a vista to some picturesque  house,--all utterly unlike anything we had yet seen in the South, and  suggesting rather the Penobscot or Kennebec. Here and there we glided  by the ruins of some saw-mill burned by the Rebels on General Wright's  approach; but nothing else spoke of war, except, perhaps, the silence.  It was a delicious day, and a scene of fascination. Our Florida men were  wild with delight; and when we rounded the point below the city, and saw  from afar its long streets, its brick warehouses, its white cottages,  and its overshadowing trees,--all peaceful and undisturbed by  flames,--it seemed, in the men's favorite phrase, \"too much good,\" and  all discipline was merged, for the moment, in a buzz of ecstasy.    The city was still there for us, at any rate; though none knew what  perils might be concealed behind those quiet buildings. Yet there were  children playing on the wharves; careless men, here and there, lounged  down to look at us, hands in pockets; a few women came to their doors,  and gazed listlessly upon us, shading their eyes with their hands. We  drew momently nearer, in silence and with breathless attention. The  gunners were at their posts, and the men in line. It was eight o'clock.  We were now directly opposite the town: yet no sign of danger was seen;  not a rifle-shot was heard; not a shell rose hissing in the air.  The Uncas rounded to, and dropped anchor in the stream; by previous  agreement, I steamed to an upper pier of the town, Colonel Montgomery  to a lower one; the little boat-howitzers were run out upon the wharves,  and presently to the angles of the chief streets; and the pretty town  was our own without a shot. In spite of our detention, the surprise had  been complete, and not a soul in Jacksonville had dreamed of our coming.    The day passed quickly, in eager preparations for defence; the people  could or would give us no definite information about the Rebel camp,  which was, however, known to be near, and our force did not permit our  going out to surprise it. The night following was the most anxious I  ever spent. We were all tired out; the companies were under arms, in  various parts of the town, to be ready for an attack at any moment. My  temporary quarters were beneath the loveliest grove of linden-trees,  and as I reclined, half-dozing, the mocking-birds sang all night like  nightingales,--their notes seeming to trickle down through the sweet air  from amid the blossoming boughs. Day brought relief and the sense of due  possession, and we could see what we had won.    Jacksonville was now a United States post again: the only post on the  main-land in the Department of the South. Before the war it had three or  four thousand inhabitants, and a rapidly growing lumber-trade, for which  abundant facilities were evidently provided. The wharves were capacious,  and the blocks of brick warehouses along the lower street were utterly  unlike anything we had yet seen in that region, as were the neatness and  thrift everywhere visible. It had been built up by Northern enterprise,  and much of the property was owned by loyal men. It had been a great  resort for invalids, though the Rebels had burned the large hotel  which once accommodated them. Mills had also been burned; but the  dwelling-houses were almost all in good condition. The quarters for the  men were admirable; and I took official possession of the handsome brick  house of Colonel Sunder-land, the established head-quarters through  every occupation, whose accommodating flag-staff had literally and  repeatedly changed its colors. The seceded Colonel, reputed author of  the State ordinance of Secession, was a New-Yorker by birth, and we  found his law-card, issued when in practice in Easton, Washington  County, New York. He certainly had good taste in planning the inside of  a house, though time had impaired its condition. There was a neat office  with ample bookcases and no books, a billiard-table with no balls,  gas-fixtures without gas, and a bathing-room without water. There was  a separate building for servants' quarters, and a kitchen with every  convenience, even to a few jars of lingering pickles. On the whole,  there was an air of substance and comfort about the town, quite alien  from the picturesque decadence of Beaufort.    The town rose gradually from the river, and was bounded on the rear by a  long, sluggish creek, beyond which lay a stretch of woods, affording an  excellent covert for the enemy, but without great facilities for attack,  as there were but two or three fords and bridges. This brook could  easily be held against a small force, but could at any time and at  almost any point be readily crossed by a large one. North of the town  the land rose a little, between the river and the sources of the brook,  and then sank to a plain, which had been partially cleared by a previous  garrison. For so small a force as ours, however, this clearing must be  extended nearer to the town; otherwise our lines would be too long for  our numbers.    This deficiency in numbers at once became a source of serious anxiety.  While planning the expedition, it had seemed so important to get the men  a foothold in Florida that I was willing to risk everything for it.  But this important post once in our possession, it began to show  some analogies to the proverbial elephant in the lottery. To hold it  permanently with nine hundred men was not, perhaps, impossible, with the  aid of a gunboat (I had left many of my own regiment sick and on duty  in Beaufort, and Colonel Montgomery had as yet less than one hundred and  fifty); but to hold it, and also to make forays up the river, certainly  required a larger number. We came in part to recruit, but had found  scarcely an able-bodied negro in the city; all had been removed farther  up, and we must certainly contrive to follow them. I was very unwilling  to have, as yet, any white troops under my command, with the blacks.  Finally, however, being informed by Judge S. of a conversation with  Colonel Hawley, commanding at Fernandina, in which the latter had  offered to send four companies and a light battery to swell our  force,--in view of the aid given to his position by this more advanced  post, I decided to authorize the energetic Judge to go back to  Fernandina and renew the negotiation, as the John Adams must go thither  at any rate for coal.    Meanwhile all definite display of our force was avoided; dress-parades  were omitted; the companies were so distributed as to tell for the  utmost; and judicious use was made, here and there, of empty tents. The  gunboats and transports moved impressively up and down the river,  from time to time. The disposition of pickets was varied each night to  perplex the enemy, and some advantage taken of his distrust, which might  be assumed as equalling our own. The citizens were duly impressed by our  supply of ammunition, which was really enormous, and all these things  soon took effect. A loyal woman, who came into town, said that the Rebel  scouts, stopping at her house, reported that there were \"sixteen hundred  negroes all over the woods, and the town full of them besides.\" \"It was  of no use to go in. General Finnegan had driven them into a bad place  once, and should not do it again.\" \"They had lost their captain and  their best surgeon in the first skirmish, and if the Savannah people  wanted the negroes driven away, they might come and do it themselves.\"  Unfortunately, we knew that they could easily come from Savannah at any  time, as there was railroad communication nearly all the way; and  every time we heard the steam-whistle, the men were convinced of their  arrival. Thus we never could approach to any certainty as to their  numbers, while they could observe, from the bluffs, every steamboat that  ascended the river.    To render our weak force still more available, we barricaded the  approaches to the chief streets by constructing barriers or felling  trees. It went to my heart to sacrifice, for this purpose, several of my  beautiful lindens; but it was no time for aesthetics. As the giants lay  on the ground, still scenting the air with their abundant bloom, I used  to rein up my horse and watch the children playing hide-and-seek amongst  their branches, or some quiet cow grazing at the foliage. Nothing  impresses the mind in war like some occasional object or association  that belongs apparently to peace alone.    Among all these solicitudes, it was a great thing that one particular  anxiety vanished in a day. On the former expedition the men were upon  trial as to their courage; now they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#19)"],[1,"    'Had not the deed been done which is done, I should have said this day to  myself, \"It is an honour to Alcinous, and to his children after him, that  the far-famed Argonauts are his guests.\"  But these Colchi are my guests,  as you are; and for this month they have waited here with all their  fleet, for they have hunted all the seas of Hellas, and could not find  you, and dared neither go farther, nor go home.'    'Let them choose out their champions, and we will fight them, man for  man.'    'No guests of ours shall fight upon our island, and if you go outside  they will outnumber you.  I will do justice between you, for I know and  do what is right.'    Then he turned to his kings, and said, 'This may stand over till  to-morrow.  To-night we will feast our guests, and hear the story of all  their wanderings, and how they came hither out of the ocean.'    So Alcinous bade the servants take the heroes in, and bathe them, and  give them clothes.  And they were glad when they saw the warm water, for  it was long since they had bathed.  And they washed off the sea-salt from  their limbs, and anointed themselves from head to foot with oil, and  combed out their golden hair.  Then they came back again into the hall,  while the merchant kings rose up to do them honour.  And each man said to  his neighbour, 'No wonder that these men won fame.  How they stand now  like Giants, or Titans, or Immortals come down from Olympus, though many  a winter has worn them, and many a fearful storm.  What must they have  been when they sailed from Iolcos, in the bloom of their youth, long  ago?'    Then they went out to the garden; and the merchant princes said, 'Heroes,  run races with us.  Let us see whose feet are nimblest.'    'We cannot race against you, for our limbs are stiff from sea; and we  have lost our two swift comrades, the sons of the north wind.  But do not  think us cowards: if you wish to try our strength, we will shoot, and  box, and wrestle, against any men on earth.'    And Alcinous smiled, and answered, 'I believe you, gallant guests; with  your long limbs and broad shoulders, we could never match you here.  For  we care nothing here for boxing, or for shooting with the bow; but for  feasts, and songs, and harping, and dancing, and running races, to  stretch our limbs on shore.'    So they danced there and ran races, the jolly merchant kings, till the  night fell, and all went in.    And then they ate and drank, and comforted their weary souls, till  Alcinous called a herald, and bade him go and fetch the harper.    The herald went out, and fetched the harper, and led him in by the hand;  and Alcinous cut him a piece of meat, from the fattest of the haunch, and  sent it to him, and said, 'Sing to us, noble harper, and rejoice the  heroes' hearts.'    So the harper played and sang, while the dancers danced strange figures;  and after that the tumblers showed their tricks, till the heroes laughed  again.    Then, 'Tell me, heroes,' asked Alcinous, 'you who have sailed the ocean  round, and seen the manners of all nations, have you seen such dancers as  ours here, or heard such music and such singing?  We hold ours to be the  best on earth.'    'Such dancing we have never seen,' said Orpheus; 'and your singer is a  happy man, for Phoebus himself must have taught him, or else he is the  son of a Muse, as I am also, and have sung once or twice, though not so  well as he.'    'Sing to us, then, noble stranger,' said Alcinous; 'and we will give you  precious gifts.'    So Orpheus took his magic harp, and sang to them a stirring song of their  voyage from Iolcos, and their dangers, and how they won the golden  fleece; and of Medeia's love, and how she helped them, and went with them  over land and sea; and of all their fearful dangers, from monsters, and  rocks, and storms, till the heart of Arete was softened, and all the  women wept.  And the merchant kings rose up, each man from off his golden  throne, and clapped their hands, and shouted, 'Hail to the noble  Argonauts, who sailed the unknown sea!'    Then he went on, and told their journey over the sluggish northern main,  and through the shoreless outer ocean, to the fairy island of the west;  and of the Sirens, and Scylla, and Charybdis, and all the wonders they  had seen, till midnight passed and the day dawned; but the kings never  thought of sleep.  Each man sat still and listened, with his chin upon  his hand.    And at last, when Orpheus had ended, they all went thoughtful out, and  the heroes lay down to sleep, beneath the sounding porch outside, where  Arete had strewn them rugs and carpets, in the sweet still summer night.    But Arete pleaded hard with her husband for Medeia, for her heart was  softened.  And she said, 'The Gods will punish her, not we.  After all,  she is our guest and my suppliant, and prayers are the daughters of Zeus.  And who, too, dare part man and wife, after all they have endured  together?'    And Alcinous smiled.  'The minstrel's song has charmed you: but I must  remember what is right, for songs cannot alter justice; and I must be  faithful to my name.  Alcinous I am called, the man of sturdy sense; and  Alcinous I will be.'  But for all that Arete besought him, until she won  him round.    So next morning he sent a herald, and called the kings into the square,  and said, 'This is a puzzling matter: remember but one thing.  These  Minuai live close by us, and we may meet them often on the seas; but  Aietes lives afar off, and we have only heard his name.  Which, then, of  the two is it safer to offend--the men near us, or the men far off?'    The princes laughed, and praised his wisdom; and Alcinous called the  heroes to the square, and the Colchi also; and they came and stood  opposite each other, but Medeia stayed in the palace.  Then Alcinous  spoke, 'Heroes of the Colchi, what is your errand about this lady?'    'To carry her home with us, that she may die a shameful death; but if we  return without her, we must die the death she should have died.'    'What say you to this, Jason the AEolid?' said Alcinous, turning to the  Minuai.    'I say,' said the cunning Jason, 'that they are come here on a bootless  errand.  Do you think that you can make her follow you, heroes of the  Colchi--her, who knows all spells and charms?  She will cast away your  ships on quicksands, or call down on you Brimo the wild huntress; or the  chains will fall from off her wrists, and she will escape in her  dragon-car; or if not thus, some other way, for she has a thousand plans  and wiles.  And why return home at all, brave heroes, and face the long  seas again, and the Bosphorus, and the stormy Euxine, and double all your  toil?  There is many a fair land round these coasts, which waits for  gallant men like you.  Better to settle there, and build a city, and let  Aietes and Colchis help themselves.'    Then a murmur rose among the Colchi, and some cried 'He has spoken well;'  and some, 'We have had enough of roving, we will sail the seas no more!'  And the chief said at last, 'Be it so, then; a plague she has been to us,  and a plague to the house of her father, and a plague she will be to you.  Take her, since you are no wiser; and we will sail away toward the  north.'    Then Alcinous gave them food, and water, and garments, and rich presents  of all sorts; and he gave the same to the Minuai, and sent them all away  in peace.    So Jason kept the dark witch-maiden to breed him woe and shame; and the  Colchi went northward into the Adriatic, and settled, and built towns  along the shore.    Then the heroes rowed away to the eastward, to reach Hellas, their  beloved land; but a storm came down upon them, and swept them far away  toward the south.  And they rowed till they were spent with struggling,  through the darkness and the blinding rain; but where they were they  could not tell, and they gave up all hope of life.  And at last touched  the ground, and when daylight came waded to the shore; and saw nothing  round but sand and desolate salt pools, for they had come to the  quicksands of the Syrtis, and the dreary treeless flats which lie between  Numidia and Cyrene, on the burning shore of Africa.  And there they  wandered starving for many a weary day, ere they could launch their ship  again, and gain the open sea.  And there Canthus was killed, while he was  trying to drive off sheep, by a stone which a herdsman threw.    And there too Mopsus died, the seer who knew the voices of all birds; but  he could not foretell his own end, for he was bitten in the foot by a  snake, one of those which sprang from the Gorgon's head when Perseus  carried it across the sands.    At last they rowed away toward the northward, for many a weary day, till  their water was spent, and their food eaten; and they were worn out with  hunger and thirst.  But at last they saw a long steep island, and a blue  peak high among the clouds; and they knew it for the peak of Ida, and the  famous land of Crete.  And they said, 'We will land in Crete, and see  Minos the just king, and all his glory and his wealth; at least he will  treat us hospitably, and let us fill our water-casks upon the shore.'    But when they came nearer to the island they saw a wondrous sight upon  the cliffs.  For on a cape to the westward stood a giant, taller than any  mountain pine, who glittered aloft against the sky like a tower of  burnished brass.  He turned and looked on all sides round him, till he  saw the _Argo_ and her crew; and when he saw them he came toward them,  more swiftly than the swiftest horse, leaping across the glens at a  bound, and striding at one step from down to down.  And when he came  abreast of them he brandished his arms up and down, as a ship hoists and  lowers her yards, and shouted with his brazen throat like a trumpet from  off the hills, 'You are pirates, you are robbers!  If you dare land here,  you die.'    Then the heroes cried, 'We are no pirates."]]]
