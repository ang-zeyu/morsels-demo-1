Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,    And dreamt she heard them bleating;  But when she awoke, she found it a joke,    For still they all were fleeting.    Then up she took her little crook,    Determined for to find them;  She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,    For they'd left all their tails behind 'em!    It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray    Unto a meadow hard by--  There she espied their tails, side by side,    All hung on a tree to dry.    She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye,    And over the hillocks she raced;  And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,    That each tail should be properly placed.

Little Robin chirped and sang, and what did Pussy say?  Pussy-Cat said: \"Mew, mew, mew,\" and Robin flew away.      A MELANCHOLY SONG    Trip upon trenchers,  And dance upon dishes,  My mother sent me for some barm, some barm;  She bid me go lightly,  And come again quickly,  For fear the young men should do me some harm.  Yet didn't you see, yet didn't you see,  What naughty tricks they put upon me?  They broke my pitcher  And spilt the water,  And huffed my mother,  And chid her daughter,  And kissed my sister instead of me.

Nothing can be more clearly shewn, than that an inexhaustible mine of  wealth is neglected in _Africa_, for prosecution of this impious  traffick; that, if proper measures were taken, the revenue of this  country might be greatly improved, its naval strength increased, its  colonies in a more flourishing situation, the planters richer, and a  trade, which is now a scene of blood and desolation, converted into one,  which might be prosecuted with _advantage_ and _honour_.    Such have been the exertions of the Quakers in the cause of humanity  and virtue. They are still prosecuting, as far as they are able, their  benevolent design; and I should stop here and praise them for thus  continuing their humane endeavours, but that I conceive it to be  unnecessary. They are acting consistently with the principles of  religion. They will find a reward in their own consciences; and they  will receive more real pleasure from a single reflection on their  conduct, than they can possibly experience from the praises of an host  of writers.    In giving this short account of those humane and worthy persons, who  have endeavoured to restore to their fellow creatures the rights of  nature, of which they had been unjustly deprived, I would feel myself  unjust, were I to omit two zealous opposers of the _colonial_ tyranny,  conspicuous at the present day.    The first is Mr. _Granville Sharp_. This Gentleman has particularly  distinguished himself in the cause of freedom. It is a notorious fact,  that, but a few years since, many of the unfortunate black people, who  had been brought from the colonies into this country, were sold in the  metropolis to merchants and others, when their masters had no farther  occasion for their services; though it was always understood that every  person was free, as soon as he landed on the British shore. In  consequence of this notion, these unfortunate black people, refused to  go to the new masters, to whom they were consigned. They were however  seized, and forcibly conveyed, under cover of the night, to ships then  lying in the _Thames_, to be retransported to the colonies, and to be  delivered again to the planters as merchantable goods. The humane Mr.  _Sharpe_, was the means of putting a stop to this iniquitous traffick.  Whenever he gained information of people in such a situation, he caused  them to be brought on shore. At a considerable expence he undertook  their cause, and was instrumental in obtaining the famous decree in the  case of _Somersett_, that as soon as any person whatever set his foot in  this country, he came under the protection of the _British_ laws, and was  consequently free. Nor did he interfere less honourably in that cruel  and disgraceful case, in the summer of the year 1781, when _an hundred  and thirty two_ negroes, in their passage to the colonies, were thrown  into the sea alive, to defraud the underwriters; but his pious  endeavours were by no means attended with the same success. To enumerate  his many laudable endeavours in the extirpation of tyranny and  oppression, would be to swell the preface into a volume: suffice it to  say, that he has written several books on the subject, and one  particularly, which he distinguishes by the title of \"_A Limitation of  Slavery_.\"    The second is the _Rev. James Ramsay_. This gentleman resided for  many years in the _West-Indies_, in the clerical office. He perused  all the colonial codes of law, with a view to find if there were any  favourable clauses, by which the grievances of slaves could be  redressed; but he was severely disappointed in his pursuits. He  published a treatise, since his return to England, called _An Essay on  the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar  Colonies_, which I recommend to the perusal of the humane reader.  This work reflects great praise upon the author, since, in order to be  of service to this singularly oppressed part of the human species, he  compiled it at the expence of forfeiting that friendship, which he had  contracted with many in those parts, during a series of years, and at  the hazard, as I am credibly informed, of suffering much, in his private  property, as well as of subjecting himself to the ill will and  persecution of numerous individuals.    This Essay _on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves_,  contains so many important truths on the colonial slavery, and has come  so home to the planters, (being written by a person who has a thorough  knowledge of the subject) as to have occasioned a considerable alarm.  Within the last eight months, two publications have expressly appeared  against it. One of them is intitled \"_Cursory Remarks_ on Mr.  Ramsay's Essay;\" the other an \"_Apology for Negroe Slavery_.\" On  each of these I am bound, as writing on the subject, to make a few  remarks.    The _cursory remarker_ insinuates, that Mr. Ramsay's account of the  treatment is greatly exaggerated, if not wholly false. To this I shall  make the following reply. I have the honour of knowing several  disinterested gentlemen, who have been acquainted with the West Indian  islands for years. I call them disinterested, because they have neither  had a concern in the _African_ trade, nor in the _colonial_  slavery: and I have heard these unanimously assert, that Mr.  _Ramsay's_ account is so far from being exaggerated, or taken from  the most dreary pictures that he could find, that it is absolutely below  the truth; that he must have omitted many instances of cruelty, which he  had seen himself; and that they only wondered, how he could have written  with so much moderation upon the subject. They allow the _Cursory  Remarks_ to be excellent as a composition, but declare that it is  perfectly devoid of truth.    But the _cursory remarker_ does not depend so much on the  circumstances which he has advanced, (nor can he, since they have no  other existence than in his own, brain) as on the instrument  _detraction_. This he has used with the utmost virulence through  the whole of his publication, artfully supposing, that if he could bring  Mr. _Ramsay's_ reputation into dispute, his work would fall of  course, as of no authenticity. I submit this simple question to the  reader. When a writer, in attempting to silence a publication, attacks  the character of its author, rather than the principles of the work  itself, is it not a proof that the work itself is unquestionable, and  that this writer is at a loss to find an argument against it?    But there is something so very ungenerous in this mode of replication,  as to require farther notice. For if this is the mode to be adopted in  literary disputes, what writer can be safe? Or who is there, that will  not be deterred from taking up his pen in the cause of virtue? There are  circumstances in every person's life, which, if given to the publick in  a malevolent manner, and without explanation, might essentially injure  him in the eyes of the world; though, were they explained, they would be  even reputable. The _cursory remarker_ has adopted this method of  dispute; but Mr. _Ramsay_ has explained himself to the satisfaction  of all parties, and has refuted him in every point. The name of this  _cursory remarker_ is _Tobin_: a name, which I feel myself  obliged to hand down with detestation, as far as I am able; and with an  hint to future writers, that they will do themselves more credit, and  serve more effectually the cause which they undertake, if on such  occasions they attack the work, rather than the character of the writer,  who affords them a subject for their lucubrations.    Nor is this the only circumstance, which induces me to take such  particular notice of the _Cursory Remarks_. I feel it incumbent  upon me to rescue an injured person from the cruel aspersions that have  been thrown upon him, as I have been repeatedly informed by those, who  have the pleasure of his acquaintance, that his character is  irreproachable. I am also interested myself. For if such detraction is  passed over in silence, my own reputation, and not my work, may be  attacked by an anonymous hireling in the cause of slavery.    The _Apology for Negroe Slavery_ is almost too despicable a  composition to merit a reply. I have only therefore to observe, (as is  frequently the case in a bad cause, or where writers do not confine  themselves to truth) that the work refutes itself. This writer, speaking  of the slave-trade, asserts, that people are never kidnapped on the  coast of _Africa_. In speaking of the treatment of slaves, he  asserts again, that it is of the very mildest nature, and that they live  in the most comfortable and happy manner imaginable. To prove each of  his assertions, he proposes the following regulations. That the  _stealing_ of slaves from _Africa_ should be felony. That the  _premeditated murder_ of a slave by any person on board, should  come under the same denomination. That when slaves arrive in the  colonies, lands should be allotted for their provisions, _in  proportion to their number_, or commissioners should see that a  _sufficient_ quantity of _sound wholesome_ provisions is  purchased. That they should not work on _Sundays_ and _other_  holy-days. That extra labour, or _night-work, out of crop_, should  be prohibited. That a _limited number_ of stripes should be  inflicted upon them. That they should have _annually_ a suit of  clothes. That old infirm slaves should be _properly cared for_,  &c.--Now it can hardly be conceived, that if this author had tried to  injure his cause, or contradict himself, he "]]]
