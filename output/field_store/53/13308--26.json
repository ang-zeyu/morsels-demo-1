We should not have marvelled in the least that a     genius like Stevenson should rebel against mere external 'happy     endings,' which, being in flat contradiction to the ordinary ways of     Providence, are little short of thoughtless blasphemy against     Providence.  But the terrible thing about the Stevenson philosophy of     life is that it seems to make evil overcome good in the sense of     absorbing it, or perverting it, or at best lowering it.  When good and     evil come in conflict in one person, Dr Jekyll vanishes into Mr Hyde.     The awful Master of Ballantrae drags down his brother, though he seems     to fight for his soul at every step.  The sequel to _Kidnapped_ shows     David Balfour ready at last to be hail-fellow-well-met with the supple     Prestongrange and the other intriguers, even though they had forcibly     made him a partner to their shedding of innocent blood.       \"Is it possible that this was what Stevenson's experience of real life     had brought him?  Fortunate himself in so many respects, he was yet     one of those who turn aside from the smooth and sunny paths of life,     to enter into brotherly sympathy and fellowship with the disinherited.     Is this, then, what he found on those darker levels?  Did he discover     that triumphant hypocrisy treads down souls as well as lives?       \"We cannot doubt that it often does so; and it is well that we should     see this sometimes, to make us strong to contend with evil before it     works out this, its worst mischief, and to rouse us from the easy     optimist laziness which sits idle while others are being wronged, and     bids them believe 'that all will come right in the end,' when it is     our direct duty to do our utmost to make it 'come right' to-day.       \"But to show us nothing but the gloomy side, nothing but the weakness     of good, nothing but the strength of evil, does not inspire us to     contend for the right, does not inform us of the powers and weapons     with which we might so contend.  To gaze at unqualified and inevitable     moral defeat will but leave us to the still worse laziness of     pessimism, uttering its discouraging and blasphemous cry, 'It does not     matter; nothing will ever come right!'       \"Shakespeare has shown us--and never so nobly as in his last great     creation of _The Tempest_--that a man has one stronghold which none     but himself can deliver over to the enemy--that citadel of his own     conduct and character, from which he can smile supreme upon the foe,     who may have conquered all down the line, but must finally make pause     there.       \"We must remember that _The Tempest_ was Shakespeare's last work.  The     genuine consciousness of the possible triumph of the moral nature     against every assault is probably reserved for the later years of     life, when, somewhat withdrawn from the passions of its struggle, we     become those lookers-on who see most of the game.  Strange fate is it     that so much of our genius vanishes into the great silence before     those later years are reached!\"    Stevenson was too late in awakening fully to the tragic error to which  short-sighted youth is apt to wander that \"bad-heartedness is strength.\"  And so, from this point of view, to our sorrow, he too much verified  Goethe's saw that \"simplicity (not artifice) and repose are the acme of  art, and therefore no youth can be a master.\"  In fact, he might very  well from another side, have taken one of Goethe's fine sayings as a  motto for himself:       \"Greatest saints were ever most kindly-hearted to sinners;     Here I'm a saint with the best; sinners I never could hate.\" {7}    Stevenson's own verdict on _Deacon Brodie_ given to a _New York Herald_  reporter on the author's arrival in New York in September 1887, on the  _Ludgate Hill_, is thus very near the precise truth: \"The piece has been  all overhauled, and though I have no idea whether it will please an  audience, I don't think either Mr Henley or I are ashamed of it.  _But we  were both young men when we did that_, _and I think we had an idea that  bad-heartedness was strength_.\"    If Mr Henley in any way confirmed R. L. Stevenson in this perversion, as  I much fear he did, no true admirer of Stevenson has much to thank him  for, whatever claims he may have fancied he had to Stevenson's eternal  gratitude.  He did Stevenson about the very worst turn he could have  done, and aided and abetted in robbing us and the world of yet greater  works than we have had from his hands.  He was but condemning himself  when he wrote some of the detractory things he did in the _Pall Mall  Magazine_ about the _Edinburgh Edition_, etc.  Men are mirrors in which  they see each other: Henley, after all, painted himself much more  effectively in that now notorious _Pall Mall Magazine_ article than he  did R. L. Stevenson.  Such is the penalty men too often pay for wreaking  paltry revenges--writing under morbid memories and narrow and petty  grievances--they not only fail in truth and impartiality, but inscribe a  kind of grotesque parody of themselves in their effort to make their  subject ridiculous, as he did, for example, about the name Lewis=Louis,  and various other things.    R. L. Stevenson's fate was to be a casuistic and mystic moralist at  bottom, and could not help it; while, owing to some kink or twist, due,  perhaps, mainly to his earlier sufferings, and the teachings he then  received, he could not help giving it always a turn to what he himself  called \"tail-foremost\" or inverted morality; and it was not till near the  close that he fully awakened to the fact that here he was false to the  truest canons at once of morality and life and art, and that if he  pursued this course his doom was, and would be, to make his endings  \"disgrace, or perhaps, degrade his beginnings,\" and that no true and  effective dramatic unity and effect and climax was to be gained.  Pity  that he did so much on this perverted view of life and world and art: and  well it is that he came to perceive it, even though almost too  late:--certainly too late for that full presentment of that awful yet  gladdening presence of a God's power and equity in this seeming tangled  web of a world, the idea which inspired Robert Browning as well as  Wordsworth, when he wrote, and gathered it up into a few lines in _Pippa  Passes_:       \"The year's at the spring,     And day's at the morn;     Morning's at seven;     The hillsides dew-pearled;       The lark's on the wing;     The snail's on the thorn:     God's in His heaven,     All's right with the world.       . . . . . . . . . . . .       \"All service ranks the same with God,     If now, as formerly he trod     Paradise, His presence fills     Our earth, each only as God wills     Can work--God's puppets best and worst,     Are we; there is no last or first.\"    It shows what he might have accomplished, had longer life been but  allowed him.          CHAPTER XVI--STEVENSON'S GLOOM      The problem of Stevenson's gloom cannot be solved by any commonplace cut-  and-dried process.  It will remain a problem only unless (1) his original  dreamy tendency crossed, if not warped, by the fatalistic Calvinism which  was drummed into him by father, mother, and nurse in his tender years, is  taken fully into account; then (2) the peculiar action on such a nature  of the unsatisfying and, on the whole, distracting effect of the bohemian  and hail-fellow-well-met sort of ideal to which he yielded, and which has  to be charged with much; and (3) the conflict in him of a keenly social  animus with a very strong egotistical effusiveness, fed by fancy, and  nourished by the enforced solitariness inevitable in the case of one who,  from early years up, suffered from painful, and even crushing, disease.    His text and his sermon--which may be shortly summed in the following  sentence--be kind, for in kindness to others lies the only true pleasure  to be gained in life; be cheerful, even to the point of egotistic self-  satisfaction, for through cheerfulness only is the flow of this incessant  kindliness of thought and service possible.  He was not in harmony with  the actual effect of much of his creative work, though he illustrated  this in his life, as few men have done.  He regarded it as the highest  duty of life to give pleasure to others; his art in his own idea thus  became in an unostentatious way consecrated, and while he would not have  claimed to be a seer, any more than he would have claimed to be a saint,  as he would have held in contempt a mere sybarite, most certainly a vein  of unblamable hedonism pervaded his whole philosophy of life.  Suffering  constantly, he still was always kindly.  He encouraged, as Mr Gosse has  said, this philosophy by every resource open to him.  In practical life,  all who knew him declared that he was brightness, naive fancy, and  sunshine personified, and yet he could not help always, somehow, infusing  into his fiction a pronounced, and sometimes almost fatal, element of  gloom.  Even in his own case they were not pleasure-giving and failed  thus in essence.  Some wise critic has said that no man can ever write  well creatively of that in which in his early youth he had no knowledge.  Always behind Stevenson's latest exercises lies the shadow of this as an  unshifting background, which by art may be relieved, but never refined  away wholly.  He cannot escape from it if he would.  Here, too, as George  MacDonald has neatly and nicely said: We are the victims of our own past,  and often a hand is put forth upon us from behind and draws us into life  backward.  Here was Stevenson, with his half-hedonistic theories of life,  the duty of giving pleasure, of making eyes brighter, and casting  sunshine around one wherever one went, yet the creator of gloom for us,  when all the world was before him where to choose.

When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered  the village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he found all in  confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were  great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a  loud voice, \"What does your worship think can have befallen my master,  Senor Licentiate Pero Perez?\" for so the curate was called; \"it is three  days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the  buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as  true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he  has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his  reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying to himself that  he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world in quest of  adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought  to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!\"    The niece said the same, and, more: \"You must know, Master Nicholas\"--for  that was the name of the barber--\"it was often my uncle's way to stay two  days and nights together poring over these unholy books of misventures,  after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall  to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would say he had  killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed from him  when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in  battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm  and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion which the  sage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his, had brought him. But I  take all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my  uncle's vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before things had  come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books--for he has a great  number--that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.\"    \"So say I too,\" said the curate, \"and by my faith to-morrow shall not  pass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the  flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems  to have behaved.\"    All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was  the matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, \"Open, your  worships, to Senor Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, who comes  badly wounded, and to Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant  Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.\"    At these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their  friend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass  because he could not, they ran to embrace him.    \"Hold!\" said he, \"for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault; carry  me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to  my wounds.\"    \"See there! plague on it!\" cried the housekeeper at this: \"did not my  heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed with  your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without  fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more,  on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a  pass.\"    They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could  find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe  fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest  and the boldest to be found on earth.    \"So, so!\" said the curate, \"are there giants in the dance? By the sign of  the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day over.\"    They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all  was--give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what  he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at  great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the  nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the  licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to  summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don  Quixote's house.          CHAPTER VI.    OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER  MADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN      He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the  room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right  willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and  found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some  other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about  and ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy  water and a sprinkler, saying, \"Here, your worship, senor licentiate,  sprinkle this room; don't leave any magician of the many there are in  these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them  from the world.\"    The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he  directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they  were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not  deserve the penalty of fire.    \"No,\" said the niece, \"there is no reason for showing mercy to any of  them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out of  the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them;  or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without  the smoke giving any annoyance.\" The housekeeper said the same, so eager  were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the curate would  not agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles.    The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \"The four books of  Amadis of Gaul.\" \"This seems a mysterious thing,\" said the curate, \"for,  as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in  Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it  seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the  founder of so vile a sect.\"    \"Nay, sir,\" said the barber, \"I too, have heard say that this is the best  of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as  something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.\"    \"True,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason let its life be spared for  the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.\"    \"It is,\" said the barber, \"the 'Sergas de Esplandian,' the lawful son of  Amadis of Gaul.\"    \"Then verily,\" said the curate, \"the merit of the father must not be put  down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open the  window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for  the bonfire we are to make.\"    The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy  \"Esplandian\" went flying into the yard to await with all patience the  fire that was in store for him.    \"Proceed,\" said the curate.    \"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is 'Amadis of Greece,' and,  indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.\"    \"Then to the yard with the whole of them,\" said the curate; \"for to have  the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his  eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, I  would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in  the guise of a knight-errant.\"    \"I am of the same mind,\" said the barber.    \"And so am I,\" added the niece.    \"In that case,\" said the housekeeper, \"here, into the yard with them!\"    They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared  herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.    \"Who is that tub there?\" said the curate.    \"This,\" said the barber, \"is 'Don Olivante de Laura.'\"    \"The author of that book,\" said the curate, \"was the same that wrote 'The  Garden of Flowers,' and truly there is no deciding which of the two books  is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can say  is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.\"    \"This that follows is 'Florismarte of Hircania,'\" "]]]
