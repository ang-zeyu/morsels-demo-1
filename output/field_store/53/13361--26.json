Obviously the  continuous recurrence of the same changes, because by a constant  repetition they must of course lose their novelty.    [129] Presently we shall look into these characters more in detail and  then we shall find that they are not so simple as might be supposed at  first sight; but precisely because we are so familiar with them, we  readily see that their different features really belong to a single  character; while in elementary species everything is so new that it is  impossible for us to discern the unities of the new attributes.    If we bear in mind all these difficulties we cannot wonder at the  confusion on this question that seems to prevail everywhere. Some  authors following Linnaeus simply call all the subdivisions of species,  varieties; others follow Jordan and avoid the difficulty by designating  all smaller forms directly as species. The ablest systematists prefer to  consider the ordinary species as collective groups, calling their  constituents \"The elements of the species,\" as was done by A.P. De  Candolle, Alph. De Candolle and Lindley.    By this method they clearly point out the difference between the  subdivisions of wild species as they ordinarily occur, and the varieties  in our gardens, which would be very rare, were they not singled out and  preserved.    Our familiarity with a character and our grounds for calling it an old  acquaintance may result from two causes, which in judging a new [130]  variety are essentially different. The character in question may be  present in the given species or it may be lacking, but present in the  other group. In the first case a variety can only be formed by the loss  of the character, in the second case it arises by the addition of a new  one.    The first mode may be called a negative process, while the second is  then to be designated as positive. And as it is more easy to lose what  one has than to obtain something new, negative varieties are much more  common than are positive ones.    Let us now take an instance of a character that is apt to vary in both  ways, for this is obviously the best way of making clear what is meant  by a negative and a positive change.    In the family of the composites we find a group of genera with two forms  of florets on each flower-head. The hermaphrodite ones are tubular with  5, or rarely 4, equal teeth, and occupy the center of the head. These  are often called the flosculous florets or disk-florets. Those of the  circumference are ligulate and ordinarily unisexual, without stamens. In  many cases they are sterile, having only an imperfect ovary. They are  large and brightly colored and are generally designated as ray-florets.  As instances we may cite the camomile (_Anthemis nobilis_), the wild  camomile (_Matricaria Chamomilla_), [131] the yarrow (_Achillea  Millefolium_), the daisies, the Dahlia and many others. Species occur in  this group of plants from time to time that lack the ray-florets, as in  the tansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_) and some _artemisias_. And the genus of  the marigolds or _Bidens_ is noted for containing both of these types.  The smaller and the three-toothed marigold (_B. cernua_ and _B.  tripartita_) are very common plants of wet soil and swamps, ordinarily  lacking the ray-florets, and in some countries they are very abundant  and wholly constant in this respect, never forming radiate flower-heads.  On the other hand the white-flowered and the purple marigold (_B.  leucantha_ and _B. atropurpurea_) are cultivated species of our gardens,  prized for their showy flower-heads with large white or deeply colored,  nearly black-purple florets.    Here we have opportunity to observe positive and negative varieties of  the same character. The smaller, and the three-toothed marigold occur  from time to time, provided with ray florets, showing a positive  variation. And the white marigold has produced in our gardens a variety  without rays. Such varieties are quite constant, never returning to the  old species. Positive and negative varieties of this kind are by no  means rare among the compositae.    [132] In systematic works the positive ones are as a rule called  \"radiate,\" and the negative ones \"discoid.\" Discoid forms of the  ordinary camomile, of the daisy, of some asters (_Aster Tripolium_), and  of some centauries have been described. Radiate forms have been observed  in the tansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_), the common horse-weed or Canada  fleabane (_Erigeron canadensis_) and the common groundsel (_Senecio  vulgaris_). Taken broadly the negative varieties seem to be somewhat  more numerous than the positive ones, but it is very difficult to come  to a definite conclusion on this point.    Quite the contrary is the case with regard to the color-varieties of red  and blue flowers. Here the loss of color is so common that every one  could give long lists of examples of it. Linnaeus himself supposed that  no blue or red-colored wild species would be without a white variety. It  is well known that he founded his often criticized prescript never to  trust to color in recognizing or describing a species, on this belief.    On the other hand there are some red varieties of white-flowered  species. But they are very rare, and little is known about their  characters or constancy. Blue varieties of white species are not found.  The yarrow (_Achillea Millefolium_) has a red-flowered form, which  occurs [133] from time to time in sunny and sandy localities. I have  isolated it and cultivated it during a series of years and during many  generations. It is quite true to its character, but the degree of its  coloring fluctuates between pink and white and is extremely variable.  Perhaps it can be considered as an inconstant variety. A redflowered  form of the common _Begonia semperflorens_ is cultivated under the name  of \"Vernon,\" the white hawthorn (_Crataegus Oxyacantha_) is often seen  with red flowers, and a pink-flowered variety of the \"Silverchain\" or  \"Bastard acacia\" (_Robinia Pseud-Acacia_) is not rarely cultivated. The  \"Crown\" variety of the yellow wall-flower and the black varieties, are  also to be considered as positive color variations, the black being due  in the latter cases to a very great amount of the red pigment.    Among fruits there are also some positive red varieties of greenish or  yellowish species, as for instance the red gooseberry (_Ribes  Grossularia_) and the red oranges. The red hue is far more common in  leaves, as seen among herbs, in cultivated varieties of _Coleus_ and in  the brown leaved form of the ordinary white clover, among trees and  shrubs in the hazelnut (_Corylus_), the beech (_Fagus_), the birch  (_Betula_), the barberry (_Berberis_) and many others. But though most  of these forms are very ornamental and abundant [134] in parks and  gardens, little is as yet known concerning the origin of their varietal  attributes and their constancy, when propagated by seeds. Besides the  ray-florets and the colors, there are of course a great many other  characters in which varieties may differ from their species. In most of  the cases it is easy to discern whether the new character is a positive  or a negative one. And it is not at all necessary to scrutinize very  narrowly the list of forms to become convinced that the negative form is  the one which prevails nearly everywhere, and that positive aberrations  are in a general sense so rare that they might even be taken for  exceptions to the rule.    Many organs and many qualities may be lost in the origination of a  variety. In some instances the petals may disappear, as in _Nigella_, or  the stamens, as in the Guelder-rose (_Viburnum Opulus_) and the  _Hortensia_ and in some bulbs even the whole flowers may be wanting, as  in the beautiful \"Plumosa\" form of the cultivated grape-hyacinth or  _Muscari comosum_. Fruits of the pineapples and bananas without seeds  are on record as well as some varieties of apples and pears, of raisins  and oranges. And some years ago Mr. Riviere of Algeria described a date  growing in his garden that forms fruit without pits. The stoneless plum  of Mr. [135] Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, is also a very curious  variety, the kernel of which is fully developed but naked, no hard  substance intervening between it and the pulp.    More curious still are the unbranched varieties consisting of a single  stem, as may be seen sometimes in the corn or maize and in the fir.  Fir-trees of some three or four meters in height without a single  branch, wholly naked and bearing leaves only on the shoots of the last  year's growth at the apex of the tree, may be seen. Of course they  cannot bear seed, and so it is with the sterile maize, which never  produces any seed-spikes or staminate flowers. Other seedless varieties  can be propagated by buds; their origin is in most cases unknown, and we  are not sure as to whether they should be classified with the constant  or with the inconstant varieties.    A very curious loss is that of starch in the grains of the sugar-corn  and the sugar-peas. It is replaced by sugar or some allied substance  (dextrine). Equally remarkable is the loss of the runners in the  so-called \"Gaillon\" strawberries.    Among trees the pendulous or weeping, and the broomlike or fastigiate  forms are very marked varieties, which occur in species belonging to  quite different orders. The ash, the beach, some willows, many other  trees and some [136] finer species of garden-plants, as _Sophora  japonica_, have given rise to weeping varieties, and the yew-tree or  _Taxus_ has a fastigiate form which is much valued because of its  ascending branches and pyramidal habit. So it is with the pyramidal  varieties of oaks, elms, the bastard-acacia and some others.    It is generally acknowledged that these forms are to be considered as  varieties on the ground of their occurrence in so wide a range of  species, and because"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#19)"],[1,"of funds by the Dresdener Bank on the letters of credit and the  dispatching of special trains by the railroad department of the  German government. As a matter of fact, nothing more could have  been required of the Germans, as it was naturally the duty of  the American government to take care of its citizens stranded  abroad.    Almost the instant that war was declared, I cabled to our government  suggesting that a ship should be sent over with gold because,  of course, with gold, no matter what the country, necessaries  can always be bought. Rumours of the dispatch of the Tennessee  and other ships from America, reached Berlin and a great number  of the more ignorant of the Americans got to believe that these  ships were being sent over to take Americans home.    [Illustration: WORKING IN THE EMBASSY BALLROOM AT THE OUTBREAK  OF HOSTILITIES, AUGUST, 1914.]    [Illustration: WAR DAYS IN BERLIN. AMBASSADOR GERARD AND HIS STAFF.]    One morning an American woman spoke to me and said she would  consent to go home on one of these ships provided she was given  a state-room with a bath and Walker-Gordon milk for her children,  while another woman of German extraction used to sit for hours  in a corner of the ballroom, occasionally exclaiming aloud with  much feeling, \"O God, will them ships never come?\"    In these first days of the war we also made a card index of all  the Americans in Berlin, and, so far as possible, in Germany;  in order to weed out those who had received the passports in  the first days when possibly some people not entitled to them  received them, and to find the deserving cases. All Americans  were required to present themselves at the Embassy and answer  a few questions, after which, if everything seemed all right,  their passports were marked \"recommended for transportation to  America.\"    I sent out circulars from time to time to the consuls throughout  Germany giving general instructions with regard to the treatment  of Americans. The following circular sent out on August twelfth  is a sample:                    \"AMERICAN EMBASSY,                     BERLIN, August 12, 1914.      \"_To the Consular Representatives_      _of the United States in Germany,_        _and for the general information of_          _American Citizens._      \"A communication will to-morrow be published in the _Berlin    Lokal Anzeiger_ regarding the sending of a special train to    the Dutch frontier for the special conveyance of Americans.    Other trains will probably be arranged for from time to time.    No further news has been received regarding the sending of    transports from the United States, but applications for    repatriation are being considered by the Embassy and the    various consular offices throughout Germany according to the    Embassy's last circular and the announcements published in    the _Lokal Anzeiger_.      \"All Americans leaving Berlin must have their passports stamped    by the Foreign Office, for which purpose they should apply to    _Geheimer Legationsrat_ Dr. Eckhardt at Wilhelmstrasse    76. Americans residing outside of Berlin should ascertain from    their respective consular representatives what steps they should    take in this regard.      \"Letters for the United States may be sent to the Embassy and    will be forwarded at the first opportunity.      \"German subjects who desire to communicate with friends in    Great Britain, Russia, France or Belgium, or who desire to    send money, should make their requests to the Imperial Foreign    Office. Americans are permitted to enter Italy. The steamers    of the Italian lines are running at present, but are full for    some time in advance. The Embassy is also informed that the    steamer from Vlissingen, Holland, runs daily at 11 A. M. The    Ambassador cannot, however, recommend Americans to try to    reach Holland by the ordinary schedule trains, as he has    received reports of delays _en route_, owing to the fact    that all civil travellers are ejected from trains when troops    require accommodations. It is better to wait for special trains    arranged for by the Embassy.      \"The Dresdener Bank and its branches throughout Germany will    cash _for Americans only_ letters of credit and checks    issued by good American banks in limited amounts. Included    in this category are the checks of the Bankers' Association,    Bankers' Trust Company, International Mercantile Marine Company,    and American Express Company. All checks and letters of credit    must, however, be stamped by American consuls, and consuls must    see that the consular stamp is affixed to those checks and    letters of credit only as are the bona fide property of American    citizens. The Commerz & Disconto Bank makes the same offer and    the Deutsche Bank will cash checks and letters of credit drawn    by its correspondents.      \"American consular officers may also draw later on the Dresdener    Bank for their salaries and the official expenses of their    consulates. Before drawing such funds from the bank, however,    all consular officers should submit their expense accounts to me    for approval. These expense accounts should be transmitted to    the Embassy at the earliest opportunity.                             \"THE AMBASSADOR.\"    It will be noticed from the above circular that all Americans  were required to have their passports stamped at the Foreign  Office. One American did not receive back his passport, although  he had left it at the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office claimed  that it had delivered the passport to some one from the Embassy,  but we were not very much surprised when this identical passport  turned up later in the possession of Lodi, the confessed German  spy, who was shot in the Tower of London.    After a time the American Government cabled me to advance money  to destitute Americans; and the ladies in the ballroom, with  their assistants, attended to this branch, advancing money where  needed or so much as a person needed to make up the balance of  passage on steerage tickets from Holland to the United States.  At the same time we gradually built up a banking system. Those  in the United States who had friends or relatives in Germany  sent them money by giving the money to our State Department,  and the State Department in turn cabled me to make a payment.  This payment was made by my drawing a draft for the amount stated  on the State Department, the recipient selling this draft at a  fixed rate to the Deutsche Bank in Berlin. This business assumed  great proportions, and after the Americans who were in a hurry to  go home had disappeared, the ones remaining were kept in funds  by their friends and relatives through this sort of bank under  our management.    On August twenty-third, Assistant Secretary of War Breckenridge,  who had come from America on the warship _Tennessee_, bringing  gold with him, and a certain number of army officers, arrived  in Berlin and took over our relief organisation in so far as it  applied to the repatriation of Americans, housing it in rooms  hired in a nearby hotel, the Kaiserhoff. This commission: was  composed of Majors J. A. Ryan, J. H. Ford and G. W. Martin and  Captains Miller and Fenton, but the relief committee and the  banking office were still continued in the Embassy ballroom.    A bulletin was published under the auspices of the American  Association of Commerce and Trade and the advice there given was  that all Americans having the means to leave should do so when  the opportunity for leaving by special trains was presented, and  proceed direct to London whence they could obtain transportation  to the United States. All Americans without means were directed  to apply to the relief commission which was authorized to pay  for the transportation and subsistence of stranded Americans  in order to enable them to return home.    The enormous quantity of baggage left behind by Americans in  Germany was a problem requiring solution.    In spite of repeated advice to leave, many Americans insisted  on remaining in Germany. Few of them were business people; there  were many song-birds, piano players, and students. We had much  trouble with these belated Americans. For example, one woman  and her daughter refused to leave when advised, but stayed on  and ran up bills for over ten thousand marks; and as arrest for  debt exists in Germany, they could not leave when they finally  decided to go. All of us in the Embassy had to subscribe the  money necessary to pay their most pressing debts and they finally  left the country, leaving an added prejudice against Americans.          CHAPTER X    PRISONERS OF WAR    During the period of the first months of the war, in addition  to other work, it became necessary to look after those subjects  of other nations who had been confided to my care.    At first the British were allowed considerable liberty, although  none were permitted to leave the country. They were required to  report to the police at stated times during the day and could  not remain out late at night.    The Japanese had received warning from their Embassy as to the  turn that events might take and, before sending its ultimatum,  the Japanese government had warned its citizens, so that a great  number of them had left Germany. After the declaration of war by  Japan, all the Japanese in Germany were immediately imprisoned.  This was stated to be in order to save them from the fury of  the population and certainly the people seemed to be greatly  incensed against the Japanese. When I finally obtained permission  for their release and departure from Germany I had to send some  one with the parties of Japanese to the Swiss frontier in order  to protect them from injury. They were permitted to leave only  through Switzerland and, therefore, had to change cars at Munich.  Before sending any of them to Munich I invariably telegraphed  our Consul there to notify the Munich police"]]]
