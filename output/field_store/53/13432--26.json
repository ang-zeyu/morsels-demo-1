Perhaps the priests  really meant well in keeping the secret of the One God for themselves  and the kings, as the people weren't fitted to bear its solemnity.  Fancy how amusing it was for the children to be told, on silver-bright  nights, about Khonsu, god of the moon, always young, wearing the curled  lock of youth on his brow--who staked five nights of his light playing  draughts with Thoth, father of Magic. But he had a more serious phase,  for when he was not a gambler he was an Expeller of Demons, a most  popular accomplishment. Indeed, almost every god had several thriving  businesses, conducted under different aliases. Khnum the Creator,  dweller at the Cataracts, is my favourite, and is still busy, as he  looks after the rise and fall of the river. Hekt, goddess of birth, was  a pal of his, in spite of her appalling ugliness; and she used to kneel  by his potter's wheel. While he fashioned the clay she would hold the  Sign of Life, so that spirit might enter into the formed body when  Khnum got it to the right state. For very important babies, royal ones  or geniuses, she held a Sign of Life in each hand, which made them  extraordinarily vital. When you arrive in Egypt, the first thing you'll  be asked to buy will be the Sign, or Key of Life, in the shape of paper  knives or brooches or what not, and it will be pointed out to you in  tombs till you're tired and sick of it. You can buy Hekt, too, and  funny old Bes, nurse-goddess of children, quite the golliwog of her  day; and all the other gods and goddesses will be offered to you, to  say nothing of the kings who were entitled to worship themselves as  gods if they wanted to.    \"It's easy, you see, to make fun of the ancient religion, and other  nations did make fun of it. But to be serious, the priests were nearer  right than it would seem; for they believed that God was All: that  there was nothing in this or any Universe which was not part of God.\"    That note was my highest, and I stopped on it. Besides, I could think  of nothing more to say. I ventured to sit down; and because the people  were glad to hear the last of me, or because I had helped them finish  their almonds and raisins, they applauded. Secretly I shook hands with  myself, as the monkey must have done, when, with the catspaw, he had  pulled the hot chestnuts out of the fire. I had carefully selected my  chestnuts--and waited till they were cool. Also, I had disappointed  Colonel Corkran.          CHAPTER IX    WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MY BACK WAS TURNED      Three letters for me, brought out by the pilot! One I had expected from  Anthony; but my heart gave a bound as I recognized Brigit's  handwriting, not seen for years; and instinct told me that the third  was from Monny Gilder.    My one thought for the last two days, steaming back from the Piraeus to  Alexandria, had been that I was drawing nearer to Cairo, and to those  whose doings in my absence pulled at my curiosity and keyed my interest  to breaking point. But if you think that I tore open those envelopes  and greedily absorbed their contents the moment they were put into my  hands, you have never been a conductor or even an observant passenger  on a \"pleasure yacht.\" When the letters arrived I was engaged in  persuading breakfast-lingerers (they of the eggs-and-bacon habit, who  ought never to leave their peaceful English homes) that it would give  them more real pleasure to be first in the shore boats than last at the  table. Then to get them into the boats; then to hypnotize Lady Biddell  and Mrs. Harlow into the belief that they would not, could not, be  seasick on the dancing waves which bobbed us up and down. No time to  think of the letters; much less to feel the strangeness of fate which  brought me back in such queer circumstances to the port I had entered  on the _Laconia_ eight days ago.    \"As soon as we get on shore,\" I soothed my gnawing impatience, \"I'll  steal a minute somehow.\" But each moment was so conspicuously labelled  that I could not be a thief of time--my time, which was my charges'  time, bought and paid for by Sir Marcus Lark.    This was not the first occasion on which I'd heard the clanking of my  chains, for, although I flattered myself that I was a popular success,  popularity had penalties. On the night of the lecture I had used the  passengers. Since then they had used me. Old ladies appealed to me on  questions of etiquette, health or religion, and retailed my answers,  not always correctly. Girls asked my advice about keeping up  flirtations, and men wanted my help in getting out of them. I was  expected to spout pages of Strabo or Pliny at an instant's notice; I  must know why Plato went to Egypt, or how long he stayed; and be umpire  between American and British bridge-players. I must be able to explain  the true meaning and age of the Sphinx; invent new deck games; and show  those who hadn't learned, how to dance the Tango. But with those three  letters burning over my heart the duties of conductor became  infuriating.    It was an awful day; for what was Pompey's Pillar to me while I  remained ignorant of my friends' adventures? As I discoursed (more or  less) learnedly about Diocletian, and Ptolemy's plot to drown Pompey in  the Nile, something inside was asking, \"Has Anthony fallen in love with  Monny Gilder?\" \"What scrapes has that blessed girl got into?\" \"Has  anything happened to worry Biddy?\" Even that nameless but incomparable  tomb on the hill of Kom esh-Shukafa could not distract my thoughts from  the sealed envelopes; and three very modern handwritings came  obstinately between my eyes and the matchless wall-paintings--paintings  as fresh in their underground hiding-place as if finished yesterday  instead of in days when it was dowdy to be pagan, fashionable to be  Christian.    Corkran, as a soldier, had to guide a band to Aboukir, and chat about  Nelson; point out the medieval fort of Kait Bey, and dash with hired  motors to Adjemi, where Napoleon landed. Kruger took a few studious  pilgrims to that unspoiled Oriental Nile town where the Rosetta Stone  gave the secrets of Ancient Egypt to the world. It was mine to pilot  the \"frivolous lot\"; to escort them in carriages round the  Italian-looking city when they had absorbed its two chief sights; to give  them a glimpse of the Museum, and to let them see the beauty and fashion  of Alexandria driving out to San Stefano in the late afternoon. Still I  had no chance to read my letters; but, thought I at the hotel, \"Now at  last, it has come!\" Not at all! People's trunks were missing, or in the  wrong rooms. It was I who had to sooth alarms, and calm rising storms.  It was I who must assure Mrs. Harlow that her room was really  preferable to that of Lady Biddell; and Lady Biddell that she, and not  Miss Hassett-Bean, had the best in the hotel. Still, I had ten minutes  to dress for dinner. Like Mr. Gladstone, I could do it in five, and  have five left for my letters. But hardly had I slipped a paper knife  under the flap of Monny's envelope (I should have felt a vandal to tear  it) when one of the hotel managers knocked at my door. A gentleman was  being very angry in the dining-room. He insisted on seeing me. He said  he had been Lord Mayor of London, and ought to have a window-table. All  these were previously engaged. What was to be done? Would I kindly come  at once?    I persuaded Sir John that window-tables were the least desirable, owing  to draughts, and returning to my room, had four minutes to dress or  risk further rows. After dinner Miss Hassett-Bean burst into tears  because she was alone in the world owing to the marmoset's death from  seasickness; and now that she was growing old nobody cared to talk to  her. I argued that people were shy because she was more important than  they, and had a reputation for satire. It took half an hour for the  lady's nose to go from red to pink (I think she had papier poudre in  her handkerchief); and then I was obliged to walk on the beach with  Miss Enid Biddell to keep Mr. Watts from proposing. As Snell relieved  me from sentry duty, I was called by Kruger to discuss certain details  of next morning's start for Cairo; and at midnight, when I crawled to  my room a shattered wreck, the letters were still unread.    \"I'm incapable of caring now,\" I groaned, \"what has happened to any of  them. If an earthquake has swallowed up our mountain, and Anthony's  married Monny, and Brigit's been abducted, or vice versa, and Miss  Guest has gone off with the jewels, it will leave me calm.\"    That was the spirit in which I tossed up a coin to see which letter to  read first. Heads, Monny's; tails, Anthony's; but the penny rolled  away, far under the bed where collar-buttons go, and so--I opened  Biddy's. She began:    MY DEAR GOOD DUFFER!    For any sake hurry back. Make an excuse to leave your pilgrims the  minute you get this, and take the first train to Cairo. Surely the late  conductor can be your understudy, and trot the people round Alexandria  for a day? We need you more than they do. I picture you reading this  early in the morning, with Alexandria still in the distance; for you  said you'd arrange to have letters come out to the yacht by the pilot.  I shall expect a telegram saying by what train you'll arrive here in  the afternoon. You'll understand when I've told you everything, why  it's _necessary_ for you to hurry.    We have done and seen so many things, it seems years instead of days  since you left us in care of that handsome Hadji of yours. I wonder if  really you didn't suspect that I guessed who he was; or _did_ you  suspect; and didn't care? I caught the look in your eyes, when you  first saw him standing under the terrace at Shepheard's, and then, when  the name \"Antoun Effendi\" came up in the conversation, I put two and  two together.

It may be that I made my report with too much  gusto when my chance came; at any rate, it was only the fact that  appeared to interest Miss Belsize; the details, over which I gloated,  seemed to inspire in her a repugnance consistent with the prejudice she  had displayed against Raffles yesterday, but not with her grateful  solicitude on his behalf as revealed to me that very morning. I could  only feel that gratitude was the beginning and the end of her new regard  for him. Raffles had never fascinated this young girl as he did the rest  of us; ordinarily engaged to an ordinary man, she was proof against the  glamour that dazzled us. Nay, though she would not admit it even to me  his friend, though like Levy she pretended to embrace the theory of the  practical joke, making it the pretext for her anxiety, I felt more  certain than ever that she now guessed, and had long suspected, what  manner of man Raffles really was, and that her natural antipathy was  greater even than before. Still more certain was I that she would never  betray him by word or deed; that, whatever harm might come of his present  proceedings, it would not be through Camilla Belsize.    But I was now determined to do my own utmost to minimise the dangers, to  be a real help to Raffles in the act of altruistic depravity to which he  had committed himself, and not merely a fifth wheel to his dashing  chariot. Accordingly I went into solemn training for the event before us:  a Turkish bath on the Saturday, a quiet Sunday between Mount Street and  the club, and most of Monday lying like a log in cold-blooded preparation  for the night's work. And when night fell I took it upon me to  reconnoitre the ground myself before meeting Raffles at Waterloo.    Another cool and starry evening seemed to have tempted all the town and  his wife into the streets. The great streams of traffic were busier than  ever, the backwaters emptier, and Gray's Inn a basin drained to the last  dreg of visible humanity. In one moment I passed through gateway and  alley from the voices and lights of Holborn into a perfectly deserted  square of bare ground and bright stars. The contrast was altogether  startling, for I had never been there before; but for the same reason I  had already lost my bearings, believing myself to be in Gray's Inn Square  when I was only in South Square, Gray's Inn. Here I entered upon a  hopeless search for the offices of Burroughs and Burroughs. Door after  door had I tried in vain, and was beginning to realise my mistake, when a  stray molecule of the population drifted in from Holborn as I had done,  but with the quick step of the man who knows his way. I darted from a  doorway to inquire mine, but he was across the square before I could cut  him off, and as he passed through the rays of a lamp beside a second  archway, I fell back thanking Providence and Raffles for my rubber soles.  The man had neither seen nor heard me, but at the last moment I had  recognised him as the burlier of the two blockheads who had shadowed  Raffles three days before.    He passed under the arch without looking round. I flattened myself  against the wall on my side of the arch; and in so standing I was all  but eye-witness of a sudden encounter in the square beyond.    The quick steps stopped, and there was a \"Here you are!\" on one side,  and a \"Well! Where is he?\" on the other, both very eager and below  the breath.    \"On the job,\" whispered the first voice. \"Up to the neck!\"    \"When did 'e go in?\"    \"Nearly an hour ago; when I sent the messenger.\"    \"Which way?\"    \"Up through number seventeen.\"    \"Next door, eh?\"    \"That's right.\"    \"Over the roof?\"    \"Can't say; he's left no tracks. I been up to see.\"    \"I suppose there's the usual ladder and trapdoor?\"    \"Yes, but the ladder's hanging in its proper place. He couldn't have put  it back there, could he?\"    The other grunted; presently he expressed a doubt whether Raffles (and it  thrilled me to hear the very name) had succeeded in breaking into the  lawyer's office at all. The first man on the scene, however, was quite  sure of it--and so was I.    \"And we've got to hang about,\" grumbled the newcomer, \"till he comes  out again?\"    \"That's it. We can't miss him. He must come back into the square or  through into the gardens, and if he does that he'll have to come over  these here railings into Field Court. We got him either way, and there's  a step just here where we can sit and see both ways as though it had been  made for us. You come and try ... a door into the old hall ...\"    That was all I heard distinctly; first their footsteps, and then the few  extra yards, made the rest unintelligible. But I had heard enough. \"The  usual ladder and trap-door!\" Those blessed words alone might prove worth  their weight in great letters of solid gold.    Now I could breathe again; now I relaxed my body and turned my head, and  peered through the arch with impunity, and along the whole western side  of Gray's Inn Square, with its dusky fringe of plane-trees and its vivid  line of lamps, its strip of pavement, and its wall of many-windowed  houses under one unbroken roof. Dim lights smouldered in the column of  landing windows over every door; otherwise there was no break in the  blackness of that gaunt facade. Yet in some dark room or other behind  those walls I seemed to see Raffles at work as plainly as I had just  heard our natural enemies plotting his destruction. I saw him at a safe.  I saw him at a desk. I saw him leaving everything as he had found it,  only to steal down and out into the very arms of the law. And I felt that  even that desperate _denouement_ was little more than he deserved for  letting me think myself accessory before the fact, when all the time he  meant me to have nothing whatever to do with it! Well, I should have  everything to do with it now; if Raffles was to be saved from the  consequences of his own insanity, I and I alone must save him. It was the  chance of my life to show him my real worth. And yet the difficulty of  the thing might have daunted Raffles himself.    I knew what to do if only I could gain the house which he had made the  base of his own operations; at least I knew what to attempt, and what  Raffles had done I might do. So far the wily couple within earshot had  helped me out of their own mouths. But they were only just round the  corner that hid them from my view; stray words still reached me; and they  knew me by sight, would recognise me at a glance, might pounce upon me as  I passed. Unless--    _I_ had it!    The crowd in Holborn seemed strange and unreal as I jostled in its midst  once more. I was out of it in a moment, however, and into a 'bus, and out  of the 'bus in a couple of minutes by my watch. One more minute and I was  seeing how far back I could sit in a hansom bound for Gray's Inn Square.    \"I forget the number,\" I had told the cabman, \"but it's three or four  doors beyond Burroughs and Burroughs, the solicitors.\"    The gate into Holborn had to be opened for me, but the gate-keeper had  not seen me on my previous entrance and exit afoot through the postern.  It was when we drove under the further arch into the actual square that I  pressed my head hard against the back of the hansom, and turned my face  towards Field Court. The enemy might have abandoned their position, they  might meet me face to face as I landed on the pavement; that was my risk,  and I ran it without disaster. We passed the only house with an outer  door to it in the square (now there is none), and on the plate beside it  I read BURROUGHS AND BURROUGHS with a thrill. Up went my stick; my  shilling (with a peculiarly superfluous sixpence for luck) I thrust  through the trap with the other hand; and I was across the pavement, and  on the stairs four clear doors beyond the lawyer's office, before the  driver had begun to turn his horse.    They were broad bare stairs, with great office doors right and left on  every landing, and in the middle the landing window looking out into the  square. I waited well within the window on the first floor; and as my  hansom drove out under the arch, the light of its near lamp flashed  across two figures lounging on the steps of that entrance to the hall;  but there was no stopping or challenging the cabman, no sound at all but  those of hoofs and bell, and soon only that of my own heart beating as I  fled up the rest of the stairs in my rubber soles.    Near the top I paused to thank my kindly stars; sure enough there was a  long step-ladder hanging on a great nail over the last half-landing, and  a square trap-door right over the landing proper! I ran up just to see  the names on the two top doors; one was evidently that of some  pettifogging firm of solicitors, while the other bespoke a private  resident, whom I judged to be out of town by the congestion of postal  matter that met my fingers in his letter-box. Neither had any terrors for  me. The step-ladder was unhooked without another moment's hesitation.  Care alone was necessary to place it in position without making a noise;  then up I went, and up went the trapdoor next, without mishap or  hindrance until I tried to stand up in the loft, and caught my head a  crack against the tiles instead.    This was disconcerting in more ways than one, for I could not leave the  ladder where it was, and it was nearly twice my height. I struck a match  and lit up a sufficient perspective of lumber and cobwebs to reassure me.  The loft was long enough, and the trap-door plumb under the apex of the  roof, whereas I had stepped sideways off the ladder. It was to be got up,  and I got it up, though not by any means as silently as I could have  wished. I knelt and listened at the open trap-door for a good minute  before closing it with great caution, a squeak and a scuttle in the loft  itself being the only sign that I had disturbed a living creature.
