Good,  quiet, uncomplaining mother Nature, long slighted and miscalled, still  bides her time and draws to her bosom the most errant of her children.    The two walked swiftly across the meadow to the narrow bridge, he in  front and she a pace or two behind. There they paused, and stood for  a few minutes face to face talking earnestly. Alleyne had read and  had heard of love and of lovers. Such were these, doubtless--this  golden-bearded man and the fair damsel with the cold, proud face. Why  else should they wander together in the woods, or be so lost in talk by  rustic streams? And yet as he watched, uncertain whether to advance from  the cover or to choose some other path to the house, he soon came  to doubt the truth of this first conjecture. The man stood, tall and  square, blocking the entrance to the bridge, and throwing out his hands  as he spoke in a wild eager fashion, while the deep tones of his stormy  voice rose at times into accents of menace and of anger. She stood  fearlessly in front of him, still stroking her bird; but twice she threw  a swift questioning glance over her shoulder, as one who is in search  of aid. So moved was the young clerk by these mute appeals, that he came  forth from the trees and crossed the meadow, uncertain what to do, and  yet loth to hold back from one who might need his aid. So intent were  they upon each other that neither took note of his approach; until, when  he was close upon them, the man threw his arm roughly round the damsel's  waist and drew her towards him, she straining her lithe, supple figure  away and striking fiercely at him, while the hooded hawk screamed with  ruffled wings and pecked blindly in its mistress's defence. Bird and  maid, however, had but little chance against their assailant who,  laughing loudly, caught her wrist in one hand while he drew her towards  him with the other.    \"The best rose has ever the longest thorns,\" said he. \"Quiet, little  one, or you may do yourself a hurt. Must pay Saxon toll on Saxon land,  my proud Maude, for all your airs and graces.\"    \"You boor!\" she hissed. \"You base underbred clod! Is this your care and  your hospitality? I would rather wed a branded serf from my father's  fields. Leave go, I say----Ah! good youth, Heaven has sent you. Make him  loose me! By the honor of your mother, I pray you to stand by me and to  make this knave loose me.\"    \"Stand by you I will, and that blithely,\" said Alleyne. \"Surely, sir,  you should take shame to hold the damsel against her will.\"    The man turned a face upon him which was lion-like in its strength and  in its wrath. With his tangle of golden hair, his fierce blue eyes, and  his large, well-marked features, he was the most comely man whom Alleyne  had ever seen, and yet there was something so sinister and so fell in  his expression that child or beast might well have shrunk from him. His  brows were drawn, his cheek flushed, and there was a mad sparkle in his  eyes which spoke of a wild, untamable nature.    \"Young fool!\" he cried, holding the woman still to his side, though  every line of her shrinking figure spoke her abhorrence. \"Do you keep  your spoon in your own broth. I rede you to go on your way, lest worse  befall you. This little wench has come with me and with me she shall  bide.\"    \"Liar!\" cried the woman; and, stooping her head, she suddenly bit  fiercely into the broad brown hand which held her. He whipped it back  with an oath, while she tore herself free and slipped behind Alleyne,  cowering up against him like the trembling leveret who sees the falcon  poising for the swoop above him.    \"Stand off my land!\" the man said fiercely, heedless of the blood which  trickled freely from his fingers. \"What have you to do here? By your  dress you should be one of those cursed clerks who overrun the land like  vile rats, poking and prying into other men's concerns, too caitiff to  fight and too lazy to work. By the rood! if I had my will upon ye, I  should nail you upon the abbey doors, as they hang vermin before their  holes. Art neither man nor woman, young shaveling. Get thee back to thy  fellows ere I lay hands upon you: for your foot is on my land, and I may  slay you as a common draw-latch.\"    \"Is this your land, then?\" gasped Alleyne.    \"Would you dispute it, dog? Would you wish by trick or quibble to juggle  me out of these last acres? Know, base-born knave, that you have dared  this day to stand in the path of one whose race have been the advisers  of kings and the leaders of hosts, ere ever this vile crew of Norman  robbers came into the land, or such half-blood hounds as you were let  loose to preach that the thief should have his booty and the honest man  should sin if he strove to win back his own.\"    \"You are the Socman of Minstead?\"    \"That am I; and the son of Edric the Socman, of the pure blood of  Godfrey the thane, by the only daughter of the house of Aluric, whose  forefathers held the white-horse banner at the fatal fight where our  shield was broken and our sword shivered. I tell you, clerk, that my  folk held this land from Bramshaw Wood to the Ringwood road; and, by the  soul of my father! it will be a strange thing if I am to be bearded upon  the little that is left of it. Begone, I say, and meddle not with my  affair.\"    \"If you leave me now,\" whispered the woman, \"then shame forever upon  your manhood.\"    \"Surely, sir,\" said Alleyne, speaking in as persuasive and soothing a  way as he could, \"if your birth is gentle, there is the more reason that  your manners should be gentle too. I am well persuaded that you did but  jest with this lady, and that you will now permit her to leave your land  either alone or with me as a guide, if she should need one, through the  wood. As to birth, it does not become me to boast, and there is sooth in  what you say as to the unworthiness of clerks, but it is none the less  true that I am as well born as you.\"    \"Dog!\" cried the furious Socman, \"there is no man in the south who can  say as much.\"    \"Yet can I,\" said Alleyne smiling; \"for indeed I also am the son of  Edric the Socman, of the pure blood of Godfrey the thane, by the only  daughter of Aluric of Brockenhurst. Surely, dear brother,\" he continued,  holding out his hand, \"you have a warmer greeting than this for me.  There are but two boughs left upon this old, old Saxon trunk.\"    His elder brother dashed his hand aside with an oath, while an  expression of malignant hatred passed over his passion-drawn features.  \"You are the young cub of Beaulieu, then,\" said he. \"I might have known  it by the sleek face and the slavish manner too monk-ridden and craven  in spirit to answer back a rough word. Thy father, shaveling, with all  his faults, had a man's heart; and there were few who could look him in  the eyes on the day of his anger. But you! Look there, rat, on yonder  field where the cows graze, and on that other beyond, and on the orchard  hard by the church. Do you know that all these were squeezed out of  your dying father by greedy priests, to pay for your upbringing in the  cloisters? I, the Socman, am shorn of my lands that you may snivel Latin  and eat bread for which you never did hand's turn. You rob me first, and  now you would come preaching and whining, in search mayhap of another  field or two for your priestly friends. Knave! my dogs shall be set upon  you; but, meanwhile, stand out of my path, and stop me at your peril!\"  As he spoke he rushed forward, and, throwing the lad to one side, caught  the woman's wrist. Alleyne, however, as active as a young deer-hound,  sprang to her aid and seized her by the other arm, raising his iron-shod  staff as he did so.    \"You may say what you will to me,\" he said between his clenched  teeth--\"it may be no better than I deserve; but, brother or no, I swear  by my hopes of salvation that I will break your arm if you do not leave  hold of the maid.\"    There was a ring in his voice and a flash in his eyes which promised  that the blow would follow quick at the heels of the word. For a moment  the blood of the long line of hot-headed thanes was too strong for the  soft whisperings of the doctrine of meekness and mercy. He was conscious  of a fierce wild thrill through his nerves and a throb of mad gladness  at his heart, as his real human self burst for an instant the bonds  of custom and of teaching which had held it so long. The socman sprang  back, looking to left and to right for some stick or stone which might  serve him for weapon; but finding none, he turned and ran at the top of  his speed for the house, blowing the while upon a shrill whistle.    \"Come!\" gasped the woman. \"Fly, friend, ere he come back.\"    \"Nay, let him come!\" cried Alleyne. \"I shall not budge a foot for him or  his dogs.\"    \"Come, come!\" she cried, tugging at his arm. \"I know the man: he will  kill you. Come, for the Virgin's sake, or for my sake, for I cannot go  and leave you here.\"    \"Come, then,\" said he; and they ran together to the cover of the woods.  As they gained the edge of the brushwood, Alleyne, looking back, saw his  brother come running out of the house again, with the sun gleaming upon  his hair and his beard. He held something which flashed in his right  hand, and he stooped at the threshold to unloose the black hound.    \"This way!\" the woman whispered, in a low eager voice. \"Through the  bushes to that forked ash. Do not heed me; I can run as fast as you, I  trow. Now into the stream--right in, over ankles, to throw the dog off,  though I think it is but a common cur, like its master.\" As she spoke,  she sprang herself into the shallow stream and ran swiftly up the  centre of it, with the brown water bubbling over her feet and her  hand out-stretched toward the clinging branches of bramble or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#19)"],[1,"who, in a burst of  gratitude, hit upon this sublime sentence? Certain it is that later on  Augustin saw in his mother's tears as it were a first baptism whence he  came forth regenerate. After having borne him according to the flesh,  Monnica, by her tears and moans, gave him birth into the spiritual life.  Monnica wept because of Augustin. Monnica wept for Augustin. This is rather  astonishing in the case of so severe a mother--this African a trifle  rough. The expressions--tears and moans and weeping--occur so often in  her son's writings, that we are at first tempted to take them for pious  metaphors--figures of a sacred rhetoric. We suspect that Monnica's tears  must come from the Bible, an imitation of King David's penitential tears.  But it would be quite an error to believe that. Monnica wept real tears.  In her whole-hearted prayers she bedewed the pavement of the basilica; she  moistened the balustrade against which she leant her forehead. This austere  woman, this widow whose face nobody saw any more, whose body was shapeless  by reason of the mass of stuffs, grey and black, which wrapped her from  head to foot--this rigid Christian concealed a heart full of love. Love  such as this was then a perfectly new thing.    That an African woman should carry her piety to the point of fanaticism;  that she should work to conquer her son to her faith; that, if he strayed  from it, she should hate him and drive him out with curses--this has been  seen in Africa at all times. But that a mother should mourn at the thought  that her child is lost for another life; that she grows terror-stricken and  despairing when she thinks that she may possess a happiness in which he  will have no part, and walk in the gardens of Heaven while her child will  not be there--no, this had never been seen before. \"Where I am you will  be,\" near me, against my heart, our two hearts meeting in the one same  love--in this union of souls, continued beyond the grave, lies all the  Christian sweetness and hope.    Augustin was no longer, or not yet, a Christian. But in his tears he is  the true son of his mother. This gift of tears that Saint Lewis of France  begged God with so much earnestness and contrition to grant him, Monnica's  son had to the full. \"For him to weep was a pleasure.\" [1] He inebriated  himself with his tears. Now, just while he was at Thagaste, he lost a  friend whom he loved intensely. This death set free the fountain of tears.  They are not yet the holy tears which he will shed later before God, but  only poor human tears, more pathetic perhaps to our own weakness.    [Footnote 1: Sainte-Beuve.]    Who was this friend? He tells us in very vague terms. We only know that  they had grown up as boys together and had gone to the same schools; that  they had just passed a year together, probably at Carthage; that this young  man, persuaded by him, was become a Manichee; and that, in a word, they  loved passionately. Augustin, while speaking of him, recalls in a deeper  sense what Horace said of his friend Virgil: _dimidium animae_--\"O thou half  of my soul!\"    Well, this young man fell gravely sick of a fever. As all hope was at an  end, they baptized him, according to the custom. He grew better, was almost  cured, \"As soon as I was able to talk to him,\" says Augustin--\"and that was  as soon as he could bear it, for I never left his side, and we were bound  up in one another--I ventured a jest, thinking that he would jest too,  about the baptism which he had received, when he could neither think nor  feel. But by this time he had been told of his baptism. He shrank from  me as from an enemy, and with a wonderful new-found courage, warned me  never to speak so to him again, if I wished to remain his friend. I was  so astounded and confused that I said no more, resolving to wait till  he should regain his strength, _when I would tell him frankly what I  thought_.\"    So, at this serious moment, he whom they called \"the Carthaginian disputer\"  was sorry not to be able to measure himself in a bout of dialectics with  his half-dead friend. The intellectual poison had so perverted his mind,  that it almost destroyed in him the feelings of common decency. But if his  head, as he acknowledges, was very much spoiled, his heart remained intact.  His friend died a few days after, and Augustin was not there. He was  stunned by it.    His grief wrought itself up to wildness and despair. \"This sorrow fell like  darkness on my heart, and wherever I looked I saw nothing but death. My  country became a torture, my father's house a misery. All the pleasures  that I had shared with him, turned into hideous anguish now that he was  gone. My eyes sought for him everywhere, and found him not. I hated the  familiar scenes because he was not there, and they could no more cry to  me, 'Lo! he will come.' as they used when he was absent but alive....\"  Then Augustin began to weep louder, he prolonged his weeping, finding  consolation only in tears. Monnica's tenderness was restrained; in him it  was given full vent and exaggerated. At that time, the Christian moderation  was unknown to him, as well as the measure which the good taste of the  ancients prompted. He has often been compared to the most touching  geniuses, to Virgil, to Racine, who had also the gift of tears. But  Augustin's tenderness is more abandoned, and, so to speak, more romantic.  It even works up, sometimes, into an unhealthy excitement.    To be full of feeling, as Augustin was then, is not only to feel with  excessive sensitiveness the least wounds, the slightest touches of love or  hate, nor is it only to give oneself with transport; but it is especially  to take delight in the gift of oneself, to feel at the moment of full  abandonment that one is communicating with something infinitely sweet,  which already has ceased to be the creature loved. It is love for love, it  is to weep for the pleasure of tears, it is to mix with tenderness a kind  of egoism avid of experiences. Having lost his friend, Augustin loathes all  the world. He repeats: \"Tears were my only comfort. I was wretched, and  my wretchedness was dear to me.\" And accordingly, he did not want to be  consoled. But as, little by little, the terrors of that parting subsided,  he perceived himself that he played with grief and made a joy of his  tears. \"My tears,\" he says, \"were dearer to me than my friend had been.\"  By degrees the friend is almost forgotten. Though Augustin may hate life  because his friend has gone, he confesses naively that he would not have  sacrificed his existence for the sake of the dead. He surmises that what  is told of Orestes and Pylades contending to die for each other is but a  fable. Ultimately, he comes to write: \"Perhaps I feared to die, _lest the  other half of him whom I had loved so dearly, should perish_.\" He himself,  in his _Retractations_, condemns this phrase as pure rhetoric. It remains  true that what was perhaps the deepest sorrow of his life--this sorrow so  sincere and painful which had \"rent and bloodied his soul\"--ended with a  striking phrase.    It should be added, that in a stormy nature like his, grief, like love,  wears itself out quickly. It burns up passion and sentiment as it does  ideas. When at length he regained his calm, everything appeared drab.  Thagaste became intolerable. With his impulsive temperament, his changeable  humour, he all at once hit upon a plan: To go back to Carthage and open a  rhetoric school. Perhaps, too, the woman he loved and had abandoned there  was pressing him to return. Perhaps she told him that she was about to  become a mother. Always ready to go away, Augustin scarcely hesitated.  It is more than likely that he did not consult Monnica. He only told  Romanianus, who, as he had all kinds of reasons for wanting to keep  Augustin at Thagaste, at first strongly objected. But the young man pointed  to his future, his ambition to win fame. Was he going to bury all that in a  little town?    Romanianus yielded, and with a generosity that is no longer seen, he paid  the expenses this time too.          V    THE SILENCE OF GOD      Augustin was going to live nine years at Carthage--nine years that he  squandered in obscure tasks, in disputes sterile or unfortunate for himself  and others--briefly, in an utter forgetfulness of his true vocation. \"And  during this time Thou wert silent, O my God!\" he cries, in recalling only  the faults of his early youth. Now, the silence of God lay heavy. And yet  even in those years his tormented soul had not ceased to appeal. \"Where  wert Thou then, O my God, while I looked for Thee? Thou wert before me. But  I had drawn away from myself and I could not find myself. How much less,  then, could I find Thee.\"    This was certainly the most uneasy, and, at moments, the most painful time  of his life. Hardly was he got back to Carthage than he had to struggle  against ever-increasing money difficulties. Not only had he to get his  own living, but the living of others--possibly his mother's and that of  his brother and sister--at all events, he had to support his mistress and  the child. It is possible that the infant was born before its father left  Thagaste; if not, the birth must have occurred shortly after.    The child was called Adeodatus. There is a kind of irony in this name,  which was then usual, of Adeodatus--\"Gift of God.\" This son of his sin, as  Augustin calls him, this son whom he did not want, and the news of whose  birth must have been a painful shock--this poor child was a gift of Heaven  which the father could have well done without. And then, when he saw him,  he was filled with joy, and he cherished him as a real gift from God.    He accepted his fatherhood courageously, and, as it happens in such  cases, he was drawn closer to his mistress, their association taking on  something of conjugal dignity. Did the mother of Adeodatus justify such  attachment--an attachment which was "]]]
