When the sun  shone it appeared but a pale image of itself, and old pagazis, wise in  their traditions as old whaling captains, shook their heads ominously at  the dull spectre, and declared it was doubtful if the rain would cease  for three weeks yet.    The site of the caravan camp on the hither side of the Ungerengeri was a  hot-bed of malaria, unpleasant to witness--an abomination to memory.  The filth of generations of pagazis had gathered innumerable hosts  of creeping things. Armies of black, white, and red ants infest the  stricken soil; centipedes, like worms, of every hue, clamber over shrubs  and plants; hanging to the undergrowth are the honey-combed nests  of yellow-headed wasps with stings as harmful as scorpions; enormous  beetles, as large as full-grown mice, roll dunghills over the ground; of  all sorts, shapes, sizes, and hues are the myriad-fold vermin with which  the ground teems; in short, the richest entomological collection could  not vie in variety and numbers with the species which the four walls of  my tent enclosed from morning until night.    On the fifth morning, or the 23rd April, the rain gave us a few hours'  respite, during which we managed to wade through the Stygian quagmire  reeking with noisomeness to the inundated river-bank. The soldiers  commenced at 5 A.M. to convey the baggage across from bank to bank over  a bridge which was the most rustic of the rustic kind. Only an ignorant  African would have been satisfied with its small utility as a means to  cross a deep and rapid body of water. Even for light-footed Wanyamwezi  pagazis it was anything but comfortable to traverse. Only a professional  tight-rope performer could have carried a load across with ease. To  travel over an African bridge requires, first, a long leap from land to  the limb of a tree (which may or may not be covered by water), followed  by a long jump ashore. With 70 lbs. weight on his back, the carrier  finds it difficult enough. Sometimes he is assisted by ropes  extemporized from the long convolvuli which hang from almost every tree,  but not always, these being deemed superfluities by the Washensi.    Fortunately the baggage was transferred without a single accident, and  though the torrent was strong, the donkeys were dragged through the  flood by vigorous efforts and much objurgation without a casualty.  This performance of crossing the Ungerengeri occupied fully five hours,  though energy, abuse, and fury enough were expended for an army.    Reloading and wringing our clothes dry, we set out from the horrible  neighbourhood of the river, with its reek and filth, in a northerly  direction, following a road which led up to easy and level ground. Two  obtruding hills were thus avoided on our left, and after passing them we  had shut out the view of the hateful valley.    I always found myself more comfortable and lighthearted while travelling  than when chafing and fretting in camp at delays which no effort could  avoid, and consequently I fear that some things, while on a march, may  be tinted somewhat stronger than their appearance or merit may properly  warrant. But I thought that the view opening before us was much more  agreeable than the valley of Simbamwenni with all its indescribable  fertility. It was a series of glades opening one after another between  forest clumps of young trees, hemmed in distantly by isolated peaks  and scattered mountains. Now and again, as we crested low eminences  we caught sight of the blue Usagara mountains, bounding the horizon  westerly and northerly, and looked down upon a vast expanse of plain  which lay between.    At the foot of the lengthy slope, well-watered by bubbling springs and  mountain rills, we found a comfortable khambi with well-made huts, which  the natives call Simbo. It lies just two hours or five miles north-west  of the Ungerengeri crossing. The ground is rocky, composed principally  of quartzose detritus swept down by the constant streams. In the  neighbourhood of these grow bamboo, the thickest of which was about two  and a half inches in diameter; the \"myombo,\" a very shapely tree, with  a clean trunk like an ash, the \"imbite,\" with large, fleshy leaves like  the \"mtamba,\" sycamore, plum-tree, the \"ugaza,\" ortamarisk, and the  \"mgungu,\" a tree containing several wide branches with small leaves  clustered together in a clump, and the silk-cotton tree.    Though there are no villages or settlements in view of Simbo Khambi,  there are several clustered within the mountain folds, inhabited by  Waseguhha somewhat prone to dishonest acts and murder.    The long broad plain visible from the eminences crossed between the  Ungerengeri and Simbo was now before us, and became known to sorrowful  memory subsequently, as the Makata Valley. The initial march was from  Simbo, its terminus at Rehenneko, at the base of the Usagara mountains,  six marches distant. The valley commences with broad undulations,  covered with young forests of bamboo, which grow thickly along the  streams, the dwarf fan-palm, the stately Palmyra, and the mgungu. These  undulations soon become broken by gullies containing water, nourishing  dense crops of cane reeds and broad-bladed grass, and, emerging from  this district, wide savannah covered with tall grass open into view,  with an isolated tree here and there agreeably breaking the monotony of  the scene. The Makata is a wilderness containing but one village of the  Waseguhha throughout its broad expanse. Venison, consequently, abounds  within the forest clumps, and the kudu, hartebeest, antelope, and zebra  may be seen at early dawn emerging into the open savannahs to feed. At  night, the cyn-hyaena prowls about with its hideous clamour seeking for  sleeping prey, man or beast.    The slushy mire of the savannahs rendered marching a work of great  difficulty; its tenacious hold of the feet told terribly on men  and animals. A ten-mile march required ten hours, we were therefore  compelled to camp in the middle of this wilderness, and construct a new  khambi, a measure which was afterwards adopted by half a dozen caravans.    The cart did not arrive until nearly midnight, and with it, besides  three or four broken-down pagazis, came Bombay with the dolorous tale,  that having put his load--consisting of the property tent, one large  American axe, his two uniform coats, his shirts, beads and cloth,  powder, pistol, and hatchet--on the ground, to go and assist the cart  out of a quagmire, he had returned to the place where he had left it  and could not find it, that he believed that some thieving Washensi, who  always lurk in the rear of caravans to pick up stragglers, had decamped  with it. Which dismal tale told me at black midnight was not received  at all graciously, but rather with most wrathful words, all of which  the penitent captain received as his proper due. Working myself into a  fury, I enumerated his sins to him; he had lost a goat at Muhalleh, he  had permitted Khamisi to desert with valuable property at Imbiki; he had  frequently shown culpable negligence in not looking after the donkeys,  permitting them to be tied up at night without seeing that they had  water, and in the mornings, when about to march, he preferred to sleep  until 7 o'clock, rather than wake up early and saddle the donkeys, that  we might start at 6 o'clock; he had shown of late great love for the  fire, cowering like a bloodless man before it, torpid and apathetic; he  had now lost the property-tent in the middle of the Masika season, by  which carelessness the cloth bales would rot and become valueless; he  had lost the axe which I should want at Ujiji to construct my boat; and  finally, he had lost a pistol and hatchet, and a flaskful of the best  powder. Considering all these things, how utterly incompetent he was  to be captain, I would degrade him from his office and appoint Mabruki  Burton instead. Uledi, also, following the example of Bombay, instead of  being second captain, should give no orders to any soldiers in future,  but should himself obey those given by Mabruki--the said Mabruki being  worth a dozen Bombays, and two dozen Uledis; and so he was dismissed  with orders to return at daylight to find the tent, axe, pistol, powder,  and hatchet.    The next morning the caravan, thoroughly fatigued with the last day's  exertions, was obliged to halt. Bombay was despatched after the  lost goods; Kingaru, Mabruki the Great, and Mabruki the Little were  despatched to bring back three doti-worth of grain, on which we were to  subsist in the wilderness.    Three days passed away and we were still at camp, awaiting, with what  patience we possessed, the return of the soldiers. In the meantime  provisions ran very low, no game could be procured, the birds were so  wild. Two days shooting procured but two potfuls of birds, consisting  of grouse, quail, and pigeons. Bombay returned unsuccessfully from his  search after the missing property, and suffered deep disgrace.    On the fourth day I despatched Shaw with two more soldiers, to see what  had become of Kingaru and the two Mabrukis. Towards night he returned  completely prostrated, with a violent attack of the mukunguru, or ague;  but bringing the missing soldiers, who were thus left to report for  themselves.

She hasn't done anything,\" replied  the Captain.    \"What do you want me to do?\" asked Dorothy.    This question seemed to puzzle them all.  Finally, a chafingdish,  exclaimed irritably:    \"If no one can throw any light on this subject you must excuse me if I  go out.\"    At this, a big kitchen fork pricked up its ears and said in a tiny  voice:    \"Let's hear from Judge Sifter.\"    \"That's proper,\" returned the King.    So Judge Sifter turned around slowly several times and then said:    \"We have nothing against the girl except the stove-hearth upon which  she sits.  Therefore I order her instantly discharged.\"    \"Discharged!\" cried Dorothy.  \"Why, I never was discharged in my life,  and I don't intend to be.  If it's all the same to you, I'll resign.\"    \"It's all the same,\" declared the King.  \"You are free--you and your  companions--and may go wherever you like.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the little girl.  \"But haven't you anything to eat in  your kingdom?  I'm hungry.\"    \"Go into the woods and pick blackberries,\" advised the King, lying down  upon his back again and preparing to go to sleep.  \"There isn't a  morsel to eat in all Utensia, that I know of.\"    So Dorothy jumped up and said:    \"Come on, Toto and Billina.  If we can't find the camp, we may find  some blackberries.\"    The utensils drew back and allowed them to pass without protest,  although Captain Dipp marched the Spoon Brigade in close order after  them until they had reached the edge of the clearing.    There the spoons halted; but Dorothy and her companions entered the  forest again and began searching diligently for a way back to the camp,  that they might rejoin their party.        17.  How They Came to Bunbury    Wandering through the woods, without knowing where you are going or  what adventure you are about to meet next, is not as pleasant as one  might think.  The woods are always beautiful and impressive, and if you  are not worried or hungry you may enjoy them immensely; but Dorothy was  worried and hungry that morning, so she paid little attention to the  beauties of the forest, and hurried along as fast as she could go.  She  tried to keep in one direction and not circle around, but she was not  at all sure that the direction she had chosen would lead her to the  camp.    By and by, to her great joy, she came upon a path.  It ran to the right  and to the left, being lost in the trees in both directions, and just  before her, upon a big oak, were fastened two signs, with arms pointing  both ways.  One sign read:      TAKE THE OTHER ROAD TO BUNBURY      and the second sign read:      TAKE THE OTHER ROAD TO BUNNYBURY      \"Well!\" exclaimed Billina, eyeing the signs, \"this looks as if we were  getting back to civilization again.\"    \"I'm not sure about the civil'zation, dear,\" replied the little girl;  \"but it looks as if we might get SOMEWHERE, and that's a big relief,  anyhow.\"    \"Which path shall we take?\" inquired the Yellow Hen.    Dorothy stared at the signs thoughtfully.    \"Bunbury sounds like something to eat,\" she said.  \"Let's go there.\"    \"It's all the same to me,\" replied Billina.  She had picked up enough  bugs and insects from the moss as she went along to satisfy her own  hunger, but the hen knew Dorothy could not eat bugs; nor could Toto.    The path to Bunbury seemed little traveled, but it was distinct enough  and ran through the trees in a zigzag course until it finally led them  to an open space filled with the queerest houses Dorothy had ever seen.  They were all made of crackers laid out in tiny squares, and were of  many pretty and ornamental shapes, having balconies and porches with  posts of bread-sticks and roofs shingled with wafer-crackers.    There were walks of bread-crusts leading from house to house and  forming streets, and the place seemed to have many inhabitants.    When Dorothy, followed by Billina and Toto, entered the place, they  found people walking the streets or assembled in groups talking  together, or sitting upon the porches and balconies.    And what funny people they were!    Men, women and children were all made of buns and bread.  Some were  thin and others fat; some were white, some light brown and some very  dark of complexion.  A few of the buns, which seemed to form the more  important class of the people, were neatly frosted.  Some had raisins  for eyes and currant buttons on their clothes; others had eyes of  cloves and legs of stick cinnamon, and many wore hats and bonnets  frosted pink and green.    There was something of a commotion in Bunbury when the strangers  suddenly appeared among them.  Women caught up their children and  hurried into their houses, shutting the cracker doors carefully behind  them.  Some men ran so hastily that they tumbled over one another,  while others, more brave, assembled in a group and faced the intruders  defiantly.    Dorothy at once realized that she must act with caution in order not to  frighten these shy people, who were evidently unused to the presence of  strangers.  There was a delightful fragrant odor of fresh bread in the  town, and this made the little girl more hungry than ever.  She told  Toto and Billina to stay back while she slowly advanced toward the  group that stood silently awaiting her.    \"You must 'scuse me for coming unexpected,\" she said, softly, \"but I  really didn't know I was coming here until I arrived.  I was lost in  the woods, you know, and I'm as hungry as anything.\"    \"Hungry!\" they murmured, in a horrified chorus.    \"Yes; I haven't had anything to eat since last night's supper,\" she  exclaimed.  \"Are there any eatables in Bunbury?\"    They looked at one another undecidedly, and then one portly bun man,  who seemed a person of consequence, stepped forward and said:    \"Little girl, to be frank with you, we are all eatables.  Everything in  Bunbury is eatable to ravenous human creatures like you.  But it is to  escape being eaten and destroyed that we have secluded ourselves in  this out-of-the-way place, and there is neither right nor justice in  your coming here to feed upon us.\"    Dorothy looked at him longingly.    \"You're bread, aren't you?\" she asked.    \"Yes; bread and butter.  The butter is inside me, so it won't melt and  run.  I do the running myself.\"    At this joke all the others burst into a chorus of laughter, and  Dorothy thought they couldn't be much afraid if they could laugh like  that.    \"Couldn't I eat something besides people?\" she asked.  \"Couldn't I eat  just one house, or a side-walk or something?  I wouldn't mind much what  it was, you know.\"    \"This is not a public bakery, child,\" replied the man, sternly.  \"It's  private property.\"    \"I know Mr.--Mr.--\"    \"My name is C. Bunn, Esquire,\" said the man.  \"'C' stands for Cinnamon,  and this place is called after my family, which is the most  aristocratic in the town.\"    \"Oh, I don't know about that,\" objected another of the queer people.  \"The Grahams and the Browns and Whites are all excellent families, and  there is none better of their kind.  I'm a Boston Brown, myself.\"    \"I admit you are all desirable citizens,\" said Mr. Bunn rather stiffly;  \"but the fact remains that our town is called Bunbury.\"    \"'Scuse me,\" interrupted Dorothy; \"but I'm getting hungrier every  minute.  Now, if you're polite and kind, as I'm sure you ought to be,  you'll let me eat SOMETHING.  There's so much to eat here that you will  never miss it.\"    Then a big, puffed-up man, of a delicate brown color, stepped forward  and said:    \"I think it would be a shame to send this child away hungry, especially  as she agrees to eat whatever we can spare and not touch our people.\"    \"So do I, Pop,\" replied a Roll who stood near.    \"What, then, do you suggest, Mr. Over?\" inquired Mr. Bunn.    \"Why, I'll let her eat my back fence, if she wants to.  It's made of  waffles, and they're very crisp and nice.\"    \"She may also eat my wheelbarrow,\" added a pleasant looking Muffin.  \"It's made of nabiscos with a zuzu wheel.\"    \"Very good; very good,\" remarked Mr. Bunn.  \"That is certainly very  kind of you.  Go with Pop Over and Mr. Muffin, little girl, and they  will feed you.\"    \"Thank you very much,\" said Dorothy, gratefully.  \"May I bring my dog  Toto, and the Yellow Hen?  They're hungry, too.\"    \"Will you make them behave?\" asked the Muffin.    \"Of course,\" promised Dorothy.    \"Then come along,\" said Pop Over.    So Dorothy and Billina and Toto walked up the street and the people  seemed no longer to be at all afraid of them.  Mr. Muffin's house came  first, and as his wheelbarrow stood in the front yard the little girl  ate that first.  It didn't seem very fresh, but she was so hungry that  she was not particular.  Toto ate some, too, while Billina picked up  the crumbs.    While the strangers were engaged in eating, many of the people came and  stood in the street curiously watching them.  Dorothy noticed six  roguish looking brown children standing all in a row, and she asked:    \"Who are you, little ones?\"    \"We're the Graham Gems,\" replied one; \"and we're all twins.\"    \"I wonder if your mother could spare one or two of you?\" asked Billina,  who decided that they were fresh baked; but at this dangerous question  the six little gems ran away as fast as they could go.    \"You musn't say such things, Billina,\" said Dorothy, reprovingly.  \"Now  let's go into Pop Over's back yard and get the waffles.\"    \"I sort of hate to let that fence go,\" remarked Mr. Over, nervously, as  they walked toward his house.  \"The neighbors back of us are Soda  Biscuits, and I don't care to mix with them.\"    \"But I'm hungry yet,\" declared the girl.  \"That wheelbarrow wasn't very  big.\"    \"I've got a shortcake "]]]
