[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#19)"],[1,"    A receipt to regain the lost affections of a wife, which hath never  been known to fail in the most desperate cases.      The captain was made large amends for the unpleasant minutes which he  passed in the conversation of his wife (and which were as few as he  could contrive to make them), by the pleasant meditations he enjoyed  when alone.    These meditations were entirely employed on Mr Allworthy's fortune;  for, first, he exercised much thought in calculating, as well as he  could, the exact value of the whole: which calculations he often saw  occasion to alter in his own favour: and, secondly and chiefly, he  pleased himself with intended alterations in the house and gardens,  and in projecting many other schemes, as well for the improvement of  the estate as of the grandeur of the place: for this purpose he  applied himself to the studies of architecture and gardening, and read  over many books on both these subjects; for these sciences, indeed,  employed his whole time, and formed his only amusement. He at last  completed a most excellent plan: and very sorry we are, that it is not  in our power to present it to our reader, since even the luxury of the  present age, I believe, would hardly match it. It had, indeed, in a  superlative degree, the two principal ingredients which serve to  recommend all great and noble designs of this nature; for it required  an immoderate expense to execute, and a vast length of time to bring  it to any sort of perfection. The former of these, the immense wealth  of which the captain supposed Mr Allworthy possessed, and which he  thought himself sure of inheriting, promised very effectually to  supply; and the latter, the soundness of his own constitution, and his  time of life, which was only what is called middle-age, removed all  apprehension of his not living to accomplish.    Nothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate  execution of this plan, but the death of Mr Allworthy; in calculating  which he had employed much of his own algebra, besides purchasing  every book extant that treats of the value of lives, reversions, &c.  From all which he satisfied himself, that as he had every day a chance  of this happening, so had he more than an even chance of its happening  within a few years.    But while the captain was one day busied in deep contemplations of  this kind, one of the most unlucky as well as unseasonable accidents  happened to him. The utmost malice of Fortune could, indeed, have  contrived nothing so cruel, so mal-a-propos, so absolutely destructive  to all his schemes. In short, not to keep the reader in long suspense,  just at the very instant when his heart was exulting in meditations on  the happiness which would accrue to him by Mr Allworthy's death, he  himself--died of an apoplexy.    This unfortunately befel the captain as he was taking his evening walk  by himself, so that nobody was present to lend him any assistance, if  indeed, any assistance could have preserved him. He took, therefore,  measure of that proportion of soil which was now become adequate to  all his future purposes, and he lay dead on the ground, a great  (though not a living) example of the truth of that observation of  Horace:            _Tu secanda marmora          Locas sub ipsum funus; et sepulchri          Immemor, struis domos._    Which sentiment I shall thus give to the English reader: \"You provide  the noblest materials for building, when a pickaxe and a spade are  only necessary: and build houses of five hundred by a hundred feet,  forgetting that of six by two.\"        Chapter ix.    A proof of the infallibility of the foregoing receipt, in the  lamentations of the widow; with other suitable decorations of death,  such as physicians, &c., and an epitaph in the true stile.      Mr Allworthy, his sister, and another lady, were assembled at the  accustomed hour in the supper-room, where, having waited a  considerable time longer than usual, Mr Allworthy first declared he  began to grow uneasy at the captain's stay (for he was always most  punctual at his meals); and gave orders that the bell should be rung  without the doors, and especially towards those walks which the  captain was wont to use.    All these summons proving ineffectual (for the captain had, by  perverse accident, betaken himself to a new walk that evening), Mrs  Blifil declared she was seriously frightened. Upon which the other  lady, who was one of her most intimate acquaintance, and who well knew  the true state of her affections, endeavoured all she could to pacify  her, telling her--To be sure she could not help being uneasy; but that  she should hope the best. That, perhaps the sweetness of the evening  had inticed the captain to go farther than his usual walk: or he might  be detained at some neighbour's. Mrs Blifil answered, No; she was sure  some accident had befallen him; for that he would never stay out  without sending her word, as he must know how uneasy it would make  her. The other lady, having no other arguments to use, betook herself  to the entreaties usual on such occasions, and begged her not to  frighten herself, for it might be of very ill consequence to her own  health; and, filling out a very large glass of wine, advised, and at  last prevailed with her to drink it.    Mr Allworthy now returned into the parlour; for he had been himself in  search after the captain. His countenance sufficiently showed the  consternation he was under, which, indeed, had a good deal deprived  him of speech; but as grief operates variously on different minds, so  the same apprehension which depressed his voice, elevated that of Mrs  Blifil. She now began to bewail herself in very bitter terms, and  floods of tears accompanied her lamentations; which the lady, her  companion, declared she could not blame, but at the same time  dissuaded her from indulging; attempting to moderate the grief of her  friend by philosophical observations on the many disappointments to  which human life is daily subject, which, she said, was a sufficient  consideration to fortify our minds against any accidents, how sudden  or terrible soever. She said her brother's example ought to teach her  patience, who, though indeed he could not be supposed as much  concerned as herself, yet was, doubtless, very uneasy, though his  resignation to the Divine will had restrained his grief within due  bounds.    \"Mention not my brother,\" said Mrs Blifil; \"I alone am the object of  your pity. What are the terrors of friendship to what a wife feels on  these occasions? Oh, he is lost! Somebody hath murdered him--I shall  never see him more!\"--Here a torrent of tears had the same consequence  with what the suppression had occasioned to Mr Allworthy, and she  remained silent.    At this interval a servant came running in, out of breath, and cried  out, The captain was found; and, before he could proceed farther, he  was followed by two more, bearing the dead body between them.    Here the curious reader may observe another diversity in the  operations of grief: for as Mr Allworthy had been before silent, from  the same cause which had made his sister vociferous; so did the  present sight, which drew tears from the gentleman, put an entire stop  to those of the lady; who first gave a violent scream, and presently  after fell into a fit.    The room was soon full of servants, some of whom, with the lady  visitant, were employed in care of the wife; and others, with Mr  Allworthy, assisted in carrying off the captain to a warm bed; where  every method was tried, in order to restore him to life.    And glad should we be, could we inform the reader that both these  bodies had been attended with equal success; for those who undertook  the care of the lady succeeded so well, that, after the fit had  continued a decent time, she again revived, to their great  satisfaction: but as to the captain, all experiments of bleeding,  chafing, dropping, &c., proved ineffectual. Death, that inexorable  judge, had passed sentence on him, and refused to grant him a  reprieve, though two doctors who arrived, and were fee'd at one and  the same instant, were his counsel.    These two doctors, whom, to avoid any malicious applications, we shall  distinguish by the names of Dr Y. and Dr Z., having felt his pulse; to  wit, Dr Y. his right arm, and Dr Z. his left; both agreed that he was  absolutely dead; but as to the distemper, or cause of his death, they  differed; Dr Y. holding that he died of an apoplexy, and Dr Z. of an  epilepsy.    Hence arose a dispute between the learned men, in which each delivered  the reasons of their several opinions. These were of such equal force,  that they served both to confirm either doctor in his own sentiments,  and made not the least impression on his adversary.    To say the truth, every physician almost hath his favourite disease,  to which he ascribes all the victories obtained over human nature. The  gout, the rheumatism, the stone, the gravel, and the consumption, have  all their several patrons in the faculty; and none more than the  nervous fever, or the fever on the spirits. And here we may account  for those disagreements in opinion, concerning the cause of a  patient's death, which sometimes occur, between the most learned of  the college; and which have greatly surprized that part of the world  who have been ignorant of the fact we have above asserted.    The reader may perhaps be surprized, that, instead of endeavouring to  revive the patient, the learned gentlemen should fall immediately into  a dispute on the occasion of his death; but in reality all such  experiments had been made before their arrival: for the captain was  put into a warm bed, had his veins scarified, his forehead chafed, and  all sorts of strong drops applied to his lips and nostrils.    The physicians, therefore, finding themselves anticipated in  everything they ordered, were at a loss how to apply that portion of  time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#19)"],[1,"were customarily  prominent barons. They collected the royal taxes, executed royal  justice, and presided over and controlled the hundred and county  courts. They were responsible for remitting a certain sum  annually. If a sheriff received more than necessary, he retained  the difference as his lawful profit of office. If he received less  than necessary, he had to make up the difference from his own  pocket. Before rendering theis account, he paid the royal  benefactions to religious houses, provided for the maintenance of  stock on crown lands, paid for the costs of provisions supplied to  the court, and paid for travelling expenses of the king and his  visitors. The payments were initially paid in kind: e.g. grain,  cattle, horses, hounds, and hawks. Sheriffs also took part in the  keeping of castles and often managed the estates of the King. Most  royal writs were addressed to the sheriff and county courts. They  also led the county militia in time of war or rebellion. At times,  a sheriff usurped royal rights, used royal estates for his own  purposes, encroached on private land and rights, extorted money,  and collected revenues only for his own pockets. Over the  centuries, there was much competition for the authority to select  the king, e.g. by the king, the county court, the barons, and the  Exchequer. There was also much pressure to limit his term to one  year. Also, the powers of the sheriffs slowly declined.    Royal income came from customary dues, profits of coinage and of  justice, and revenues from the King's own estates. For war, there  was no change in the custom that a man with five hides of land was  required to furnish one heavy-armed horseman for forty days  service in a year. The fyrd was retained. A threat of a Viking  invasion caused the Conquerer to reinstate the danegeld tax at 6s.  per hide, which was three times its old rate. (The price of an ox  was still about 30d.) To impose this tax uniformly, he sent  commissioners to conduct surveys by sworn verdicts of appointed  groups of local men. A detailed survey of land holdings and the  productive worth of each was made in 1086. The English called it  the \"Doomsday Book\" because there was no appeal from it.    The survey revealed, for instance, that one estate had \"on the  home farm five plough teams: there are also 25 villeins and 6  cotters with 14 teams among them. There is a mill worth 2s. a year  and one fishery, a church and four acres of meadow, wood for 150  pigs and two stone quarries, each worth 2s. a year, and two nests  of hawks in the wood and 10 slaves.\" This estate was deemed to be  worth 480s. a year.    Laxton \"had 2 carucates of land [assessed] to the geld. [There is]  land for 6 ploughs. There Walter, a man of [the lord] Geoffrey  Alselin's has 1 plough and 22 villeins and 7 bordars [a bordar had  a cottage and a small amount land in return for supplying small  provisions to his lord] having 5 ploughs and 5 serfs and 1 female  serf and 40 acres of meadow. Wood [land] for pannage [foraging by  pigs] 1 league in length and half a league in breadth. In King  Edward's time it was worth 9 pounds; now [it is worth] 6 pounds.\"    Ilbert de Laci has now this land, where he has twelve ploughs in  the demesne; and forty-eight villani, and twelve bordars with  fifteen ploughs, and three churches and three priests, and three  mills of ten shillings. Wood pastures two miles long, and one  broad. The whole manor five miles long and two broad. Value in  King Edward's time sixteen pounds, the same now.    That manor of the town of Coventry which was individually held was  that of the Countess of Coventry, who was the wife of the earl of  Mercia. \"The Countess held in Coventry. There are 5 hides. The  arable land employs 20 ploughs. In the demesne lands there are 3  ploughs and 7 bondmen. There are 50 villeins and 12 bordars with  20 ploughs. The mill there pay[s] 3 shillings. The woodlands are 2  miles long and the same broad. In King Edward's time and  afterwards, it was worth 22 pounds [440 s.], now only 11 pounds by  weight. These lands of the Countess Godiva Nicholas holds to farm  of the King.\"    The survey shows a few manors and monasteries owned a salt-house  or salt-pit in the local saltworks, from which they were entitled  to obtain salt.    In total there were about 110,000 villani [former coerls regarded  as customary, irremovable cultivator tenants]; 82,000 bordarii;  7,000 cotarii and cotseti [held land by service of labor or rent  paid in produce], and 25,000 servi [landless laborers]. There are  no more theows.    In the nation, there was a total of about 25,000 servi [landless  laborers], over 82,000 borderii, nearly 7,000 coatarii and cotseti  [held land or houses by service of labor or rent paid in produce],  and nearly 110,000 villani. This survey resulted in the first  national tax system of about 6s. per hide of land.    The survey also provided the Conquerer with a summary of customs  of areas. For instance, in Oxfordshire, \"Anyone breaking the  King's peace given under his hand and seal to the extent of  committing homicide shall be at the King's mercy in respect of his  life and members. That is if he be captured. And if he cannot be  captured, he shall be considered as an outlaw, and anyone who  kills him shall have all his possessions. The king shall take the  possessions of any stranger who has elected to live in Oxford and  who dies in possession of a house in that town, and without any  kinfolk. The king shall be entitled to the body and the  possessions of any man who kills another within his own court or  house excepting always the dower of his wife, if he has a wife who  has received dower.    The courts of the king and barons became schools of chivalry  wherein seven year old noble boys became as pages or valets, wore  a dagger and waited upon the ladies of the household. At age  fourteen, they were advanced to squires and admitted into more  familiar association with the knights and ladies of the court.  They perfected their skills in dancing, riding, fencing, hawking,  hunting, jousting, and engaged in team sports in which the goal  was to put the other side to rout. They learned the knightly art  of war. Enemy fighters were to be taken and held for ransom rather  than killed. Those engaging in rebellion were to be pardoned and  restored to some or all of their lands and titles. Lords' sons  could be mutually exchanged with an enemy's as security for peace.  After achieving knighthood, a man usually selected a wife from the  court at which he grew up. Parents tried to send their daughters  to a household superior in social status not only to learn  manners, but to make a good marriage. A girl who did not marry was  often sent to a nunnery; a dowry was necessary before her  acceptance.    The following incidents of land tenure began (but were not firmly  established until the reign of Henry II). Each tenant, whether  baron or subtenant, was to pay an \"aid\" in money for ransom if his  lord was captured in war, for the knighthood of his lord's eldest  son, and for the marriage of his lord's eldest daughter. The aid  was theoretically voluntary. Land could be held by an heir only if  he could fight. The eldest son began to succeed to the whole of  the lands in all military tenures. Younger sons of great houses  became bishops. An heir of a tenant had to pay a heavy \"relief\" on  succession to his estate. The relief replaced the heriot. If there  was a delay in proving heirship or paying relief, the lord would  hold the land and receive its income in the meantime, often a  year. If an heir was still a minor or female, he or she passed  into his lord's wardship, in which the lord had guardianship of  the heir and possession of the estate, with all its profits. The  mother was not made a minor's guardian. No longer was the estate  protected by the minor's kin as his birthright. A female heir was  expected to marry a man acceptable to the lord. The estate of an  heiress and her land was generally sold to the highest bidder. If  there were no heirs, the land escheated to the lord. If a tenant  committed felony, his land escheated to his lord. The word  \"felony\" came from the Latin word meaning \"to deceive\" and  referred to the feudal crime of betraying or committing treachery  against one's lord.    Astrologers resided with the families of the barons. People went  to fortune tellers' shops. There was horse racing, steeple races,  and chess for recreation. Girls had dolls; boys had toy soldiers,  spinning tops, toy horses, ships, and wooden models.    The state of medicine is indicated by this medical advice brought  to the nation by William's son after treatment on the continent:    \"If thou would have health and vigor Shun cares and avoid anger.  Be temperate in eating And in the use of wine. After a heavy meal  Rise and take the air Sleep not with an overloaded stomach And  above all thou must Respond to Nature when she calls.\"    The Conquerer allowed Jewish traders to follow him from Normandy  and settle in separate sections of the main towns. Then engaged in  long-distance trade, money-changing, and money-lending. They  loaned money for interest for the building of castles and  cathedrals. Christians were not allowed by the church to engage in  this usury. The Jews could not become citizens nor could they have  standing in the local courts. Instead, a royal justiciar secured  justice for them. They could practice their own religion.    William the Conquerer was succeeded as king by his son William II  (Rufus), who transgressed many of the customs of the nation to get  more money for himself. He was killed by an arrow of a fellow  hunter while they and William's younger brother Henry were hunting  together in a crown forest. Henry then became king.                                      - The Law -    The Norman conquerors brought no written law, but affirmed the  laws of the nation. Two they"]]]
