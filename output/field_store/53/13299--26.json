In confederacies, which hold  but by one end, men have nothing to provide for, but for the  imperfections, which particularly doe interest and concerne that end  and respect. It is no great matter what religion my Physician or  Lawyer is of: this consideration hath nothing common with the  offices of that friendship they owe mee. So doe I in the familiar  acquaintances that those who serve me contract with me. I am nothing  inquisitive whether a Lackey be chaste or no, but whether he be  diligent: I feare not a gaming Muletier, so much as if he be weake:  nor a hot swearing Cooke, as one that is ignorant and unskilfull; I  never meddle with saying what a man should doe in the world; there  are over many others that doe it; but what my selfe doe in the  world.         Mihi sic usus est: Tibi, ut opus est facto, face       [Footnote: Ter. Heau. act. i. sc. i, 28.]         So is it requisite for me:       Doe thou as needfull is for thee.    Concerning familiar table-talke, I rather acquaint my selfe with and  follow a merry conceited [Footnote: Fanciful] humour, than a wise  man: And in bed I rather prefer beauty than goodnesse; and in  society or conversation of familiar discourse, I respect rather  sufficiency, though without Preud'hommie, [Footnote: Probity.] and  so of all things else. Even as he that was found riding upon an  hobby-horse, playing with his children besought him who thus  surprized him not to speake of it untill he were a father himselfe,  supposing the tender fondnesse and fatherly passion which then would  posesse his minde should make him an impartiall judge of such an  action; so would I wish to speake to such as had tried what I speake  of: but knowing how far such an amitie is from the common use, and  how seld scene and rarely found, I looke not to finde a competent  judge. For, even the discourses, which sterne antiquitie hath left  us concerning this subject, seeme to me but faint and forcelesse in  respect of the feeling I have of it; And in that point the effects  exceed the very precepts of Philosophie.         Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.       [Footnote: Hor. 1. i. Sat. vii. 44]         For me, be I well in my wit,       Nought, as a merry friend, so fit.    Ancient Menander accounted him happy that had but met the shadow of  a true friend: verily he had reason to say so, especially if he had  tasted of any: for truly, if I compare all the rest of my forepassed  life, which although I have, by the meere mercy of God, past at rest  and ease, and except the losse of so deare a friend, free from all  grievous affliction, with an ever-quietnesse of minde, as one that  have taken my naturall and originall commodities in good payment,  without searching any others: if, as I say, I compare it all unto  the foure yeares I so happily enjoied the sweet company and deare-  deare society of that worthy man, it is nought but a vapour, nought  but a darke and yrkesome light. Since the time I lost him,                 quem semper acerbum,       Semper honoratum (sic Dii voluistis) habebo,       [Footnote: Virg. AEn. iii. 49.]         Which I shall ever hold a bitter day,       Yet ever honour'd (so my God t' obey),    I doe but languish, I doe but sorrow: and even those pleasures, all  things present me with, in stead of yeelding me comfort, doe but  redouble the griefe of his losse. We were copartners in all things.  All things were with us at halfe; me thinkes I have stolne his part  from him.       --Nee fas esse iilla me voluptate hic frui       Decrevi, tantisper dum ille abest meus particeps.       [Footnote: Ter. Heau. act. i. sc. i, 97.]         I have set downe, no joy enjoy I may,       As long as he my partner is away.    I was so accustomed to be ever two, and so enured [Footnote:  Accustomed] to be never single, that me thinks I am but halfe my  selfe.         Illam mea si partem animce tulit,       Maturior vis, quid moror altera.       Nec charus aeque nec superstes,       Integer? Ille dies utramque       Duxit ruinam.       [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Od. xvii.]         Since that part of my soule riper fate reft me,       Why stay I heere the other part he left me?       Nor so deere, nor entire, while heere I rest:       That day hath in one mine both opprest.    There is no action can betide me, or imagination possesse me, but I  heare him saying, as indeed he would have done to me: for even as he  did excell me by an infinite distance in all other sufficiencies and  vertues, so did he in all offices and duties of friendship.         Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus,       Tam chari capitis?       [Footnote: Id. 1. i. Od. xxiv.]         What modesty or measure may I beare,       In want and wish of him that was so deare?         O misero frater adempte mihi!       Omnia tecum una perieruni gaudia nostra.       Qua tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor.       [Footnote: CATUL. Eleg. iv. 20, 92, 26, 95.]       Tu mea, tu moriens fregisti commoda frater.       [Footnote: Ib. 21.]       Tecum una tota est nostra sepulta anima,       Cujus ego interitu tota de mente fugavi       Hac studia, atque omnes delicias animi       [Footnote: CATUL. Bl. iv. 94.]       Alloquar? audiero nunquam tua verba loquentem?       [Footnote: Ib. 25.]       Nunquam ego te vita frater amabilior,       Aspiciam posthac? at certe semper amabo.       [Footnote: El. i. 9.]         O brother rest from miserable me,       All our delights are perished with thee,       Which thy sweet love did nourish in my breath.       Thou all my good hast spoiled in thy death:       With thee my soule is all and whole enshrinde,       At whose death I have cast out of my minde       All my mindes sweet-meats, studies of this kinde;       Never shall I, heare thee speake, speake with thee?       Thee brother, than life dearer, never see?       Yet shalt them ever be belov'd of mee.    But let us a little feare this yong man speake, being but sixteene  yeares of age.    Because I have found this worke to have since beene published (and  to an ill end) by such as seeke to trouble and subvert the state of  our common-wealth, nor caring whether they shall reforme it or no;  which they have fondly inserted among other writings of their  invention, I have revoked my intent, which was to place it here. And  lest the Authors memory should any way be interessed with those that  could not thoroughly know his opinions and actions, they shall  understand that this subject was by him treated of in his infancie,  only by way of exercise, as a subject, common, bareworne, and wyer-  drawne in a thousand bookes. I will never doubt but he beleeved what  he writ, and writ as he thought: for hee was so conscientious that  no lie did ever passe his lips, yea were it but in matters of sport  or play: and I know, that had it beene in his choyce, he would  rather have beene borne at Venice than at Sarlac; and good, reason  why: But he had another maxime deepely imprinted in his minde, which  was, carefully to obey, and religiously to submit himselfe to the  lawes, under which he was borne. There was never a better citizen,  nor more affected to the welfare and quietnesse of his countrie, nor  a sharper enemie of the changes, innovations, newfangles, and hurly-  burlies of his time: He would more willingly have imployed the  utmost of his endevours to extinguish and suppresse, than to favour  or further them: His minde was modelled to the patterne of other  best ages. But yet in exchange of his serious treatise, I will here  set you downe another, more pithie, materiall, and of more  consequence, by him likewise produced at that tender age.          OF BOOKS    I make no doubt but it shall often befall me to speake of things  which are better, and with more truth, handled by such as are their  crafts-masters. Here is simply an essay of my natural faculties, and  no whit of those I have acquired. And he that shall tax me with  ignorance shall have no great victory at my hands; for hardly could  I give others reasons for my discourses that give none unto my  selfe, and am not well satisfied with them. He that shall make  search after knowledge, let him seek it where it is there is nothing  I professe lesse. These are but my fantasies by which I endevour not  to make things known, but my selfe. They may haply one day be knowne  unto me, or have bin at other times, according as fortune hath  brought me where they were declared or manifested. But I remember  them no more. And if I be a man of some reading, yet I am a man of  no remembering, I conceive no certainty, except it bee to give  notice how farre the knowledge I have of it doth now reach. Let no  man busie himselfe about the matters, but on the fashion I give  them. Let that which I borrow be survaied, and then tell me whether  I have made good choice of ornaments to beautifie and set foorth the  invention which ever comes from mee. For I make others to relate  (not after mine owne fantasie but as it best falleth out) what I  cannot so well expresse, either through unskill of language or want  of judgement. I number not my borrowings, but I weigh them. And if I  would have made their number to prevail, I would have had twice as  many. They are all, or almost all, of so famous and ancient names,  that me thinks they sufficiently name themselves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#19)"],[1,"develop by  exercise the active capacities and social feelings of the individual  citizens. On neither of these points is it necessary that much should  be said at this stage of our inquiry.    The want of an amount power in the government adequate to preserve  order and allow of progress in the people is incident rather to a wild  and rude state of society generally than to any particular form of  political union. When the people are too much attached to savage  independence to be tolerant of the amount of power to which it is for  their good that they should be subject, the state of society (as  already observed) is not yet ripe for representative government. When  the time for that government has arrived, sufficient power for all  needful purposes is sure to reside in the sovereign assembly; and if  enough of it is not intrusted to the executive, this can only arise  from a jealous feeling on the part of the assembly toward the  administration, never likely to exist but where the constitutional  power of the assembly to turn them out of office has not yet  sufficiently established itself. Wherever that constitutional right is  admitted in principle and fully operative in practice, there is no  fear that the assembly will not be willing to trust its own ministers  with any amount of power really desirable; the danger is, on the  contrary, lest they should grant it too ungrudgingly, and too  indefinite in extent, since the power of the minister is the power of  the body who make and who keep him so. It is, however, very likely,  and is one of the dangers of a controlling assembly, that it may be  lavish of powers, but afterwards interfere with their exercise; may  give power by wholesale, and take it back in detail, by multiplied  single acts of interference in the business of administration. The  evils arising from this assumption of the actual function of  governing, in lieu of that of criticising and checking those who  govern, have been sufficiently dwelt upon in the preceding chapter. No  safeguard can in the nature of things be provided against this  improper meddling, except a strong and general conviction of its  injurious character.    The other negative defect which may reside in a government, that of  not bringing into sufficient exercise the individual faculties, moral,  intellectual, and active, of the people, has been exhibited generally  in setting forth the distinctive mischiefs of despotism. As between  one form of popular government and another, the advantage in this  respect lies with that which most widely diffuses the exercise of  public functions; on the one hand, by excluding fewest from the  suffrage; on the other, by opening to all classes of private citizens,  so far as is consistent with other equally important objects, the  widest participation in the details of judicial and administrative  business; as by jury-trial, admission to municipal offices, and, above  all, by the utmost possible publicity and liberty of discussion,  whereby not merely a few individuals in succession, but the whole  public, are made, to a certain extent, participants in the government,  and sharers in the instruction and mental exercise derived from it.  The further illustration of these benefits, as well as of the  limitations under which they must be aimed at, will be better deferred  until we come to speak of the details of administration.    The _positive_ evils and dangers of the representative, as of every  other form of government, may be reduced to two heads: first, general  ignorance and incapacity, or, to speak more moderately, insufficient  mental qualifications, in the controlling body; secondly, the danger  of its being under the influence of interests not identical with the  general welfare of the community.    The former of these evils, deficiency in high mental qualifications,  is one to which it is generally supposed that popular government is  liable in a greater degree than any other. The energy of a monarch,  the steadiness and prudence of an aristocracy, are thought to contrast  most favorably with the vacillation and shortsightedness of even the  most qualified democracy. These propositions, however, are not by any  means so well founded as they at first sight appear.    Compared with simple monarchy, representative government is in these  respects at no disadvantage. Except in a rude age, hereditary  monarchy, when it is really such, and not aristocracy in disguise, far  surpasses democracy in all the forms of incapacity supposed to be  characteristic of the last. I say, except in a rude age, because in a  really rude state of society there is a considerable guaranty for the  intellectual and active capacities of the sovereign. His personal will  is constantly encountering obstacles from the willfulness of his  subjects, and of powerful individuals among their number. The  circumstances of society do not afford him much temptation to mere  luxurious self-indulgence; mental and bodily activity, especially  political and military, are his principal excitements; and among  turbulent chiefs and lawless followers he has little authority, and is  seldom long secure even of his throne, unless he possesses a  considerable amount of personal daring, dexterity, and energy. The  reason why the average of talent is so high among the Henries and  Edwards of our history may be read in the tragical fate of the second  Edward and the second Richard, and the civil wars and disturbances of  the reigns of John and his incapable successor. The troubled period of  the Reformation also produced several eminent hereditary  monarchs--Elizabeth, Henri Quatre, Gustavus Adolphus; but they were  mostly bred up in adversity, succeeded to the throne by the unexpected  failure of nearer heirs, or had to contend with great difficulties in  the commencement of their reign. Since European life assumed a settled  aspect, any thing above mediocrity in an hereditary king has become  extremely rare, while the general average has been even below  mediocrity, both in talent and in vigor of character. A monarchy  constitutionally absolute now only maintains itself in existence  (except temporarily in the hands of some active-minded usurper)  through the mental qualifications of a permanent bureaucracy. The  Russian and Austrian governments, and even the French government in  its normal condition, are oligarchies of officials, of whom the head  of the state does little more than select the chiefs. I am speaking of  the regular course of their administration; for the will of the master  of course determines many of their particular acts.    The governments which have been remarkable in history for sustained  mental ability and vigor in the conduct of affairs have generally been  aristocracies. But they have been, without any exception,  aristocracies of public functionaries. The ruling bodies have been so  narrow, that each member, or at least each influential member of the  body, was able to make, and did make, public business an active  profession, and the principal occupation of his life. The only  aristocracies which have manifested high governing capacities, and  acted on steady maxims of policy through many generations, are those  of Rome and Venice. But, at Venice, though the privileged order was  numerous, the actual management of affairs was rigidly concentrated in  a small oligarchy within the oligarchy, whose whole lives were devoted  to the study and conduct of the affairs of the state. The Roman  government partook more of the character of an open aristocracy like  our own. But the really governing body, the Senate, was in exclusively  composed of persons who had exercised public functions, and had either  already filled, or were looking forward to fill the highest offices of  the state, at the peril of a severe responsibility in case of  incapacity and failure. When once members of the Senate, their lives  were pledged to the conduct of public affairs; they were not permitted  even to leave Italy except in the discharge of some public trust; and  unless turned out of the Senate by the censors for character or  conduct deemed disgraceful, they retained their powers and  responsibilities to the end of life. In an aristocracy thus  constituted, every member felt his personal importance entirely bound  up with the dignity and estimation of the commonwealth which he  administered, and with the part he was able to play in its councils.  This dignity and estimation were quite different things from the  prosperity or happiness of the general body of the citizens, and were  often wholly incompatible with it. But they were closely linked with  the external success and aggrandisement of the state; and it was,  consequently, in the pursuit of that object almost exclusively, that  either the Roman or the Venetian aristocracies manifested the  systematically wise collective policy and the great individual  capacities for government for which history has deservedly given them  credit.    It thus appears that the only governments, not representative, in  which high political skill and ability have been other than  exceptional, whether under monarchical or aristocratic forms, have  been essentially bureaucracies. The work of government has been in the  hands of governors by profession, which is the essence and meaning of  bureaucracy. Whether the work is done by them because they have been  trained to it, or they are trained to it because it is to be done by  them, makes a great difference in many respects, but none at all as to  the essential character of the rule. Aristocracies, on the other hand,  like that of England, in which the class who possessed the power  derived it merely from their social position, without being specially  trained or devoting themselves exclusively to it (and in which,  therefore, the power was not exercised directly, but through  representative institutions oligarchically constituted), have "]]]
