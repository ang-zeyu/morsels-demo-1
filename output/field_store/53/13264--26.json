It was a jolly party that, as Big Ben struck the hour of ten, boarded  the train bound for the seaport town where the Queen Bess lay at anchor.  Children with their sponsors filled every compartment of the train.    When they at last reached their destination and swarmed out on the  platform the children began singing:    \"Roll Out the Barrel.\" And no one said, \"Hush, this is Sunday.\" But  everyone took up the song. For this was the children's hour.    There was no singing as, after finding their compartment for them, the  little group from Ramsey Farm prepared to bid goodbye to Cherry, Tillie  and Peggy.    Every one of them knew that their little group was breaking up and  perhaps forever. They had shared joy and sorrow. A brother, two sisters,  a life-long friend, a new-found pal from across the sea and two little  waifs from the slums of London, they silently shook hands in the dark,  then whispered, \"Goodbye-Goodbye! Goodbye! And lots of good luck!\"    On the way back on the train Alice whispered to Dave, \"I wish Cherry  hadn't gone.\"    \"Why?\" Dave stared.    \"I don't know. I just wish it, that's all.\"    And so, through the blackout, the little English train carried them back  to London.    Next day Alice returned to her improvised buttery and her churn. But the  song that so often had enlivened her task as the dasher went up and down  was silenced.    For Dave the joy of flying increased with every morn. To climb up from  the earth, to greet the dawn, to lose himself in the clouds, ah! that  was joy beyond compare.    \"If it only weren't war,\" he whispered to himself. And yet war did give  it an added tang. It was like the nipping frost in the air that greets  the ice-skater or the singing of the sled runners that delights the ears  of the dog-team racer. He did look forward to the day when the young  Lord's penalty should be paid and the four of them would again be in the  air.    The day came and they thundered away with the break of day. On this day,  however, Heinie apparently was content to stay at home. Not a speck  marred the blue of that little patch of the sky over England they  claimed as their own.    \"We'll meet them again,\" the young Lord's tone was confident, as at last  they returned to earth.    \"Wolves, weasels, skunks, and all kinds of varmints visit the same  little corner of the earth time after time. So do the Jerries. That big  boaster, Wick, will return. And then!\" It was clear that he had not  forgotten the loss of his most beloved flying mate, Fiddlin' Johnny.    \"I wonder,\" Dave said thoughtfully. \"Does Wick always fly his men in  that V-shaped formation?\"    \"Always, I am told,\" was the answer.    \"He assumes that we want to get at him and that we'll go for the man  protecting his tail,\" Dave said thoughtfully. \"That gives his other men  a chance to close in and clean us up. Supposing we fooled him by taking  off his three men on the other line, one at a time?\"    \"It's an idea,\" the young Lord replied. \"Perhaps we'll try it. Yes, I  think we shall--when the time comes. And it will come, never fear!\"    \"Alice must be lonesome with Cherry and the children gone,\" Dave  suggested to Brand that evening. \"Let's go over.\"    \"I can't tonight,\" was Brand's reply. \"The Lark is giving me a lesson on  handling a Brownie. You can't learn too much, you know, not in this  man's war.\"    \"Nor half enough,\" Dave agreed.    Mounting Brand's bicycle, Dave rode over the pleasing country roads to  Ramsey Farm. Night was just falling. There was a glorious freshness  about the night air. The war seemed far away. \"As if it couldn't touch  any of us,\" he thought. How wrong he could be at times.    He found Alice doing the dinner dishes. Flash was curled up by the fire.  Old Jock was at the stables. Dave grabbed a drying towel and helped with  the dishes. Then they sat by the cheerful fire. He spoke of his day's  work. \"No luck,\" he concluded. \"Perhaps tomorrow. Brand and I are  getting better with our planes every day. We'll be fighters yet.\"    Alice smiled.    \"Tonight _they_ seemed very far away,\" she said, after a moment. Her  voice was low. \"It's the first time Cherry and I have been parted for  long.\"    He knew who she meant and was silent.    From outside came the sound of a car. It stopped. There was a hand on  the latch. Mrs. Ramsey stepped into the room. A large, healthy,  good-natured woman, on arriving it was her custom to shout a cheery  greeting. Tonight there was nothing of that.    \"You're here, David?\" she said as she took his hand. \"I'm glad.\" She  gave Dave her heavy coat, then took a place by the fire.    \"It's a bit chilly outside tonight,\" said Alice.    \"Quite.\" Mrs. Ramsey's voice seemed strange.    \"But still and peaceful,\" Dave suggested. \"As if there were no war.\"    After that for a full minute there was silence.    When at last the mother spoke her voice was high-pitched and a little  strained. \"I don't know how to say it,\" she began. \"I'm not good at such  things. I'm always too blunt about my speech. 'Out with it', that's been  my motto.    \"You must know how I feel,\" she went on after a pause, \"So why all the  beating around the bush? A rather terrible thing has happened. The Queen  Bess has been attacked and sunk.\"    Dave started and stared, yet neither he nor Alice spoke a word.    \"It came to me by secret message,\" Mrs. Ramsey went on. \"The general  public doesn't know about it yet.\"    \"And did--did--\" Alice's words stuck in her throat.    \"We have only the most meager details,\" the mother said. \"It was a sea  raider that did it, not a submarine. The raider came in firing a  broadside. Then it vanished into the night.    \"In twenty minutes the Queen Bess was gone, down by the bow. There was a  sea on. Some of the lifeboats were swamped. The children were  magnificent! Perfectly magnificent!\" Mrs. Ramsey swallowed hard. \"All of  them sang 'Roll out the Barrel' through it all.\"    \"Oh--o!\" Alice breathed, then hid her face.    \"That's all there is to tell.\" Mrs. Ramsey rose. \"I must get back. I  practically ran away. There was a frightful raid last night. All our  wards are full. We--we'll hope for the best.\" She was gone.    They sat there in silence by the fire for a long time, the boy and the  girl, in a troubled world.    At last Dave rose to walk slowly back and forth across the well-worn  floor.    It was Alice who at last spoke. \"Dave. She is not gone. She's out there  somewhere. You can't kill such a spirit as Cherry's. You just can't.\"    \"That's right,\" Dave agreed. \"It can't be done.\" He meant just that.  \"Well,\" he sighed, \"I'll be going back. Let me know about things.  I--I'll bring Brand tomorrow night if we can make it.\"    \"Dave, I'm sorry,\" Alice said as she clasped his hand in farewell. She  was thinking of him just then, he knew that. She was trying to tell him  she was sorry their happy evening together had been spoiled. How sort of  magnificent she was! How marvelous these English girls!                                      _Chapter_ XXIII                                  Victory      When Dave told Brand and the young Lord the news of the sinking, true to  their British tradition they had little to say. Next day, however, they  appeared on the field prepared for the dawn patrol. Dave saw new, hard  lines about their lips.    \"I'd hate to be their enemy today,\" he thought, as a thrill ran up his  spine.    They had been cruising, four of them, the young Lord, Brand, The Lark,  and Dave, for an hour when out of a very small cloud, for all the world  as if it had been waiting there for days, came that same formation, five  planes in a V-shape. One plane following the leader on the right and  three on the left.    \"Can I believe my eyes?\" The Lark shouted into his speaker.    \"You can.\" The young Lord's voice was low. \"Not another word. No  shouting, please. You all know how we planned it. I'll take the talk man  of the three on the left. You know the rest. Tallyho!\"    \"Tallyho,\" came echoing from the others. They were away.    Since they were a thousand feet above the enemy and in the end they came  swooping down from above. They were not seen until the young Lord was  all but upon his victim. His was a murderous assault that could have but  one ending. As if in rehearsal, The Lark slipped into the place left  vacant by the young Lord as he dropped into a power-dive. The Lark's man  went down in flames. Deserting his post, the third man tried flight, but  with the luck of a beginner, Brand shot downward, then climbed straight  up to riddle the Messerschmitt's motor and send it down in a cloud of  yellow smoke.    As for Dave, the whole affair had gone off with such speed that he found  himself in a half daze, headed straight for the side of a gleaming  Messerschmitt. Then his eyes registered an astonishing fact. He was  facing the boasting Wick himself, he who called himself a deadly killer.  On the tail of his plane was a black blotch. Dave knew this to be  fifty-six black lines, one for each victim Wick claimed. For a space of  seconds Dave's blood was turned to ice. Then, with a rush, it was like  molten steel.    They were close now, dangerously close, yet each was out of range of the  other. Suddenly gripping his emergency lever, giving his motor its last  ounce of power, Dave banked sharply, saw the terrible Wick rise into his  sight, pressed the firing button, heard for one brief second his  machine-guns speak, then went into a spin. Whirling over and over and  going down, down, down where the good soil of Merry England lies, he  thought, \"This is the end!\"    He was wrong. He came out of the spin. How? He would never know.    After levelling off he looked up, then down. To the right of him a  Messerschmitt was falling in flames. Even as he looked it exploded in  mid-air.    Far in the distance the one remaining enemy was speeding away. Off to  the left the young Lord's "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#19)"],[1,"they began work, and, on  being questioned, admitted that their surrender was due principally  to the fact that they had been unable to find food of any sort on the  island, and that after searching all over it no spring of water could be  discovered.    \"In that case,\" Sir John Boswell said, \"I have no doubt they have all  surrendered. I before thought it probable that a good many of them would  have remained hidden, trusting to be able to make a raft after we  had left, and so get away, believing rightly enough that we should be  disinclined to search every foot of the island for them. As it is, I  doubt not, all are here.\"    The little fleet anchored that night at the rendezvous, and after two  more days' rowing reached Rhodes, where the appearance of the three  galleys, followed by their five prizes, was greeted with great  acclamation. The news, however, that twenty-seven knights had fallen,  and that thirteen or fourteen others were very gravely wounded, damped  the satisfaction that every one had at first felt. D'Aubusson came  down as soon as they reached the mole, and was greatly affected when he  received Ricord's report.    \"It is an unfortunate loss indeed, Sir Louis,\" he said, \"though it may  be that the victory is not too dearly purchased. I do not speak of the  captured ships, nor of the spoil they contain, nor even of the slaves  you have brought us, welcome though all may be, but of the effect that  the defeat and capture of these craft of Hassan Ali's will have. It is  plain that the preparations the sultan is making, and the belief that  Rhodes is doomed, have so encouraged the infidels that they are becoming  really formidable at sea. This blow will show them that the Order has  yet power to sweep the sea of pirates. Since, however, this adventure  has taught us that a single leader like Hassan sails with at least nine  ships under his orders, it is clear that in future our galleys must not  adventure singly among the islands. It was fortunate indeed that first  Santoval, and then Piccolomini, arrived to your assistance. How was it  that they happened to come up so opportunely?\"    \"Sir John Boswell, with Ralph Harcourt and Gervaise Tresham; went in  a boat to the rendezvous we had arranged, and reached it after an  adventure, which I will leave Sir John to tell himself. I may say that  the two young knights named had in our encounter both obtained very high  credit amongst us all for the valour with which they fought. No one bore  himself more stoutly, and I am glad to take this early opportunity of  bringing their conduct before your notice. As you will learn from Sir  John, Gervaise Tresham afterwards showed a quickness of wit that was the  means of saving the lives of those with him, and I may say also of all  with me, for had they failed to reach the rendezvous we should have  fallen easy victims to the five ships Hassan Ali brought against us.\"    Sending for Sir John Boswell, the grand prior heard from him the details  of his adventure in the boat.    \"I am right glad to hear you speak so warmly of Tresham, Sir John, for I  regard him as my special protege, and am pleased indeed to find that at  this outset of his career he has proved himself not only a brave knight,  but full of resource, and quick at invention. I think, Sir John, that  these two young knights have shown themselves well worthy of receiving  the honour of secular knighthood.\"    \"Assuredly they have,\" Sir John agreed.    \"Then, Sir John, will you bestow it upon them? The Order, as an Order,  does not bestow the honour, but its members do not forfeit their right  as knights to bestow it individually, and none among us are more worthy  of admitting them to your rank than yourself.\"    \"I would gladly do it, Sir Peter; but the honour would come far better  from yourself, and would not only be more highly prized by them, but  would be of greater value in the eyes of others. I am but a simple  knight commander of the Order, and my name would scarce be known beyond  its ranks. But to be knighted by one whose name is known and honoured  throughout Europe would give them a standing wherever they went, and  place them on a level with the best.\"    \"If that is your opinion, Boswell, I will myself undertake it, and  will do it at once; it were better done here than at a conclave of the  Order--now, when they are fresh from the battle. Let the knights be  summoned from the other galleys at once.\"    In a few minutes the whole of the knights were assembled on the poop of  the galley.    \"Friends, and brother knights,\" D'Aubusson said. \"First, in the name  of the Order, I have to thank you all most heartily for the brave deeds  that you have performed, and for the fresh honour you have won for it.  Every man has, as I learn from the three commanders, borne himself as  a true and valiant knight, ready to give his life in the cause of the  Order and of humanity. Two names have been specially brought before me  by commander Ricord, and by the good knight Sir John Boswell; they are  those of two young companions who, though knights of our Order, have not  yet received secular knighthood, and this, in the opinion of these  two knights, they have right worthily won. Sir Ralph Harcourt and Sir  Gervaise Tresham, step forward.\"    The two young knights, colouring with pleasure at this unexpected  honour, removed their helmets, and stood with bowed heads before the  grand prior. D'Aubusson went on, turning to the knights around him, \"I  am about, comrades, to undertake the office of knighting them. Sir  Louis Ricord and Sir John Boswell stand as their sponsors. But before I  proceed I would ask you all whether you, too, approve, and hold that Sir  Ralph Harcourt and Sir Gervaise Tresham have proved themselves worthy of  the honour of secular knighthood at my hands?\"    There was a general reply in the affirmative, the answer of the  survivors of Ricord's crew being specially emphatic. The grand prior  drew his sword, and the two young knights knelt before him, their  sponsors standing beside them.    \"Sir Ralph Harcourt, you have now been four years a knight of this  Order, but hitherto you have had no opportunity of drawing sword against  the infidels. Now that the chance has come, you have proved yourself a  true and valiant brother of the Order, and well worthy of the secular  accolade. It is in that capacity that I now knight you. It is not the  grand prior of Auvergne, but Sir Peter D'Aubusson, of the grand cross of  St. Louis, who now bestows upon you the honour of secular knighthood.\"  He touched him lightly with the sword. He then turned to Gervaise.    \"You, Sir Gervaise Tresham, are young indeed to receive the honour of  secular knighthood; but valour is of no age, and in the opinion of  your commanders, and in that of your comrades, you have proved yourself  worthy of the honour. You have shown too, that, as Sir John Boswell has  related to me, you are not only brave in action, but able, in the moment  of danger, to plan and to execute. You were, he tells me, the means of  saving his life and that of your comrade, and, by thus enabling him to  bear to the place of rendezvous the news of Sir Louis's danger, were  also the means of saving the lives of Sir Louis and his companions,  and of bringing home in safety the prizes he had taken. With such a  beginning it is easy to foresee that you will win for yourself some day  a distinguished position in the ranks of the Order, and are most worthy  of the honour I now bestow upon you.\" And he touched him with his sword.    The two young knights rose to their feet, bowed deeply to D'Aubusson,  and then retired, with their sponsors. They were at once surrounded by  the knights, who shook them by the hand, and warmly congratulated  them upon the honour that had befallen them, receiving equally warm  congratulations on their arrival at the auberge of the langue.    The five prizes turned out, when their cargoes were landed, to be much  more valuable than the cursory examination made by the knights had  warranted them in expecting. They contained, indeed, an accumulation of  the most valuable contents of the prizes taken by the pirates for a long  time previously; and as these desperadoes preyed upon Turkish  commerce as well as Christian, the goods consisted largely of Eastern  manufactures of all kinds. Costly robes, delicate embroidery, superb  carpets, shawls, goldsmiths' work, and no small amount of jewels, were  among the spoil collected, and the bulk of the merchandise captured was,  two days later, despatched in galleys to Genoa and Marseilles, to be  sold for the benefit of the Order.    D'Aubusson without hesitation carried out Sir John Boswell's promise to  the slaves who had rowed his boat. They were not only set at liberty,  but were each presented with a sum of money, and were placed on board a  galley, and landed on the mainland.    The English knights were all proud of the honour that had been won by  their young countrymen, the only exception being Robert Rivers, who was  devoured with jealousy at their advancement. He did not openly display  his feelings, for the reports not only of Sir John Boswell, but of the  other two English knights, were so strong that he dared not express  his discontent. He himself had twice been engaged with pirates, but  had gained no particular credit, and indeed had, in the opinion of his  comrades, been somewhat slack in the fray. He was no favourite in the  auberge, though he spared no pains to ingratiate himself with the senior  knights, and had a short time before been very severely reprimanded by  the bailiff for striking one of the servants.    \"I have more than once had to reprove you for your manners to the  servants,\" the bailiff said. \"You will now be punished by the septaine;  you will fast for seven days, on Wednesday and Friday you will receive  bread and water only, and will be confined to the auberge for that  period.
