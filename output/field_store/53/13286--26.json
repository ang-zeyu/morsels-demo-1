Herr Raaff, in four arias  of somewhere about 450 bars, sang in a manner which gave rise to the  remark that his want of voice was the principal cause of his singing  so badly. When he begins an air, unless at the same moment it recurs to  your mind that this is Raaff, the old but once so renowned tenor, I defy  any one not to burst out laughing. It is a fact, that in my own case I  thought, if I did not know that this is the celebrated Raaff, I  should be bent double from laughing, but as it is--I only take out my  handkerchief to hide a smile. They tell me here that he never was a good  actor; that people went to hear, but not to see him. He has by no means  a pleasing exterior. In this opera he was to die, singing in a long,  long, slow air; and he died laughing! and towards the end of the aria  his voice failed him so entirely that it was impossible to stand it!  I was in the orchestra next Wendling the flute-player, and as he had  previously criticized the song, saying it was unnatural to sing so long  before dying, adding, \"I do think he will never die!\" I said in return,  \"Have a little patience; it will soon be all over with him, for I can  hear he is at the last gasp!\" \"And I too,\" said he, laughing. The second  singer, Madlle. Strasserin, sang very well, and is an admirable actress.    There is a national stage here, which is permanent like that at Munich;  German operettas are sometimes given, but the singers in them are  wretched. Yesterday I dined with the Baron and Baroness von Hagen,  Oberstjagermeister here. Three days ago I called on Herr Schmalz, a  banker, to whom Herr Herzog, or rather Nocker and Schidl, had given me  a letter. I expected to have found a very civil good sort of man. When  I gave him the letter, he read it through, made me a slight bow, and said  nothing. At last, after many apologies for not having sooner waited on  him, I told him that I had played before the Elector. \"Really!\" Altum  silentium. I said nothing, he said nothing. At last I began again: \"I  will no longer intrude on you. I have the honor to\"--Here he interrupted  me. \"If I can be of any service to you, I beg\"--\"Before I leave this I  must take the liberty to ask you\"--\"Not for money?\" \"Yes, if you will  be so good as to\"--\"Oh! that I can't do; there is nothing in the letter  about money. I cannot give you any money, but anything else\"--\"There  is nothing else in which you can serve me--nothing whatever. I have the  honor to take my leave.\" I wrote the whole history yesterday to Herr  Herzog in Augsburg. We must now wait here for the answer, so you may  still write to us at Mannheim. I kiss your hand, and am your young  brother and father, as in your last letter you say \"I am the old man and  son.\" To-day is the 16th when I finish this, or else you will not know  when it was sent off. \"Is the letter ready?\" \"Yes, mamma, here it is!\"        77.    Mannheim, Nov. 20, 1777.    The gala began again yesterday [in honor of the Elector's name-day].  I went to hear the mass, which was a spick-and-span new composition of  Vogler's. Two days ago I was present at the rehearsal in the afternoon,  but came away immediately after the Kyrie. I never in my life heard  anything like it; there is often false harmony, and he rambles into the  different keys as if he wished to drag you into them by the hair of  your head; but it neither repays the trouble, nor does it possess any  originality, but is only quite abrupt. I shall say nothing of the way in  which he carries out his ideas. I only say that no mass of Vogler's can  possibly please any composer (who deserves the name). For example, I  suddenly hear an idea which is NOT BAD. Well, instead of remaining NOT  BAD, no doubt it soon becomes good? Not at all! it becomes not only BAD,  but VERY BAD, and this in two or three different ways: namely, scarcely  has the thought arisen when something else interferes to destroy it; or  he does not finish it naturally, so that it may remain good; or it  is not introduced in the right place; or it is finally ruined by bad  instrumentation. Such is Vogler's music.    Cannabich composes far better than when we knew him in Paris, but what  both mamma and I remarked here at once in the symphonies is, that one  begins just like another, always slow and unisono. I must now, dear  papa, write you something about the Holy Cross in Augsburg, which I have  always forgotten to do. I met with a great many civilities there, and  the Prelate is the most good-natured man in the world--a kind, worthy  old simpleton, who may be carried off at any moment, for his breath  fails sadly. He recently--in fact, the very day we left--had an attack  of paralysis. He, and the Dean and Procurator, begged us when we came  back to Augsburg to drive straight to the Holy Cross. The Procurator  is as jolly as Father Leopold at Seeon. [FOOTNOTE: A cloister in Lower  Bavaria, that Wolfgang often visited with his father, as they had a dear  friend there, Father Johannes.] My cousin told me beforehand what kind  of man he was, so we soon became as well acquainted as if we had known  each other for twenty years. I lent him the mass in F, and the first of  the short masses in C, and the offertorium in counterpoint in D minor.  My fair cousin has undertaken to be custodian of these. I got back the  offertorium punctually, having desired that it should be returned first.  They all, and even the Prelate, plagued me to give them a litany, De  venerabili. I said I had not got it with me. I really was by no means  sure; so I searched, but did not find it. They gave me no peace,  evidently thinking that I only wished to evade their request; so I said,  \"I really have not the litany with me; it is at Salzburg. Write to my  father; it is his affair. If he chooses to give it to you, well and  good; if not, I have nothing to do with it.\" A letter from the Deacon  to you will therefore probably soon make its appearance. Do just as you  please, but if you do send him one, let it be the last in E flat;  they have voices enough for anything, and a great many people will  be assembled at that time; they even write for them to come from a  distance, for it is their greatest festival. Adieu!        78.    Mannheim, Nov. 22, 1777.    THE first piece of information that I have to give you is, that my  truthful letter to Herr Herzog in Augsburg, puncto Schmalzii, has had a  capital effect. He wrote me a very polite letter in return, expressing  his annoyance that I should have been received so uncourteously by detto  Schmalz [melted butter]; so he herewith sent me a sealed letter to detto  Herr Milk, with a bill of exchange for 150 florins on detto Herr Cheese.  You must know that, though I only saw Herr Herzog once, I could not  resist asking him to send me a draft on Herr Schmalz, or to Herrn  Butter, Milk, and Cheese, or whom he would--a ca! This joke has  succeeded; it is no good making a poor mouth!    We received this forenoon (the 21st) your letter of the 17th. I was not  at home, but at Cannabich's, where Wendling was rehearsing a concerto  for which I have written the orchestral accompaniments. To-day at six  o'clock the gala concert took place. I had the pleasure of hearing Herr  Franzl (who married a sister of Madame Cannabich's) play a concerto on  the violin; he pleased me very much. You know that I am no lover of mere  difficulties. He plays difficult music, but it does not appear to be so;  indeed, it seems as if one could easily do the same, and this is  real talent. He has a very fine round tone, not a note wanting, and  everything distinct and well accentuated. He has also a beautiful  staccato in bowing, both up and down, and I never heard such a double  shake as his. In short, though in my opinion no WIZARD, he is a very  solid violin-player.--I do wish I could conquer my confounded habit of  writing crooked.    I am sorry I was not at Salzburg when that unhappy occurrence took place  about Madame Adlgasserin, so that I might have comforted her; and that  I would have done--particularly being so handsome a woman. [Footnote:  Adlgasser was the organist of the cathedral. His wife was thought very  stupid. See the letter of August 26, 1781.] I know already all that  you write to me about Mannheim, but I never wish to say anything  prematurely; all in good time. Perhaps in my next letter I may tell you  of something VERY GOOD in your eyes, but only GOOD in mine; or something  you will think VERY BAD, but I TOLERABLE; possibly, too, something only  TOLERABLE for you, but VERY GOOD, PRECIOUS, and DELIGHTFUL for me! This  sounds rather oracular, does it not? It is ambiguous, but still may be  divined.    My regards to Herr Bullinger; every time that I get a letter from you,  usually containing a few lines from him, I feel ashamed, as it reminds  me that I have never once written to my best and truest friend, from  whom I have received so much kindness and civility. But I cannot try to  excuse myself. I only beg of him to do so for me as far as possible,  and to believe that, as soon as I have a little leisure, I will write to  him--as yet I have had none; for from the moment I know that it is even  possible or probable that I may leave a place, I have no longer a single  hour I can call my own, and though I have now a glimmer of hope, still  I shall not be at rest till I know how things are. One of the oracle's  sayings must come to pass. I think it will be the middle one or the  last--I care not which, for at all events it will be something settled.    I no doubt wrote to you that Holzbauer's grand opera is in German. If  not, I write it now. The title is \"Gunther von Schwarzburg,\" but not our  worshipful Herr Gunther, barber and councillor at Salzburg! \"Rosamunde\"  is to be given during the ensuing Carnival, the libretto being a recent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#19)"],[1,"so little of the matter that--well, it never  even occurred to me to mention it.\"    \"Then--though he did call--he never saw Ransford?\" asked the inspector.    \"I tell you Ransford was already gone out,\" answered Bryce. \"He saw no  one but myself. Where Mrs. Deramore made her mistake--I happen to know,  Mitchington, that she started this rumour--was in trying to make two  and two into five. She saw this man crossing the Close, as if from  Ransford's house and she at once imagined he'd seen and been talking  with Ransford.\"    \"Old fool!\" said Mitchington. \"Of course, that's how these tales get  about. However, there's more than that in the air.\"    The two listeners behind the curtains glanced at each other. Ransford's  glance showed that he was already chafing at the unpleasantness of his  position--but Mary's only betokened apprehension. And suddenly, as if  she feared that Ransford would throw the curtains aside and walk into  the front room, she laid a hand on his arm and motioned him to be  patient--and silent.    \"Oh?\" said Bryce. \"More in the air? About that business?\"    \"Just so,\" assented Mitchington. \"To start with, that man Varner, the  mason, has never ceased talking. They say he's always at it--to the  effect that the verdict of the jury at the inquest was all wrong, and  that his evidence was put clean aside. He persists that he did see--what  he swore he saw.\"    \"He'll persist in that to his dying day,\" said Bryce carelessly. \"If  that's all there is--\"    \"It isn't,\" interrupted the inspector. \"Not by a long chalk! But  Varner's is a direct affirmation--the other matter's a sort of ugly  hint. There's a man named Collishaw, a townsman, who's been employed  as a mason's labourer about the Cathedral of late. This Collishaw,  it seems, was at work somewhere up in the galleries, ambulatories,  or whatever they call those upper regions, on the very morning of the  affair. And the other night, being somewhat under the influence of  drink, and talking the matter over with his mates at a tavern, he let  out some dark hints that he could tell something if he liked. Of course,  he was pressed to tell them--and wouldn't. Then--so my informant tells  me--he was dared to tell, and became surlily silent. That, of course,  spread, and got to my ears. I've seen Collishaw.\"    \"Well?\" asked Bryce.    \"I believe the man does know something,\" answered Mitchington. \"That's  the impression I carried away, anyhow. But--he won't speak. I charged  him straight out with knowing something--but it was no good. I told him  of what I'd heard. All he would say was that whatever he might have said  when he'd got a glass of beer or so too much, he wasn't going to say  anything now neither for me nor for anybody!\"    \"Just so!\" remarked Bryce. \"But--he'll be getting a glass too much  again, some day, and then--then, perhaps he'll add to what he said  before. And--you'll be sure to hear of it.\"    \"I'm not certain of that,\" answered Mitchington. \"I made some inquiry  and I find that Collishaw is usually a very sober and retiring sort of  chap--he'd been lured on to drink when he let out what he did. Besides,  whether I'm right or wrong, I got the idea into my head that he'd  already been--squared!\"    \"Squared!\" exclaimed Bryce. \"Why, then, if that affair was really  murder, he'd be liable to being charged as an accessory after the fact!\"    \"I warned him of that,\" replied Mitchington. \"Yes, I warned him  solemnly.\"    \"With no effect?\" asked Bryce.    \"He's a surly sort of man,\" said Mitchington. \"The sort that takes  refuge in silence. He made no answer beyond a growl.\"    \"You really think he knows something?\" suggested Bryce. \"Well--if there  is anything, it'll come out--in time.\"    \"Oh, it'll come out!\" assented Mitchington. \"I'm by no means satisfied  with that verdict of the coroner's inquiry. I believe there was foul  play--of some sort. I'm still following things up--quietly. And--I'll  tell you something--between ourselves--I've made an important discovery.  It's this. On the evening of Braden's arrival at the Mitre he was out,  somewhere, for a whole two hours--by himself.\"    \"I thought we learned from Mrs. Partingley that he and the other man,  Dellingham, spent the evening together?\" said Bryce.    \"So we did--but that was not quite so,\" replied Mitchington. \"Braden  went out of the Mitre just before nine o'clock and he didn't return  until a few minutes after eleven. Now, then, where did he go?\"    \"I suppose you're trying to find that out?\" asked Bryce, after a pause,  during which the listeners heard the caller rise and make for the door.    \"Of course!\" replied Mitchington, with a confident laugh. \"And--I shall!  Keep it to yourself, doctor.\"    When Bryce had let the inspector out and returned to his sitting-room,  Ransford and Mary had come from behind the curtains. He looked at them  and shook his head.    \"You heard--a good deal, you see,\" he observed.    \"Look here!\" said Ransford peremptorily. \"You put that man off about the  call at my surgery. You didn't tell him the truth.\"    \"Quite right,\" assented Bryce. \"I didn't. Why should I?\"    \"What did Braden ask you?\" demanded Ransford. \"Come, now?\"    \"Merely if Dr. Ransford was in,\" answered Bryce, \"remarking that he had  once known a Dr. Ransford. That was--literally--all. I replied that you  were not in.\"    Ransford stood silently thinking for a moment or two. Then he moved  towards the door.    \"I don't see that any good will come of more talk about this,\" he said.  \"We three, at any rate, know this--I never saw Braden when he came to my  house.\"    Then he motioned Mary to follow him, and they went away, and Bryce,  having watched them out of sight, smiled at himself in his mirror--with  full satisfaction.          CHAPTER XII. MURDER OF THE MASON'S LABOURER      It was towards noon of the very next day that Bryce made a forward step  in the matter of solving the problem of Richard Jenkins and his tomb  in Paradise. Ever since his return from Barthorpe he had been making  attempts to get at the true meaning of this mystery. He had paid so  many visits to the Cathedral Library that Ambrose Campany had asked him  jestingly if he was going in for archaeology; Bryce had replied that  having nothing to do just then he saw no reason why he shouldn't improve  his knowledge of the antiquities of Wrychester. But he was scrupulously  careful not to let the librarian know the real object of his prying and  peeping into the old books and documents. Campany, as Bryce was very  well aware, was a walking encyclopaedia of information about Wrychester  Cathedral: he was, in fact, at that time, engaged in completing a  history of it. And it was through that history that Bryce accidentally  got his precious information. For on the day following the interview  with Mary Bewery and Ransford, Bryce being in the library was treated  by Campany to an inspection of certain drawings which the librarian had  made for illustrating his work-drawings, most of them, of old brasses,  coats of arms, and the like,--And at the foot of one of these, a drawing  of a shield on which was sculptured three crows, Bryce saw the name  Richard Jenkins, armiger. It was all he could do to repress a start and  to check his tongue. But Campany, knowing nothing, quickly gave him the  information he wanted.    \"All these drawings,\" he said, \"are of old things in and about the  Cathedral. Some of them, like that, for instance, that Jenkins shield,  are of ornamentations on tombs which are so old that the inscriptions  have completely disappeared--tombs in the Cloisters, and in Paradise.  Some of those tombs can only be identified by these sculptures and  ornaments.\"    \"How do you know, for instance, that any particular tomb or monument is,  we'll say, Jenkins's?\" asked Bryce, feeling that he was on safe ground.  \"Must be a matter of doubt if there's no inscription left, isn't it?\"    \"No!\" replied Campany. \"No doubt at all. In that particular case,  there's no doubt that a certain tomb out there in the corner of  Paradise, near the east wall of the south porch, is that of one Richard  Jenkins, because it bears his coat-of-arms, which, as you see, bore  these birds--intended either as crows or ravens. The inscription's clean  gone from that tomb--which is why it isn't particularized in that chart  of burials in Paradise--the man who prepared that chart didn't know  how to trace things as we do nowadays. Richard Jenkins was, as you may  guess, a Welshman, who settled here in Wrychester in the seventeenth  century: he left some money to St. Hedwige's Church, outside the  walls, but he was buried here. There are more instances--look at this,  now--this coat-of-arms--that's the only means there is of identifying  another tomb in Paradise--that of Gervase Tyrrwhit. You see his armorial  bearings in this drawing? Now those--\"    Bryce let the librarian go on talking and explaining, and heard all he  had to say as a man hears things in a dream--what was really active in  his own mind was joy at this unexpected stroke of luck: he himself might  have searched for many a year and never found the last resting-place of  Richard Jenkins. And when, soon after the great clock of the Cathedral  had struck the hour of noon, he left Campany and quitted the Library, he  walked over to Paradise and plunged in amongst its yews and cypresses,  intent on seeing the Jenkins tomb for himself. No one could suspect  anything from merely seeing him there, and all he wanted was one glance  at the ancient monument.    But Bryce was not to give even one look at Richard Jenkins's tomb that  day, nor the next, nor for many days--death met him in another form  before he had taken many steps in the quiet enclosure where so much of  Wrychester mortality lay sleeping.    From over the topmost branches of the old yew trees a great shaft  of noontide sunlight fell full on a patch of the grey walls of the  high-roofed nave. At"]]]
