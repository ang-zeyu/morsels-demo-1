[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#19)"],[1," make the tent of,--that was one swag, and a very unwieldy  one it was, strapped knapsack fashion, with straps of flax-leaves, on  the back, and the bearer's coat and waistcoat fastened on the top of the  whole. The next load consisted of one small single blanket for my  sole use, inside of which was packed a cold leg of lamb. I carried the  luncheon basket, also strapped on my shoulders, filled with two large  bottles of cream, some tea and sugar, and, I think, teaspoons. It looked  a very insignificant load by the side of the others, but I assure you I  found it frightfully heavy long before I had gone half-way up the hill.  The rest distributed among them a couple of large heavy axes, a small  coil of rope, some bread, a cake, tin plates and pannikins, knives  and forks, and a fine pigeon-pie. Concerning this pie there were two  abominable propositions; one was to leave it behind, and the other  was to eat it then and there: both of these suggestions were, however,  indignantly rejected. I must not forget to say we included in the  commissariat department two bottles of whisky, and a tiny bottle of  essence of lemon, for the manufacture of toddy. We never see a real  lemon, except two or three times a year when a ship arrives from the  Fiji islands, and then they are sixpence or a shilling apiece. All these  things were divided into two large heavy \"swags,\" and to poor F---- was  assigned the heaviest and most difficult load of all--the water. He  must have suffered great anxiety all the way, for if any accident had  happened to his load, he would have had to go back again to refill his  big kettle; this he carried in his hand, whilst a large tin vessel with  a screw lid over its mouth was strapped on his back also full of water,  but he was particularly charged not to let a drop escape from the spout  of the kettle; and I may mention here, that though he took a long time  about it, for he could not go as straight up the hill as we did, he  reached the top with the kettle full to the brim--the other vessel  was of course quite safe. All these packings and repackings, and the  comfortable adjustment of the \"swags,\" occupied a long time, so it was  past five when we began our climb, and half-past six when we reached the  top of the hill, and getting so rapidly dark that we had to hurry our  preparations for the night, though we were all so breathless that  a \"spell\" (do you know that means _rest_?) would have been most  acceptable. The ascent was very steep, and there were no sheep-tracks to  guide us; our way lay through thick high flax-bushes, and we never could  have got on without their help. I started with a stick, but soon threw  it aside and pulled myself up by the flax, hand over hand. Of course  I had to stop every now and then to rest, and once I chose the same  flax-bush where three young wild pigs had retired for the night, having  first made themselves the most beautiful bed of tussock grass bitten  into short lengths; the tussocks are very much scattered here, so it  must have been an afternoon's work for them; but the shepherds say these  wild pigs make themselves a fresh bed every night.    The first thing to be done was to pitch the tent on the little flat at  the very top of the hill: it was a very primitive affair; two of the  thinnest and longest pieces of totara, with which Flagpole is strewed,  we used for poles, fastening another piece lengthwise to these upright  sticks as a roof-tree: this frame was then covered with the large  double blanket, whose ends were kept down on the ground by a row of the  heaviest stones to be found. The rope we had brought up served to tie  the poles together at the top, and to fasten the blanket on them; but as  soon as the tent had reached this stage, it was discovered that the  wind blew through it from end to end, and that it afforded very little  protection. We also found it much colder at the top of this hill than  in our valley; so under these circumstances it became necessary to  appropriate my solitary blanket to block up one end of the tent and  make it more comfortable for the whole party. It was very little shelter  before this was done. The next step was to collect wood for a fire,  which was not difficult, for at some distant time the whole of the hill  must have been covered by a forest of totara trees; it has apparently  been destroyed by fire, for the huge trunks and branches which still  strew the steep sides are charred and half burnt. It is a beautiful  wood, with a strong aromatic odour, and blazed and crackled splendidly  in the clear, cool evening air, as we piled up a huge bonfire, and put  the kettle on to boil. It was quite dusk by this time, so the gentlemen  worked hard at collecting a great supply of wood, as the night promised  to be a very cold one, whilst I remained to watch the kettle, full of  that precious liquid poor F---- had carried up with such care, and to  prevent the wekas from carrying off our supper, which I had arranged  just inside the tent. In this latter task I was nobly assisted by my  little black terrier Dick, of whose sad fate I must tell you later.    By eight o'clock a noble pile of firewood had been collected, and we  were very tired and hungry; so we all crept inside the tent, which did  not afford very spacious accommodation, and began our supper. At this  point of the entertainment everybody voted it a great success; although  the wind was slowly rising and blowing from a cold point, and our  blanket-tent did not afford the perfect warmth and shelter we had fondly  credited it with. The gentlemen began to button up their coats. I had  only a light serge jacket on, so I coaxed Dick to sit at my back  and keep it warm; for, whilst our faces were roasted by the huge  beacon-fire, there was a keen and icy draught behind us. The hot tea was  a great comfort, and we enjoyed it thoroughly, and after it was over  the gentlemen lit their pipes, and I told them a story: presently we had  glees, but by ten o'clock there was no concealing the fact that we were  all very sleepy indeed; however, we still loudly declared that camping  out was the most delightful experiment. F---- and another gentleman  (that kind and most good-natured Mr. U----, who lives with us) went  outside the tent, armed with knives, and cut all the tussocks they could  feel in the darkness, to make me a bed after the fashion of the pigs;  they brought in several armfuls, and the warmest corner in the tent was  heaped with them; I had my luncheon-basket for a pillow, and announced  that I had turned in and was very comfortable, and that camping out was  charming; the gentlemen were still cheery, though sleepy; and the last  thing I remember was seeing preparations being made for what a Frenchman  of my acquaintance always will call a \"grogs.\" When I awoke, I thought I  must have slept several hours. Though the fire was blazing grandly, the  cold was intense: I was so stiff I could hardly move; all my limbs ached  dreadfully, and my sensations altogether were new and very disagreeable.  I sat up with great difficulty and many groans, and looked round: two  figures were coiled up, like huge dogs, near me; two more, moody and  sulky, were smoking by the fire; with their knees drawn up to their  noses and their hands in their pockets, collars well up round their  throats--statues of cold and disgust. To my inquiries about the hour,  the answer, given in tones of the deepest despondency, was \"Only eleven  o'clock, and the sun doesn't rise till six, and its going to be the  coldest night we've had this year.\" The speaker added, \"If it wasn't so  dark that we'd break our necks on the way, we might go home.\"    Here was a pretty end to our amusement. I slowly let myself down again,  and tried to go to sleep, but that relief was at an end for the night;  the ground seemed to grow harder every moment, or, at all events, I  ached more, and the wind certainly blew higher and keener. Dick proved  himself a most selfish doggie; he would creep round to leeward of _me_,  whilst I wanted him to let me get leeward of him, but he would not  consent to this arrangement. Whenever I heard a deeper moan or sigh than  usual, I whispered an inquiry as to the hour, but the usual reply,  in the most cynical voice, was, \"Oh, you need not whisper, nobody is  asleep.\" I heard one plaintive murmur \"Think of all our warm beds, and  of our coming up here from choice.\" I must say I felt dreadfully ashamed  of myself for my plan; it was impossible to express my contrition and  remorse, for, always excepting Mr. U----, they were all too cross to  be spoken to. It certainly was a weary, long night. About one o'clock I  pretended to want some hot tea, and the preparation for that got through  half an hour, and it warmed us a little; but everybody still was deeply  dejected, not to say morose. After an interval of only two hours more  of thorough and intense wretchedness we had a \"grogs,\" but there was no  attempt at conviviality--subdued savageness was the prevailing state of  mind. I tried to infuse a little hope into the party, by suggestions of  a speedy termination to our misery, but my own private opinion was that  we should all be laid up for weeks to come with illness. I allotted to  myself in this imaginary distribution of ills a severe rheumatic fever;  oh! how I ached, and I felt as if I never could be warm again. The fire  was no use; except to afford occupation in putting on wood; it roasted a  little bit of you at a time, and that bit suffered doubly from the cold  when it was obliged to take its share of exposure to the wind. I cannot  say whether the proverb is true of other nights, but this particular  night, certainly, was both darkest and coldest just before dawn.    At last, to our deep joy, and after many false alarms, we really all  agreed that there was a faint streak of grey in the east. My first  impulse was to set off home, and I believe I tried to get "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#19)"],[1,"would probably shoot me.  Besides, I had a queer sort of compunction about killing Laputa.  I  understood now why Arcoll had stayed his hand from murder, and I was  beginning to be of his opinion on our arch-enemy.    Then I remembered the horses tied up in the bush.  One of them I could  get with perfect safety.  I ran round the end of the store and into the  thicket, keeping on soft grass to dull my tread.  There, tied up to a  merula tree, were two of the finest beasts I had seen in Africa.  I  selected the better, an Africander stallion of the _blaauw-schimmel_, or  blue-roan type, which is famous for speed and endurance.  Slipping his  bridle from the branch, I led him a little way into the bush in the  direction of the Rooirand.    Then I spoke to Colin.  'Home with you,' I said.  'Home, old man, as if  you were running down a tsessebe.'[3]    The dog seemed puzzled.  'Home,' I said again, pointing west in the  direction of the Berg.  'Home, you brute.'    And then he understood.  He gave one low whine, and cast a reproachful  eye on me and the blue roan.  Then he turned, and with his head down  set off with great lopes on the track of the road I had ridden in the  morning.    A second later and I was in the saddle, riding hell-for-leather for the  north.      [1] Literally, 'The Hill which is not to be pointed at'.    [2] Literally, 'Very sacred thing'.    [3] A species of buck, famous for its speed.        CHAPTER X    I GO TREASURE-HUNTING    For a mile or so I kept the bush, which was open and easy to ride  through, and then turned into the path.  The moon was high, and the  world was all a dim dark green, with the track a golden ivory band  before me.  I had looked at my watch before I started, and seen that it  was just after eight o'clock.  I had a great horse under me, and less  than thirty miles to cover. Midnight should see me at the cave.  With  the password I would gain admittance, and there would wait for Laputa  and Henriques.  Then, if my luck held, I should see the inner workings  of the mystery which had puzzled me ever since the Kirkcaple shore.  No  doubt I should be roughly treated, tied up prisoner, and carried with  the army when the march began. But till Inanda's Kraal my life was  safe, and before that came the ford of the Letaba.  Colin would carry  my message to Arcoll, and at the Drift the tables would be turned on  Laputa's men.    Looking back in cold blood, it seems the craziest chain of accidents to  count on for preservation.  A dozen possibilities might have shattered  any link of it.  The password might be wrong, or I might never get the  length of those who knew it. The men in the cave might butcher me out  of hand, or Laputa might think my behaviour a sufficient warrant for  the breach of the solemnest vow.  Colin might never get to  Blaauwildebeestefontein, Laputa might change his route of march, or  Arcoll's men might fail to hold the Drift.  Indeed, the other day at  Portincross I was so overcome by the recollection of the perils I had  dared and God's goodness towards me that I built a new hall for the  parish kirk as a token of gratitude.    Fortunately for mankind the brain in a life of action turns more to the  matter in hand than to conjuring up the chances of the future.  Certainly it was in no discomfort of mind that I swung along the  moonlit path to the north.  Truth to tell, I was almost happy.  The  first honours in the game had fallen to me. I knew more about Laputa  than any man living save Henriques; I had my finger on the central  pulse of the rebellion. There was hid treasure ahead of me--a great  necklace of rubies, Henriques had said.  Nay, there must be more, I  argued.  This cave of the Rooirand was the headquarters of the rising,  and there must be stored their funds--diamonds, and the gold they had  been bartered for.  I believe that every man has deep in his soul a  passion for treasure-hunting, which will often drive a coward into  prodigies of valour.  I lusted for that treasure of jewels and gold.  Once I had been high-minded, and thought of my duty to my country, but  in that night ride I fear that what I thought of was my duty to enrich  David Crawfurd.  One other purpose simmered in my head.  I was devoured  with wrath against Henriques.  Indeed, I think that was the strongest  motive for my escapade, for even before I heard Laputa tell of the vows  and the purification, I had it in my mind to go at all costs to the  cave.  I am a peaceable man at most times, but I think I would rather  have had the Portugoose's throat in my hands than the collar of Prester  John.    But behind my thoughts was one master-feeling, that Providence had  given me my chance and I must make the most of it. Perhaps the  Calvinism of my father's preaching had unconsciously taken grip of my  soul.  At any rate I was a fatalist in creed, believing that what was  willed would happen, and that man was but a puppet in the hands of his  Maker.  I looked on the last months as a clear course which had been  mapped out for me.  Not for nothing had I been given a clue to the  strange events which were coming.  It was foreordained that I should go  alone to Umvelos', and in the promptings of my own fallible heart I  believed I saw the workings of Omnipotence.  Such is our moral  arrogance, and yet without such a belief I think that mankind would  have ever been content to bide sluggishly at home.    I passed the spot where on my former journey I had met the horses, and  knew that I had covered more than half the road. My ear had been alert  for the sound of pursuit, but the bush was quiet as the grave.  The man  who rode my pony would find him a slow traveller, and I pitied the poor  beast bucketed along by an angry rider.  Gradually a hazy wall of  purple began to shimmer before me, apparently very far off.  I knew the  ramparts of the Rooirand, and let my _schimmel_ feel my knees in his  ribs.  Within an hour I should be at the cliff's foot.    I had trusted for safety to the password, but as it turned out I owed  my life mainly to my horse.  For, a mile or so from the cliffs, I came  to the fringes of a great army.  The bush was teeming with men, and I  saw horses picketed in bunches, and a multitude of Cape-carts and light  wagons.  It was like a colossal gathering for _naachtmaal_[1] at a Dutch  dorp, but every man was black.  I saw through a corner of my eye that  they were armed with guns, though many carried in addition their spears  and shields.  Their first impulse was to stop me.  I saw guns fly to  shoulders, and a rush towards the path.  The boldest game was the  safest, so I dug my heels into the _schimmel_ and shouted for a passage.  'Make way!' I cried in Kaffir.  'I bear a message from the Inkulu.[2]  Clear out, you dogs!'    They recognized the horse, and fell back with a salute.  Had I but  known it, the beast was famed from the Zambesi to the Cape.  It was  their king's own charger I rode, and who dared question such a warrant?  I heard the word pass through the bush, and all down the road I got the  salute.  In that moment I fervently thanked my stars that I had got  away first, for there would have been no coming second for me.    At the cliff-foot I found a double line of warriors who had the  appearance of a royal guard, for all were tall men with leopard-skin  cloaks.  Their rifle-barrels glinted in the moon-light, and the sight  sent a cold shiver down my back.  Above them, among the scrub and along  the lower slopes of the kranzes, I could see further lines with the  same gleaming weapons.  The Place of the Snake was in strong hands that  night.    I dismounted and called for a man to take my horse.  Two of the guards  stepped forward in silence and took the bridle.  This left the track to  the cave open, and with as stiff a back as I could command, but a sadly  fluttering heart, I marched through the ranks.    The path was lined with guards, all silent and rigid as graven images.  As I stumbled over the stones I felt that my appearance scarcely fitted  the dignity of a royal messenger.  Among those splendid men-at-arms I  shambled along in old breeches and leggings, hatless, with a dirty  face, dishevelled hair, and a torn flannel shirt.  My mind was no  better than my body, for now that I had arrived I found my courage  gone.  Had it been possible I would have turned tail and fled, but the  boats were burned behind me, and I had no choice.  I cursed my rash  folly, and wondered at my exhilaration of an hour ago.  I was going  into the black mysterious darkness, peopled by ten thousand cruel foes.  My knees rubbed against each other, and I thought that no man had ever  been in more deadly danger.    At the entrance to the gorge the guards ceased and I went on alone.  Here there was no moonlight, and I had to feel my way by the sides.  I  moved very slowly, wondering how soon I should find the end my folly  demanded.  The heat of the ride had gone, and I remember feeling my  shirt hang clammily on my shoulders.    Suddenly a hand was laid on my breast, and a voice demanded, 'The word?'    'Immanuel,' I said hoarsely.    Then unseen hands took both my arms, and I was led farther into the  darkness.  My hopes revived for a second.  The password had proved  true, and at any rate I should enter the cave.    In the darkness I could see nothing, but I judged that we stopped  before the stone slab which, as I remembered, filled the extreme end of  the gorge.  My guide did something with the right-hand wall, and I felt  myself being drawn into a kind of passage.  It was so narrow that two  could not go abreast, and so low that the creepers above scraped my  hair.  Something clicked behind me like the turnstile at the gate of a  show.    Then we began to ascend steps, still in utter darkness, and a great  booming fell on my ear.  It was the falling river which had scared me  on my former visit, and I marvelled that I had not heard it sooner."]]]
