He noticed, during the process, that Punk  had meanwhile gone back to his lean-to, and that Hank and Defago were  at it hammer and tongs, or, rather, hammer and anvil, the little French  Canadian being the anvil. It was all very like the conventional stage  picture of Western melodrama: the fire lighting up their faces with  patches of alternate red and black; Defago, in slouch hat and moccasins  in the part of the \"badlands\" villain; Hank, open-faced and hatless,  with that reckless fling of his shoulders, the honest and deceived hero;  and old Punk, eavesdropping in the background, supplying the atmosphere  of mystery. The doctor smiled as he noticed the details; but at the same  time something deep within him--he hardly knew what--shrank a little, as  though an almost imperceptible breath of warning had touched the surface  of his soul and was gone again before he could seize it. Probably it was  traceable to that \"scared expression\" he had seen in the eyes of Defago;  \"probably\"--for this hint of fugitive emotion otherwise escaped his  usually so keen analysis. Defago, he was vaguely aware, might cause  trouble somehow ...He was not as steady a guide as Hank, for  instance ... Further than that he could not get ...    He watched the men a moment longer before diving into the stuffy tent  where Simpson already slept soundly. Hank, he saw, was swearing like a  mad African in a New York nigger saloon; but it was the swearing of  \"affection.\" The ridiculous oaths flew freely now that the cause of  their obstruction was asleep. Presently he put his arm almost tenderly  upon his comrade's shoulder, and they moved off together into the  shadows where their tent stood faintly glimmering. Punk, too, a moment  later followed their example and disappeared between his odorous  blankets in the opposite direction.    Dr. Cathcart then likewise turned in, weariness and sleep still fighting  in his mind with an obscure curiosity to know what it was that had  scared Defago about the country up Fifty Island Water way,--wondering,  too, why Punk's presence had prevented the completion of what Hank had  to say. Then sleep overtook him. He would know tomorrow. Hank would tell  him the story while they trudged after the elusive moose.    Deep silence fell about the little camp, planted there so audaciously in  the jaws of the wilderness. The lake gleamed like a sheet of black glass  beneath the stars. The cold air pricked. In the draughts of night that  poured their silent tide from the depths of the forest, with messages  from distant ridges and from lakes just beginning to freeze, there lay  already the faint, bleak odors of coming winter. White men, with their  dull scent, might never have divined them; the fragrance of the wood  fire would have concealed from them these almost electrical hints of  moss and bark and hardening swamp a hundred miles away. Even Hank and  Defago, subtly in league with the soul of the woods as they were, would  probably have spread their delicate nostrils in vain....    But an hour later, when all slept like the dead, old Punk crept from his  blankets and went down to the shore of the lake like a shadow--silently,  as only Indian blood can move. He raised his head and looked about him.  The thick darkness rendered sight of small avail, but, like the animals,  he possessed other senses that darkness could not mute. He  listened--then sniffed the air. Motionless as a hemlock stem he stood  there. After five minutes again he lifted his head and sniffed, and yet  once again. A tingling of the wonderful nerves that betrayed itself by  no outer sign, ran through him as he tasted the keen air. Then, merging  his figure into the surrounding blackness in a way that only wild men  and animals understand, he turned, still moving like a shadow, and went  stealthily back to his lean-to and his bed.    And soon after he slept, the change of wind he had divined stirred  gently the reflection of the stars within the lake. Rising among the far  ridges of the country beyond Fifty Island Water, it came from the  direction in which he had stared, and it passed over the sleeping camp  with a faint and sighing murmur through the tops of the big trees that  was almost too delicate to be audible. With it, down the desert paths of  night, though too faint, too high even for the Indian's hair-like  nerves, there passed a curious, thin odor, strangely disquieting, an  odor of something that seemed unfamiliar--utterly unknown.    The French Canadian and the man of Indian blood each stirred uneasily in  his sleep just about this time, though neither of them woke. Then the  ghost of that unforgettably strange odor passed away and was lost among  the leagues of tenantless forest beyond.          II      In the morning the camp was astir before the sun. There had been a  light fall of snow during the night and the air was sharp. Punk had done  his duty betimes, for the odors of coffee and fried bacon reached every  tent. All were in good spirits.    \"Wind's shifted!\" cried Hank vigorously, watching Simpson and his guide  already loading the small canoe. \"It's across the lake--dead right for  you fellers. And the snow'll make bully trails! If there's any moose  mussing around up thar, they'll not get so much as a tail-end scent of  you with the wind as it is. Good luck, Monsieur Defago!\" he added,  facetiously giving the name its French pronunciation for once, \"_bonne  chance!_\"    Defago returned the good wishes, apparently in the best of spirits, the  silent mood gone. Before eight o'clock old Punk had the camp to  himself, Cathcart and Hank were far along the trail that led westwards,  while the canoe that carried Defago and Simpson, with silk tent and grub  for two days, was already a dark speck bobbing on the bosom of the lake,  going due east.    The wintry sharpness of the air was tempered now by a sun that topped  the wooded ridges and blazed with a luxurious warmth upon the world of  lake and forest below; loons flew skimming through the sparkling spray  that the wind lifted; divers shook their dripping heads to the sun and  popped smartly out of sight again; and as far as eye could reach rose  the leagues of endless, crowding Bush, desolate in its lonely sweep and  grandeur, untrodden by foot of man, and stretching its mighty and  unbroken carpet right up to the frozen shores of Hudson Bay.    Simpson, who saw it all for the first time as he paddled hard in the  bows of the dancing canoe, was enchanted by its austere beauty. His  heart drank in the sense of freedom and great spaces just as his lungs  drank in the cool and perfumed wind. Behind him in the stern seat,  singing fragments of his native chanties, Defago steered the craft of  birch bark like a thing of life, answering cheerfully all his  companion's questions. Both were gay and light-hearted. On such  occasions men lose the superficial, worldly distinctions; they become  human beings working together for a common end. Simpson, the employer,  and Defago the employed, among these primitive forces, were simply--two  men, the \"guider\" and the \"guided.\" Superior knowledge, of course,  assumed control, and the younger man fell without a second thought into  the quasi-subordinate position. He never dreamed of objecting when  Defago dropped the \"Mr.,\" and addressed him as \"Say, Simpson,\" or  \"Simpson, boss,\" which was invariably the case before they reached the  farther shore after a stiff paddle of twelve miles against a head wind.  He only laughed, and liked it; then ceased to notice it at all.    For this \"divinity student\" was a young man of parts and character,  though as yet, of course, untraveled; and on this trip--the first time  he had seen any country but his own and little Switzerland--the huge  scale of things somewhat bewildered him. It was one thing, he realized,  to hear about primeval forests, but quite another to see them. While to  dwell in them and seek acquaintance with their wild life was, again, an  initiation that no intelligent man could undergo without a certain  shifting of personal values hitherto held for permanent and sacred.    Simpson knew the first faint indication of this emotion when he held the  new. 303 rifle in his hands and looked along its pair of faultless,  gleaming barrels. The three days' journey to their headquarters, by lake  and portage, had carried the process a stage farther. And now that he  was about to plunge beyond even the fringe of wilderness where they were  camped into the virgin heart of uninhabited regions as vast as Europe  itself, the true nature of the situation stole upon him with an effect  of delight and awe that his imagination was fully capable of  appreciating. It was himself and Defago against a multitude--at least,  against a Titan!    The bleak splendors of these remote and lonely forests rather  overwhelmed him with the sense of his own littleness. That stern quality  of the tangled backwoods which can only be described as merciless and  terrible, rose out of these far blue woods swimming upon the horizon,  and revealed itself. He understood the silent warning. He realized his  own utter helplessness. Only Defago, as a symbol of a distant  civilization where man was master, stood between him and a pitiless  death by exhaustion and starvation.    It was thrilling to him, therefore, to watch Defago turn over the canoe  upon the shore, pack the paddles carefully underneath, and then proceed  to \"blaze\" the spruce stems for some distance on either side of an  almost invisible trail, with the careless remark thrown in, \"Say,  Simpson, if anything happens to me, you'll find the canoe all correc' by  these marks;--then strike doo west into the sun to hit the home camp  agin, see?\"    It was the most natural thing in the world to say, and he said it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10912"],[0,"The Infant's Delight: Poetry (#2)"],[1,"10.      When A-pril skies be-gin to frown,  And the cold rain comes pelt-ing down,  We must not grum-ble nor com-plain,  Nor i-dly say, we hate the rain.

Who would have thought there could a-bound    Such beau-ty and de-light  Be-neath the cold and win-try ground    That hid those flow-ers from sight?    That pow-er which made and governs all--    The might-y pow-er of God--  A-lone could life and beau-ty call    Out of the life-less sod.    And He, who from the Win-ter's gloom    Can Sum-mer thus dis-close,  Shall one day make the de-sert bloom,    And blos-som as the rose.

Though in the corn that waves a-round    Are thorns, and many hurt-ful weeds,  That spring in e-ven good-ly ground    And plant-ed thick with choic-est seeds;    Though in our hearts, how-e-ver taught    And trained to guard them-selves from sin,  The good is mixed with evil thought    Our en-e-my has sown there-in,    God's plant-ing shall not be o'er-thrown    By world-ly weeds that cling a-bout  His corn; and what He hath not sown    Shall in His time be root-ed out.    Then, that our lives may yield their fruit,    Still let it be our con-stant prayer,  That God from out our hearts will root    All seeds He hath not plant-ed there.
