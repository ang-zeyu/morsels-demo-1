Such an enemy it could no more observe impartially than one  modern nation can another upon which it considers it necessary to make war.  Everything maintained or invented to the disadvantage of Islam was greedily  absorbed by Europe; the picture which our forefathers in the Middle Ages  formed of Mohammed's religion appears to us a malignant caricature. The  rare theologians[1] who, before attacking the false faith, tried to form a  clear notion of it, were not listened to, and their merits have only become  appreciated in our own time. A vigorous combating of the prevalent fictions  concerning Islam would have exposed a scholar to a similar treatment to  that which, fifteen years ago, fell to the lot of any Englishman who  maintained the cause of the Boers; he would have been as much of an outcast  as a modern inhabitant of Mecca who tried to convince his compatriots of  the virtues of European policy and social order.    [Footnote 1: See for instance the reference to the exposition of the  Paderborn bishop Olivers (1227) in the Paderborn review _Theologie und  Glaube_, Jahrg. iv., p. 535, etc. (_Islam_, iv., p. 186); also some of the  accounts mentioned in Gueterbock, _Der Islam im Lichte der byzantinischen  Polemik_, etc.]    Two and a half centuries ago, a prominent Orientalist,[2] who wrote  an exposition of Mohammed's teaching, felt himself obliged to give an  elaborate justification of his undertaking in his \"Dedicatio.\" He appeals  to one or two celebrated predecessors and to learned colleagues, who have  expressly instigated him to this work. Amongst other things he quotes  a letter from the Leiden professor, L'Empereur, in which he conjures  Breitinger by the bowels of Jesus Christ (\"per viscera Jesu Christi\") to  give the young man every opportunity to complete his study of the religion  of Mohammed, \"which so far has only been treated in a senseless way.\" As a  fruit of this study L'Empereur thinks it necessary to mention in the first  place the better understanding of the (Christian) Holy Scriptures by the  extension of our knowledge of Oriental manners and customs. Besides such  promotion of Christian exegesis and apologetics and the improvement of the  works on general history, Hottinger himself contemplated a double  purpose in his _Historia Orientalis_. The Roman Catholics often vilified  Protestantism by comparing the Reformed doctrine to that of Mohammedanism;  this reproach of Crypto-mohammedanism Hottinger wished \"talionis lege\" to  fling back at the Catholics; and he devotes a whole chapter (Cap. 6) of his  book to the demonstration that Bellarminius' proofs of the truth of the  Church doctrine might have been copied from the Moslim dogma. In the second  place, conforming to the spirit of the times, he wished, just as Bibliander  had done in his refutation of the Qoran, to combine the combat against  Mohammedan unbelief with that against the Turkish Empire (\"in oppugnationem  Mahometanae perfidiae et Turcici regni\").    [Footnote 2: J.H. Hottinger, _Historia Orientalis_, Zuerich, 1651 (2d.  edition 1660).]    The Turks were feared by the Europe of that time, and the significance of  their religion for their worldly power was well known; thus the  political side of the question gave Hottinger's work a special claim to  consideration. Yet, in spite of all this, Hottinger feared that his labour  would be regarded as useless, or even wicked. Especially when he is obliged  to say anything favourable of Mohammed and his followers, he thinks it  necessary to protect himself against misconstruction by the addition of  some selected terms of abuse. When mentioning Mohammed's name, he says:  \"at the mention of whom the mind shudders\" (\"ad cujus profecto mentionem  inhorrescere nobis debet animus\"). The learned Abbe Maracci, who in 1698  produced a Latin translation of the Qoran accompanied by an elaborate  refutation, was no less than Hottinger imbued with the necessity of  shuddering at every mention of the \"false\" Prophet, and Dr. Prideaux,  whose _Vie de Mahomet_ appeared in the same year in Amsterdam, abused and  shuddered with them, and held up his biography of Mohammed as a mirror to  \"unbelievers, atheists, deists, and libertines.\"    It was a Dutch scholar, H. Reland, the Utrecht professor of theology, who  in the beginning of the eighteenth century frankly and warmly recommended  the application of historical justice even towards the Mohammedan religion;  in his short Latin sketch of Islam[1] he allowed the Mohammedan authorities  to speak for themselves. In his \"Dedicatio\" to his brother and in his  extensive preface he explains his then new method. Is it to be supposed,  he asks, that a religion as ridiculous as the Islam described by Christian  authors should have found millions of devotees? Let the Moslims themselves  describe their own religion for us; just as the Jewish and Christian  religions are falsely represented by the heathen and Protestantism by  Catholics, so every religion is misrepresented by its antagonists. \"We  are mortals, subject to error; especially where religious matters are  concerned, we often allow ourselves to be grossly misled by passion.\"  Although it may cause evil-minded readers to doubt the writer's orthodoxy  he continues to maintain that truth can only be served by combating her  opponents in an honourable way.    [Footnote 1: _H. Relandi de religione Mohammedica libri duo_, Utrecht, 1704  (2d ed. 1717).]    \"No religion,\" says Reland, \"has been more calumniated than Islam,\"  although the Abbe Maracci himself could give no better explanation of the  turning of many Jews and Christians to this religion than the fact that  it contains many elements of natural truth, evidently borrowed from the  Christian religion, \"which seem to be in accordance with the law and the  light of nature\" (\"quae naturae legi ac lumini consentanea videntur\").  \"More will be gained for Christianity by friendly intercourse with  Mohammedans than by slander; above all Christians who live in the East must  not, as is too often the case, give cause to one Turk to say to another  who suspects him of lying or deceit: 'Do you take me for a Christian?'  (\"putasne me Christianum esse\"). In truth, the Mohammedans often put us to  shame by their virtues; and a better knowledge of Islam can only help to  make our irrational pride give place to gratitude to God for the undeserved  mercy which He bestowed upon us in Christianity.\" Reland has no illusions  that his scientific justice will find acceptance in a wide circle \"as he  becomes daily more and more convinced that the world wishes to be deceived  and is governed by prejudice\" (\"qui quotidie magis magisque experior mundum  decipi velle et praeconceptis opinionibus regi\").    It was not long before the scale was turned in the opposite direction,  and Islam was made by some people the object of panegyrics as devoid of  scientific foundation as the former calumnies. In 1730 appeared in London  the incomplete posthumous work of Count de Boulainvilliers, _Vie de  Mahomet,_ in which, amongst other things, he says of the Arabian Prophet  that \"all that he has said concerning the essential religious dogmas is  true, but he has not said all that is true, and it is only therein that his  religion differs from ours.\" De Boulainvilliers tells us with particular  satisfaction that Mohammed, who respected the devotion of hermits and  monks, proceeded with the utmost severity against the official clergy,  condemning its members either to death or to the abjuration of their faith.  This _Vie de Mahomet_ was as a matter of fact an anti-clerical romance, the  material of which was supplied by a superficial knowledge of Islam drawn  from secondary sources. That a work with such a tendency was sure to arouse  interest at that time, is shown by a letter from the publisher, Coderc, to  Professor Gagnier at Oxford, in which he writes: \"He [de Boulainvilliers]  mixes up his history with many political reflections, which by their  newness and boldness are sure to be well received\" (\"Il mele son Histoire  de plusieurs reflexions politiques, et qui par leur hardiesse ne manqueront  pas d'etre tres bien recues\").    Jean Gagnier however considered these bold novelties very dangerous and  endeavoured to combat them in another _Vie de Mahomet_, which appeared from  his hand in 1748 at Amsterdam. He strives after a \"juste milieu\" between  the too violent partisanship of Maracci and Prideaux and the ridiculous  acclamations of de Boulainvilliers. Yet this does not prevent him in his  preface from calling Mohammed the greatest villain of mankind and the most  mortal enemy of God (\"le plus scelerat de tous les hommes et le plus mortel  ennemi de Dieu\"). His desire to make his contemporaries proof against the  poison of de Boulainvilliers' dangerous book gains the mastery over the  pure love of truth for which Reland had so bravely striven.    Although Sale in his \"Preliminary Discourse\" to his translation of the  Qoran endeavours to contribute to a fair estimation of Mohammed and his  work, of which his motto borrowed from Augustine, \"There is no false  doctrine that does not contain some truth\" (\"nulla falsa doctrina est  quae non aliquid veri permisceat\"), is proof, still the prejudicial view  remained for a considerable time the prevalent one. Mohammed was branded  as _imposteur_ even in circles where Christian fanaticism was out of the  question. Voltaire did not write his tragedy _Mahomet ou le fanatisme_ as  a historical study; he was aware that his fiction was in many respects at  variance with history. In writing his work he was, as he himself expresses  it, inspired by \"l'amour du genre humain et l'horreur du fanatisme.\" He  wanted to put before the public an armed Tartufe and thought he might  lay the part upon Mohammed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#2)"],[1,"two camps: the first against war, the second determined to support  Austria and pursue the path chosen by the Berlin Government, no matter  what the consequences might be. The latter party included the vast bulk  of the nation; and Chauvinism dominated in the Press, theatres,  concert-halls, churches and music-halls. \"Patriotic\" demonstrations were  held before Austrian consulates, in restaurants and coffee-houses. The  Berlin Government was overwhelmed with telegrams from all kinds of  bodies--especially those with a military colouring, such as veterans'  clubs, societies of one-year volunteers, university societies,  etc.--calling upon it to defend Germany's honour against Slavonic murder  and intrigue. In short, all Germany gave itself up to a veritable  _Kriegsrausch_ (war intoxication) which found expression in the wildest  attacks on Russia and a perfervid determination to see the matter  through, should Russia venture to intervene in any way to protect Serbia  from whatever measures Austria thought proper to take.    It is little to be wondered at that Russia in face of this spontaneous  outbreak did take military precautions, for all Germany made it  perfectly clear that no kind of intervention on Russia's part in the  Austro-Serbian dispute would be tolerated by Germany. It is true that,  late in the day, Austria avowed that she had no intention of annexing  Serbian territory, a declaration which Germans did not believe, and  certainly one which Russia had no reason to accept after Austria's  annexion of Bosnia and Herzegowina in 1908.    Furthermore, Austria gave Russia every reason to cherish suspicion as to  her intentions. On July 25th Austria issued official orders for the  mobilization of eight of her sixteen army corps, in addition to which a  part of the _Landsturm_ was called up. The corps mobilized were: one  each in Upper and Lower Austria, Dalmatia, Buda-Pest, Croatia and Bosnia  and two Bohemian corps. Three-eighths of the forces called up were thus  placed very near to the Russian frontier.    Vienna was wild with war-enthusiasm which found expression in  demonstrations lasting all through the night, July 25-26th. Austrian  officers, who have always been hated by the populace, were cheered,  embraced and carried shoulder-high wherever they were met. The effect  which this had in Berlin may be seen from the _Berliner Tageblatt_ of  July 26th: \"An enormous mass of people gathered before the Russian  Embassy last night between the hours of twelve and one. The crowd howled  and hissed, and cries were raised: 'Down with Russia! Long live Austria!  Down with Serbia!' Gradually the police cleared the masses away.\"    Russia ignored the incident, but when about a hundred Frenchmen  demonstrated before the Austrian Embassy in Paris at exactly the same  time, the Ambassador at once protested at the Quai d'Orsay and the  Director of the French Foreign Office immediately apologized.    On the whole the reports of excesses in various parts of Germany against  any and all who dared to show any anti-war sympathies proves clearly  that the blood-lust aroused by the German Government's policy had  already passed beyond the control of the authorities. In Munich one of  the most modern coffee-houses (Cafe Fahrig) was completely gutted  because the proprietor endeavoured to keep the demonstrants within  reasonable bounds. Serbs and Russians were attacked and ill-treated. One  such incident occurred at mid-day, Sunday, July 26th, in Munich, of  which a full description is given in the _Muenchen-Augsburger  Abendzeitung_ for the following day.    A few days later (August 2nd) the Princess Cafe, Berlin, was demolished  because the guests believed that there were Russians in the band. In  Hamburg on the following day a newly-opened restaurant was completely  destroyed because a young Dane had failed to stand up when the national  hymn was being played. \"Yesterday a young Dane remained sitting during  the singing of the national hymn, for which reason the persons in the  hall became greatly excited. 'Russian, stand up!' was shouted to him. In  the same moment blows began to rain down upon him, so that, streaming  with blood, he was carried out.\" (_Berliner Zeitung am Mittag_, August  4th.)    These are only a selection of many such incidents which show that the  national brutishness was appearing through the veneer. In the light of  such events where, on German soil, Germans murderously attacked their  fellow-countrymen on such ridiculous pretexts, it requires little  imagination to explain the outburst of brutality against Belgians who  dared to defend hearth and home.    Meanwhile the smaller party which desired peace had not been entirely  idle. On July 28th the Social Democrats held thirty-two mass meetings in  Berlin to protest against war. \"The attendance was in every case  enormous, but the meetings were all orderly and calm. The police had  taken extensive precautionary measures. The speakers were mostly members  of the Reichstag or the Berlin Town Council. Throughout they were guilty  of the most fiery and tactless attacks on Austria, _to whom alone they  ascribed the guilt for the warlike developments_. Each meeting adopted a  resolution against war. The chief of police had forbidden all  processions or demonstrations to take place after the day before. In  spite of this, many of the Socialists who had attended these meetings  tried to form processions, especially in Unter den Linden. As large  bodies of troops had closed the streets, small parties of the Socialists  managed to reach the Linden by means of trams and omnibuses. At about 10  p.m. hisses and cries of 'Down with the war party!' were heard before  the Cafe Kranzler. In a moment the number of Democrats swelled to large  proportions and the workmen's Marseillaise was struck up, followed by a  short, sharp order. The mounted police advanced with drawn swords  against the rioters; the air was filled with shouts and cries of _Pfui_!  (Shame!). On the other side of the road the crowd sang the national  hymn. The masses clashed together, and the police advanced again and  again till the street was cleared. At the corner, however, the  Socialists formed up again, and began to demonstrate anew, so that the  police were compelled to attack them without any consideration in order  to preserve the peace. They cleared the pavements and galloped up the  promenade. Again the cry echoed 'Down with war!' and as answer came 'die  Wacht am Rhein.' But it was some considerable time before the struggle  ceased to surge to and fro.\" (_Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, July  29th.)    Thus the great Socialist-International-Pacifist movement, with four and  a quarter million German voters behind it, fizzled out on the pavements  of Unter den Linden. Probably there were demonstrations in other parts  of Germany, but this much is certain, that the members of Catholic and  Protestant _Arbeiterverbaende_ (Workmen's Societies) held meetings and  demonstrated in favour of war. On the other hand the Women's Union of  the German Peace Society in Stuttgart sent a telegram to the Kaiser,  begging him in the name of \"millions of German mothers\" to preserve the  peace.    The most interesting protest against the war movement is undoubtedly the  following: \"This, then, is the cultural height to which we have  attained. Hundreds of thousands of the healthiest, finest, most valuable  forces in the nation are trembling from anxiety that chance, or a nod of  Europe's rulers, malevolence, or a fit of Sadism, a Caesar-madness or a  business speculation, an empty word or a vague conception of honour,  will drive them to-morrow out of their homes, from wife and child, from  all that which they treasure and have built up with so much pain and  trouble--into death. The mad coincidence may arise to-day, may call them  to-morrow, or at any minute, and all, all of them will go--obeying  damnable necessity, but still obeying. At first they will whine on  seeing their bit of earthly happiness snatched away, but soon,  however--although their consciences may not be quite clean--they will be  possessed by the general frenzy to murder and be murdered.\" Franz  Pfemfert in _die Aktion_.    Although this article appeared on August 1st, it had evidently been  written before the proclamation of martial law. It was one of the last  political articles which the paper published, for the next number but  one contains the announcement that \"the _Aktion_ will in future only  publish articles on art and literature.\" The reasons are not far to  seek.    In justice to the pacifist elements it must be stated that they were up  against bayonets. The only pity is that British public opinion, or any  section of it, had been led to believe that it could ever have been  otherwise. Austria had committed an unpardonable act of provocation,  which at first reasonable opinion in Germany openly condemned.  Simultaneously the German Government set in motion an avalanche of  racial feeling to play off against the just and moderate measures taken  by other powers to checkmate Austrian aggression. In addition to the  racial hostility, which had been lashed into bitterness during the  spring of 1914, came Germany's morbid conception of national and  personal honour. Lastly the fear of a Russian invasion was astutely  inoculated into the nation.    It is the author's firm conviction, and the military events in Poland  and Galicia have only strengthened this opinion, that from the very  beginning Germany could have prevented any Russian invasion of her  territory, but she did not desire that end, but rather that the fear of  Russia should complete the \"Kriegsrausch\" of the German nation. After  frightening the people the Berlin Government struck its blow in the  direction of their political ambitions--to the West, and after the  Russians had been allowed to penetrate German territories they were  hurled over the Eastern "]]]
