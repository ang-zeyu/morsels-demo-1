So don't make any  other plans.\"    \"We are in the hands of our friends,\" said Hippy, with an exaggerated  bow.    \"You'll be in the hands of the law if you don't mend your ways,\"  prophesied Reddy. \"If we get you safely into the theatre without  official assistance it will surprise me very much.\"    \"Reddy, you amaze me,\" responded Hippy reproachfully. \"I may make  mistakes, but I am far from lawless. Neither do I flaunt the flame  colored signal of anarchy every time I remove my hat.\"    There was a burst of good-natured laughter at Reddy's expense. His red  hair was as common a subject of joke as was Hippy's behavior.    \"That was a fair exchange of compliments,\" said Tom Gray. \"Now forget  it, both of you.\"    \"Good-bye, every one, until eleven o'clock,\" cried Anne, who, knowing  that she would be obliged to hurry away, had brought her wraps to the  dining room with her.    David accompanied Anne to the entrance of the hotel, put her in a  taxicab and walked into the hotel, hardly knowing whether he were glad  or sorry that Anne had had greatness thrust upon her.          CHAPTER XVIII    THE THEATRE PARTY      It was a very merry party that took possession of the box that Mr.  Southard had placed at their disposal and waited with ill-concealed  impatience for the rise of the curtain.    Anne's friends had thought her the ideal \"Rosalind\" in the High School  production of the piece, but her powers as an actress under the constant  instruction of Everett Southard had increased tenfold. His own marvelous  work was a source of inspiration to Anne, and from the instant that she  set foot upon the stage until the final fall of the curtain she became  and was \"Rosalind.\"    Thrilling with pride as she eagerly watched Anne's triumph, Grace was in  a maze of delight, and every round of applause that Anne received was as  music to her ears. David, too, was more deeply moved than he liked to  admit even to himself. In his own heart he had a distinct fear that in  spite of her assertions to the contrary, Anne might after all yield to  the call of her talent and seek a stage career. During the evening he  became so unusually grave and silent that Grace, having an inkling of  what was passing in his mind, leaned over and said:    \"Don't worry, David, she won't. I am sure of it. Her mind is fixed upon  college.\"    David drew a long breath of almost relief. \"I believe it if you say so,  Grace; it has worried me a lot, however. She is such a wonderful little  actress.\"    \"Nevertheless, take my word for it, she won't,\" was the assuring answer.    After the play was over, the visit behind the scenes being next on the  programme, Mrs. Gibson and her charges were conducted through a long  passage to the back of the house. The boys were taken to Mr. Southard's  dressing room, and Mrs. Gibson and the five girls to Anne's.    There were many exclamations over the cosy dressing room which Anne  occupied. As is the case in most of the recently built theatres, the  star's dressing room had been comfortably furnished and was in direct  comparison to the cheerless, barn-like rooms that make life on the road  a terror to professional people.    \"You see, I have had you right with me,\" smiled Anne, who was seated at  a dressing table taking off her make-up with cold cream. She pointed to  a photograph that the Phi Sigma Tau had had taken the previous summer.    \"Only one face missing to-night,\" said Grace in low tones as she drew  her chair close to Anne's.    \"Have you found out anything else?\" asked Anne in the same guarded  tones.    \"Nothing very important,\" replied Grace. \"Marian and Henry Hammond have  had some sort of quarrel. Nora saw them pass the other day without  speaking.\"    \"That's a step in the right direction\", said Anne. \"Once she has dropped  him for good and all, she'll begin to see her own folly. Then she'll  come back and be her old self again.\"    \"I hope so,\" sighed Grace.    Then the conversation became general and the two girls had no further  opportunity for discussion of the subject.    Just as Anne had completed her dressing, a knock sounded on the door,  and Mr. Southard's deep voice called out:    \"All aboard for the actors' retreat.\"    \"Come in, Mr. Southard,\" said Anne, and the door opened to admit the  eminent actor, who looked bigger and handsomer than ever in his long  coat and soft black hat.    Then Anne presented him to Mrs. Gibson, and a general handshaking  ensued.    For the third time that night they were handed into the \"uncomplaining  but over-worked taxicab,\" according to Nora's version, and set out for  the Southard home.    The entire party promptly fell in love with Miss Southard, who was the  counterpart of her brother, except that she was considerably older, and  she apparently returned their liking from the moment of meeting.    \"I know every one of you,\" she said. \"Anne talks of no one else to me.  Your fame has already preceded you.\"    The Southards proved to be hospitable entertainers, and exerted every  effort in behalf of their young guests. The time slipped by on wings,  and it was well after one o'clock before any one thought of returning to  the hotel.    \"I am not a very reliable chaperon,\" laughed Mrs. Gibson, \"to allow my  charges to keep such late hours as this.\"    \"It's only once in a life time,\" remarked Nora.    \"How very cruel,\" said Mr. Southard solemnly. \"I had hoped that you  would all honor us again with your society.\"    \"I didn't mean that,\" she cried, laughing a little. \"I only meant that  this was a red-letter night for us. We are basking in the light of  greatness.\"    \"Very pretty, indeed,\" was the actor's reply, and he gave Nora one of  his rare, beautiful smiles that caused her to afterwards aver that he  was truly the handsomest man in the whole world.    With many expressions of pleasure for the delightful hours they had  passed, the revelers bade the Southards good night and good-bye.    \"I am going to give a special party to the Phi Sigma Tau and these young  men, when my season closes,\" announced the actor as they stood in the  wide hall for a moment before leaving. \"I trust that you may be able to  again assume the role of chaperon,\" he added to Mrs. Gibson.    \"I shall need no second invitation,\" replied Mrs. Gibson. \"But may I not  hope to see your sister and yourself at Hawks' Nest, in the near  future?\"    \"You are indeed kind,\" responded Mr. Southard. \"It would be a distinct  pleasure and perhaps I may be able to arrange it. My season is to be a  short one.\"    \"Get your things and come with us, Anne,\" teased Grace. \"We've loads of  things to talk of, and you can breakfast with us, and go to the train,  too. Please don't say no, because you won't see us again for three whole  weeks.\"    \"I give you my official permission to carry her off, this one time,  Grace,\" laughed Mr. Southard.    \"Better wear your long coat, dear. It is very cold,\" called Miss  Southard as Anne ran upstairs after her wraps.    Then the final good-byes were said and the party were driven back to  their hotel.    Mrs. Gibson invited Miriam to share her apartment, thus Grace and Anne  were left to themselves, and indulged in one of their old heart-to-heart  talks.    Breakfast the next morning was a late affair. After breakfast, the  entire party went for a drive, and after a one-o'clock luncheon repaired  to the station.    Mrs. Gibson, James Gardiner and the Phi Sigma Tau were to take the 2.30  train for Oakdale. The boys would leave at five o'clock. Tom and Arnold  were to travel part of the journey with David, Hippy and Reddy. Then  their ways diverged.    The girls kissed and embraced Anne tenderly, then there was a rush for  the ferry. They stood on the deck waving to her until they could  scarcely see the flutter of her handkerchief. After agreeing to meet the  boys at the ferry, David escorted Anne back to the Southard's and spent  a brief half hour with her.    \"Promise me, Anne,\" said David earnestly, as he was leaving, \"that you  won't accept any engagement that you may receive an offer of.\"    \"Of course not, you foolish David,\" replied Anne. \"Notwithstanding the  fact that you won't believe me, I solemnly promise to run from  prospective managers, as I would from small-pox, and there's my hand  upon it.\"    \"I am satisfied,\" answered David, grasping her out-stretched hand. \"I  know you will keep your word.\"          CHAPTER XIX    GRACE MEETS WITH A REBUFF      During the journey to Oakdale, Anne and the Southards formed the chief  topic of conversation. It was jointly agreed that Anne had been  fortunate indeed in winning the friendship of the great actor and his  charming sister.    \"They treat her as though she were their own sister,\" remarked Eva  Allen. \"They will miss her sadly when she leaves them.\"    \"Every one misses Anne,\" said Miriam Nesbit. \"She is so sweet and  lovable that she simply draws one's affection to her. I am frightfully  jealous of Grace.\"    \"Yes, Grace is Anne's favorite,\" said Jessica. \"Anne would give her life  for Grace if it were necessary.\"    \"And Mabel Allison feels the same way toward you, Jessica,\" interposed  Grace.    \"How I wish Mabel had been with us,\" sighed Jessica.    \"I received a letter from Mrs. Allison, just before leaving Oakdale,\"  said Mrs. Gibson. \"She expects to come east in June. Mabel has set her  heart upon being here for commencement week. I shall invite the  Southards, too, and perhaps your people will lend you to me for the week  following graduation.\"    \"We should love to go,\" said Grace, and her friends echoed her answer.    Before their journey ended night closed in around them. They had dinner  in the dining car, and after dinner the girls began to feel a trifle  tired and sleepy.    James Gardiner had discovered a boy friend on the train and had been  graciously granted permission by the Phi Sigma Tau "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#19)"],[1,"gold      Of the Rhine 'twas wrought;      He who cunningly forged it,      And lost it in shame,      Laid a curse on it      Which, for all time,      The owner thereof      Dooms to his death.

SIEGFRIED    No meal at all is mine;      I beg of you      To share with me your spoil.    HAGEN        No luck at all?    SIEGFRIED    I sought for forest-game,  But water-fowl only I found;  Furnished with the right equipment,  A brood of three wild water-birds  I had caught and brought you.  Down there on the Rhine they told me  That slain to-day I should fall.            [_Gunther starts and looks darkly at Hagen.          Siegfried lies down between Gunther and Hagen._    HAGEN    A sorry chase were that  If the luckless hunter fell  A victim to the quarry!    SIEGFRIED    Thirst plagues me!    HAGEN            [_Whilst he orders a drinking-horn to be filled for          Siegfried, and hands it to him._      It has been rumoured, Siegfried, That thou canst tell the meaning Of  what the birds sing: Does rumour speak true?      SIEGFRIED      I have not listened For long to their song.              [_He takes the drinking-horn and turns with it to          Gunther, to whom he offers it after he has drunk          from it._      Drink, Gunther, drink! Thy brother hands the draught!

HAGEN    But thou didst hear them once?    SIEGFRIED            [_Turning with animation to Gunther._        Hei! Gunther!      Moody-faced man!      Come, I will tell thee      Tales of my boyhood,  If thou wouldst care to hear them.    GUNTHER    'Twould please me much.            [_All lie down close to Siegfried, who alone fits          upright._    HAGEN    Sing, hero, sing!    SIEGFRIED        Mime was      A surly old dwarf      Who because of greed      Reared me with care,      That when the childµ      Grew sturdy and bold  He might slay a dragon grim  That guarded treasure in the wood.      He taught me to forge      And the art of fusing,      But what the craftsman      Could not achieve      The scholar did      By skill and by daring--  Out of the splinters of a weapon  Fashioned featly a sword.      My father's blade      Forged was afresh;      Strong and true      Nothung was tempered,      Deemed by the dwarf      Fit for the fight.  The wood then we sought, and there  The dragon Fafner I slew.        Listen and heed      Well to my tale;  I have marvels to tell you.      From the dragon's blood      My fingers were burning,  And these I raised to my lips;      And barely touched      Was the blood by my tongue,  When what a bird was saying  Above me I could hear.  On a bough it sat there and sang:      \"Hei! Siegfried now owns      All the Nibelung hoard!      Oh! could he the hoard      In the cave but find!  Tarnhelm, if he could but win it,  Would help him to deeds of renown;  And could he discover the ring,  It would make him the lord of the world!\"    HAGEN    Didst thou take  The Tarnhelm and ring?    A VASSAL    Was that the end of the singing?    SIEGFRIED        Having taken      Tarnhelm and ring,      Once more I listened      And heard the sweet warbler;  He sat above me and sang:--      \"Hei! Siegfried now owns      Both the helm and the ring!      Oh! let him not listen      To Mime, the false,  For Mime, too, covets the treasure,  And cunningly watches and spies!  He is bent on murdering Siegfried;  Be Siegfried wary of Mime!\"    HAGEN    'Twas well that he warned?    THE VASSALS    Got Mime due payment?    SIEGFRIED        A deadly-brewed draught      He brought me to drink;      But, fear-stricken,      His tongue stammered truly:  Nothung stretched him out dead!    HAGEN            [_With a strident laugh._    The steel that he forged not  Mime soon tasted!            [_He has another drinking-horn filled, and drops          the juice of a herb into it._    THE VASSALS    What further did the bird tell thee?    HAGEN        From my horn      Drink, hero, first:  A magical draught is this;  It will mind thee of things long forgotten,  And bring old days to remembrance.            [_He offers the horn to Siegfried, who looks into          it thoughtfully and then drinks slowly._    SIEGFRIED        In sorrow I listened,      Grieving looked up;  He sat there still and sang.      \"Hei! Siegfried has slain      The deceitful dwarf!      I know for him now      A glorious bride.  She sleeps where rugged rocks soar;  Ringed is her chamber by fire.      Who battles the flames      Wakens the bride,  Brünnhilde wins as reward!\"    HAGEN        The wood-bird's counsel      Didst thou follow?    SIEGFRIED        Straight without pause      I rose and I ran            [_Gunther listens with increasing astonishment._    Till I came to the fire-ringed rock.      I passed through the flames,      And for prize I found,            [_More and more ecstatic._    Sleeping, and clad in bright mail,  A woman lovely and dear.      The hard helmet      I loosened with care,  And waked the maid with my kiss.  Ah, then the burning, sweet embrace  Of Brünnhild's rapturous arms!

[_Siegfried starts up suddenly, and, turning his          back to Hagen, looks after the ravens. Hagen          thrusts his spear into Siegfried's back._    HAGEN    "]]]
