[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#19)"],[1,"ritualibus, iii.2), by far  the best thing that has ever been written on the subject.  ***************************************    the corresponding verbs are _haqrib_ and _haggish_, i.e.,  \"to bring near.\"  Both nouns and both verbs are used originally  for the offering of a present to the king (or the nobles) to do  him homage, to make him gracious, to support a petition  (Judges iii. 17 seq.; 1Samuel x. 27; 1Kings v. 1  [A.V. iv.21]), and from this are employed with reference to the  highest King (Malachi i.8).    DWRA QEOUS PEIQAI, DWR' )AIDOIOUS BASILHAS    The gift must not be unseasonably or awkwardly thrust upon the  recipient, not when the king's anger is at white heat, and not by  one the sight of whom he hates.    With respect to the matter of it, the idea of a sacrifice is in  itself indifferent, if the thing offered only have value of some  sort, and is the property of the offerer.  Under _qorban_ and _minha_  is included also that which the Greeks called _anathema_.  The sacred  dues which at a later date fall to the priest were without doubt  originally ordinary offerings, and amongst these are found even  wool and flax (Deut. xviii. 4; Hos. ii. 7, 11 [A.V. 5, 9] ).  But it is quite in harmony with the naivete of antiquity that as  to man so also to God that which is eatable is by preference  offered; in this there was the additional advantage, that what God  had caused to grow was thus rendered back to Him.  In doing this,  the regular form observed is that a meal is prepared in honour of  the Deity, of which man partakes as God's guest.  Offering without  any qualifying expression always means a meat or drink offering.  On this account the altar is called a table, on this account also  salt goes along with flesh, oil with meal and bread, and wine with  both; and thus also are we to explain why the flesh, according to  rule, is put upon the altar in pieces and (in the earlier period)  boiled, the corn ground or baked.  Hence also the name \"bread of  Jehovah\" for the offering (Leviticus xxi.22).  It is of course true  that \"in his offering the enlightened Hebrew saw no banquet to  Jehovah:\" but we hardly think of taking the enlightened Protestant  as a standard for the original character of Protestantism.    The manner in which the portions pertaining to God are conveyed to  Him varies.  The most primitive is the simple \"setting in order\"  [ (RK, struere] and \"pouring out\" [#pk, fundere) in the case of the  shewbread and drink offerings; to this a simple eating and  drinking would correspond.  But the most usual is burning, or, as  the Hebrews express it, \"making a savour\" (HQ+YR), to which  corresponds the more delicate form of enjoyment, that of smelling.  Originally, however, it is God Himself who consumes what the flame  consumes.  In any case the burning is a means of conveying the  offering, not, as one might perhaps be disposed to infer from the  \"sweet savour\" (RYX HNYXX Genesis viii.21), a means of preparing it.  For in ancient times the Hebrews did not roast the flesh, but  boiled it; in what is demonstrably the oldest ritual (Judges  vi. 19), the sacrifice also is delivered to the altar flame boiled;  and, moreover, not the flesh only but also the bread and the meal  are burnt.    As regards the distinction between bloodless and bloody  offerings, the latter, it is well known, are preferred in the Old  Testament, but, strictly speaking, the former also have the same  value and the same efficacy.  The incense-offering is represented  as a means of propitiation (Leviticus xvi., Numbers xvii. 12  [A.V. xvi. 47] ), so also are the ten thousands of rivers of oil  figuring between the thousands of rams and the human sacrifice in  Micah vi.  That the cereal offering is never anything but an  accompaniment of the animal sacrifice is a rule which does not hold,  either in the case of the shewbread or in that of the high priest's  daily minxa (Leviticus vi. 13 [A.V. 20]; Nehemiahx.35).  Only the  drink-offering has no independent position, and was not in any way  the importance it had among the Greeks.    When a sacrifice is killed, the offering consists not of the blood  but of the eatable portions of the flesh.  Only these can be  designated as the \"bread of Jehovah,\" and, moreover, only the  eatable domestic animals can be presented.  At the same time,  however, it is true that in the case of the bloody offerings a new  motive ultimately came to be associated with the original idea of  the gift.  The life of which the blood was regarded as the  substance (2Samuel xxiii.17) had for the ancient Semites something  mysterious and divine about it; they felt a certain religious  scruple about destroying it.  With them flesh was an uncommon  luxury, and they ate it with quite different feelings from those  with which they partook of fruits or of milk.  Thus the act of  killing was not so indifferent or merely  preparatory a step as  for example the cleansing and preparing of corn; on the contrary,  the pouring out of blood was ventured upon only in such a way as  to give it back to the Deity, the source of life.  In this way, not  by any means every meal indeed, but every slaughtering, came to  be a sacrifice.  What was primarily aimed at in it was a mere  restoration of His own to the Deity, but there readily resulted a  combination with the idea of sacrifice, whereby the latter was  itself modified in a peculiar manner.  The atoning efficacy of the  gift began to be ascribed mainly to the blood and to the  vicarious value of the life taken away.  The outpouring and  sprinkling of blood was in all sacrifices a rite of conspicuous  importance, and even the act of slaughtering in the case of some,  and these the most valued, a holy act.    II.II.2. The features presented by the various literary sources  harmonise with the foregoing sketch.  But the Priestly Code  exhibits some peculiarities by which it is distinguished from the  pre-exilian remains in matters sacrificial.    In the first place, it is characterised in the case of bloodless  offerings by a certain refinement of the material.  Thus in the  meal-offerings it will have SLT (simila) not QMX (far).  In the  whole pre-exilian literature the former is mentioned only three  times altogether, but never in connection with sacrifice, where,  on the contrary, the ordinary meal is used (Judges vi. 19; 1Samuel  i. 24).  That this is no mere accident appears on the one hand from  the fact that in the later literature, from Ezekiel onwards, QMX as  sacrificial meal entirely disappears, and SLT invariably take its  place; on the other hand, from this that the LXX (or the Hebrew  text from which that version was taken) is offended by the  illegality of the material in 1Samuel i. 24, and alters the reading  so as to bring it to conformity with the Law. /1/    ***************************************  1. Ezekiel xvi. 13, 19, xlvi. 14; I Chronicles ix. 29, xxiii. 22;  Ecclus. xxxv.2, xxxviii. 11, xxxix. 32; Isaiah i. 13 (LXX); lxvi. 3 (LXX).  In the Priestly Code slt occurs more than forty times.  **************************************     So also a striking preference is shown for incense.  With every  meal-offering incense is offered upon the altar; in the inner sanctuary  a special mixture of spices is employed, the accurately given recipe  for which is not to be followed for private purposes.  The offering  of incense is the privilege of the higher priesthood; in the  ritual of the great Day of Atonement, the sole one in which Aaron  must discharge the duties in person, it occupies a conspicuous  place.  It has an altogether dangerous sanctity; Aaron's own sons  died for not having made use of the proper fire.  It is the cause  of death and destruction to the Levites of Korah's company who are  not entitled to use it, while immediately afterwards, in the hands  of the legitimate high priest, it becomes the means of appeasing  the anger of Jehovah, and of staying the plague.  Now of this  offering, thus invested with such a halo of sanctity, the older  literature of the Jewish Canon, down to Jeremiah and Zephaniah,  knows absolutely nothing.  The verb Q++R there used invariably  and exclusively of the BURNING of fat or meal, and thereby making  to God a sweet-smelling savour; it is never used to denote the  OFFERING OF INCENSE, and the substantive Q+RT as a sacrificial  term has the quite general signification of that which is burnt on  the altar. /2/    **************************************  2. The verb is used in _piel_ by the older writers, in _hiphil_  by the Priestly Code (Chronicles), and promiscuously in both forms  during the transition period by the author of the Books of Kings.  This is the case, at least, where the forms can with certainty be  distinguished, namely, in the perfect, imperative, and infinitive;  the distinction between YQ+R and YQ+YR, MQ+R and MQ+YR rests,  as is well known, upon no secure tradition. Compare, for example,  _qatter jaqtirun_, 1Samuel ii. 16; the transcribers and punctuators  under the influence of the Pentateuch preferred the hiphil. In the  Priestly Code (Chronicles) HQ+YR has both meanings alongside of  each other, but when used without a qualifying phrase it generally  means incensing, and when consuming a sacrifice is intended HMZBXH  is usually added, \"on the altar,\" that is, the place on which the  incense-offering strictly so called was NOT offered. The substantive  Q+RT in the sense of \"an offering of incense\" in which  it occurs exclusively and very frequently in the Priestly  Code, is first found in Ezekiel (viii. 11, xvi. 18, xxiii. 41) and  often afterwards in Chronicles, but in the rest of the Old  Testament only in Proverbs xxvii. 9, but there in a profane sense.  Elsewhere never, not even in passages so late as 1Samuel ii.28; Psalms  lxvi. 15, cxli. 2.  In authors of a certainly pre-exilian date the  word occurs only twice, both times in a perfectly general sense.

As mistress of ceremonies, and on account of her great age, Aunt  Gabrielle opened the march.    Now, Aunt Gabrielle was a character. She was the living repertory  of folk-songs, legends, and customs. People came from everywhere to  consult her when they wanted to know how such and such a thing should  be done. Perhaps you believe that etiquette is peculiar to palaces.  Most assuredly not. In my day a wedding had more than a thousand  equally important formalities. My good aunt, who was the oracle of  these forms, had never made use of them for herself.    She was an old maid, born at Belle-Isle-en-Mer under Louis XV., and  was a distant cousin of ours. We have relationships in Brittany which  can be expressed in no language, they are so remote. My father, who  never thought of himself until everybody else had been provided for,  had brought out a whole tribe of poor relatives with him to St. Jean  Brévelay. I think, however, that Aunt Gabrielle was an exception.  She gave more than she received. She was our cook, I beg you to  believe, and a most excellent one too. She was active, laborious,  always equal to the expedients of her profession, always bright and  contented, full of delicate attentions for everybody, particularly  for Marguerite (my mother), her best beloved; but my good mother was  everybody's best beloved. I have never in my life known a woman to be  so universally cherished.    Aunt Gabrielle had only two faults: she spoiled children horribly,  and she gave the poor whatever she could lay her hands on. It often  happened that after a too liberal distribution of supplies among her  beggars, she would set before us at dinner a dish so ridiculously out  of proportion to the requirements of our appetites that she would  herself burst into a laugh as she looked at it. We all joined in the  laugh, which seemed to make us forget how hungry we were. She was the  factotum of the house, and was just as exacting and despotic as she  was kind.    On that night she was greatly excited; and when she came up to kiss  my mother, instead of folding her in her arms as she was in the  habit of doing, she whispered something to her with an expression of  importance and anger.    \"Calm yourself, Gabrielle; calm yourself,\" my mother said to her  several times, and I felt her hand tremble.    \"No, my dear, I cannot help it! And if you do not choose to do it, I  will do it myself.\"    \"You will do nothing of the sort,\" said my mother. \"And you will  remember that I am the mistress in my own house.\"    She pushed her gently, that the others might move along; but Aunt  Gabrielle joined the women who were going out, several of whom  stopped to speak to her. They were all making gestures of indignation  as they looked at poor Marion, who had withdrawn into the darkest  corner of the hall, and there stood with her head down and her face  turned away from them.    Finally they seemed to have taken a resolution, and they moved toward  her as though to drive her away; but they were stopped by these few  words, uttered in a low tone, and at which all the conversations  ceased at once.    \"Come to me, Marion.\"    Marion started as though she meant to spring forward; but she checked  herself and crossed the room slowly with hesitating steps. My mother  kissed her on both cheeks just as she had kissed the others. I  realized that she was performing what she considered a duty, and that  she too greatly disapproved of my poor friend.    Gabrielle held up her arms in horror.    \"Do not dare to come to work to-morrow!\" she cried aloud; \"for you  will never work for us again. I discharge you; do you understand?\"    She understood but too well. It was as though she had just heard her  death-sentence. There was no house but ours where she could find  work as a seamstress, and to discharge her was like condemning her to  starvation.    My mother's voice was heard again, low, but full of gentle firmness.    \"To-morrow Marion's work will be taken to her at her own house.\"    \"I will not be the one to take it,\" cried Aunt Gabrielle, whose words  produced a murmur of approbation.    \"Then I will take it myself,\" said my mother, \"if I can find no one  to obey me.\"    Marion had disappeared.    There were only a few women left; their cheeks were aglow with anger.  The resin candles had been put out. The room was lighted by the Yule  log only, which blazed in the fireplace.    \"Let us go and pray God,\" said my mother, slipping her arm through  that of Gabrielle, who protested and submitted at the same time, and  kissed my mother fully ten times before we reached the church.    The church was dazzling, for the simple reason that as there was no  way of lighting it, no lamps of any description, every faithful was  requested to bring a light with him. There were surely a thousand  persons in the building, which represented a thousand lights. I will  confess that these were neither lamps nor tapers nor even vulgar  tallow candles. They were mere wax lighters, which singly you may  despise as you please, but which, multiplied thus, formed a luminous  floor under the dark vault: when you looked down, it was joyous,  dazzling; and when you looked up, it was appalling. The altar fairly  glittered. All of our candles figured there in addition to those  which belonged to the church. There was just room enough between the  lights for the chalice and the missal. The rector was arrayed in a  fine scarlet chasuble, a bit worn and faded, which had survived the  Revolution. The mayor occupied the seat of honor, wearing the dress  of the Breton peasant,--blue vest embroidered in red and yellow  silk, with a splendid sun in the middle of the back. Beside him sat  the deputy mayor, M. Adelys, the miller of Kerdroguen; and both  wore white silk sashes which covered their breasts and stomachs.  The blacksmith was there too in his quality of justice's clerk,  wearing the black gown and cap of the magistracy. M. de la Goublaye,  the justice and chevalier of Saint Louis, had been detained in his  château of Keriennec by the gout. But we had a corporal of gendarmery  opposite the altar and two gendarmes on either side with yellow  shoulder-belts. Plumelec, where they lived, would have gladly enough  kept them at home on such an occasion, but St. Jean Brévelay was the  chief town of the canton.    At the appearance of the celebrant the corporal cried out,--    \"Gendarmes, hands to your sabres!\" Whereupon the music, consisting  of a fife and a drum, filled the church. That was the supreme moment  of my life. I conquered sleep so as not to miss it. I thought of it  through the whole year. You will not wonder, therefore, when I tell  you that I forgot all about Marion from midnight until about two  o'clock.    Everything was over by two o'clock. The fife and drum had escorted  the priest to the rectory; the _quinquiss_ had put out the lights  on the altar; and as all the faithful had blown upon their meagre  luminaries the church was completely dark. In a few moments it was  deserted, and not a sound was to be heard save that of the swaying  pendulum. On the other hand, the graveyard was crowded. If it  happened to be raining or snowing too hard, the people took refuge in  the houses; but they gave this proof of weakness only when they could  no longer hold out. The taverns were overflowing with customers.  Some people stood a little table out at their door, and upon it they  placed a loaf, a _cervelas_, and numerous bottles of cider, thus  defrauding, in connivance with the authority, the tax on consumable  commodities. At three o'clock the bells rang for the Mass of the  Aurora.    After the ceremony our people came for us and awaited us at the  church door with a huge red cotton umbrella, which did us as much  honor as the same utensil does a Roman cardinal. We were also  provided with an extra pair of wooden shoes half filled with warm  ashes. We hastened home, exchanging courtesies with all, but stopping  with no one; for there was a Christmas supper in our kitchen,--a  supper to which all our friends were invited, and besides them all  the servants who had been present at the blessing of the Yule log.    During midnight Mass the great kitchen table had been replaced by  boards laid as evenly as possible upon props. These were covered  by a cloth of dazzling whiteness,--the pride of my poor mother,  who used to bleach it on the grass of our meadow. On this occasion  we had candles on the table,--real candles, of seven to the pound,  which were sent for a week beforehand to Vannes. We considered our  menu decidedly sumptuous. We had buckwheat pancakes, accompanied by  numerous pots of cider and the most delicious butter. After that, we  were helped to a porringer of the very worst chocolate that was ever  manufactured by a country grocer. We tried to convince ourselves  that this course was excellent. It had to be served on that day,  and to be drunk, and to be praised, but then we had the pleasure of  feeling that we should not be called upon to repeat the sacrifice for  a year. We also had a home-cured ham and rye bread. Everybody stood  up during the _Benedicite_, then those who found room on the benches  sat down; the others helped themselves over the heads of these  privileged ones, and took their share out into the street with them.    The assailants succeeded one another until the table was cleared.  Everybody was cheerful and contented; there was never a man who  forgot himself. These peasants, who had had no breeding, were by  nature well-bred. Then they all loved one another in that country of  poor people; and, above all,--may I be allowed to say it? the thought  is so pleasing to me in my old age,--they all loved us.    I never remained"]]]
