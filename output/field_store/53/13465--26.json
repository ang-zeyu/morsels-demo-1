[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#2)"],[1," that my report, Father?\" said Mike, with a sort of sickly  interest, much as a dog about to be washed might evince in his tub.    \"It is,\" replied Mr. Jackson in measured tones, \"your report; what is  more, it is without exception the worst report you have ever had.\"    \"Oh, I say!\" groaned the record-breaker.    \"'His conduct,'\" quoted Mr. Jackson, \"'has been unsatisfactory in the  extreme, both in and out of school.'\"    \"It wasn't anything really. I only happened--\"    Remembering suddenly that what he had happened to do was to drop a  cannonball (the school weight) on the form-room floor, not once, but on  several occasions, he paused.    \"'French bad; conduct disgraceful--'\"    \"Everybody rags in French.\"    \"'Mathematics bad. Inattentive and idle.'\"    \"Nobody does much work in Math.\"    \"'Latin poor. Greek, very poor.'\"    \"We were doing Thucydides, Book Two, last term--all speeches and  doubtful readings, and cruxes and things--beastly hard! Everybody  says so.\"    \"Here are Mr. Appleby's remarks: 'The boy has genuine ability, which he  declines to use in the smallest degree.'\"    Mike moaned a moan of righteous indignation.    \"'An abnormal proficiency at games has apparently destroyed all desire  in him to realize the more serious issues of life.' There is more to the  same effect.\"    Mr. Appleby was a master with very definite ideas as to what constituted  a public-school master's duties. As a man he was distinctly pro-Mike. He  understood cricket, and some of Mike's strokes on the off gave him  thrills of pure aesthetic joy; but as a master he always made it his  habit to regard the manners and customs of the boys in his form with an  unbiased eye, and to an unbiased eye Mike in a form room was about as  near the extreme edge as a boy could be, and Mr. Appleby said as much in  a clear firm hand.    \"You remember what I said to you about your report at Christmas, Mike?\"  said Mr. Jackson, folding the lethal document and replacing it in  its envelope.    Mike said nothing; there was a sinking feeling in his interior.    \"I shall abide by what I said.\"    Mike's heart thumped.    \"You will not go back to Wrykyn next term.\"    Somewhere in the world the sun was shining, birds were twittering;  somewhere in the world lambkins frisked and peasants sang blithely at  their toil (flat, perhaps, but still blithely), but to Mike at that  moment the sky was black, and an icy wind blew over the face of  the earth.    The tragedy had happened, and there was an end of it. He made no attempt  to appeal against the sentence. He knew it would be useless, his father,  when he made up his mind, having all the unbending tenacity of the  normally easygoing man.    Mr. Jackson was sorry for Mike. He understood him, and for that reason  he said very little now.    \"I am sending you to Sedleigh,\" was his next remark.    Sedleigh! Mike sat up with a jerk. He knew Sedleigh by name--one of  those schools with about a hundred boys which you never hear of except  when they send up their gym team to Aldershot, or their Eight to Bisley.  Mike's outlook on life was that of a cricketer, pure and simple. What  had Sedleigh ever done? What were they ever likely to do? Whom did they  play? What Old Sedleighan had ever done anything at cricket? Perhaps  they didn't even _play_ cricket!    \"But it's an awful hole,\" he said blankly.    Mr. Jackson could read Mike's mind like a book. Mike's point of view was  plain to him. He did not approve of it, but he knew that in Mike's place  and at Mike's age he would have felt the same. He spoke dryly to hide  his sympathy.    \"It is not a large school,\" he said, \"and I don't suppose it could play  Wrykyn at cricket, but it has one merit--boys work there. Young Barlitt  won a Balliol scholarship from Sedleigh last year.\" Barlitt was the  vicar's son, a silent, spectacled youth who did not enter very largely  into Mike's world. They had met occasionally at tennis parties, but not  much conversation had ensued. Barlitt's mind was massive, but his topics  of conversation were not Mike's.    \"Mr. Barlitt speaks very highly of Sedleigh,\" added Mr. Jackson.    Mike said nothing, which was a good deal better than saying what he  would have liked to have said.        2    SEDLEIGH      The train, which had been stopping everywhere for the last half hour,  pulled up again, and Mike, seeing the name of the station, got up,  opened the door, and hurled a bag out on to the platform in an emphatic  and vindictive manner. Then he got out himself and looked about him.    \"For the school, sir?\" inquired the solitary porter, bustling up, as if  he hoped by sheer energy to deceive the traveler into thinking that  Sedleigh station was staffed by a great army of porters.    Mike nodded. A somber nod. The nod Napoleon might have given if somebody  had met him in 1812, and said, \"So you're back from Moscow, eh?\" Mike  was feeling thoroughly jaundiced. The future seemed wholly gloomy. And,  so far from attempting to make the best of things, he had set himself  deliberately to look on the dark side. He thought, for instance, that he  had never seen a more repulsive porter, or one more obviously  incompetent than the man who had attached himself with a firm grasp to  the handle of the bag as he strode off in the direction of the luggage  van. He disliked his voice, his appearance, and the color of his hair.  Also the boots he wore. He hated the station, and the man who took  his ticket.    \"Young gents at the school, sir,\" said the porter, perceiving from  Mike's _distrait_ air that the boy was a stranger to the place, \"goes up  in the bus mostly. It's waiting here, sir. Hi, George!\"    \"I'll walk, thanks,\" said Mike frigidly.    \"It's a goodish step, sir.\"    \"Here you are.\"    \"Thank you, sir. I'll send up your luggage by the bus, sir. Which 'ouse  was it you was going to?\"    \"Outwood's.\"    \"Right, sir. It's straight on up this road to the school. You can't miss  it, sir.\"    \"Worse luck,\" said Mike.    He walked off up the road, sorrier for himself than ever. It was such  absolutely rotten luck. About now, instead of being on his way to a  place where they probably ran a Halma team instead of a cricket eleven,  and played hunt-the-slipper in winter, he would be on the point of  arriving at Wrykyn. And as captain of cricket, at that. Which was the  bitter part of it. He had never been in command. For the last two  seasons he had been the star man, going in first, and heading the  averages easily at the end of the season; and the three captains under  whom he had played during his career as a Wrykynian, Burgess, Enderby,  and Henfrey, had always been sportsmen to him. But it was not the same  thing. He had meant to do such a lot for Wrykyn cricket this term. He  had had an entirely new system of coaching in his mind. Now it might  never be used. He had handed it on in a letter to Strachan, who would be  captain in his place; but probably Strachan would have some scheme of  his own. There is nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal way;  and there is nobody who has not a theory of his own about cricket  coaching at school.    Wrykyn, too, would be weak this year, now that he was no longer there.  Strachan was a good, free bat on his day, and, if he survived a few  overs, might make a century in an hour, but he was not to be depended  upon. There was no doubt that Mike's sudden withdrawal meant that Wrykyn  would have a bad time that season. And it had been such a wretched  athletic year for the school. The football fifteen had been hopeless,  and had lost both the Ripton matches, the return by over sixty points.  Sheen's victory in the light weights at Aldershot had been their one  success. And now, on top of all this, the captain of cricket was removed  during the Easter holidays. Mike's heart bled for Wrykyn, and he found  himself loathing Sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing.    The only thing he could find in its favor was the fact that it was set  in a very pretty country. Of a different type from the Wrykyn country,  but almost as good. For three miles Mike made his way through woods and  past fields. Once he crossed a river. It was soon after this that he  caught sight, from the top of a hill, of a group of buildings that wore  an unmistakably schoollike look.    This must be Sedleigh.    Ten minutes' walk brought him to the school gates, and a baker's boy  directed him to Mr. Outwood's.    There were three houses in a row, separated from the school buildings by  a cricket field. Outwood's was the middle one of these.    Mike went to the front door and knocked. At Wrykyn he had always charged  in at the beginning of term at the boys' entrance, but this formal  reporting of himself at Sedleigh suited his mood.    He inquired for Mr. Outwood, and was shown into a room lined with books.  Presently the door opened, and the housemaster appeared.    There was something pleasant and homely about Mr. Outwood. In appearance  he reminded Mike of Smee in _Peter Pan_. He had the same eyebrows and  pince-nez and the same motherly look.    \"Jackson?\" he said mildly.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I am very glad to see you, very glad indeed. Perhaps you would like a  cup of tea after your journey. I think you might like a cup of tea. You  come from Crofton, in Shropshire, I understand, Jackson, near  Brindleford? It is a part of the country which I have always wished to  visit. I dare say you have frequently seen the Cluniac Priory of St.  Ambrose at Brindleford?\"    Mike, who would not have recognized a Cluniac Priory if you had handed  him one on a tray, said he had not.    \"Dear me! You have missed an opportunity which I should have been glad  to have. I am preparing a book on Ruined Abbeys and Priories of England,  and it has always been my wish to see the Cluniac Priory of St. Ambrose.  A deeply interesting relic of the sixteenth century. Bishop Geoffrey,  1133-40--\"    \"Shall I go across to the boys' part, sir?\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10589"],[0,"Turkish Prisoners in Egypt (#2)"],[1,"are being treated with calomel, salol,  and emetine. Twenty per cent. were affected by ophthalmia due to their  stay in the desert before being captured. These were treated with  sulphate of zinc and protargol.    Four prisoners are suffering from trachoma of old standing. Recent cases  are ordinary ailments, bronchitis and simple diarrhoea.    As a general rule the camp prisoners look well, have a good colour and  are well nourished.    The prisoners were inoculated in Turkey against typhoid fever and  smallpox. All who no longer showed traces of vaccination were vaccinated  immediately after being captured. They were also inoculated against  cholera.    There is no typhoid fever in the camp, nor exanthematic typhus, nor any  other infectious disease.      _Work._--The prisoners have no regular work to do. No prisoner is  employed in workshops outside the camp. Even inside, except for ordinary  camp fatigue duties, and some light gardening, no labour is exacted.  During our inspection we saw the digging for a water supply through the  camp being done by Arab workmen, not by prisoners.    In any case, corporals and sergeants are not allowed to work.      _Religion and Recreation._--The prisoners are quite free to follow their  own religious practices, which are performed thrice a day ordinarily,  and six or seven times daily during Ramadan. Music and singing are  permitted; prisoners have manufactured several guitars and violins.      _Correspondence._--Most of the prisoners brought money with them; some  have received sums of money from their families through the Turkish Red  Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross. They receive the  amount in weekly instalments of 30 piastres (about 6 shillings) per  month. Each person has a separate current account with the camp  accountant.    Letters take from three weeks to three months to get from the sender to  the prisoner to whom they are addressed. Some of them are sent through  the American Consul at Cairo. Very few of the prisoners can write, but  these may do so as often and for as long as they wish. There is no  system of delaying correspondence after delivery or before despatch.      _Prisoners' Aid._--There is no relief committee in the camp; so far, no  general relief funds have been sent. Sergeant-Major Hussein Hissan, a  native of Constantinople, told us that, although there were many poor  prisoners in the camp, there was no need to send help, as all prisoners  are well fed, well clothed and supplied with tobacco.      _Prisoners' Behaviour._--What strikes one more than anything else on  entering the camp is the prevailing orderliness and cleanliness. A  Turkish sergeant-major commands each group of huts, and a Turkish  sergeant is responsible for each dormitory. The prisoners are smart,  give the military salute and come to attention at the orders of the  non-commissioned officers when those in command pass through the camp.    Sergeant-Major Hassar Mohammed, from Angora, and Hamid Abdallah, from  Koniah (Asia Minor), told us, on behalf of their fellow prisoners, that  they had no complaints to make, and assured us of the kind treatment  which they receive.    On their part, the English officers and non-commissioned officers  declared that the prisoners are well disciplined and very willing. In  short, we took away with us an excellent impression of Heliopolis Camp.          ~2. Hospital No. 2, at Abbassiah, near Cairo.~    _(Visited on January 2, 1917.)_      This hospital, on the pavilion system, and arranged in accordance with  the requirements of modern practice, is reserved exclusively for  German, Austrian, Bulgarian and Turkish prisoners of war. It is staffed  by head doctor Wickermann, assisted by four English doctors. Some  English Red Cross nurses and 18 Turkish orderlies attend to the sick and  wounded. These nurses and orderlies are engaged only with treatment. The  rough ward work and cleaning are done by native employes. The pavilions  are built of stone and separated by intervals of 32-1/2 feet. The roofs  are of cement. Along one side runs a covered gallery wherein beds and  arm-chairs are placed for the open-air cure of patients for whom it is  prescribed. The floor of the pavilions is a kind of linoleum made of  sawdust and cement, and is covered with palm mats. The windows are  large, and the cubic space per patient ample. The beds are arranged in  two rows and have spring and stuffed mattresses. Blankets are not  stinted. The rooms are scrupulously clean; and the hospital sterilising  chamber serves to disinfect the clothes, which, after being washed and  labelled, are stored in a wardrobe and handed back to the owners when  they leave the hospital. The prisoners have no trouble over them. A  large supply of things for the patients is kept in the laundry.      _Clothing._--The hospital patients wear pyjamas like those of British  soldiers; and, like the latter, convalescents wear a bright blue suit  with white facings and a red necktie. Patients able to sit up have  folding easy-chairs at their disposal.      _Dressings._--The hospital drug department is well stocked. The wounded  are supplied with surgical appliances, and with artificial limbs of the  most perfect make.    The day before our visit 80 wounded prisoners arrived at the hospital  from El Arish in an exhausted and emaciated condition. We saw each case  receive the most suitable treatment. The apparatus most generally used  for dealing with fractures consists of a metal frame with flannel strips  stretched from side to side to form a kind of trough. When the broken  limb is in position the apparatus is suspended from the ceiling by means  of pulleys. We have never seen this ingenious arrangement in any German  or French hospital; it seems to us to be a very practical idea and  likely to prove of great benefit to the wounded. At the head of each bed  is a temperature chart, a diet chart, and a clinical summary of the  case.      _Special Quarters._--The operating theatre is well arranged; a  sterilising stove is heated by paraffin. In the wards for prisoners  suffering from malaria the beds are enclosed by mosquito nets to prevent  the _anopheles_ mosquito infecting itself and then biting other patients  or people of the neighbourhood. Two wards are kept for convalescent  cases, who have a dining-room to stay in during the day.    Cases of venereal disease are also confined to separate premises.    The orderlies live in two comfortable tents in the hospital garden, one  of which, is occupied by those on day duty, the other by those on night  duty.      _Hygiene._--The water is of good quality, supplied from the Cairo water  system. The prisoners can use the well-equipped hot and cold baths at  their pleasure. Invalids wash themselves, or are washed with the aid of  bowls. Convalescents wash at the taps supplied for their use.    The latrines are on the Turkish plan, with automatic water-flush, and  discharge into the town drainage.      _Food._--The hospital management employs a contractor to do the  provisioning. The food is prepared in the kitchen by 4 Egyptian  employes. The dietary of the Turkish soldiers differs somewhat from that  of the German and Austrian prisoners, in order to suit the palates of  each. For example, the Turks prefer flat loaves, which are baked for  them; while European prisoners get what is called English bread,  toasted. Bulgarian curdled milk is prepared for dysentery patients, and  the English doctors testify to its good effects.    An ice-box in each pavilion keeps such provisions as must stay there  quite fresh. The diet for invalids is divided into full diet and milk  diet.    1. FULL DIET.     _Breakfast_: Bread; milk.     _Lunch_: Meat stew; vegetables; rice; bread.     _Supper_: Bread; soup; rice; milk.     _Extra, when ordered_: Chicken; pigeon; rabbit; butchers'     meat; lemons; eggs; cheese; curdled milk.    2. MILK DIET.     _Breakfast_: Bread; milk.     _Lunch_: Soup; bread; milk; rice.     _Supper_: Bread; milk; sugar.    The quantities of food allowed to invalids are given below:                                                    _Diet for                           _Ordinary      _Milk      Fever                              Diet.

The English doctors without  exception praise the patience and brave endurance of pain shown by the  Turkish prisoners. The cases treated in the hospital up to January 2,  1917, the date of our visit, are analysed below.
