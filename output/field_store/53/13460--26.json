ANCIENT RELIGIONS:      EGYPTIAN, ASSYRIAN, BABYLONIAN, AND PERSIAN.    It is my object in this book on the old Pagan civilizations to present  the salient points only, since an exhaustive work is impossible within  the limits of these volumes. The practical end which I have in view is  to collate a sufficient number of acknowledged facts from which to draw  sound inferences in reference to the progress of the human race, and the  comparative welfare of nations in ancient and modern times.    The first inquiry we naturally make is in regard to the various  religious systems which were accepted by the ancient nations, since  religion, in some form or other, is the most universal of institutions,  and has had the earliest and the greatest influence on the condition and  life of peoples--that is to say, on their civilizations--in every  period of the world. And, necessarily, considering what is the object in  religion, when we undertake to examine any particular form of it which  has obtained among any people or at any period of time, we must ask, How  far did its priests and sages teach exalted ideas of Deity, of the soul,  and of immortality? How far did they arrive at lofty and immutable  principles of morality? How far did religion, such as was taught,  practically affect the lives of those who professed it, and lead them to  just and reasonable treatment of one another, or to holy contemplation,  or noble deeds, or sublime repose in anticipation of a higher and  endless life? And how did the various religions compare with what we  believe to be the true religion--Christianity--in its pure and ennobling  truths, its inspiring promises, and its quiet influence in changing and  developing character?    I assume that there is no such thing as a progressive Christianity,  except in so far as mankind grow in the realization of its lofty  principles; that there has not been and will not be any improvement on  the ethics and spiritual truths revealed by Jesus the Christ, but that  they will remain forever the standard of faith and practice. I assume  also that Christianity has elements which are not to be found in any  other religion,--such as original teachings, divine revelations, and  sublime truths. I know it is the fashion with many thinkers to maintain  that improvements on the Christian system are both possible and  probable, and that there is scarcely a truth which Christ and his  apostles declared which cannot be found in some other ancient religion,  when divested of the errors there incorporated with it. This notion I  repudiate. I believe that systems of religion are perfect or imperfect,  true or false, just so far as they agree or disagree with Christianity;  and that to the end of time all systems are to be measured by the  Christian standard, and not Christianity by any other system.    The oldest religion of which we have clear and authentic account is  probably the pure monotheism held by the Jews. Some nations have claimed  a higher antiquity for their religion--like the Egyptians and  Chinese--than that which the sacred writings of the Hebrews show to have  been communicated to Abraham, and to earlier men of God treated of in  those Scriptures; but their claims are not entitled to our full  credence. We are in doubt about them. The origin of religions is  enshrouded in mystical darkness, and is a mere speculation. Authentic  history does not go back far enough to settle this point. The primitive  religion of mankind I believe to have been revealed to inspired men,  who, like Shem, walked with God. Adam, in paradise, knew who God was,  for he heard His voice; and so did Enoch and Noah, and, more clearly  than all, Abraham. They believed in a personal God, maker of heaven and  earth, infinite in power, supreme in goodness, without beginning and  without end, who exercises a providential oversight of the world  which he made.    It is certainly not unreasonable to claim the greatest purity and  loftiness in the monotheistic faith of the Hebrew patriarchs, as handed  down to his children by Abraham, over that of all other founders of  ancient religious systems, not only since that faith was, as we believe,  supernaturally communicated, but since the fruit of that stock,  especially in its Christian development, is superior to all others. This  sublime monotheism was ever maintained by the Hebrew race, in all their  wanderings, misfortunes, and triumphs, except on occasions when they  partially adopted the gods of those nations with whom they came in  contact, and by whom they were corrupted or enslaved.    But it is not my purpose to discuss the religion of the Jews in this  connection, since it is treated in other volumes of this series, and  since everybody has access to the Bible, the earlier portions of which  give the true account not only of the Hebrews and their special  progenitor Abraham, but of the origin of the earth and of mankind; and  most intelligent persons are familiar with its details.    I begin my description of ancient religions with those systems with  which the Jews were more or less familiar, and by which they were more  or less influenced. And whether these religions were, as I think,  themselves corrupted forms of the primitive revelation to primitive man,  or, as is held by some philosophers of to-day, natural developments out  of an original worship of the powers of Nature, of ghosts of ancestral  heroes, of tutelar deities of household, family, tribe, nation, and so  forth, it will not affect their relation to my plan of considering this  background of history in its effects upon modern times, through Judaism  and Christianity.           *       *       *       *       *    The first which naturally claims our attention is the religion of  ancient Egypt. But I can show only the main features and characteristics  of this form of paganism, avoiding the complications of their system and  their perplexing names as much as possible. I wish to present what is  ascertained and intelligible rather than what is ingenious and obscure.    The religion of Egypt is very old,--how old we cannot tell with  certainty. We know that it existed before Abraham, and with but few  changes, for at least two thousand years. Mariette places the era of the  first Egyptian dynasty under Menes at 5004 B.C. It is supposed that the  earliest form of the Egyptian religion was monotheistic, such as was  known later, however, only to a few of the higher priesthood. What the  esoteric wisdom really was we can only conjecture, since there are no  sacred books or writings that have come down to us, like the Indian  Vedas and the Persian Zend-Avesta. Herodotus affirms that he knew the  mysteries, but he did not reveal them.    But monotheism was lost sight of in Egypt at an earlier period than the  beginning of authentic history. It is the fate of all institutions to  become corrupt, and this is particularly true of religious systems. The  reason of this is not difficult to explain. The Bible and human  experience fully exhibit the course of this degradation. Hence, before  Abraham's visit to Egypt the religion of that land had degenerated into  a gross and complicated polytheism, which it was apparently for the  interest of the priesthood to perpetuate.    The Egyptian religion was the worship of the powers of Nature,--the sun,  the moon, the planets, the air, the storm, light, fire, the clouds, the  rivers, the lightning, all of which were supposed to exercise a  mysterious influence over human destiny. There was doubtless an  indefinite sense of awe in view of the wonders of the material universe,  extending to a vague fear of some almighty supremacy over all that could  be seen or known. To these powers of Nature the Egyptians gave names,  and made them divinities.    The Egyptian polytheism was complex and even contradictory.

From a religious point of view, Abraham appears to us, after the lapse  of nearly four thousand years, as the most august character in history.  He may not have had the genius and learning of Moses, nor his executive  ability; but as a religious thinker, inspired to restore faith in the  world and the worship of the One God, it would be difficult to find a  man more favored or more successful. He is the spiritual father equally  of Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, in their warfare with idolatry. In  this sense, he is the spiritual progenitor of all those nations, tribes,  and peoples who now acknowledge, or who may hereafter acknowledge, a  personal God, supreme and eternal in the universe which He created.  Abraham is the religious father of all those who associate with this  personal and supreme Deity a providential oversight of this world,--a  being whom all are required to worship, and alone to worship, as the  only true God whose right it is to reign, and who does reign, and will  reign forever and ever over everything that exists, animate or  inanimate, visible or invisible, known or unknown, in the mighty  universe of whose glory and grandeur we have such overwhelming yet  indefinite conceptions.    When Abraham appeared, whether four thousand or five thousand years ago,  for chronologists differ in their calculations, it would seem that the  nations then existing had forgotten or ignored this great cardinal and  fundamental truth, and were more or less given to idolatry, worshipping  the heavenly bodies, or the forces of Nature, or animals, or heroes, or  graven images, or their own ancestors. There were but few and feeble  remains of the primitive revelation,--that is, the faith cherished by  the patriarchs before the flood, and which it would be natural to  suppose Noah himself had taught to his children.    There was even then, however, a remarkable material civilization,  especially in Egypt, Palestine, and Babylon; for some of the pyramids  had been built, the use of the metals, of weights and measures, and of  textile fabrics was known. There were also cities and fortresses,  cornfields and vineyards, agricultural implements and weapons of war,  commerce and arts, musical instruments, golden vessels, ornaments for  the person, purple dyes, spices, hand-made pottery, stone-engravings,  sundials, and glass-work, and even the use of letters, or something  similar, possibly transmitted from the antediluvian civilization. Even  the art of printing was almost discovered, as we may infer from the  stamping of letters on tiles. With all this material progress, however,  there had been a steady decline in spiritual religion as well as in  morals,--from which fact we infer that men if left to themselves,  whatever truth they may receive from ancestors, will, without  supernatural influences, constantly decline in those virtues on which  the strength of man is built, and without which the proudest triumphs of  the intellect avail nothing. The grandest civilization, in its material  aspects, may coexist with the utmost debasement of morals,--as seen  among the Greeks and Romans, and in the wicked capitals of modern  Europe. \"There is no God!\" or \"Let there be no God!\" has been the cry in  all ages of the world, whenever and wherever an impious pride or a low  morality has defied or silenced conscience. Tell me, ye rationalists and  agnostics! with your pagan sympathies, what mean ye by laws of  development, and by the _necessary_ progress of the human race, except  in the triumphs of that kind of knowledge which is entirely disconnected  with virtue, and which has proved powerless to prevent the decline and  fall of nations? Why did not art, science, philosophy, and literature  save the most lauded nations of the ancient world? Why so rapid a  degeneracy among people favored not only with a primitive revelation,  but by splendid triumphs of reason and knowledge? Why did gross  superstition so speedily obscure the intellect, and infamous vices so  soon undermine the moral health, if man can elevate himself by his  unaided strength? Why did error seemingly prove as vital as truth in all  the varied forms of civilization in the ancient world? Why did even  tradition fail to keep alive the knowledge of God, at least among  the people?    Now, among pagans and idolaters Abram (as he was originally called)  lived until he was seventy-five. His father, Terah, was a descendant of  Shem, of the eleventh generation, and the original seat of his tribe was  among the mountains of Southern Armenia, north of Assyria. From thence  Terah migrated to the plains of Mesopotamia, probably with the desire to  share the rich pastures of the lowlands, and settled in Ur of the  Chaldeans. Ur was one of the most ancient of the Chaldean cities and one  of the most splendid, where arts and sciences were cultivated, where  astronomers watched the heavens, poets composed hymns, and scribes  stamped on clay tablets books which, according to Geikie, have in part  come down to our own times. It was in this pagan city that Abram was  born, and lived until the \"call.\" His father was a worshipper of the  tutelary gods of his tribe, of which he was the head; but his idolatry  was not so degrading as that of the Chaldeans, who belonged to a  different race from his own, being the descendants of Ham, among whom  the arts and sciences had made considerable progress,--as was natural,  since what we call civilization arose, it is generally supposed, in the  powerful monarchies founded by Assyrian and Egyptian warriors, although  it is claimed that both China and India were also great empires "]]]
