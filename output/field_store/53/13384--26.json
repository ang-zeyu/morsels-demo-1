And they did so.    01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning  our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought  us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.    01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,  saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,  behold, also his blood is required.    01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake  unto them by an interpreter.    01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned  to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and  bound him before their eyes.    01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to  restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for  the way: and thus did he unto them.    01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed  thence.    01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender  in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's  mouth.    01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,  it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were  afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?    01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of  Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,    01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us,  and took us for spies of the country.    01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:    01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and  the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.    01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby  shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with  me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:    01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know  that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you  your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.    01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that,  behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they  and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.    01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of  my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin  away: all these things are against me.    01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons,  if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring  him to thee again.    01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his  brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way  in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow  to the grave.    01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.    01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which  they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again,  buy us a little food.    01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly  protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother  be with you.    01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and  buy thee food:    01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the  man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with  you.    01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to  tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?    01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of  our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother?  and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we  certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?    01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,  and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and  thou, and also our little ones.    01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:  if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear  the blame for ever:    01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this  second time.    01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,  do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry  down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and  myrrh, nuts, and almonds:    01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was  brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;  peradventure it was an oversight:    01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:    01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may  send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my  children, I am bereaved.    01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in  their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood  before Joseph.    01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler  of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these  men shall dine with me at noon.    01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men  into Joseph's house.    01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into  Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in  our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion  against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.    01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they  communed with him at the door of the house,    01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy  food:    01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened  our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack,  our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.    01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy  food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.    01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God  of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.  And he brought Simeon out unto them.    01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave  them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses  provender.    01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:  for they heard that they should eat bread there.    01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which  was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the  earth.    01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father  well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?    01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,  he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.    01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his  mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake  unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.    01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his  brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,  and wept there.    01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,  and said, Set on bread.    01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by  themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by  themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews;  for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.    01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his  birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men  marvelled one at another.    01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but  Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they  drank, and were merry with him.    01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the  men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's  money in his sack's mouth.    01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the  youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that  Joseph had spoken.    01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away,  they and their asses.    01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,  Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou  dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for  good?    01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed  he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.    01:044:006 And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8001"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 1: Genesis (#19)"],[1,"she had covered her face.    01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray             thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was             his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,             that thou mayest come in unto me?    01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she             said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?    01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy             signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine             hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she             conceived by him.    01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,             and put on the garments of her widowhood.    01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the             Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but             he found her not.    01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the             harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There             was no harlot in this place.    01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and             also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in             this place.    01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:             behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.    01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told             Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the             harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And             Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.    01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,             saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she             said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and             bracelets, and staff.    01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more             righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my             son. And he knew her again no more.    01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,             twins were in her womb.    01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out             his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a             scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.    01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,             his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken             forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called             Pharez.    01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet             thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.    01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer             of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of             the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down             thither.    01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and             he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.    01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the             LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.    01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he             made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put             into his hand.    01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him             overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD             blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the             blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,             and in the field.    01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not             ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was             a goodly person, and well favoured.    01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife             cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.    01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my             master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath             committed all that he hath to my hand;    01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he             kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his             wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against             God?    01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that             he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.    01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the             house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the             house there within.    01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he             left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.    01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment             in her hand, and was fled forth,    01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto             them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to             mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a             loud voice:    01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice             and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got             him out.    01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.    01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The             Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto             me to mock me:    01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that             he left his garment with me, and fled out.    01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his             wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did             thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.    01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a             place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there             in the prison.    01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave             him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.    01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all             the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did             there, he was the doer of it.    01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was             under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which             he did, the LORD made it to prosper.    01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the             king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king             of Egypt.    01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the             chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.    01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the             guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.    01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he             served them: and they continued a season in ward.    01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in             one night, each man according to the interpretation of his             dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which             were bound in the prison.    01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon             them, and, behold, they were sad.    01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward             of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to             day?    01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is             no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not             interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.    01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to             him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;    01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it             budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof             brought forth ripe grapes:    01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and             pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into             Pharaoh's hand.    01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:             The three branches are three days:    01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and             restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's             cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his             butler.    01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew             kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto             Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:    01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:             and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into             the dungeon.    01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he             said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had             three white baskets on my head:    01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of             bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the             basket upon my head.    01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the"]]]
