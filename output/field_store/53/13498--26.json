It is nothing surprising that the different species of walrus,  inhabitants of the ocean, should feed partly on shell-fish, but perhaps  you would not expect to find among their enemies animals strictly  terrestrial. Yet the oran otang and the preacher monkey often descend to  the sea to devour what shell-fish they may find strewed upon the shores.  The former, according to Carreri Gemelli, feed in particular upon a  large species of oyster, and fearful of inserting their paws between the  open valves, lest the oyster should close and crush them, they first  place a tolerably large stone within the shell, and then drag out their  victim with safety. The latter are no less ingenious. Dampier saw  several of them take up oysters from the beach, lay them on a stone, and  beat them with another till they demolished the shells. Wafer observed  the monkeys in the island of Gorgonia to proceed in a similar manner;  and those of the Cape of Good Hope, if we are to credit La Loubere,  perpetually amuse themselves by transporting shells from the shore to  the tops of mountains, with the intention undoubtedly of devouring them  at leisure. Even the fox, when pressed by hunger, will deign to eat  muscles and other bivalves; and the racoon, whose fur is esteemed by  hatters next in value to that of the beaver, when near the shore lives  much on them, more particularly on oysters. We are told that it will  watch the opening of the shells, dexterously put in its paw, and tear  out the contents. Not, however, without danger, for sometimes, we are  assured, by a sudden closure, the oyster will catch the thief, and  detain him until he is drowned by the return of the tide. The story,  I regret to say, appears somewhat apocryphal.    These are amusing facts; the following, to the epicure at least, may  be equally interesting. In some parts of England it is a prevalent and  probably a correct opinion, that the shelled-snails contribute much  to the fattening of their sheep. On the hill above Whitsand Bay in  Cornwall, and in the south of Devonshire, the _Bulimus acutus_ and  the _Helix virgata_, which are found there in vast profusion, are  considered to have this good effect; and it is indeed impossible that  the sheep can browse on the short grass of the places just mentioned,  without devouring a prodigious quantity of them, especially in the  night, or after rain, when the Bulimi and Helices ascend the stunted  blades. \"The sweetest mutton,\" says Borlase, \"is reckoned to be that  of the smallest sheep, which feed on the commons where the sands are  scarce covered with the green sod, and the grass exceedingly short; such  are the towens or sand hillocks in Piran Sand, Gwythien, Philac, and  Senangreen, near the Land's End, and elsewhere in like situations. From  these sands come forth snails of the turbinated kind, but of different  species, and all sizes from the adult to the smallest just from the egg;  these spread themselves over the plains early in the morning, and,  whilst they are in quest of their own food among the dews, yield a most  fattening nourishment to the sheep.\" (_Hist. of Cornwall_.)    Among birds the shell-fish have many enemies. Several of the duck and  gull tribes, as you might anticipate, derive at least a portion of their  subsistence from them. The pied oyster-catcher receives its name from  the circumstance of feeding on oysters and limpets, and its bill is so  well adapted to the purpose of forcing asunder the valves of the one,  and of raising the other from the rock, that \"the Author of Nature,\"  as Derham says, \"seems to have framed it purely for that use.\" Several  kinds of crows likewise prey upon shell-fish, and the manner in which  they force the strong hold of their victims is very remarkable. A friend  of Dr. Darwin's saw above a hundred crows on the northern coast of  Ireland, at once, preying upon muscles. Each crow took a muscle up in  the air twenty or forty yards high, and let it fall on the stones, and  thus broke the shell. Many authorities might be adduced in corroboration  of this statement. In Southern Africa so many of the Testacea are  consumed by these and other birds, as to have given rise to an opinion  that the marine shells found buried in the distant plains, or in the  sides of the mountains, have been carried there by their agency, and  not, as generally supposed, by eruptions of the sea. Mr. Barrow, who  is of this opinion, tells us, in confirmation of it, that \"there is  scarcely a sheltered cavern in the sides of the mountains that arise  immediately from the sea, where living shell-fish may not be found any  day of the year. Crows even, and vultures, as well as aquatic birds,  detach the shell-fish from the rocks, and mount with them into the air:  shells thus carried are said to be frequently found on the very summit  even of the Table Mountain. In one cavern at the point of Mussel Bay,\"  he adds, \"I disturbed some thousands of birds, and found as many  thousands of living shell-fish scattered on the surface of a heap of  shells, that for aught I know, would have filled as many thousand  wagons.\" The story, therefore, of the ancient philosopher whose bald  pate one of these unlucky birds mistook for a stone, and dropped a  shell upon it, thereby killing at once both, is not so tramontane as  to stumble all belief.

He had a large farm and many  people, both men and women, worked in his fields, and as it was about  the beginning of the barley harvest when the two women came to  Bethlehem, these fields presented a busy appearance.    Ruth wished to do something to help support herself and her  mother-in-law, so she begged Naomi to let her go into the fields and  glean after the reapers--that is, to gather up the barley that was left  after they had made up the sheaves--and Naomi told her that she might  go.    [Illustration: THE PRODIGAL SON.]    Ruth happened to choose the field of Boaz to work in, and when the  wealthy man came into the field and saw her, he said, \"The Lord bless  thee!\" but he did not know who she was.    As he went away he inquired of the head reaper about the young woman,  and afterward he said to Ruth: \"Go not to glean in another field, but  keep here close to my maidens.\" He also spoke to his young men about  her, telling them to be kind and courteous to her, and he bade her go  and drink of the water which they drew whenever she was thirsty.    When Ruth wondered at his kindness and asked him why he was so good to a  stranger, he told her that he had heard of her love for Naomi and her  unselfish devotion, and he said: \"The Lord reward thee, and a full  recompense be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings  thou art come to trust.\" He invited her also to sit with his reapers at  meal-time, and he waited upon her that she might have enough to eat and  drink.    When she had gone he commanded his young men to let her glean among the  sheaves and to drop some handfuls purposely for her, and not to find  fault with her or reprove her.    So Ruth worked in the field all day, and then beat out the barley which  she had gleaned and took it to the city to show Naomi, who was very  glad, indeed, and very thankful.    Naomi asked Ruth where she had gleaned, and when she had heard the whole  story, she told her that Boaz was a near relative and that it was well  for her to stay in his fields, as he had given her permission to do,  until the end of the harvest. So Ruth kept close to the maidens who  gleaned in the fields of Boaz until the end of both the barley and the  wheat harvests.    Then one night when Boaz was to have a winnowing of barley, Naomi told  Ruth to make herself ready, putting on her best clothing, and to go to  the winnowing and the feast and to ask Boaz what she should do.    The winnowing is the fanning out of the straws from the kernels after  the husks have been beaten off. A great many people helped about the  work, and a feast was prepared for them.    Ruth did as Naomi had told her to do. When she had informed Boaz that  she was a near relative he said, \"Blessed be thou of the Lord, my  daughter.\" Then he told her not to be afraid, but to bring the long veil  which she wore, and when she had brought it he poured a large quantity  of barley into it. She carried this to the city and gave it to her  mother-in-law, telling her what Boaz had said, and Naomi was comforted;  for she knew that Boaz would advise them wisely.    After this Boaz went to the city and consulted with the chief men and  those that were interested in the welfare of Naomi and Ruth, and when he  found that it would be wronging no one, he told the people that he was  going to take Ruth for his wife, and the people said, \"We are  witnesses.\" So Boaz married Ruth; but in her new position as the wife of  a very wealthy and influential man, this noble woman did not forget her  love for Naomi, whom she still tenderly cared for. When a little son  came to bless the union, Naomi rejoiced, for she felt almost as though  it was her own little son, and she named him Obed and delighted in  taking care of him.    When Obed became a man he married and had a son named Jesse, who in turn  became the father of David, the great king of Israel. Jesus Himself was  of the House of David, and so God's promise to His chosen people was  fulfilled.          MOSES.      Pharaoh, the King of Egypt, had made a law that every boy baby of the  Hebrew race should be killed, and there was great sorrow because of it.  But when Moses was born, his mother managed to hide him for three  months; then she made a cradle, or little ark, and putting him into it,  carried him down to a river and hid the cradle among the reeds there.    Soon after this, Pharaoh's daughter came with her maidens to the  river-side, and when she saw the beautiful child, she sent one of her  maidens to bring it to her.    She took the little boy to the palace and named him Moses, and he became  a great man among the Egyptians; he knew, however, that he belonged to  the Hebrew race, and when he saw how badly his own people were treated,  he tried to help them; but at last he was obliged to leave Egypt, and  became a shepherd, taking care of the flocks of a priest called Jethro.  He also married Jethro's daughter.    [Illustration: THE GOOD SAMARITAN.]    After a time, God spoke to Moses out of a burning bush, and told him  that he must go and rescue his people from the cruel Egyptians. Moses  thought he could not do this; but God promised to help him, and to show  him what he would be able to do with that help, God turned the rod which  Moses carried into a serpent. Then God told Moses to pick the serpent  up by the tail, and as he did so, it became a rod again. He showed him  another sign, also; but Moses was still afraid, because he could not  talk well and thought that Pharaoh would not listen to him. So God told  him to take his brother Aaron for a spokesman.    Moses and Aaron, therefore, went into Egypt, where they called together  the chief men among their own people, the Hebrews, or Israelites, and  told them what God had commanded. Moses also did the miracles which God  had given him power to do, and the people believed that God had sent  him.    After this Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and told him that it was the  Lord's command that he should let the Israelites go. Pharaoh knew  nothing about God, and became very angry, saying that Moses and Aaron  kept the people from their work by telling them such things; and he  treated the poor Israelites worse than before.    But Moses had faith in God; so he was able to perform before the king  the wonderful things that he had done before his own people; still,  Pharaoh would not let the children of Israel go.    Then Moses turned the waters of the rivers into blood; and after that he  caused large numbers of frogs to run over the land and through the  houses, doing great harm. He also brought locusts and other insects to  be a pest to the people, and caused many of the useful animals which  belonged to the Egyptians to grow sick and die, doing all these wonders  with the rod which God had given him. But Pharaoh would not listen to  him.    Then God commanded Moses again, and he brought other plagues upon the  Egyptians; but Pharaoh would not give up.    At last, however, God sent a still more terrible trouble; for the  first-born of every Egyptian family, and even the first-born among their  flocks, died; although the Israelites, who were constantly praying to  the Lord and making sacrifices, were spared, as they had been all the  time.    Then Pharaoh was frightened into obeying God, and he let the Israelites  go; so they started at once for the land of Canaan, and the Lord guided  them by a cloud, which at night looked like a pillar of fire.    When the Israelites had reached the Red Sea, they found that Pharaoh  was pursuing them with a large army. But God commanded Moses to stretch  forth his rod over the sea; he did so, and the waters parted, making a  high wall upon either side, so that the children of Israel passed  through and reached the other side in safety. Pharaoh and his hosts  followed and were all drowned.    When the children of Israel saw that they were safe, they sang a  beautiful song of praise to God, and then they went on their way again.    After they had traveled for some time, they were in need of bread and  meat, and they complained about Moses because he had brought them to a  land where they had not enough to eat. But God sent them plenty of  quails and also a substance which they could use for bread. Later, when  they wanted water, the Lord commanded Moses, and he struck a rock with  his rod, and pure water poured out of it, so that the thirsty people and  their animals had all that they wanted.    In this way God took care of them as they journeyed through the new and  strange country toward the promised land, and Moses became the law-giver  of the Israelites, receiving his commandments from God.          JACOB AND ESAU.      Jacob and Esau were twin brothers, sons of Isaac and Rebekah. Esau was  the dearer to his father; but Rebekah loved Jacob more, and she wished  her favorite son to have the birthright, or larger portion of the  property, which really belonged to Esau because he was a little the  older.    One day Esau came in from hunting, very tired and hungry, and sold his  birthright to Jacob for a kind of stew called pottage.    Afterward, when Isaac had grown very old, he sent Esau one day to get  some of his favorite meat, saying that when he returned he should have  his father's blessing.    But Rebekah heard this and determined that Jacob should have the  blessing instead. So she prepared meat, then dressed Jacob in some of  his brother's clothing, covering his hands and neck with the skin of the  kids, and sent him to his father; and Isaac blessed him, for his sight  was dim, and he thought it was Esau.    When the elder brother returned, he was very angry with Jacob, and Isaac  was deeply grieved to think he had been deceived; but he blessed Esau as  well, who became prosperous and had large possessions and great power.
