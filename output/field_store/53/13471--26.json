[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#2)"],[1,"Mirdath cried out something  in a strange low voice, and brought me to a halt, that she might face  me. And she questioned me very earnest; and I answered just so earnest  as she; for I was grown suddenly to an excitement, in that I perceived  she knew also. And, in verity, she told me that she had knowledge; but  had thought that she was alone in the world with her knowledge of that  strange land of her dreams; and now to find that I also had travelled in  those dear, strange dream lands. And truly the marvel of it--the marvel  of it! As she to say time and oft. And again, as we walked, she gave out  word that there was little wonder she had been urged to call to me that  night, as she saw me pause upon the road; though, indeed, she had  learned of our cousin-ship before, having seen me go by on my horse  pretty oft, and inquired concerning me; and mayhap daintily irked that I  had so little heed of Lady Mirdath the Beautiful. But, indeed, I had  thought of other matters; yet had been human enough, had I but met her  proper before I see her.    Now you must not think that I was not utter stirred by the wonder of  this thing, that we had both a dreamful knowledge of the same matters,  of which each had thought none other knew. Yet, when I questioned more,  there was much that had been in my fancies that was foreign to her, and  likewise much that had been familiar to her, that was of no meaning to  me. But though there was this, that brought a little regret to us, there  would be, time and again, some new thing that one told, that the other  knew and could finish the telling of, to the gladness and amazement of  both.    And so shall you picture us wandering and having constant speech, so  that, hour by hour, we grew gladly aged in dear knowledge and sweet  friendship of the other.    And truly, how the time passed, I know not; but there came presently a  hullabaloo, and the shouts of men's voices and the baying of dogs, and  the gleam of lanthorns, so that I knew not what to think; until, very  sudden, and with a sweet and strange little laughter, the Lady Mirdath  to perceive that we had missed the hours utter in our converse; so that  her Guardian (made uneasy because of the three foot-pads) had ordered a  search. And we all that time a-wander together in happy forgetfulness.    And we turned homeward, then, and came towards the lights; but indeed,  the dogs found us before we were come there; and they had grown to know  me now, and leaped about me, barking very friendly; and so in a minute  the men had discovered us, and were gone back to tell Sir Jarles that  all was well.    And this was the way of our meeting and the growing of our acquaintance,  and the beginning of my great love for Mirdath the Beautiful.    Now, from that time onward, evening by evening would I go a-wander along  the quiet and country road that led from my estate to the estate of Sir  Jarles. And always I went inward by the hedge-gap; and oft I should find  the Lady Mirdath walking in that part of the woods; but always with her  great boar-hounds about her; for I had begged that she do this thing for  her sweet safety; and she to seem wishful to pleasure me; but truly to  be just so oft utter perverse in diverse matters; and to strive to  plague me, as though she would discover how much I would endure and how  far she might go to anger me.    And, truly, well I remember how that one night, coming to the hedge-gap,  I saw two country-maids come thence out from the woods of Sir Jarles';  but they were naught to me, and I would have gone upward through the  gap, as ever; only that, as they passed me, they curtseyed somewhat  over-graceful for rough wenches. And I had a sudden thought, and came up  to them to see them more anigh; and truly I thought the taller was  surely the Lady Mirdath. But, indeed, I could not be sure; for when I  asked who she did be, she only to simper and to curtsey again; and so  was I very natural all in doubt; but yet sufficient in wonder (having  some knowledge of the Lady Mirdath) to follow the wenches, the which I  did.    And they then, very speedy and sedate, as though I were some rack-rape  that they did well to be feared of alone at night; and so came at last  to the village green, where a great dance was a-foot, with torches, and  a wandering fiddler to set the tune; and ale in plenty.    And the two to join the dance, and danced very hearty; but had only each  the other for a partner, and had a good care to avoid the torches. And  by this, I was pretty sure that they were truly the Lady Mirdath and her  maid; and so I took chance when they had danced somewhat my way, to step  over to them, and ask boldly for a dance. But, indeed, the tall one  answered, simpering, that she was promised; and immediately gave her  hand to a great hulking farmer-lout, and went round the green with him;  and well punished she was for her waywardness; for she had all her skill  to save her pretty feet from his loutish stampings; and very glad she  was to meet the end of the dance.    And I knew now for certainty that it was Mirdath the Beautiful, despite  her plan of disguise, and the darkness and the wench's dress and the  foot-gear that marred her step so great. And I walked across to her, and  named her, whispering, by name; and gave her plain word to be done of  this unwisdom, and I would take her home. But she to turn from me, and  she stamped her foot, and went again to the lout; and when she had  suffered another dance with him, she bid him be her escort a part of the  way; the which he was nothing loath of.    And another lad, that was mate to him, went likewise; and in a moment,  so soon as they were gone away from the light of the torches, the rough  hind-lads made to set their arms about the waists of the two wenches,  not wetting who they had for companions. And the Lady Mirdath was no  longer able to endure, and cried out in her sudden fear and disgust, and  struck the rough hind that embraced her, so hard that he loosed her a  moment, swearing great oaths. And directly he came back to her again,  and had her in a moment, to kiss her; and she, loathing him to the very  death, beat him madly in the face with her hands; but to no end, only  that I was close upon them. And, in that moment, she screamed my name  aloud; and I caught the poor lout and hit him once, but not to harm him  overmuch; yet to give him a long memory of me; and afterward I threw him  into the side of the road. But the second hind, having heard my name,  loosed from the tiring-maid, and ran for his life; and, indeed, my  strength was known all about that part.    And I caught Mirdath the Beautiful by her shoulders, and shook her very  soundly, in my anger. And afterward, I sent the maid onward; and she,  having no word from her Mistress to stay, went forward a little; and in  this fashion we came at last to the hedge-gap, with the Lady Mirdath  very hushed; but yet walking anigh to me, as that she had some secret  pleasure of my nearness. And I led her through the gap, and so homeward  to the Hall; and there bid her good-night at a side door that she held  the key of. And, truly, she bid me good-night in an utter quiet voice;  and was almost as that she had no haste to be gone from me that night.    Yet, when I met her on the morrow, she was full of a constant impudence  to me; so that, having her alone to myself, when the dusk was come, I  asked her why she would never be done of her waywardness; because that I  ached to have companionship of her; and, instead, she denied my need.  And, at that, she was at once very gentle; and full of a sweet and  winsome understanding; and surely knew that I wished to be rested; for  she brought out her harp, and played me dear olden melodies of our  childhood-days all that evening; and so had my love for her the more  intent and glad. And she saw me that night to the hedge-gap, having her  three great boar-hounds with her, to company her home again. But,  indeed, I followed her afterwards, very silent, until I saw her safe  into the Hall; for I would not have her alone in the night; though she  believed that I was then far away on the country road. And as she walked  with her dogs, one or another would run back to me, to nose against me  friendly-wise; but I sent them off again very quiet; and she had no  knowledge of aught; for she to go singing a love-song quietly all the  way home. But whether she loved me, I could not tell; though she had a  nice affection for me.    Now, on the following evening, I went somewhat early to the gap; and lo!  who should be standing in the gap, talking to the Lady Mirdath; but a  very clever-drest man, that had a look of the Court about him; and he,  when I approached, made no way for me through the gap; but stood firm,  and eyed me very insolent; so that I put out my hand, and lifted him  from my way.    And lo! the Lady Mirdath turned a bitterness of speech upon me that gave  me an utter pain and astonishment; so that I was assured in a moment  that she had no true love for me, or she had never striven so to put me  to shame before the stranger, and named me uncouth and brutal to a  smaller man. And, indeed, you shall perceive how I was in my heart in  that moment.    And I saw that there was some seeming of justice in what the Lady  Mirdath said; but yet might the man have shown a better spirit; and  moreover Mirdath the Beautiful had no true call to shame me, her true  friend and cousin, before this stranger. Yet did I not stop to argue;  but bowed very low to the Lady Mirdath; and afterward I bowed a little  to the man and made apology; for, indeed, he was neither great nor  strong-made; and I had been better man to have shown courtesy to him; at  least in the first.    And so, having done justice to my own respect, I turned and went on, and  left them to their happiness.    Now, I walked then, maybe twenty good miles, before I came to my own  home; for there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden. Part II.

Descend, ye hovering Sylphs! aerial Quires,          And sweep with little hands your silver lyres;          With fairy footsteps print your grassy rings,          Ye Gnomes! accordant to the tinkling strings;  5      While in soft notes I tune to oaten reed          Gay hopes, and amorous sorrows of the mead.--          From giant Oaks, that wave their branches dark,          To the dwarf Moss, that clings upon their bark,          What Beaux and Beauties crowd the gaudy groves,  10    And woo and win their vegetable Loves.          How Snowdrops cold, and blue-eyed Harebels blend          Their tender tears, as o'er the stream they bend;          The lovesick Violet, and the Primrose pale          Bow their sweet heads, and whisper to the gale;  15    With secret sighs the Virgin Lily droops,          And jealous Cowslips hang their tawny cups.          How the young Rose in beauty's damask pride          Drinks the warm blushes of his bashful bride;          With honey'd lips enamour'd Woodbines meet,  20    Clasp with fond arms, and mix their kisses sweet.--            Stay thy soft-murmuring waters, gentle Rill;          Hush, whispering Winds, ye ruflling Leaves, be still;          Rest, silver Butterflies, your quivering wings;          Alight, ye Beetles, from your airy rings;      [_Vegetable Loves_. l. 10. Linneus, the celebrated Swedish naturalist,  has demonstrated, that ail flowers contain families of males or females,  or both; and on their marriages has constructed his invaluable system of  Botany.]      25    Ye painted Moths, your gold-eyed plumage furl,          Bow your wide horns, your spiral trunks uncurl;          Glitter, ye Glow-worms, on your mossy beds;          Descend, ye Spiders, on your lengthen'd threads;          Slide here, ye horned Snails, with varnish'd shells;  30    Ye Bee-nymphs, listen in your waxen cells!--            BOTANIC MUSE! who in this latter age          Led by your airy hand the Swedish sage,          Bad his keen eye your secret haunts explore          On dewy dell, high wood, and winding shore;  35    Say on each leaf how tiny Graces dwell;          How laugh the Pleasures in a blossom's bell;          How insect Loves arise on cobweb wings,          Aim their light shafts, and point their little stings.

It is brought from between the tropics to our hot-houses,  and bears a beautiful crimson flower; the seeds are used as shot by the  Indians, and are strung for prayer-beads in some catholic countries.]              The virtuous pair, in milder regions born,          Dread the rude blast of Autumn's icy morn;          Round the chill fair he folds his crimson vest,          And clasps the timorous beauty to his breast.    45    Thy love, CALLITRICHE, _two_ Virgins share,          Smit with thy starry eye and radiant hair;--          On the green margin sits the youth, and laves          His floating train of tresses in the waves;          Sees his fair features paint the streams that pass,  50    And bends for ever o'er the watery glass.            _Two_ brother swains, of COLLIN'S gentle name,          The same their features, and their forms the same,      [_Callitriche_, l. 45. Fine-Hair, Stargrass. One male and two females  inhabit each flower. The upper leaves grow in form of a star, whence it  is called Stellaria Aquatica by Ray and others; its stems and leaves  float far on the water, and are often so matted together, as to bear a  person walking on them. The male sometimes lives in a separate flower.]    [_Collinsonia_. l. 51. Two males one female. I have lately observed a  very singular circumstance in this flower; the two males stand widely  diverging from each other, and the female bends herself into contact  first with one of them, and after some time leaves this, and applies  herself to the other. It is probable one of the anthers may be mature  before  the other? See note on Gloriosa, and Genista. The  females in Nigella, devil in the bush, are very tall compared to the  males; and bending over in a circle to them, give the flower some  resemblance to a regal crown. The female of the epilobium angustisolium,  rose bay willow herb, bends down amongst the males for several days,  and becomes upright again when impregnated.]    [_Genista_. l. 57. Dyer's broom. Ten males and one female inhabit this  flower. The males are generally united at the bottom in two sets, whence  Linneus has named the class \"two brotherhoods.\" In the Genista, however,  they are united in but one set. The flowers of this class are called  papilionaceous, from their resemblance to a butterfly, as the pea-blossom.  In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately observed  a curious circumstance, the males or stamens are in two sets, one set  rising a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper set does not arrive  at their maturity so soon as the lower, and the stigma, or head of the  female, is produced amongst the upper or immature set; but as soon as  the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keel-leaf, or hood of the  flower, it bends itself round in an instant, like a French horn, and  inserts its head, or stigma, amongst the lower or mature set of males.  The pistil, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days  the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set, by the time they become  mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the  keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously. See  note on Collinsonia, Gloriosa, Draba.]              With rival love for fair COLLINIA sigh,          Knit the dark brow, and roll the unsteady eye.  55    With sweet concern the pitying beauty mourns,          And sooths with smiles the jealous pair by turns.            Sweet blooms GENISTA in the myrtle shade,          And _ten_ fond brothers woo the haughty maid.          _Two_ knights before thy fragrant altar bend,  60    Adored MELISSA! and _two_ squires attend.          MEADIA'S soft chains _five_ suppliant beaux confess,          And hand in hand the laughing belle address;          Alike to all, she bows with wanton air,          Rolls her dark eye, and waves her golden hair.      [_Melissa_. l. 60. Balm. In each flower there are four males and one  female; two of the males stand higher than the other two; whence the name  of the class \"two powers.\" I have observed in the Ballota, and others of  this class, that the two lower stamens, or males become mature before the  two higher. After they have shed their dust, they turn themselves away  outwards; and the pistil, or female, continuing to grow a little taller,  is applied to the upper stamens. See Gloriosa, and Genista.    All the plants of this class, which have naked seeds, are aromatic. The  Marum, and Nepeta are particularly delightful to cats; no other brute  animals seem pleased with any odours but those of their food or prey.]    [_Meadia_. l. 61. Dodecatheon, American Cowslip. Five males and one  female. The males, or anthers, touch each other. The uncommon beauty of  this flower occasioned Linneus to give it a name signifying the twelve  heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The pistil is  much longer than the stamens, hence the flower-stalks have their elegant  bend, that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust  of the anthers. And the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent  the rain or dew drops from sliding down and washing off this dust  prematurely; and at the same time exposing it to the light and air. As  soon as the seeds are formed, it erects all the flower-stalks to prevent  them from falling out; and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this  a mechanical effect, or does it indicate a"]]]
