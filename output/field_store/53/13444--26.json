He had  or he had not. It was mixed with the pomegranate or the quince that Eve had  sliced and cooked on the day before.    A dinner at its best is brought to a single focus. There is one dish  to dominate the cloth, a single bulk to which all other dishes are  subordinate. If there be turkey, it should mount from a central platter.  Its protruding legs out-top the candles. All other foods are, as it were,  privates in Caesar's army. They do no more than flank the pageant. Nor may  the pantry hold too many secrets. Within reason, everything should be  set out at once, or at least a gossip of its coming should run before.  Otherwise, if the stew is savory, how shall one reserve a corner for the  custard? One must partition himself justly--else, by an over-stowage at the  end, he list and sink.    I am partial to picnics--the spreading of the cloth in the woods or beside  a stream--although I am not avid for sandwiches unless hunger press me.  Rather, let there be a skillet in the company and let a fire be started!  Nor need a picnic consume the day. In summer it requires but the late  afternoon, with such borrowing of the night as is necessary for the  journey home. You leave the street car, clanking with your bundles like an  itinerant tinman. You follow a stream, which on these lower stretches, it  is sad to say, is already infected with the vices of the city. Like many a  countryman who has come to town, it has fallen to dissipation. It shows the  marks of the bottle. Further up, its course is cleaner. You cross it in the  mud. Was it not Christian who fell into the bog because of the burden on  his back? Then you climb a villainously long hill and pop out upon an open  platform above the city.    The height commands a prospect to the west. Below is the smoke of a  thousand suppers. Up from the city there comes the hum of life, now  somewhat fallen with the traffic of the day--as though Nature already  practiced the tune for sending her creatures off to sleep. You light a  fire. The baskets disgorge their secrets. Ants and other leviathans think  evidently that a circus has come or that bears are in the town. The chops  and bacon achieve their appointed destiny. You throw the last bone across  your shoulder. It slips and rattles to the river. The sun sets. Night like  an ancient dame puts on her jewels:      And now that I have climbed and won this height,    I must tread downward through the sloping shade    And travel the bewildered tracks till night.    Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed    And see the gold air and the silver fade    And the last bird fly into the last light.    By these confessions you will see how unfit I am to comment on the old cook  book of Sir Kenelm Digby. Yet it lies before me. It may have escaped your  memory in the din of other things, that in the time when Oliver Cromwell  still walked the earth, there lived in England a man by the name of Kenelm  Digby, who was renowned in astrology and alchemy, piracy, wit, philosophy  and fashion. It appears that wherever learning wagged its bulbous head, Sir  Kenelm was of the company. It appears, also, that wherever the mahogany did  most groan, wherever the possets were spiced most delicately to the nose,  there too did Sir Kenelm bib and tuck himself. With profundity, as  though he sucked wisdom from its lowest depth, he spouted forth on the  transmutation of the baser metals or tossed you a phrase from Paracelsus.  Or with long instructive finger he dissertated on the celestial universe.  One would have thought that he had stood by on the making of it and that  his judgment had prevailed in the larger problems. Yet he did not neglect  his trencher.    And now as time went on, the richness of the food did somewhat dominate his  person. The girth of his wisdom grew no less, but his body fattened. In  a word, the good gentleman's palate came to vie with his intellect. Less  often was he engaged upon some dark saying of Isidore of Seville. Rather,  even if his favorite topic astrology were uppermost about the table, his  eye travelled to the pantry on every change of dishes. His fingers, too,  came to curl most delicately on his fork. He used it like an epicure,  poking his viands apart for sharpest scrutiny. His nod upon a compote was  much esteemed.    Now mark his further decline! On an occasion--surely the old rascal's head  is turned!--he would be found in private talk with his hostess, the Lady of  Middlesex, or with the Countess of Monmouth, not as you might expect, on  the properties of fire or on the mortal diseases of man, but--on subjects  quite removed. Society, we may be sure, began to whisper of these snug  parleys in the arbor after dinner, these shadowed mumblings on the balcony  when the moon was up--and Lady Digby stiffened into watchfulness. It was  when they took leave that she saw the Countess slip a note into her lord's  fingers. Her jealousy broke out. \"Viper!\" She spat the words and seized her  husband's wrist. Of course the note was read. It proved, however, that Sir  Kenelm was innocent of all mischief. To the disappointment of the gossips,  who were tuned to a spicier anticipation, the note was no more than a  recipe of the manner that the Countess was used to mix her syllabub, with  instruction that it was the \"rosemary a little bruised and the limon-peal  that did quicken the taste.\" Advice, also, followed in the postscript on  the making of tea, with counsel that \"the boiling water should remain upon  it just so long as one might say a _miserere_.\" A mutual innocence being  now established, the Lady Digby did by way of apology peck the Countess on  the cheek.    Sir Kenelm died in 1665, full of years. In that day his fame rested chiefly  on his books in physic and chirurgery. His most enduring work was still to  be published--\"The Closet Opened.\"    It was two years after his death that his son came upon a bundle of his  father's papers that had hitherto been overlooked. I fancy that he went  spying in the attic on a rainy day. In the darkest corner, behind the  rocking horse--if such devices were known in those distant days--he came  upon a trunk of his father's papers. \"Od's fish,\" said Sir Kenelm's son,  \"here's a box of manuscripts. It is like that they pertain to alchemy or  chirurgery.\" He pulled out a bundle and held it to the light--such light as  came through the cobwebs of the ancient windows. \"Here be strange matters,\"  he exclaimed. Then he read aloud: \"My Lord of Bristol's Scotch collops are  thus made: Take a leg of fine sweet mutton, that to make it tender, is  kept as long as possible may be without stinking. In winter seven or eight  days\"--\"Ho! Ho!\" cried Sir Kenelm's son. \"This is not alchemy!\" He drew out  another parchment and read again: \"My Lord of Carlile's sack posset, how  it's made: Take a pottle of cream and boil in it a little whole cinnamon  and three or four flakes of mace. Boil it until it simpreth and bubbleth.\"    By this time, as you may well imagine, Sir Kenelm's son was wrought to an  excitement. It is likely that he inherited his father's palate and that the  juices of his appetite were stirred. Seizing an armful of the papers, he  leaped down the attic steps, three at a time. His lady mother thrust a  curled and papered head from her door and asked whether the chimney were  afire, but he did not heed her. The cook was waddling in her pattens. He  cried to her to throw wood upon the fire.    That night the Digby household was served a delicacy, red herrings broiled  in the fashion of my Lord d'Aubigny, \"short and crisp and laid upon a  sallet.\" Also, there was a wheaten flommery as it was made in the West  Country--for the cook chose quite at random--and a slip-coat cheese as  Master Phillips proportioned it. Also, against the colic, which was  ravishing the country, the cook prepared a metheglin as Lady Stuart mixed  it--\"nettles, fennel and grumel seeds, of each two ounces being small-cut  and mixed with honey and boiled together.\" It is on record that the Lady  Digby smiled for the first time since her lord had died, and when the  grinning cook bore in the platter, she beat upon the table with her spoon.    The following morning, Sir Kenelm's son posted to London bearing the  recipes, with a pistol in the pocket of his great coat against the crossing  of Hounslow Heath. He went to a printer at the Star in Little Britain whose  name was H. Brome.    Shortly the book appeared. It was the son who wrote the preface: \"There  needs no Rhetoricating Floscules to set it off. The Authour, as is well  known, having been a Person of Eminency for his Learning, and of Exquisite  Curiosity in his Researches. Even that Incomparable Sir Kenelme Digbie  Knight, Fellow of the Royal Society and Chancellour to the Queen Mother,  (Et omen in Nomine) His name does sufficiently Auspicate the Work.\" The  sale of the book is not recorded. It is supposed that the Lady Middlesex,  so many of whose recipes had been used, directed that her chair be carried  to the shop where the book was for sale and that she bought largely of it.  The Countess of Dorset bought a copy and spelled it out word for word to  her cook. As for the Lady Monmouth, she bought not a single copy, which  neglect on coming to the Digbys aroused a coolness.    To this day it is likely that a last auspicated volume still sits on its  shelf with the spice jars in some English country kitchen and that a worn  and toothless cook still thumbs its leaves. If the guests about the table  be of an antique mind, still will they pledge one another with its honeyed  drinks, still will they pipe and whistle of its virtues, still will they--    \"EAT\"--A flaring sign hangs above the sidewalk.
