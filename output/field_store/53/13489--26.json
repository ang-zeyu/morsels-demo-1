The time was, and that not so very long ago, when it was contended by some  that there are tribes of men without any sort of religion; nowadays the  effort is to show that the feeling which prompts to it is common, even  among brutes.    This change of opinion has come about partly through an extension of the  definition of religion. It is now held to mean any kind of belief in  spiritual or extra-natural agencies. Some learned men say that we had  better drop the word \"religion,\" lest we be misunderstood. They would  rather use \"daimonism,\" or \"supernaturalism,\" or other such new term; but  none of these seems to me so wide and so exactly significant of what I  mean as \"religion.\"    All now agree that in this very broad sense some kind of religion exists  in every human community.[1]    [Footnote 1: I suppose I am not going too far in saying \"all agree;\" for I  think that the latest study of this subject, by Gustav Roskoff, disposes  of Sir John Lubbock's doubts, as well as the crude statements of the  author of _Kraft und Stoff_, and such like compilations. Gustav Roskoff,  _Das Religionswesen der Rohesten Naturvoelker_, Leipzig, 1880.]    The attempt has often been made to classify these various faiths under  some few general headings. The scheme of Auguste Comte still has  supporters. He taught that man begins with fetichism, advances to  polytheism, and at last rises to monotheism. More in vogue at present is  the theory that the simplest and lowest form of religion is individual;  above it are the national religions; and at the summit the universal or  world religions.    Comte's scheme has not borne examination. It is artificial and sterile.  Look at Christianity. It is the highest of all religions, but it is not  monotheism. Look at Buddhism. In its pure form it is not even theism. The  second classification is more fruitful for historical purposes.    The psychologist, however, inquires as to the essence, the real purpose of  religions. This has been differently defined by the two great schools of  thought.    All religions, says the idealist, are the efforts, poor or noble,  conscious or blind, to develop the Idea of God in the soul of man.    No, replies the rationalist, it is simply the effort of the human mind to  frame a Theory of Things; at first, religion is an early system of natural  philosophy; later it becomes moral philosophy. Explain the Universe by  physical laws, point out that the origin and aim of ethics are the  relations of men, and we shall have no more religions, nor need any.    The first answer is too intangible, the second too narrow. The rude savage  does not philosophize on phenomena; the enlightened student sees in them  but interacting forces: yet both may be profoundly religious. Nor can  morality be accepted as a criterion of religions. The bloody scenes in the  Mexican teocalli were merciful compared with those in the torture rooms of  the Inquisition. Yet the religion of Jesus was far above that of  Huitzilopochtli.    What I think is the essence, the principle of vitality, in religion, and  in all religions, is _their supposed control over the destiny of the  individual_, his weal or woe, his good or bad hap, here or hereafter, as  it may be. Rooted infinitely deep in the sense of personality, religion  was recognized at the beginning, it will be recognized at the end, as the  one indestructible ally in the struggle for individual existence. At  heart, all prayers are for preservation, the burden of all litanies is a  begging for Life.    This end, these benefits, have been sought by the cults of the world  through one of two theories.    The one, that which characterizes the earliest and the crudest religions,  teaches that man escapes dangers and secures safety by the performance or  avoidance of certain actions. He may credit this or that myth, he may hold  to one or many gods; this is unimportant; but he must not fail in the  penance or the sacred dance, he must not touch that which is _taboo_, or  he is in peril. The life of these cults is the Deed, their expression is  the Rite.    Higher religions discern the inefficacy of the mere Act. They rest their  claim on Belief. They establish dogmas, the mental acceptance of which is  the one thing needful. In them mythology passes into theology; the act is  measured by its motive, the formula by the faith back of it. Their life is  the Creed.    The Myth finds vigorous and congenial growth only in the first of these  forms. There alone the imagination of the votary is free, there alone it  is not fettered by a symbol already defined.    To the student of religions the interest of the Myth is not that of an  infantile attempt to philosophize, but as it illustrates the intimate and  immediate relations which the religion in which it grew bore to the  individual life. Thus examined, it reveals the inevitable destinies of men  and of nations as bound up with their forms of worship.    These general considerations appear to me to be needed for the proper  understanding of the study I am about to make. It concerns itself with  some of the religions which were developed on the American continent  before its discovery. My object is to present from them a series of myths  curiously similar in features, and to see if one simple and general  explanation of them can be found.    The processes of myth-building among American tribes were much the same as  elsewhere. These are now too generally familiar to need specification  here, beyond a few which I have found particularly noticeable.    At the foundation of all myths lies the mental process of  _personification_, which finds expression in the rhetorical figure of  _prosopopeia_. The definition of this, however, must be extended from the  mere representation of inanimate things as animate, to include also the  representation of irrational beings as rational, as in the \"animal myths,\"  a most common form of religious story among primitive people.    Some languages favor these forms of personification much more than others,  and most of the American languages do so in a marked manner, by the broad  grammatical distinctions they draw between animate and inanimate objects,  which distinctions must invariably be observed. They cannot say \"the boat  moves\" without specifying whether the boat is an animate object or not, or  whether it is to be considered animate, for rhetorical purposes, at the  time of speaking.    The sounds of words have aided greatly in myth building. Names and words  which are somewhat alike in sound, _paronyms_, as they are called by  grammarians, may be taken or mistaken one for the other. Again, many myths  spring from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#2)"],[1,"with my  relatives to lighten the dreariness of suspense; at last, about the  middle of June, the Count came, and shortly afterwards we found a  vessel--a Danish brig, the \"Caroline,\" Captain Bock, bound for Rio  Janeiro.    I had now before me a long voyage, which could not be made under two  months at the least, and which, possibly, might last three or four.  Luckily I had already lived for a considerable period on board  sailing vessels during my former travels, and was therefore  acquainted with their arrangements, which are very different from  those of steamers.  On board a steamer everything is agreeable and  luxurious; the vessel pursues her rapid course independent of the  wind, and the passengers enjoy good and fresh provisions, spacious  cabins, and excellent society.    In sailing vessels all this is very different, as, with the  exception of the large East Indiamen, they are not fitted up for  passengers.  In them the cargo is looked upon as the principal  thing, and in the eyes of the crew passengers are a troublesome  addition, whose comfort is generally very little studied.  The  captain is the only person who takes any interest in them, since a  third or even the half of the passage-money falls to his share.    The space, too, is so confined, that you can hardly turn yourself  round in the sleeping cabins, while it is quite impossible to stand  upright in the berths.  Besides this, the motion of a sailing vessel  is much stronger than that of a steamer; on the latter, however,  many affirm that the eternal vibration, and the disagreeable odour  of the oil and coals, are totally insupportable.  For my own part, I  never found this to be the case; it certainly is unpleasant, but  much easier to bear than the many inconveniences always existing on  board a sailing vessel.  The passenger is there a complete slave to  every whim or caprice of the captain, who is an absolute sovereign  and holds uncontrolled sway over everything.  Even the food depends  upon his generosity, and although it is generally not absolutely  bad, in the best instances, it is not equal to that on board a  steamer.    The following form the ordinary diet:  tea and coffee without milk,  bacon and junk, soup made with pease or cabbage, potatoes, hard  dumplings, salted cod, and ship-biscuit.  On rare occasions, ham,  eggs, fish, pancakes, or even skinny fowls, are served out.  It is  very seldom, in small ships, that bread can be procured.    To render the living more palatable, especially on a long voyage,  passengers would do well to take with them a few additions to the  ship's fare.  The most suitable are:  portable soup and captain's  biscuit--both of which should be kept in tin canisters to preserve  them from mouldiness and insects--a good quantity of eggs, which,  when the vessel is bound for a southern climate, should first be  dipped in strong lime-water or packed in coal-dust; rice, potatoes,  sugar, butter, and all the ingredients for making sangaree and  potato-salad, the former being very strengthening and the latter  very cooling.  I would strongly recommend those who have children  with them to take a goat as well.    As regards wine, passengers should take especial care to ask the  captain whether this is included in the passage-money, otherwise it  will have to be purchased from him at a very high rate.    There are also other objects which must not be forgotten, and above  all a mattress, bolster, and counterpane, as the berths are  generally unfurnished.  These can be purchased very cheaply in any  seaport town.    Besides this, it is likewise advisable to take a stock of coloured  linen.  The office of washerwoman is filled by a sailor, so that it  may easily be imagined that the linen does not return from the wash  in the best possible condition.    When the sailors are employed in shifting the sails, great care must  be taken to avoid injury by the falling of any of the ropes.  But  all these inconveniences are comparatively trifling; the greatest  amount of annoyance begins towards the end of the voyage.  The  captain's mistress is his ship.  At sea he allows her to wear an  easy neglige, but in port she must appear in full dress.  Not a sign  of the long voyage, of the storms, of the glowing heat she has  suffered, must be visible.  Then begins an incessant hammering,  planing, and sawing; every flaw, every crack or injury is made good,  and, to wind up, the whole vessel is painted afresh.  The worst of  all, however, is the hammering when the cracks in the deck are being  repaired and filled up with pitch.  This is almost unbearable.    But enough of annoyances.  I have described them merely to prepare,  in some degree, those who have never been to sea.  Persons residing  in sea-port towns do not, perhaps, stand in need of this, for they  hear these matters mentioned every day; but such is not the case  with us poor souls, who have lived all our lives in inland cities.  Very often we hardly know how a steamer or a sailing vessel looks,  much less the mode of life on board them.  I speak from experience,  and know too well what I myself suffered on my first voyage, simply  because, not having been warned beforehand, I took nothing with me  save a small stock of linen and clothes.    At present I will proceed with the progress of my voyage.  We  embarked on the evening of the 28th of June, and weighed anchor  before daybreak of the 29th.  The voyage did not commence in any  very encouraging manner; we had very little, in fact almost no wind  at all, and compared to us every pedestrian appeared to be running a  race:  we made the nine miles to Blankenese in seven hours.    Luckily the slow rate at which we proceeded was not so disagreeable,  as, at first, for a considerable period we beheld the magnificent  port, and afterwards could admire, on the Holstein side, the  beautiful country houses of the rich Hamburghers, situated upon  charming eminences and surrounded by lovely gardens.  The opposite  side, belonging to Hanover, is as flat and monotonous as the other  is beautiful.  About here the Elbe, in many places, is from three to  four miles broad.    Before reaching Blankenese the ships take in their stock of water  from the Elbe.  This water, although of a dirty and thick  appearance, is said to possess the valuable quality of resisting  putridity for years.    We did not reach Gluckstadt (37 miles from Hamburgh) before the  morning of the 30th.  As there was not now a breath of wind, we were  entirely at the mercy of the stream, and began drifting back.  The  captain, therefore, ordered the men to cast anchor, and profited by  the leisure thus forced upon him to have the chests and boxes made  fast on the deck and in the hold.  We idlers had permission granted  us to land and visit the town, in which, however, we found but  little to admire.    There were eight passengers on board.  The four cabin places were  taken by Count B--, myself, and two young people who hoped to make  their fortune sooner in the Brazils than in Europe.  The price of a  passage in the first cabin was 100 dollars (20 pounds 16s. 8d.), and  in the steerage 50 dollars (10 pounds 8s. 4d.).    In the steerage, besides two worthy tradesmen, was a poor old woman  who was going, in compliance with the wish of her only son, who had  settled in the Brazils, to join him there, and a married woman whose  husband had been working as a tailor for the last six years in Rio  Janeiro.  People soon become acquainted on board ship, and generally  endeavour to agree as well as possible, in order to render the  monotony of a long voyage at all supportable.    On the 1st of July we again set sail in rather stormy weather.  We  made a few miles, but were soon obliged to cast anchor once more.  The Elbe is here so wide, that we could hardly see its banks, and  the swell so strong, that sea-sickness began to manifest itself  among our company.  On the 2nd of July, we again attempted to weigh  anchor, but with no better success than the day before.  Towards  evening we saw some dolphins, called also _tummler_, or tumblers, as  well as several gulls, which announced to us that we were fast  nearing the sea.    A great many vessels passed quickly by us.  Ah! they could turn to  account the storm and wind which swelled out their sails, and drove  them rapidly towards the neighbouring port.  We grudged them their  good fortune; and perhaps we had to thank this specimen of Christian  love on our part, that on the 3rd of July, we had not got further  than Cuxhaven, seventy-four miles from Hamburgh.    The 4th of July was a beautifully fine day, for those who could  remain quietly on shore; but for those on board ship it was bad  enough, as there was not the slightest breath of wind stirring.  To  get rid of our lamentations, the captain launched out in praises of  the charming little town, and had us conveyed to land.  We visited  the town, as well as the bathing establishment and the lighthouse,  and afterwards actually proceeded as far as a place called the  \"Bush,\" where, as we were told, we should find a great abundance of  strawberries.  After wandering about, over fields and meadows, for a  good hour in the glowing heat, we found the Bush, it is true, but  instead of strawberries, discovered only frogs and adders there.    We now proceeded into the scanty wood, where we saw about twenty  tents erected.  A bustling landlord came up, and offering us some  glasses of bad milk, said that every year a fair is held in the Bush  for three weeks, or rather, on three successive Sundays, for during  the week days the booths are closed.  The landlady also came  tripping towards us, and invited us, in a very friendly manner, to  spend the next Sunday with them.  She assured us that we should  \"amuse ourselves charmingly;\" that we elder members of the company  should find entertainment in the wonderful performances of the  tumblers and jugglers, and the"]]]
