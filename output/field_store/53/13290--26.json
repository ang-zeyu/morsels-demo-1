Then we went through the Avenue--that stretch of road under the  apple trees that Anne Shirley, over at Avonlea, calls \"The White  Way of Delight.\" It was almost dark here; and yet I could see  Hester's face just as plainly as if the moon were shining on it;  and whenever I looked at her she was always looking at me with  that strangely gentle smile on her lips.    Just as we passed out of the Avenue, James Trent overtook us,  driving.  It seems to me that our feelings at a given moment are  seldom what we would expect them to be.  I simply felt annoyed  that James Trent, the most notorious gossip in Newbridge, should  have seen me walking with Hester.  In a flash I anticipated all  the annoyance of it; he would talk of the matter far and wide.    But James Trent merely nodded and called out,    \"Howdy, Miss Margaret.  Taking a moonlight stroll by yourself?  Lovely night, ain't it?\"    Just then his horse suddenly swerved, as if startled, and broke  into a gallop.  They whirled around the curve of the road in an  instant.  I felt relieved, but puzzled.  JAMES TRENT HAD NOT SEEN  HESTER.    Down over the hill was Hugh Blair's place.  When we came to it,  Hester turned in at the gate.  Then, for the first time, I  understood why she had come back, and a blinding flash of joy  broke over my soul.  I stopped and looked at her.  Her deep eyes  gazed into mine, but she did not speak.    We went on. Hugh's house lay before us in the moonlight, grown  over by a tangle of vines.  His garden was on our right, a quaint  spot, full of old-fashioned flowers growing in a sort of  disorderly sweetness.  I trod on a bed of mint, and the spice of  it floated up to me like the incense of some strange, sacred,  solemn ceremonial.  I felt unspeakably happy and blessed.    When we came to the door Hester said,    \"Knock, Margaret.\"    I rapped gently.  In a moment, Hugh opened it.  Then that  happened by which, in after days, I was to know that this strange  thing was no dream or fancy of mine.  Hugh looked not at me, but  past me.    \"Hester!\" he exclaimed, with human fear and horror in his voice.    He leaned against the door-post, the big, strong fellow,  trembling from head to foot.    \"I have learned,\" said Hester, \"that nothing matters in all God's  universe, except love.  There is no pride where I have been, and  no false ideals.\"    Hugh and I looked into each other's eyes, wondering, and then we  knew that we were alone.        VIII. THE LITTLE BROWN BOOK OF MISS EMILY    The first summer Mr. Irving and Miss Lavendar--Diana and I could  never call her anything else, even after she was married--were at  Echo Lodge after their marriage, both Diana and I spent a great  deal of time with them.  We became acquainted with many of the  Grafton people whom we had not known before, and among others,  the family of Mr. Mack Leith.  We often went up to the Leiths in  the evening to play croquet.  Millie and Margaret Leith were very  nice girls, and the boys were nice, too.  Indeed, we liked every  one in the family, except poor old Miss Emily Leith.  We tried  hard enough to like her, because she seemed to like Diana and me  very much, and always wanted to sit with us and talk to us, when  we would much rather have been somewhere else.  We often felt a  good deal of impatience at these times, but I am very glad to  think now that we never showed it.    In a way, we felt sorry for Miss Emily.  She was Mr. Leith's  old-maid sister and she was not of much importance in the  household.  But, though we felt sorry for her, we couldn't like  her.  She really was fussy and meddlesome; she liked to poke a  finger into every one's pie, and she was not at all tactful.  Then, too, she had a sarcastic tongue, and seemed to feel bitter  towards all the young folks and their love affairs.  Diana and I  thought this was because she had never had a lover of her own.    Somehow, it seemed impossible to think of lovers in connection  with Miss Emily.  She was short and stout and pudgy, with a face  so round and fat and red that it seemed quite featureless; and  her hair was scanty and gray.  She walked with a waddle, just  like Mrs. Rachel Lynde, and she was always rather short of  breath.  It was hard to believe Miss Emily had ever been young;  yet old Mr. Murray, who lived next door to the Leiths, not only  expected us to believe it, but assured us that she had been very  pretty.    \"THAT, at least, is impossible,\" said Diana to me.    And then, one day, Miss Emily died.  I'm afraid no one was very  sorry.  It seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the  world and leave not one person behind to be sorry because you  have gone.  Miss Emily was dead and buried before Diana and I  heard of it at all.  The first I knew of it was when I came home  from Orchard Slope one day and found a queer, shabby little black  horsehair trunk, all studded with brass nails, on the floor of my  room at Green Gables.  Marilla told me that Jack Leith had  brought it over, and said that it had belonged to Miss Emily and  that, when she was dying, she asked them to send it to me.    \"But what is in it?  And what am I to do with it?\" I asked in  bewilderment.    \"There was nothing said about what you were to do with it.  Jack  said they didn't know what was in it, and hadn't looked into it,  seeing that it was your property.  It seems a rather queer  proceeding--but you're always getting mixed up in queer  proceedings, Anne.  As for what is in it, the easiest way to find  out, I reckon, is to open it and see.  The key is tied to it.  Jack said Miss Emily said she wanted you to have it because she  loved you and saw her lost youth in you.  I guess she was a bit  delirious at the last and wandered a good deal.  She said she  wanted you 'to understand her.'\"    I ran over to Orchard Slope and asked Diana to come over and  examine the trunk with me.  I hadn't received any instructions  about keeping its contents secret and I knew Miss Emily wouldn't  mind Diana knowing about them, whatever they were.    It was a cool, gray afternoon and we got back to Green Gables  just as the rain was beginning to fall.  When we went up to my  room the wind was rising and whistling through the boughs of the  big old Snow Queen outside of my window.  Diana was excited, and,  I really believe, a little bit frightened.    We opened the old trunk.  It was very small, and there was  nothing in it but a big cardboard box.  The box was tied up and  the knots sealed with wax.  We lifted it out and untied it.  I  touched Diana's fingers as we did it, and both of us exclaimed at  once, \"How cold your hand is!\"    In the box was a quaint, pretty, old-fashioned gown, not at all  faded, made of blue muslin, with a little darker blue flower in  it.  Under it we found a sash, a yellowed feather fan, and an  envelope full of withered flowers.  At the bottom of the box was  a little brown book.    It was small and thin, like a girl's exercise book, with leaves  that had once been blue and pink, but were now quite faded, and  stained in places.  On the fly leaf was written, in a very  delicate hand, \"Emily Margaret Leith,\" and the same writing  covered the first few pages of the book.  The rest were not  written on at all.  We sat there on the floor, Diana and I, and  read the little book together, while the rain thudded against the  window panes.                                                       June 19, 18--        I came to-day to spend a while with Aunt Margaret in      Charlottetown.  It is so pretty here, where she lives--and      ever so much nicer than on the farm at home.  I have no cows      to milk here or pigs to feed.  Aunt Margaret has given me      such a lovely blue muslin dress, and I am to have it made to      wear at a garden party out at Brighton next week.  I never      had a muslin dress before--nothing but ugly prints and dark      woolens.  I wish we were rich, like Aunt Margaret.  Aunt      Margaret laughed when I said this, and declared she would      give all her wealth for my youth and beauty and      light-heartedness.  I am only eighteen and I know I am very      merry but I wonder if I am really pretty.  It seems to me      that I am when I look in Aunt Margaret's beautiful mirrors.      They make me look very different from the old cracked one in      my room at home which always twisted my face and turned me      green.  But Aunt Margaret spoiled her compliment by telling      me I look exactly as she did at my age.  If I thought I'd      ever look as Aunt Margaret does now, I don't know what I'd      do.  She is so fat and red.                                                            June 29.        Last week I went to the garden party and I met a young man      called Paul Osborne.  He is a young artist from Montreal who      is boarding over at Heppoch.  He is the handsomest man I have      ever seen--very tall and slender, with dreamy, dark eyes and      a pale, clever face.  I have not been able to keep from      thinking about him ever since, and to-day he came over here      and asked if he could paint me.  I felt very much flattered      and so pleased when Aunt Margaret gave him permission.  He      says he wants to paint me as \"Spring,\" standing under the      poplars where a fine rain of sunshine falls through.  I am to      wear my blue muslin gown and a wreath of flowers on my hair.      He says I have such beautiful hair.  He has never seen any of      such a real pale gold.  Somehow it seems even prettier than      ever to me since he praised it.        I had a letter from home to-day.  Ma says the blue hen stole      her nest and came off with fourteen chickens, and that pa has      sold the little spotted calf.  Somehow those things don't      interest me like they once did.                                                             July 9.        The picture is coming on very well, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#19)"],[1,"she told you would  be the truth and nothing more or less than the truth.    \"Our father was a very proud man. Oh, Master, if Margaret was too proud  she got it from no stranger. And her misfortune cut him to the heart. He  never spoke a word to us here for more than three days after he heard of  it. He sat in the corner there with bowed head and would not touch bite  or sup. He had not been very willing for her to marry Ronald Fraser; and  when she came home in disgrace she had not set foot over the threshold  before he broke out railing at her. Oh, I can see her there at the door  this very minute, Master, pale and trembling, clinging to Thomas's arm,  her great eyes changing from sorrow and shame to wrath. It was just at  sunset and a red ray came in at the window and fell right across her  breast like a stain of blood.    \"Father called her a hard name, Master. Oh, he was too hard--even though  he was my father I must say he was too hard on her, broken-hearted as  she was, and guilty of nothing more after all than a little willfulness  in the matter of her marriage.    \"And father was sorry for it--Oh, Master, the word wasn't out of his  mouth before he was sorry for it. But the mischief was done. Oh, I'll  never forget Margaret's face, Master! It haunts me yet in the black  of the night. It was full of anger and rebellion and defiance. But she  never answered him back. She clenched her hands and went up to her old  room without saying a word, all those mad feelings surging in her  soul, and being held back from speech by her sheer, stubborn will. And,  Master, never a word did Margaret say from that day until after Kilmeny  was born--not one word, Master. Nothing we could do for her softened  her. And we were kind to her, Master, and gentle with her, and never  reproached her by so much as a look. But she would not speak to anyone.  She just sat in her room most of the time and stared at the wall with  such awful eyes. Father implored her to speak and forgive him, but she  never gave any sign that she heard him.    \"I haven't come to the worst yet, Master. Father sickened and took to  his bed. Margaret would not go in to see him. Then one night Thomas  and I were watching by him; it was about eleven o'clock. All at once he  said,    \"'Janet, go up and tell the lass'--he always called Margaret that--it  was a kind of pet name he had for her--'that I'm deein' and ask her to  come down and speak to me afore I'm gone.'    \"Master, I went. Margaret was sitting in her room all alone in the cold  and dark, staring at the wall. I told her what our father had said. She  never let on she heard me. I pleaded and wept, Master. I did what I had  never done to any human creature--I kneeled to her and begged her, as  she hoped for mercy herself, to come down and see our dying father.  Master, she wouldn't! She never moved or looked at me. I had to get up  and go downstairs and tell that old man she would not come.\"    Janet Gordon lifted her hands and struck them together in her agony of  remembrance.    \"When I told father he only said, oh, so gently,    \"'Poor lass, I was too hard on her. She isna to blame. But I canna go  to meet her mother till our little lass has forgie'n me for the name I  called her. Thomas, help me up. Since she winna come to me I must e'en  go to her.'    \"There was no crossing him--we saw that. He got up from his deathbed and  Thomas helped him out into the hall and up the stair. I walked behind  with the candle. Oh, Master, I'll never forget it--the awful shadows and  the storm wind wailing outside, and father's gasping breath. But we  got him to Margaret's room and he stood before her, trembling, with his  white hairs falling about his sunken face. And he prayed Margaret to  forgive him--to forgive him and speak just one word to him before  he went to meet her mother. Master\"--Janet's voice rose almost to  a shriek--\"she would not--she would not! And yet she WANTED to  speak--afterwards she confessed to me that she wanted to speak. But  her stubbornness wouldn't let her. It was like some evil power that  had gripped hold of her and wouldn't let go. Father might as well have  pleaded with a graven image. Oh, it was hard and dreadful! She saw her  father die and she never spoke the word he prayed for to him. THAT was  her sin, Master,--and for that sin the curse fell on her unborn child.  When father understood that she would not speak he closed his eyes and  was like to have fallen if Thomas had not caught him.    \"'Oh, lass, you're a hard woman,' was all he said. And they were his  last words. Thomas and I carried him back to his room, but the breath  was gone from him before we ever got him there.    \"Well, Master, Kilmeny was born a month afterwards, and when Margaret  felt her baby at her breast the evil thing that had held her soul in its  bondage lost its power. She spoke and wept and was herself again. Oh,  how she wept! She implored us to forgive her and we did freely and  fully. But the one against whom she had sinned most grievously was gone,  and no word of forgiveness could come to her from the grave. My poor  sister never knew peace of conscience again, Master. But she was gentle  and kind and humble until--until she began to fear that Kilmeny was  never going to speak. We thought then that she would go out of her mind.  Indeed, Master, she never was quite right again.    \"But that is the story and it's a thankful woman I am that the telling  of it is done. Kilmeny can't speak because her mother wouldn't.\"    Eric had listened with a gray horror on his face to the gruesome tale.  The black tragedy of it appalled him--the tragedy of that merciless law,  the most cruel and mysterious thing in God's universe, which ordains  that the sin of the guilty shall be visited on the innocent. Fight  against it as he would, the miserable conviction stole into his heart  that Kilmeny's case was indeed beyond the reach of any human skill.    \"It is a dreadful tale,\" he said moodily, getting up and walking  restlessly to and fro in the dim spruce-shadowed old kitchen where  they were. \"And if it is true that her mother's willful silence caused  Kilmeny's dumbness, I fear, as you say, that we cannot help her. But  you may be mistaken. It may have been nothing more than a strange  coincidence. Possibly something may be done for her. At all events, we  must try. I have a friend in Queenslea who is a physician. His name is  David Baker, and he is a very skilful specialist in regard to the throat  and voice. I shall have him come here and see Kilmeny.\"    \"Have your way,\" assented Janet in the hopeless tone which she might  have used in giving him permission to attempt any impossible thing.    \"It will be necessary to tell Dr. Baker why Kilmeny cannot speak--or why  you think she cannot.\"    Janet's face twitched.    \"Must that be, Master? Oh, it's a bitter tale to tell a stranger.\"    \"Don't be afraid. I shall tell him nothing that is not strictly  necessary to his proper understanding of the case. It will be quite  enough to say that Kilmeny may be dumb because for several months before  her birth her mother's mind was in a very morbid condition, and she  preserved a stubborn and unbroken silence because of a certain bitter  personal resentment.\"    \"Well, do as you think best, Master.\"    Janet plainly had no faith in the possibility of anything being done for  Kilmeny. But a rosy glow of hope flashed over Kilmeny's face when Eric  told her what he meant to do.    \"Oh, do you think he can make me speak?\" she wrote eagerly.    \"I don't know, Kilmeny. I hope that he can, and I know he will do all  that mortal skill can do. If he can remove your defect will you promise  to marry me, dearest?\"    She nodded. The grave little motion had the solemnity of a sacred  promise.    \"Yes,\" she wrote, \"when I can speak like other women I will marry you.\"        CHAPTER XVI. DAVID BAKER'S OPINION    The next week David Baker came to Lindsay. He arrived in the afternoon  when Eric was in school. When the latter came home he found that David  had, in the space of an hour, captured Mrs. Williamson's heart, wormed  himself into the good graces of Timothy, and become hail-fellow-well-met  with old Robert. But he looked curiously at Eric when the two young men  found themselves alone in the upstairs room.    \"Now, Eric, I want to know what all this is about. What scrape have you  got into? You write me a letter, entreating me in the name of friendship  to come to you at once. Accordingly I come post haste. You seem to be in  excellent health yourself. Explain why you have inveigled me hither.\"    \"I want you to do me a service which only you can do, David,\" said Eric  quietly. \"I didn't care to go into the details by letter. I have met in  Lindsay a young girl whom I have learned to love. I have asked her to  marry me, but, although she cares for me, she refuses to do so because  she is dumb. I wish you to examine her and find out the cause of her  defect, and if it can be cured. She can hear perfectly and all her other  faculties are entirely normal. In order that you may better understand  the case I must tell you the main facts of her history.\"    This Eric proceeded to do. David Baker listened with grave attention,  his eyes fastened on his friend's face. He did not betray the surprise  and dismay he felt at learning that Eric had fallen in love with a  dumb girl of doubtful antecedents; and the strange case enlisted his  professional interest. When he had heard the whole story he thrust his  hands into his pockets and strode up and down the room several times in  silence. Finally he halted before Eric.    \"So you have done what I foreboded all along you would do--left your  common sense behind you when you went courting.\"    \"If I did,\" said Eric quietly, \"I took with me something better and  nobler than common sense.\"    David shrugged his shoulders.    \"You'll have hard work to convince me of that, Eric.\"  "]]]
