No, sir; I am foolish enough to seek to conceal my affliction from  the world, and by the aid of this wonderful arm I have been hitherto  successful.\"    The doctor bowed.    \"So I beg you will keep my secret.\"    \"Rely upon it.\"    Hunston showed all his old cunning in this speech. Yet all his  inquiries, all his researches, availed him nothing.    The work of the dead Robert Emmerson remained as before, an inscrutable  mystery. It remained the silent executor of its creator's vengeance.    Slowly, yet surely fulfilling the blood-stained legend on the steel  arm.          CHAPTER XV.    HUNSTON AGAIN AT WORK-THE DANCING GARDEN--MARIETTA AND HER  GOSSIP-GREAT NEWS--THE ARREST--WHAT CHARGE?--MURDER.      Hunston's infirmity had told in many ways.    He had sunk to be a mere nonentity in the band.    Now he was but too pleased to be left at peace when in his great  suffering; yet no sooner did he recover health and spirits a little  than his old interest revived, and with his interest all the old  jealousies.    He bitterly resented Toro's assumption of the command.    \"Let the blustering bully fool impose upon them if he will,\" he said to  himself again and again; \"he never could take me in. It shall be my  task to show them who can render the most real service to the band.\"    Their programme suited Hunston well.    What could better have accorded with his humour than the devotion of  all their time, thought, and energies to the persecution--perhaps to  the entire destruction, of the Harkaway family?    It was all gone on with avowedly to avenge the death of Mathias.    Little cared Hunston about the dead brigand chief.    Indeed, but for the presence of his widow in their midst, and the  occasional mention of his name, Hunston would, in all probability, have  forgotten that he had ever existed.    As it was, he made it his especial task to hang about the parts of the  town where the Harkaways were most likely to be met. And never did he  appear twice in the same dress.    One evening, strolling into a dancing garden, he chanced to come upon a  smart young lady, whose appearance attracted his attention at once.    \"I know her well,\" he said to himself, \"though where I have seen her is  a puzzle to me for a moment.\"    The merry antics of one of the dancers caused her to laugh, and then he  recognised the sound of her voice immediately.    \"Marietta!\"    Surely he should not so soon have forgotten her.    Was it not upon the occasion of her memorable exploits at the gardens  of the Contessa Maraviglia that he had last seen her--that night when  poor Magog Brand met his fate?    As soon as he recognised her, he made up his mind to escort her.    So first (to assure himself of the excellence of his disguise) catching  a cursory glance of his shadow in a mirror, he crossed the garden, and  stepping up to her side, he addressed her.    \"Do you not join the dance, signorina?\" he said.    The waiting maid in reply only cocked her chin haughtily and moved  away.    \"You are proud, Marietta, to-night,\" said Hunston.    She turned upon hearing her name mentioned.    \"I do not know you, sir.\"    \"But you see I know you, Marietta, and what is more, if you were to ask  your master Mr. Harkaway or Mrs. Harkaway about their friend Saville, I  dare say they would not say any thing very bad about him.\"    Marietta curtseyed in some confusion.    \"I don't remember seeing you at the villa, signor,\" she said, \"so pray  excuse me.\"    \"No excuses, pretty Marietta; I am not a very constant visitor, yet I  have seen you, and yours is a face once seen not easily forgotten.\"    Marietta, like a true daughter of Eve, did not object to this sort of  thing.    And so she fell into the trap which he set for her with so little  pains.    That is, she grew gossipy and communicative.    \"And does Master Jack come here sometimes?\" asked the sham Mr. Saville.    She shook her head.    \"Never.\"    \"Mamma would object, of course,\" he said lightly; \"this is such a  wicked place for her good, mild, innocent boy to come to.\"    Marietta laughed a good deal at hearing young Jack spoken of thus.    \"Neither of the young gentlemen are too innocent,\" she said; \"but yet  they don't come here.\"    \"Possibly they have no taste for this sort of thing,\" suggested  Hunston.    Marietta shrugged her shoulders.    \"They are forbidden to go about alone.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I don't know--some fancy of the ladies. They think that the brigands  are always lurking about, ready to drop upon their boys.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Hunston; \"a very good joke.\"    \"Is it not? Although I must tell you that there is some reason for  fear, for I have twice come across the--\"    \"Across who?\"    \"The brigands.\"    \"Impossible.\"    \"It is true.\"    \"The miscreants. Did they steal any thing?\"    \"Well, only a few--a few kisses.\"    \"Hum!\" said Hunston, \"that was excusable. It is a sort of pilfering  which I would willingly indulge in myself.\"    \"I dare say,\" answered Marietta saucily, \"but I have discovered how to  use my weapons in self-defence.\"    \"What weapons?\"    \"These.\"    She held up her ten pretty little claws. A tiny hand they were mounted  on, too.    Hunston surveyed it with the eye of a connoisseur, and looked the  admiration he wished to convey quite extravagantly enough for a vain  woman to understand his meaning.    \"Exquisite,\" he said. \"It would be flattery even to be scratched by  such models.\"    She laughed.    He resumed.    \"And so they never go forth for fear of the brigands?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Their lives must be wretched, so confined to the house.\"    \"Aye, but they go out to sea.\"    \"To sea?\"    \"Yes, in their sailing boat; the two boys are always out fishing,  sailing, and what not.\"    Hunston pricked up his ears at these tidings.    \"Yes, on the water they are allowed full liberty, for brigands and  cats, according to Signor Harvey, are the two animals that fear the  water most.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Hunston, \"very good indeed, but I never knew that  brigands so feared the water.\"    \"So Signor Harvey says,\" replied Marietta. \"Indeed he says that a bar  of soap and a bowl of water would frighten a brigand more than a whole  armoury of firearms.\"    This was true.    Brigands may look picturesque when seen from a distance.    At close quarters they are, to put it mildly, objectionable.    If they do not hold soap and water in absolute fear, as Dick Harvey  said, they at least look upon them as vanities and effeminacies  unworthy of desperadoes.           *       *       *       *       *    \"So, so,\" muttered Hunston, as he walked away, \"I shall secure them  yet. For through the boys I can get at the father and at Harvey. Hah!\"    At this precise moment a heavy hand was placed upon his shoulder.    There was a professional touch in it, which once felt could never be  forgotten.    Hunston had felt such a clutch once in England, and the recollection  was likely to last him as long as he lived.    He forgot where he was, every thing, and instinctively he faltered this  inquiry--    \"On what charge?\"    \"Murder!\"    He knew the voice.    He had no need to look round; the voice was not one easily forgotten.    It was our old friend Pike, the English detective.    \"Yes, Hunston,\" replied the officer coolly. \"You have been giving me a  lot of trouble, but it was only a question of time and patience, I  knew. Come along; you are my prisoner.\"          CHAPTER XVI.    A GREAT DANGER--OFF AND AWAY!--POOR PIKE.      Hunston quailed. He was lost.    So suddenly--so unexpectedly had this come, that he was utterly  powerless to help himself.    Had he been wearing the mechanical arm, he might have able to tackle  the wiry officer Pike.    Bitterly did he curse his unlucky fate.    Recovering himself, however, in some slight degree, he endeavoured to  shake off the detective's hold.    \"Quiet, now, quiet, Master Hunston,\" said Pike, \"or I shall have to try  means for tranquilising you which you won't find agree with you.\"    \"Show me your warrant for this outrage,\" said Hunston.    \"Outrage! Hoity, toity! that's a good word.\"    \"I shall call the police to my assistance if you attempt to molest me,\"  said Hunston, putting on a lofty air.    This tickled Pike mightily.    \"Call the police, will you?\" he said. \"Well, I shan't, for I flatter  myself that I don't want much assistance to walk off with such a man as  you--even if you were not lopsided.\"    Hunston turned savagely upon the detective at this allusion to his  crippled state and made an attempt at using his one arm upon him.    But Pike was--to put it vulgarly--all there.    He dexterously dodged the blow, and whirling round secured a hold upon  Hunston's collar--that peculiar grip which is the specialty of men who  have been in the force.    Hunston struggled desperately to get free. In vain.    Do what he would, he found himself being trotted along to save himself  from strangulation.    Not only was it physically painful.    Hunston had an overweening sense of his own importance and dignity, and  this being run in just like some paltry pickpocket in a crowd, was  galling to his vanity beyond all description.    What could he do?    He was powerless.    The wondering people stared at this singular exhibition, but they  parted their ranks as Pike and his prisoner came along, and never  offered to interfere.    Now, during this brief but painful business, Hunston's thoughts ran  right ahead of the present dilemma.    He endeavoured to realise some of the possible consequences of it.    The arrest was, he felt assured, illegal.    What then?    What could result from such a proceeding?    Would they detain him?    Could they?--that was the question.    The British ambassador might be influenced by people of the rank and  position of the Harkaways.    This granted, it was easy enough for his excellency to waive legal  forms and ceremonies there, and get"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#19)"],[1,"some discussion as to the proposed meeting of chiefs; and  half an hour after, a dozen small canoes started with invitations to the  various chiefs to meet the captain at Hassan's campong, with assurances  that he was ready to overlook their share in the attack on the ship, and  be on friendly terms with them, and that the safety of each who attended  was guaranteed, whether he was willing to be on good terms with the  English or not. Four days later, the meeting took place in the newly  erected hall. Ten or twelve of the chiefs attended; others, who  had taken a leading part as Sehi's allies, did not venture to come  themselves, but sent messages with assurances of their desire to be on  friendly terms. A good deal of ceremonial was observed. The marines and  bluejackets were drawn up in line before the hall, which was decorated  with green boughs; a Union jack waved from a pole in front of it.    The chiefs were introduced by Hassan to the captain. The former then  addressed them, rehearsing the service that the English had done to them  by destroying the power of the tyrant who had long been a scourge to  his neighbors, and who intended, without doubt, to become master of the  whole district. As a proof of the good will of the English towards the  Malays, he related how the two English officers had leaped into the  water to save his child, and how kindly he himself had been treated.  Then the captain addressed them through the interpreter. He told them  that he had only been sent up the river by the Governor in accordance  with an invitation from Sehi, of whose conduct he was ignorant, to  undertake the protectorate of his district; and that, on learning his  true character, he at once reported to the Governor that the rajah was  not a proper person to receive protection, as not only did he prevent  trade and harass his neighbors, but was the owner of a number of  piratical craft, that often descended the river and plundered the coast.    \"England,\" he went on, \"has no desire whatever to take under her  protection any who do not earnestly desire it, and who are not willing,  in return, to promote trade, and keep peace with their neighbors;  nor can she make separate arrangements with minor chiefs. It was only  because she understood that Sehi ruled over a considerable extent of  territory, and was all powerful in this part, that his request was  listened to.    \"I shall shortly return down the river,\" he said, \"and have no thought  or intention of interfering in any way with matters here. I wish to  leave on good terms with you all, and to explain to you that it is to  your interest to do all in your power to further trade, both by sending  down your products to the coast, and by throwing no hindrance in the way  of the products of the highlands coming down the river, charging, at the  utmost, a very small toll upon each boat that passes up and down. It  is the interest of all of you, of the people of the hills, and of  ourselves, that trade should increase. Now that Sehi is dead and his  people altogether dispersed and all his piratical craft destroyed, with  the exception of the one captured by Hassan, there is no obstruction to  trade, and you are free from the fear that he would one day eat you up.    \"Be assured that there is nothing to be feared from us. You all know how  greatly the States protected by us have flourished and how wealthy their  rajahs have become from the increase of cultivation and the cessation  of tribal wars. If in the future all the chiefs of this district should  desire to place themselves under English protection, their request will  be considered; but there is not the slightest desire on the part of the  Governor to assume further responsibility, and he will be well satisfied  indeed to know that there is peace among the river tribes, security for  trade, and a large increase in the cultivation of the country and in its  prosperity.\"    There was a general expression of satisfaction and relief upon the face  of the chiefs, as, sentence by sentence, the speech was translated to  them; and, one by one, they rose after its conclusion, and expressed  their hearty concurrence with what had been said.    \"We know,\" one of them said, \"that these wars do much harm; but if we  quarrel, or if one ill treats another, or encourages his slaves to leave  him, or ravages his plantations, what are we to do?\"    \"That I have thought of,\" the captain said. \"I have spoken with the  chief Hassan, and he has agreed to remove with his people to the spot  where Sehi's town stood. There, doubtless, he will be joined by Sehi's  former subjects, who cannot but be well pleased at being rid of a tyrant  who had forcibly taken them under his rule. He will retain the prahu  that he has taken, and will use it to keep the two rivers free of  robbers, but in no other respect will he interfere with his neighbors.  His desire is to cultivate the land, clear away the forest, and  encourage his people to raise products that he can send down the river  to trade with us. He will occupy the territory only as far as the creek  that runs between the two rivers. I propose that all of you shall come  to an agreement to submit any disputes that may arise between you to his  decision, swearing to accept his judgment, whichever way it may go. This  is the way in which the disputes are settled in our country. Both sides  go before a judge, and he hears their statements and those of their  witnesses, and then decides the case; and even the government of the  country is bound by his decision. I don't wish you to give me any reply  as to this. I make the suggestion solely for your own good, and it is  for you to talk it over among yourselves, and see if you cannot all come  to an agreement that will put a stop to the senseless wars, and enable  your people to cultivate the land in peace, and to obtain all the  comforts that arise from trade.\"    A boat had been sent down to the ship, and this returned with a number  of the articles that had been put on board her as presents for Sehi and  other chiefs. These were now distributed. A feast was then held, and the  next morning the chiefs started for their homes, highly gratified with  the result of the meeting. On the following day, the British boats  also took their way down the river, followed by the prahu, with a  considerable number of Hassan's men, who were to clear away the ruins  of Sehi's campong, to bury the dead still lying among them, and to erect  huts for the whole community. The Serpent remained for a week opposite  the town; a considerable quantity of flour, sugar, and other useful  stores being landed for the use of Hassan's people. Dr. Horsley was  gladdened by Hassan's promise that his people should be instructed to  search for specimens of birds, butterflies, and other insects, and that  these should be treated according to his instructions, and should be  from time to time, as occasion offered, sent down to him in large cases  to Singapore. To the two midshipmen the chief gave krises of the finest  temper.    \"I have no presents to give you worthy of your acceptance,\" he said;  \"but you know that I shall never forget you, and always regard you as  brothers. I intend to send twelve of my young men down to Penang, there  to live for three years and learn useful trades from your people. The  doctor has advised me also to send Bahi, and has promised to find a  comfortable home for her, where she will learn to read and write your  language and many other useful things. It is hard to part with her;  but it is for her good and that of her people. If you will write to me  sometimes, she will read the letters to me and write letters to you in  return, so that, though we are away from each other, we may know that  neither of us has forgotten the other.\"    Bahi and twelve young Malays were taken to Penang in the Serpent, where  the doctor found a comfortable home for her with some friends of his,  to whom payment for her board and schooling was to be paid by Hassan  in blocks of tin, which he would obtain from boats coming down from the  hills in exchange for other articles of trade. The Malays were placed  with men of their own race belonging to the protected States, and  settled as carpenters, smiths, and other tradesmen in Penang. Three  years later, they and Bahi were all taken back in the Serpent to their  home.    The river was acquiring considerable importance from the great increase  of trade. They found Hassan's town far more extensive and flourishing  than it had been in the time of its predecessor. The forest had been  cleared for a considerable distance round it, the former inhabitants had  returned, tobacco, sugar canes, cotton, pepper, and other crops whose  products were useful for trade purposes, were largely cultivated, while  orchards of fruit trees had been extensively planted. Hassan reported  that tribal wars had almost ceased, and that disputes were in almost  all cases brought for his arbitration. Owing to the abolition of all  oppressive tolls, trade from the interior had very largely increased, a  great deal of tin, together with spices and other products, now finding  its way down by the river. Hassan was delighted with the progress Bahi  had made, and ordered that three or four boys should at once be placed  for instruction under each of the men who had learned trades at Penang.    There was much regret on both sides when the Serpent again started  down the river; for it was known that she would not return, as in a few  months she would be sent to a Chinese station, and from there would  go direct to England. The composition of her crew was already somewhat  changed. Lieutenant Ferguson had received his promotion for the fight  with the prahus, and had been appointed to the command of a gunboat  whose captain had been invalided home. Lieutenant Hopkins was now the  Serpent's first lieutenant, and Morrison was second. Harry Parkhurst was"]]]
