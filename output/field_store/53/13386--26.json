I thought it incumbent on me to Answer  this Memorial, in which I desir'd His Excellency to take into Custody any  one of my People that should be found trading even if it amounted to no  more than one of the Sailors selling his Cloaths from off his Back for a  Bottle of Rum--for what His Excellency called smuggling I was very  certain amounted to no more, and even this was only Suspicions of my own.    Thursday, 24th. This day a Spanish Packet (a Small Brig) from Buenos  Ayres put in here in her way to Spain. This Vessel belonged to his  Catholic Majesty, and notwithstanding the Vice-Roy had all along  pretended that the orders he had respecting Foreign Vessels were General,  yet this Vessel meet with very Different Treatment from us. No Guard was  put over her, and her Officers and Crew went wherever they pleased.* (*  The build and general appearance of the Endeavour not being that of a  man-of-war, the Portuguese authorities entertained suspicions regarding  her true character, which is not altogether surprising, considering the  times; but we can well understand Cook's indignation.)    Friday, 25th, Saturday, 26th. Employed getting on board Water as fast as  the Coopers could set up and repair the Casks, setting up the rigging and  Caulking the Ship's sides.    Sunday, 27th. Bent the Sails and Cleaned the Ship Fore and Aft.    Monday, 28th. Fine pleasant weather. The Caulkers having finished the  sides, paid them with Tar. This day I unexpectedly received an Answer  from my last Memorial, wherein were only a few weak Arguments to support  His Excellency's Suspicions that the Ship did not belong to the King, and  that my People Smugled. This Memorial I answered.    Tuesday, 29th. Employed Lashing the Casks that were on the upper Deck and  between Decks and making ready for Sea.    Wednesday, 30th. Punished Robert Anderson, Seaman, and William Judge,  Marine, with 12 Lashes Each, the former for leaving his Duty ashore and  attempting to desert from the Ship, and the latter for using abusive  language to the Officer of the Watch, and John Reading, Boatswain's Mate,  with 12 lashes for not doing his Duty in punishing the above two Men.  Sent a Shore to the Vice-Roy for a Pilot to Carry us to Sea, who sent one  on board together with a Large Boat, which I did not want, but it is the  Custom in this Port for the Pilots to have such a Boat to attend upon the  Ship they Pilot out, and for which you must pay 10 shillings per day,  besides the Pilot's fees, which is Seven pounds four Shillings Sterling.    [December 1768.]    Thursday, 1st December. Wind at South-East, which hinder'd us from  Sailing as we intended. Received on board a large Quantity of fresh Beef,  Greens and Yams for the Ship's Company.    Friday, 2nd. This morning sent a Packet for the Secretary of the  Admiralty on board the Spanish Pacquet, containing copies of all the  Memorials and Letters that have passed between the Vice-Roy and me, and  likewise another Packet containing Duplicates thereof I left with the  Vice-Roy to be by him forwarded to Lisbon. At 9 Weighed and came to Sail  and turned down the Bay. Peter Flower, Seaman, fell overboard, and before  any Assistance could be given him was drowned; in his room we got a  Portugue.    Saturday, 3rd. First part, moderate breezes at South-East; remainder,  fresh Gales at South with Rain. At 1 p.m. Anchored in 18 fathoms Water in  the Great Road (see Plan).    Sunday, 4th. Fore and Middle parts fresh Gales at South-South-East with  heavy rain; Latter, Variable Light Airs and fair weather. Hoisted in the  Long-boat and secured her.    Monday, 5th. First part, little wind and Cloudy; Middle, Thunder,  Lightning and Rain; latter, little wind at South-West and fair. At 4 a.m.  Weighed and tow'd down the Bay (being Calm) with an intent to go to Sea,  but having 2 Shott fired at us from Santa Cruze Fort was obliged to come  to an Anchor and to send a Boat to the Fort to know the Reason of their  firing, who it seems had no orders to let us pass, without which no Ship  can go to Sea. This surprized me not a little, as I had but this very  morning received a very Polite Letter from the Vice-Roy (in answer to one  I had wrote some days ago), wherein he wishes me a good voyage. I  immediately dispatched a petty Officer to the Vice-Roy to know the reason  why we was not permitted to pass the Fort; the Boat very soon return'd  with an order to the Captain of the Fort to let us pass, which Order had  been wrote some Days Ago, but either by Design or neglect had not been  sent. At 11 weighed in order to put to Sea, but before we could heave up  the Anchor, it got hold of a Rock, where it held fast in spite of all our  endeavours to Clear it until the Sea Breeze set in.    Tuesday, 6th. The Sea breeze continued all this day. At 2 p.m. the Ship  tended to the Wind, which cleared the Anchor. Hove it up and run higher  up the Bay and Anchored in 15 fathoms, a little below the Isle or Church  of Bon Voyage; found the cable very much rubbed several fathoms from the  Anchor.    Wednesday, 7th. First and latter part a Genteel breeze at South-East and  East; the Middle, Calm. At 5 a.m. weighed and tow'd out of the Bay; at 8  Discharged the Pilot and his Boat. A breeze of Wind Springing up Easterly  made Sail out to Sea, and sent a boat to one of the Islands laying before  the Bay to cut Brooms, a thing we was not permitted to do while we lay in  the Harbour; the Guard Boat which had constantly attended all the time we  lay in the Bay and Harbour did not leave us until the Pilot was  discharged. At noon the Sugar Loaf at the west Entrance of the Bay bore  North by West 1/2 West, distance, 8 or 9 miles.    [Description of Rio Janeiro.]    A DESCRIPTION OF THE BAY OR RIVER OF RIO DE JANEIRO.    The few days' delay we met with in getting out of Rio de Janeiro gave me  an opportunity of Drawing a Plan or Sketch of great part of the Bay, but  the Strict watch that was kept over us during our whole stay hinder'd me  from taking so accurate a Survey as I wisht to have done, and all the  Observations I could make was taken from on board the Ship. This Plan  hath no pretensions to accuracy, yet it will give a very good idea of the  place, differing not much from the truth in what is Essential.    The Bay of Rio de Janeiro, by some called a River--which its Name  Signifies--but this I think is improper, it being nothing more than a  Deep inlet of the Sea, into which no considerable fresh water River  Emptys itself that I could hear of. Be this as it will, it is Capacious  and Capable of Containing a vast Number of Shipping where they may ride  in perfect Security. The Entrance is Situated West by North 18 Leagues  from Cape Frio, and may be known by a remarkable Hill in the Form of a  Sugar Loaf, at the West Entrance of the Bay; but as all the Coast is  exceeding high, terminating at the top in Peaked Hills, it is much better  known by the Islands laying before it, one of which (called Rodonda) is  high and round in form of a Hay Stack, and lies South by West 2 1/2  leagues from the Sugar Loaf or Entrance of the Bay. A little without the  East Entrance of the Bay, and near the shore, lay 2 Islands near each  other: 3 leagues from the Eastward and 4 miles from the Shore are 2 low  Rocky Islands, which are the first you meet with in coming from the  Eastward or from Cape Frio.    To sail into Rio de Janeiro there is not the least Danger until you are  the length of the Fort of Santa Cruze, which stands on the point that  forms the East Entrance of the Bay or River; on the West Entrance is Fort  Lorio, built upon a Rock which lies close to the Main Land, the distance  from one Fort to the other is 3/4 of a mile East and West, but the  Channel for Shipping is not quite so broad by reason of Sunken Rocks  laying off each of the Forts; these rocks may not be properly placed in  the plan, being only laid down from the information of the Pilot. The  Narrowness of the Channell here causeth the Tides both Flood and Ebb to  run pretty strong, insomuch that you cannot Stem it without a fresh  breeze of Wind, nor is it safe Anchoring because the bottom is foul and  Rocky. By keeping in the Middle of the Channell you will not only avoid  being forced to come to an Anchor, but all other Dangers. Being got  within the entrance your Course up the Bay is North by West 1/2 West and  North-North-West something more than one League; this brings you the  length of the great Road, and North-West and West-North-West one league  more carrys you the length of the Ilha dos Cobras, which lies before the  City. Keep the North side of this Island close on board and Anchor above  it in 5 fathoms of water, where you see most Convenient before the  Monastery of Benedictines, which stands upon a hill at the North-West End  of the City. Small Ships and Vessels generally lay between the Town and  the Ilha dos Cobras, but in order to get there they must come round the  North side of the Island.    I shall now give the best description I can of the Different Forts that  are Erected for the Defence of the Bay. The first you meet with coming in  from Sea is a Battery of 22 Guns, seated in the Bottom of a sandy Bay,  which is on the South side of the Sugar Loaf, and can be designed for no  other use than to hinder an Enemy from landing in that valley, from  whence I suppose they may March up to the Town or round by the West side  of the Sugar Loaf to attack the Forts that are on that side of the  Entrance into the Bay, the first of which is Seated under the foot of the  Sugar Loaf on a low Isthmus which joyns the Peninsula or point of the Bay"]]]
