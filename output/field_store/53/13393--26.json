Lords  and ladies of the realm followed; and finally, the ten companies of  archers, whose progress round the field was greeted with hardly less  applause than that given the King himself.    The King and Queen dismounted from their steeds, ascended the steps  of the royal box, and seated themselves upon two thrones, decked with  purple and gold trapping, upon a dais sheltered by striped canvas. In  the booths at each side the members of the Court took their places;  while comely pages ran hither and thither bearing the royal commands.  'Twas a lordly sight, I ween, this shifting of proud courtiers, flashing  of jeweled fans, and commingling of bright colors with costly gems!    Now the herald arose to command peace, and soon the clear note of his  bugle rose above the roar of the crowd and hushed it to silence. The  tenscore archers ranged themselves in two long rows on each side of  the lists--a gallant array--while their captains, as a special mark of  favor, stood near the royal box.    \"Come hither, Tepus,\" said the King to his bow-bearer. \"Come, measure me  out this line, how long our mark must be.\"    \"What is the reward?\" then asked the Queen.    \"That will the herald presently proclaim,\" answered the King. \"For first  prize we have offered a purse containing twoscore golden pounds; for  second, a purse containing twoscore silver pennies; and for third a  silver bugle, inlaid with gold. Moreover, if the King's companies keep  these prizes, the winning companies shall have, first, two tuns of  Rhenish wine; second, two tuns of English beer; and, third, five of  the fattest harts that run on Dallom Lea. Methinks that is a princely  wager,\" added King Harry laughingly.    Up spake bold Clifton, secure in the King's favor. \"Measure no marks for  us, most sovereign liege,\" quoth he; \"for such largess as that, we'll  shoot at the sun and the moon.\"    \"'Twill not be so far as that,\" said the King. \"But get a line of good  length, Tepus, and set up the targets at tenscore paces.\"    Forthwith, Tepus bowed low, and set up ten targets, each bearing the  pennant of a different company, while the herald stood forth again and  proclaimed the rules and prizes. The entries were open to all comers.  Each man, also, of the King's archers should shoot three arrows at the  target bearing the colors of his band, until the best bowman in each  band should be chosen. These ten chosen archers should then enter a  contest for an open target--three shots apiece--and here any other  bowman whatsoever was asked to try his skill. The result at the open  targets should decide the tourney.    Then all the people shouted again, in token that the terms of the  contest pleased them; and the archers waved their bows aloft, and  wheeled into position facing their respective targets.    The shooting now began, upon all the targets at once, and the multitude  had so much ado to watch them, that they forgot to shout. Besides,  silence was commanded during the shooting. Of all the fine shooting that  morning, I have not now space to tell you. The full score of men shot  three times at each target, and then three times again to decide a tie.  For, more than once, the arrow shot by one man would be split wide  open by his successor. Every man's shaft bore his number to ease the  counting; and so close would they stick at the end of a round, that the  target looked like a big bristle hairbrush. Then must the spectators  relieve their tense spirits by great cheering; while the King looked  mighty proud of his skilled bowmen.    At last the company targets were decided, and Tepus, as was expected,  led the score, having made six exact centers in succession. Gilbert  of the White Hand followed with five, and Clifton with four. Two other  captains had touched their center four times, but not roundly. While in  the other companies it so chanced that the captains had been out-shot by  some of the men under them.    The winners then saluted the King and Queen, and withdrew for a space to  rest and renew their bow-strings for the keenest contest of all; while  the lists were cleared and a new target--the open one--was set up at  twelvescore paces. At the bidding of the King, the herald announced  that the open target was to be shot at, to decide the title of the best  archer in all England; and any man there present was privileged to try  for it. But so keen had been the previous shooting, that many yeomen who  had come to enter the lists now would not do so; and only a dozen men  stepped forth to give in their names.    \"By my halidom!\" said the King, \"these must be hardy men to pit  themselves against my archers!\"    \"Think you that your ten chosen fellows are the best bowmen in all  England?\" asked the Queen.    \"Aye, and in all the world beside,\" answered the King; \"and thereunto I  would stake five hundred pounds.\"    \"I am minded to take your wager,\" said the Queen musingly, \"and will  e'en do so if you grant me a boon.\"    \"What is it?\" asked the King.    \"If I produce five archers who can out-shoot your ten, will you grant my  men full grace and amnesty?\"    \"Assuredly!\" quoth the King in right good humor. \"Nathless, I tell you  now, your wager is in jeopardy, for there never were such bowmen as  Tepus and Clifton and Gilbert!\"    \"Hum!\" said the Queen puckering her brow, still as though lost in  thought. \"I must see if there be none present to aid me in my wager.  Boy, call hither Sir Richard of the Lea and my lord Bishop of Hereford!\"    The two summoned ones, who had been witnessing the sport, came forward.    \"Sir Richard,\" said she, \"thou art a full knight and good. Would'st  advise me to meet a wager of the King's, that I can produce other  archers as good as Tepus and Gilbert and Clifton?\"    \"Nay, Your Majesty,\" he said, bending his knee. \"There be none present  that can match them. Howbeit,\"--he added dropping his voice--\"I have  heard of some who lie hid in Sherwood Forest who could show them strange  targets.\"    The Queen smiled and dismissed him.    \"Come hither, my lord Bishop of Hereford,\" quoth she, \"would'st thou  advance a sum to support my wager 'gainst the King?\"    \"Nay, Your Majesty,\" said the fat Bishop, \"an you pardon me, I'd not lay  down a penny on such a bet. For by my silver mitre, the King's archers  are men who have no peers.\"    \"But suppose I found men whom _thou knewest_ to be masters at the bow,\"  she insisted roguishly, \"would'st thou not back them? Belike, I have  heard that there be men round about Nottingham and Plympton who carry  such matters with a high hand!\"    The Bishop glanced nervously around, as if half expecting to see Robin  Hood's men standing near; then turned to find the Queen looking at him  with much amusement lurking in her eyes.    \"Odds bodikins! The story of my misadventure must have preceded me!\" he  thought, ruefully. Aloud he said, resolved to face it out,    \"Your Majesty, such tales are idle and exaggerated. An you pardon me, I  would add to the King's wager that his men are invincible.\"    \"As it pleases thee,\" replied the Queen imperturbably. \"How much?\"    \"Here is my purse,\" said the Bishop uneasily. \"It contains fifteen score  nobles, or near a hundred pounds.\"    \"I'll take it at even money,\" she said, dismissing him; \"and Your  Majesty\"--turning to the King who had been conversing with the two  princes and certain of the nobles--\"I accept your wager of five hundred  pounds.\"    \"Very good,\" said the King, laughing as though it were a great jest.  \"But what had minded you to take such interest in the sport, of a  sudden?\"    \"It is as I have said. I have found five men whom I will pit against any  you may produce.\"    \"Then we will try their skill speedily,\" quoth the King. \"How say you,  if first we decide this open target and then match the five best thereat  against your unknown champions?\"    \"Agreed,\" said the Queen. Thereupon she signed to Maid Marian to  step forward, from a near-by booth where she sat with other  ladies-in-waiting, and whispered something in her ear. Marian courtesied  and withdrew.    Now the ten chosen archers from the King's bands came forth again and  took their stand; and with them stood forth the twelve untried men from  the open lists. Again the crowd was stilled, and every eye hung upon the  speeding of the shafts. Slowly but skilfully each man shot, and as  his shaft struck within the inner ring a deep breath broke from the  multitude like the sound of the wind upon the seashore. And now Gilbert  of the White Hand led the shooting, and 'twas only by the space of a  hairsbreadth upon the line that Tepus tied his score. Stout Elwyn, the  Welshman, took third place; one of the private archers, named Geoffrey,  come fourth; while Clifton must needs content himself with fifth.    The men from the open lists shot fairly true, but nervousness and fear  of ridicule wrought their undoing.    The herald then came forward again, and, instead of announcing the  prize-winners, proclaimed that there was to be a final contest. Two  men had tied for first place, declared His Majesty the King, and three  others were entitled to honors. Now all these five were to shoot  again, and they were to be pitted against five other of the Queen's  choosing--men who had not yet shot upon that day.    A thrill of astonishment and excitement swept around the arena. \"Who  were these men of the Queen's choosing?\" was upon every lip. The hubbub  of eager voices grew intense; and in the midst of it all, the gate at  the far end of the field opened and five men entered and escorted a lady  upon horseback across the arena to the royal box. The lady was instantly  recognized as Mistress Marian of the Queen's household, but no one  seemed to know the faces of her escort. Four were clad in Lincoln green,  while the fifth, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#19)"],[1,"on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair. He  wore black velvet, and the kind of collar--all frills and lacey--that  Robert would rather have died than wear; but then the little French boy  was much younger than Robert.    'Oh, how pretty!' said every one. But no one meant the little French  boy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair.    What every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very green,  and standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round with very  bright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. There were tiny  candles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet.    'But yes--is it not that it is genteel?' said the lady. 'Sit down you  then, and let us see.'    The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall, and  the lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood flame, and then she  drew the curtains and lit the little candles, and when they were all  lighted the little French boy suddenly shouted, 'Bravo, ma tante! Oh,  que c'est gentil,' and the English children shouted 'Hooray!'    Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out fluttered the  Phoenix--spread his gold wings, flew to the top of the Christmas-tree,  and perched there.    'Ah! catch it, then,' cried the lady; 'it will itself burn--your genteel  parrakeet!'    'It won't,' said Robert, 'thank you.'    And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the lady  was so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down on  the shiny walnut-wood table.    'Is it that it talks?' asked the lady.    And the Phoenix replied in excellent French. It said, 'Parfaitement,  madame!'    'Oh, the pretty parrakeet,' said the lady. 'Can it say still of other  things?'    And the Phoenix replied, this time in English, 'Why are you sad so near  Christmas-time?'    The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, for  the youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice that  strangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the reason of  their tears. And, of course, the lady began to cry again, very much  indeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart; and she could  not find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered hers, which was still very  damp and no use at all. She also hugged the lady, and this seemed to be  of more use than the handkerchief, so that presently the lady stopped  crying, and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes, and called  Anthea a cherished angel.    'I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,' said Anthea, 'but we  really only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.'    'Oh, my little angel,' said the poor lady, sniffing, 'to-day and for  hundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family. To-morrow it must  that I sell it to some strangers--and my little Henri, who ignores  all, he will not have never the lands paternal. But what will you? His  father, my brother--Mr the Marquis--has spent much of money, and it the  must, despite the sentiments of familial respect, that I admit that my  sainted father he also--'    'How would you feel if you found a lot of money--hundreds and thousands  of gold pieces?' asked Cyril.    The lady smiled sadly.    'Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?' she said. 'It is  true that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one of our  ancestors has hid a treasure--of gold, and of gold, and of gold--enough  to enrich my little Henri for the life. But all that, my children, it is  but the accounts of fays--'    'She means fairy stories,' whispered the Phoenix to Robert. 'Tell her  what you have found.'    So Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she  should faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with the  earnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight.    'It's no use explaining how we got in,' said Robert, when he had told  of the finding of the treasure, 'because you would find it a little  difficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe. But we can  show you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away.'    The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugs  of the girls.    'No, he's not making it up,' said Anthea; 'it's true, TRUE, TRUE!--and  we are so glad.'    'You would not be capable to torment an old woman?' she said; 'and it is  not possible that it be a dream.'    'It really IS true,' said Cyril; 'and I congratulate you very much.'    His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the raptures  of the others.    'If I do not dream,' she said, 'Henri come to Manon--and you--you shall  come all with me to Mr the Curate. Is it not?'    Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief  twisted round her head. She took Henri, who was already sleepy with the  excitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and when the lady had  put on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pair  of black wooden clogs over her black cashmere house-boots, the whole  party went down the road to a little white house--very like the one they  had left--where an old priest, with a good face, welcomed them with a  politeness so great that it hid his astonishment.    The lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging French  shoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story. And now the  priest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS hands  and spoke also in French.    'He thinks,' whispered the Phoenix, 'that her troubles have turned her  brain. What a pity you know no French!'    'I do know a lot of French,' whispered Robert, indignantly; 'but it's  all about the pencil of the gardener's son and the penknife of the  baker's niece--nothing that anyone ever wants to say.'    'If _I_ speak,' the bird whispered, 'he'll think HE'S mad, too.'    'Tell me what to say.'    'Say \"C'est vrai, monsieur. Venez donc voir,\"' said the Phoenix; and  then Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying,  very loudly and distinctly--    'Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.'    The priest was disappointed when he found that Robert's French began and  ended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw that if the lady  was mad she was not the only one, and he put on a big beavery hat, and  got a candle and matches and a spade, and they all went up the hill to  the wayside shrine of St John of Luz.    'Now,' said Robert, 'I will go first and show you where it is.'    So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert did  go first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly as  they had left it. And every one was flushed with the joy of performing  such a wonderfully kind action.    Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as French  people do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked very fast  and both together, and the lady embraced all the children three times  each, and called them 'little garden angels,' and then she and the  priest shook each other by both hands again, and talked, and talked, and  talked, faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible.  And the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure.    'Get away NOW,' said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiant  dream.    So the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and the  lady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that they never  noticed that the guardian angels had gone.    The 'garden angels' ran down the hill to the lady's little house, where  they had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it out and  said 'Home,' and no one saw them disappear, except little Henri, who  had flattened his nose into a white button against the window-glass, and  when he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming. So that  was all right.    'It is much the best thing we've done,' said Anthea, when they talked  it over at tea-time. 'In the future we'll only do kind actions with the  carpet.'    'Ahem!' said the Phoenix.    'I beg your pardon?' said Anthea.    'Oh, nothing,' said the bird. 'I was only thinking!'        CHAPTER 7. MEWS FROM PERSIA      When you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo  Station quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it may  make you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful. But if  you think this you will be wrong. The fact is, mother arranged with Aunt  Emma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo, when they went back  from their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst. The train was fixed, but not  the day. Then mother wrote to Aunt Emma, giving her careful instructions  about the day and the hour, and about luggage and cabs and things, and  gave the letter to Robert to post. But the hounds happened to meet near  Rufus Stone that morning, and what is more, on the way to the meet they  met Robert, and Robert met them, and instantly forgot all about posting  Aunt Emma's letter, and never thought of it again until he and  the others had wandered three times up and down the platform at  Waterloo--which makes six in all--and had bumped against old gentlemen,  and stared in the faces of ladies, and been shoved by people in a hurry,  and 'by-your-leaved' by porters with trucks, and were quite, quite sure  that Aunt Emma was not there. Then suddenly the true truth of what he  had forgotten to do came home to Robert, and he said, 'Oh, crikey!' and  stood still with his mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bag  in each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily  into him, and never so much as said, 'Where are you shoving to now?' or,  'Look out where you're going, can't you?' The heavier bag smote him at  the knee, and he staggered, but he said nothing.    When the others understood what was the matter I think they told Robert  what they thought of him.    'We must "]]]
