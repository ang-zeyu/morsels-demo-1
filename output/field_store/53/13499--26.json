When we discover that he  was a man of more than usually nervous temperament, very different in  quality from any of his relatives, we must not forget what a fatiguing  journey had been performed by his mother, who was then awaiting her  delivery. Even supposing that Lodovico Buonarroti travelled from  Florence by Arezzo to Caprese, many miles of rough mountain-roads must  have been traversed by her on horseback.      III    Ludovico, who, as we have seen, was Podesta of Caprese and of Chiusi  in the Casentino, had already one son by his first wife, Francesca,  the daughter of Neri di Miniato del Sera and Bonda Rucellai. This  elder brother, Lionardo, grew to manhood, and become a devoted  follower of Savonarola. Under the influence of the Ferrarese friar, he  determined to abjure the world, and entered the Dominican Order in  1491. We know very little about him, and he is only once mentioned in  Michelangelo's correspondence. Even this reference cannot be  considered certain. Writing to his father from Rome, July 1, 1497,  Michelangelo says: \"I let you know that Fra Lionardo returned hither  to Rome. He says that he was forced to fly from Viterbo, and that his  frock had been taken from him, wherefore he wished to go there  (_i.e._, to Florence). So I gave him a golden ducat, which he asked  for; and I think you ought already to have learned this, for he should  be there by this time.\" When Lionardo died is uncertain. We only know  that he was in the convent of S. Mark at Florence in the year 1510.  Owing to this brother's adoption of the religious life, Michelangelo  became, early in his youth, the eldest son of Lodovico's family. It  will be seen that during the whole course of his long career he acted  as the mainstay of his father, and as father to his younger brothers.  The strength and the tenacity of his domestic affections are very  remarkable in a man who seems never to have thought of marrying.  \"Art,\" he used to say, \"is a sufficiently exacting mistress.\" Instead  of seeking to beget children for his own solace, he devoted himself to  the interests of his kinsmen.    The office of Podesta lasted only six months, and at the expiration of  this term Lodovico returned to Florence. He put the infant  Michelangelo out to nurse in the village of Settignano, where the  Buonarroti Simoni owned a farm. Most of the people of that district  gained their livelihood in the stone-quarries around Settignano and  Maiano on the hillside of Fiesole. Michelangelo's foster-mother was  the daughter and the wife of stone-cutters. \"George,\" said he in  after-years to his friend Vasari, \"if I possess anything of good in my  mental constitution, it comes from my having been born in your keen  climate of Arezzo; just as I drew the chisel and the mallet with which  I carve statues in together with my nurse's milk.\"    When Michelangelo was of age to go to school, his father put him under  a grammarian at Florence named Francesco da Urbino. It does not  appear, however, that he learned more than reading and writing in  Italian, for later on in life we find him complaining that he knew no  Latin. The boy's genius attracted him irresistibly to art. He spent  all his leisure time in drawing, and frequented the society of youths  who were apprenticed to masters in painting and sculpture. Among these  he contracted an intimate friendship with Francesco Granacci, at that  time in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandajo. Granacci used to lend  him drawings by Ghirlandajo, and inspired him with the resolution to  become a practical artist. Condivi says that \"Francesco's influence,  combined with the continual craving of his nature, made him at last  abandon literary studies. This brought the boy into disfavour with his  father and uncles, who often used to beat him severely; for, being  insensible to the excellence and nobility of Art, they thought it  shameful to give her shelter in their house. Nevertheless, albeit  their opposition caused him the greatest sorrow, it was not sufficient  to deter him from his steady purpose. On the contrary, growing even  bolder he determined to work in colours.\" Condivi, whose narrative  preserves for us Michelangelo's own recollections of his youthful  years, refers to this period the painted copy made by the young  draughtsman from a copper-plate of Martin Schoengauer. We should  probably be right in supposing that the anecdote is slightly  antedated. I give it, however, as nearly as possible in the  biographer's own words. \"Granacci happened to show him a print of S.  Antonio tormented by the devils. This was the work of Martino  d'Olanda, a good artist for the times in which he lived; and  Michelangelo transferred the composition to a panel. Assisted by the  same friend with colours and brushes, he treated his subject in so  masterly a way that it excited surprise in all who saw it, and even  envy, as some say, in Domenico, the greatest painter of his age. In  order to diminish the extraordinary impression produced by this  picture, Ghirlandajo went about saying that it came out of his own  workshop, as though he had some part in the performance. While engaged  on this piece, which, beside the figure of the saint, contained many  strange forms and diabolical monstrosities, Michelangelo coloured no  particular without going first to Nature and comparing her truth with  his fancies. Thus he used to frequent the fish-market, and study the  shape and hues of fishes' fins, the colour of their eyes, and so forth  in the case of every part belonging to them; all of which details he  reproduced with the utmost diligence in his painting.\" Whether this  transcript from Schoengauer was made as early as Condivi reports may,  as I have said, be reasonably doubted. The anecdote is interesting,  however, as showing in what a naturalistic spirit Michelangelo began  to work. The unlimited mastery which he acquired over form, and which  certainly seduced him at the close of his career into a stylistic  mannerism, was based in the first instance upon profound and patient  interrogation of reality.      IV    Lodovico perceived at length that it was useless to oppose his son's  natural bent. Accordingly, he sent him into Ghirlandajo's workshop. A  minute from Ghirlandajo's ledger, under the date 1488, gives  information regarding the terms of the apprenticeship. \"I record this  first of April how I, Lodovico di Lionardo di Buonarrota, bind my son  Michelangelo to Domenico and Davit di Tommaso di Currado for the next  three ensuing years, under these conditions and contracts: to wit,  that the said Michelangelo shall stay with the above-named masters  during this time, to learn the art of painting, and to practise the  same, and to be at the orders of the above-named; and they, for their  part, shall give to him in the course of these three years twenty-four  florins (_fiorini di suggello_): to wit, six florins in the first  year, eight in the second, ten in the third; making in all the sum of  ninety-six pounds (_lire_).\" A postscript, dated April 16th of the  same year, 1488, records that two florins were paid to Michelangelo  upon that day.    It seems that Michelangelo retained no very pleasant memory of his  sojourn with the Ghirlandajo brothers. Condivi, in the passage  translated above, hints that Domenico was jealous of him. He proceeds  as follows: \"This jealousy betrayed itself still more when  Michelangelo once begged the loan of a certain sketch-book, wherein  Domenico had portrayed shepherds with their flocks and watchdogs,  landscapes, buildings, ruins, and such-like things. The master refused  to lend it; and indeed he had the fame of being somewhat envious; for  not only showed he thus scant courtesy toward Michelangelo, but he  also treated his brother likewise, sending him into France when he saw  that he was making progress and putting forth great promise; and doing  this not so much for any profit to David, as that he might himself  remain the first of Florentine painters. I have thought fit to mention  these things, because I have been told that Domenico's son is wont to  ascribe the genius and divinity of Michelangelo in great part to his  father's teaching, whereas the truth is that he received no assistance  from that master. I ought, however, to add that Michelangelo does not  complain: on the contrary, he praises Domenico both as artist and as  man.\"    This passage irritated Vasari beyond measure. He had written his first  Life of Michelangelo in 1550. Condivi published his own modest  biography in 1553, with the expressed intention of correcting errors  and supplying deficiencies made by \"others,\" under which vague word he  pointed probably at Vasari. Michelangelo, who furnished Condivi with  materials, died in 1564; and Vasari, in 1568, issued a second enlarged  edition of the Life, into which he cynically incorporated what he  chose to steal from Condivi's sources. The supreme Florentine sculptor  being dead and buried, Vasari felt that he was safe in giving the lie  direct to this humble rival biographer. Accordingly, he spoke as  follows about Michelangelo's relations with Domenico Ghirlandajo: \"He  was fourteen years of age when he entered that master's service, and  inasmuch as one (Condivi), who composed his biography after 1550, when  I had published these Lives for the first time, declares that certain  persons, from want of familiarity with Michelangelo, have recorded  things that did not happen, and have omitted others worthy of  relation; and in particular has touched upon the point at issue,  accusing Domenico of envy, and saying that he never rendered  Michelangelo assistance.\"--Here Vasari, out of breath with  indignation, appeals to the record of Lodovico's contract with the  Ghirlandajo brothers. \"These minutes,\" he goes on to say, \"I copied  from the ledger, in order to show that everything I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11246"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 14, No. 394, (#2)"],[1,"monument was  restored in 1820, at the expense of the parish, \"in testimony of their  grateful sense of obligation to a family whose eminent virtue and  munificence it is intended to perpetuate.\"    In the vestry of this church is preserved a finely executed portrait of  the \"Virgin Queen,\" in stained glass; and there is also another window  consisting of the effigy of St. Matthias, but this is not to be compared  with the other for execution.    A.P.D.           *       *       *       *       *      CONSTANTINOPLE.    _(For the Mirror.)_      One of the finest buildings in Constantinople is a fountain in an open  square, near the seraglio gate; it is a place built and maintained by  the Grand Vizier, for the people to come and draw water, who have it  served out to them in great jugs by people who are constantly in  attendance to fill them; the jugs are chained to the place, and stand in  rows about four feet from the ground, between gilt iron bars in front of  the building. There are men always ready inside to draw the water and  fill the jugs, which till people come are kept full; these men receive a  yearly salary.    The houses are chiefly built of wood, and reach so far over the top that  in some of the streets it would be very possible to get from the windows  of one house to another across the street. By this manner of building,  any one who has seen the place will not wonder at the frequent and fatal  conflagrations there, for if once a fire break out it must burn till it  comes to some garden or large vacant place to stop at. The Bussard is  the most regular part of the city, and has a number of parallel streets  crossing one another, and covered at the top with planks which keep out  the rain and sun. Here all the richest and finest goods in  Constantinople are put out to show, as a pattern or sample of the  merchants' stock, for sale in their warehouses at home. Every street has  its particular trade, so that there is no mixture of shops as in other  capitals. One street is occupied by goldsmiths, another by silk and  brocade merchants; grocers and tailors have also different streets to  themselves. The city is always shut up at ten at night, so that no one  can have entrance or get out after that time. Indeed there is scarcely  any one in the streets after dusk, for every one then goes to rest, so  that when daylight is gone no business can be transacted; but the people  are obliged to pray every night one hour and a half after dark, when the  priests go up into the towers of the mosques, and in a loud voice call  crowds to prayers in these words:--\"God is great; (three times) give  testimony there is but one God, yield yourselves to his mercy, and pray  to him to forgive your sins. God is great (three times more) there is no  other God but God.\"    INA.           *       *       *       *       *        THE NOVELIST.             *       *       *       *       *      THE BACHELOR'S REVENGE.    _(For the Mirror.)_      Mr. Hardingham, or as some of his very intimate friends used to call  him, Jack Hardingham, lived in a dull looking house in ---- Square, his  profession (the law) was dull, his fire and fireside were dull; and as  he sat by the former one dull evening, in the dullest of all his dull  humours, and of such the lonely bachelor had many, he sighed, kicked his  shins, and looked into his books; but as that was like gazing upon a  very ugly face, he shut them again, and rang the bell. It was answered  by a portly dame, whose age might be about some four or five and forty,  whose complexion was fair, whose chubby cheeks were brilliantly rosy,  and whose black eyes were so vividly lustrous, that one might have  fancied the delicate cap-border near them, in danger from their fire.  Over her full-formed bust, she wore a clear, and stiffly-starched muslin  habit-shirt of purest white, a beautiful lace-edged ruff around her  throat, over her ample shoulders was thrown a fawn-coloured shawl, and  she wore also, a silver gray gown of the material called Norwich crape,  with an apron rivalling in whiteness cap, habit-shirt, and ruff. We are  particular in describing the costume of this fair creature, because when  _dress_ is invariably the same, it has unity with _person_; it is  identified with its wearer, and our affections even are caught and  retained by it, in a manner of which few are aware. On the exterior of  the lady whom we have endeavoured to portray, \"housekeeper\" was as  indelibly stamped as the effigy of our king on the coin of the realm;  and in a most soft and insinuating tone, she said, \"Would you be pleased  to want any thing, sir?\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Honeydew--go and ask if they can't let me have De Vere.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Or the Chronicles of the Canongate.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Or Anne of Geierstein.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Or the Loves of the Poets.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Or, d'ye hear, hang it, tell Mr. Mason there are seven or eight other  new works, the names of which I have forgotten, and he must recollect.\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    \"Stop, stop--don't be in such a hurry--tell him, he has never ordered  for me the Quarterly, as I desired--that I want to see the United  Service Journal, and Blackwood for the month; and that if he chooses to  charge four pence a night for his new novels, I'll not read one of  them.\"    \"Of course, sir; I'll tell him, for 'tis a shame, a real shame, for any  body to _repose_ on, as one may say, a gentleman like yourself. Never  fear, but I'll tell him.\"    The lady retired, the door closed, and Mr. Hardingham sighed, \"A worthy  creature is Martha Honeydew.\" \"Come in,\" cried the gentleman in a most  amiable tone, as he presently recognised his housekeeper's tap at the  parlour door, and with a curtsey she entered.    \"O law, law! Mr. Hardingham, sir--Mr. Mason says--but I don't like to  give you all his message, indeed I don't--Mr. Mason says--but I hope  you'll never send me on such an _arrant_ again--he says, sir--O but I'm  sorry for it, that I am--he says then, that the _Quarter_ you _ax'd_  for, ar'n't come yet, and there's time enough for you to read it in when  it _do_; that the Blackwood and the Officers' Magazine are _hout_; that  you may go without your new novels afore he'll let you have 'em  _chaiper_ than other folks, (and there's a shocking shame, sir!) and as  for the works you mentioned, there's fifty new ones at least to choose  from; but he can't remember what you don't be pleased to recollect  yourself. Dear heart! to think of a gentleman like you, sir, being  _trated_ thus; why, my blood _biled_ within me; and I wouldn't demean  myself to bring back any thing for you from that place; but I took the  liberty, sir, to get you 'Damon and Dorinda,' a sweet pretty thing, from  another.\"    \"Ah!\" sighed the bachelor, \"I see there's nobody in this world cares for  poor Jack Hardingham, but Martha Honeydew;\" and he felt sorry that his  housekeeper had departed ere his lips had emitted this grateful praise.  Yes, Mr. Hardingham felt vexed he scarcely knew why; and uncommonly  discontented he knew not wherefore; but had he troubled himself to  analyze such feelings, he would have discerned their origin to be  solitude and idleness. Mrs. Honeydew brought tea; she had buttered a  couple of muffins superlatively well; and making her master's fire burn  exceedingly bright, placed them on the cat before it, and a kettle,  which immediately commenced a delicate bravura, upon the glowing coals;  then, modestly waiting at the distance of a few paces from her master  until the water quite boiled, she fixed her brilliant eyes upon his  countenance with an expression _intended_ to be _piteous_.    \"Mrs. Honeydew--Martha,\" said Hardingham in a low querulous tone, \"I  fancy I'm going to have a fit of the gout, or a bilious fever.\"    \"_Fancy_, indeed, sir; why, I never saw you looking haler.\"    \"Ay, Ay, so much the worse; a fit of apoplexy then maybe.\"    \"Lauk, lauk! sir; a fit of the blue devils more likely. How can you talk  so? A fit of _perplexity_! Dear, dear! how some men do go on to be  sure;\" pouring the steaming water upon the tea.    \"You are a kind comforter, Martha; nobody ever raises my spirits like  you. Get me my little leathern trunk.\"    \"Why, then, that I won't;\" getting it down from a closet-shelf as she  spoke. \"I wish it was burnt with all my heart, that I do; making you so  _lammancholy_ as it always _do_.\"    And well might this trunk make Mr. Hardingham melancholy, for it was the  receptacle of letters and little gifts of a lady who had jilted him in  early life; and upon whom he had often vowed vengeance. She was yet  unmarried; but--no--her once devoted admirer was resolved to follow the  lady's advice, and place his \"affections upon a worthier object than  Caroline Dalton;\" and, thought he to himself, she shall at last see that  I have _found one_; nor shall wild Tom, my graceless nephew, who lives  upon my fortune, ever more touch one penny of it. The postman rapped,  and in a few minutes his housekeeper appeared with many apologies for  bringing to him her own newspaper, but perhaps in it he might be able to  find the names of some of the new novels that he wished to have.    \"Martha Honeydew,\" cried Hardingham with a smile, the first he had  sported that week, \"I am, as you know, a man of but few words, and  straight-forward in my dealings; say that you can fancy me, and I'll  marry you tomorrow.\"    Mrs. Honeydew's reply will be surmised; Caroline Dalton saw who was  preferred before her, and the bachelor's revenge ruined wild Tom; for  Hardingham settled all his property upon his wife, and a pretty life the  amiable creature led him.
