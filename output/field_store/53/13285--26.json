[5] But with reference to \"all the evidence directly affecting  either side of the question\" having been \"introduced and reviewed,\" I  must hold a different opinion. Believing, however, that Mr. Schroeder  has collected, presented and, with as much art as it will be found  possible to enlist in such a cause, sustained his special view of the  Spaulding theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon, one can but feel  that having reached the climax of evidence and argument the case should  be considered by those holding an opposite belief.    [Footnote 5: Mr. Schroeder while living in Utah some years ago was  proprietor, editor and publisher of _Lucifer's Lantern_, a ribald  infidel periodical as would be inferred from the title as well as from  its contents. It is this to which allusion is made in the text.]    PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.    One other preliminary word should be said before coming directly to  Mr. Schroeder's theory and argument, and that in relation to the  authorities on which the gentleman relies for the support of his views.  Of course I am not unacquainted with the old controversy concerning  the degree of credibility to be allowed to interested witnesses, and  also the suspicion that attaches to witnesses for the miraculous.  I have too long sustained in public debate an unpopular cause not  to have heard the cry that the witnesses for the truth for which I  contended were \"interested witnesses;\" notwithstanding those who were  my opponents, at the same time accepted Christianity on the testimony  of \"interested witnesses,\" and discarded entirely the testimony of  unfriendly witnesses, or \"interested witnesses\" on the opposite side of  the case. I trust that the suggestion in this paragraph will indicate  the unfairness of discrediting and discarding entirely the testimony of  the witnesses for Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of  Mormon, on the ground that they are \"interested witnesses,\" and taking  for truth the statements of the \"interested witnesses\" on the other  side of the controversy.    I have some acquaintance also with that school of thought which  discredits witnesses of the miraculous. I am familiar with the  laborious exposition of that theory by the late Professor Huxley in his  article on \"The Value of Witnesses to the Miraculous;\" [6] and also with  his controversy on the same subject with Dr. Henry Wace, prebendary of  St. Paul's Cathedral, and other Church of England ministers. [7] One  could scarcely live in this critical age of ours and be unaware of  the existence of the school of thought which undertakes to bar from  the court of public debate the testimony of those who are witnesses  of things held to \"transcend human experience.\" Such testimony, it is  said, suggests \"credulity on the one hand and fraud on the other.\" [8]    [Footnote 6: _The Nineteenth Century Review_, March, 1889.]    [Footnote 7: _The Nineteenth Century Review_, February, 1889; also  March, April, May and June of the same magazine.]    [Footnote 8: \"A supernatural relation cannot be accepted as such, * *  it always implies credulity or imposture,\" Renan's \"Life of Jesus,\"  introduction, p. 45.]    And still, both in the history of the past and now, witnesses of the  so-called miraculous are factors to be reckoned with in our world's  controversies.    It may be true that the future will disclose the fact that very much  which in the past has been regarded as miraculous, as transcending  \"all sane, human experience,\" to use a phrase of Mr. Schroeder's, is  only such because of human ignorance at the time of a witnessed event,  and that miracles only exist for the ignorant. Still I concede that  one needs to be upon his guard respecting this class of evidence, for  man's love for the marvelous leads him into strange self-deceptions,  as also the practice of deception upon others. But while conceding  this on the one hand, on the other I desire to call attention to  a matter entirely neglected by Mr. Schroeder, namely, the general  untrustworthiness of testimony in religious controversies, where those  considering themselves orthodox feel called upon to resist what are  supposed to be religious innovations. The truth of this is supported  by all ecclesiastical history. Even pious men, where the innovations  especially contravene particular doctrines or theories of established  institutions in which they are interested, often become utterly  unreliable as witnesses in matters where their opponents are concerned.    So universally is the fact here pointed out accepted that citations of  particular instances are scarcely necessary as proof. But lest others  forget the fact, as Mr. Schroeder apparently has forgotten it, let  me ask: Is Roman Catholic historical testimony regarded as reliable  where facts relating to Protestants and the Protestant movement are  concerned? Where does Martin Luther stand if the testimony of Catholic  contemporaries or the representations of Catholic historians are  to determine his place in history? A treatise upon the \"Protestant  Reformers\" and the value of the sixteenth century \"Reformation,\"  based wholly upon \"Bossuet's Variations,\" and other writers of his  kind, would not be regarded as of any special value among intelligent  people. And Catholics have fared but little better at the hands of  Protestants. The testimony of either party against the other is quite  generally regarded with suspicion by those who stand aloof from  their controversies, while the respective parties to the discussions  mutually denounce each other as false witnesses, until \"Catholic lie\"  and \"Protestant misrepresentation\" are cries and counter-cries that  echo and re-echo through all the pages of Catholic and, Protestant  controversial and historical literature.    But let us look further up the historic stream of sectarian animosity.  What of Jesus, the Son of God himself? If the sectarian Jews, his  contemporaries, are alone to be the accepted witnesses of his words  and actions and character, what would be the effect of their testimony  upon the historic Christ? It would make him base born, a wine bibber,  an associate of harlots, publicans and sinners; it would make him an  innovator of sacred customs, a desecrator of the temple, a seditious  person, a blasphemer. And so well did the sectaries of his day  succeed in making themselves believe that the populace of Jerusalem  surged through the streets crying \"crucify him, crucify him!\" and he  was condemned by the Sanhedrin to death, from which fate not even a  friendly disposed Roman procurator could save him. The sectarian Jews  suborned witnesses, who either swore falsely against the Christ, or  wrongly interpreted his words and actions; and all this in a holy zeal  for the preservation of the established order of things among the Jews.  After his resurrection the same characters bribed the Roman guard  set to watch the sepulchre, put a lie into their mouths, and pledged  their influence as a guarantee against punishment from their superior  officers for the neglect of duty involved in the falsehood they were  bribed to tell. [9] What was Paul's experience with the same sectarian  Jews after he became a proselyte to the Christian faith? Briefly told,  the same in character as his master's. [10] So well known is the fact of  sectarian bitterness; such the zeal of the orthodox for the established  faith, that the Emperor Julian, usually called the \"Apostate,\" who  both understood and derided the theological disputes of the hostile  Christian sects, invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile  sects, that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious  encounters.    [Footnote 9: Matthew xxvi, 59-70; see also xxvi, xxvii.]    [Footnote 10: See Acts of the Apostles from Chapters viii to xxvii,  inclusive.]        \"The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to      exclaim, 'Hear me! The Franks have heard me, and the Alemanni;' but      he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and      implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of oratory      to persuade them to live in concord, or at least in peace, he was      perfectly satisfied, before he dismissed them from his presence,      that he had nothing to dread from the union of the Christians.\" [11]    [Footnote 11: \"History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" by  Edward Gibbon, chap. xxiii.]    Such the bitterness of sectarian strife, in which the orthodox party  has ever been as harsh, as untruthful, as unscrupulous, as resourceful  at invention of evil things, as savage and cruel as the heretics have  been. Nay, in the sum of such things the preponderance is on their side.    VARIOUS CLASSES OF WITNESSES.    In the application of this melancholy fact to the controversy between  Christendom and the Mormon Church respecting the origin of the Book of  Mormon, let no one charge me with a begging of the question because  I am going to insist that the witnesses quoted by Mr. Schroeder are  largely unreliable, because of their zeal against an innovation of  orthodox Christianity. Not so. It is not my purpose to beg the question  by use of the historic fact here brought to view. I only ask that  it shall be given its proper value in weighing the evidence to be  considered. And I lay stress upon it only because it is an element in  the evidence adduced by Mr. Schroeder which is taken no account of at  all by him.    He gives no weight at all, considers not at all, the evidence of those  who have accepted Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#19)"],[1,"its greatness.        MICHELANGELO    Sometimes in a crowd of people one sees a tall man, who stands head and  shoulders higher than any one else, and who can look far over the heads  of ordinary-sized mortals.    'What a giant!' we exclaim, as we gaze up and see him towering above us.    So among the crowd of painters travelling along the road to Fame we see  above the rest a giant, a greater and more powerful genius than any  that came before or after him. When we hear the name of Michelangelo we  picture to ourselves a great rugged, powerful giant, a veritable son of  thunder, who, like the Titans of old, bent every force of Nature to his  will.    This Michelangelo was born at Caprese among the mountains of Casentino.  His father, Lodovico Buonarroti, was podesta or mayor of Caprese, and  came of a very ancient and honourable family, which had often  distinguished itself in the service of Florence.    Now the day on which the baby was born happened to be not only a  Sunday, but also a morning when the stars were especially favourable.  So the wise men declared that some heavenly virtue was sure to belong  to a child born at that particular time, and without hesitation  Lodovico determined to call his little son Michael Angelo, after the  archangel Michael. Surely that was a name splendid enough to adorn any  great career.    It happened just then that Lodovico's year of office ended, and so he  returned with his wife and child to Florence. He had a property at  Settignano, a little village just outside the city, and there he  settled down.    Most of the people of the village were stone-cutters, and it was to the  wife of one of these labourers that little Michelangelo was sent to be  nursed. So in after years the great master often said that if his mind  was worth anything, he owed it to the clear pure mountain air in which  he was born, just as he owed his love of carving stone to the  unconscious influence of his nurse, the stone-cutter's wife.    As the boy grew up he clearly showed in what direction his interest  lay. At school he was something of a dunce at his lessons, but let him  but have a pencil and paper and his mind was wide awake at once. Every  spare moment he spent making sketches on the walls of his father's  house.    But Lodovico would not hear of the boy becoming an artist. There were  many children to provide for, and the family was not rich. It would be  much more fitting that Michelangelo should go into the silk and woollen  business and learn to make money.    But it was all in vain to try to make the boy see the wisdom of all  this. Scold as they might, he cared for nothing but his pencil, and  even after he was severely beaten he would creep back to his beloved  work. How he envied his friend Francesco who worked in the shop of  Master Ghirlandaio! It was a joy even to sit and listen to the tales of  the studio, and it was a happy day when Francesco brought some of the  master's drawings to show to his eager friend.    Little by little Lodovico began to see that there was nothing for it  but to give way to the boy's wishes, and so at last, when he was  fourteen years old, Michelangelo was sent to study as a pupil in the  studio of Master Ghirlandaio.    It was just at the time when Ghirlandaio was painting the frescoes of  the chapel in Santa Maria Novella, and Michelangelo learned many  lessons as he watched the master at work, or even helped with the less  important parts.    But it was like placing an eagle in a hawk's nest. The young eagle  quickly learned to soar far higher than the hawk could do, and ere long  began to 'sweep the skies alone.'    It was not pleasant for the great Florentine master, whose work all men  admired, to have his drawings corrected by a young lad, and perhaps  Michelangelo was not as humble as he should have been. In the strength  of his great knowledge he would sometimes say sharp and scornful  things, and perhaps he forgot the respect due from pupil to master.    Be that as it may, he left Ghirlandaio's studio when he was sixteen  years old, and never had another master. Thenceforward he worked out  his own ideas in his giant strength, and was the pupil of none.    The boy Francesco was still his friend, and together they went to study  in the gardens of San Marco, where Lorenzo the Magnificent had  collected many statues and works of art. Here was a new field for  Michelangelo. Without needing a lesson he began to copy the statues in  terra-cotta, and so clever was his work that Lorenzo was delighted with  it.    'See, now, what thou canst do with marble,' he said. 'Terra-cotta is  but poor stuff to work in.'    Michelangelo had never handled a chisel before, but he chipped and cut  away the marble so marvellously that life seemed to spring out of the  stone. There was a marble head of an old faun in the garden, and this  Michelangelo set himself to copy. Such a wonderful copy did he make  that Lorenzo was amazed. It was even better than the original, for the  boy had introduced ideas of his own and had made the laughing mouth a  little open to show the teeth and the tongue of the faun. Lorenzo  noticed this, and turned with a smile to the young artist.    'Thou shouldst have remembered that old folks never keep all their  teeth, but that some of them are always wanting,' he said.    Of course Lorenzo meant this as a joke, but Michelangelo immediately  took his hammer and struck out several of the teeth, and this too  pleased Lorenzo greatly.    There was nothing that the Magnificent ruler loved so much as genius,  so Michelangelo was received into the palace and made the companion of  Lorenzo's sons. Not only did good fortune thus smile upon the young  artist, but to his great astonishment Lodovico too found that benefits  were showered upon him, all for the sake of his famous young son.    These years of peace, and calm, steady work had the greatest effect on  Michelangelo's work, and he learned much from the clever, brilliant men  who thronged Lorenzo's court. Then, too, he first listened to that  ringing voice which strove to raise Florence to a sense of her sins,  when Savonarola preached his great sermons in the Duomo. That teaching  sank deep into the heart of Michelangelo, and years afterwards he left  on the walls of the Sistine Chapel a living echo of those thundering  words.    Like all the other artists, he would often go to study Masaccio's  frescoes in the little chapel of the Carmine. There was quite a band of  young artists working there, and very soon they began to look with  envious feelings at Michelangelo's drawings, and their jealousy grew as  his fame increased. At last, one day, a youth called Torriggiano could  bear it no longer, and began to make scornful remarks, and worked  himself up into such a rage that he aimed a blow at Michelangelo with  his fist, which not only broke his nose but crushed it in such a way  that he was marked for life. He had had a rough, rugged look before  this, but now the crooked nose gave him almost a savage expression  which he never lost.    Changes followed fast after this time of quiet. Lorenzo the Magnificent  died, and his son, the weak Piero de Medici, tried to take his place as  ruler of Florence. For a time Michelangelo continued to live at the  court of Piero, but it was not encouraging to work for a master whose  foolish taste demanded statues to be made out of snow, which, of  course, melted at the first breath of spring.    Michelangelo never forgot all that he owed to Lorenzo, and he loved the  Medici family, but his sense of justice made him unable to take their  part when trouble arose between them and the Florentine people. So when  the struggle began he left Florence and went first to Venice and then  to Bologna. From afar he heard how the weak Piero had been driven out  of the city, but more bitter still was his grief when the news came  that the solemn warning voice of the great preacher Savonarola was  silenced for ever.    Then a great longing to see his beloved city again filled his heart,  and he returned to Florence.    Botticelli was a sad, broken-down old man now, and Ghirlandaio was also  growing old, but Florence was still rich in great artists. Leonardo da  Vinci, Perugino, and Filippino Lippi were all there, and men talked of  the coming of an even greater genius, the young Raphael of Urbino.    There happened just then to be at the works of the Cathedral of St.  Mary of the Flowers a huge block of marble which no one knew how to  use. Leonardo da Vinci had been invited to carve a statue out of it,  but he had refused to try, saying he could do nothing with it. But when  the marble was offered to Michelangelo his eye kindled and he stood for  a long time silent before the great white block. Through the outer  walls of stone he seemed to see the figure imprisoned in the marble,  and his giant strength and giant mind longed to go to work to set that  figure free.    And when the last covering of marble was chipped and cut away there  stood out a magnificent figure of the young David. Perhaps he is too  strong and powerful for our idea of the gentle shepherd-lad, but he is  a wonderful figure, and Goliath might well have trembled to meet such a  young giant.    People flocked to see the great statue, and many were the discussions  as to where it should be placed. Artists were never tired of giving  their opinion, and even of criticising the work. 'It seems to me,' said  one, 'that the nose is surely much too large for the face. Could you  not alter that?'    Michelangelo said nothing, but he mounted the scaffolding and pretended  to chip away at the nose with his chisel. Meanwhile he let drop some  marble chips and dust upon the head of the critic beneath. Then he came  down.    'Is that better?' he asked gravely.    'Admirable!' answered the artist. 'You have given it life.'    Michelangelo smiled to himself. How wise people thought themselves when  they often"]]]
