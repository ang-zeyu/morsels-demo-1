Quick, pack up!    THE ROBBERS. Where to? What?    CHARLES. Where to? Who asks that question? (Fiercely to SCHWEITZER)  Traitor, wouldst thou keep me back? But by the hope for heaven!    SCHWEITZER. I, a traitor? Lead on to hell and I will follow you!    CHARLES (falling on his neck). Dear brother! thou shalt follow me. She  weeps, she mourns away her life.

SCENE I.--Rural scenery in the neighborhood of              CHARLES VON MOOR'S castle.            CHARLES VON MOOR, KOSINSKY, at a distance.    CHARLES. Go forward, and announce me. You remember what you have to  say?    KOSINSKY. You are Count Brand, you come from Mecklenburg. I am your  groom. Do not fear, I shall take care to play my part. Farewell!                           [Exit.]    CHARLES. Hail to thee, Earth of my Fatherland (kisses the earth.)  Heaven of my Fatherland! Sun of my Fatherland! Ye meadows and hills,  ye streams and woods! Hail, hail to ye all! How deliciously the  breezes are wafted from my native hills? What streams of balmy perfume  greet the poor fugitive! Elysium! Realms of poetry! Stay, Moor, thy  foot has strayed into a holy temple. (Comes nearer.)    See there! the old swallow-nests in the castle yard!---and the little  garden-gate!--and this corner of the fence where I so often watched in  ambuscade to teaze old Towzer!--and down there in the green valley,  where, as the great Alexander, I led my Macedonians to the battle of  Arbela; and the grassy hillock yonder, from which I hurled the Persian  satrap--and then waved on high my victorious banner! (He smiles.) The  golden age of boyhood lives again in the soul of the outcast. I was  then so happy, so wholly, so cloudlessly happy--and now--behold all my  prospects a wreck! Here should I have presided, a great, a noble, an  honored man--here have--lived over again the years of boyhood in the  blooming--children of my Amelia--here!--here have been the idol of my  people--but the foul fiend opposed it (Starting.) Why am I here? To  feel like the captive when the clanking of his chains awakes him from  his dream of liberty. No, let me return to my wretchedness! The  captive had forgotten the light of day, but the dream of liberty flashes  past his eyes like a blaze of lightning in the night, which leaves it  darker than before. Farewell, ye native vales! once ye saw Charles as a  boy, and then Charles was happy. Now ye have seen the man his happiness  turned to despair! (He moves rapidly towards the most distant point of  the landscape, where he suddenly stops and casts a melancholy look  across to the castle.) Not to behold her! not even one look?--and only  a wall between me and Amelia! No! see her I must!--and him too!--though  it crush me! (He turns back.) Father! father! thy son approaches. Away  with thee, black, reeking gore! Away with that grim, ghastly look of  death! Oh, give me but this one hour free! Amelia! Father! thy  Charles approaches! (He goes quickly towards the castle.) Torment me  when the morning dawns--give me no rest with the coming night--beset me  in frightful dreams! But, oh! poison not this my only hour of bliss!  (He is standing at the gate.) What is it I feel? What means this, Moor?  Be a man! These death-like shudders--foreboding terrors.                              [Enters.]                  SCENE II.*--Gallery in the Castle.           *[In some editions this is the third scene,         and there is no second.]               Enter CHARLES VON MOOR, AMELIA.    AMELIA. And are you sure that you should know his portrait among these  pictures?    CHARLES. Oh, most certainly! his image has always been fresh in my  memory. (Passing along thee pictures.) This is not it.    AMELIA. You are right! He was the first count, and received his patent  of nobility from Frederic Barbarossa, to whom he rendered some service  against the corsairs.    CHARLES (still reviewing the pictures). Neither is it this--nor this--  nor that--it is not among these at all.    AMELIA. Nay! look more attentively! I thought you knew him.    CHARLES. As well as my own father! This picture wants the sweet  expression around the mouth, which distinguished him from among a  thousand. It is not he.    AMELIA. You surprise me. What! not seen him for eighteen years, and  still--    CHARLES (quickly, with a hectic blush). Yes, this is he! (He stands as  if struck by lightning.)    AMELIA. An excellent man!    CHARLES (absorbed in the contemplation of the picture). Father!  father! forgive me! Yes, an excellent man! (He wipes his eyes.) A  godlike man!    AMELIA. You seem to take a deep interest in him.    CHARLES. Oh, an excellent man! And he is gone, you say!    AMELIA. Gone! as our best joys perish. (Gently taking him by the  hand.) Dear Sir, no happiness ripens in this world.    CHARLES. Most true, most true! And have you already proved this truth  by sad experience? You, who can scarcely yet have seen your  twenty-third year?    AMELIA. Yes, alas, I have proved it. Whatever lives, lives to die in  sorrow. We engage our hearts, and grasp after the things of this world,  only to undergo the pang of losing them.    CHARLES. What can you have lost, and yet so young?    AMELIA. Nothing--everything--nothing. Shall we go on, count?*       *[In the acting edition is added--     \"MOOR. And would you learn forgetfulness in that holy garb there?     (Pointing to a nun's habit.)     \"AMELIA. To-morrow I hope to do so. Shall we continue our walk,     sir?\"]    CHARLES. In such haste? Whose portrait is that on the right? There is  an unhappy look about that countenance, methinks.    AMELIA. That portrait on the left is the son of the count, the present  count. Come, let us pass on!    CHARLES. But this portrait on the right?    AMELIA. Will you not continue your walk, Sir?    CHARLES. But this portrait on the right hand? You are in tears,  Amelia? [Exit AMELIA, in precipitation.]    CHARLES. She loves me, she loves me! Her whole being began to rebel,  and the traitor tears rolled down her cheeks. She loves me! Wretch,  hast thou deserved this at her hands? Stand I not here like a condemned  criminal before the fatal block? Is this the couch on which we so often  sat--where I have hung in rapture on her neck? Are these my ancestral  halls? (Overcome by the sight of his father's portrait.) Thou--thou--  Flames of fire darting from thine eyes--His curse--His curse--He disowns  me--Where am I? My sight grows dim--Horrors of the living God--'Twas I,  'twas I that killed my father!                          [He rushes off]             Enter FRANCIS VON MOOR, in deep thought.    FRANCIS. Away with that image! Away with it! Craven heart! Why dost  thou tremble, and before whom? Have I not felt, during the few hours  that the count has been within these walls as if a spy from hell were  gliding at my heels. Methinks I should know him! There is something so  lofty, so familiar, in his wild, sunburnt features, which makes me  tremble. Amelia, too, is not indifferent towards him! Does she not  dart eager, languishing looks at the fellow looks of which she is so  chary to all the world beside? Did I not see her drop those stealthy  tears into the wine, which, behind my back, he quaffed so eagerly that  he seemed to swallow the very glass? Yes, I saw it--I saw it in the  mirror with my own eyes. Take care, Francis! Look about you! Some  destruction-brooding monster is lurking beneath all this! (He stops,  with a searching look, before the portrait of CHARLES.)    His long, crane-like neck--his black, fire-sparkling eyes--hem! hem!--  his dark, overhanging, bushy eyebrows. (Suddenly starting back.)  Malicious hell! dost thou send me this suspicion? It is Charles! Yes,  all his features are reviving before me. It is he! despite his mask!  it is he! Death and damnation! (Goes up and down with agitated steps.)  Is it for this that I have sacrificed my nights--that I have mowed down  mountains and filled up chasms? For this that I have turned rebel  against all the instincts of humanity? To have this vagabond outcast  blunder in at last, and destroy all my cunningly devised fabric. But  gently! gently! What remains to be done is but child's play. Have I  not already waded up to my very ears in mortal sin? Seeing how far the  shore lies behind me, it would be madness to attempt to swim back. To  return is now out of the question. Grace itself would be beggared, and  infinite mercy become bankrupt, were they to be responsible for all my  liabilities. Then onward like a man. (He rings the bell.) Let him be  gathered to the spirit of his father, and now come on! For the dead I  care not! Daniel! Ho! Daniel! I'd wager a trifle they have already  inveigled him too into the plot against me! He looks so full of  mystery!                   Enter DANIEL.    DANIEL. What is your pleasure, my master?    FRANCIS. Nothing. Go, fill this goblet with wine, and quickly! (Exit  DANIEL.) Wait a little, old man! I shall find you out! I will fix my  eye upon you so keenly that your stricken conscience shall betray itself  through your mask! He shall die! He is but a sorry bungler who leaves  his work half finished, and then looks on idly, trusting to chance for  what may come of it.                Enter DANIEL, with the wine.    Bring it here! Look me steadfastly in the face! How your knees knock  together! How you tremble! Confess, old man! what have you been  doing?    DANIEL. Nothing, my honored master, by heaven and my poor soul!    FRANCIS. Drink this wine! What? you hesitate? Out with it quickly!  What have you put into the wine?    DANIEL. Heaven help me! What! I in the wine?    FRANCIS. You have poisoned it!

Know'st thou the empire's ban is out,--that thou  Art interdicted to thy friends, and given  An outlawed victim to thine enemies!    DUKE JOHN.  Therefore I shun all public thoroughfares,  And venture not to knock at any door--  I turn my footsteps to the wilds, and through  The mountains roam, a terror to myself.

The witness of my deed!    TELL.  The road you take lies through the river's gorge,  And many a cross proclaims where travellers  Have perished 'neath the avalanche's fall.    DUKE JOHN.  I have no fear for nature's terrors, so  I can appease the torments of my soul.    TELL.  At every cross kneel down and expiate  Your crime with burning penitential tears  And if you 'scape the perils of the pass,  And are not whelmed beneath the drifted snows  That from the frozen peaks come sweeping down,  You'll reach the bridge that hangs in drizzling spray;  Then if it yield not 'neath your heavy guilt,  When you have left it safely in your rear,  Before you frowns the gloomy Gate of Rocks,  Where never sun did shine.

A remarkable instance of this  occurred in the end of the thirteenth century, when Albert of Austria  became emperor, and when, possibly, for the first time, the bond was  reduced to writing. As it is important to the understanding of many  passages of the play, a translation is subjoined of the oldest known  document relating to it. The original, which is in Latin and German, is  dated in August, 1291, and is under the seals of the whole of the men of  Schwytz, the commonalty of the vale of Uri, and the whole of the men of  the upper and lower vales of Stanz.                  THE BOND.    Be it known to every one, that the men of the Dale of Uri, the Community  of Schwytz, as also the men of the mountains of Unterwald, in  consideration of the evil times, have full confidently bound themselves,  and sworn to help each other with all their power and might, property and  people, against all who shall do violence to them, or any of them. That  is our Ancient Bond.    Whoever hath a Seignior, let him obey according to the conditions of his  service.    We are agreed to receive into these dales no Judge who is not a  countryman and indweller, or who hath bought his place.    Every controversy amongst the sworn confederates shall be determined by  some of the sagest of their number, and if any one shall challenge their  judgment, then shall he be constrained to obey it by the rest.    Whoever intentionally or deceitfully kills another shall be executed, and  whoever shelters him shall be banished.    Whoever burns the property of another shall no longer be regarded as a  countryman, and whoever shelters him shall make good the damage done.    Whoever injures another, or robs him, and hath property in our country,  shall make satisfaction out of the same.    No one shall distrain a debtor without a judge, nor any one who is not  his debtor, or the surety for such debtor.    Every one in these dales shall submit to the judge, or we, the sworn  confederates, all will take satisfaction for all the injury occasioned by  his contumacy. And if in any internal division the one party will not  accept justice, all the rest shall help the other party. These decrees  shall, God willing, endure eternally for our general advantage.
