Wilberforce, Esq_.    \"I am much delighted with what I have seen and heard. I confess I  entertained doubts of the practicability of the Infant School System,  but these doubts have this day been removed. If in _one month_ so much  can be done, what might not be expected from further training? I now  doubt no longer, and anticipate from the extension of such schools a  vast improvement in the morals and religion of the humble classes. I  conclude with moving a vote of thanks to Mr. Wilderspin.\"--_Lord Chief  Justice Clerk_.    \"Sir John Sinclair, rose, and in addressing Mr. Wilderspin, said, that  he was astonished with the results of five weeks training in these  perfect infants. He had never seen a greater prodigy. He too had had  his prejudices--his doubts of the possibility of infant education;  but these doubts had now vanished, and for ever. The arrangements  for bodily exercise, connected with mental and moral improvement,  especially delighted him. He was amused as well as instructed by the  well-applied admixture of diverting expedients to keep the children  alive and alert. It was 'seria mixta jocis,' but there was practical  sense in the seemingly most frivolous part of the plan. He trusted  that the time was not far distant when there should be many such  institutions. He called on all present to join him in returning  cordial thanks to Mr. Wilderspin.\"--_Scotsman_.    \"The grand secret of the improvement found to be derived from these  establishments, is their constant tendency to remove evil example and  misery from the little creatures during almost the whole of their  waking hours. Consider how a child belonging to one of these passes  his day. As soon as he is up, the indispensable condition, and the  only one of his admission to the school, that of clean face and hands,  is enforced, and the mother, in order to be relieved of the care of  him during the, day, is obliged to have him washed. He then leaves the  abode of filth and intemperance, and squalid poverty, and ill-temper,  for a clean, airy place, pleasant in summer, warm and dry in winter;  and where he sees not a face that is not lighted up with the smile of  kindness towards him. His whole day is passed in amusing exercises, or  interesting instruction; and he returns at evening-tide fatigued and  ready for his bed, so that the scenes passing at his comfortless home  make a slight impression on his mind or on his spirits.\"--_Edinburgh  Review_.

Circumstances  made Frederick Douglass a slave, but they could not prevent him from  becoming a freeman and a leader among mankind.    The early life of Douglass, as detailed by himself from the platform  in vigorous and eloquent speech, and as recorded in the three volumes  written by himself at different periods of his career, is perhaps the  completest indictment of the slave system ever presented at the bar of  public opinion. Fanny Kemble's _Journal of a Residence on a Georgian  Plantation_, kept by her in the very year of Douglass's escape from  bondage, but not published until 1863, too late to contribute anything  to the downfall of slavery, is a singularly clear revelation of  plantation life from the standpoint of an outsider entirely unbiased  by American prejudice. _Frederick Douglass's Narrative_ is the same  story told from the inside. They coincide in the main facts; and in  the matter of detail, like the two slightly differing views of a  stereoscopic picture, they bring out into bold relief the real  character of the peculiar institution. _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ lent to  the structure of fact the decorations of humor, a dramatic plot, and  characters to whose fate the touch of creative genius gave a living  interest. But, after all, it was not Uncle Tom, nor Topsy, nor Miss  Ophelia, nor Eliza, nor little Eva that made the book the power it  proved to stir the hearts of men, but the great underlying tragedy  then already rapidly approaching a bloody climax.    Frederick Douglass was born in February, l8l7,--as nearly as the date  could be determined in after years, when it became a matter of public  interest,--at Tuckahoe, near Easton, Talbot County, on the eastern  shore of Maryland, a barren and poverty-stricken district, which  possesses in the birth of Douglass its sole title to distinction. His  mother was a negro slave, tall, erect, and well-proportioned, of a  deep black and glossy complexion, with regular features, and manners  of a natural dignity and sedateness. Though a field hand and compelled  to toil many hours a day, she had in some mysterious way learned to  read, being the only person of color in Tuckahoe, slave or free, who  possessed that accomplishment. His father was a white man. It was in  the nature of things that in after years attempts should be made to  analyze the sources of Douglass's talent, and that the question should  be raised whether he owed it to the black or the white half of his  mixed ancestry. But Douglass himself, who knew his own mother and  grandmother, ascribed such powers as he possessed to the negro half of  his blood; and, as to it certainly he owed the experience which gave  his anti-slavery work its peculiar distinction and value, he doubtless  believed it only fair that the credit for what he accomplished should  go to those who needed it most and could justly be proud of it. He  never knew with certainty who his white father was, for the exigencies  of slavery separated the boy from his mother before the subject of  his paternity became of interest to him; and in after years his white  father never claimed the honor, which might have given him a place in  history.    Douglass's earliest recollections centered around the cabin of his  grandmother, Betsey Bailey, who seems to have been something of a  privileged character on the plantation, being permitted to live with  her husband, Isaac, in a cabin of their own, charged with only the  relatively light duty of looking after a number of young children,  mostly the offspring of her own five daughters, and providing for her  own support.    It is impossible in a work of the scope of this to go into very  elaborate detail with reference to this period of Douglass's life,  however interesting it might be. The real importance of his life to us  of another generation lies in what he accomplished toward the world's  progress, which he only began to influence several years after his  escape from slavery. Enough ought to be stated, however, to trace  his development from slave to freeman, and his preparation for the  platform where he secured his hearing and earned his fame.    Douglass was born the slave of one Captain Aaron Anthony, a man of  some consequence in eastern Maryland, the manager or chief clerk of  one Colonel Lloyd, the head for that generation of an old, exceedingly  wealthy, and highly honored family in Maryland, the possessor of a  stately mansion and one of the largest and most fertile plantations in  the State. Captain Anthony, though only the satellite of this great  man, himself owned several farms and a number of slaves. At the age of  seven Douglass was taken from the cabin of his grandmother at Tuckahoe  to his masters residence on Colonel Lloyd's plantation.    Up to this time he had never, to his recollection, seen his mother.  All his impressions of her were derived from a few brief visits made  to him at Colonel Lloyd's plantation, most of them at night. These  fleeting visits of the mother were important events in the life of the  child, now no longer under the care of his grandmother, but turned  over to the tender mercies of his master's cook, with whom he does not  seem to have been a favorite. His mother died when he was eight or  nine years old. Her son did not see her during her illness, nor learn  of it until after her death. It was always a matter of grief to him  that he did not know her better, and that he could not was one of the  sins of slavery that he never forgave.    On Colonel Lloyd's plantation Douglass spent four years of the slave  life of which his graphic description on the platform stirred humane  hearts to righteous judgment of an unrighteous institution. It is  enough to say that this lad, with keen eyes and susceptible feelings,  was an eye-witness of all the evils to which slavery gave birth. Its  extremes of luxury and misery could be found within the limits of one  estate. He saw the field hand driven forth at dawn to labor until  dark. He beheld every natural affection crushed when inconsistent with  slavery, or warped and distorted to fit the necessities and promote  the interests of the institution. He heard the unmerited strokes of  the lash on the backs of others, and felt them on his own. In the wild  songs of the slaves he read, beneath their senseless jargon or their  fulsome praise of \"old master,\" the often unconscious note of grief  and despair. He perceived, too, the debasing effects of slavery upon  master and slave alike, crushing all semblance of manhood in the  one, and in the other substituting passion for judgment, caprice for  justice, and indolence and effeminacy for the more virile virtues of  freemen. Doubtless the gentle hand of time will some time spread  the veil of silence over this painful past; but, while we are still  gathering its evil aftermath, it is well enough that we do not forget  the origin of so many of our civic problems.    When Douglass was ten years old, he was sent from the Lloyd plantation  to Baltimore, to live with one Hugh Auld, a relative of his master.  Here he enjoyed the high privilege, for a slave, of living in the  house with his master's family. In the capacity of house boy it was  his duty to run errands and take care of a little white boy, Tommy  Auld, the son of his mistress for the time being, Mrs. Sophia Auld.  Mrs. Auld was of a religious turn of mind; and, from hearing her  reading the Bible aloud frequently, curiosity prompted the boy to ask  her to teach him to read. She complied, and found him an apt pupil,  until her husband learned of her unlawful and dangerous conduct, and  put an end to the instruction. But the evil was already done, and the  seed thus sown brought forth fruit in the after career of the orator  and leader of men. The mere fact that his master wished to prevent his  learning made him all the more eager to acquire knowledge. In after  years, even when most bitter in his denunciation of the palpable evils  of slavery, Douglass always acknowledged the debt he owed to this good  lady who innocently broke the laws and at the same time broke the  chains that held a mind in bondage.    Douglass lived in the family of Hugh Auld at Baltimore for seven  years. During this time the achievement that had the greatest  influence upon his future was his learning to read and write. His  mistress had given him a start. His own efforts gained the rest. He  carried in his pocket a blue-backed _Webster's Spelling Book_, and, as  occasion offered, induced his young white playmates, by the bribes  of childhood, to give him lessons in spelling. When he was about  thirteen, he began to feel deeply the moral yoke of slavery and to  seek for knowledge of the means to escape it. One book seems to have  had a marked influence upon his life at this epoch. He obtained,  somehow, a copy of _The Columbian Orator_, containing some of the  choicest masterpieces of English oratory, in which he saw liberty  praised and oppression condemned; and the glowing periods of Pitt and  Fox and Sheridan and our own Patrick Henry stirred to life in the  heart of this slave boy the genius for oratory which did not burst  forth until years afterward. The worldly wisdom of denying to slaves  the key to knowledge is apparent when it is said that Douglass first  learned from a newspaper that there were such people as abolitionists,  who were opposed to human bondage and sought to make all men free.  At about this same period Douglass's mind fell under religious  influences. He was converted, professed faith in Jesus Christ, and  began to read the Bible. He had dreamed of liberty before; he now  prayed for it, and trusted in God. But, with the shrewd common sense  which marked his whole life and saved it from shipwreck in more  than one instance, he never forgot that God helps them that help  themselves, and so never missed an opportunity to acquire the  knowledge that would prepare him for"]]]
