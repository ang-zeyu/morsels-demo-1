One night at dinner his lordship was toasted by an Indian  prince we had on board, and made a pleasant reply, although it  was plain to see that he was not an orator. Captain Preston,  the commander of the ship, who was afterward called upon, made  a much more brilliant speech.    The prince was Ranjitsinhji, a famous cricket player, whom some  consider the champion in that line of sport. He went over to  the United States with an English team and will be pleasantly  remembered at all the places he visited. He is a handsome fellow,  25 years old, about the color of a mulatto, with a slender athletic  figure, graceful manners, a pleasant smile, and a romantic history.  His father was ruler of one of the native states, and dying, left  his throne, title and estates to his eldest son. The latter,  being many years older than Ranjitsinhji, adopted him as his  heir and sent him to England to be educated for the important  duty he was destined to perform. He went through the school at  Harrow and Cambridge University and took honors in scholarship  as well as athletics, and was about to return to assume his  hereditary responsibility in Indian when, to the astonishment  of all concerned, a boy baby was born in his brother's harem,  the first and only child of a rajah 78 years of age. The mother  was a Mohammedan woman, and, according to a strict construction  of the laws governing such things among the Hindus, the child  was not entitled to any consideration whatever. Without going  into details, it is sufficient for the story to say that the  public at large did not believe that the old rajah was the father  of the child, or that the infant was entitled to succeed him  even if he had been. But the old man was so pleased at the birth  of the baby that he immediately proclaimed him his heir, the act  was confirmed by Lord Elgin, the viceroy, and the honors and  estates which Ranjitsinhji expected to inherit vanished like a  dream. The old man gave him an allowance of $10,000 a year and  he has since lived in London consoling himself with cricket.    Another distinguished passenger was Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney,  an Indian baronet, who inherited immense wealth from a long line  of Parsee bankers. They have adopted as a sort of trademark,  a nickname given by some wag to the founder of the family, in  the last century because of his immense fortune and success in  trade. Mr. Readymoney, or Sir Jehangir, as he is commonly known,  the present head of the house, was accompanied by his wife, two  daughters, their governess, and his son, who had been spending  several months in London, where he had been the object of much  gratifying attention. His father received his title as an  acknowledgment of his generosity in presenting $250,000 to the  Indian Institute in London, and for other public benefactions,  estimated at $1,300,000. He built colleges, hospitals, insane  asylums and other institutions. He founded a Strangers' Home  at Bombay for the refuge of people of respectability who find  themselves destitute or friendless or become ill in that city.  He erected drinking fountains of artistic architecture at several  convenient places in Bombay, and gave enormous sums to various  charities in London and elsewhere without respect to race or  creed. Both the Roman Catholic and the Presbyterian missions in  India have been the recipients of large gifts, and the university  at Bombay owes him for its finest building.    [Illustration: A BOMBAY STREET]    Several of the most prominent native families in India have followed  the example of Mr. Readymoney by adopting the nicknames that were  given their ancestors. Indian names are difficult to pronounce.  What, for example, would you call Mr. Jamshijdji or Mr. Jijibhai,  and those are comparatively simple? Hence, in early times it was  the habit of foreigners to call the natives with whom they came  in contact by names that were appropriate to their character or  their business. For example, \"Mr. Reporter,\" one of the editors  of the Times of India, as his father was before him, is known  honorably by a name given by people who were unable to pronounce  his father's Indian name.    Sir Jamsetjed Jeejeebhoy, one of the most prominent and wealthy  Parsees, who is known all over India for his integrity and  enterprise, and has given millions of dollars to colleges, schools,  hospitals, asylums and other charities, is commonly known as Mr.  Bottlewaller. \"Waller\" is the native word for trader, and his  grandfather was engaged in selling and manufacturing bottles. He  began by picking up empty soda and brandy bottles about the saloons,  clubs and hotels, and in that humble way laid the foundation of  an immense fortune and a reputation that any man might envy. The  family have always signed their letters and checks \"Bottlewaller,\"  and have been known by that name in business and society. But  when Queen Victoria made the grandfather a baronet because of  distinguished services, the title was conferred upon Jamsetjed  Jeejeebhoy, which was his lawful name.    Another similar case is that of the Petit family, one of the  richest in India and the owners and occupants of the finest palaces  in Bombay. Their ancestor, or the first of the family who  distinguished himself, was a man of very small stature, almost  a dwarf, who was known as Le Petit. He accepted the christening  and bore the name honorably, as his sons and grandsons have since  done. They are now baronets, but have never dropped it, and the  present head of the house is Sir Manockji Petit.    The Eye of India, as Bombay is called, sits on an island facing  the Arabian Sea on one side and a large bay on the other, but the  water is quite shallow, except where channels have been dredged  to the docks. The scenery is not attractive. Low hills rise in  a semicircle from the horizon, half concealed by a curtain of  mist, and a few green islands scattered about promiscuously are  occupied by hospitals, military barracks, villas and plantations.  Nor is the harbor impressive. It is not worth description, but  the pile of buildings which rises on the city side as the steamer  approaches its dock is imposing, being a picturesque mingling  of oriental and European architecture. Indeed, I do not know of  any city that presents a braver front to those who arrive by sea.  At the upper end, which you see first, is a group of five-story  apartment houses, with oriental balconies and colonnades. Then  comes a monstrous new hotel, built by a stock company under the  direction of the late J. N. Tata, a Parsee merchant who visited  the United States several times and obtained his inspirations  and many of his ideas there. Beside the hotel rise the buildings  of the yacht club, a hospitable association of Englishmen, to  which natives, no matter how great and good they may be, are  never admitted. Connected with the club is an apartment house  for gentlemen, and so hospitable are the members that a traveler  can secure quarters there without difficulty if he brings a letter  of introduction.    Next toward the docks is an old castle whose gray and lichen-covered  walls are a striking contrast to the new modern buildings that  surround it. These walls inclose a considerable area, which by  courtesy is called a fort. It was a formidable defense at one  time, and has been the scene of much exciting history, but is  obsolete now. The walls are of heavy masonry, but a shot from  a modern gun would shatter them. They inclose the military  headquarters of the Bombay province, or Presidency, as it is  called in the Indian gazetteer, the cathedral of this diocese,  quarters and barracks for the garrison, an arsenal, magazines  and other military buildings and a palatial sailors' home, one  of the finest and largest institution of the kind in the world,  which is supported by contributions from the various shipping  companies that patronize this place. There are also several machine  shops, factories and warehouses which contain vast stores of  war material of every sort sufficient to equip an army at a  fortnight's notice. About twelve hundred men are constantly employed  in the arsenal and shops making and repairing military arms and  equipments. There is a museum of ancient weapons, and many which  were captured from the natives in the early days of India's  occupation are quite curious; and there the visitor will have  his first view of one of the greatest wonders of nature, a banyan  tree, which drops its branches to take root in the soil beneath  its over-spreading boughs. But you must wait until you get to  Calcutta before you can see the best specimens.    Bombay is not fortified, except by a few guns behind some earthworks  at the entrance of the harbor, but it must be if the Russians  secure a port upon the Arabian Sea; not only Bombay, but the  entire west coast of India. The only protection for the city  now is a small fleet of battle ships, monitors and gunboats that  lie in the harbor, and there are usually several visiting men  of war at the anchorage.    Bombay is the second city in population in India, Calcutta standing  first on the list with 1,350,000 people, and, if you will take  your map for a moment, you will see that the two cities lie in  almost the same latitude, one on each side of the monstrous  peninsula--Bombay at the top of the Arabian Sea and Calcutta at  the top of the Bay of Bengal. By the census of 1891 Bombay had  821,764 population. By the census of 1901 the total was 776,006,  the decrease of 45,758 being attributed to the frightful mortality  by the plague in 1900 and 1901. It is the most enterprising, the  most modern, the most active, the richest and the most prosperous  city in India.

There is a larger meaning of the word proof, in which this  question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of  philosophy. The subject is within the cognizance of the rational  faculty; and neither does that faculty deal with it solely in the way  of intuition. Considerations may be presented capable of determining the  intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine; and  this is equivalent to proof.    We shall examine presently of what nature are these considerations; in  what manner they apply to the case, and what rational grounds,  therefore, can be given for accepting or rejecting the utilitarian  formula. But it is a preliminary condition of rational acceptance or  rejection, that the formula should be correctly understood. I believe  that the very imperfect notion ordinarily formed of its meaning, is the  chief obstacle which impedes its reception; and that could it be  cleared, even from only the grosser misconceptions, the question would  be greatly simplified, and a large proportion of its difficulties  removed. Before, therefore, I attempt to enter into the philosophical  grounds which can be given for assenting to the utilitarian standard, I  shall offer some illustrations of the doctrine itself; with the view of  showing more clearly what it is, distinguishing it from what it is not,  and disposing of such of the practical objections to it as either  originate in, or are closely connected with, mistaken interpretations of  its meaning. Having thus prepared the ground, I shall afterwards  endeavour to throw such light as I can upon the question, considered as  one of philosophical theory.          CHAPTER II.      WHAT UTILITARIANISM IS.    A passing remark is all that needs be given to the ignorant blunder of  supposing that those who stand up for utility as the test of right and  wrong, use the term in that restricted and merely colloquial sense in  which utility is opposed to pleasure. An apology is due to the  philosophical opponents of utilitarianism, for even the momentary  appearance of confounding them with any one capable of so absurd a  misconception; which is the more extraordinary, inasmuch as the contrary  accusation, of referring everything to pleasure, and that too in its  grossest form, is another of the common charges against utilitarianism:  and, as has been pointedly remarked by an able writer, the same sort of  persons, and often the very same persons, denounce the theory \"as  impracticably dry when the word utility precedes the word pleasure, and  as too practicably voluptuous when the word pleasure precedes the word  utility.\" Those who know anything about the matter are aware that every  writer, from Epicurus to Bentham, who maintained the theory of utility,  meant by it, not something to be contradistinguished from pleasure, but  pleasure itself, together with exemption from pain; and instead of  opposing the useful to the agreeable or the ornamental, have always  declared that the useful means these, among other things. Yet the  common herd, including the herd of writers, not only in newspapers and  periodicals, but in books of weight and pretension, are perpetually  falling into this shallow mistake. Having caught up the word  utilitarian, while knowing nothing whatever about it but its sound, they  habitually express by it the rejection, or the neglect, of pleasure in  some of its forms; of beauty, of ornament, or of amusement. Nor is the  term thus ignorantly misapplied solely in disparagement, but  occasionally in compliment; as though it implied superiority to  frivolity and the mere pleasures of the moment. And this perverted use  is the only one in which the word is popularly known, and the one from  which the new generation are acquiring their sole notion of its meaning.  Those who introduced the word, but who had for many years discontinued  it as a distinctive appellation, may well feel themselves called upon to  resume it, if by doing so they can hope to contribute anything towards  rescuing it from this utter degradation.[A]    The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the  Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion  as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the  reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the  absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure. To  give a clear view of the moral standard set up by the theory, much more  requires to be said; in particular, what things it includes in the ideas  of pain and pleasure; and to what extent this is left an open question.  But these supplementary explanations do not affect the theory of life on  which this theory of morality is grounded--namely, that pleasure, and  freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all  desirable things (which are as numerous in the utilitarian as in any  other scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in  themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention  of pain.    Now, such a theory of life excites in many minds, and among them in some  of the most estimable in feeling and purpose, inveterate dislike. To  suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than  pleasure--no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit--they  designate as utterly mean and grovelling; as a doctrine worthy only of  swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were, at a very early period,  contemptuously likened; and modern holders of the doctrine are  occasionally made the subject of equally polite comparisons by its  German, French, and English assailants.    When thus attacked, the Epicureans have always answered, that it is not  they, but their accusers, who represent human nature in a degrading  light; since the accusation supposes human beings to be capable of no  pleasures except those of which swine are capable. If this supposition  were true, the charge could not be gainsaid, but would then be no  longer an imputation; for if the sources of pleasure were precisely the  same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough  for the one would be good enough for the other. The comparison of the  Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading, precisely because  a beast's pleasures do not satisfy a human being's conceptions of  happiness. Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal  appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything  as happiness which does not include their gratification. I do not,  indeed, consider the Epicureans to have been by any means faultless in  drawing out their scheme of consequences from the utilitarian principle.  To do this in any sufficient manner, many Stoic, as well as Christian  elements require to be included. But there is no known Epicurean theory  of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect; of the  feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments, a much higher  value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation. It must be admitted,  however, that utilitarian writers in general have placed the superiority  of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency,  safety, uncostliness, &c., of the former--that is, in their  circumstantial advantages rather than in their intrinsic nature. And on  all these points utilitarians have fully proved their case; but they  might have taken the other, and, as it may be called, higher ground,  with entire consistency. It is quite compatible with the principle of  utility to recognise the fact, that some _kinds_ of pleasure are more  desirable and more valuable than others. It would be absurd that while,  in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as  quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on  quantity alone.    If I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or  what makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a  pleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible  answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who  have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any  feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable  pleasure. If one of the two is, by those who are competently acquainted  with both, placed so far above the other that they prefer it, even  though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent,  and would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which  their nature is capable of, we are justified in ascribing to the  preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing  quantity as to render it, in comparison, of small account.    Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted  with, and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying, both, do give a  most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their  higher faculties. Few human creatures would consent to be changed into  any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a  beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a  fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling  and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be  persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied  with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign what they  possess more than he, for the most complete satisfaction of all the  desires which they have in common with him. If they ever fancy they  would, it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme, that to escape  from it they would exchange their lot for almost any other, however  undesirable in their own eyes. A being of higher faculties requires more  to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and is  certainly"]]]
