Champlain and his allies pursued  them a mile and a half, or to the first fall in the little stream that  connects Lake Champlain [62] and Lake George. [63] The victory was  complete. The allies gathered at the scene of conflict, danced and sang in  triumph, collected and appropriated the abandoned armor, feasted on the  provisions left by the Iroquois, and, within three hours, with ten or  twelve prisoners, were sailing down the lake on their homeward voyage.    After they had rowed about eight leagues, according to Champlain's  estimate, they encamped for the night. A prevailing characteristic of the  savages on the eastern coast, in the early history of America, was the  barbarous cruelties which they inflicted upon their prisoners of war. [64]  They did not depart from their usual custom in the present instance. Having  kindled a fire, they selected a victim, and proceeded to excoriate his back  with red-hot burning brands, and to apply live coals to the ends of his  fingers, where they would give the most exquisite pain. They tore out his  finger-nails, and, with sharp slivers of wood, pierced his wrists and  rudely forced out the quivering sinews. They flayed off the skin from the  top of his head, [65] and poured upon the bleeding wound a stream of  boiling melted gum. Champlain remonstrated in vain. The piteous cries of  the poor, tormented victim excited his unavailing compassion, and he turned  away in anger and disgust. At length, when these inhuman tortures had been  carried as far as they desired, Champlain was permitted, at his earnest  request, with a musket-shot to put an end to his sufferings. But this was  not the termination of the horrid performance. The dead victim was hacked  in pieces, his heart severed into parts, and the surviving prisoners were  ordered to eat it. This was too revolting to their nature, degraded as it  was; they were forced, however, to take it into their mouths, but they  would do no more, and their guard of more compassionate Algonquins allowed  them to cast it into the lake.    This exhibition of savage cruelty was not extraordinary, but according to  their usual custom. It was equalled, and, if possible, even surpassed, in  the treatment of captives generally, and especially of the Jesuit  missionaries in after years. [66]    When the party arrived at the Falls of Chambly, the Hurons and Algonquins  left the river, in order to reach their homes by a shorter way,  transporting their canoes and effects over land to the St. Lawrence near  Montreal, while the rest continued their journey down the Richelieu and the  St. Lawrence to Tadoussac, where their families were encamped, waiting to  join in the usual ceremonies and rejoicings after a great victory.    When the returning warriors approached Tadoussac, they hung aloft on the  prow of their canoes the scalped heads of those whom they had slain,  decorated with beads which they had begged from the French for this  purpose, and with a savage grace presented these ghastly trophies to their  wives and daughters, who, laying aside their garments, eagerly swam out to  obtain the precious mementoes, which they hung about their necks and bore  rejoicing to the shore, where they further testified their satisfaction by  dancing and singing.    After a few days, Champlain repaired to Quebec, and early in September  decided to return with Pont Grave to France. All arrangements were speedily  made for that purpose. Fifteen men were left to pass the winter at Quebec,  in charge of Captain Pierre Chavin of Dieppe. On the 5th of September they  sailed from Tadoussac, and, lingering some days at Isle Perce, arrived at  Honfleur on the 13th of October, 1609.    Champlain hastened immediately to Fontainebleau, to make a detailed report  of his proceedings to Sieur de Monts, who was there in official attendance  upon the king. [67] On this occasion he sought an audience also with Henry  IV., who had been his friend and patron from the time of his first voyage  to Canada in 1603. In addition to the new discoveries and observations  which he detailed to him, he exhibited a belt curiously wrought and inlaid  with porcupine-quills, the work of the savages, which especially drew forth  the king's admiration. He also presented two specimens of the scarlet  tanager, _Pyranga rubra_, a bird of great brilliancy of plumage and  peculiar to this continent, and likewise the head of a gar-pike, a fish of  singular characteristics, then known only in the waters of Lake Champlain.  [68]    At this time De Monts was urgently seeking a renewal of his commission for  the monopoly of the fur-trade. In this Champlain was deeply interested. But  to this monopoly a powerful opposition arose, and all efforts at renewal  proved utterly fruitless. De Monts did not, however, abandon the enterprise  on which he had entered. Renewing his engagements with the merchants of  Rouen with whom he had already been associated, he resolved to send out in  the early spring, as a private enterprise and without any special  privileges or monopoly, two vessels with the necessary equipments for  strengthening his colony at Quebec and for carrying on trade as usual with  the Indians.    Champlain was again appointed lieutenant, charged with the government and  management of the colony, with the expectation of passing the next winter  at Quebec, while Pont Grave, as he had been before, was specially entrusted  with the commercial department of the expedition.    They embarked at Honfleur, but were detained in the English Channel by bad  weather for some days. In the mean time Champlain was taken seriously ill,  the vessel needed additional ballast, and returned to port, and they did  not finally put to sea till the 8th of April. They arrived at Tadoussac on  the 26th of the same month, in the year 1610, and, two days later, sailed  for Quebec, where they found the commander, Captain Chavin, and the little  colony all in excellent health.    The establishment at Quebec, it is to be remembered, was now a private  enterprise. It existed by no chartered rights, it was protected by no  exclusive authority. There was consequently little encouragement for its  enlargement beyond what was necessary as a base of commercial operations.  The limited cares of the colony left, therefore, to Champlain, a larger  scope for the exercise of his indomitable desire for exploration and  adventure. Explorations could not, however, be carried forward without the  concurrence and guidance of the savages by whom he was immediately  surrounded. Friendly relations existed between the French and the united  tribes of Montagnais, Hurons, and Algonquins, who occupied the northern  shores of the St. Lawrence and the great lakes. A burning hatred existed  between these tribes and the Iroquois, occupying the southern shores of the  same river. A deadly warfare was their chief employment, and every summer  each party was engaged either in repelling an invasion or in making one in  the territory of the other. Those friendly to Champlain were quite ready to  act as pioneers in his explorations and discoveries, but they expected and  demanded in return that he should give them active personal assistance in  their wars. Influenced, doubtless, by policy, the spirit of the age, and  his early education in the civil conflicts of France, Champlain did not  hesitate to enter into an alliance and an exchange of services on these  terms.    In the preceding year, two journeys into distant regions had been planned  for exploration and discovery. One beginning at Three Rivers, was to  survey, under the guidance of the Montagnais, the river St. Maurice to its  source, and thence, by different channels and portages, reach Lake St.  John, returning by the Saguenay, making in the circuit a distance of not  less than eight hundred miles. The other plan was to explore, under the  direction of the Hurons and Algonquins, the vast country over which they  were accustomed to roam, passing up the Ottawa, and reaching in the end the  region of the copper mines on Lake Superior, a journey not less than twice  the extent of the former.    Neither of these explorations could be undertaken the present year. Their  importance, however, to the future progress of colonization in New France  is sufficiently obvious. The purpose of making these surveys shows the  breadth and wisdom of Champlain's views, and that hardships or dangers were  not permitted to interfere with his patriotic sense of duty.    Soon after his arrival at Quebec, the savages began to assemble to engage  in their usual summer's entertainment of making war upon the Iroquois.  Sixty Montagnais, equipped in their rude armor, were hastening to the  rendezvous which, by agreement made the year before, was to be at the mouth  of the Richelieu. [69] Hither were to come the three allied tribes, and  pass together up this river into Lake Champlain, the \"gate\" or war-path  through which these hostile clans were accustomed to make their yearly  pilgrimage to meet each other in deadly conflict. Sending forward four  barques for trading purposes, Champlain repaired to the mouth of the  Richelieu, and landed, in company with the Montagnais, on the Island St.  Ignace, on the 19th of June. While preparations were making to receive  their Algonquin allies from the region of the Ottawa, news came that they  had already arrived, and that they had discovered a hundred Iroquois  strongly barricaded in a log fort, which they had hastily thrown together  on the brink of the river not far distant, and to capture them the  assistance of all parties was needed without delay. Champlain, with four  Frenchmen and the sixty Montagnais, left the island in haste, passed over  to the mainland, where they left their canoes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#19)"],[1,"saved his royal majesty.\"          CHAPTER VIII.    THE KING'S ESCAPE TO FRANCE.        When the king and Carlis came into the house again, on the evening  after their wearisome day's confinement in the tree, Dame Penderel had  some chickens prepared for his majesty's supper, which he enjoyed as  a great and unexpected luxury. They showed him, too, the hiding hole,  built in the walls, where the Earl of Derby had been concealed, and  where they proposed that he should be lodged for the night. There was  room in it to lay down a small straw pallet for a bed. The king thought  it would be very secure, and was confirmed in his determination not  to go again to the oak. Before his majesty retired, Carlis asked him  what he would like to have to eat on the morrow. He said that he should  like some mutton. Carlis assented, and, bidding his master good night,  he left him to his repose.    There was no mutton in the house, and Richard and William both agreed  that it would be unsafe for either of them to procure any, since, as  they were not accustomed to purchase such food, their doing so now  would awaken suspicion that they had some unusual guest to provide  for. The colonel, accordingly, undertook himself to obtain the supply.    Getting the necessary directions, therefore, from Richard and William,  he went to the house of a farmer at some little distance--a tenant,  he was, on the Boscobel estate--and groped his way to the sheep-cote.  He selected an animal, such as he thought suitable for his purpose,  and butchered it with his dagger. He then went back to the house, and  sent William Penderel to bring the plunder home. William dressed a leg  of the mutton, and sent it in the morning into the room which they had  assigned to the king, near his hiding hole. The king was overjoyed at  the prospect of this feast He called for a carving knife and a frying  pan. He cut off some callops from the joint, and then, after frying  the meat with Carlis's assistance, they ate it together.    The king, becoming now somewhat accustomed to his situation, began to  grow a little more bold. He walked in a little gallery which opened  from his room. There was a window in this gallery which commanded a  view of the road. The king kept watch carefully at this window as he  walked to and fro, that he might observe the first appearance of any  enemy's approach. It was observed, too, that he apparently spent some  time here in exercises of devotion, imploring, probably, the protection  of Heaven, in this his hour of danger and distress. The vows and  promises which he doubtless made were, however, all forgotten, as usual  in such cases, when safety and prosperity came again.    There was a little garden, too, near the house, with an eminence at  the further end of it, where there was an arbor, with a stone table,  and seats about it. It was retired, and yet, being in an elevated  position, it answered, like the window of the gallery in the house,  the double purpose of a hiding place and a watch tower. It was far  more comfortable, and probably much more safe, than the wretched nest  in the tree of the day before; for, were the king discovered in the  arbor, there would be some chances of escape from detection still  remaining, but to have been found in the tree would have been certain  destruction.    In the mean time, the Penderels had had messengers out during the  Saturday and Sunday, communicating with certain known friends of the  king in the neighboring towns, and endeavoring to concert some plan  for his escape. They were successful in these consultations, and be  fore Sunday night a plan was formed. It seems there was a certain  Colonel Lane, whose wife had obtained a pass from the authorities of  the Republican army to go to Bristol, on the occasion of the sickness  of a relative, and to take with her a man servant. Bristol was a hundred  miles to the southward, near the mouth of the Severn. It was thought  that if the king should reach this place, he could, perhaps, succeed  afterward in making his way to the southern coast of England, and  embarking there, at some sea-port, for France. The plan was accordingly  formed for Mrs. Lane to go, as she had designed, on this journey, and  to take the king along with her in the guise of her servant. The  arrangements were all made, and the king was to be met in a wood five  or six miles from Boscobel, early on Monday morning, by some trusty  friends, who were afterward to conceal him for a time in their houses,  until all things should be ready for the journey.    The king found, however, when the morning approached, that his feet  were in such a condition that he could not walk. They accordingly  procured a horse belonging to one of the Penderels, and put him upon  it. The brothers all accompanied him as he went away. They were armed  with concealed weapons, intending, if they we're attacked by any small  party, to defend the king with their lives. They, however, went on  without any molestation. It was a dark and rainy night. Nights are  seldom otherwise in England in September. The brothers Penderel, six  of them in all, guided the king along through the darkness and rain,  until they were within a mile or two of the appointed place of meeting,  where the king dismounted, for the purpose of walking the rest of way,  for greater safety, and three of the brothers, taking the horse with  them, returned. The rest went on, and, after delivering the king safely  into the hands of his friends, who were waiting at the appointed place  to receive him, bade his majesty farewell, and, expressing their good  wishes for the safe accomplishment of his escape, they returned to  Boscobel.    They now altered the king's disguise in some degree, to accommodate  the change in his assumed character from that of a peasant of the woods  to a respectable farmer's son, such as would be a suitable traveling  attendant for an English dame, and they gave him the new name of William  Jackson in the place of Will Jones. Mrs. Lane's sister's husband was  to go with them a part of the way, and there was another gentleman and  lady also of the party, so they were five in all. The horses were  brought to the door when all was ready, just in the edge of the evening,  the pretended attendant standing respectfully by, with his hat under  his arm. He was to ride upon the same horse with Mrs. Lane, the lady  being seated on a pillion behind him. The family assembled to bid the  party farewell, none, either of the travelers or of the spectators,  except Mrs. Lane and her brother-in-law, having any idea that the meek  looking William Jackson was any other than what he seemed.    They traveled on day after day, meeting with various adventures, and  apparently with narrow escapes. At one time a shoe was off from the  horse's foot, and the king stopped at a blacksmith's to have it  replaced. While the smith was busy at the work, the king, standing by,  asked him what news. \"No news,\" said the smith, \"that I know of, since  the grand news of beating the rogues, the Scots, at Worcester.\" The  king asked if any of the English officers who were with the Scots had  been taken since the battle. \"Some had been captured,\" the smith  replied, \"but he could not learn that the rogue Charles Stuart had  been taken.\" The king then told him that if that rogue were taken, he  deserved to be hanged more than all the rest, for bringing the Scots  in. \"You speak like an honest man,\" said the smith. Soon after, the  work was done, and Charles led the horse away.    At another time, when the party had stopped for the night, the king,  in accordance with his assumed character, went to the kitchen. They  were roasting some meat with a jack, a machine used much in those days  to keep meat, while roasting, in slow rotation before the fire, The  jack had run down. They asked the pretended William Jackson to wind  it up. In trying to do it, he attempted to wind it the wrong way. The  cook, in ridiculing, his awkwardness, asked him what country he came  from, that he did not know how to wind up a jack. The king meekly  replied that he was the son of a poor tenant of Colonel Lane's, and  that they seldom had meat to roast at home, and that, when they had  it, they did not roast it with a jack. The party at length arrived  safely at their place of destination, which was at the house of a Mrs.  Norton, at a place called Leigh, about three miles from Bristol. Here  the whole party were received, and, in order to seclude the king as  much as possible from observation, Mrs. Lane pretended that he was in  very feeble health, and he was, accordingly, a good deal confined to  his room. The disease which they selected for him was an intermittent  fever, which came on only at intervals. This would account for his  being sometimes apparently pretty well, and allowed him occasionally,  when tired of being shut up in his room, to come down and join the  other servants, and hear their conversation.    There was an old servant of the family, named Pope, a butler, to whose  care the pretended William Jackson was specially confided. On the  following morning after his arrival, Charles, feeling, notwithstanding  his fever, a good appetite after the fatigues of his journey, went  down to get his breakfast, and, while there, some men came in, friends  of the servants, and Pope brought out a luncheon of bread and ale, and  placed it before them. While they were eating it, they began to talk  about the battle of Worcester, and one of the men described it so  accurately, that the king perceived that he must have been there. On  questioning him more particularly, the man said that he was a soldier  in the king's army, and he began to describe the person and appearance  of the king. Charles was alarmed, and very soon rose and went away.  Pope, who had had, it seems, his suspicions before, was now confirmed  in them. He went to Mrs. Lane, and told her that he knew"]]]
