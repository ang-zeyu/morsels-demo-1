The subject  of the contest gives it a further interest. It was the youthful wife of  the youthful Caesar who stood under the shadow of the great Dictator's  displeasure; not personally, but politically, on account of her  connexions: and her it was, Cornelia, the daughter of a man who had been  four times consul, that Caesar was required to divorce: but he spurned  the haughty mandate, and carried his determination to a triumphant  issue, notwithstanding his life was at stake, and at one time saved only  by shifting his place of concealment every night; and this young lady it  was who afterwards became the mother of his only daughter. Both mother  and daughter, it is remarkable, perished prematurely, and at critical  periods of Caesar's life; for it is probable enough that these  irreparable wounds to Caesar's domestic affections threw him with more  exclusiveness of devotion upon the fascinations of glory and ambition  than might have happened under a happier condition of his private life.  That Caesar should have escaped destruction in this unequal contest with  an enemy then wielding the whole thunders of the state, is somewhat  surprising; and historians have sought their solution of the mystery in  the powerful intercessions of the vestal virgins, and several others of  high rank amongst the connexions of his great house. These may have done  something; but it is due to Sylla, who had a sympathy with everything  truly noble, to suppose him struck with powerful admiration for the  audacity of the young patrician, standing out in such severe solitude  among so many examples of timid concession; and that to this magnanimous  feeling in the Dictator much of the indulgence which he showed may have  been really due. In fact, according to some accounts, it was not Sylla,  but the creatures of Sylla (_adjutores_), who pursued Caesar. We know,  at all events, that Sylla formed a right estimate of Caesar's character,  and that, from the complexion of his conduct in this one instance, he  drew that famous prophecy of his future destiny; bidding his friends  beware of that slipshod boy, \"for that in him lay couchant many a  Marius.\" A grander testimony to the awe which Caesar inspired, or from  one who knew better the qualities of that Cyclopean man by whose scale  he measured the patrician boy, cannot be imagined.    It is not our intention, or consistent with our plan, to pursue this  great man through the whole circumstances of his romantic career; though  it is certain that many parts of his life require investigation much  keener than has ever been applied to them, and that many might be placed  in a new light. Indeed, the whole of this most momentous section of  ancient history ought to be recomposed with the critical scepticism of a  Niebuhr, and the same comprehensive collation, resting, if possible, on  the felicitous interpretation of authorities. In reality it is the hinge  upon which turned the future destiny of the whole earth, and, having  therefore a common relation to all modern nations whatsoever, should  naturally have been cultivated with the zeal which belongs to a personal  concern. In general, the anecdotes which express most vividly the  grandeur of character in the first Caesar are those which illustrate his  defiance of danger in extremity: the prodigious energy and rapidity of  his decisions and motions in the field (looking to which it was that  Cicero called him [Greek: teras] or portentous revelation); the skill  with which he penetrated the designs of his enemies, and the electric  speed with which he met disasters with remedy and reparation, or, where  that was impossible, with relief; the extraordinary presence of mind  which he showed in turning adverse omens to his own advantage, as when,  upon stumbling in coming on shore (which was esteemed a capital omen of  evil), he transfigured as it were in one instant its whole meaning by  exclaiming, \"Thus, and by this contact with the earth, do I take  possession of thee, O Africa!\" in that way giving to an accident the  semblance of a symbolic purpose. Equally conspicuous was the grandeur of  fortitude with which he faced the whole extent of a calamity when  palliation could do no good, \"non negando, minuendove, sed insuper  amplificando, _ementiendoque_\"; as when, upon finding his soldiery  alarmed at the approach of Juba, with forces really great, but  exaggerated by their terrors, he addressed them in a military harangue  to the following effect:--\"Know that within a few days the king will  come up with us, bringing with him sixty thousand legionaries, thirty  thousand cavalry, one hundred thousand light troops, besides three  hundred elephants. Such being the case, let me hear no more of  conjectures and opinions, for you have now my warrant for the fact,  whose information is past doubting. Therefore, be satisfied; otherwise,  I will put every man of you on board some crazy old fleet, and whistle  you down the tide--no matter under what winds, no matter towards what  shore.\" Finally, we might seek for _characteristic_ anecdotes of Caesar  in his unexampled liberalities and contempt of money.    Upon this last topic it is the just remark of Casaubon that some  instances of Caesar's munificence have been thought apocryphal, or to  rest upon false readings, simply from ignorance of the heroic scale upon  which the Roman splendours of that age proceeded. A forum which Caesar  built out of the products of his last campaign, by way of a present to  the Roman people, cost him--for the ground merely on which it stood--  nearly eight hundred thousand pounds. To the citizens of Rome he  presented, in one _congiary_, about two guineas and a half a head. To  his army, in one _donation_, upon the termination of the Civil War, he  gave a sum which allowed about two hundred pounds a man to the infantry,  and four hundred to the cavalry. It is true that the legionary troops  were then much reduced by the sword of the enemy, and by the tremendous  hardships of their last campaigns. In this, however, he did perhaps no  more than repay a debt. For it is an instance of military attachment,  beyond all that Wallenstein or any commander, the most beloved amongst  his troops, has ever experienced, that, on the breaking out of the Civil  War, not only did the centurions of every legion severally maintain a  horse soldier, but even the privates volunteered to serve without pay,  and (what might seem impossible) without their daily rations. This was  accomplished by subscriptions amongst themselves, the more opulent  undertaking for the maintenance of the needy. Their disinterested love  for Caesar appeared in another and more difficult illustration: it was a  traditionary anecdote in Rome that the majority of those amongst  Caesar's troops who had the misfortune to fall into the enemy's hands  refused to accept their lives under the condition of serving against  _him_.    In connexion with this subject of his extraordinary munificence, there  is one aspect of Caesar's life which has suffered much from the  misrepresentations of historians, and that is--the vast pecuniary  embarrassments under which he laboured, until the profits of war had  turned the scale even more prodigiously in his favour. At one time of  his life, when appointed to a foreign office, so numerous and so  clamorous were his creditors that he could not have left Rome on his  public duties had not Crassus come forward with assistance in money, or  by guarantees, to the amount of nearly two hundred thousand pounds. And  at another he was accustomed to amuse himself with computing how much  money it would require to make him worth exactly nothing (_i.e._ simply  to clear him of debts); this, by one account, amounted to upwards of two  millions sterling. Now, the error of historians has been to represent  these debts as the original ground of his ambition and his revolutionary  projects, as though the desperate condition of his private affairs had  suggested a civil war to his calculations as the best or only mode of  redressing it. Such a policy would have resembled the last desperate  resource of an unprincipled gambler, who, on seeing his final game at  chess, and the accumulated stakes depending upon it, all on the brink of  irretrievable sacrifice, dexterously upsets the chess-board, or  extinguishes the lights. But Julius, the one sole patriot of Rome, could  find no advantage to his plans in darkness or in confusion. Honestly  supported, he would have crushed the oligarchies of Rome by crushing in  its lairs that venal and hunger-bitten democracy which made oligarchy  and its machineries resistless. Caesar's debts, far from being  stimulants and exciting causes of his political ambition, stood in an  inverse relation to the ambition; they were its results, and represented  its natural costs, being contracted from first to last in the service of  his political intrigues, for raising and maintaining a powerful body of  partisans, both in Rome and elsewhere. Whosoever indeed will take the  trouble to investigate the progress of Caesar's ambition, from such  materials as even yet remain, may satisfy himself that the scheme of  revolutionizing the Republic, and placing himself at its head, was no  growth of accident or circumstances; above all, that it did not arise  upon any so petty and indirect a suggestion as that of his debts; but  that his debts were in their very first origin purely ministerial to his  wise, indispensable, and patriotic ambition; and that his revolutionary  plans were at all periods of his life a direct and foremost object, but  in no case bottomed upon casual impulses. In this there was not only  patriotism, but in fact the one sole mode of patriotism which could have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#2)"],[1,"comes and tells him, \"You have been condemned.\"  \"To banishment,\" he replies, \"or to death?\" \"To banishment.\" \"What about  my property?\" \"It is not taken from you.\" \"Let us go to Aricia then,\" he  said, \"and dine.\"           *       *       *       *       *    HOW A MAN ON EVERY OCCASION CAN MAINTAIN HIS PROPER CHARACTER.--To the  rational animal only is the irrational intolerable; but that which is  rational is tolerable. Blows are not naturally intolerable. How is that?  See how the Lacedaemonians endure whipping when they have learned that  whipping is consistent with reason. To hang yourself is not intolerable.  When then you have the opinion that it is rational, you go and hang  yourself. In short, if we observe, we shall find that the animal man is  pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational; and, on the  contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that which is rational.    Only consider at what price you sell your own will: if for no other  reason, at least for this, that you sell it not for a small sum. But  that which is great and superior perhaps belongs to Socrates and such as  are like him. Why then, if we are naturally such, are not a very great  number of us like him? Is it true then that all horses become swift,  that all dogs are skilled in tracking footprints? What then, since I am  naturally dull, shall I, for this reason, take no pains? I hope not.  Epictetus is not superior to Socrates; but if he is not inferior, this  is enough for me; for I shall never be a Milo, and yet I do not neglect  my body; nor shall I be a Croesus, and yet I do not neglect my property;  nor, in a word, do we neglect looking after anything because we despair  of reaching the highest degree.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW A MAN SHOULD PROCEED FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF GOD BEING THE FATHER OF  ALL MEN TO THE REST.--If a man should be able to assent to this doctrine  as he ought, that we are all sprung from God in an especial manner, and  that God is the father both of men and of gods, I suppose that he would  never have any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself. But if Caesar (the  emperor) should adopt you, no one could endure your arrogance; and if  you know that you are the son of Zeus, will you not be elated? Yet we do  not so; but since these two things are mingled in the generation of man,  body in common with the animals, and reason and intelligence in common  with the gods, many incline to this kinship, which is miserable and  mortal; and some few to that which is divine and happy. Since then it is  of necessity that every man uses everything according to the opinion  which he has about it, those, the few, who think that they are formed  for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of appearances have no mean or  ignoble thoughts about themselves; but with the many it is quite the  contrary. For they say, What am I? A poor, miserable man, with my  wretched bit of flesh. Wretched, indeed; but you possess something  better than your bit of flesh. Why then do you neglect that which is  better, and why do you attach yourself to this?    Through this kinship with the flesh, some of us inclining to it become  like wolves, faithless and treacherous and mischievous; some become like  lions, savage and bestial and untamed; but the greater part of us become  foxes, and other worse animals. For what else is a slanderer and  malignant man than a fox, or some other more wretched and meaner animal?  See then and take care that you do not become some one of these  miserable things.           *       *       *       *       *    OF PROGRESS OR IMPROVEMENT.--He who is making progress, having learned  from philosophers that desire means the desire of good things, and  aversion means aversion from bad things; having learned too that  happiness and tranquillity are not attainable by man otherwise than by  not failing to obtain what he desires, and not falling into that which  he would avoid; such a man takes from himself desire altogether and  confers it, but he employs his aversion only on things which are  dependent on his will. For if he attempts to avoid anything independent  of his will, he knows that sometimes he will fall in with something  which he wishes to avoid, and he will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises  good fortune and tranquillity and happiness, certainly also the progress  towards virtue is progress towards each of these things. For it is  always true that to whatever point the perfecting of anything leads us,  progress is an approach towards this point.    How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have said, and yet seek  progress in other things and make a display of it? What is the product  of virtue? Tranquillity. Who then makes improvement? Is it he who has  read many books of Chrysippus? But does virtue consist in having  understood Chrysippus? If this is so, progress is clearly nothing else  than knowing a great deal of Chrysippus. But now we admit that virtue  produces one thing, and we declare that approaching near to it is  another thing, namely, progress or improvement. Such a person, says one,  is already able to read Chrysippus by himself. Indeed, sir, you are  making great progress. What kind of progress? But why do you mock the  man? Why do you draw him away from the perception of his own  misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of virtue that he may  learn where to look for improvement? Seek it there, wretch, where your  work lies. And where is your work? In desire and in aversion, that you  may not be disappointed in your desire, and that you may not fall into  that which you would avoid; in your pursuit and avoiding, that you  commit no error; in assent and suspension of assent, that you be not  deceived. The first things, and the most necessary are those which I  have named. But if with trembling and lamentation you seek not to fall  into that which you avoid, tell me how you are improving.    Do you then show me your improvement in these things? If I were talking  to an athlete, I should say, Show me your shoulders; and then he might  say, Here are my Halteres. You and your Halteres look to that. I should  reply, I wish to see the effect of the Halteres. So, when you say: Take  the treatise on the active powers ([Greek: hormea]), and see how I have  studied it, I reply: Slave, I am not inquiring about this, but how you  exercise pursuit and avoidance, desire and aversion, how you design and  purpose and prepare yourself, whether conformably to nature or not. If  conformably, give me evidence of it, and I will say that you are making  progress; but if not conformably, be gone, and not only expound your  books, but write such books yourself; and what will you gain by it? Do  you not know that the whole book costs only five denarii? Does then the  expounder seem to be worth more than five denarii? Never then look for  the matter itself in one place, and progress towards it in another.  Where then is progress? If any of you, withdrawing himself from  externals, turns to his own will ([Greek: proairesis]) to exercise it  and to improve it by labor, so as to make it conformable to nature,  elevated, free, unrestrained, unimpeded, faithful, modest; and if he has  learned that he who desires or avoids the things which are not in his  power can neither be faithful nor free, but of necessity he must change  with them and be tossed about with them as in a tempest, and of  necessity must subject himself to others who have the power to procure  or prevent what lie desires or would avoid; finally, when he rises in  the morning, if he observes and keeps these rules, bathes as a man of  fidelity, eats as a modest man; in like manner, if in every matter that  occurs he works out his chief principles ([Greek: ta proaegoumena]) as  the runner does with reference to running, and the trainer of the voice  with reference to the voice--this is the man who truly makes progress,  and this is the man who has not travelled in vain. But if he has  strained his efforts to the practice of reading books, and labors only  at this, and has travelled for this, I tell him to return home  immediately, and not to neglect his affairs there; for this for which he  has travelled is nothing. But the other thing is something, to study how  a man can rid his life of lamentation and groaning, and saying, Woe to  me, and wretched that I am, and to rid it also of misfortune and  disappointment, and to learn what death is, and exile, and prison, and  poison, that he may be able to say when he is in fetters, Dear Crito, if  it is the will of the gods that it be so, let it be so; and not to say,  Wretched am I, an old man: have I kept my gray hairs for this? Who is it  that speaks thus? Do you think that I shall name some man of no repute  and of low condition? Does not Priam say this? Does not Oedipus say  this? Nay, all kings say it! For what else is tragedy than the  perturbations ([Greek: pathae]) of men who value externals exhibited in  this kind of poetry? But if a man must learn by fiction that no external  things which are independent of the will concern us, for my part I  should like this fiction, by the aid of which I should live happily and  undisturbed. But you must consider for yourselves what you wish.    What then does Chrysippus teach us? The reply is, to know that these  things are not false, from which happiness comes and tranquillity  arises. Take my books, and you will learn how true and conformable to  nature are the things which make me free from perturbations. O great  good fortune! O the great benefactor who points out the way! To  Triptolemus all men have erected temples and altars, because he gave us  food by cultivation; but to him who discovered truth and brought it to  light and communicated it to all, not the truth which shows us how to  live, but how to live well, who of you for this reason has built an  altar, or a temple, or has dedicated a statue, or who"]]]
