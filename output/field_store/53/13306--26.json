But  the folks put me in mind of a sect in our country they  call the Grahamites--they eat no meat and no exciting  food, and drink nothin stronger than water. They call  it Philosophy (and that is such a pretty word it has made  fools of more folks than them afore now,) but I call it  tarnation nonsense. I once travelled all through the  State of Maine with one of them are chaps. He was as  thin as a whippin post. His skin looked like a blown  bladder arter some of the air had leaked out, kinder  wrinkled and rumpled like, and his eye as dim as a lamp  that's livin on a short allowance of ile. He put me in  mind of a pair of kitchen tongs, all legs, shaft and  head, and no belly; a real gander gutted lookin critter,  as holler as a bamboo walkin cane, and twice as yaller.  He actilly looked as if he had been picked off a rack at  sea, and dragged through a gimlet hole. He was a lawyer.  Thinks I, the Lord a massy on your clients, you hungry  half starved lookin critter, you, you'll eat em up alive  as sure as the Lord made Moses. You are just the chap to  strain at a goat and swallow a camel, tank, shank and  flank, all at a gulp. Well, when we came to an inn, and  a beef steak was sot afore us for dinner, he'd say: oh  that is too good for me, its too exciting, all fat meat  is diseased meat, give me some bread and cheese. Well,  I'd say, I don't know what you call too good, but it  tante good enough for me, for I call it as tuf as laushong,  and that will bear chawing all day. When I liquidate for  my dinner, I like to get about the best that's goin, and  I ant a bit too well pleased if I don't. Exciting indeed!!  thinks I. Lord, I should like to see you excited, if it  was only for the fun of the thing. What a temptin lookin  critter you'd be among the galls, would'nt you? Why, you  look like a subject the doctor boys had dropped on the  road arter they had dug you up, and had cut stick and  run for it. Well, when tea came, be said the same thing,  it's too exciting, give me some water, do; that's follorin  the law of natur. Well, says I, if that's the case, you  ought to eat beef; why, says he, how do you make out that  are proposition? Why, says I, if drinkin water instead  of tea is natur, so is eatin grass accordin to natur;  now all flesh is grass, we are told, so you had better  eat that and call it vegetable; like a man I once seed  who fasted on fish on a Friday, and when he had none,  whipped a leg o' mutton into the oven, and took it out  fish, says he it's \"changed PLAICE,\" that's all, and  \"PLAICE\" aint a bad fish. The Catholics fast enough,  gracious knows, but then they fast on a great rousin big  splendid salmon at two dollars and forty cents a pound,  and lots of old Madeira to make it float light on the  stomach; there's some sense in mortifying the appetite  arter that fashion, but plagy little in your way. No,  says I, friend, you may talk about natur as you please,  I've studied natur all my life, and I vow if your natur  could speak out, it would tell you, it don't over half  like to be starved arter that plan. If you know'd as  much about the marks of the mouth as I do, you'd know  that you have carniverous as well as graniverous teeth,  and that natur meant by that, you should eat most any  thing that are door-keeper, your nose, would give a ticket  to, to pass into your mouth. Father rode a race at New  York course, when he was near hand to seventy, and that's  more nor you'll do, I guess, and he eats as hearty as a  turkey cock, and he never confined himself to water  neither, when he could get anything convened him better.  Says he, Sam, grandfather Slick used to say there was an  old proverb in Yorkshire \"a full belly makes a strong  back,\" and I guess if you try it, natur will tell you so  too. If ever you go to Connecticut, jist call into  father's, and he'll give you a real right down genuine  New England breakfast, and if that don't happify your  heart, then my name's not Sam Slick. It will make you  feel about among the stiffest, I tell you. It will blow  your jacket out like a pig at sea. You'll have to shake  a reef or two out of your waistbans and make good stowage,  I guess, to carry it all under hatches. There's nothin  like a good pastur to cover the ribs, and make the hide  shine, depend on't.    Now this Province is like that are Grahamite lawyer's  beef, its too good for the folks that's in it; they either  don't avail its value or wont use it, because work ant  arter their \"law of natur.\" As you say they are quiet  enough (there's worse folks than the Blue Noses, too, if  you come to that,) and so they had ought to be quiet for  they have nothin to fight about. As for politics, they  have nothin to desarve the name, but they talk enough  about it, and a plaguy sight of nonsense they do talk  too. Now with us the country is divided into two parties,  of the mammouth breed, the INS and the OUTS, the  ADMINISTRATION and the OPPOSITION. But where's the  administration here? Where's the war office, the Foreign  Office and the Home Office? where's the Secretary of the  Navy? where the State Bank? where's the Ambassadors and  Diplomatists (them are the boys to wind off a snarl of  ravellins as slick as if it were on a reel) and where's  that Ship of State, fitted up all the way from the  forecastle clean up to the starn post, chock full of good  snug berths, handsumly found and furnished, tier over  tier, one above another, as thick as it can hold? That's  a helm worth handlen, I tell you; I don't wonder that  folks mutiny below and fight on the decks above for it  --it makes a plaguy uproar the whole time, and keeps the  passengers for everlastinly in a state of alarm for fear  they'd do mischif by bustin the byler, a runnin aground,  or gettin foul of some other craft. This Province is  better as it is, quieter and happier far; they have berths  enough and big enough, they should be careful not to  increase 'em; and if they were to do it over agin, perhaps  they'd be as well with fewer. They have two parties here,  the Tory party and the Opposition party, and both on em  run to extremes. Them radicals, says one, are for levelin  all down to their own level, tho' not a peg lower; that's  their gage, jist down to their own notch and no further;  and they'd agitate the whole country to obtain that  object, for if a man can't grow to be as tall as his  neighbor, if he cuts a few inches off him why then they  are both of one heighth. They are a most dangerous,  disaffected people--they are eternally appealin to the  worst passions of the mob. Well, says tother, them  aristocrats, they'll ruinate the country, they spend the  whole revenu on themselves. What with Bankers, Councillors,  Judges, Bishops and Public Officers, and a whole tribe  of Lawyers as hungry as hawks, and jist about as marciful,  the country is devoured as if there was a flock of locusts  a feedin on it. There's nothin left for roads and bridges.  When a chap sets out to canvass, he's got to antagonise  one side or tother. If he hangs on to the powers that  be, then he's a Council man, he's for votin large salaries,  for doin as the great people at Halifax tell him. HE IS  A FOOL. If he is on tother side, a railin at Banks,  Judges, Lawyers and such cattle, and baulin for what he  knows he can't get, then HE IS A ROGUE. So that, if you  were to listen to the weak and noisy critters on both  sides, you'd believe the House of Assembly was ONE HALF  ROGUES AND TOTHER HALF FOOLS. All this arises from  ignorance. IF THEY KNEW MORE OF EACH OTHER, I GUESS THEY'D  LAY ASIDE ONE HALF THEIR FEARS AND ALL THEIR ABUSE. THE  UPPER CLASSES DON'T KNOW ONE HALF THE VIRTUE THAT'S IN  THE MIDDLIN AND LOWER CLASSES; AND THEY DON'T KNOW ONE  HALF THE INTEGRITY AND GOOD FEELIN THAT'S IN THE OTHERS,  AND BOTH ARE FOOLED AND GULLED BY THEIR OWN NOISY AND  DESIGNIN CHAMPIONS. Take any two men that are by the  ears, they opinionate all they hear of each other, impute  all sorts of onworthy motives, and misconstrue every act;  let them see more of each other, and they'll find out to  their surprise, that they have not only been lookin thro'  a magnifyin glass, that warnt very true, but a coloured  one also, that changed the complexion and distorted the  feature, and each one will think tother a very good kind  of chap; and like as not a plaguy pleasant one too.    If I was asked which side was farthest from the mark in  this Province, I vow I should be puzzled to say. As I  don't belong to the country, and don't care a snap of my  finger for either of 'em, I suppose I can judge better  than any man in it, but I snore I dont think there's much  difference. The popular side (I wont say patriotic, for  we find in our steam boats a man who has a plaguy sight  of property in his portmanter, is quite as anxious for  its safety, as him that's only one pair of yarn stockings  and a clean shirt, is for hisn) the popular side are not  so well informed as tother, and they have the misfortin  of havin their passions addressed more than their reason,  therefore they are often out of the way, or rather led  out of it and put astray by bad guides; well, tother side  have the prejudices of birth and education to dim their  vision, and are alarmed to undertake a thing from the  dread of ambush or open foes, that their guides are  etarnally descryin in the mist--AND BESIDE, POWER HAS  A NATERAL TENDENCY TO CORPULENCY. As for them guides,  I'd make short work of 'em if it was me. In the last war  with Britain, the Constitution frigate was close in once  on the shores of Ireland, a lookin arter some marchant  ships, and she took on board a pilot; well, he was a  deep, sly, twistical lookin chap, as you een amost ever  seed. He had a sort of dark down look about him, and a  lear out of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#19)"],[1,"logic and mathematics have (broadly speaking)  less self-evidence as they become more complicated. Judgements of  intrinsic ethical or aesthetic value are apt to have some self-evidence,  but not much.    Degrees of self-evidence are important in the theory of knowledge,  since, if propositions may (as seems likely) have some degree of  self-evidence without being true, it will not be necessary to abandon  all connexion between self-evidence and truth, but merely to say that,  where there is a conflict, the more self-evident proposition is to be  retained and the less self-evident rejected.    It seems, however, highly probable that two different notions are  combined in 'self-evidence' as above explained; that one of them,  which corresponds to the highest degree of self-evidence, is really an  infallible guarantee of truth, while the other, which corresponds to  all the other degrees, does not give an infallible guarantee, but only a  greater or less presumption. This, however, is only a suggestion, which  we cannot as yet develop further. After we have dealt with the nature  of truth, we shall return to the subject of self-evidence, in connexion  with the distinction between knowledge and error.        CHAPTER XII. TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD    Our knowledge of truths, unlike our knowledge of things, has an  opposite, namely _error_. So far as things are concerned, we may know  them or not know them, but there is no positive state of mind which can  be described as erroneous knowledge of things, so long, at any rate,  as we confine ourselves to knowledge by acquaintance. Whatever we are  acquainted with must be something; we may draw wrong inferences from  our acquaintance, but the acquaintance itself cannot be deceptive. Thus  there is no dualism as regards acquaintance. But as regards knowledge of  truths, there is a dualism. We may believe what is false as well as  what is true. We know that on very many subjects different people  hold different and incompatible opinions: hence some beliefs must be  erroneous. Since erroneous beliefs are often held just as strongly  as true beliefs, it becomes a difficult question how they are to be  distinguished from true beliefs. How are we to know, in a given case,  that our belief is not erroneous? This is a question of the very  greatest difficulty, to which no completely satisfactory answer is  possible. There is, however, a preliminary question which is rather less  difficult, and that is: What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood? It is  this preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter. In  this chapter we are not asking how we can know whether a belief is true  or false: we are asking what is meant by the question whether a belief  is true or false. It is to be hoped that a clear answer to this question  may help us to obtain an answer to the question what beliefs are  true, but for the present we ask only 'What is truth?' and 'What is  falsehood?' not 'What beliefs are true?' and 'What beliefs are false?'  It is very important to keep these different questions entirely  separate, since any confusion between them is sure to produce an answer  which is not really applicable to either.    There are three points to observe in the attempt to discover the nature  of truth, three requisites which any theory must fulfil.    (1) Our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite,  falsehood. A good many philosophers have failed adequately to satisfy  this condition: they have constructed theories according to which all  our thinking ought to have been true, and have then had the greatest  difficulty in finding a place for falsehood. In this respect our theory  of belief must differ from our theory of acquaintance, since in the case  of acquaintance it was not necessary to take account of any opposite.    (2) It seems fairly evident that if there were no beliefs there could  be no falsehood, and no truth either, in the sense in which truth is  correlative to falsehood. If we imagine a world of mere matter, there  would be no room for falsehood in such a world, and although it would  contain what may be called 'facts', it would not contain any truths, in  the sense in which truths are things of the same kind as falsehoods.  In fact, truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements:  hence a world of mere matter, since it would contain no beliefs or  statements, would also contain no truth or falsehood.    (3) But, as against what we have just said, it is to be observed that  the truth or falsehood of a belief always depends upon something which  lies outside the belief itself. If I believe that Charles I died on the  scaffold, I believe truly, not because of any intrinsic quality of my  belief, which could be discovered by merely examining the belief, but  because of an historical event which happened two and a half centuries  ago. If I believe that Charles I died in his bed, I believe falsely: no  degree of vividness in my belief, or of care in arriving at it, prevents  it from being false, again because of what happened long ago, and not  because of any intrinsic property of my belief. Hence, although truth  and falsehood are properties of beliefs, they are properties dependent  upon the relations of the beliefs to other things, not upon any internal  quality of the beliefs.    The third of the above requisites leads us to adopt the view--which has  on the whole been commonest among philosophers--that truth consists in  some form of correspondence between belief and fact. It is, however, by  no means an easy matter to discover a form of correspondence to which  there are no irrefutable objections. By this partly--and partly by the  feeling that, if truth consists in a correspondence of thought with  something outside thought, thought can never know when truth has been  attained--many philosophers have been led to try to find some definition  of truth which shall not consist in relation to something wholly outside  belief. The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the  theory that truth consists in _coherence_. It is said that the mark of  falsehood is failure to cohere in the body of our beliefs, and that it  is the essence of a truth to form part of the completely rounded system  which is The Truth.    There is, however, a great difficulty in this view, or rather two great  difficulties. The first is that there is no reason to suppose that  only _one_ coherent body of beliefs is possible. It may be that, with  sufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world  that would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different  from the real past. In more scientific matters, it is certain that there  are often two or more hypotheses which account for all the known facts  on some subject, and although, in such cases, men of science endeavour  to find facts which will rule out all the hypotheses except one, there  is no reason why they should always succeed.    In philosophy, again, it seems not uncommon for two rival hypotheses  to be both able to account for all the facts. Thus, for example, it is  possible that life is one long dream, and that the outer world has only  that degree of reality that the objects of dreams have; but although  such a view does not seem inconsistent with known facts, there is no  reason to prefer it to the common-sense view, according to which other  people and things do really exist. Thus coherence as the definition  of truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one  coherent system.    The other objection to this definition of truth is that it assumes the  meaning of 'coherence' known, whereas, in fact, 'coherence' presupposes  the truth of the laws of logic. Two propositions are coherent when both  may be true, and are incoherent when one at least must be false. Now in  order to know whether two propositions can both be true, we must  know such truths as the law of contradiction. For example, the two  propositions, 'this tree is a beech' and 'this tree is not a beech',  are not coherent, because of the law of contradiction. But if the law of  contradiction itself were subjected to the test of coherence, we should  find that, if we choose to suppose it false, nothing will any longer  be incoherent with anything else. Thus the laws of logic supply the  skeleton or framework within which the test of coherence applies, and  they themselves cannot be established by this test.    For the above two reasons, coherence cannot be accepted as giving the  _meaning_ of truth, though it is often a most important _test_ of truth  after a certain amount of truth has become known.    Hence we are driven back to _correspondence with fact_ as constituting  the nature of truth. It remains to define precisely what we mean by  'fact', and what is the nature of the correspondence which must subsist  between belief and fact, in order that belief may be true.    In accordance with our three requisites, we have to seek a theory of  truth which (1) allows truth to have an opposite, namely falsehood, (2)  makes truth a property of beliefs, but (3) makes it a property wholly  dependent upon the relation of the beliefs to outside things.    The necessity of allowing for falsehood makes it impossible to regard  belief as a relation of the mind to a single object, which could be said  to be what is believed. If belief were so regarded, we should find that,  like acquaintance, it would not admit of the opposition of truth and  falsehood, but would have to be always true. This may be made clear  by examples. Othello believes falsely that Desdemona loves Cassio. We  cannot say that this belief consists in a relation to a single object,  'Desdemona's love for Cassio', for if there were such an object, the  belief would be true. There is in fact no such object, and therefore  Othello cannot have any relation to such an object. Hence his belief  cannot possibly consist in a"]]]
