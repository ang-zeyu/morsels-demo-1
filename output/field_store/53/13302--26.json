After dark Forteune returned. He had fired at a huge  njína, but this time the cap had snapped. As the monster was  close, and had shown signs of wrath, we were expected to  congratulate Nimrod on his escape. Kindly observe the neat  gradations, the artistic sorites of Mpongwe lies.    At 7.30 A.M. on the next day the loads were placed upon the  crew's heads, and we made for the village, where the boat was  still drawn up. The \"monoxyle\" was full of green-brown rain  water, the oar-pins were represented by bits of stick, and all  the furniture was wanting. After a time, the owner, duly  summoned, stalked down from his hut, and began remarking that  there was still a \"palaver\" on the stocks. I replied by paying  him his money, and ordering the craft to be baled and launched.  It was a spectacle to see the bushmen lying upon their bellies,  kicking their heels in the air, and yep-yep-yeping uproariously  when Forteune, their master, begged of them to bear a hand. Dean  Presto might have borrowed from them a hint for his Yahoos. The  threat to empty the Alugu (rum) upon the sand was efficacious.  One by one they rose to work, and in the slowest possible way  were produced five oars, of which one was sprung, a ricketty  rudder, a huge mast, and a sail composed half of matting and half  of holes. At the last moment, the men found that they had no  \"chop;\" a franc produced two bundles of sweet manioc, good  travelling food, as it can be eaten raw, but about as nutritious  as Norwegian bark. At the last, last moment, Lángobúmo, who was  to accompany us, remembered that he had neither fine coat nor  umbrella,--indispensable for dignity, and highly necessary for  the delicacy of his complexion, which was that of an elderly  buffalo. A lad was started to fetch these articles; and he set  off at a hand-gallop, making me certain that behind the first  corner he would subside into a saunter, and lie down to rest on  reaching the huts.    Briefly, it was 9 A.M. before we doubled Point Nyonye, which had  now been so long in sight. With wind, tide, and current dead  against us, we hugged the shore where the water is deep. The surf  was breaking in heavy sheets upon a reef or shoal outside, and  giving ample occupation to a hovering flock of fish-eating birds.  Whilst returning over water smooth as glass I observed the  curious effect of the current. Suddenly a huge billow would rear  like a horse, assume the shape of a giant cobra's head, fall  forward in a mass of foam, and subside gently rippling into the  calm surface beyond; the shadowy hollow of the breakers made them  appear to impinge upon a black rock, but when they disappeared  the sea was placid and unbroken as before. This is, in fact, the  typical \"roller\" of the Gaboon coast--a happy hunting ground for  slavers and a dangerous place for cruizers to attempt. As the  sea-breeze came up strong, the swell would have swamped a  European boat; but our conveyance, shaped like a ship's gig, but  Dalmatian or Dutchman-like in the bows, topped the waves with the  buoyancy of a cork, and answered her helm as the Arab obeys the  bit. To compact grain she added small specific gravity, and,  though stout and thick, she advanced at a speed of which I could  hardly believe her capable.    Past Nyonye the coast forms another shallow bay, with about ten  miles of chord, in every way a copy of its northern neighbour--  the same scene of placid beauty, the sea rimmed with opalline  air, pink by contrast with the ultramarine blue; the limpid ether  overhead; the golden sands, and the emerald verdure--a Circe,  however, whose caress is the kiss of death. The curve is bounded  south by Point Dyánye, which appeared to retreat as we advanced.  At 2 P.M., when the marvellous clearness of the sky was troubled  by a tornado forming in the north-east, we turned towards a  little inlet, and, despite the heavy surf, we disembarked without  a ducking. A creek supplied us with pure cold water, a spreading  tree with a roof, and the soft clean shore with the most  luxurious of couches--at 3 P.M. I could hardly persuade myself  that an hour had flown.    As we approached Dyánye, at last, a village hoisted the usual big  flag on the normal tall pole, and with loud cries ordered us to  land. Lángobúmo, who was at the helm, began obeying, when I  relieved him of his charge. Seeing that our course was unaltered,  a large and well-manned canoe put off, and the rest of the  population walked down shore. I made signs for the stranger not  to approach, when the head man, Angílah, asked me in English what  he had done to offend me, and peremptorily insisted upon my  sleeping at his village. All these places are looking forward to  the blessed day when a trader, especially a white trader, shall  come to dwell amongst the \"sons of the soil,\" and shall fill  their pockets with \"trust\" money. On every baylet and roadstead  stands the Casa Grande, a large empty bungalow, a factory in  embryo awaiting the Avatar; but, instead of attracting their  \"merchant\" by collecting wax and honey, rubber and ivory, the  people will not work till he appears. Consequently, here, as in  Angola and in the lowlands of the Brazil, it is a slight to pass  by without a visit; and jealousy, a ruling passion amongst  Africans, suggests that the stranger is bound for another and  rival village. They wish, at any rate, to hear the news, to  gossip half the night, to drink the Utangáni's rum, and to claim  a cloth for escorting him, will he, nill he, to the next  settlement. But what could I do? To indulge native prejudice  would have stretched my cruize to a fortnight; and I had neither  time, supplies, nor stomach for the task. So Lángobúmo was  directed to declare that they had a \"wicked white man\" on board  who e'en would gang his ane gait, who had no goods but weapons,  and who wanted only to shoot a njína, and to visit Sánga-Tánga,  where his brother \"Mpolo\" had been. All this was said in a  sneaking, deprecating tone, and the crew, though compelled to ply  their oars, looked their regrets at the exceedingly rude and  unseemly conduct of their Utangáni. Angílah followed chattering  till he had learned all the novelties; at last he dropped aft,  growling much, and promising to receive me at Sánga-Tánga next  morning--not as a friend. On our return, however, he prospected  us from afar with the greatest indifference; we were empty-  handed. There has been change since the days when Lieutenant  Boteler, passing along this shore, was addressed by the canoe-  men, \"I say, you mate, you no big rogue? ship no big rogue?\"    At 5 P. M. we weathered Point Dyánye, garnished, like Nyonye,  with a threatening line of breakers; the boat-passage along shore  was about 400 yards wide. Darkness came on shortly after six  o'clock, and the sultry weather began to look ominous, with a  huge, angry, black nimbus discharging itself into the glassy  livid sea northwards. I suggested landing, but Lángobúmo was  positive that the storm had passed westwards, and he objected,  with some reason, that in the outer gloom the boat might be  dashed to pieces. As we had not even a stone for an anchor, the  plea proved, valid. We guided ourselves, by the fitful flashes of  forked and sheet lightning combined, towards a ghostly point,  whose deeper blackness silhouetted it against the shades.  Suddenly the boat's head was turned inland; a huge breaker,  foaming along our gunwales, drove us forwards like the downwards  motion of a \"swing-swong,\" and, before we knew where we were, an  ugly little bar had been crossed on the top of the curling scud.  We could see the forest on both sides, but there was not light  enough to trace the river line; I told Hotaloya to tumble out;  \"Plenty shark here, mas'r,\" was the only answer. We lost nearly  half an hour of most valuable time in pottering and groping  before all had landed.      At that moment the rain-clouds burst, and in five minutes after  the first spatter all were wet to the skin. Selim and I stood  close together, trying to light a match, when a sheet of white  fire seemed to be let down from the black sky, passing between us  with a simultaneous thundering crash and rattle, and a sulphurous  smell, as if a battery had been discharged. I saw my factotum  struck down whilst in the act of staggering and falling myself;  we lay still for a few moments, when a mutual inquiry showed that  both were alive, only a little shaken and stunned; the sensation  was simply the shock of an electrical machine and the discharge  of a Woolwich infant --greatly exaggerated.    We then gave up the partie; it was useless to contend against  Jupiter Tonans as well as Pluvialis. I opened my bedding, drank a  \"stiffener\" of raw cognac, wrapped myself well, and at once fell  asleep in the heavy rain, whilst the crew gathered under the  sail. The gentlemen who stay at home at ease may think damp  sheets dangerous, but Malvern had long ago taught me the perfect  safety of the wettest bivouac, provided that the body remains  warm. At Fernando Po, as at Zanzibar, a drunken sailor after a  night in the gutter will catch fever, and will probably die. But  he has exposed himself to the inevitable chill after midnight, he  is unacclimatized, and both places are exceptionally deadly--to  say nothing of the liquor. The experienced African traveller  awaking with a chilly skin, swallows a tumbler of cold water, and  rolls himself in a blanket till he perspires; there is only one  alternative.    Next day I arose at 4 A.M., somewhat cramped and stiff, but with  nothing that would not yield to half a handful of quinine, a cup  of coffee well \"laced,\" a pipe, and a roaring fire. Some country  people presently came up, and rated us for sleeping in the bush;  we retorted in kind, telling them that they should have been more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"ches. One of  these eagles was shot, after a gorge of the electric fish here  common; its coat was black and white, and the eyes yellow, with  dark pupils. Various lizards ran over the rocks; and we failed to  secure a water-snake, the only specimen seen on the whole trip.    About noon we struggled past Point Masalla, our \"Diamond Rock,\" a  reef ending in a triangular block, towering abruptly, and showing  by drift-wood a flood-line now twelve feet high. There are  several of these \"bench-marks;\" and the people declare that after  every few years an unusual freshet takes place. Here the current  impinges directly upon the rocks, making a strong eddy. \"They die  each time,\" said the interpreters, as the canoemen, with loud  shouts of \"Vai ou nao Vai? Vai sempre! Vai direito, ya mondele!\"  and \"Arister,\" a mariner's word, after failing to force the way,  tumbled overboard, with a hawser of lliana to act as tow-line.  \"Vai direito,\" according to Father Ciprani, also applies to a  \"wonderful bird, whose song consists in these plain words;\" and  \"Mondele\" is synonymous with the Utangáni of the Gaboon and the  East African Muzungu, a white man.    This bend was in former days the terminus of canoe travel up  stream. Grisly tales of mishap are told; and even now a musketry  salute is fired when boats pass without accident. Beyond Diamond  Rock is a well-wooded, stony cove, \"Salan Kunkati:\" Captain  Tuckey makes this the name of the Diamond Rock, and translates it  \"the strong feather.\" Quartz, before in lines and bands, now  appears in masses: the \"Coal Rock,\" which the chart places near  Insála (Bechope Point) on the northern bank, was probably  submerged. High cliffs towered above us, and fragments which must  have weighed twenty tons had slipped into the water; one of them  bore an adansonia, growing head downwards.    The next feature was Npunga Bay, low and leek-green, between the  blue-brown water, here some 700 yards broad, and the yellow sun-  burnt trough-sides. A little further on, at 2 P.M., the canoe-men  halted beyond a sandy point with two large \"Bondeiro\" trees, and  declared their part of the bargain to have been fulfilled.  \"Bonderro\" is a corruption of the Lusitanianized imbundeiro, the  calabash, or adansonia (digitata?): the other baobab is called  nkondo, probably the Aliconda and Elicandy of Battel and old  travellers, who describe the water-tanks hollowed in its huge  trunk, and the cloth made from the bark fibre. Thus the \"Condo  Sonio\" of the Chart should be \"Nkondo Sonho,\" the latter a proper  name. It is seldom that we find trees turned to all the uses of  which they are capable: the Congo people despise the nutritious  and slightly laxative flour of the \"monkey bread,\" and the young  leaves are not used as pickles; the bast is not valued for cloth  and ropes, nor are the boles cut into cisterns.    As will be seen, we ought to have insisted upon being paddled to  Kala cliff and bight, the Mayumba Bay of the Chart, where the bed  trends west-east, and shows the lowest rapids: the First Congo  Expedition went up even higher. At Nkongo ka Lunga, the point  marked by two calabashes, we inquired for the Nokki Congo, of  which we had heard at Chisalla, and which still exists upon the  chart,--districts and villages being often confounded. All  laughed, and declared that the \"port-town\" had long been sold  off, the same had been the case, even in Tuckey's day, with the  next settlement, \"Condo Sonio\" (the Baobab of Sonho), formerly  the great up-stream mart, where the slave-traders transacted  their business. All the population was now transferred inland  and, like our predecessors, we were promised a two hours' climb  over the rough, steep highland which lay in front. Then we  understood that \"Nokki\" was the name of a canton, not of a  settlement. Its south-eastern limits may have contained the \"City  of Norchie, the best situated of any place hitherto seen in  Ethiopia,\" where Father Merolla (p. 280) baptized 126 souls,--and  this is rendered probable by the crucifixes and coleworts which  were found by the First Congo Expedition.    Here, then, at 97.50 miles from the sea, ended our clan's cruize.  We could only disembark upon the clean sand, surrounded by cool  shade and blocks of gneiss, the favourite halting-place, as the  husks of ground-nuts show. Nchama Chamvu was at once sent off  with a present of gin and a verbal report of arrival to  Nessudikira Nchinu, (King), of Banza Nkaye, whilst we made ready  for a night's lodging à la belle étoile. The mesenger returned,  bringing a goat, and the good news that porters would be sent  early next morning. We slept well in the cool and dewless air,  with little trouble from mosquitoes. The voice of the cataract in  its \"sublime same-soundingness\" alone broke the silence, and the  scenery suggested to us, as to the first Britishers, that we  might be bivouacking among the \"blue misty hills of Morven.\"    September 8.--Shortly after sunrise appeared Gidi Mavunga, father  to the \"king,\" accompanied by five \"princes,\" in the usual black  coats, and some forty slaves, armed with pistols, blunderbusses,  and guns of French and Yankee build. Our visitors wore the  official berretta, European shirts, that contrasted with coral  necklaces and rings of zinc, brass, and copper, and handsome  waistcoats, fronted by the well-tanned spoil of some \"bush\"  animal, generally a wild cat, hanging like a Scotch sporran--this  is and has long been the distinctive sign of a \"gentleman.\"  According to John Barbot (Supplement, Churchill, v. 471), all men  in Loango were bound to wear a furskin over their clothes, viz.,  of an otter, a tame cat, or a cat-o'-mountain; a \"great wood or  wild cat, or an angali (civet-cat). Besides which, they had very  fine speckled spelts, called  enkeny,' which might be worn only  by the king and his peculiar favourites.\"    On the great man's mat was placed a large silver-handled dagger,  shaped somewhat like a fish-slicer; and the handsome hammocks of  bright-dyed cottons brought down for our use shamed our humble  ship's canvas. The visitors showed all that African câlinerie,  which, as fatal experience told me, would vanish for ever,  changing velvet paw to armed claws, at the first question of  cloth or rum. Meanwhile, we had only to visit their village \"upon  the head of Gidi Mavunga.\"    About 9 A.M. we attacked a true Via Dolorosa, the normal road of  the Lower Congo. The steep ascent of dry, clayey soil was strewed  with schist and resplendent silvery gneiss; quartz appeared in  every variety, crystallized and amorphous, transparent white,  opaque, dusky, and rusty. Tuckey's mica slate appears to be  mostly schist or gneiss: I saw only one piece of true slate which  had been brought from the upper bed. Merolla's talc is mostly  mica.    Followed an equally rough descent to a water set in fetid mud,  its iridescence declaring the presence of iron; oozing out of the  ground, it discharges during rains into the river: and,  throughout the dry season, it keeps its little valley green with  trees and shrubs. I observed what appeared to be the Esere or  Calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum), whose hairy pod is very  distasteful to the travelling skin: it was a \"Mucuna urens.\"    Another scramble upon a highly inclined hogsback, where weather-  worn brown-black granite, protruded bone-like from the clay  flesh, placed us at the outlying village of Kinbembu, with its  line of palms; here the aneroid showed 1,322 feet. After a short  rest, the hammock men resumed work over a rough plateau: the  rises were scattered with brush-wood, and the falls were choked  with the richest vegetation. Every hill discharged its own  rivulet bubbling over the rock, and the waters were mostly  chalybeate.    Presently appeared a kind of barracoon, a large square of thick  cane-work and thatch about eight feet high, the Fetish house of  the \"Jinkimba\" or circumcised boys, who received us with  unearthly yells. After a march of an hour and three  quarters,'covering five indirect and three direct miles in a  south-eastern rhumb, we reached Banza Nkaye, the royal village,  where the sympiesometer showed 1430 feet. Our bearers yelled  \"Abububu!\" showing that we had reached our destination, and the  villagers answered with a cry of \"Abía-a-a!\" The entrance was  triumphal: we left the river with a tail of fifty-six which had  swelled to 150 ragged followers.    After a short delay we proceeded to the \"palace,\" which was  distinguished from afar by a long projecting gable, forming a  cool verandah. Descending some three hundred feet, we passed a  familiar sight in Africa, where \"arboribus suus horror inest.\" A  tree-trunk bore three pegged skulls somewhat white with age;  eight years ago they were taken off certain wizards who had  bewitched their enemies. A labyrinthine entrance of transparent  cane-work served to prevent indecent haste, and presently we  found ourselves in presence of the Mfumo, who of course takes the  title of \"Le Rei.\" Nessudikira was a \"blanc-bec,\" aged twenty or  twenty-one, who till lately had been a trading lad at Boma--now  he must not look upon the sea. He appeared habited in the usual  guy style: a gaudy fancy helmet, a white shirt with limp Byronic  collar, a broad-cloth frock coat, a purple velvet gold-fringed  loin-wrap: a theatrical dagger whose handle and sheath bore cut-  glass emeralds and rubies, stuck in the waist-belt; brass anklets  depended over naked feet, and the usual beadle's cloak covered  the whole. Truly a change for the worse since Tuckey's day, when  a \"savage magnificence\" showed itself in the display of lions'  and leopards' skins; when no women were allowed to be present,  and when the boys could only clap hands: now the verandah is  surrounded by a squatting crowd and resounds with endless chatter  and scream.    Nessudikira, whose eyes by way of grandeur never wandered from  the floor, shook hands with us"]]]
