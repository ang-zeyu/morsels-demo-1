Several people spoke to him and  turned to look back after they had passed. He paused at the door of  White's saloon, took a sharp survey of the interior, then stepped  inside.    The saloon was large and cool, full of men and noise and smoke. The  noise ceased upon his entrance, and the silence ensuing presently broke  to the clink of Mexican silver dollars at a monte table. Sol White, who  was behind the bar, straightened up when he saw Duane; then, without  speaking, he bent over to rinse a glass. All eyes except those of the  Mexican gamblers were turned upon Duane; and these glances were keen,  speculative, questioning. These men knew Bain was looking for trouble;  they probably had heard his boasts. But what did Duane intend to do?  Several of the cowboys and ranchers present exchanged glances. Duane had  been weighed by unerring Texas instinct, by men who all packed guns. The  boy was the son of his father. Whereupon they greeted him and returned  to their drinks and cards. Sol White stood with his big red hands out  upon the bar; he was a tall, raw-boned Texan with a long mustache waxed  to sharp points.    \"Howdy, Buck,\" was his greeting to Duane. He spoke carelessly and  averted his dark gaze for an instant.    \"Howdy, Sol,\" replied Duane, slowly. \"Say, Sol, I hear there's a gent in  town looking for me bad.\"    \"Reckon there is, Buck,\" replied White. \"He came in heah aboot an  hour ago. Shore he was some riled an' a-roarin' for gore. Told me  confidential a certain party had given you a white silk scarf, an' he  was hell-bent on wearin' it home spotted red.\"    \"Anybody with him?\" queried Duane.    \"Burt an' Sam Outcalt an' a little cowpuncher I never seen before.  They-all was coaxin' trim to leave town. But he's looked on the flowin'  glass, Buck, an' he's heah for keeps.\"    \"Why doesn't Sheriff Oaks lock him up if he's that bad?\"    \"Oaks went away with the rangers. There's been another raid at Flesher's  ranch. The King Fisher gang, likely. An' so the town's shore wide open.\"    Duane stalked outdoors and faced down the street. He walked the whole  length of the long block, meeting many people--farmers, ranchers,  clerks, merchants, Mexicans, cowboys, and women. It was a singular fact  that when he turned to retrace his steps the street was almost empty. He  had not returned a hundred yards on his way when the street was wholly  deserted. A few heads protruded from doors and around corners. That main  street of Wellston saw some such situation every few days. If it was an  instinct for Texans to fight, it was also instinctive for them to sense  with remarkable quickness the signs of a coming gun-play. Rumor could  not fly so swiftly. In less than ten minutes everybody who had been on  the street or in the shops knew that Buck Duane had come forth to meet  his enemy.    Duane walked on. When he came to within fifty paces of a saloon he  swerved out into the middle of the street, stood there for a moment,  then went ahead and back to the sidewalk. He passed on in this way the  length of the block. Sol White was standing in the door of his saloon.    \"Buck, I'm a-tippin' you off,\" he said, quick and low-voiced. \"Cal  Bain's over at Everall's. If he's a-huntin' you bad, as he brags, he'll  show there.\"    Duane crossed the street and started down. Notwithstanding White's  statement Duane was wary and slow at every door. Nothing happened,  and he traversed almost the whole length of the block without seeing a  person. Everall's place was on the corner.    Duane knew himself to be cold, steady. He was conscious of a strange  fury that made him want to leap ahead. He seemed to long for this  encounter more than anything he had ever wanted. But, vivid as were his  sensations, he felt as if in a dream.    Before he reached Everall's he heard loud voices, one of which was  raised high. Then the short door swung outward as if impelled by a  vigorous hand. A bow-legged cowboy wearing wooley chaps burst out upon  the sidewalk. At sight of Duane he seemed to bound into the air, and he  uttered a savage roar.    Duane stopped in his tracks at the outer edge of the sidewalk, perhaps a  dozen rods from Everall's door.    If Bain was drunk he did not show it in his movement. He swaggered  forward, rapidly closing up the gap. Red, sweaty, disheveled, and  hatless, his face distorted and expressive of the most malignant intent,  he was a wild and sinister figure. He had already killed a man, and this  showed in his demeanor. His hands were extended before him, the right  hand a little lower than the left. At every step he bellowed his rancor  in speech mostly curses. Gradually he slowed his walk, then halted. A  good twenty-five paces separated the men.    \"Won't nothin' make you draw, you--!\" he shouted, fiercely.    \"I'm waitin' on you, Cal,\" replied Duane.    Bain's right hand stiffened--moved. Duane threw his gun as a boy throws  a ball underhand--a draw his father had taught him. He pulled twice,  his shots almost as one. Bain's big Colt boomed while it was pointed  downward and he was falling. His bullet scattered dust and gravel at  Duane's feet. He fell loosely, without contortion.    In a flash all was reality for Duane. He went forward and held his gun  ready for the slightest movement on the part of Bain. But Bain lay upon  his back, and all that moved were his breast and his eyes. How strangely  the red had left his face--and also the distortion! The devil that had  showed in Bain was gone. He was sober and conscious. He tried to  speak, but failed. His eyes expressed something pitifully human. They  changed--rolled--set blankly.    Duane drew a deep breath and sheathed his gun. He felt calm and cool,  glad the fray was over. One violent expression burst from him. \"The  fool!\"    When he looked up there were men around him.    \"Plumb center,\" said one.    Another, a cowboy who evidently had just left the gaming-table, leaned  down and pulled open Bain's shirt. He had the ace of spades in his hand.  He laid it on Bain's breast, and the black figure on the card covered  the two bullet-holes just over Bain's heart.    Duane wheeled and hurried away. He heard another man say:    \"Reckon Cal got what he deserved. Buck Duane's first gunplay. Like  father like son!\"        CHAPTER II    A thought kept repeating itself to Duane, and it was that he might have  spared himself concern through his imagining how awful it would be to  kill a man. He had no such feeling now. He had rid the community of a  drunken, bragging, quarrelsome cowboy.    When he came to the gate of his home and saw his uncle there with a  mettlesome horse, saddled, with canteen, rope, and bags all in place,  a subtle shock pervaded his spirit. It had slipped his mind--the  consequence of his act. But sight of the horse and the look of his uncle  recalled the fact that he must now become a fugitive. An unreasonable  anger took hold of him.    \"The d--d fool!\" he exclaimed, hotly. \"Meeting Bain wasn't much, Uncle  Jim. He dusted my boots, that's all. And for that I've got to go on the  dodge.\"    \"Son, you killed him--then?\" asked the uncle, huskily.    \"Yes. I stood over him--watched him die. I did as I would have been done  by.\"    \"I knew it. Long ago I saw it comin'. But now we can't stop to cry over  spilt blood. You've got to leave town an' this part of the country.\"    \"Mother!\" exclaimed Duane.    \"She's away from home. You can't wait. I'll break it to her--what she  always feared.\"    Suddenly Duane sat down and covered his face with his hands.    \"My God! Uncle, what have I done?\" His broad shoulders shook.    \"Listen, son, an' remember what I say,\" replied the elder man,  earnestly. \"Don't ever forget. You're not to blame. I'm glad to see  you take it this way, because maybe you'll never grow hard an' callous.  You're not to blame. This is Texas. You're your father's son. These are  wild times. The law as the rangers are laying it down now can't change  life all in a minute. Even your mother, who's a good, true woman, has  had her share in making you what you are this moment. For she was one of  the pioneers--the fightin' pioneers of this state. Those years of wild  times, before you was born, developed in her instinct to fight, to save  her life, her children, an' that instinct has cropped out in you. It  will be many years before it dies out of the boys born in Texas.\"    \"I'm a murderer,\" said Duane, shuddering.    \"No, son, you're not. An' you never will be. But you've got to be an  outlaw till time makes it safe for you to come home.\"    \"An outlaw?\"    \"I said it. If we had money an' influence we'd risk a trial. But we've  neither. An' I reckon the scaffold or jail is no place for Buckley  Duane. Strike for the wild country, an' wherever you go an' whatever  you do-be a man. Live honestly, if that's possible. If it isn't, be as  honest as you can. If you have to herd with outlaws try not to become  bad. There are outlaws who 're not all bad--many who have been driven to  the river by such a deal as this you had. When you get among these men  avoid brawls. Don't drink; don't gamble. I needn't tell you what to do  if it comes to gun-play, as likely it will. You can't come home. When  this thing is lived down, if that time ever comes, I'll get word into  the unsettled country. It'll reach you some day. That's all. Remember,  be a man. Goodby.\"    Duane, with blurred sight and contracting throat, gripped his uncle's  hand and bade him a wordless farewell. Then he leaped astride the black  and rode out of town.    As swiftly as was consistent with a care for his steed, Duane put a  distance of fifteen or eighteen miles behind him. With that he slowed  up, and the matter of riding did not require all his faculties. He  passed several ranches and was seen by men. This did not suit him, and  he took an old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#2)"],[1,"search of his pockets. \"When you spoke of Mrs. Bender that reminded  me of Laurel Grove, and Laurel Grove reminded me of Glenside, and that,  of course, made me think of the Guerins--Here 'tis!\" and the boy  triumphantly fished out a small letter from an inside pocket of his coat  and tossed it into Betty's lap.    \"It's from Norma Guerin!\" Betty's expressive voice betrayed her  delight \"Why, I haven't heard from her in perfect ages. I wonder what  she has to say.\"    \"Open it and see,\" advised the practical Bob. \"I meant to give you the  letter right away, and first the tart and then the blouse thing-a-bub  drove it out of my mind. I'll lead the horses and you can read as we  walk. Want me to take the plate back to Lee Chang?\"    He dashed back to the bunk house, returned the tin, and rejoined Betty,  who was slowly slitting the envelope of her letter with a hairpin. She  had tucked her candy box under her arm, and Bob took the bridles of the  two horses.    \"Mercy, what was that?\" Betty glanced up startled, as a wild yell sounded  over on their right.    There was a chorus of shouts, the same wild yell repeated, and then,  sudden and without warning, came a dense and heavy rain of blackest oil.    \"Oh, Bob, Bob!\" There was genuine anguish in Betty's wail of appeal. \"My  new blouse--look at it!\"    But Bob had no time to look at anything. Action was to be his course.    \"It's a premature blast!\" he shouted. \"Come on, we've got to get out!\"          CHAPTER II    NORMA'S LETTER      This was not Betty Gordon's first experience with an oil well set  off prematurely, and while she was naturally excited, she was not at  all afraid.    \"Get on Clover!\" shouted Bob. \"I do wish you'd ever wear a hat--\"    Betty laughed a little as she scrambled into her saddle. Bob, mounting  his own horse, wore no hat, but it was a pet grievance of his that Betty  persistently scorned headgear whether riding or walking.    \"Gallop!\" cried Bob. \"Shut your eyes if you want to--Clover will  follow Reuben.\"    The white horse set off, his awkward lunge carrying him over the ground  swiftly, and the little bay Clover cantered obediently after him. Oil  continued to rain down as they headed toward the north.    Betty closed her eyes, clutching her letter and candy box tightly in both  hands and letting the reins lie idle on her horse's neck. Clover,  galloping now, could be trusted to follow the leading horse.    \"Getting better now!\" Bob shouted back, turning in his saddle to see that  Betty was safe.    Betty's dark eyes opened and she shook back her hair, making a little  face at the taste of oil in her mouth. She slipped Norma Guerin's letter  into her pocket, glancing down at her blouse as she did so.    \"I'm a perfect sight!\" she called to Bob dolorously. \"I don't believe I  can ever get the oil spots out of this silk.\"    \"Sue the company!\" Bob cried, with a grin. \"Don't let Clover go to sleep  till we're nearer home, Betty.\"    The girl urged the little bay forward with a whispered word of  encouragement, and gradually, very gradually, they began to draw out of  the rain of oil.    Betty Gordon was not an Oklahoma girl, though she rode with the  effortless ease of a Westerner. She was an orphan, of New England stock,  and had come from the East to the oil fields to join her one living  relative, a beloved uncle whose interest in oil holdings made an  incessant traveler of him.    This Richard Gordon, \"Uncle Dick\" to Bob Henderson as well as to Betty,  had found himself unexpectedly made guardian of his little niece at a  time when it was impassible for him to establish a home for her. His time  and skill pledged to the oil company he represented, Mr. Gordon had  solved the problem of what to do with Betty by sending her to spend the  summer with an old childhood friend of his, a Mrs. Peabody who had  married a farmer, reputed well-to-do. Betty's experiences, pleasant and  otherwise, as a member of the Peabody household, have been told in the  first book of this series entitled \"Betty Gordon at Bramble Farm; or The  Mystery of a Nobody.\"    She made some true friends during the months she spent with the Peabodys,  and perhaps the closest, and certainly the most loyal, was Bob Henderson.  A year older than Betty, the fourteen year old Bob, whose life at Bramble  Farm had been harsh and unlovely and preceded by nothing brighter than a  drab existence at the county poor farm, became the champion of the  dark-eyed girl who had smiled at him and suggested that because they were  both orphans they had a common bond of friendship.    How Bob Henderson got track of his mother's people and what steps were  necessary before he could discover a definite clue, have been related in  the second volume of the series, entitled, \"Betty Gordon in Washington;  or Strange Adventures in a Great City.\"    In this book Bob and Betty came together again in the Capitol City, and  Betty acquired a second \"Uncle Dick\" in the person of Richard Littell,  the father of three lively daughters who innocently kidnapped Betty, only  to have the entire family become her firm friends. While in Washington  Bob and Betty each received good news that sent them trustfully to  Oklahoma, there to meet Uncle Dick Gordon, and later, Bob's own aunts.    The story of the \"Saunders' place\" and of the unscrupulous sharpers who  tried to cheat the old ladies who were the sisters of Bob's dead mother,  has been told in the third book about Betty Gordon. This book, \"Betty  Gordon in the Land of Oil; or The Farm that Was Worth a Fortune,\" relates  the varied experiences of Bob and Betty in the oil section of Oklahoma  and the long train of events that culminated in the sale of the Saunders  farm for ninety thousand dollars. Uncle Dick had been made guardian of  Bob, at his own and the aunts' request, so Bob was now a ward with Betty.    The possession of money, though it meant the difference between  poverty and debt and great comfort, had, to date, made very little  change in the mode of living of Miss Faith and Miss Charity Saunders,  or of their nephew.    This morning he had been delayed by some extra work on the farm, for the  oil company did not take possession till the first of the month, now a  week away, and Betty had ridden to the oil fields ahead of him. She  divided her time between the Saunders' place and the Watterby farm, where  she and Bob had stayed when they first came to Flame City.    \"Whew!\" gasped Bob as they finally emerged from the black curtain of oil.  \"Of all the messy stuff! Betty, you look as though an oil lamp had  exploded in your face.\"    \"Now I'll have to wash my hair again,\" mourned Betty. \"You'd better come  to Grandma Watterby's and get tidied up, Bob. It's nearer than your  aunts', taking this road; and they always have the stove tank full of  hot water.\"    Bob took this advice, and the sympathetic Watterby family came to the  oil-spotted pair's assistance with copious supplies of hot water, soap  and towels and liberal handfuls of borax, for the water was very hard.  Fortunately, Betty had a clean blouse and skirt at hand (most of her  wardrobe was in the guest room at the Saunders farm), and Bob borrowed a  clean shirt from Will Watterby, in which the boy, being much smaller than  the man, looked a little absurd.    \"I'm clean, anyway, and that makes me feel good, so why should I care how  I look?\" was Bob's defense when his appearance was commented on.    \"I'm so hungry,\" announced Betty, coming out of her room, once more trim  and neat, and sniffing the delicious odor of hot waffles. \"I wonder if I  could pin my hair up in a towel and dry it after lunch?\"    \"Of course you may,\" said Mrs. Will Watterby warmly. \"Did you fix a place  for Betty, Grandma?\"    \"What a silly question, Emma,\" reproved old Grandma Watterby  severely. \"Here, Betty, you sit next to me, and Bob can have Will's  place. He's gone over to Flame City with a bolt he wants the  blacksmith to tinker up.\"    Ki, the Indian who helped with the farm work, smiled at Betty but said  nothing more than the single \"Howdy,\" which was his stock form of  salutation. Mrs. Watterby's waffles were quite as good as they smelled,  and she apparently had mixed an inexhaustible quantity of batter. Every  one ate rapidly and in comparative silence, a habit to which Bob and  Betty were by now quite accustomed. When Mr. Gordon was present he  insisted on a little conversation, but his presence was lacking to-day.    \"You go right out in the sun and dry your hair, Betty,\" said Mrs.  Watterby, when the meal was over. \"No, I don't need any help with  the dishes. Grandma and me, we're going over to town in the car  this afternoon and I don't care whether I do the dishes till I come  back or not.\"    This, for Mrs. Watterby, was a great step forward. Before the purchase of  the automobile, bought with a legacy inherited by Grandma Watterby,  dishes and housework had been the sum total of Mrs. Will Watterby's  existence. Now that she could drive the car and get away from her kitchen  sink at will, she seemed another woman.    Betty voiced something of this to Bob as she unfastened the towel and let  her heavy dark hair fall over her shoulders. She was sitting on the back  porch where the afternoon sun shone unobstructed.    \"Yes, I guess automobiles are a good thing,\" admitted Bob absently. \"I  want Aunt Faith to get one. A runabout would be handy for them--one like  Doctor Guerin's. Remember, Betty?\"    \"My goodness, I haven't read Norma's letter!\" said Betty hastily. \"I left  it in my other blouse. Wait a minute, and I'll get it.\"    She dashed into the house and was back again in a moment, the letter Bob  had handed her just before the shower of oil, in her hand.    Bob, in his favorite attitude of lying on his back and staring at the  sky, was startled by an exclamation before Betty had finished the first  page of the closely written missive.    \"What's the matter?\" he demanded, sitting"]]]
