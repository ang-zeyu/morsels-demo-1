Susie had gotten married about the time we moved to Lamesa.  And  with her away from home, Mama was always short handed in the  kitchen, there being so many men and boys in the family and only  one little girl still at home, and she was too little to be of  much help.  And since Mama's kitchen work extended to the milk  shed, the henhouse, the vegetable garden, the wash house, the  clothes line, the ironing board, the yard and a few other odd  jobs about the place, she had to cut all the corners she could.    She never put our eating dishes up in the cabinet.  After she  washed them, she stacked them back on the dining table and  covered them with a cloth.  So, she didn't have to place the  dishes at mealtime.  We simply sat down and got our own plates  and tools.  And we took only the tools we needed.  There was no  need to have to wash a knife, a fork and a spoon when a spoon was  all we needed to use.    We grew up not knowing there were different forks to use for  different things.  We used the rule of instinct in choosing the  tool to use.  That is, \"If it's hard, use a knife, if it's soft,  use a fork, and if it's wet, use a spoon--except in the case of  molasses.  You sop molasses up with a piece of biscuit.\"    To save time and effort, Mama also left certain foods on the  dining table--the salt, sugar, pepper, syrup, honey, vinegar,  pepper sauce and other such things.  These were all covered with  the same cloth that covered our dishes.  We had no refrigerator.  Nothing would spoil at our house, we ate it before it had time to  spoil.    Mama needed help to wash the dishes after supper.  But boys don't  like to wash dishes.  So Mama was in trouble--but not for long.  She came up with an ultimatum:  \"You wash your own supper dishes  or eat out of your same plates for breakfast.\"    This was a boy's dream come true--no dish washing.  This was the  beginning of my sopping my plate clean.  We all did.  We could  lick our spoons as clean as any woman could wash them in a  dishpan.  And I seldom used any tool except a spoon.  Plates were  no problem either.  When it comes to shining plates, a good,  tough biscuit rind in the hands of a growing boy could just about  put a soap factory out of business.  And no matter what he sopped  out of his plate, it added flavor to his biscuit.    When we were through licking and sopping, each of us would place  our spoons on the table at our respective places, turn our plates  upside down over them and take off for things more interesting.  The last one to finish would help Mama spread a cloth over the  entire table and the job was completed.  Mama was out of the  kitchen in no time at all.  We had learned a long time ago not to  take anything on our plates that we couldn't eat.  Now that habit  was paying off.          CHAPTER 8    MOVED TO JONES COUNTY; PICKED COTTON IN OKLAHOMA    The dry weather still prevailed, and in spite of all our efforts  to earn extra money, we were getting deeper into trouble month by  month.  By the summer of 1918 we were about finished in our new  venture.  There was no grazing and no money for livestock feed.  Cows and horses grazed the short grass, taking in sand with each  bite.  Sand clogged their stomachs and they died with sand colic.  Many died but a few didn't.    Something simply had to give.  We just had to try something else.  After a long heart-breaking battle against the elements, we  rounded up the remaining cattle and drove them to the railroad  stockyards at Lamesa.  That was a slow exodus.  They were so poor  and weak some fell by the wayside and didn't finish the ten-mile  drive.  Most of them did make it.  I don't know where Papa sold  them nor what he got for them.  I know he couldn't have gotten  much.    After that, we sold the smaller farm and got rid of the Buick  car.  Susie and Dode moved onto the large farm, and the rest of  us moved to a farm near the community of Abbie, about nine miles  east of Hamlin.  We bought out a crop from someone in mid-summer.  It, too, proved to be a failure--we made three bales of cotton.    In that year and a half we had lost most of our money, our  cattle, quite a few of our horses and our best car.    After the crop failure at Abbie we had to try something else  again.  So we loaded the Reo car and went to Wichita Falls,  Texas, where the government was building an aviation camp to  train flyers for the war that was still going on.  Papa hired on  as a carpenter at six dollars a day.    Let me tell you about one night when some of us green-horn  country boys went to downtown Wichita Falls with Papa.  While he  was attending to some business, we boys got out of the car and  were looking at newspapers out in front of a drug store.  It must  have been a Saturday night because the newsracks were full of  Sunday funny papers.    We were keeping hands off and just seeing what we could see  without touching the papers when a stranger came by and told us,  \"You boys can have all the funny papers you want.  They only want  the newspapers.  Help yourselves to all you want.\"    Boy!  We were sure pleased to hear that.  I was beginning to  believe that city life was much more interesting than the country  life we were used to.  The funnies were just what we wanted.  And  we were getting more than our share when a friend, Harry Stacy,  came along and informed us that, \"If you boys don't want to get  put in jail, you better put those papers back in the racks and  get in that car in a hurry.\"  We did what he told us to do.    Harry was one of Frank's buddies.  He and Frank were carpentering  out at the aviation camp.  As far as I was concerned, I respected  Harry and I knew he had almost as much authority to spank us boys  as Frank had.  At least he was concerned about our well-being.  We didn't know that a stranger would lie like that to country  kids just to see them get into trouble.    Anyway, while Papa carpentered we lived in a tent--and it rained  and rained and rained, week after week.  Our tent didn't leak  from the top, but it might as well have.  Water soaked the ground  and came up in our tent as out of an artesian well.  Everything  was wet.  You could almost wring water out of the air in our  tent.    Mama had taken about all she thought she could.  She wanted to go  home to our farm at Abbie.  So Papa loaded us all up and drove  all one Saturday night.  We arrived at the farm about daybreak.  We hurried to get unloaded so Papa could drive back to Wichita  Falls Sunday and be there ready to work Monday morning.    But Mama didn't want to be on the Abbie farm without Papa there.  Of course he couldn't stay because he just had to make a living  for us.  He had to go back.  So we all loaded back into the car  and drove all day, back to the wet tent in a pasture about a  half-  mile from where Papa was carpentering.    When it didn't rain so much, we boys walked from our tent to  nearby farms and picked cotton.  We got to making so much money  in the cotton patch that our parents reasoned that we all,  working together in the cotton patch, could do much better than  we could with the family split up, some picking cotton and Papa  carpentering.    Knowing that the cotton crops were good in parts of Oklahoma, we  got ready and headed for Duncan.  Before we got there we saw that  the cotton was really good--fields were white beyond our  expectations.  Many people were in war work and there was a  shortage of laborers for the harvest.    But before we got to where we were going, we lost a suitcase off  one front fender and hadn't noticed it was gone.  The loss was  discovered by one of the older boys when we stopped for one of  the little ones to hide behind a bush.  Naturally, we couldn't  just drive on and leave the suitcase.  We had to go back and find  it.  And about five miles back down the road we found it hanging  on a fence post.    It seemed we were always stopping for bushes and culverts.  I was  twelve years old and there were three others in the car who were  younger.  And no two little kids ever have to \"go\" at the same  time.  So it was stop here for one and stop there for another  one.  Lucky for us, we had to stop for another one before the  suitcase got many miles behind.    There were no service stations with fancy restrooms in those  days-  -only greasy garages with gasoline pumps out in front on the  curbs and two-holers out back by the alley, all of which were  dirty and smelly.  Bushes along the road were much more sanitary.    However, I remember one garage that had indoor plumbing.  Years  ago, when I was just a little kid nine years old, Papa had gone  to a garage to get the carburetor adjusted on his car.  Joel and  I went with him.  And since it took the mechanic more than 15  minutes to do the work it was a good thing there was a place for  little boys to hide.    The nice man working on our car must have been a little boy  himself at one time or another, or maybe he had little boys of  his own.  At any rate, when he saw us whispering something in  Papa's ear, the man pointed to the stairway leading up to a  storeroom, in one corner of which was a little boy's room.    Yes, we found the room all right--and we used \"the thing\" in the  room.  But then we had a little trouble figuring out how to  operate the thing.  There was a wall-tank six-feet high on the  wall, with a lever extending outward from the top of it and a  long cord hanging down from the lever.  We couldn't figure  anything else to do, so we tried pulling on the cord.  That was  the secret--it worked.  Water came down from the wall-tank into  the bowl with a world of fury and gusto and noise.    Now we had another problem--should we have pulled the cord?  We  began to wish we had not.  The bowl was filling up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#19)"],[1,"of the opposite party came out on horseback  to meet us. The colonel sent two of our interpreters forward, and  the command was halted. Soon our guides returned and stated that the  supposed foe was a band of Indians which had had a battle with Mexicans  in the vicinity a few days before, and the Indians had returned to bury  their dead. They had taken us for enemies, but their fears were turned  into joy on discovering that we were American soldiers.    With all our bravery, there was a sigh of relief when we heard the news  that our supposed enemies were friends. It was now late in the day.  and both parties went into camp within a short distance of each other.  Friendly visits back and forth were made that evening. The Indians were  dressed in Spanish costume and were armed the same as the Mexicans;  as I remember them they displayed bravery, and some skill in Mexican  military tactics.    Next day we proceeded on our way, and passed down a dry wash, the  bottom of which was mostly lined with a whitish cobblestone, upon which  the feet of some comrade showed blood at every step for a hundred yards  or more. I cannot now recall the man's name. We continued our march  from that place, and afterwards learned that the Mexicans had intended  to make an effort to regain California, but the timely arrival of the  battalion prevented any attempt to execute the movement.    So far as I can remember, it was between January 23 and 27, 1847, that  we passed over a battlefield where General Kearney and his little  command had fought and beaten the Mexicans. There lay broken swords and  firearms, and dead horses and mules; and there also were the graves of  the slain, while all around the blood-stained soil was plainly within  our view, fixing the scene upon our memory.    Here came to our minds the words of President Brigham Young, in his  farewell address to the battalion, in which he said: \"You are now going  into an enemy's land at your country's call. If you will live your  religion, obey and respect your officers, and hold sacred the property  of the people among whom you travel, and never take anything but what  you pay for, I promise you in the name of Israel's God that not one of  you shall fall by the hand of an enemy. Though there will be battles  fought in your front and in your rear, on your right hand and on your  left, you will not have any fighting to do except with wild beasts.\"    Here I pause and ask: Who on earth dare to make, of himself, such a  promise, under the circumstances and in the name that this promise had  been made? And yet over three hundred men who heard it could stand  up after they had filled the time of their enlistment, and before  high heaven and all the world could bear testimony to the literal  fulfillment of those words spoken eight months before, in the camp in  Missouri Valley, two thousand miles distant. I ask the honest reader:  From whence came such foresight, if not from the Eternal God, the  Creator of the heavens and the earth, and all things therein? To Him we  ascribe all honor and glory, power and praise, for our success in that  great, wonderful and unparalleled march of twenty-five hundred miles  made by infantry. Who shall say that God had not made bare His arm in  support of that ever memorable Mormon Battalion? But as yet the whole  task of the battalion had not been completed.        CHAPTER XI.

ORDERS had been received changing our destination from Los Angeles to  San Diego, passing by way of the Mission San Luis del Rey. When we  reached the San Diego Mission we passed it by and camped between it and  the town. It was en route to this place that we came in sight of the  waters of the great Pacific Ocean, a view that was most pleasurable to  us, and which we hailed with shouts of joy, as we felt that our long  march of starvation was about over. We were now drawing five pounds of  fair beef, without salt or pepper.    Another day's march, and we had completed the journey over the nation's  highway across the continent. We were allowed one day at San Diego,  when we were ordered back to the San Luis del Rey Mission. There  was some disappointment, but the order to return was obeyed without  murmuring. It was thought we would meet the enemy, as it was said there  was a force of about eighteen hundred Californians, under General  Flores, lurking in the mountains northwest of San Luis del Rey Mission,  but we did not see them. At the Mission we were required to do fatigue  duty, as it was called, which included cleaning up the place, it having  been neglected a long time. At this place the following was issued by  Col. Cooke:                                     \"HEADQUARTERS, MISSION OF SAN DIEGO,                                                        \"January 30, 1847.    \"Lieutenant Colonel commanding congratulates the battalion on its safe  arrival on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and the conclusion of its  march of over two thousand miles. History may be searched in vain for  an equal march of infantry; nine-tenths of it through a wilderness,  where nothing but savages and wild beasts are found, or deserts where,  for want of water, there is no living creature. There, with almost  hopeless labor, we have dug deep wells, which the future traveler will  enjoy. Without a guide who had traversed them, we have ventured into  trackless prairies, where water was not found for several marches. With  crowbar and pickaxe in hand, we have worked our way over mountains,  which seemed to defy aught save the wild goat, and hewed a passage  through a chasm of living rock more narrow than our wagons. To bring  these first wagons to the Pacific, we have preserved the strength of  the mules by herding them over large tracts, which you have laboriously  guarded without loss.    \"The garrison of four presidios of Sonora, concentrated within the  walls of Tucson, gave us no pause; we drove them out with their  artillery; but our intercourse with the citizens was unmarked by a  single act of injustice. Thus marching, half naked and half fed, and  living upon wild animals, we have discovered and made a road of great  value to our country.    \"Arrived at the first settlement of California, after a single day's  rest, you cheerfully turned off from the route to this point of  promised repose, to enter upon a campaign, and meet, as we believed,  the approach of the enemy; and this, too, without even salt to season  your sole subsistence of fresh meat.    \"Lieutenants A.J. Smith and George Stoneman of the First Dragoons, have  shared and given valuable aid in all these labors.    \"Thus, volunteers, you have exhibited some high and essential qualities  of veterans. But much remains undone. Soon you will turn your strict  attention to the drill, to system and order, to forms also, which are  all necessary to the soldier.                     \"By order of Lieutenant-Colonel P. St. George Cooke.                                     [Signed.] \"P. C. Merrill, Adjutant.\"    It is stated by Sergeant Daniel Tyler, in his \"History of the Mormon  Battalion,\" that February 4th was the date of the reading of the order.  Its spirit and tone were an agreeable surprise to us, as the general  tenor of the colonel's course had been so different, apparently, that  we did not look for him to do the battalion justice. Yet if he had  been less stern and decisive, it would have been worse for us. We had  stern realities to deal with, consequently like means were necessary  to overcome the obstacles we had to contend with. It required push and  vim to enable the battalion to perform the heroic deeds demanded of it,  and a sympathy that would have caused the men to shrink back instead  of seeing that every one stood to his post of duty would have been a  fatal error. After all, Col. P. St. George Cooke was a good military  commander, maintaining excellent military discipline; and for one the  writer feels to say, Peaceful be his sleep.    It was about the 4th or 5th of February when we got back to the  mission, and the order given, with others, was made known. The other  orders included such directions as to trim the hair so that none came  below the tip of the ear, and shave the beard all but the mustache.    We were informed that we had no right to think in acting for  ourselves--that the government paid men to think for us, and it was our  duty to obey orders. We were allowed very little time in which to wash  our rags and hunt down the insects that had waged a continuous warfare  on us all the way from Albuquerque or the Rio Grande del Norte to the  coast; yet we turned on the creeping foe, and never relented till we  routed him, nor showed any quarter till the last one was gone. We also  had to repel an attack from the nimble flea in great numbers, in which  we realized that this impudent insect did not care where he hit.    While we were still living on beef alone, without pepper or salt, we  were ordered out on squad drill, which seemed to continue about eight  hours per day. The reason given for this was the supposed threatened  attack from eight hundred Californians in the mountains;"]]]
