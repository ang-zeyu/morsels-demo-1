Then Tip's fears were proven to be well founded; for with the first streaks  of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered rolling  plains dotted with queer villages, where the houses, instead of being dome-  shaped--as they all are in the Land of Oz--had slanting roofs that rose  to a peak        211  in the center. Odd looking animals were also moving about upon the open  plains, and the country was unfamiliar to both the Tin Woodman and the  Scarecrow, who had formerly visited Glinda the Good's domain and knew it  well.    \"We are lost!\" said the Scarecrow, dolefully. \"The Gump must have carried us  entirely out of the Land of Oz and over the sandy deserts and into the  terrible outside world that Dorothy told us about.\"    \"We must get back,\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman, earnestly. \"we must get back  as soon as possible!\"    \"Turn around!\" cried Tip to the Gump. \"turn as quickly as you can!\"    \"If I do I shall upset,\" answered the Gump. \"I'm not at all used to flying,  and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place, and then I can  turn around and take a fresh start.\"    Just then, however, there seemed to be no stopping-place that would answer  their purpose. They flew over a village so big that the Woggle-Bug declared  it was a city. and then they came to a range of high mountains with many  deep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly.    \"Now is our chance to stop,\" said the boy, finding        212  they were very close to the mountain tops. Then he turned to the Gump and  commanded: \"Stop at the first level place you see!\"    \"Very well,\" answered the Gump, and settled down upon a table of rock that  stood between two cliffs.    But not being experienced in such matters, the Gump did not judge his speed  correctly; and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it  by half the width of his body, breaking off both his right wings against the  sharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff.    Our friends held on to the sofas as long as they could, but when the Gump  caught on a proJecting rock the Thing stopped suddenly--bottom side up--and  all were immediately dumped out.    By good fortune they fell only a few feet; for underneath them was a monster  nest, built by a colony of Jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock; so none of  them--not even the Pumpkinhead--was injured by the fall. For Jack found  his precious head resting on the soft breast of the Scarecrow, which made an  excellent cushion; and Tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers, which saved  him from injury. The Woggle-Bug had bumped his round head against        213               Full page line-art drawing.                   ALL WERE IMMEDIATELY DUMPED OUT.        214  the Saw-Horse, but without causing him more than a moment's inconvenience.    The Tin Woodman was at first much alarmed; but finding he had escaped  without even a scratch upon his beautiful nickle-plate he at once regained  his accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades.    \"Our Journey had ended rather suddenly,\" said he; \"and we cannot justly  blame our friend the Gump for our accident, because he did the best he could  under the circumstances. But how we are ever to escape from this nest I must  leave to someone with better brains than I possess.\"    Here he gazed at the Scarecrow; who crawled to the edge of the nest and  looked over. Below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in depth.  Above them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the  wrecked body of the Gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the  sofas. There really seemed to be no means of escape, and as they realized  their helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave way to their  bewilderment.    \"This is a worse prison than the palace,\" sadly remarked the Woggle-Bug.    \"I wish we had stayed there,\" moaned Jack.        215  \"I'm afraid the mountain air isn't good for pumpkins.\"    \"It won't be when the Jackdaws come back,\" growled the Saw-Horse, which lay  waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again. \"Jackdaws are  especially fond of pumpkins.\"    \"Do you think the birds will come here?\" asked Jack, much distressed.    \"Of course they will,\" said Tip; \"for this is their nest. And there must be  hundreds of them,\" he continued, \"for see what a lot of things they have  brought here!\"    Indeed, the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small  articles for which the birds could have no use, but which the thieving  Jackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men. And as the nest  was safely hidden where no human being could reach it, this lost property  would never be recovered.    The Woggle-Bug, searching among the rubbish--for the Jackdaws stole  useless things as well as valuable ones--turned up with his foot a  beautiful diamond necklace. This was so greatly admired by the Tin Woodman  that the Woggle-Bug presented it to him with a graceful speech, after which  the Woodman hung it around his neck with much pride,        216               Full page line-art drawing.                   TURNED UP A BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND NECKLACE.        217  rejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the sun's rays.    But now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings, and as the sound  grew nearer to them Tip exclaimed:    \"The Jackdaws are coming! And if they find us here they will surely kill us  in their anger.\"    \"I was afraid of this!\" moaned the Pumpkinhead. \"My time has come!\"    \"And mine, also!\" said the Woggle-Bug; \"for Jackdaws are the greatest  enemies of my race.\"    The others were not at all afraid; but the Scarecrow at once decided to save  those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds. So he  commanded Tip to take off Jack's head and lie down with it in the bottom of  the nest, and when this was done he ordered the Woggle-Bug to lie beside  Tip. Nick Chopper, who knew from past experience Just what to do, then took  the Scarecrow to pieces (all except his head) and scattered the straw over  Tip and the Woggle-Bug, completely covering their bodies.    Hardly had this been accomplished when the flock of Jackdaws reached them.  Perceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with  screams of rage.        218               Full page line-art drawing.        219               Dr. Nikidik's Famous Wishing Pills      The Tin Woodman was usually a peaceful man, but when occasion required he  could fight as fiercely as a Roman gladiator. So, when the Jackdaws nearly  knocked him down in their rush of wings, and their sharp beaks and claws  threatened to damage his brilliant plating, the Woodman picked up his axe  and made it whirl swiftly around his head.    But although many were beaten off in this way, the birds were so numerous  and so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before. Some of  them pecked at the eyes of the Gump, which hung over the nest in a helpless  condition; but the Gump's eyes were of glass and could not be injured.  Others of the Jackdaws rushed at the Saw-Horse; but that animal, being still  upon his back, kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off  as many assailants as did the Woodman's axe.        220    Finding themselves thus opposed, the birds fell upon the Scarecrow's straw,  which lay at the center of the nest, covering Tip and the Woggle-Bug and  Jack's pumpkin head, and began tearing it away and flying off with it, only  to let it drop, straw by straw into the great gulf beneath.    The Scarecrow's head, noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his  interior, cried to the Tin Woodman to save him; and that good friend  responded with renewed energy. His axe fairly flashed among the Jackdaws,  and fortunately the Gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the  left side of its body. The flutter of these great wings filled the Jackdaws  with terror, and when the Gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of  rock on which it hung, and sank flopping into the nest, the alarm of the  birds knew no bounds and they fled screaming over the mountains.    When the last foe had disappeared, Tip crawled from under the sofas and  assisted the Woggle-Bug to follow him.    \"We are saved!\" shouted the boy, delightedly.    \"We are, indeed!\" responded the Educated Insect, fairly hugging the stiff  head of the Gump in his joy. \"and we owe it all to the flopping of the  Thing, and the good axe of the Woodman!\"        221    \"If I am saved, get me out of here!\" called Jack; whose head was still  beneath the sofas; and Tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it upon  its neck again. He also set the Saw-Horse upright, and said to it:    \"We owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made.\"    \"I really think we have escaped very nicely,\" remarked the Tin Woodman, in a  tone of pride.    \"Not so!\" exclaimed a hollow voice.    At this they all turned in surprise to look at the Scarecrow's head, which  lay at the back of the nest.    \"I am completely ruined!\" declared the Scarecrow, as he noted their  astonishment. \"For where is the straw that stuffs my body?\"    The awful question startled them all. They gazed around the nest with  horror, for not a vestige of straw remained. The        222  Jackdaws had stolen it to the last wisp and flung it all into the chasm that  yawned for hundreds of feet beneath the nest.    \"My poor, poor friend!\" said the Tin Woodman, taking up the Scarecrow's head  and caressing it tenderly; \"whoever could imagine you would come to this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#19)"],[1,"by the pox.

After several other    dispositions, the builder delivers over the galley to the    contractor as complete: but he, among other faults and    objections, observes the lion is not gilt, on which the builder    or one of his assistants, runs to the head, and dipping a    mop in the excrement, thrusts it into the face of the lion.
