Instead of accurate knowledge they had only the beautiful legends  preserved in ancient poems, such as the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. Within  our own day, however, remarkable excavations have disclosed the remains of  a widespread and flourishing civilization in times so distant that the  historic Greeks had lost all sight of it. As in the Orient, [4] the labors  of modern scholars are yearly adding to our knowledge of ancient life.    [Illustration: Map, AEGEAN CIVILIZATION]    [Illustration: EXCAVATIONS AT TROY The great northeast tower of the sixth  city. The stairs at the right belong to the eighth city.]    SCHLIEMANN'S EXCAVATIONS AT TROY    The man who did most to reveal the prehistoric civilization of Greece was  a wealthy German merchant named Heinrich Schliemann. An enthusiastic lover  of Homer, he believed that the stories of the Trojan War related in the  _Iliad_ were not idle fancies, but real facts. In 1870 A.D. he started to  test his beliefs by excavations at a hill called Hissarlik, on the  northwestern coast of Asia Minor. Here tradition had always fixed the site  of ancient Troy. Schliemann's discoveries and those of later explorers  proved that at Hissarlik at least nine successive cities had come into  existence, flourished, and passed away. Excavations completed in 1892 A.D.  have shown that the sixth city in order from the bottom was the one  described in the Homeric poems. It had powerful walls defended by towers,  well-fortified gates, and palaces of stone. The marks of fire throughout  the ruins indicate that the city must have been destroyed by a disastrous  conflagration.    SCHLIEMANN'S EXCAVATIONS AT MYCENAE AND TIRYNS    The remarkable disclosures at Troy encouraged Schliemann to excavate other  Homeric sites. At Mycenae, a prehistoric city of Argolis in Greece, he  laid bare six rock-hewn graves, containing the skeletons of nineteen  persons, men, women, and children. The faces of the dead had been covered  with thin masks of gold, and their bodies had been decked with gold  diadems, bracelets, and pendants. The other funeral offerings include gold  rings, silver vases, and a variety of bronze weapons. At Tiryns, once the  capital of Argolis, he uncovered the ruins of an extensive structure with  gateways, open courts, and closed apartments. Characteristic of this  edifice were the separate quarters occupied by men and women, the series  of storerooms for provisions, and such a modern convenience as a bathroom  with pipes and drains. In short, the palace at Tiryns gives us a clear and  detailed picture of the home of a Homeric prince.    [Illustration: LIONS' GATE, MYCENAE  The stone relief, of triangular shape, represents two lions (or lionesses)  facing each other on opposite sides of a pillar. The heads of the animals  have been lost.]    EVANS'S EXCAVATIONS AT GNOSSUS    But the fame of even Schliemann's discoveries has been somewhat dimmed by  the excavations made since 1900 A.D. on the site of Gnossus, the ancient  capital of the island of Crete. At Gnossus an Englishman, Sir Arthur  Evans, has found the remains of an enormous palace, with numerous courts,  passages, and rooms. Here is the royal council chamber with the throne on  which the king once sat. Here are the royal magazines, still filled with  huge earthenware jars for the storage of provisions. A great number of  brilliant pictures--hunting scenes, landscapes, portraits of men and  women--cover the palace walls. Buried in some of the chambers were  thousands of clay tablets with inscriptions which, if ever read, will add  new chapters to ancient history. [5]    [Illustration: THE VAPHIO GOLD CUPS (National Museum, Athens)  These beautiful objects were found in 1888 within a \"bee-hive\" tomb at  Vaphio in Laconia.

As early as  3000 B.C. the primitive inhabitants of the Aegean were giving up the use  of stone tools and weapons for those of metal. Bronze soon came into  general use, as is shown by the excavations. The five centuries between  1600 and 1100 B.C. appear to have been the time when the civilization of  the Aegean Age reached its highest development.    THE FINE ARTS    Remarkable progress took place during Aegean times in some of the fine  arts. We find imposing palaces, often splendidly adorned and arranged for  a life of comfort. Wall paintings, plaster reliefs, and fine carvings in  stone excite our admiration. Aegean artists made beautiful pottery of many  shapes and cleverly decorated it with plant and animal forms. They carved  ivory, engraved gems, and excelled in the working of metals. Some of their  productions in gold, silver, and bronze were scarcely surpassed by Greek  artists a thousand years later. [6]    COMMERCE    There was much intercourse throughout the Mediterranean during this  period. Products of Aegean art have been found as far west as Sicily,  Italy, and Spain, Aegean pottery has frequently been discovered in  Egyptian tombs. Some objects unearthed in Babylonia are apparently of  Aegean workmanship. In those ancient days Crete was mistress of the seas.  Cretan merchants preceded the Phoenicians as carriers between Asia and  Europe. [7] Trade and commerce thus opened up the Mediterranean world to  all the cultural influences of the Orient.    [Illustration: A CRETAN GIRL (Museum of Candia, Crete)  A fresco painting from the palace of Gnossus. The girl's face is so  astonishingly modern in treatment that one can scarcely believe that the  picture belongs to the sixteenth century B.C.]    DOWNFALL OF AEGEAN CIVILIZATION    Aegean civilization did not penetrate beyond the shores of Asia Minor, the  islands, and the coasts of Continental Greece. The interior regions of the  Greek peninsula remained the home of barbarous tribes, which had not yet  learned to build cities, to create beautiful objects of art, or to traffic  on the seas. By 1100 B.C. their destructive inroads brought the Aegean Age  to an end.      23. THE HOMERIC AGE (ABOUT 1100-750 B.C.)    COMING OF THE NORTHERN BARBARIANS    The barbarians who overthrew Aegean civilization seem to have entered  Greece from the north, perhaps from the region the Danube River. They  pushed gradually southward, sometimes exterminating or enslaving the  earlier inhabitants of the country, but more often settling peaceably  in their new homes. Conquerors and conquered slowly intermingled and so  produced the one Greek people which is found at the dawn of history. These  Greeks, as we shall call them henceforth, also occupied the islands of the  Aegean Sea and the coast of Asia Minor. The entire basin of the Aegean  thus became a Greek world.

On her head is an  elaborate crown.]    THE HOMERIC EPICS    The period between the end of the Aegean Age and the opening of historic  times in Greece is usually called the Homeric Age, because many features  of its civilization are reflected in two epic poems called the _Iliad_ and  the _Odyssey_. The former deals with the story of a Greek expedition  against Troy; the latter describes the wanderings of the hero Odysseus on  his return from Troy. The two epics were probably composed in Ionia, and  by the Greeks were attributed to a blind bard named Homer. Many modern  scholars, however, consider them the work of several generations of poets.  The references in the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ to industry, social life,  law, government, and religion give us some idea of the culture which the  historic Greeks received as their inheritance.    INDUSTRY    The Greeks as described in the Homeric epics were in a transitional stage  between the life of shepherds and that of farmers. Wealth consisted  chiefly of flocks and herds, though nearly every freeman owned a little  plot of land on which he cultivated grain and cared for his orchard and  vineyard. There were few skilled workmen, for almost everything was made  at home. A separate class of traders had not yet arisen. Commerce was  little followed. The Greeks depended on Phoenician sailors to bring to  their shores the commodities which they could not produce themselves. Iron  was known and used, for instance, in the manufacture of farm tools. During  Homeric times, however, that metal had not yet displaced copper and  bronze. [8]    SOCIAL LIFE    Social life was very simple. Princes tended flocks and built houses;  princesses carried water and washed clothes. Agamemnon, Odysseus, and  other heroes were not ashamed to be their own butchers and cooks. The  Homeric knights did not ride on horseback, but fought from chariots. They  sat at table instead of reclining at meals, as did the later Greeks.  Coined money was unknown. Trade was by barter, values being reckoned in  oxen or in lumps of gold and silver. Men bought their wives by making  gifts of cattle to the parents. The art of writing is mentioned only once  in the Homeric poems, and doubtless was little used.

And having  vanquished Samudrasena and king Chandrasena and Tamralipta, and also  the king of the Karvatas and the ruler of the Suhmas, as also the kings  that dwelt on the sea-shore, that bull among the Bharatas then  conquered all Mlechchha tribes. The mighty son of the wind-god having  thus conquered various countries, and exacting tributes from them all  advanced towards Lohity. And the son of Pandu then made all the  Mlechchha kings dwelling in the marshy regions on the sea-coast, pay  tributes and various kinds of wealth, and sandal wood and aloes, and  clothes and gems, and pearls and blankets and gold and silver and  valuable corals. The Mlechchha kings showered upon the illustrious son  of Kunti a thick downpour of wealth consisting of coins and gems  counted by hundreds of millions. Then returning to Indraprastha, Bhima  of terrible prowess offered the whole of that wealth unto king  Yudhisthira the just.\"      SECTION XXX    Vaisampayana said,--\"thus also Sahadeva, dismissed with affection by  king Yudhisthira the just, marched towards the southern direction  accompanied by a mighty host. Strong in strength, that mighty prince of  the Kuru race, vanquishing completely at the outset the Surasenas,  brought the king of Matsya under his sway. And the hero then, defeating  Dantavakra, the mighty king of the Adhirajas and making him pay  tribute, re-established him on his throne. The prince then brought  under his sway Sukumara and then king Sumitra, and he next vanquished  the other Matsyas and then the Patacharas. Endued with great  intelligence, the Kuru warrior then conquered soon enough the country  of the Nishadas and also the high hill called Gosringa, and that lord  of earth called Srenimat. And subjugating next the country called  Navarashtra, the hero marched against Kuntibhoja, who with great  willingness accepted the sway of the conquering hero. And marching  thence to the banks of the Charmanwati, the Kuru warrior met the son of  king Jamvaka, who had, on account of old hostilities, been defeated  before by Vasudeva. O Bharata, the son of Jamvaka gave battle to  Sahadeva. And Sahadeva defeating the prince marched towards the south.  The mighty warrior then vanquished the Sekas and others, and exacted  tributes from them and also various kinds of gems and wealth. Allying  himself with the vanquished tribes the prince then marched towards the  countries that lay on the banks of the Narmada. And defeating there in  battle the two heroic kings of Avanti, called Vinda and Anuvinda,  supported by a mighty host, the mighty son of the twin gods exacted  much wealth from them. After this the hero marched towards the town of  Bhojakata, and there, O king of unfading glory, a fierce encounter took  place between him and the king of that city for two whole days. But the  son of Madri, vanquishing the invincible Bhismaka, then defeated in  battle the king of Kosala and the ruler of the territories lying on the  banks of the Venwa, as also the Kantarakas and the kings of the eastern  Kosalas. The hero then defeating both the Natakeyas and the Heramvaks  in battle, and subjugating the country of Marudha, reduced Munjagrama  by sheer strength. And the son of Pandu then vanquished the mighty  monarchs of the Nachinas and the Arvukas and the various forest king of  that part of the country. Endued with great strength the hero then  reduced to subjection king Vatadhipa. And defeating in battle the  Pulindas, the hero then marched southward. And the younger brother of  Nakula then fought for one whole day with the king of Pandrya. The  long-armed hero having vanquished that monarch marched further to the  south. And then he beheld the celebrated caves of Kishkindhya and in  that region fought for seven days with the monkey-kings Mainda and  Dwivida. Those illustrious kings however, without being tired in the  encounter, were gratified with Sahadeva. And joyfully addressing the  Kuru prince, they said,--'O tiger among the sons of Pandu, go hence,  taking with the tribute from us all. Let the mission of the king  Yudhishthira the just possessed of great intelligence, be accomplished  without hindrance.' And taking jewels and gems from them all, the hero  marched towards the city of Mahishmati, and there that bull of men did  battle with king Nila. The battle that took place between king Nila and  the mighty Sahadeva the son of Pandu, that slayer of hostile heroes,  was fierce and terrible. And the encounter was an exceedingly bloody  one, and the life of the hero himself was exposed to great risk, for  the god Agni himself assisted king Nila in that fight. Then the cars,  heroes, elephants, and the soldiers in their coats of mail of  Sahadeva's army all appeared to be on fire. And beholding this the  prince of the Kuru race became exceedingly anxious. And, O Janamejaya,  at sight of this the hero could not resolve upon what he should do.\"    Janamejaya said,--\"O regenerate one, why was it that the god Agni  become hostile in battle unto Sahadeva, who was fighting simply for the  accomplishment of a sacrifice (and therefore, for the gratification of  Agni himself)?\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"It is said, O Janamejaya, that the god Agni while  residing in Mahishmati, earned the reputation of a lover. King Nila had  a daughter who was exceedingly beautiful. She used always to stay near  the sacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And  it so happened that king Nila's fire, even if fanned, would not blaze  up till agitated by the gentle breath of that girl's fair lips. And it  was said in King Nila's palace and in the house of all his subjects  that the god Agni desired that beautiful girl for his bride. And it so  happened that he was accepted by the girl herself. One day the deity  assuming the form of a Brahmana, was happily enjoying the society of  the fair one, when he was discovered by the king. And the virtuous king  thereupon ordered the Brahmana to be punished according to law. At this  the illustrious deity flamed up in wrath. And beholding this, the king  wondered much and bent his head low on the ground. And after some time  the king bowing low bestowed the daughter of his upon the god Agni,  disguised as a Brahmana. And the god Vibhabasu (Agni) accepting that  fair-browed daughter of king Nila, became gracious unto that monarch.  And Agni, the illustrious gratifier of all desires also asked the  monarch to beg a boon of him. And the king begged that his troops might  never be struck with panic while engaged in battle. And from that time,  O king, those monarchs who from ignorance of this, desire to subjugate  king Nila's city, are consumed by Hutasana (Agni). And from that time,  O perpetuator of the Kuru race, the girls of the city of Mahishmati  became rather unacceptable to others (as wives). And Agni by his boon  granted them sexual liberty, so that the women of that town always roam  about at will, each unbound to a particular husband. And, O bull of the  Bharata race, from that time the monarchs (of other countries) forsake  this city for fear of Agni. And the virtuous Sahadeva, beholding his  troops afflicted with fear and surrounded by flames of fire, himself  stood there immovable as a mountain. And purifying himself and touching  water, the hero (Sahadeva) then addressed Agni, the god that  sanctifieth everything, in these words,--    \"'I bow unto thee, O thou whose track is always marked with smoke.  These my exertions are all for thee. O thou sanctifier of all, thou art  the mouth of the gods and thou art Sacrifice personified. Thou art  called Pavaka because thou sanctifiest everything, and thou art  Havyavahana, because thou carriest the clarified butter that is poured  on thee. The Veda have sprung for ministering unto thee, and,  therefore, thou art called Jataveda. Chief of the gods as thou art,  thou art called Chitrabhanu, Anala, Vibhavasu, Hutasana, Jvalana,  Sikhi, Vaiswanara, Pingesa, Plavanga, Bhuritejah. Thou art he from whom  Kumara (Kartikeya) had his origin; thou art holy; thou art called  Rudragarva and Hiranyakrit. Let thee, O Agni, grant me energy, let Vayu  grant me life, let Earth grant me nourishment and strength, and let  Water grant me prosperity. O Agni, thou who art the first cause of the  waters, thou who art of great purity, thou for ministering unto whom  the Vedas have sprung, thou who art the foremost of the deities, thou  who art their mouth, O purify me by thy truth. Rishis and Brahmanas,  Deities and Asuras pour clarified butter every day, according to the  ordinance into thee during sacrifices. Let the rays of truth emanating  from thee, while thou exhibitest thyself in those sacrifices, purify  me. Smoke-bannered as thou art and possessed of flames, thou great  purifier from all sins born of Vayu and ever present as thou art in all  creatures, O purify me by the rays of thy truth. Having cleansed myself  thus cheerfully, O exalted one, do I pray unto thee. O Agni, grant me  now contentment and prosperity, and knowledge and gladness.'\"    Vaisampayana continued.--\"He that will pour clarified butter into Agni  reciting these mantras, will ever be blessed with prosperity, and  having his soul under complete control will also be cleansed from all  his sins.    \"Sahadeva, addressing Agni again, said,--'O carrier of the sacrificial  libations, it behoveth thee not to obstruct a sacrifice!' Having said  this, that tiger among men--the son of Madri--spreading some kusa grass  on earth sat down in expectation of the (approaching) fire and in front  of those terrified and anxious troops of his. And Agni, too, like the  ocean that never transgresseth its continents, did not pass over his  head. On the other hand approaching Sahadeva quietly and addressing  that prince of the Kuru race, Agni that god of men gave him every"]]]
