Have you learned now what  shuddering is?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"it's quite hopeless; if someone could  only tell me how to!\"    The second night he went up again to the old castle, sat down at the  fire, and began his old refrain: \"If I could only shudder!\" As midnight  approached, a noise and din broke out, at first gentle, but gradually  increasing; then all was quiet for a minute, and at length, with a loud  scream, half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell before him. \"Hi,  up there!\" shouted he; \"there's another half wanted down here, that's  not enough\"; then the din commenced once more, there was a shrieking  and a yelling, and then the other half fell down. \"Wait a bit,\" he said;  \"I'll stir up the fire for you.\" When he had done this and again looked  around, the two pieces had united, and a horrible-looking man sat on his  seat. \"Come,\" said the youth, \"I didn't bargain for that, the seat is  mine.\" The man tried to shove him away, but the youth wouldn't allow  it for a moment, and, pushing him off by force, sat down in his place  again. Then more men dropped down, one after the other, who fetching  nine skeleton legs and two skulls, put them up and played ninepins with  them. The youth thought he would like to play too, and said: \"Look here;  do you mind my joining the game?\" \"No, not if you have money.\" \"I've  money enough,\" he replied, \"but your balls aren't round enough.\" Then  he took the skulls, placed them on his lathe, and turned them till they  were round. \"Now they'll roll along better,\" said he, \"and houp-la! now  the fun begins.\" He played with them and lost some of his money, but  when twelve struck everything vanished before his eyes. He lay down and  slept peacefully. The next morning the King came, anxious for news. \"How  have you got on this time?\" he asked. \"I played ninepins,\" he answered,  \"and lost a few pence.\" \"Didn't you shudder then?\" \"No such luck,\" said  he; \"I made myself merry. Oh! if I only knew what it was to shudder!\"    On the third night he sat down again on his bench, and said, in the most  desponding way: \"If I could only shudder!\" When it got late, six big men  came in carrying a coffin. Then he cried: \"Ha! ha! that's most likely  my little cousin who only died a few days ago\"; and beckoning with his  finger he called out: \"Come, my small cousin, come.\" They placed the  coffin on the ground, and he approached it and took off the cover. In  it lay a dead man. He felt his face, and it was cold as ice. \"Wait,\" he  said \"I'll heat you up a bit,\" went to the fire, warmed his hand, and  laid it on the man's face, but the dead remained cold. Then he lifted  him out, sat down at the fire, laid him on his knee, and rubbed his arms  that the blood should circulate again. When that too had no effect it  occurred to him that if two people lay together in bed they warmed each  other; so he put him into the bed, covered him up, and lay down beside  him; after a time the corpse became warm and began to move. Then the  youth said: \"Now, my little cousin, what would have happened if I  hadn't warmed you?\" But the dead man rose up and cried out: \"Now I  will strangle you.\" \"What!\" said he, \"is that all the thanks I get? You  should be put straight back into your coffin,\" lifted him up, threw him  in, and closed the lid. Then the six men came and carried him out again.  \"I simply can't shudder,\" he said, \"and it's clear I sha'n't learn it in  a lifetime here.\"    Then a man entered, of more than ordinary size and of a very fearful  appearance; but he was old and had a white beard. \"Oh! you miserable  creature, now you will soon know what it is to shudder,\" he cried, \"for  you must die.\" \"Not so quickly,\" answered the youth. \"If I am to die,  you must catch me first.\" \"I shall soon lay hold of you,\" spoke the  monster. \"Gently, gently, don't boast too much, I'm as strong as you,  and stronger too.\" \"We'll soon see,\" said the old man; \"if you are  stronger than I then I'll let you off; come, let's have a try.\" Then he  led him through some dark passages to a forge, and grasping an axe he  drove one of the anvils with a blow into the earth. \"I can do better  than that,\" cried the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man  drew near him in order to watch closely, and his white beard hung right  down. The youth seized the axe, cleft the anvil open, and jammed in the  old man's beard. \"Now I have you,\" said the youth; \"this time it's your  turn to die.\" Then he seized an iron rod and belabored the old man till  he, whimpering, begged him to leave off, and he would give him great  riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him  back to the castle and showed him in a cellar three chests of gold. \"One  of these,\" said he, \"belongs to the poor, one to the King, and the  third is yours.\" At that moment twelve struck, and the spirit vanished,  leaving the youth alone in the dark. \"I'll surely be able to find a way  out,\" said he, and groping about he at length found his way back to the  room, and fell asleep at his fire. The next morning the King came, and  said: \"Well, now you've surely learned to shudder?\" \"No,\" he answered;  \"what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and an old bearded man came,  who showed me heaps of money down below there, but what shuddering is no  one has told me.\" Then the King spoke: \"You have freed the castle from  its curse, and you shall marry my daughter.\" \"That's all charming,\" he  said; \"but I still don't know what it is to shudder.\"    Then the gold was brought up, and the wedding was celebrated, but the  young King, though he loved his wife dearly, and though he was very  happy, still kept on saying: \"If I could only shudder! if I could only  shudder!\" At last he reduced her to despair. Then her maid said: \"I'll  help you; we'll soon make him shudder.\" So she went out to the stream  that flowed through the garden, and had a pail full of little gudgeons  brought to her. At night, when the young King was asleep, his wife had  to pull the clothes off him, and pour the pail full of little gudgeons  over him, so that the little fish swam all about him. Then he awoke and  cried out: \"Oh! how I shudder, how I shudder, dear wife! Yes, now I know  what shuddering is.\"(1)      (1) Grimm.          RUMPELSTILTZKIN      There was once upon a time a poor miller who had a very beautiful  daughter. Now it happened one day that he had an audience with the King,  and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that  he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. \"Now that's a talent  worth having,\" said the King to the miller; \"if your daughter is as  clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and I'll put her to  the test.\" When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full  of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: \"Now set to  work and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you haven't  spun the straw into gold you shall die.\" Then he closed the door behind  him and left her alone inside.    So the poor miller's daughter sat down, and didn't know what in the  world she was to do. She hadn't the least idea of how to spin straw into  gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry.  Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said:  \"Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?\" \"Oh!\"  answered the girl, \"I have to spin straw into gold, and haven't a notion  how it's done.\" \"What will you give me if I spin it for you?\" asked  the manikin. \"My necklace,\" replied the girl. The little man took the  necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel  went round three times, and the bobbin was full. Then he put on another,  and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the second  too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw  was spun away, and all the bobbins were full of gold. As soon as the sun  rose the King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and  delighted, but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious  metal. He had the miller's daughter put into another room full of straw,  much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin  it all into gold before the following morning. The girl didn't know what  to do, and began to cry; then the door opened as before, and the tiny  little man appeared and said: \"What'll you give me if I spin the straw  into gold for you?\" \"The ring from my finger,\" answered the girl. The  manikin took the ring, and whir! round went the spinning-wheel again,  and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold.  The King was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold  was still not satisfied, and he had the miller's daughter brought into a  yet bigger room full of straw, and said: \"You must spin all this away  in the night; but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife.\"  \"She's only a miller's daughter, it's true,\" he thought; \"but I couldn't  find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.\" When the  girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said:  \"What'll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?\" \"I've  nothing more to give,\" answered the girl. \"Then promise me when you  are Queen to give me your first child.\" \"Who knows what may not happen  before that?\" thought the miller's daughter; and besides, she saw no  other way out of it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and  he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold. When the  King came in the morning, and found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#19)"],[1,"re) to the spirits in prison, to fulfill an important      part of his mission, without which he could not have perfected his      work or entered into his rest. After his resurrection he appeared      as an angel to his disciples.        * * *        Translated bodies cannot enter into rest until they have undergone      a change equivalent to death.        * * *        Translated bodies are designed for future missions.        * * *        The angel which appeared to John on the Isle of Patmos was a      translated or resurrected body.        * * *        Jesus Christ went in body after his resurrection to minister to      translated and resurrected bodies.        * * *        It is no more incredible that God should _save_ the dead than that      he should raise the dead.        * * *        There is never a time when the spirit is too old to approach God.        * * *        All are within the reach of pardoning mercy, who have not committed      the unpardonable sin, which hath no forgiveness, neither in      this world, nor in the world to come. There is a way to release      the spirit of the dead; that is by the power and authority of      the Priesthood--by binding and loosing on earth. This doctrine      appears glorious, inasmuch as it exhibits the greatness of divine      compassion and benevolence in the extent of the plan of human      salvation.        This glorious truth is well calculated to enlarge the      understanding, and to sustain the soul under troubles,      difficulties, and distresses. For illustration, suppose the case      of two men, brothers, equally intelligent, learned, virtuous and      lovely, walking in uprightness and in all good conscience, so far      as they had been able to discern duty from the muddy stream of      tradition, or from the blotted page of the book of nature. One dies      and is buried, having never heard the Gospel of reconciliation; to      the other the message of salvation is sent, he hears and embraces      it, and is made the heir of eternal life. Shall the one become a      partaker of glory, and the other consigned to hopeless perdition?      Is there no chance for his escape? Sectarianism answers, none!      none! none!!! Such an idea is worse than atheism. The truth shall      break down and dash in pieces all such bigoted Pharisaism; the      sects shall be sifted, the honest in heart brought out, and their      priests left in the midst of their corruption.        * * *        This doctrine presents in a clear light the wisdom and mercy of      God in preparing an ordinance for the salvation of the dead,      being baptized by proxy, their names recorded in heaven, and they      judged according to the deeds done in the body. This doctrine was      the burden of the Scriptures. Those Saints who neglect it, in      behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their      own salvation. The dispensation of the fullness of times will      bring to light the things that have been revealed in all former      dispensations; also other things that have not been before revealed.        * * *    Another interesting feature of the conference was the report made by  the Prophet of The Church property in his charge as trustee-in-trust  for The Church. He also took occasion to report the amount of his own  earthly possessions, of which the following is a copy:        Old Charley, a horse given to him several years before in Kirtland;      two pet deers; two old turkeys and four young ones; an old cow      given to him by a brother in Missouri; old Major, a dog; his wife,      children, and a little household furniture!    Surely his earthly possessions did not far exceed those of Him who had  not where to lay His head!    Footnotes    1.

The font was constructed of pine timber, and put together of staves  tongued and grooved, oval shaped, sixteen feet long east and west, and  twelve feet wide, seven feet high from the foundation, the basin four  feet deep; the moulding of the cap or base was formed of beautiful  carved wood in antique style, and the sides were finished with panel  work. There were steps leading up and down into the basin in the north  and south sides, guarded by side railings. The font stood upon twelve  oxen, four on each side and two at each end, their heads, shoulders  and forelegs projecting out from under the font. They were carved out  of pine plank, glued together, and copied after the most beautiful  five-year-old steer that could be found in the country. * * * The  oxen and ornamental mouldings of the font were carved by Elder Elijah  Fordham, from New York. * * * The font was inclosed by a temporary  frame building sided up with split oak clap-boards, with a roof of  the same material, but was so low that the timbers of the first story  of the temple were laid above it. The water was supplied from a well  thirty feet deep in the east end of the basement. This font was built  for the baptism for the dead until the temple could be completed, when  a more durable one was to take its place.--_Millennial Star_, Volume  XVIII, 744.        CHAPTER XX.    INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW MARRIAGE SYSTEM.    ANOTHER matter of very great importance, and one which has exercised  a great influence upon the course of events in the history of The  Church--and especially upon the events of this Nauvoo period--belongs  to the spring and summer of 1841; and many things of our history will  be all the plainer if the matter referred to be considered now. I  refer to the introduction, in practice, of the marriage system which  afterwards obtained in The Church. The chief and greatest feature  of this marriage system--celestial marriage it is called by The  Church, because it is the marriage system that obtains in celestial  worlds--is the eternity of the marriage covenant. \"Until death us do  part\" is usually the mutual covenant of man and woman in the orthodox  \"Christian\" marriage ceremony. [1] That is, the marriage covenant  is understood among \"Christians\" generally as being a matter that  pertains to time only, the contract obligations ending with death. But  this celestial marriage system of The Church regards the incident of  death not at all, but makes the covenant of marriage for time and for  all eternity; a covenant which is sealed and ratified by that power  of the Priesthood in the administrator which binds on earth and it  is bound in heaven. [2] That is, the covenant of marriage holds good  through time and will be in effect and of binding force in and after  the resurrection. In other words this marriage system regards man as  enduring eternally, and formulates his marriage covenants in harmony  with that view of him. Of course this contemplates the continuation of  the marriage state in eternity. Not only the spiritual and intellectual  companionship, but all the relations of the wedded state, with the joys  of parentage--the power of endless lives being among the means of man's  exaltation and glory. That this is a view of marriage quite distinct  from the usual \"Christian\" view, goes without saying. It throws a new  light upon man's future existence. It destroys the vagueness which  through nearly all ages like a mystic pall has hidden the glory and  exaltation destined for man in the future eternities of God. It should  be said, in this connection, that the revelations of God to Joseph  Smith even before this marriage system was made known, held out to man  the hope of a tangible future existence in a resurrected, immortal  body of flesh and bones quickened by the spirit, and clothed with the  glory of immortal youth. The future life was to be a reality, not a  land of shadows; his heavenly home was to be upon the earth, after  it had become sanctified and made a celestial sphere. His relations  with his kindred and friends were to be of a nature to satisfy the  longings of the human heart for society, for fellowship; and needed  only the revelation of this marriage system to complete the circle of  his promised future felicity. For grant to man in his resurrected state  a real, tangible existence; an immortal youth that knows no pain or  sickness or disease; the power to \"hive\" knowledge and wisdom as the  centuries, the millenniums and eternities roll by; grant him the power  to build and inhabit; to love and be loved; and add to that the power  of endless lives--the power and privilege to perpetuate his race under  an eternal marriage covenant--grant this, and the future happiness,  exaltation and glory of man stands revealed as being absolutely without  limitations, and far greater and beyond in majesty anything within our  power to conceive in our present state of semi-dullness.    I say that the primary principle of the marriage system of The Church  is the eternity of the marriage covenant; but owing to the fact  that the system also includes the doctrine of a plurality of wives,  the importance and grandeur of the doctrine of the eternity of the  marriage covenant to a very great extent has been lost sight of in the  discussion of and the popular clamor concerning the plurality feature  of this new marriage system. The revelation making known this marriage  doctrine came about in this way: First it"]]]
