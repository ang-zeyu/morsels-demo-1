In this mock court of inquiry the defendants were      prevented from giving any testimony on their part, by an armed      force at the court house; they were advised by their lawyers not to      bring any [witnesses], as they would be in danger of their lives,      or be driven out of the county; so there was no testimony examined      only against them.        In this inquiry a great many questions were asked relative to      religious opinions. [3] The conclusion of the court of inquiry was      to send the prisoners to jail upon a charge of treason.        They do not deem it necessary to detail their sufferings while in      prison, the horrors of a prison for four long months, in darkness,      in want, alone, and during the cold of winter, can better be      conceived than expressed. In the following April the prisoners were      sent to the county of Daviess for trial: they were then indicted      for treason, and a change of venue was taken to Boone county. The      prisoners were sent to the county of Boone, and while on their way      made their escape, and fled to the state of Illinois.        That they were suffered to escape admits of no doubt. The truth      is, the state of Missouri had become ashamed of their proceedings      against the \"Mormons,\" and as the best means of getting out of the      scrape, gave the prisoners an opportunity to escape. In proof of      this, the prisoners have ever since been living publicly in the      state of Illinois, {36} and the executive of Missouri has made no      demand upon the executive of Illinois. Can it be supposed that      the people of Missouri would thus tamely submit to the commission      of treason by a portion of their citizens, and make no effort      to punish the guilty, when they were thus publicly living in an      adjoining state? Is not this passiveness evidence? They knew the      \"Mormons\" were innocent, and the citizens of Missouri wrong?        But to return to the operations of General Lucas before Far West:      We need only say that the exterminating order of Governor Boggs was      carried into full effect. After the above-named individuals were      taken prisoners, all the \"Mormons\" in Far West, about five hundred      in number, surrendered up their arms to the militia without any      resistance. The \"Mormons\" now fled in every direction--women and      children, through the dead of winter, marked their footsteps with      blood, as they fled from the state of Missouri.        The orders of the governor were, that they should be driven from      the state or destroyed. About fifteen thousand souls, between      the sacking of Far West and spring, abandoned their homes, their      property, their all, hurried by the terrors of their armed      pursuers, in want of every necessary of life, with bleeding hearts      sought refuge in the state of Illinois, where they now reside.        We cannot trespass upon your time by the relation of cases of      individual suffering; they would fill a volume. We forbear for our      regard to humanity, to detail the particulars of the conduct of      the Missouri militia. We could relate instances of house-burnings,      destruction of property, robbings, rapes, and murder, that would      shame humanity. One instance as a sample of many scenes which      they enacted: Two hundred of the militia came suddenly upon some      \"Mormon\" families emigrating to the state, and then encamped at      Haun's mill in Caldwell county. The \"Mormon\" men and children took      refuge in an old log house which had been used as a blacksmith's      shop. On seeing the militia approach, the \"Mormons\" cried for      quarters, but in vain; they were instantly fired upon; eighteen      fell dead; and their murderers, putting the muzzle of their guns      between the logs, fired indiscriminately upon children, upon the      dead and dying. One little boy, whose father (Warren Smith) had      just been shot dead, cried piteously to the militia to spare his      life. The reply was, \"Kill him, kill him (with an oath), he is a      son of a damned Mormon.\" At this they shot his head all open, and      left him dead by the side of his father. About the same time an old      man by the name of McBride, a soldier of the Revolution, came up to      them and begged his life; but they hewed him to pieces with an old      corn cutter. They then loaded themselves with plunder and departed.        Your petitioners have thus given a brief outline of the history      of the {37} \"Mormon\" persecutions in Missouri--all which they can      prove to be true, if an opportunity be given them. It will be seen      from this their brief statement, that neither the \"Mormons\" as a      body, nor individuals of that body, have been guilty of any offense      against the laws of Missouri, or of the United States; but their      only offense has been their religious opinion.        The above statement will also show, that the \"Mormons\" on all      occasions submitted to the law of the land, and yielded to its      authority in every extremity, and at every hazard, at the risk of      life and property. The above statement will illustrate another      truth; that wherever the \"Mormons\" made any resistance to the mob,      it was in self defense; and for these acts of self defense they      always had the authority and sanction of the officers of the law      for so doing. Yet they, to the number of about fifteen thousand      souls, have been driven from their homes in Missouri. Their      property, to the amount of two millions of dollars, has been taken      from them, or destroyed. Some of them have been murdered, beaten,      bruised, or lamed and have all been driven forth, wandering over      the world without homes, without property.        But the loss of property does not comprise half their sufferings.      They were human beings, possessed of human feelings and human      sympathies. Their agony of soul was the bitterest drop in the cup      of their sorrows.        For these wrongs, the \"Mormons\" ought to have some redress; yet      how and where shall they seek and obtain it? Your constitution      guarantees to every citizen, even the humblest, the enjoyment of      life, liberty, and property. It promises to all, religious freedom,      the right to all to worship God beneath their own vine and fig      tree, according to the dictates of their conscience. It guarantees      to all the citizens of the several states the right to become      citizens of any one of the states, and to enjoy all the rights and      immunities of the citizens of the state of his adoption. Yet of all      these rights have the \"Mormons\" been deprived. They have, without      a cause, without a trial, been deprived of life, liberty and      property. They have been persecuted for their religious opinions.      They have been driven from the state of Missouri, at the point of      the bayonet, and prevented from enjoying and exercising the rights      of citizens of the state of Missouri. It is the theory of our laws,      that for the protection of every legal right, there is provided a      legal remedy. What, then, we would respectfully ask, is the remedy      of the \"Mormons?\" Shall they apply to the legislature of the state      of Missouri for redress? They have done so. They have petitioned,      and these petitions have been treated with silence and contempt.      Shall they apply to the federal courts? They were, at the time of      the injury, citizens of the state of Missouri. Shall they apply      to the court of the state of Missouri? Whom {38} shall they sue?      The order for their destruction, then extermination, was granted      by the executive of the state of Missouri. Is not this a plea of      justification for the loss of individuals, done in pursuance of      that order? If not, before whom shall the \"Mormons\" institute a      trial? Shall they summon a jury of the individuals who composed the      mob? An appeal to them were in vain. They dare not go to Missouri      to institute a suit; their lives would be in danger.        For ourselves we see no redress, unless it is awarded by the      Congress of the United States. And here we make our appeal as      _American Citizens_, as _Christians_, and as _Men_--believing that      the high sense of justice which exists in your honorable body,      will not allow such oppression to be practiced upon any portion of      the citizens of this vast republic with impunity; but that some      measures which your wisdom may dictate, may be taken, so that the      great body of people who have been thus abused, may have redress      for the wrongs which they have suffered. And to your decision they      look with confidence; hoping it may be such as shall tend to dry up      the tear of the widow and orphan, and again place in situations of      peace, those who have been driven from their homes, and have had to      wade through scenes of sorrow and distress.        And your Memoralists, as in duty bound, will ever pray.    Footnotes:    1.

This is unfortunate, since he was truly a  noble character, and remained until his death (1843) a most faithful  friend of the Prophet's. In a book of Patriarchal blessings, given by  Hyrum Smith, is recorded a blessing upon the head of a James Adams,  who in every way would be such a man as the James Adams mentioned in  the text--I mean as to age, and character indicated in the blessing.

Be virtuous and pure; be men of integrity and      truth; keep the commandments of God; and then you will be able      more perfectly to understand the difference between right and      wrong--between the things of God and the things of men; and your      path will be like that of the just, which shineth brighter and      brighter unto the perfect day.        Be not so curious about tongues, do not speak in tongues except      there be an interpreter present; the ultimate design of tongues is      to speak to foreigners, and if persons are very anxious to display      their intelligence, let them speak to such in their own tongues.      The gifts of God are all useful in their place, but when they are      applied to that which God does not intend, they prove an injury, a      snare and a curse {32} instead of a blessing. We may some future      time enter more fully into this subject, but shall let this suffice      for the present.    _Thursday, 16_.--The following notice was published by the Nauvoo  [Masonic] lodge:        NOTICE.        To all whom it may concern, _greeting_:--Whereas, John Cook      Bennett, in the organization of the Nauvoo Lodge, under      dispensation palmed himself upon the fraternity as a regular mason,      in good standing: and satisfactory testimony having been produced      before said lodge, that he, said Bennett, was an expelled mason, we      therefore publish to all the masonic world the above facts that he,      the said Bennett, may not impose himself again upon the fraternity      of masons. All editors who are friendly to the fraternity of free      and accepted ancient York masons will please insert the above.        GEORGE MILLER,        Master of Nauvoo Lodge under Dispensation.

What have the Mormons done to Illinois? is the question which I      have frequently asked of those who are busy with the tongue of      slander in calumniating the Latter-day Saints, but as yet I have      found none who are willing to answer me honestly or correctly.      Perhaps many judge from rumor, not having investigated the matter      for themselves. I have, therefore, thought it might be well      to lay before the public some facts in relation to the case,      believing that there is a respectable portion of the community,      who, after having received correct information, will frown with      indignation upon the conduct of those who are endeavoring to raise      a persecution against our people.        In the first place, we would say, that where a crime is committed      there is a law broken, for if no law has been violated, there      cannot have been a crime committed; if, then, our people have      broken the law is there not power in those laws to vindicate      themselves, or to redress the wrongs of those who are injured?      We say there is; neither would we cast any aspersion upon the      characters of the administrators of the laws, as though they were      not vigilant in the discharge of their duty; we believe, with very      few exceptions, they have been vigilant.        With these facts before us, there is then no difficulty in      obtaining correct information as to the amount of crime committed      by the Mormons {33} throughout the state. You have only to refer      to the various dockets kept by the administrators of law, from the      highest court to the lowest, throughout the length and breadth      of the land, and there you will find recorded the crimes of the      Mormons, if it so be that they have committed any.        We say their faults are few compared to the population. Where is      there a record of murder committed by any of our people? None in      the State. Where is there a record against any of our people for      a penitentiary crime?--Not in the State. Where is there a record      of fine or county imprisonment (for any breach of law) against any      of the Latter-day Saints? I know of none in the State. If, then,      they have broken no law, they consequently have taken away no man's      rights--they have infringed upon no man's liberties.        We have been three years in this State, and have not asked for      any county or state office. Laws have been administered by those      not of our persuasion; administered rigorously, even against the      appearance of crime, and yet there has been no conviction of which      I have heard. Where is there another community in any state,      against none of whom there is a record of conviction for crime      in any court during the space of three years? And yet there are      those who cry out \"Treason! murder! bigamy! burglary! arson!\" and      everything that is evil, without being able to refer to a single      case that has ever been proved against the Mormons.        This, then, must be the \"head and front of our offending,\" that by      industry in both spiritual and temporal things, we are becoming a      great and numerous people; we convert our thousands and tens of      thousands yearly to the light of truth--to the glorious liberty of      the Gospel of Christ; we bring thousands from foreign lands, from      under the yoke of oppression and the iron hand of poverty, and we      place them in a situation where they can sustain themselves, which      is the highest act of charity toward the poor. We dry the widow's      tear, we fill the orphan's hand with bread, and clothe the naked;      we teach them principles of morality and righteousness, and they      rejoice in the God of Abraham and in the Holy One of Israel, and      are happy.        Thus it is with the honest in heart: but when the wicked creep in      amongst us for evil, to trample upon the most holy and virtuous      precepts, and find our moral and religious laws too strict for      them, they cry out, \"Delusion, false prophets, speculation,      oppression, illegal ordinances, usurpation of power, treason      against the government, &c. You must have your charters taken      away; you have dared to pass an ordinance against fornicators and      adulterers; you have forbidden the vending of spirituous liquors      within your city; you have passed an ordinance against vagrants      and disorderly persons; with many other high-handed {34} acts! You      even threaten to vote at the next election, and may be, (at least      we fear) you will send a member to the legislature; none of which      doings we, the good mobocrats and anti-Mormon politicians (and some      priests as well) are willing to bear.\"        This is the cry of the base and the vile, the priest and the      speculator, but the noble, the high-minded, the patriotic and the      virtuous breathe no such sentiment; neither will those who feel      an interest in the welfare of the state, for who does not know      that to increase the population ten thousand a year with the most      industrious people in the world, to pay thousands of dollars of      taxes, to bring into the state immense sums of gold and silver,      from all countries; to establish the greatest manufacturing city in      America (which Nauvoo will be in a few years,) and to create the      best produce market in the west,--is for the good and prosperity of      the community at large, and of the state of Illinois in particular.      As to the city ordinances we have passed all such as we deemed      necessary for the peace, welfare and happiness of the inhabitants,      whether Jew or Greek, Mohammedan, Roman Catholic, Latter-day Saint      or any other; that they all worship God according to their own      conscience, and enjoy the rights of American freemen.        WILLIAM LAW.        Nauvoo, June 17, 1842.    [Sidenote: The Prophet's Confirmation of Wm. Law's Defense of the  Saints.]    The above are plain matters of fact, that every one may become  acquainted with by reference to the county and state records. We might  add that in regard to moral principles, there is no city either in  this state, or in the United States that can compare with the city of  Nauvoo. You may live in our city for a month, and not hear an oath  sworn; you may be here as long and not see one person intoxicated.  So notorious are we for sobriety, that at the time the Washington  convention passed through our city a meeting was called for them, but  they expressed themselves at a loss what to say, as there were no  drunkards to speak to.    _Saturday, 18_.--The following brief extract is from the journal of  Elder Wilford Woodruff:    _Minutes of a Public Meeting in Nauvoo_.        The citizens of Nauvoo, both male and female, assembled near the      Temple for a general meeting; many thousands were assembled.      {35} Joseph the Seer arose and spoke his mind in great plainness      concerning the iniquity, hypocrisy, wickedness and corruption of      General John Cook Bennett. He also prophesied in the name of the      Lord, concerning the merchants in the city, that if they and the      rich did not open their hearts and contribute to the poor, they      would be cursed by the hand of God, and be cut off from the land of      the living.        The main part of the day was taken up upon the business of the      Agricultural and Manufacturing Society. Arrangements were entered      into to commence operations immediately, under the charter granted      by the legislature.        Also Joseph commanded the Twelve to organize the Church more      according to the law of God; that is to require of those that come      in to be settled according to their counsel, and also to appoint      a committee to wait upon all who arrive, make them welcome and      counsel them what to do.
