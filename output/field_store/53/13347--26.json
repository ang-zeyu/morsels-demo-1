The Variocoupler.--A variocoupler consists of a primary coil wound on  the outside of a tube of insulating material and to certain turns of  this taps are connected so that you can fix the wave length which your  aerial system is to receive from the shortest wave; i.e., 150 meters  on up by steps to the longest wave, i.e., 600 meters, which is the  range of most amateur variocouplers that are sold in the open market.  This is the part of the variocoupler that is called the _stator_.    The secondary coil is wound on the section of a ball mounted on a  shaft and this is swung in bearings on the stator so that it can turn  in it. This part of the variocoupler is called the _rotor_ and is  arranged so that it can be mounted on a panel and adjusted by means of  a knob or a dial. A diagram of a variocoupler is shown at A in Fig.  53, and the coupler itself at B. There are various makes and  modifications of variocouplers on the market but all of them are about  the same price which is $6.00 or $8.00.    [Illustration: Fig. 53.--How the Variocoupler is Made and Works.]    The Variometer.--This device is quite like the variocoupler, but with  these differences: (1) the rotor turns in the stator, which is also  the section of a ball, and (2) one end of the primary is connected  with one end of the secondary coil. To be really efficient a  variometer must have a small resistance and a large inductance as well  as a small dielectric loss. To secure the first two of these factors  the wire should be formed of a number of fine, pure copper wires each  of which is insulated and the whole strand then covered with silk.  This kind of wire is the best that has yet been devised for the  purpose and is sold under the trade name of _litzendraht_.    A new type of variometer has what is known as a _basket weave_, or  _wavy wound_ stator and rotor. There is no wood, insulating compound  or other dielectric materials in large enough quantities to absorb the  weak currents that flow between them, hence weaker sounds can be heard  when this kind of a variometer is used. With it you can tune sharply  to waves under 200 meters in length and up to and including wave  lengths of 360 meters. When amateur stations of small power are  sending on these short waves this style of variometer keeps the  electric oscillations at their greatest strength and, hence, the  reproduced sounds will be of maximum intensity. A wiring diagram of a  variometer is shown at A in Fig. 54 and a _basketball_ variometer is  shown complete at B.    [Illustration: Fig. 54.--How the Variometer is Made and Works.]    Connecting Up the Parts.--To hook-up the set connect the leading-in  wire to one end of the primary coil, or stator, of the variocoupler  and solder a wire to one of the taps that gives the longest wave  length you want to receive. Connect the other end of this wire with  one post of a .001 microfarad variable condenser and connect the other  post with the ground as shown in Fig. 55. Now connect one end of the  secondary coil, or rotor, to one post of a .0007 mfd. variable  condenser, the other post of this to one end of the grid coil and the  other end of this with the remaining end of the rotor of the  variocoupler.    [Illustration: Fig. 55.--Short Wave Regenerative Receiving Set (one  Variometer and three Variable Condensers.)]    Next connect one post of the .0007 mfd. condenser with one of the  terminals of the detector filament; then connect the other post of  this condenser with one post of the .0005 mfd. variable condenser and  the other post of this with the grid of the detector, then shunt the  megohm grid leak around the latter condenser. This done connect the  other terminal of the filament to one post of the rheostat, the other  post of this to the - or negative electrode of the 6 volt A  battery and the + or positive electrode of the latter to the other  terminal of the filament.    Shunt the potentiometer around the A battery and connect the sliding  contact with the - or zinc pole of the B battery and the + or carbon  pole with one terminal of the headphone; connect the other terminal to  one of the posts of the variometer and the other post of the  variometer to the plate of the detector. Finally shunt a .001 mfd.  fixed condenser around the headphones. If you want to amplify the  current with a vacuum tube amplifier connect in the terminals of the  amplifier circuit shown at A in Figs. 44 or 45 at the point where  they are connected with the secondary coil of the loose coupled tuning  coil, in those diagrams with the binding posts of Fig. 55 where the  phones are usually connected in.    Short Wave Regenerative Receiver. With Two Variometers and Two  Variable Condensers.--This type of regenerative receptor is very  popular with amateurs who are using high-grade short-wave sets. When  you connect up this receptor you must keep the various parts well  separated. Screw the variocoupler to the middle of the base board or  panel, and secure the variometers on either side of it so that the  distance between them will be 9 or 10 inches. By so placing them the  coupling will be the same on both sides and besides you can shield  them from each other easier.    For the shield use a sheet of copper on the back of the panel and  place a sheet of copper between the parts, or better, enclose the  variometers and detector and amplifying tubes if you use the latter in  sheet copper boxes. When you set up the variometers place them so that  their stators are at right angles to each other for otherwise the  magnetic lines of force set up by the coils of each one will be  mutually inductive and this will make the headphones or loud speaker  _howl_. Whatever tendency the receptor has to howl with this  arrangement can be overcome by putting in a grid leak of the right  resistance and adjusting the condenser.    The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.--For this set you require: (1)  one _variocoupler_; (2) two _variometers_; (3) one _.001 microfarad  variable condenser_; (4) one _.0005 microfarad variable condenser_;  (5) one _2 megohm grid leak resistance_; (6) one _vacuum tube  detector_; (7) one _6 volt A battery_; (8) one _200 ohm  potentiometer_; (9) one _22-1/2 volt B battery_; (10) one _.001  microfarad fixed condenser_, and (11) one pair of _2,000 ohm  headphones_.    To wire up the set begin by connecting the leading-in wire to the  fixed end of the primary coil, or _stator_, of the variocoupler, as  shown in Fig. 56, and connect one post of the .001 mfd. variable  condenser to the stator by soldering a short length of wire to the tap  of the latter that gives the longest wave you want to receive. Now  connect one end of the secondary coil, or _rotor_, of the variocoupler  with one post of the .0005 mfd. variable condenser and the other part  to the grid of the detector tube. Connect the other end of the rotor  of the variocoupler to one of the posts of the first variometer and  the other post of this to one of the terminals of the detector  filament.    [Illustration: Fig. 56.--Short Wave Regenerative Receiving Set (two  Variometers and two Variable Condensers.)]    Connect this filament terminal with the - or negative electrode of the  A battery and the + or positive electrode of this with one post  of the rheostat and lead a wire from the other post to the free  terminal of the filament. This done shunt the potential around the  A battery and connect the sliding contact to the - or zinc pole  of the B battery and the + or carbon pole of this to one  terminal of the headphones, while the other terminal of this leads to  one of the posts of the second variometer, the other post of which is  connected to the plate of the detector tube. If you want to add an  amplifier tube then connect it to the posts instead of the headphones  as described in the foregoing set.          CHAPTER XII    INTERMEDIATE AND LONG WAVE REGENERATIVE RECEIVING SETS      All receiving sets that receive over a range of wave lengths of from  150 meters to 3,000 meters are called _intermediate wave sets_ and all  sets that receive wave lengths over a range of anything more than  3,000 meters are called _long wave sets_. The range of intermediate  wave receptors is such that they will receive amateur, broadcasting,  ship and shore Navy, commercial, Arlington's time and all other  stations using _spark telegraph damped waves_ or _arc_ or _vacuum tube  telephone continuous waves_ but not _continuous wave telegraph  signals_, unless these have been broken up into groups at the  transmitting station. To receive continuous wave telegraph signals  requires receiving sets of special kind and these will be described in  the next chapter.    Intermediate Wave Receiving Sets.--There are two chief schemes  employed to increase the range of wave lengths that a set can receive  and these are by using: (1) _loading coils_ and _shunt condensers_,  and (2) _bank-wound coils_ and _variable condensers_. If you have a  short-wave set and plan to receive intermediate waves with it then  loading coils and fixed condensers shunted around them affords you the  way to do it, but if you prefer to buy a new receptor then the better  way is to get one with bank-wound coils and variable condensers; this  latter way preserves the electrical balance of the oscillation  circuits better, the electrical losses are less and the tuning easier  and sharper.    Intermediate Wave Set With Loading Coils.--For this intermediate wave  set you can use either of the short-wave sets described in the  foregoing chapter. For the loading coils use _honeycomb coils_, or  other good compact inductance coils, as shown in Chapter X and having  a range of whatever wave length you wish to receive. The following  table shows the range of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#19)"],[1,"it at once  direct to Count Wedel.\"    The Captain got up and, moving noiselessly to the door, opened it  swiftly.  There was no one about.    \"All right,\" he said, \"let me have it.\"    I repeated what I had memorized, what the Emperor had given me in the  secret chamber and immediately afterward destroyed all visible trace  of.  I said: \"On no account, it does not matter what official commands  you have received or may receive, are you to use open force when the  _Panther_ goes to Agidir.  No matter what stress is brought to bear  upon you by arising conditions, no matter what affront may be done  your code of naval honor, you are under no circumstances to use any  force against France or England.\"    Like myself, when the Emperor gave me that message, the Captain of the  _Panther_ was dumbfounded.  It was a direct contradiction of the  official orders he had received from the Foreign Office to go to  Morocco and make a demonstration against the French and the English  interests.  Those previous orders had been to create war, this verbal  message was to stop war.  Could the German \"jingos,\" the big gun  manufacturers, the shell people, the army and navy men, the powerful  feudal faction have heard me deliver that message to the Captain of  the _Panther_, they would have bellowed in rage.  The whole empire  wanted war, but the tired, swarthy faced man in the little underground  chamber at the Wilhelmstrasse, not \"absolutely absolute\" as he is  popularly supposed to be, deemed it wise not to fly in the face of  public opinion at the time and countermand the official orders to the  _Panther_.  So he had done so in the dark, verbally, by me, knowing  that so he served the best interests of his empire.    The rest is contemporary history.  You remember how, on Sunday  morning, July 7, the _Panther_ steamed to Morocco, how it forced its  way into the harbor of Agadir and created an international sensation  by remaining there more than two weeks.  You remember how a French and  an English warship came simultaneously, how they formed in what was  equivalent to common line and how, with officers and everybody itching  to open fire, war just missed being precipitated.  You may not know  that the British and French officers sent an ultimatum to the Captain  of the _Panther_.  Unless he left Agadir he would be forced to leave.  That meant war.    Now, had the Captain of the _Panther_ not received the private message  from the Emperor, he would have been forced by his naval code to  resist this ultimatum by force.  Had he gone there acting under the  original official orders, red war would have blazed across in Agadir  Harbor.  The slightest slip would have caused it--the report of a  rifle.  But the _Panther_ steamed away.    And this is the cleverest part of the Emperor's scheme; he knew that  France and England were allies, he didn't know, though, just how  sincere this alliance was.  By sending the _Panther_ into Agadir he  learned that the _entente cordiale_ really meant something, that  England and France were allies, that they were prepared to resist  Germany shoulder to shoulder in war.  It took a master stroke to bring  the situation up to the point of war--for it was a dangerous business,  with all Germany roaring for war--and then avert war when England and  France were on the verge of it.  But with his verbal message the  Emperor shrewdly accomplished it.  The results were before him.  By  creating the situation he knew that he had two powerful nations  opposed to him.  Good!    What he would do now would be to try to take one nation and secretly  ally himself with it, leaving the other out in the cold.  Then began  the intrigues which planned the isolation of France, an amazing  situation, a bombshell in present day international diplomacy, that I  shall discuss fully in the next chapter.      Chapter VIII. The Isolation of France    After my experiences with the earlier stages of the French, English,  and German situation, I was quite prepared for the most unexpected  developments.  What occurred in the middle of October, 1911, was,  however, beyond what I had imagined.  The Morocco incident had shown  the German Emperor that the _entente cordiale_ was indeed solid.  England and France would stand shoulder to shoulder in war.  Being  used to the ways of German diplomacy, I knew that from the  Wilhelmstrasse would come a quick countermove.  I guessed, too, that  when it came I would be employed.  It stood to reason that, knowing so  much of the trend and importance of the affair--I had seen the  intrigue grow step by step--I was the logical choice.    Nor was my reasoning at fault.  I soon received the expected summons,  and it brought me into the most amazing of my diplomatic adventures-a  mission which showed me the utter ruthlessness that characterizes  foreign ministers, particularly when the vital interests of their  countries are concerned.    Word to appear at the Wilhelmstrasse came when the autumn holidays  were in full swing.  The usual procedure of the Foreign Office having  been observed, I found myself in Count von Wedel's private study.  After an invitation to be seated, the Count surprised me.  He  complimented me on my previous missions on the _entente cordiale_  situation, and handed me a pretty substantial check.  It was actually  10,000 marks--$2,500--which the stubs of the royal check book will  show.    As I took the money he remarked \"Seine MajestÃ¤t\"--Foreign Office  brevity for conveying that His Majesty was satisfied.  Without more  ado, von Wedel plunged into the subject.  Leaning back and crossing  his legs, he began to talk in his abrupt way.    \"I want you to go with his Excellency, Herr von Kinderlen-Waechter, as  his private attendant and secretary,'' began von Wedel.  \"I have  selected you because of your knowledge of English and your insight  into the whole matter in hand.  There is to be a meeting of certain  statesmen in a certain spot in the range of the Schwarzwald.  You are  to be the sole attendant of these gentlemen.  You'll see to it that  nothing of their identity becomes known.  You will look after them in  every way.  You will destroy all writing, such as paper and blotters.  You will burn any such things in the presence of Herr von  Kinderlen-Waechter.\"    He paused impressively, and I found my mind in a whirl.  What his  words portended I could guess.  This mission promised to be very  interesting indeed.    \"I want you to be at the place of meeting,\" von Wedel continued,  \"three days before the arrival of these gentlemen.  You will have to  make arrangements as regards catering and so forth.  You'll be the  only attendant.  Means have been taken to assure strict privacy in the  district.  Understand that we want this to be thoroughly cloaked.  I  suggest to you the idea of a hunting party.  The details I leave to  you.  The gentlemen in question may or may not be known to you.  I  shall write you their names.\"    His pen began scratching across a piece of paper, and I had a moment  in which to realize the grave importance of this mission: the future  of Germany menaced, complete isolation was in the making between  England, France, and Russia; and the Kaiser was about to save Germany  by a master stroke of diplomacy.  Of what tremendous importance it  was, however, I did not learn until I had gone down into the forest.    Looking up, von Wedel tossed a piece of paper across the desk to me  (the identical paper which has been reproduced in connection with this  article).  It bore these names in his handwriting:    Viscount Haldane, Winston Spencer Churchill, Admiral von Tirpitz,  General von Heeringen, General Moritz Ritter von Auffenberg, Herr von  Kinderlen-Waechter.    I suppose, had it been my first Secret Service mission instead of the  climax of eleven years in the service, I could not have controlled my  surprise.  These men, all meeting in a lonely spot in Taunus Hills  region, foretold a grave situation.  Especially was this true in view  of the newspapers of Europe.  Here was all the press having Germany  and England ready to rush at each other's throats in war.  It was the  time of the German spy scare in England.  And now here were the two  powerful members of the English Cabinet meeting the Kaiser's Minister  of War secretly.    I also knew of a secret visit Churchill and Haldane had made at the  Foreign Office's invitation.  Significantly these English diplomats  had been shown certain of Germany's preparations for war, notably war  in the sky.    But von Wedel was not yet through.    \"These gentlemen,\" he said, \"will meet at Schlangenbad about the  middle of this month.  You know the place, in the Taunus Hills--one of  the Emperor's hunting lodges.  I suggest that you get down there  to-morrow and have everything ready.  You thoroughly know what is  required of you, Doctor?\"    On my assenting I was dismissed.  I lost no time in getting home to my  quarters and into comfortable togs.  This mission needed some thinking  out.  And after I told my Basuto boy to pack my bag, I glanced again  at the list von Wedel had given me.    Haldane, Lord Chancellor of England, persona grata with the Kaiser--in  fact, a personal friend.  Churchill, First Lord of the British  Admiralty.  Waechter, the German Minister of Foreign Affairs and,  despite court opposition, the trusted man of the Kaiser.  Tirpitz and  von Heeringen, chiefs of the German navy and army staffs, the latter a  second Moltke.  When I came to von Auffenberg's name I whistled.  Von  Auffenberg was Minister of War and the right-hand man of the  Chancellor of the Austrian Empire.  Thus three great powers were  represented.  Six men of this eminence, the brains and force of three  nations, to meet in secret in a little obscure hunting lodge in the  forest!  It portended darkly for France; but how darkly I could not  then conjecture.  It interested me tremendously, but I consoled myself  that I"]]]
