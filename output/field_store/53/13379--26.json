I said,  'I'll take the iron one;' for I thought in my heart that if an attack  should come on me, I could defend myself better with the iron than the  wooden pike.    \"Yellow Face gave me the iron pike, and the first chance of taking what  I could out of the pot on the point of the pike. I got but a small  piece of the stork, and the man of the house took all the rest on his  wooden pike. We had to fast that night; and when the man and his twelve  daughters ate the flesh of the stork, they hurled the bare bones in the  faces of my sons and myself. We had to stop all night that way, beaten  on the faces by the bones of the stork.    \"Next morning, when we were going away, the man of the house asked me  to stay a while; and going into the next room, he brought out twelve  loops of iron and one of wood, and said to me: 'Put the heads of your  twelve sons into the iron loops, or your own head into the wooden one;'  and I said: 'I'll put the twelve heads of my sons in the iron loops,  and keep my own out of the wooden one.'    \"He put the iron loops on the necks of my twelve sons, and put the  wooden one on his own neck. Then he snapped the loops one after  another, till he took the heads off my twelve sons and threw the heads  and bodies out of the house; but he did nothing to hurt his own neck.    \"When he had killed my sons he took hold of me and stripped the skin  and flesh from the small of my back down, and when he had done that he  took the skin of a black sheep that had been hanging on the wall for  seven years and clapped it on my body in place of my own flesh and  skin; and the sheepskin grew on me, and every year since then I shear  myself, and every bit of wool I use for the stockings that I wear I  clip off my own back.\"    When he had said this, the Gruagach showed the cowboy his back covered  with thick black wool.    After what he had seen and heard, the cowboy said: \"I know now why you  don't laugh, and small blame to you. But does that hare come here  still?\"    \"He does indeed,\" said the Gruagach.    Both went to the table to play, and they were not long playing cards  when the hare ran in; and before they could stop him he was out again.    But the cowboy made after the hare, and the Gruagach after the cowboy,  and they ran as fast as ever their legs could carry them till  nightfall; and when the hare was entering the castle where the twelve  sons of the Gruagach were killed, the cowboy caught him by the two hind  legs and dashed out his brains against the wall; and the skull of the  hare was knocked into the chief room of the castle, and fell at the  feet of the master of the place.    \"Who has dared to interfere with my fighting pet?\" screamed Yellow Face.    \"I,\" said the cowboy; \"and if your pet had had manners, he might be  alive now.\"    The cowboy and the Gruagach stood by the fire. A stork was boiling in  the pot, as when the Gruagach came the first time. The master of the  house went into the next room and brought out an iron and a wooden  pike, and asked the cowboy which would he choose.    \"I'll take the wooden one,\" said the cowboy; \"and you may keep the iron  one for yourself.\"    So he took the wooden one; and going to the pot, brought out on the  pike all the stork except a small bite, and he and the Gruagach fell to  eating, and they were eating the flesh of the stork all night. The  cowboy and the Gruagach were at home in the place that time.    In the morning the master of the house went into the next room, took  down the twelve iron loops with a wooden one, brought them out, and  asked the cowboy which would he take, the twelve iron or the one wooden  loop.    \"What could I do with the twelve iron ones for myself or my master?  I'll take the wooden one.\"    He put it on, and taking the twelve iron loops, put them on the necks  of the twelve daughters of the house, then snapped the twelve heads off  them, and turning to their father, said: \"I'll do the same thing to you  unless you bring the twelve sons of my master to life, and make them as  well and strong as when you took their heads.\"    The master of the house went out and brought the twelve to life again;  and when the Gruagach saw all his sons alive and as well as ever, he  let a laugh out of himself, and all the Eastern world heard the laugh.    Then the cowboy said to the Gruagach: \"It's a bad thing you have done  to me, for the daughter of the king of Erin will be married the day  after your laugh is heard.\"    \"Oh! then we must be there in time,\" said the Gruagach; and they all  made away from the place as fast as ever they could, the cowboy, the  Gruagach, and his twelve sons.    They hurried on; and when within three miles of the king's castle there  was such a throng of people that no one could go a step ahead. \"We must  clear a road through this,\" said the cowboy.    \"We must indeed,\" said the Gruagach; and at it they went, threw the  people some on one side and some on the other, and soon they had an  opening for themselves to the king's castle.    As they went in, the daughter of the king of Erin and the son of the  king of Tisean were on their knees just going to be married. The cowboy  drew his hand on the bride-groom, and gave a blow that sent him  spinning till he stopped under a table at the other side of the room.    \"What scoundrel struck that blow?\" asked the king of Erin.    \"It was I,\" said the cowboy.    \"What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?\"    \"It was I who won your daughter, not he; and if you don't believe me,  the Gruagach Gaire is here himself. He'll tell you the whole story from  beginning to end, and show you the tongues of the giant.\"    So the Gruagach came up and told the king the whole story, how the Shee  an Gannon had become his cowboy, had guarded the five golden cows and  the bull without horns, cut off the heads of the five-headed giant,  killed the wizard hare, and brought his own twelve sons to life. \"And  then,\" said the Gruagach, \"he is the only man in the whole world I have  ever told why I stopped laughing, and the only one who has ever seen my  fleece of wool.\"    When the king of Erin heard what the Gruagach said, and saw the tongues  of the giant fitted in the head, he made the Shee an Gannon kneel down  by his daughter, and they were married on the spot.    Then the son of the king of Tisean was thrown into prison, and the next  day they put down a great fire, and the deceiver was burned to ashes.    The wedding lasted nine days, and the last day was better than the  first.          THE STORY-TELLER AT FAULT    At the time when the Tuatha De Dannan held the sovereignty of Ireland,  there reigned in Leinster a king, who was remarkably fond of hearing  stories. Like the other princes and chieftains of the island, he had a  favourite story-teller, who held a large estate from his Majesty, on  condition of telling him a new story every night of his life, before he  went to sleep. Many indeed were the stories he knew, so that he had  already reached a good old age without failing even for a single night  in his task; and such was the skill he displayed that whatever cares of  state or other annoyances might prey upon the monarch's mind, his  story-teller was sure to send him to sleep.    One morning the story-teller arose early, and as his custom was,  strolled out into his garden turning over in his mind incidents which  he might weave into a story for the king at night. But this morning he  found himself quite at fault; after pacing his whole demesne, he  returned to his house without being able to think of anything new or  strange. He found no difficulty in \"there was once a king who had three  sons\" or \"one day the king of all Ireland,\" but further than that he  could not get. At length he went in to breakfast, and found his wife  much perplexed at his delay.    \"Why don't you come to breakfast, my dear?\" said she.    \"I have no mind to eat anything,\" replied the story-teller; \"long as I  have been in the service of the king of Leinster, I never sat down to  breakfast without having a new story ready for the evening, but this  morning my mind is quite shut up, and I don't know what to do. I might  as well lie down and die at once. I'll be disgraced for ever this  evening, when the king calls for his story-teller.\"    Just at this moment the lady looked out of the window.    \"Do you see that black thing at the end of the field?\" said she.    \"I do,\" replied her husband.    They drew nigh, and saw a miserable looking old man lying on the ground  with a wooden leg placed beside him.    \"Who are you, my good man?\" asked the story-teller.    \"Oh, then, 'tis little matter who I am. I'm a poor, old, lame,  decrepit, miserable creature, sitting down here to rest awhile.\"    \"An' what are you doing with that box and dice I see in your hand?\"    \"I am waiting here to see if any one will play a game with me,\" replied  the beggar man.    \"Play with you! Why what has a poor old man like you to play for?\"    \"I have one hundred pieces of gold in this leathern purse,\" replied the  old man.    \"You may as well play with him,\" said the story-teller's wife; \"and  perhaps you'll have something to tell the king in the evening.\"    A smooth stone was placed between them, and upon it they cast their  throws.    It was but a little while and the story-teller lost every penny of his  money.    \"Much good may it do you, friend,\" said he. \"What better hap could I  look for, fool that I am!\"    \"Will you play again?\" asked the old man.    \"Don't be talking, man: you have all my money.\"    \"Haven't you chariot and horses and hounds?\"    \"Well, what of them!\"    \"I'll stake all the money I have against thine.\"    \"Nonsense, man! Do you think for all the money in Ireland, I'd run the  risk of seeing my lady tramp home on foot?\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#19)"],[1,"or, after all, it's only your assumption  that there's to be a victim and that the victim is to be flung off the  top of the cliffs. You yourself told me that you heard no allusion to a  possible murder.\"    \"That is so. But I heard some very plain words relating to the marriage of  the brother or the sister with the wife or the husband of the third person,  which implies the need for a crime.\"    They were sitting on the terrace of the casino, facing the stairs which run  down to the beach. They therefore overlooked the few privately-owned cabins  on the shingle, where a party of four men were playing bridge, while a  group of ladies sat talking and knitting.    A short distance away and nearer to the sea was another cabin, standing by  itself and closed.    Half-a-dozen bare-legged children were paddling in the water.    \"No,\" said Hortense, \"all this autumnal sweetness and charm fails to  attract me. I have so much faith in all your theories that I can't help  thinking, in spite of everything, of this dreadful problem. Which of those  people yonder is threatened? Death has already selected its victim. Who is  it? Is it that young, fair-haired woman, rocking herself and laughing? Is  it that tall man over there, smoking his cigar? And which of them has the  thought of murder hidden in his heart? All the people we see are quietly  enjoying themselves. Yet death is prowling among them.\"    \"Capital!\" said Renine. \"You too are becoming enthusiastic. What did I tell  you? The whole of life's an adventure; and nothing but adventure is worth  while. At the first breath of coming events, there you are, quivering in  every nerve. You share in all the tragedies stirring around you; and the  feeling of mystery awakens in the depths of your being. See, how closely  you are observing that couple who have just arrived. You never can tell:  that may be the gentleman who proposes to do away with his wife? Or perhaps  the lady contemplates making away with her husband?\"    \"The d'Ormevals? Never! A perfectly happy couple! Yesterday, at the hotel,  I had a long talk with the wife. And you yourself....\"    \"Oh, I played a round of golf with Jacques d'Ormeval, who rather fancies  himself as an athlete, and I played at dolls with their two charming little  girls!\"    The d'Ormevals came up and exchanged a few words with them. Madame  d'Ormeval said that her two daughters had gone back to Paris that morning  with their governess. Her husband, a great tall fellow with a yellow beard,  carrying his blazer over his arm and puffing out his chest under a cellular  shirt, complained of the heat:    \"Have you the key of the cabin, Therese?\" he asked his wife, when they had  left Renine and Hortense and stopped at the top of the stairs, a few yards  away.    \"Here it is,\" said the wife. \"Are you going to read your papers?\"    \"Yes. Unless we go for a stroll?...\"    \"I had rather wait till the afternoon: do you mind? I have a lot of letters  to write this morning.\"    \"Very well. We'll go on the cliff.\"    Hortense and Renine exchanged a glance of surprise. Was this suggestion  accidental? Or had they before them, contrary to their expectations, the  very couple of whom they were in search?    Hortense tried to laugh:    \"My heart is thumping,\" she said. \"Nevertheless, I absolutely refuse to  believe in anything so improbable. 'My husband and I have never had the  slightest quarrel,' she said to me. No, it's quite clear that those two get  on admirably.\"    \"We shall see presently, at the Trois Mathildes, if one of them comes to  meet the brother and sister.\"    M. d'Ormeval had gone down the stairs, while his wife stood leaning on the  balustrade of the terrace. She had a beautiful, slender, supple figure. Her  clear-cut profile was emphasized by a rather too prominent chin when at  rest; and, when it was not smiling, the face gave an expression of sadness  and suffering.    \"Have you lost something, Jacques?\" she called out to her husband, who was  stooping over the shingle.    \"Yes, the key,\" he said. \"It slipped out of my hand.\"    She went down to him and began to look also. For two or three minutes,  as they sheered off to the right and remained close to the bottom of the  under-cliff, they were invisible to Hortense and Renine. Their voices were  covered by the noise of a dispute which had arisen among the  bridge-players.    They reappeared almost simultaneously. Madame d'Ormeval slowly climbed a  few steps of the stairs and then stopped and turned her face towards the  sea. Her husband had thrown his blazer over his shoulders and was making  for the isolated cabin. As he passed the bridge-players, they asked him for  a decision, pointing to their cards spread out upon the table. But, with a  wave of the hand, he refused to give an opinion and walked on, covered the  thirty yards which divided them from the cabin, opened the door and went  in.    Therese d'Ormeval came back to the terrace and remained for ten minutes  sitting on a bench. Then she came out through the casino. Hortense, on  leaning forward, saw her entering one of the chalets annexed to the Hotel  Hauville and, a moment later, caught sight of her again on the balcony.    \"Eleven o'clock,\" said Renine. \"Whoever it is, he or she, or one of the  card-players, or one of their wives, it won't be long before some one goes  to the appointed place.\"    Nevertheless, twenty minutes passed and twenty-five; and no one stirred.    \"Perhaps Madame d'Ormeval has gone.\" Hortense suggested, anxiously. \"She is  no longer on her balcony.\"    \"If she is at the Trois Mathildes,\" said Renine, \"we will go and catch her  there.\"    He was rising to his feet, when a fresh discussion broke out among the  bridge-players and one of them exclaimed:    \"Let's put it to d'Ormeval.\"    \"Very well,\" said his adversary. \"I'll accept his decision ... if he  consents to act as umpire. He was rather huffy just now.\"    They called out:    \"D'Ormeval! D'Ormeval!\"    They then saw that d'Ormeval must have shut the door behind him, which kept  him in the half dark, the cabin being one of the sort that has no window.    \"He's asleep,\" cried one. \"Let's wake him up.\"    All four went to the cabin, began by calling to him and, on receiving no  answer, thumped on the door:    \"Hi! D'Ormeval! Are you asleep?\"    On the terrace Serge Renine suddenly leapt to his feet with so uneasy an  air that Hortense was astonished. He muttered:    \"If only it's not too late!\"    And, when Hortense asked him what he meant, he tore down the steps and  started running to the cabin. He reached it just as the bridge-players were  trying to break in the door:    \"Stop!\" he ordered. \"Things must be done in the regular fashion.\"    \"What things?\" they asked.    He examined the Venetian shutters at the top of each of the folding-doors  and, on finding that one of the upper slats was partly broken, hung on as  best he could to the roof of the cabin and cast a glance inside. Then he  said to the four men:    \"I was right in thinking that, if M. d'Ormeval did not reply, he must have  been prevented by some serious cause. There is every reason to believe that  M. d'Ormeval is wounded ... or dead.\"    \"Dead!\" they cried. \"What do you mean? He has only just left us.\"    Renine took out his knife, prized open the lock and pulled back the two  doors.    There were shouts of dismay. M. d'Ormeval was lying flat on his face,  clutching his jacket and his newspaper in his hands. Blood was flowing  from his back and staining his shirt.    \"Oh!\" said some one. \"He has killed himself!\"    \"How can he have killed himself?\" said Renine. \"The wound is right in the  middle of the back, at a place which the hand can't reach. And, besides,  there's not a knife in the cabin.\"    The others protested:    \"If so, he has been murdered. But that's impossible! There has been nobody  here. We should have seen, if there had been. Nobody could have passed us  without our seeing....\"    The other men, all the ladies and the children paddling in the sea had come  running up. Renine allowed no one to enter the cabin, except a doctor who  was present. But the doctor could only say that M. d'Ormeval was dead,  stabbed with a dagger.    At that moment, the mayor and the policeman arrived, together with some  people of the village. After the usual enquiries, they carried away the  body.    A few persons went on ahead to break the news to Therese d'Ormeval, who was  once more to be seen on her balcony.           *       *       *       *       *    And so the tragedy had taken place without any clue to explain how a man,  protected by a closed door with an uninjured lock, could have been murdered  in the space of a few minutes and in front of twenty witnesses, one might  almost say, twenty spectators. No one had entered the cabin. No one had  come out of it. As for the dagger with which M. d'Ormeval had been stabbed  between the shoulders, it could not be traced. And all this would have  suggested the idea of a trick of sleight-of-hand performed by a clever  conjuror, had it not concerned a terrible murder, committed under the most  mysterious conditions.    Hortense was unable to follow, as Renine would have liked, the small party  who were making for Madame d'Ormeval; she was paralysed with excitement and  incapable of moving. It was the first time that her adventures with Renine  had taken her into the very heart of the action and that, instead of noting  the consequences of a murder, or assisting in the pursuit of the criminals,  she found herself confronted with the murder itself.    It left her trembling all over; and she stammered: \"How horrible!... The  poor fellow!... Ah, Renine, you couldn't save him this time!... And that's  what upsets me more than anything, that we could and should have saved him,  since we knew of the plot....\"    Renine made her sniff at a bottle of salts; and when she had quite  recovered her composure, he said, while observing her"]]]
