Shure, if I'd known that was all the good it was,  it's meself wouldn't have filled me hot-beds wid it! The thrash!\"    One day he received a very long, narrow parcel and note through the mail.  Early next morning, I saw the old fellow sitting on a stump in the  garden, carefully spelling over the letter, which did not seem a long  one. When Harry ran up to him, Cahill brought the child back to me, and  looking all about to see that no one else was near, said, in a mysterious  tone--    \"See here, Miss F----. I got a parcel be the mail-man yesterday, an'  here's the spicification that came wid it. Would you read it, miss, and  till me who ye think would send it? I think meself it's a trick, an' I'll  be even wid thim yit.\" And he handed me a crumpled piece of paper about  four inches square, on which I read--      \"To Michael Cahill, Esq,    Office of the Civil Engineer,    Lake Diception      \"Sirs,      \"Hearin' ye were lately appointed Governmint gardner, we sind    a sample of our goods. Eny orders ye can sind will receive    prompt attintion.      \"Green and Brown, manufacturing company,      \"County of Limerick,      \"Ireland.\"    \"Of course it's a joke, Cahill,\" I said. \"But where's the sample?\"    \"Shure, I buried it behind the shanty; it's a wooden hoe, cut out o' the  root of a three, I think I know who sint it,\" he went on, drawing near,  with another cautious look round.    \"It was wrapped up wid some copies of the _Ottawa Citizen_  newspaper, an' there are only two min on the line that take it at all. So  ye see I can spot them!\" Fumbling in his pockets, he produced a scrap of  the paper, and, turning it this way and that, discovered some writing  which, upon close inspection, proved to be my own name. His tormentors  had wrapped it in one of the papers I had lent him.    To describe the old man's wrath and astonishment, mingled with keen sense  of fun (for an Irishman _can_ see a joke, even against himself), is  impossible. I had little trouble in persuading him that to take no notice  of either parcel or \"spicification\" would be the best way to disappoint  his foes. Long afterwards, whenever I met him, he gave me a knowing side  glance of mutual understanding that was irresistible.    In the mean time, the house was fast being rebuilt on the old site, but  on a much improved plan. The former had been a two-story building of  squared logs, and, to my eyes, an insult to the landscape. The new one, a  low cottage of rough logs, seemed to fit into the valley without marring  the view from any point. The beautiful wooded hall to the north, which  had been completely shut out by the old house, now formed a lovely  background to the cottage and garden.    The little Frenchman Martin, the master builder, was another character in  his way; a lively, energetic little fellow, whose eyes were everywhere.  Not the driving in of a single nail escaped him. Yet, with all his  watchfulness, he did more work than any three of his men. The habitual  use of salt pork and beans, added to the total absence of vegetable diet  during the long winter and summer, had caused scurvy to break out among  the men, and poor Martin was suffering very much from it. To keep him in  better health until the house was finished, Mrs. C---- supplied him with  potatoes, which he ate raw, sliced and soaked in vinegar; and I believe,  from a conversation I overheard between him and one of his men, that  these raw potatoes, bread, and tea constituted the man's entire food for  the last six weeks of his work on the line. Many others had not even the  potatoes, yet they daily passed the garden, where lettuces and other  vegetables, a cure for their sufferings, grew in profusion, and did not  take a leaf. I know, had I been in like case, early training would have  gone to the winds, and the eighth Commandment have become a dead letter.    We had unusual opportunities of seeing the real life of a navvy while we  lived in the shanty. Our men came from nearly all parts of the  world--Russia, Sweden, Germany, Holland, Iceland, Ireland, Great Britain,  and the Dominion. There were also many Scotch and French half-breeds, as  well as full-blooded Indians, among them, the contractors finding that  associating the various nationalities in camp was more conducive to peace  and obedience than when a large number of fellow-countrymen formed a  gang. Next to us, in reality under the same roof, was the store,  containing everything a navvy could want--from hats and boots to pickles  and tobacco.    Sunday, the only day off work, was the general shopping day, and as it  was also mail day the place was crowded, and the week's news discussed. A  little below the store was another large shanty, where about a hundred  and twenty men lived, the kitchen ruled over by a tall and rather  good-looking Frenchman, who had lived amongst the Indians at Fort Francis  so long that he spoke their language as well as they did. \"Black Joe,\" as  he was generally called, was an authority amongst the men, and was very  fond of a little black poodle, which he cared for as a child, spending  all his leisure, moments in fondling it and teaching it tricks. He had  an assistant named Ironsides, who was not only \"cookee,\" but could sew up  and dress a cut as well as the doctor, and his services were very often  called into requisition.    Sunday was washing day in camp, too; every tub was in use, and every low  branch or rude fence hung with the men's clothes. In one place you would  see a man sitting on a stump to have his hair cut; another repairing the  week's wear and tear of his garments. A group of interested listeners lie  or sit round the happy possessor of the latest paper, who is reading it  aloud. Others, of livelier tastes, gather round an accordion-player, who  gives the \"Marseillaise\" with the fire and feeling of a true artist. Some  hard workers, whose idea of pleasure is perfect rest, lie on their backs  in the sun, with their hats tilted over their faces, sound asleep,  heedless of the roars of laughter from a cluster of men, to whom old  Cahill is relating one of his most wonderful stories; others stand before  a small looking-glass, hung against a tree, performing their toilets  with immense satisfaction; while more active spirits are on their way to  the lake, with their fishing tackle, for a long day's sport.    Card-playing was forbidden in camp. Of course there were a few who  gambled in defiance of orders, but when detected they were at once  dismissed by the superintendent, who declared that they ought not to  profane the Sabbath. Mr. K---- was strict, and apparently severe with the  men, yet he was a general favourite. He avowed one day that he could  manage any number of men, but the \"weemin were beyond him.\" The  contractor had tried employing women cooks, believing that they would be  more economical than the men; but those he engaged were such a trouble to  look after, that he declared \"either he or thim weemin would have to  leave the line.\" One woman cook was called by the men \"7-10,\" from her  great size, and her camp being at 7-10 station. On her way across the  Lake of the Woods after her dismissal, the big steamer, as usual, ran on  a rock, and the passengers had to be transferred to a row-boat large  enough to hold thirty people. \"7-10\" refusing assistance, and attempting  to jump into the boat, jumped completely _over_ it, and was dragged  out of the water by the laughing crew, who dubbed the rock \"7-10's Leap.\"    Mr. C---- had all the stores of provisions which were saved from the fire  put into a small root-house under the north hill. The ice in the lakes  having broken up unusually early the bad state of the roads during the  winter made it necessary for all supplies brought out on the contract to  be \"packed\"--that is, carried on men's backs. Each man being paid two  dollars a day, and not averaging more than sixteen miles, made this a  very expensive process; consequently our supplies became valuable, only  what was absolutely indispensable being sent for till the Dawson road was  passable and the steamer running. One morning I saw Cahill peering into  the root-house, and evidently watching something with great interest.  Then he ran to the shanty for his gun, and my curiosity being aroused, I  inquired what was the matter. Touching the brim of his old straw hat, he  replied, \"Shure, it's fine prey I've got to shoot this mornin', Miss F----.  As beautiful a skunk as ever ye see!\" and levelling the gun, he was  about to shoot, when memories of former odours made me implore him to  desist. \"But he'll ate all the pork!\" the old fellow remonstrated, much  aggrieved at being deprived of so fine an opportunity of displaying his  prowess. I assured him that, if let alone, the \"beautiful skunk\" would go  quietly away when he had enjoyed a good meal; but, if disturbed, he would  use his natural weapon of defence, and destroy everything in the  root-house. But--      \"A man convinced against his will    Is of the same opinion still,\"    and old Cahill, though he shouldered his weapon and walked away, grumbled  as he went. We paid frequent visits to the root-house that morning to see  if the intruder had gone, but he did not leave until the middle of the  second day. Skunks, or polecats, are not numerous in that part of the  country. The dogs sometimes came in from a hunt very strongly scented by  them, but, with the exception of our visitor, we never saw one about the  premises. They abound in prairies and swampy grounds, and when attacked  the odour they emit is overpowering and indescribable; without exception  the worst that ever assailed our nostrils.    As the spring wore on we spent the brightening days in gathering  wild-flowers, going fishing, and repeating the weekly routine of a quiet  life in the woods. The weather grew hotter, the flies more plentiful, and  our highest gratification seemed to be to make a good "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#19)"],[1," said nothing, but taking another  similar-shaped bit of potsherd, she wrote on it these words--\"Take  care of this lad, giving him all he desires,\" and returned it to the  son of seven Queens, who, none the wiser, set off on his quest.    Ere long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch's  mother, a hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully on reading the  message, especially when the lad asked for the necklace of eyes.  Nevertheless she took it off, and gave it him, saying, \"There are only  thirteen of 'em now, for I lost one last week.\"    The lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so he hurried  home as fast as he could to his seven mothers, and gave two eyes  apiece to the six elder Queens; but to the youngest he gave one,  saying, \"Dearest little mother!--I will be your other eye always!\"    After this he set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised, but  when passing by the white Queen's palace he saw some pigeons on the  roof. Drawing his bow, he shot one, and it came fluttering past the  window. The white hind looked out, and lo! there was the King's son  alive and well.    She cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the lad, asked him  how he had returned so soon, and when she heard how he had brought  home the thirteen eyes, and given them to the seven blind Queens, she  could hardly restrain her rage. Nevertheless she pretended to be  charmed with his success, and told him that if he would give her this  pigeon also, she would reward him with the Jogi's wonderful cow, whose  milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big as a kingdom. The  lad, nothing loth, gave her the pigeon; whereupon, as before, she bade  him go ask her mother for the cow, and gave him a potsherd whereon was  written--\"Kill this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood like  water!\"    But on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the Princess, just  to tell her how he came to be delayed, and she, after reading the  message on the potsherd, gave him another in its stead; so that when  the lad reached the old hag's hut and asked her for the Jogi's cow,  she could not refuse, but told the boy how to find it; and bidding him  of all things not to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who  kept watch and ward over the treasure, told him to be off before she  became too angry at her daughter's foolishness in thus giving away so  many good things.    Then the lad did as he had been told bravely. He journeyed on and on  till he came to a milk-white pond, guarded by the eighteen thousand  demons. They were really frightful to behold, but, plucking up  courage, he whistled a tune as he walked through them, looking neither  to the right nor the left. By-and-by he came upon the Jogi's cow,  tall, white, and beautiful, while the Jogi himself, who was king of  all the demons, sat milking her day and night, and the milk streamed  from her udder, filling the milk-white tank.    The Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, \"What do you want  here?\"    Then the lad answered, according to the old hag's bidding, \"I want  your skin, for King Indra is making a new kettle-drum, and says your  skin is nice and tough.\"    Upon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn or Jogi  dares disobey King Indra's command), and, falling at the lad's feet,  cried, \"If you will spare me I will give you anything I possess, even  my beautiful white cow!\"    To this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended hesitation,  agreed, saying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice  tough skin like the Jogi's elsewhere; so, driving the wonderful cow  before him, he set off homewards. The seven Queens were delighted to  possess so marvellous an animal, and though they toiled from morning  till night making curds and whey, besides selling milk to the  confectioners, they could not use half the cow gave, and became richer  and richer day by day.    Seeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens started with a  light heart to marry the Princess; but when passing the white hind's  palace he could not resist sending a bolt at some pigeons which were  cooing on the parapet. One fell dead just beneath the window where the  white Queen was sitting. Looking out, she saw the lad hale and hearty  standing before her, and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.    She sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and when she  heard how kindly her mother had received him, she very nearly had a  fit; however, she dissembled her feelings as well as she could, and,  smiling sweetly, said she was glad to have been able to fulfil her  promise, and that if he would give her this third pigeon, she would do  yet more for him than she had done before, by giving him the  million-fold rice, which ripens in one night.    The lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving up the  pigeon, set off on his quest, armed as before with a potsherd, on  which was written, \"Do not fail this time. Kill the lad, and sprinkle  his blood like water!\"    But when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her becoming  anxious about him, she asked to see the potsherd as usual, and  substituted another, on which was written, \"Yet again give this lad  all he requires, for his blood shall be as your blood!\"    Now when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad wanted the  million-fold rice which ripens in a single night, she fell into the  most furious rage, but being terribly afraid of her daughter, she  controlled herself, and bade the boy go and find the field guarded by  eighteen millions of demons, warning him on no account to look back  after having plucked the tallest spike of rice, which grew in the  centre.    So the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the field where,  guarded by eighteen millions of demons, the million-fold rice grew. He  walked on bravely, looking neither to the right or left, till he  reached the centre and plucked the tallest ear, but as he turned  homewards a thousand sweet voices rose behind him, crying in tenderest  accents, \"Pluck me too! oh, please pluck me too!\" He looked back, and  lo! there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes!    Now as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old hag grew  uneasy, remembering the message \"his blood shall be as your blood\"; so  she set off to see what had happened.    Soon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her arts what it  was, she took a little water, and kneading the ashes into a paste,  formed it into the likeness of a man; then, putting a drop of blood  from her little finger into its mouth, she blew on it, and instantly  the son of seven Queens started up as well as ever.    \"Don't you disobey orders again!\" grumbled the old hag, \"or next time  I'll leave you alone. Now be off, before I repent of my kindness!\"    [Illustration:]    So the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven mothers,  who, by the aid of the million-fold rice, soon became the richest  people in the kingdom. Then they celebrated their son's marriage to  the clever Princess with all imaginable pomp; but the bride was so  clever, she would not rest until she had made known her husband to his  father, and punished the wicked white witch. So she made her husband  build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven Queens had  lived, and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendour. Then, when  all was prepared, she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King.  Now the King had heard much of the mysterious son of seven Queens, and  his marvellous wealth, so he gladly accepted the invitation; but what  was his astonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a  facsimile of his own in every particular! And when his host, richly  attired, led him straight to the private hall, where on royal thrones  sat the seven Queens, dressed as he had last seen them, he was  speechless with surprise, until the Princess, coming forward, threw  herself at his feet, and told him the whole story. Then the King awoke  from his enchantment, and his anger rose against the wicked white hind  who had bewitched him so long, until he could not contain himself. So  she was put to death, and her grave ploughed over, and after that the  seven Queens returned to their own splendid palace, and everybody  lived happily.          A Lesson for Kings    [Illustration:]      Once upon a time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the  future Buddha returned to life as his son and heir. And when the day  came for choosing a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew  up in due course; and when he was sixteen years old, went to  Takkasila, and became accomplished in all arts. And after his father  died he ascended the throne, and ruled the kingdom with righteousness  and equity. He gave judgments without partiality, hatred, ignorance,  or fear. Since he thus reigned with justice, with justice also his  ministers administered the law. Law-suits being thus decided with  justice, there were none who brought false cases. And as these ceased,  the noise and tumult of litigation ceased in the king's court. Though  the judges sat all day in the court, they had to leave without any one  coming for justice. It came to this, that the Hall of Justice would  have to be closed!    Then the future Buddha thought, \"It cannot be from my reigning with  righteousness that none come for judgment; the bustle has ceased, and  the Hall of Justice will have to be closed. I must, therefore, now  examine into my own faults; and if I find that anything is wrong in  me, put that away, and practise only virtue.\"    Thenceforth he sought for some one to tell him his faults, but among  those around him he found no one who would tell him of any fault, but  heard only his own praise.    Then he thought, \"It is from fear of me that these men speak only good  things, and not evil things,\" and he sought among those people who  lived outside "]]]
