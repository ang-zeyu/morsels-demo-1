The farther we travelled westwards, the broader became the  maritime plain, and the richer its clothing of shrubs and grass.  Besides the ordinary acacias, which were finer and more numerous,  there were many patches of the bastard cypress and tall rank grasses  growing on sandy hillocks, in the same way as they do in India. The  Somali exultingly pointed this out as a paradise, replete with every  necessary for life's enjoyment, and begged to know if the English had  any country pastures like it, where camels and sheep can roam about  the whole year round without exhausting it.    31st.--To-day we made a short march, passing through Ain Tarad, and  encamping on a grazing-ground one mile to its westward. The village,  as usual, was close to the shore, for the convenience of shipping. It  is not half the size of Kurrum, but boasts of a fort of recent  construction, with six rusty pieces of cannon lying on the sand in  front of it. An Akil, named Abdie, being chief of the place, is the  lordly proprietor of these instruments of defence.    On first entering the place he advanced to receive me, and politely  said, \"Had you not dropped so suddenly in upon me this morning, it was  my intention to have welcomed you with a royal salute, for the honour  you have done, as the representative of the English, in paying me this  visit.\" This speech, though showing what his feelings were towards me,  was obviously a matter of simple palaver; for, in the first place, the  guns could not have possibly been fired without occasioning their  total destruction; and it was doubtful if he possessed any powder.  Whilst sitting in his village, and drinking a bowl of sour curd--the  first thing always offered to a visitor--I observed a group of old men  sitting, in hot discussion on some knotty point, under the lee of the  fort, and desired the Balyuz to ascertain the purport of the arguments  under debate, as by their gesticulations I could plainly see it had  some connection with my coming here.    After joining them and listening some time, he returned to say they  were discussing the possibility of our expedition ever reaching the  Webbé (River) Shebéli; to go as far as Ugahden, they thought, was out  of the question. Hearing this, I went up to them, and asked what  reasons they had for thinking so. They replied openly that the Somali  would stop us before we got half-way. The Balyuz then interposed,  saying, \"But the British are strong, and can do anything, they like.\"  Hearing this, they laughingly replied, \"If the Somali came down to  fight, and then ran away back into the fastnesses of their hills, what  would the English do then, who cannot live a day without drinking beer  and eating meat? whereas the Somali can do very well without anything,  seldom requiring even water, and not more than one morsel of meat, for  a whole week together.\" I concluded the argument by saying, \"Without  any exertion on our parts, we could cripple you at once; we have the  seaboard in our hands, and at any moment could stop your trade, so  that neither grain nor clothing would ever be supplied you; besides,  if we wished, we could take quiet occupation of your hills and  watering-places, and then what would become of you?\" The sages mildly  shook their heads, and said the English were indeed Shaitans (devils),  and that they had never looked at their position in that light before.  I then repaired to the camp, and found the cattle, as usual, gone out  to graze, under charge of their drivers and two soldiers. In the  evening, when the animals were brought home to be picketed, one pony  and one camel were found wanting.    I sent men immediately to track the missing ones down, when it was  discovered by footprints that some savages had singled them out from  the herd, had driven them gently into a deep ravine, and when there  out of sight had hurried them off to the hills lying beyond the plain.  This open plunder on the coast, where British authority seemed to  prevail, was monstrous. I summoned Abdie, as chief of the place, told  him the whole story, and demanded that he should produce the missing  animals immediately, as it was impossible for him not to be cognisant  of the transaction. He said he did not then know who had stolen them,  but I might rest satisfied he would find out by the morning, and they  should be returned intact. He assured me he was lord of all he  surveyed, and his power was infinite within the limits of his clan.  The same night he brought back the pony, and said he would produce the  camel in the morning. I believed he had played this trick himself to  show the effect of his power, and so did the Balyuz; but he said he  had been obliged to pay ten dollars to the thief before he would give  it up. I now demanded he would produce the thief for trial, suspecting  that thief to be himself, but he said he could not. This reply made  the Balyuz knowingly cock his eye. The next day, as the camel did not  come by noon, I wrote a letter to Aden reporting the circumstance, and  begging some retribution would be taken from the Akil, as it was  obvious to any man who knows these savages, that Abdie could not have  been ignorant of one single feature in the whole of these  transactions. Though the loss was small, I did not think it of little  importance, as it remained a precedent, if overlooked, for the  committal of greater deeds; and the place, being a port, was open to  the exaction by blockade of any fines--which, without doubt, is the  true way to make Somali feel.    During that day and the succeeding one we travelled along the coast to  Siyareh, a small dilapidated fort,[27] standing alone without any  other habitation, as if only intended for a traveller's lodge. Near it  was an old well, said to be of antique construction, sunk by the  former occupants of the land. As we increased our distance westwards,  the maritime plain also enlarged, and was bounded to the southwards by  small irregularly-disposed hills, all brown and dreary-looking as  before. To judge from the quantity of vegetation, it would appear that  water is nearer the surface here than elsewhere, though there was none  of any importance to be seen. These few marches, slight as they were,  served to prove the stamina of the soldiers, and showed the Seedis to  have twice the heart and bottom of the Egyptians, who succumbed at  once to the influences of the sun and fatigue of marching.    3d April.--The caravan broke ground at 2 A.M., and, after travelling  over much the same ground as yesterday, nearly the whole day long  without passing a single habitation, arrived in the evening at  Berbera. Here I was warmly met by my companions, Herne and Stroyan,  and began again a social life of great enjoyment. Berbera was in the  plenitude of its prosperity. Its market was full of life and bustle,  and the harbour was full of native Oriental craft. Our camp was  pitched on a little rise in the land, facing the east and overlooking  the fair. Our tents, three in number, were formed in line--Stroyan's  on the right, Herne's in the centre, and mine on the left flank  nearest the sea, and each about a dozen yards apart. Herne had  procured his fair share of animals, and we mustered from forty to  fifty camels and six or seven ponies and mules, including those I  brought. These at night-time were all tethered in front of our tents,  and guarded by a sentry. During the day they were always sent out to  graze under an escort of soldiers, with Somali archers to look after  them. The boxes, pack-saddles, and grain were placed between the  central tent and mine, whilst the dates and more precious cloths I  kept underneath my tent. Including ourselves, servants, guards, and  camel-tenders, we mustered in all about forty souls; amongst these  were the two Abbans of Herne and Stroyan, who, now matters had gone so  far, could not prudently be dispensed with; but my man, the Balyuz,  was considered chief, or Ras Cafila.    During the four days succeeding my arrival I inspected the fair and  shipping. The marketplace was supposed to contain upwards of 60,000  people,[28] Banyans from Cutch and Aden, Arab merchants and Somali,  who had been gradually flocking in from about the 15th November; and  as they arrived they erected mat huts as booths for carrying on their  bartering trade. According to Herne's investigations, the Somali took  coarse cloths, such as American and English sheeting, black and  indigo-dyed stuffs, and cotton nets (worn by married women generally  to encase their hair), small bars of iron and steel, as well as zinc  and lead, beads of various sorts, and dates and rice. In exchange for  these, they exported slaves, cattle, gums of all sorts, ghee, ivory,  ostrich-feathers, and rhinoceros-horns.    7th.--At sunrise this morning a very interesting scene took place in  the arrival of the great annual Harar caravan,--a large body, composed  of an aggregate of numerous small caravans, which all march together  that their combined strength may give mutual support. Down the whole  breadth of the plain, like a busy stream of ants, they came in single  file, one camel's nose tied to his leader's tail. Immediately on their  flanks were Somali, armed with spear and bow, the men who tended them  and looked after the loading. Outside them again were occasional  detachments of men riding ponies, all armed, and guarding the caravan  from sudden surprise or attack. In this caravan alone there were about  three thousand people, as many head of cattle, and 500 or more slaves,  all driven chained together for sale in the market. A little later the  same morning a second excitement enlivened our little camp in the  approach of a man-of-war, which came sailing up the coast in full  sail, looking like a giant swan in contrast to the little ducks of  native shipping. It was the Hon. East India Company's schooner Mahi,  commanded by Lieutenant King, conveying our Captain,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#19)"],[1," the Voyage than parties of the Same Number  is in any other Situation Turners have been troublesom to them all    From this evenings incampment a man may walk to the Pane Village on the  S bank of the Platt River in two days, and to the Otteaus in one day  all those Indians are Situated on the South bank of the Plate River, as  those Indians are now out in the praries following & Hunting the  buffalow, I fear we will not See them.
